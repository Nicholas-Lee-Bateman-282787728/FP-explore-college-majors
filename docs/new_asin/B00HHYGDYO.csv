8632894,2,B00HHYGDYO,Not exactly the guitar training I hoped for based on the description. The description isn't exactly what the DVD is - there are no scales or progressions or basics as described. I had hoped for a step by step and this DVD skips many steps and really is a training more in strength and technique than in an overview. I was disappointed but I should have known better as the homespun dvds are often disappointing. More step by step needed and less an exercise in narcissism- how much the teachers already know - we watch them play but they don't provide a good step by step.,1482796800,,572,4.40566037735849

8632896,5,B00HHYGDYO,"great condensed teaching,  no messing.  ..  not the fastest and smoothest player (like stochelo), but has something different,..great gypsy groove and melody, very unique with a spirit of django in there.  really pleased with this,..i bought the other two from when pauln looked a little younger, and these were great too, but a little slower in what you learned..this one really is full on",1412467200,4,390,5.046875
8632897,5,B00HHYGDYO,"I tried to learn this style from John Jorgenson's books/cds and had no luck. I bought Mr Mehling's dvd and this style became very clear and apparent to me. This guy is an excellent teacher and I'd love to study with him personally some day.
This was an excellent value and you won't find more than a few segments of his stuff on Youtube.",1406160000,3,337,4.28125
