I thought the comparison of the M-16 with the Russian AK-47 and AK-74 was very interesting. After watching this dvd I believe I could load and fire a WWII machine gun.

For less than $10 its a real deal for a gun lover!",1233360000,,385,4.319444444444445
8251849,2,B0013LPRQM,"On the box of this dual dvd set, one is lead to believe this is a comprehensive history of firearms from their humble and primitive beginnings to the sophisticated weapons of today.  Not quite.

What we have here are really a series of crude, amateurish and recycled US Army training films from the early 1980's that are as engaging as old reruns from the ""A-Team"".  A few of the segments are vintage WWII training films in color, like ""Meet the Enemy,"" a 20 minute army training film on German battle tactics in the field.  But this is not enough to recommend this set.  I purchased my set for $4.99 at Ross-Dress For Less than the $9.99 list price here on Amazon.  Nonetheless, even a two star rating is too generous for this dvd set.",1207180800,3,736,4.455223880597015
