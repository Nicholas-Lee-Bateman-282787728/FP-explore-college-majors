1040166,5,630549519X,"There's two types of humor, in my opinion.  There's surface humor: that's slapstick, the Farrely brothers, Jim Carrey (most of the time), Airplane!, and Carrottop.  Then there's deeper humor, that can be funny on the  surface, but has something deeper beneath it:  The Cohen Brothers, Being  John Malkovich, Catch-22, George Carlin...you get the idea.
Julia  Sweeny's one-woman-show-turned-movie (produced by Quentin Tarantino) is  that second type of humor; deeper, and funny in a way that not only makes  you smile on the outside but (pardon the cheesiness) also smile on the  inside.  This show/movie, ""God Said Ha!"", is basically the story  of how her brother got cancer (lymphoma) and moved in with her, so she  could take care of him.  Pretty soon after, their parents move in with  them, and Julia Sweeny does a great job of immitating her mother in such a  way that we laugh, but also recognize the truth in her recreation.
Some  of what Julia discusses is terribly upsetting; like when her brother has to  have a spiget-like thing installed in his head so they can get the medicine  directly into his cranium.  But her brother retains his humor throughout  this terrible experience, and after the doctor tells him that everyone who  gets the-spiget thing in their head really loves it, he goes around the  house saying, ""I absolutely LOVE my (i forget what its called!).""  (It's a lot of funnier when Julia tells it).
Recently, my mom's really  good friend Stephanie had to have a tumor the size of a honeydew removed.  I told my mom to tell Stephanie to rent this movie, because it's a lesson  in how to use humor to get through life's most awful situations.  So if you  have a few dollars to spare, or just need some cheering up, make ""God  Said Ha!"" your next movie purchase.",957571200,46,1787,4.748366013071895
1040167,4,630549519X,"Los Angeles is a place to which people frequently move to escape their families, only to spend their creative waking moments writing confessional one-person plays about the families they escaped.  One might argue that the  author need no longer venture in the jungles of Borneo or sail near islands  with many-beaked birds to create a sense of adventure, as the intricate  weirdness of the family refugee's story now eclipses any of the arcane  knowledge one learns among exotic flora and fauna.  Hence, in recent times,  Angelenos have been ""treated"" to one woman shows about  dysfunctional yet immensely bland family vacations, the unfashionable toes  of former beaus, and other ""look at me, look at me"" trivia of the  life-made-stale-through-self-involved-art.  Talented writers have submerged  their talents in the unnerving quest to unearth their own souls through  confessionals that make one long for sitcoms.  It's rather like  life-as-cynical-pointless-two-hour-show, produced by NPR.
God Said Ha!  thus begins, for me, with the daunting task of mining a genre in which the  first mine shaft might better, as far as I am concerned, never have been  drilled.  Julia Sweeney, the Saturday Night Live veteran, not to mention  the fabled ""Pat"", tells us an annus horibilis story involving  family cancer, and having one's own family move in with one.  One might  imagine that such a deeply confessional, ""see my family, aren't we  weird and funny?"" piece would suffer from the same defects of would-be  conceptual performance art that have caused many others who know (or should  know) better to lose their way.
But things ain't that simple--this play  works.  Although Ms. Sweeney has converted her family into a sort of set  piece with the usual ""god aren't we funny and poignant"" devices,  one must admit that the story is almost always poignant and sometimes quite  funny.  God Said Ha! is a fine play, and converts into a fine film.  There's no effort to ""cinematize"" the play--it's a performance.  Julia Sweeney's performance is simple, unadorned, and, if she sometimes  asks us to smirk a bit about her mother, she also manages to deliver the  most wrenching lines with a sense of involved detachment better than any  trick of delivery.
This is a film worth seeing.  This is a film that  argues that the problem with the confessional one person play may not  always be the format--and that the right material can make for a good show.",938908800,13,2446,5.047738693467337

There was not a single dull moment.  Which seems odd, because with most comedians and films, you are waiting for the setup.  But Julia Sweeney is so engaging, I savored every second.

Heartbreaking, funny and even uplifting.",1418515200,,251,4.904761904761905

7890692,4,630549519X,"Most people are more aware of Julia Sweeney as an alumnus of ""Saturday Night Live"" rather than as an NPR contributor (""This American Life""). Sweeney has emerged as a smartly funny and engaging monologist during her NPR stint; quite a contrast to the goofy comic TV characters she is best known for. I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you're puzzled by the term ""monologist"", or you're expecting this to be a sequel to ""It's Pat!"", well--then you've probably never heard of Spaulding Gray! ""God Said Ha!"" is, in fact, quite reminiscent of Spaulding Gray's ""Gray's Anatomy""; both monologues are based on the trials and tribulations involved with serious illness, either your own or that of someone very close to you. Sweeney manages to keep the humor and the sentiment nicely balanced, so you'll find yourself ""laughing through the tears"", as they say. No car crashes or hot sex, but plenty of the comedy and drama of of our everyday lives!",969580800,6,941,4.779141104294479
