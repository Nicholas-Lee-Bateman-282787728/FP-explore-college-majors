8286526,5,B001CBW144,Monkey Time is energetic and colorful and continually keeps my daughter interested even after watching it many times. She likes to listen to it every night as she falls asleep. It's full of great easy-to-understand lessons that leave her singing and brushing her teeth.,1270252800,,269,5.136363636363637
8286527,5,B001CBW144,"My son was over at his grandparents one weekend with not much to do... as his toys and movies were back at home with mommy. While I had a great weekend home by myself (okay, working), my in-laws rented this movie for him. He watched it the entire weekend! They could not pull him away from the screen! The songs are silly and catchy. He was hopping and brushing his teeth! As soon as he came back, immediately Daddy just HAD to tell mommy what the next purchase of the house was to be and who it was for.

Perhaps one of the best investments of my life for when I need about a good half hour or so of ""me"" time; daddy can mow the lawn -- hey honey! See? I entitled it, DADDY WAS RIGHT! =) -- and with the little guy laughing and learning. Fully engaged, ooh oohing aah aahing and seeing/ hearing/ speaking/ jumping/ you name it!

Plus, what is great about actually purchasing it (at least, by the rental the grandparents could not tell) is that there are additional interactive activities for your PC when you put the disc into your hard drive. Even simple stuff like coloring sheets of the monkeys. How cute! I wish there were more movies like these. This should be a series of sorts!

BRAVO, JAMES CROSS, B-R-A-V-O !!! 5 STAAAAAS!!!!! *****",1255910400,,1242,4.344827586206897
8286528,5,B001CBW144,"I had a sick child at home and this was one of the only DVD's left in the RedBox. I was pleasantly surprised with it.

My two granddaughters loved it! The Monkey dance caught their imagination and they danced and sang along with it. The activities had them interested. And the alphabet section was fantastic. You are able to read about the letter to your child from the screen. Telling them the color, shapes, and the word it is spelling as well as that same word in Spanish.

This is a great DVD not only for entertainment value, but for learning! Highly recommend it.",1248220800,,569,4.461538461538462
8286529,5,B001CBW144,"I let my niece and nephew (ages 5 and 8)watch this during the weekend, and they really loved it!

The songs are catchy, and the characters are adorable.  My niece's favorite was the pink monkey.  :)",1234396800,,198,4.444444444444445
8286530,4,B001CBW144,"It's Monkey Time is a great DVD for the preschool set.  The colorful animation and infectious songs really caught my 5 yo's attention, and he even learned to tie his shoes after watching this a few times and learning the song.  I was also impressed by the voice acting in the DVD. Each monkey has a distinct personality, and the voicework really makes it come across. Recommended for age 6 and under.",1224720000,,400,4.541666666666667
