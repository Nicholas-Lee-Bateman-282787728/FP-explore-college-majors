5966335,5,B00F3M3ZC0,"Having finished the complete season, I feel comfortable writing this review. The best part of this series is the story and how the characters are woven into it. For this reason, I will keep this as spoiler free as I can.

Season 4 is, in my opinion, the best of the series. Elements from past seasons are effortlessly woven into the current plot line and made fresh again with the pleasant twist of a mysterious power mutating existing troubles in Haven. This seasons character arcs are its strongest point, with the new troubles forcing Audrey, Nathan, and especially Duke, out of their comfort zones, showing who they truly are and where their priorities lie.

A big plus about this season is the introduction of two new characters, Jennifer and William. A side note for all you SyFy fans, William is played by the always phenomenal Colin Ferguson, from Eureka fame. Though he still has that effortless charm, we get to see him in a role that is the antithesis of Jack Carter who is, for me, the highlight of this season.

 The seasons running arc is the best the show has had, and finally gets around to answering some questions we've had since the first episode of the series. The new characters never overshadow our old favorites because of their expertly handled character arcs. Season 4 is probably the most new viewer friendly season thanks to the great writing and strong character development. If you're a fan of the series, or Sci-Fi in general, season 4 of Haven is a no brainer. An absolute buy.",1387065600,82,1508,4.679245283018868

5966351,4,B00F3M3ZC0,"I love the series. However, it never seems to snow or get cold. I have never been to Maine, so perhaps the location next to the Atlantic keeps it warm. It is farther north than some parts of Canada, so I am just curious why the seasons never change. This is not like FARGO in North Dakota where it seems to be snowing all of the time, even when Uzi battles are taking place and throats are being cut.",1482192000,,400,4.075949367088608

It is in fact region A/1 and plays fine on US players.

5966357,3,B00F3M3ZC0,having trouble getting through this season. Going to give it a little bit of time and try again. Might just be from watching seasons one and two - which were great and three which was still good. This season seems to have 'jumped the shark' a bit. Will see about watching this over the winter. Might update the review then if I have something better to say,1474329600,,356,4.3283582089552235

5966382,5,B00F3M3ZC0,Always wanting more and so glad they made season 4.  So thrilled they did Season 5 too.  I love how Audrey is able to solve the troubles with Nathan and Duke.  I also love my old time fav WWE Edge Adam Copeland in this awesome role Dwight Hendrickson who joined them in Season 3 which made it even more thrilling as his trouble is being a bullet magnet as his trouble.  Glad he stayed on during this season.  He is keeps getting better better in each episode.  Great cast.,1450483200,,472,4.247191011235955

5966398,5,B00F3M3ZC0,"If you've seen seasons 1-3 you know Haven is about people with mystical powers  called ""The Troubles""(some good, most not), and those who try to help them.  When Season 3 ended it looked like all was lost for Duke and Audrey as they were sucked into the abyss called The Barn.  When Season 4 begins things have changed and a new set of problems for ""Haven"" is upon them, Duke and Audrey are misplaced and the magic of this series continues.

5966433,3,B00F3M3ZC0,"As the show progresses it seems to get weirder and weirder. This season introduces new characters. Dukes brother Wade, Jennifer who runs into Duke after hearing voices, and Colin Ferguson from Eureka as Audreys new handler. And they keep appearing. The show still centres around Lunenburg, Nova Scotia standing in for Haven Maine and the tourist bureau there is working on a map of Haven sites in town. This season the former professional wrestler who showed up last season gets elevated to police chief after Nathan falls into disrepute. Duke seems conflicted about being cast as an aid to law-enforcement. He and Nathan form a love triangle with Audrey. I was somewhat disappointed with this season since its still running one can ohly hope it picks up next year.

Our main characters enter new territory for each this season, but I don't believe in giving plots away so I'll stop there.  Let's just say after four seasons I'm still an avid fan and looking forward to the extended (26 episodes) fifth season.

(ok that's what I've wanted to know, but still not sure about the Colorado Kid but I can wait.) Honestly I've yet to see a season yet that I don't like. This one in some ways takes the series further and let them open it up to some different possibilities.",1415232000,,339,4.396825396825397

5966465,3,B00F3M3ZC0,"Wow.  We knew a change was coming, but this?  I mostly like the new girl.  As intended, I mostly dislike the new guy.  The troubles have really changed and there is no order or reason in Haven any more.  I don't really like the change in the feel of the town or the characters, but I have loved the show so much until now, I will stick with it and hope for the best.  Pretty disappointed with the end of the last episode.  Hope that is resolved in the next season.  Really missing that cozy-but-odd Haven feel.",1412553600,8,510,4.185567010309279

5966484,5,B00F3M3ZC0,"At the end of the last season, Audrey and Duke disappeared into a blip that was ""the barn."" Fast forward a few months and quite a few things in Haven have changed.

To start, there is a new sheriff in town and Nathan has fled to hide from the hate. Locals are none too happy with how he ended things. Troubles are changing and developing unusually. Well, unusual for Haven.

This is the best season thus far! Everything is different. It is full of questions, some answers and a few mysteries revealed.",1397692800,11,501,4.434782608695652
5966485,5,B00F3M3ZC0,"This is by far one of the best sci/fi shows on television.  This season was a complete nail biter.  Every episode did not disappoint.  This show has a very talented cast.  The show is incredibly written.  The show is shot in a beautiful location (Nova Scotia).  This show has something for everyone sci/fi, plot twists, romance, suspense, comedy (thanks Eric Balfour), and edge of your seat plots.  Do yourself a favor and get into this show.  If you not, start at the beginning and watch all the way through.  By then, Season 4 will be on DVD and then you are ready for the Fall when Season 5 starts on SYFY.  I wasn't a sci/fi fan but this show got me hooked.",1392940800,22,661,4.344262295081967
