1677595,5,B00005YUQG,"I ordered this for my mystery-loving wife, and we both love it. The stories are interesting, not too involved, but neither are they too simple, and takes place in the years immediately after WWI. But what really makes the series are the characters. Tommy and Tuppence are an attractive, stylish (for the period), wonderful, wholesome, and fun-loving couple. The acting is terrific, and the scripts follow the original books closely. I promise that you will love these as much as we do!",1205107200,2,485,4.926829268292683
1677596,5,B00005YUQG,"The comedy/myteries are set in post WWI Britain, with wonderful period sets and costumes.  Francesca and James create interesting and believeable characters with a light touch.  The mystery runs the gamut from serious to hilarious.  Enjoy!",1196553600,2,239,5.583333333333333
1677597,4,B00005YUQG,I remember watching this series originally on PBS and enjoying it very much.  I enjoyed very much watching it again.  The chemistry between Tommy and Tuppence and their interplay is very entertaining.  The Dame wrote this seried in a much more light-hearted vein than her usual books and the dramatization carries that humor through.  The mysteries are a bit shallow but it's fun to watch these two amatuer turned professional detectives.,1153353600,17,438,5.126760563380282
1677598,3,B00005YUQG,"The married couple solve crimes by blundering onto the solutions. You should be able to get the solution to several of them within one minute of hearing the initial clues.

Once that is understood, the acting and sets are first rate.  If you are into cultural anthropology, you will like the series.  If you are into crime detection, you will be disappointed.",1143158400,3,359,4.758064516129032
1677599,4,B00005YUQG,"Thank goodness for Acorn Media, which has given us the Wimsey mysteries on tapes and DVD, the longer Poirots on DVD and the shorter ones on tape. With the arrival of ""Partners in Crime"" (AMP 5017), there lacks only the 12th boxed set of Poirots to more or less complete the Christie cycle as it exists on this label. (It is A&E who has begun to issue the Marple mysteries on DVD and a few of the more recent Poirots.)
 The best thing about this ""Tommy & Tuppence: Partners in Crime"" series is the outrageous costumes Francesca Annis gets to wear, the most spectacular appearing in the last episode in this boxed set. Now this is featherlight Agatha Christie, so do not expect the complex kind of case that Wimsey always--and Poirot often--has to solve. The inside joke of the T&T novels is that in each one they emulate the techniques of a famous fictional detective. For example, in one episode Tommy (James Warwick) is dressed as Father Brown and the last mystery is described by the team as a real Edgar Wallace case.
 ""The Case of the Missing Lady"" is probably the silliest of them all, and even Tuppence is required to do a comic turn that is frankly embarrassing. ""The Unbreakable Alibi"" has a solution that is utterly predictable, while the same could be said about the culprit in ""The Man in the Mist."" ""The Crackler"" is probably the most satisfactory.
 All in all, good lightweight fun, but few thrills. And the Annis character can get a little ""too too"" now and then and start to grate in a way that she does not in the novels.
Unlike the Poirot tapes, these hold two episodes each. They easily could have gotten three onto each tape, but the people at ABC overseas seem to be able to dictate how the American distributors must package their material. So do not blame Acorn Media for that.",1016928000,36,1799,4.529230769230769

1677663,1,B00005YUQG,"Low rating because the description ""set 2"" implies a continuation of set 1 but it isn't.  I now have 2 sets of Partners in Crime,  same episodes.",1410739200,,145,4.333333333333333

1677665,5,B00005YUQG,great,1404691200,,5,5.0
1677666,5,B00005YUQG,But I do enjoy Tommy and Tuppence tho as I've said before the silliness of the difference between men and women gets to me. You will go to bed with no left over tension or fear so these are very relaxing. The costumes are wonderful. What fun she must have had wearing them. And the acting is great. Very enjoyable.,1400544000,2,314,4.25
1677667,3,B00005YUQG,"I love Agatha Christie, this is good but not high on my list.  If you are a Christie fan you should still like it...",1386460800,,116,3.8333333333333335
1677668,1,B00005YUQG,"Buyer warning:  This dvd ""set 2"" is merely a subset of what is already available for much less!  Acorn Media produces this set of 6 episodes.  But all 11 episodes of the series are already available from Acorn Media, for much less money than this subset!  Why anyone would want to buy this 6-episode set, for much more money than the 11-episode set, is one mystery I can't solve.  I bought this and the fuller set by mistake--because there is no list provided of what episodes are on each set.  If the episodes were listed, people could see:  ""Oh, this set 2 is just 6 of the same episodes that are on the other, cheaper set!""
  As a meager plus, this ""set 2"" does have cast filmographies, an ""Agatha Christie biography"" and ""interactive trivia.""  I'd rather that Amazon had listed the episodes, so I wouldn't have wasted over $20 buying this.  Buyer beware on this item.",1385942400,23,871,4.519230769230769
1677669,1,B00005YUQG,This video is not a regular movie....it's more like video taping of a play on stage...  I wouldn't recommend  it.,1385164800,,113,4.6
1677670,5,B00005YUQG,I appreciate your bending over backward to correct a small problem in getting this product to me.  YOU were GREAT.  I would be glad to buy from you at any time.  Keep up the good work.,1370217600,,184,4.055555555555555
1677671,4,B00005YUQG,"I liked this dvd collection but wish that set 1 had been offered with this set.  The dvd collection was wonderful but without set 1, a first timer wouldn't know how the couple met, etc.  The mysteries were outstanding but needed to be presented as one collection with all mysteries of sets 1 and 2.  A great collection of mysteries.",1368230400,,332,4.5

1677713,3,B00005YUQG,"This is entertaining, light fare.  The two discs include: The Sunningdale Mystery, The Ambassador's Boots, The Man in the Mist, The Case of the Missing Lady, The Unbreakable Alibi, The Crackler.",1347926400,2,194,5.258064516129032
1677714,4,B00005YUQG,"This series is up to expected quality, although not Agatha's best plots they are a lot of fun, and very watchable.",1330214400,,114,4.476190476190476
1677715,5,B00005YUQG,"I checked this series out of my local public library and enjoyed it very much.  As an American I have to admit, the accents were hard to follow at first.  Especially without subtitles, but I got used to it after a while.  This series features a married couple who have an private investigators agency.  It is set during the roaring twenties and the plots almost always have a twist to them that does get one to thinking.  They seem to solve the mysteries through logic a lot of the time and sometimes the viewer isn't privy to all the information until the end that leads them to the conclusion.  However, the chemistry between Tommy and Tuppence is a likeable one.  And the actor portraying Tommy has an air of Gregory Peck, while Tuppence has an air of the post Gone With The Wind Vivien Leigh. All in all, it is very enjoyable.  Only rarely is there a mild swear word.",1329868800,,871,4.4
1677716,5,B00005YUQG,"I love Tommy and Tuppence. Even if some of the stories are dumb, what of it? I am just grateful that someone made the stories into lovely movies. Beautiful family entertaining without people holding their privates, cursing or blatant violence.",1318377600,,243,5.1
1677717,4,B00005YUQG,"Clean, sophisticated British comedy.  Set in the 1920's. Francesca Annis and James Warwick make a great team of private investigators.  Based on stories by Agatha Christie, but without the convoluted plot twists.",1310947200,,212,5.59375
1677718,5,B00005YUQG,"The Tommy and Tuppence mystery series is quite intriguing to say the least.
 It takes place in Britain around the nineteen twenties or thirties.
Having read all of Christie's mystery books, this one stood
out as being a little lighter, with a hint of humor around each corner.
What pleased me the most, were the costumes
 Tuppence wore during each story.
They were fabulous. Where can I buy her hats?
 The actress Francesca Annis,is a perfect match for this sassy character.
As well as James Warwick was for Tommy.
What fun to watch the duo get themselves in trouble
 without even meaning to do so at all.
The banter between the duo is such fun too.
It is a battle for one- upmanship in each story.
Who can solve the mystery first?
We enjoyed this DVD.
What a  good break from our world of high tech investigations.
This mystery has a little bit of everything to keep one interested.
Romance,high fashion, and of course a murder or two.
I highly recommend this DVD series.",1307059200,5,972,4.563218390804598
1677719,5,B00005YUQG,Nice to have this (and with Set 1 also !).  Packaged solid --- no damage.,1286409600,,73,3.8666666666666667
1677720,4,B00005YUQG,"The quility and sound are first rate.. I bought these Videos, as I could no longer find them on cable. They must take place in the 1920's. Because of the style of clothing.  Tuppence's hats are just too much....This is a light fun type of Mystery. Nothing to make you cry or bite your nails... About on the order of Hercule Poirot. For all of you who are fans of this type of Christie mystery,
I recommended it..",1273104000,,412,4.282051282051282
1677721,5,B00005YUQG,I enjoy a good murder mystery. These are particulary interesting because they pre-date Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot. The banter between the two main characters is good. These hour shows are perfect at lunch using my new portable DVD player.,1217894400,2,242,5.075
7957216,5,B00005YUQG,"Agatha Christie's ""The House of Lurking death"" adapted by Jonathan Hales.

Mary Chilcott (Louisa Rix) receives a box of chocolates. She naturedly shares them with others to find that the chocolates were lased with poison. Not enough to kill but to make everyone sick. Being private and figuring that the anonymous came from someone in that very house, contacts Tommy Beresford (James Warwick) and Tuppence (Francesca Annis) of the international detective agency.

Naturally as with their first two episodes or movies Tommy and Tuppence are both wise beyond their time and do some of the dumbest things that lead them to the solution of the problem. Will they be there in time to save Mary or if not will they be able to figure out who and how it was done. More important why.

As with most of the Partners in Crime series we are fare ahead of them on the whom. The fun is to watch them figure out not only the whom but the other details. This story is a period piece of just after The Great War.

Made for TV and fairly transparent, this film still has all the ambiance of a BBC Agatha Christy production. It is a period piece and employs many major English actors. Detective Inspector Marriott (Arthur Cox) played the newspaper reporter Salcombe Hardy in Dorothy L. Sayers' Have His Carcase (1987).",1504915200,,1299,4.6593886462882095
7957217,3,B00005YUQG,"I'm a huge admirer of the original Tommy&Tuppence shows with Annis and the ""Tommy"" (Warwick?) actor... Imagine my disappointment when I turned, just now, to what was supposed to be the FIRST of their wonderful tales of adventure, and it wasn't there! Searched thru disc 1 and 2; it wasn't there... Pitiful!  So if you, like me, crave to start with ""The Secret Adversary"" again, before viewing the next tales, don't buy or borrow this set. I shall be going on a search for ""The Secret Adversary"" in libraries... As someone(s) else has pointed out here, one needs to see how T&T got together to slide into their detective work... You need to see the chemistry of two young people, meeting after a war (WW I) and picking up the pieces (albeit with a decidedly light hearted air) and moving on into adventure and love, and into connections with other interesting characters whom they befriend and help...  or even hire...  First things first, please!!!!!!!",1485907200,,952,4.7926829268292686

7957223,3,B00005YUQG,"Typically British for the time when it was produced - kinda slow and borderline boring.  But, it has its charm and it's a joy seeing Francesca Annis!  She portrays a very different kind of character than the one she did in Dune, but is still a picture of true beauty and charm.",1430784000,,277,4.3076923076923075
