2174156,5,B000679MFG,"i feel that Sex and the single mom was a opening film to relationshops. The bond between the mom and daughter was... fascinateing, But at points in watching I thought that they were lovers not mother and daughter. The film really spoke to me and gave me quite a lot to think about.",1134259200,4,281,4.320754716981132
2174157,1,B000679MFG,"In this movie, Gail O'Grady's character, [Jessica Gradwell] is a paralegal, and a single, divorced mother who just can't seem to do certain things right, like keeping her nose out of her 15-year-old daughter, Sara's business. For example, peeking through Sara's private photos, and her relationships with boys. Sara (Danielle Panabaker), an aspiring photographer is annoyed by her mother's faults, bitchiness and nosiness. She becomes more furious when she finds out her mother, who always denied having a ""boyfriend"" had a [six week fling] with a phony character named [Alex Lofton] (Grant Show), a [heart surgeon] involved in a malpractice suit whom Jessica was interviewing at her employ. He was also married with kids, but said that he was getting a divorce (which might have been a lie). They deliberately started a relationship, and deliberately had sex. Then after a while, Alex said he was [going back to his kids, and left]. Then Jessica found out [she was pregnant], and at first denied it to Sara when Sara found a [pregnancy test kit] in the trash. When Jessica finally fessed up, and said she was [going to have, and keep the baby], Sara lashed out. She had every right to after being lied to, and lectured about sex. She left the house, and stayed with her father, Nick for a while, but eventually she and Jessica reconcilled their differences. Still, Jessica foolishly [had the baby] (a boy unfortunately). She later decided to go to law school. She should've also realized about all the misery she had caused, and faced the facts of her consequences.
This is a movie about habitual liars who get away with sexual affairs.",1129420800,11,1637,4.913357400722021
2174158,4,B000679MFG,"Usually, in stories like this, a teenage girl gets careless, becomes pregnant, and has to hide it from her mother. But here, it's the mother who gets careless, becomes pregnant, and has to hide it from her daughter! The aforementioned (single) mother has been discouraging her teenage daughter from becoming sexually active, while carrying on a wild, secret affair with a married man. When she becomes pregnant and her lover abandons her, she has to face her own hypocrisy. This film is a cut above most made-for-Lifetime-TV movies, thanks largely to Gail O'Grady's performance as the mother - she's always luminous and likable, even when some might question her behavior. Credit must also go to Danielle Panabaker as the daughter.",1107475200,38,731,5.1

2174171,4,B000679MFG,"I just watched the movie - sex and the single mom. Some good life lessons in the storyline.  I want some help with part of a song that is played during a romantic scene between the two main characters. It's about 35 minutes into the movie and plays for about 35-40 seconds. There is no listing in the credits apart from the person who wrote the music. Can anyone help me find this music, what it's called and who sings it. It's very haunting. Thanks Monika",1396915200,4,456,4.3023255813953485
2174172,4,B000679MFG,"Like mother, like daughter? When it comes to romance, single mom Jess Gradwell and her 15-year-old daughter Sara may have a lot more in common than they think. Intrigued by a hunky heart surgeon, Jess falls hard into a possibly unwise affair.

At the same time, Sara is discovering her own longings and perhaps acting unwisely about a boy at school. Emotions are on edge in the Gradwell household. Jess and Sara clash over sexuality and morality. Then Jess makes a decision that will change both of them forever.",1390521600,,512,4.752808988764045

2174188,3,B000679MFG,"I personally don't understand why you people are trashing this movie. It was very well written, and if any of you had actually seen it, you would see that she was trying to keep her daughter from making the same mistake that she did that way she wouldnt have to suffer the same heart aches and breaks. She was still her mother no matter what, just because she messed up once, does not give her daughter the right to be promiscuous. I agree with that. Those of you that have trashed this film, should have looked at the title more carefully. Hello! what were you expecting?",1161043200,2,572,4.40566037735849
