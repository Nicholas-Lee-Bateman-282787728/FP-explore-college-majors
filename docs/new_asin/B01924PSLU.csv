7560939,5,B01924PSLU,"If this Blu-Ray is anything like the game, it'll be something you'll watch many times a year, especially during the long off season when you're hungry for football.  This Blu-Ray gets 5 stars just because it features the #HTownTakeover's very own University of Houston Cougars.  This beat down of Florida State will replace my old worn out VHS of the Garden State Bowl as the most watched Cougar bowl game of all time about a week after receiving.

From the coin toss, to the kickoff, to Demarcus Ayers' TD pass to Chance Allen, to the incredible Cougar D (5 turnovers), to Greg Ward running wild, to Kyle Postma coming in to ice the game with the last TD drive, to the last time Whomp Whomp was played...you'll love the Peach Bowl Experience all over again.  This Peach Bowl victory brings the ""BOOM"" as ERob would say!

This punch in Florida State's mouth should be required viewing for all the Big 12 presidents that are living in denial about losing the Houston market (looking at you, Texas).  Houston is worthy of a spot in the Big 12 and if the Big 12 hesitates, it's only a matter of time before one of its competitors invites the Houston Cougars.

You'll love the spirt the Cougars show as they beat the 2013 National Champion Florida State Seminoles, it's a reflection of the can do attitude that built the city of Houston as well as the university that's named after it.  A Tier One university deserves Tier One athletics and the 2015 Houston Cougar Football Team delivered.  The population of Texas is projected to grow exponentially and the state of Texas needs a strong, well rounded Tier One University of Houston that's a member of a P5 league to keep more of our bright and talented young men and women at home in Texas for their college education and experience.  There's no need to go out of state when your city is calling.

This is the University of Houston's time and you owe it to yourself to buy this Blu-Ray and let the Cougars' greatness rub off on you.  I'm going to sleep with it under my pillow because it's how the #RealFiddy rolls!  This Blu-Ray is the perfect compliment to my special edition ""Peach Bowl #DRANK"" and Patty's Famous 7 Layer Dip.  Patty says she'll make those sugar cookies I love with those Cougar Red sprinkles too!

I've even bought an extra copy to leave in the new media room I've added to my Cougar memorabilia bathroom and plan to buy several cases so I can give these discs as birthday, wedding, anniversary, and Christmas gifts. I'll also keep a copy in my 'Slade so we can watch the Cougars' Peach Bowl victory on the headrests.

Times are tough in Austin, so buy copies for your Longhorn friends so they can experience a bowl victory.  Don't forget your Aggie friends as they need to experience that winning feeling as you explain what a conference championship is while pointing out the concept of New Years Six bowls.  Even our Texas Tech friends could use a #ShastaBlast.

What's next for the Cougars? A top 25 recruiting class, followed by another outstanding season in 2016 as Tom Herman builds something special, something that Houstonians and Texans will continue to be proud of.  So stoke your #FITB and jump on the #HTownTakeover bandwagon.  You'll be glad you did.

8743523,1,B01924PSLU,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. The Blu-Ray disc isn't recognized by any player I own. Unfortunately, I waited beyond Amazon's return windows to open and watch the disk.  I am not the only person reporting this issue, so it's not a problem with my players.

And, adding insult to injury, I attempted to upgrade the firmware on my LG BluRay player in an attempt to get it to play this disc, and the firmware update bricked the player. So not only did I get ripped on this purchase, it led to the destruction of my LG player.",1476403200,,531,4.247524752475248
8743524,5,B01924PSLU,The product is simple and was delivered in a timely manor. The Video menu was simple not too many extras but good game.,1472774400,,119,4.217391304347826
8743525,1,B01924PSLU,"The Blu-ray and DVD disks are data disks and not movie disks. My Blu-ray will not play either and indicates that the DVD is only a data disk which my DVD player will not play. I saved them to play tonight and was extremely disappointed. I checked both devices and the problem was not with them. Amazon could care less. I am a UH alumnus and am very angry.

UPDATE: 09/2016  I purchased a new LG Blu-ray player made in July 2016. The DVD plays fine but the Blu-ray is still not recognized. I also purchased an LG external Blu-ray player. It would not play the Blu-ray smoothly. After trying several free Blu-ray programs, I discovered VSO Media Player. When I attempted to play it, all I got was black screen. They have a FAQ page. I looked on it and they stated the problem. They suggested using DVDFAB Passkey. The problem was the AAC protection on the Blu-ray. After installation, Passkey temporarily removes the protection and the Blu-ray plays on my computer using VSO and Passkey. This is legal because the disk is licensed for home use when purchased. I emailed the manufacturer, WAZEE Digital, to complain about the fraud in selling Blu-ray disks which will not play on most players. To date there has been no response. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BLU-RAY AND DVD DISKS UPON RECEIPT FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THEY PLAY. Amazon allows a 30 day window for returns.",1472256000,,1376,4.5894308943089435
