Bill Williamson once again comes out of hiding after two years to deal with what he calls cleaning the world and exposing the corruptness of the world and spread his message to the masses. Great movie and the ending doesn't disappoint either. His character has a backup plan for every scenario. Many of the things his character says throughout the movie speaks truth.

6455986,4,B00L0MICRU,"When Rampage came out in 2009, Uwe Boll created a sensation with Bill Williamson, the anti-hero, played competently by Brendan Fletcher. I feel that the film was a successful statement on what leads a person to change things around him. We cannot be judgmental about Bolls statement. It is about the deep rooted sickness in the way people are raised in USA. It has to do with the inhuman attraction to money and greed and our obsession with it. After a slick ending that leaves room for a sharp sequel, we are served Capital Punishment. This sequel, made in 2014, unsettles you as it does not take a pleasant route. It is about holding a television station and its anchors and workers captive. The best part of the movie concerns the disc that is aired along with the interview of Bill Williamson. It sends out a sharp message of how a democratic society is nothing but a game controlled by the rich and the elite with the politicians being mere puppets in their hands. I love it when Boll includes censorship, invasion of privacy and religion in that message. Williamson wants to change the world around him by going after the peace of mind of the rich class as his focused platform. Boll is right on the money when he sends out a hint on how the prevailing system could be destroyed, even if it comes to mindless killing and non-justifiable acts of violence. This series is nothing short of controversial. We can look forward to the third edition in good time. The film has excellent direction by Uwe Boll and inspired music by Jessica de Rooij.",1455667200,3,1547,4.588447653429603

6455990,1,B00L0MICRU,"Another piece of thoroughly inept would-be agitprop by Uwe Boll, possibly the worst filmmaker alive who still somehow gets to make movies with professional actors and slick production values.  My only explanation for how this guy gets to keep making movies is that a) he made a deal with the devil; b) he's independently wealthy and self-finances this garbage; c) someone with a lot of money really hates us or d) people who finance movies have no idea what they are doing.  Uwe Boll shouldn't be making movies--he should be rotting in jail for crimes against humanity.

This sequel to 2009's far superior (I can't believe I'm using those words) Rampage finds the self-important, mass murdering psycho of the first film back, this time taking people at a television station hostage to air his Wikipedia-inspired manifesto and help the world wake up to what a screwed up place it is that we all live in.  The problem is that the messenger of the film is a psycho (at one point he murders a hostage because she does yoga to prove that yoga won't protect you from bullets--although I'm pretty certain that's not why people actually do yoga) and Uwe Boll seems to think that his lead character is some sort of a tragic hero rather than a vicious, narcissistic nut job.

Rampage: Capital Punishment is torture to sit through--at least the original Rampage had some decent action to offset the bad writing and Assault on Wall Street had an undeniably appealing concept for Boll to screw up but Rampage: Capital Punishment is just flat out, worthless garbage with nothing to redeem it--this movie is every bit as narcissistic and brain-dead as its psychotic lead character.  The fact that Uwe Boll thinks he is sending an important  political message with this movie is undeniable--he's the drunk loudmouth in a bar that somehow he has the money and resources to turn his angry rants and infantile fantasies of violence into an actual movie, albeit a torturous, virtually unwatchable one.

The thing that's really unfortunate is that the world could really use some good anti-rich agitprop that rips the wealthy and privileged to shreds and exposes the hypocrisy inherent in both capitalism and democracy--but Uwe Boll doesn't have the smarts or skill to make that type of movie.  Unfortunately, he does possess the money and determination to try--Rampage 3 is currently in pre-production.",1444089600,,2382,4.935

6455995,1,B00L0MICRU,"Overview...A liberal is pissed off at the government and thinks the only way to fix it is to kill people who have more money than you.  Unlike the cover suggests, it does not take place in D.C., but rather a random news station.  The acting was subpar and the message was even worse.  By the end of the film you were left exhausted having listened to a nut case complain about EVERYTHING.  At one point he even gives a gun to a little girl and tells her to go home and kill her parents and then herself...lovely.  His ""facts"" about gun control are completely false which makes you question the amount of truth in anything else he says.  It was just one terrible monologue after the other with a few screen splices of politicians to distract you from the bad acting.  Don't be fooled by the cover, there is way more talking and whining than action...I'd say the ratio is 30%  action, and 70% complaining and lying from a commie nutbag.",1424217600,,934,4.421052631578948

6455997,3,B00L0MICRU,"Rampage: Capital Punishment is the sequel to the first movie entitled Rampage. This movie revolves around a young man discontented with politics, government, and the world around him and goes on a non-stop killing spree to make his voice heard. Bill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher)  eventually takes over a television station along with hostages that include a popular news anchor in order to get his message out. Bill Williamson's motives become more clear as he begins to reveal his anti-government far left views and espouses communist ideals, even quoting Karl Marx. Bill Williamson also reminds his hostages that the lack of gun control enabled him to do all this. Bill Williamson's diatribe's include vintage class warfare arguments and atheism. Bill Williamson has absolute disdain for what he views as the wealthy and corporate America. This film contains very disturbing scenes of gratuitous graphic violence and bloodshed.",1421539200,,930,5.413793103448276
6455998,5,B00L0MICRU,"I really don't have much of a problem with director Uwe Boll and found the original Rampage to be a really smart thriller with some strong messages in it, Rampage 2 picks up a year later and Bill Williamson re-surfaces to continue his reign of terror, now with a massive following of fans online who agree with his strong views on politics, consumerism and reality TV etc, Williamson takes hostages in a TV station and sends his final message out to the people telling them what they must do, even though this sequel still has its moments of violence and bloody shootouts it has a little less than the original, the movie is more dialogue this time which is not a bad thing as you can actually relate to allot of things said in this movie as we listen to Bill preaching to his followers, Brendan Fletcher really pushes himself more this time and really shows what a fine actor he is as he practically saves the movie and makes it all worth watching, I don't know what it is but I love these movies, like the original it has a clever twist so im sure we will see Bill Williamson return to reek more havoc!!

It is more mindless killing, but somewhere in all that killing are a lot of interesting messages. Bill makes several good points about the world we live in, and how we only see society through a filter. It is almost Matrix like, the real world is hidden, even thought it is right in front of us. The movie makes you wonder if people like Edward Snowden are really the villains, or are they the heroes.

A part 3 has been announced, and with a bigger budget, has the potential to be a really good movie and finale to the series. If you want to contribute, Uwe Boll has an indiegogo campaign to help finance the movie.",1419206400,,746,4.180555555555555
6456001,4,B00L0MICRU,"A lot of people knock director Uwe Boll, but the fact is that he is highly capable of making a good and entertaining film. This is a sequel to Boll's 2009's RAMPAGE, an excellent action bloodfest about a disenfranchised teen (Brendan Fletcher), who dons homemade body armor and shoots up the entire town he lives in, killing everyone in sight and taking the time to rob the local bank. he gets away with it all because he is not just disenfranchised, he is also smart as hell and frames someone else for the deed (his face was covered by a bulletproof mask). This sequel finds Fletcher going to Washington, D.C.and basically doing the same thing, but this time he speaks for all the people who are sick and tired of the government taking advantage of us. Fletcher still shoots plenty of people and still dons homemade body armor, but I'm not going to tell you how it ends. Like I sai in the beginning, Uwe Boll seems to have more than his share of detractors, but they must have not watched his films 1968: TUNNEL RATS; ATTACK ON WALL STREET; FAR CRY; ATTACK ON DARFUR and this film and the original. If they did, they would be changing their opinion, but they would rather concentrate on his bombs like BLUBBERELLA and POSTAL. As long as Boll stays serious and keeps away from humor, he is highly effective.",1415404800,,1308,4.523206751054852

6456003,5,B00L0MICRU,"Do yourself a favor and watch the first one, ""Rampage"", before you comment on this one.

They do spend the first 15 - 20 minutes or so reviewing some highlights in the original, but you don't get the full story. I didn't believe there would ever be a sequel, and snatched this up the moment I saw it was out. A bit too political for my taste, I still had to give it 5 instead of 4 due to his snappy, clever, sarcastic, and arrogant remarks that were a highly entertaining contrast to his more quiet and reserved demeanor in the first one. The cocky personality was there, just not as over the top in your face as in Capital Punishment.

The original Rampage was essentially a step by step guide on how to successfully plan and execute a mass murder killing spree, and disappear with loads of cash while misdirecting initial investigators to believe the suspect burned the money and committed suicide, with all receipts and paper trails leading to the dead fall guy as the culprit. I am amazed that the morons out there who commit these types of crimes haven't picked up on how detailed and accurate the film depicts how a professional would prep for  and execute the event.

The nut job in the Aurora CO movie theater killings was reported to have 12 dead 70 wounded, before giving himself over to authorities on scene. Had a serious effort been made by a trained and motivated killer with the same equipment and opportunity, it would have been 70 dead and 12 wounded.

Capital Punishment was an entertaining thriller that focused more on the political message being broadcast to the public, with little attention to the details needed to pull it off successfully. Had these films been promoted properly, and exposed to more viewers, they would have attracted more attention from government agencies and watch groups, possibly even incorporated into regular training for officers on identifying suspicious behavior and red flags that signal potential threats before they occur.

Overall for a jaw dropping and realistic insight into a dedicated mass killers thinking, planning, prepping, and proceeding with a spree, watch Rampage.  To see what he could possibly do to take his agenda to the next level, Capital Punishment will entertain, while giving an insight into the political views of an extremist's radical mind set. They did the unthinkable, a sequel to Rampage. Now they have opened the door for several more in this series. Don't take them seriously or personal, just be aware that an intelligent kid can use these films as a template to assist him in in the design of his own personal spree..",1414281600,,2603,4.783964365256125
6456004,5,B00L0MICRU,"Being a huge fan of the first Rampage, this brings it to a new level and different tone that the first. I was thoroughly shocked when I saw a sequel and really excited for the next vision it had.  While the first captured suburban quiet desperation and opinions morphed into small-town killing spree, this is brought to a more political level and social commentary. Bill's transformation is quite clear as well. You can see his belief system is the structure to how he justifies and orchestrates the unfolding events, and also how his infamy has brought his ego to an inflated sense of heroism. His cruelty and impulses to him are more personified outrage for the seemingly intrinsic vapid nature of America. Brendan Fletcher does a great job, a mix of torment, black comedy, control, power, rage and sorrow. I hope we see a third edition!!",1412985600,,840,4.7534246575342465
6456005,4,B00L0MICRU,"In the first movie, it seems as if Bill gets away with the absolute perfect crime: the rampage. In the beginning of the sequel, the movie insinuates that the police have been looking for Bill ever since. As another viewer suggested, we are essentially told to forget that Bill got away; however, when thinking logically, one could assume that after the police further investigated the previous crime, Bill is the one who actually conducted those crimes.

However, as this movie progresses, we must continue to suspend our belief. Are we really supposed to think that someone who is as active on social media cannot be tracked in the modern age. Bill posts videos, has a Facebook, insinuates that he has a Twitter, and yet, the government who has apparently been tracking him for an entire year could not track him down? It's a movie, but my belief should not need to be suspended on something non-abstract as this.

In addition, referring to Bill's fans as ""followers"" made me think about the show The Following. Now, none of his followers performed any events in Bill's name throughout this movie, but the ending involving giving the little girl a gun made me think we will be seeing a third movie involving Bill and his followers. If you've seen The Following, you can definitely draw many comparisons throughout this film.

Also, some of Bill's political remarks can be a bit cringeworthy. For the most part, his remarks were crafted well and made believable. But as soon as he began blatantly supporting gun control and mentioning statistics, it was easy to see the writers pushing their agenda. Don't get me wrong, my political beliefs are essentially in line with Bill's, but it was simply unbelievable and horrible writing - nothing wrong with the acting. Brendan seriously made the best of a bad situation and made it at least bearable.

This movie still garners four stars from me because of my love for mass shooting films, the first installment of this film, and the beginning and ending of the movie. However, my only hope is that if a third installment is made, hopefully they do not go the route of obviously pushing an agenda.",1412812800,,2141,4.794037940379404

6456007,1,B00L0MICRU,"the first Rampage movie was by no means a good film. But it was entirely watchable as 80% mayhem and 20% story. This movie flips the numbers and it's mostly story. Which is a bad thing.

It's not an interesting enough movie to be so focused on story and trying to ""send a message."" It's just monologue after monologue with stock footage of world leaders and such spliced in. I guess just so there's something to look at on the screen while Bill is rambling on and on about the same stuff throughout the entire movie.

The worst part about this movie was Uwe Boll putting himself into the film despite not being an actor, and it shows. While Bill is going on one of his monologues about how The Man is bringing us down there's a shot that cuts to Boll watching and his character goes on with ""hey. This guy is right."" So what he's pretty much saying is that ""hey, the message that I, the creator of the movie is totally great, everybody.""

Again. The first Rampage, not good. But very watchable. This one is a stinker that can be missed. I'd be ok with the movie being story driven if the story was any good and not just repeating its same stale message throughout the entire film.",1412380800,,1180,4.330316742081448
6456008,4,B00L0MICRU,"Scary ideas. First, the idea that someone might think that killing a percentage of the population to wake the rest up to his version of the truth is a good tradeoff. Second, that many of the things he says about the Rich in America have some validity to them, although I might throw Lessig in there as a quotable source if his latest TED talk goes viral. Third, that this might be a role model for some of the disenfranchised who agree with everything in this movie.

That said, the movie is sometimes kinda wanky but the advantage of having crazy people telling truths is that they don't need to be true all the time. For example, he seemingly advocates gun control and yet proscribes a violent 'cleanse' as the cure for our world...using sticks and stones then? Like I said, crazy. Or maybe not as deprogrammed as he thought he was...he was also into national health care...In fact, when you think about it, Kill the Rich, Gun Control, and National Health Care, maybe he was a Lefty not a Righty? Unless you (ignore history and) equate all violence with the Right (as some do).  That must be why some people called him an extreme Rightist. Programming.

In the end, if you were politically active then this movie is a much better alternative to getting out those messages, which seem to be coming to fruition these days, than doing what the guy in the movie did. If you are sitting in your room thinking that he was right, make a movie instead, killing people until the survivors 'wake up' to your point of view doesn't put you in the category of heroes. More like in the category of villains like Stalin, Hitler, and Mao.

I haven't seen the first one yet so I can't comment on that. References to it make it sound non-political so I doubt I'll bother. Mass murder, guts and gore, killing for the sake of killing...not my cup of tea. This one was only interesting because of the storyline.",1411862400,2,1892,4.50728862973761
6456009,1,B00L0MICRU,"I really wanted to like this movie because the first one I really enjoyed. However this movie was horrible. Story and plot was over the top. The acting was what you would expect from a Uwe Boll film. Uwe himself even made an appearance in the film. I found myself laughing at certain parts that weren't even meant to be funny.
  Now the million dollar question. How does Bill blame guns for the killings in America? I mean are you serious? Haha Bills character is obviously mentally unstable and his weapons are illegally obtained so how can he blame lax gun control. By the way I am 100% pro gun. This ideology of this moron made me want to take this movie to the range and just riddle it. I guess Uwe Boll blames guns for killings and not his violent movies.",1411344000,2,760,4.345070422535211

6456012,3,B00L0MICRU,"This is another Uwe Boll film which always promises plenty of blood shed and a political message. In this production Bill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher) goes on a well planned  killing spree and holds a news station hostage in order to get out his message.

Bill is a psychopath who has been influenced by the far right, far left and anarchist dogma. His heroes are Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Karl Marx. The movie is all about the message. Bill is upset that the rich have wealth and power and no one is killing them...hence the duo meaning of ""Capital Punishment.""  Bill has a mixed message of government controlling our lives, i.e ""the illusion of freedom"", yet in the US there is no gun control or no universal health care system, i.e. government controls. Obama is guilty of violating the principles of the Magna Carta and he should have prosecuted the Bush administration for war crimes.  He justifies killing people, any person by stating the planet is over populated and we need to reduce the numbers. He wants to use the Hitler technique of killing people rather than the slightly more humane methods or sterilization, family planning or forced abortion to achieve this goal.

Uwe Boll uses Bill to get the message out that we need to kill the rich. The DVD cover was apparently done by someone who doesn't know the difference between capital and capitol as this film apparently takes place in California (?), filmed in Canada.
