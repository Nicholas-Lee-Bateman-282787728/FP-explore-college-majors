8672021,5,B00MFWMPSG,"Darwin himself wrote that The voyage of the Beagle has been by far the most important event in my life, and has determined my whole career...

This brilliant drama-documentary gives us a real flavour of what Darwins Beagle adventure was like, and shows us why it was so important for him.

Just to give a few examples, we see Darwin as a victim of severe seasickness; Captain FitzRoys doomed attempt to bring Christian civilisation to the people of Tierra del Fuego; Darwins disgust at the slavery he saw in Brazil; his scientific collecting and observation; and some incredible scenery.

We also see how Darwin developed his theory of evolution by natural selection once he was back in England; we see the impact his theory had; and we see the tragedies of FitzRoys sad end and the death of Darwins daughter Anne and two more of his children. (It was Annies death as much as his own theory which destroyed Darwins faith in Christianity.)

Darwin probably started thinking seriously about transmutation on the last stretch of his Beagle voyage in 1836. He certainly opened his first notebook on the subject in 1837, and the idea of natural selection as the mechanism of evolutionary change came to him, after reading Malthus, in 1838. In 1842 he wrote what he called the pencil sketch of my species theory, and in 1844 he wrote a fuller and more polished version, but these were not published at the time.

Darwin then spent years collecting evidence to support his theory, but he did not reveal his ideas to the public until 1859, when On the Origin of Species was published. He was finally pushed into publication when Alfred Russel Wallace came up with the same idea in 1858.

Wallace certainly deserves credit for independently coming up with the idea of natural selection, but Wallace himself was always happy to play second fiddle to Darwin. For example, in 1908 Wallace made a speech to the Linnaean Society in which he explicitly defended Darwins priority, pointing out that ...the idea occurred to Darwin in October 1838, nearly twenty years earlier than to myself (in February 1858); and that during the whole of that twenty years he had been laboriously collecting evidence...

Stephen Jay Gould once described Darwin as being radical in his scientific ideas, liberal in his political and social views, and conservative in personal lifestyle...

This film - a marvellous seven episodes (400 minutes) of viewing - shows that Goulds summary of Darwin is exactly right.

I can watch this film over and over again: the acting is very good; it is a visual treat; and I love the way that the background commentary uses Darwins own words and fits them perfectly to what we are seeing.

There is a sad footnote to the film. The ship which was used to portray the Beagle - the Marques - sank a few years later during the Tall Ships Race of 1984, with the loss of 19 of her crew.

8672022,4,B00MFWMPSG,"I am giving this 4 stars because the video has not been remastered from the SD era and is thus grainy. However, this is an amazing look at the origins of Charles Darwin as a naturalist and scientist. We see his development from a somewhat irresponsible and unfocused youth into a man beginning to become one of the most penetrating thinkers of all time. This voyage lead to one of the greatest scientific discoveries in the history of human inquiry. The acting quality and dramatic treatment of the voyage of the Beagle, and important surrounding and consequent events, is superb. The scenic elements are very good, and true to many of the important locations visited during the multi-year expedition. This voyage launched Darwin as a scientist and changed the course of modern science and human self awareness! We saw this program when it first appeared' and were overjoyed that it has finally become available. See this for its adventure, its drama, its visual beauty, its intellectual and scientific importance!
