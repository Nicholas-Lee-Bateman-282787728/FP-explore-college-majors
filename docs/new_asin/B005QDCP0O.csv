8483268,1,B005QDCP0O,"I echo the previous reviews. This is an awful copy. I could easily do a better job of creating a DVD at home from any source of this movie. I see it's no longer available from Amazon and that's good. Even the illustration on Amazon is misleading. That image you see is small 2 1/2 x 3 1/4 postage stamp sized image on the from of the crudely made DVD cover supposedly from ""Loving The Classics"".",1386374400,6,395,4.2105263157894735
8483269,1,B005QDCP0O,I have about 4 copies of this movie but this is the worst copy of the film I have ever seen.  It is unwatchable because it is blurry and dark.  I ordered this approximately first half of May and was emailed it would be delivered to me between May 15 to May 31.  I received it in early June.  I tried to return it today and was told it is past time to return.  Please help.  I have never had this problem with Amazon before.,1372118400,6,423,3.9176470588235293
8483270,1,B005QDCP0O,This DVD was copied from TV's Turner Classic Movies and I'm not sure that's even legal.  To make matters worse it's a terrible copy that won't play in my DVD player.  I finally got it to work on my laptop.  Buyer beware of this seller.,1350518400,10,235,4.177777777777778
