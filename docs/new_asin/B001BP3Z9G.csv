3496844,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Let me state upfront that I am a sucker for great non-fiction documentaries. I've always believed that life is stranger than fiction. And this is just the last (and perhaps best) example of it.

""Man on Wire"" (98 min.) tells the improbable story of Phillipe Petit's dream (and eventual reality) of walking on a high wire between the two WTC buildings on August 7, 1974. The movie starts with his humble beginngins of being a street artist, eventually leading to his wanting to do high wire walks, starting with the Paris Notre Dame, then the Sidney Harbor, and then eventually the World Trade Center Towers. The movie does an excellent job building the excitement into what it took to eventually pull off that implossible event. All of the main players of the event are interviewed now more than 30 years after the event, and Philippe Petit turns out to be a master entertainer and story teller. When you are watching it all unvolve, you can't but help be in awe of it all. Just exilerating, period.

If this movie doesn't get serious consideration of being nominated for best documentary of 2008 at the Oscars, there is something terribly wrong with the entire system. This is one of the most enthralling movies I've seen this year, and I've seen a lot of movies.",1220745600,76,1264,4.6891891891891895

3496846,4,B001BP3Z9G,"""Man on Wire"" is a new documentary about tightrope walker Phillippe Petite, who decided to string a wire, a strong wire, between the towers of the World Trade Center, just as it was being completed in 1976, and walk across, many hundreds of feet up in the air. Daring? Yes. Crazy? Yes. Beautiful? Yes. Illegal? Yes.

Directed by James Marsh, whose last film was the little seen drama ""The King"" starring Gael Garcia Bernal, Nick Nolte and Paul Dano, ""Man on Wire"" is a fun, riveting and lighthearted look at one man's daring, crazy, beautiful and illegal attempt to create a piece of living art.

The story opens with some brief ""recreations"" much like you might see on A & E these days. A date pops up and we see it is mid 1974. Young men are loading a van with equipment while a television in the background reports on the breaking Watergate Scandal. Then, a jaunty, accented voice is heard and begins to narrate the story of Philippe Petit. It is, in fact, Petit's voice and he tells us about his childhood in the South of France, and how he talked his friends into helping him build a makeshift high wire. Yes, it was only a few feet off the ground, but it allowed Philippe to practice, and practice and practice. We meet his small circle of friends including the girl who will eventually become his girlfriend.

Soon, Phillippe begins to set his sights of bigger challenges and we follow as he and his team of friends decide to set-up a wire on the top of Notre Dame Cathedral, allowing Phillippe to walk back and forth. Everything is timed for this to happen in the early morning, and it comes off like a charm. His girlfriend rushes into the cathedral, during a service and tells the priests that someone is walking between the towers of the church. Soon, a crowd has gathered and Phillippe and his friends talk about the beauty of such a statement. They are making a piece of livable art. Phillippe walks across the wire, towards the middle, slowly, and then takes a break, sitting, reclining on the wire, stretching his legs out, staying perfectly balanced. He almost looks like a ballet dancer, but hundreds of feet up in the air. Then, grainy archival news footage shows us the French police taking Phillippe away in custody.

After he is released, with a mild slap on the wrist, a mixture of recent interviews, archival footage and recreations help to give us a picture of how Phillippe got it in his mind to even think about crossing between the towers of the World Trade Center. He sees a story in the newspaper about the new building, how it will be the tallest structure in the world and it will have two towers. We learn through the interviews that Phillippe is attracted to this because of the danger, the fact that no one has ever done it before or since. The excitement plays a huge part in it, but the notoriety he will earn and the creation of living art all play a factor.

It is pretty evident from the statements of his accomplices that Phillippe is a persuasive, infectious man. As he talks about the plan, his friends, and what will be required, the director cuts to shots of the people involved, in present day, recapturing them as they recount the details. We frequently see their genuine emotions, shock and amazement as they recount the events of yesterday. These events from thirty years ago are still so powerful, they elicit honest, tangible emotions today as the subjects relate their stories. Because of this power, their emotion wears off on us.

Marsh's use of these different forms of media makes this film strikingly similar to some of Errol Morris' best work. The recreations frequently show a subject partially out of frame, deeply out of focus, to help obscure the fact actors are playing real people. Cameras zoom in for close-ups on hands, sides of faces, etc. The camera captures certain things in slow motion. The recreations almost appear to be saturated, in an attempt to match the graininess and age of the archival footage. The new interviews are crisp and well done. All of these various elements are set to a slightly playful musical score (which was also used by Peter Greenaway in ""The Draughtsman's Contract""). While not exclusive to Errol Morris, all of these elements are certainly reminiscent of his work. And when they are combined with a strange, but fitting piece of music, the film is almost a homage to the great documentarian.

When Phillippe gets the idea to cross the two towers, he enlists the aid of his friends to help with the planning and execution of the stunt. They also realize they will need the help of some Americans, some inside people, who can help them infiltrate the security of the building.

Perhaps the best thing about ""Man on Wire"" is that Marsh has constructed the entire story like a bank heist film from the 70s. We start in the middle of the story and work back to the beginning. Then we begin moving forward. The entire plan isn't revealed at the beginning, little pieces of information come in stages, keeping us interested and guessing how they will accomplish this feat.

It is also interesting to learn from current interviews how devoted Philippe's friends and girlfriend were. As they recount their involvement with Phillippe and try to explain why they were so drawn to him, they reveal how much they all loved him. It is evident he is very dynamic and engaging and it is easy to see why he was followed by these people as he attempts to pull of this dangerous feat.

There are the inevitable setbacks and these are thrilling to watch as well. The combination of these various elements helps to paint such a full picture we begin to feel we are actually a part of the story, of the mythology. Because we become a part of this tale, these setbacks affect us, make us wince and cringe. The inevitable 'silly' moments (they walk right by a security guard at one point who never says anything) make us laugh in amazement. When you think about it, there are probably very few instances when you become involved in the film to the extent you will become involved in ""Man on Wire"".

""Man on Wire"" is an involving, fun, interesting documentary. A look at a truly unique and strange individual who goes for his dreams and accomplishes them. With the exception of a brief recreation showing Phillippe partaking in the carnal benefits of his newfound celebrity, ""Wire"" is the type of film you should take the entire family to. It might give the kids a little push towards achieving their dreams and goals.

Don't miss this fun film. And see it at the theater. Encourage filmmakers to make more films like this. Don't simply wait for it on DVD.",1219536000,10,6631,4.629251700680272

3496855,5,B001BP3Z9G,"I've wanted this in my DVD library since I first saw this inspiring documentary years ago. While you'll never catch me on a wire, I do admire Mr. Petit and his feat. I was a young girl when he did this, and living in NY state at the time, so I remember the headlines making him out to be a lunatic. Far from it: He was a man with an unusual dream and enough sense to make it a reality. Heart-opening and wildly inspiring!",1481673600,,421,4.023809523809524
3496856,5,B001BP3Z9G,"I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Walk/dp/B01603ALSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Walk</a>&nbsp;(in 3D) before I saw Man on Wire. The movie left me breathless for fifteen whole minutes when that pivotal moment arrived: the walk between the Twin Towerson a wire. You're breathless because this *actually* happened. And if you don't know what eventually happened, the suspense you'll feel is probably exactly how spectators reacted that fateful day.

This documentary is about that event, or more specifically, the planning, the practicing, and the outcome of all that work. This has interviews with the actual people involved as they revisit all the events that led up to ""The Artistic Crime of the Century."" It's structured like a heist movie, where all the pieces are discussed, which greatly builds up to ""the heist.""

But the thing that sticks with you at the end are the interviews with the people (""accomplices"") involved. Philippe Petit is an eccentric Frenchmen, and the fact that he got all these accomplices to help him make this happen shows you the sheer force of his personality. Once all was said and done, you can see the toll it took on the people closest to Philippe. His best friend had no words at the end, but you can understand everything he's feeling in that moment. It will leave you in awe that this amazing thing happened, but the aftermath is sad and heartbreaking.

Were the personal sacrifices worth it to Philippe? Only he can tell you. A must-watch. Recommended.",1481155200,2,1544,5.319672131147541

3496941,4,B001BP3Z9G,"Man On Wire is a semi interesting documentary about Frenchman Philippe Petit who makes it his personal mission to walk across a high wire attached on the very top of the two World Trade Center towers.  Talk about one of the most dangerous things ever!  Not something I'd ever do.  Sorry, too terrified of heights to even climb that high let alone walk around a small wire with wind blowing!  I can imagine the wind is quite intense being up that high.  Apparently this event really happened in 1974, but this documentary is actually the first time I'm aware of it.

The story focuses on how Philippe and his friends were able to sneak inside the World Trade Center and hide from police which apparently happened a few different times, Philippe training out in the fields on high wires, his friends discussing how ambitious and stubborn Philippe always was leading to this magnificent display of courageousness, how Philippe considers such a daring feat more a work of art that can't be replicated anywhere else, and the preparations in carefully and sneakily setting up the high wire without alerting the cops.

Throughout the documentary we hear interviews from his friends who were all part of this master plan and how afterwards upon completing the walk, the New York cops weren't exactly super happy about Philippe's display of art so they arrested him and expelled him from the country.  That's harsh!  The tone of the documentary is mostly going for a light comedy feel mixed with a presentation that shows how artful and amazing high wiring can be.

I'd say this is a pretty good documentary but it can drag at times.  Also it's interesting how some of the footage is real while other moments are reenacted.  Given this movie came out in 2008, it probably influenced the recent high wire walk by Nik Wallenda in 2014.  I remember that was a chilly night too!  Interesting one of the actors in the documentary resembles Nik but much older.  Good documentary, but expect lots of dialogue reading on the bottom of the screen considering these men are French but sometimes they speak English too.",1466035200,,2099,4.775623268698061

3496980,5,B001BP3Z9G,"For anyone who remembers Philippe Petit and what he did in 1974 or for anyone who doesn't remember or wasn't around in 1974 have I got a documentary for you to watch. And let me tell you, you will not watch a more suspenseful, enthrallying film that will leave you on the edge of your seat like ""Man On Wire"". And remember I just said this was a documentary. This isn't some action packed thriller. It's a freaking documentary. Documentaries are suppose to be informative, educational, maybe sometimes even amazing. Some may also say however that documentaries are boring. Boring as hell in fact. If you think that way then just watch ""Man On Wire"" and be prepared to have those thoughts about documentaries changed.

The film is about Philippe Petit and his walk on a high wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center on August 7th 1974. But there is much more to the film then that. It looks at his life from a teenager when he first started developing an interest in wire walking to becoming a street performer in Paris. One day at the age of 18 while waiting to see a dentist Petit read an article about how the World Trade Center was going to be built in New York. Reading that would cause an obsession to occur in Petit to want to walk across the towers once they were built. In the meantime he would go on to perfect his craft and started making a name for himself as a performer. Especially with two stunts. One that saw him string a wire across the two towers of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and walk across it to walking across the Bay Harbor Bridge in Sydney Australia. In both cases he had to do both stunts secretly without any approval by government authorities. In both cases he was lead off by the police after it was all over but with no major charges levied against him.

To be able to walk across the twin towers would cause Petit to have to do the same thing and that is where the suspense of this film comes in. Along with Philippe the other members who worked to set up the secret mission planned for the towers are interviewed and talk about the years of planning and preparation to pull off this death defying stunt. As they talk about what had to take place to do all this actors re-create the scenes of the events. So many times at so many moments as they made plenty trips to the WTC to study the structure and roofs of the towers they came close to being caught and having their plans revealed. Getting their equipment in the building that Petit would need to accomplish the feat was no easy matter either with all the tension involved as they worked to get all the stuff to the top without being found out. I won't go into any detail what took place. You have to watch for yourself to see what happens to make this obsession of Petit come to fruition. I am just telling you to be prepared to be captivated by this documentary. During the part where Petit and the rest are talking about him walking across the towers you see news reel footage here and there of the World Trade Center as it is being constructed. From when it was started as a big hole in the ground to the opening dedication of the twin towers. You can't help as you watch the footage of the towers going up but remember the day they came down. The film itself makes no mention of the fate of the WTC. It doesn't have to. The image of them coming down are part of our memories forever. Instead it just reminds us of that one August day in 1974 when one man made a city look up at the towers in awe and wonder. Looking at it not in horror but in amazement as that one man walked on a wire across the towers several times.

 Also know that if you have seen or heard of the movie ""The Walk"" that was released recently that movie is based on this documentary. I have not seen ""The Walk"" yet but I look forward even more now to watch it after seeing this film. As for ""Man On Wire"" I would list this as one of the very best documentaries I have ever seen. In fact I would rate this probably one of the top 5 best documentaries I have seen. Watch this yourself and you will see what I mean.",1448582400,2,4092,4.242307692307692

Every fascinating detail is included: the original dream, the meticulous planning, the ""reconnaissance"" work done for eight months in New York, the technical and practical problems of rigging a wire between tall buildings, the unforeseen factors that almost led to failure. Petit was balancing on a rope in the full sense of the phrase.

3497113,2,B001BP3Z9G,"Oh dear. I'm in the minority on this one, but Man on Wire did very little for me.

Perhaps it's down to the unlikable Philippe Petit himself, who is surprisingly hard to root for. I didn't care for his personality and the fact that he had so much of it just exacerbated my feelings.

For a 90-minute documentary there's remarkably little actual information. My general knowledge of the incident is still almost non-existent and I only watched it last night! Too much time is spent on Petit's other exploits and the WTC walk - supposedly the focus of the film - comes perilously close to being glossed over. The basic, essential facts of the operation are recounted in an incidental manner and are buried under mumbling voices with heavy French accents.

What Petit did was undeniably spectacular - and at its best the film captures that well, with the wire walk sequence being thrilling - and I'm tempted to say it's a shame such a feat received such a poor documentary treatment, but it's an Oscar winner, and an overwhelming success with critics and audiences alike, so I'll accept that I'm just one of the few for whom it didn't work.",1444867200,2,1137,4.646766169154229

3497144,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Even though I will see ""The Walk"" Hollywood had no business altering Philippe Petit's already perfect documentary produced by Simon Chinn & directed by James Marsh. Man on wire gave me nightmares & daydreams envisioning how anyone's knees wouldn't turn to rubber. This feat is impossible with a chute, bungee or any other backup apparatus- let alone on a cable with zero sleep, zero safety equipment, bell bottoms, fog, wind & factually stoned crew members helping with the coo. You must watch this documentary- not a catch phrase ""must see"". Most things can be embellished by Hollywood & it's still enjoyable, This act does not require sensationalizing. If you watch footage of our 911 red, white & blue tragedy it is truly the Frenchman Petit who accurately encompasses how indescribably horrific it was that those maniacal murderers killed thousands of innocent people & tried to crush a wonderful vibrant city's spirit. His words really hit home & he may be the most sane of anyone on earth. Although his 1 hour walk makes you question his planet origin. Please watch.",1444348800,3,1072,4.961111111111111

I was amazed that Petit's walk was actually pulled-off, let alone successful (spoiler alert: he lives!).  And seeing the footage of his actual walk - as well as the early construction footage of the WTC - was riveting.  Although the film gives intricate detail of how the buildings were scoped + the walk was outlined and executed, it failed to reveal how Petit was financially able to carry it out.  Several flights from France to Australia (for a prior walk) and the US on a street performer's budget?  That was a curious missing link for me.

Overall, an intriguing subject and film.",1444176000,,686,4.870689655172414

Its a great story and director James Marsh uses interviews, recreations, and dramatic music to shape a compelling narrative.  Petit is still energetic and engaging, and it is not difficult to see how others could be drawn into his obsession by his passion.  For me, one of the most interesting aspects of the story is touched on at the end but not adequately explored.  It appears that once Petit had accomplished his goal, it closed that chapter of his life and he moved on, which included walking away from the people who had given so much of themselves to help.  It seems likely that this type of narcissism is an essential component for accomplishing such an amazing feat, but I found myself just as fascinated by its dark side.",1436486400,,864,4.657894736842105

3497266,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Passion is something that knows no bounds, says Philippe Petit, the man who strung a wire between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and walked on it.  This documentary of his breathtaking exhibition was made after the Towers were brought down by terrorists.  The tension one feels watching this film, of the painstaking planning and of the event itself, is quite palpable, despite knowing the outcome. Philippe Petits story of dreaming big and overcoming impossible odds is timeless.  The Frenchmans charisma and enthusiasm is overwhelming and seems to spill off the screen.  If ever there was a film to motivate people, to free them of their fear of failure and dare them to seek their dreams however difficult, this is it.  Listening to Petit for 30 minutes you begin to believe as he does that with enough passion anything is possible.

I first learned of Philippe Petit during an interview on CNN mere days after the Towers came down.  The French wire walker was on a program with American George Willig, The Human Fly, who likewise became famous in connection with the Towers.  Willig scaled the South Tower in 1977, three years after Petits daring wire walk (on August 7, 1974).  Listening to them, it was apparent that once they got their ideadespite the very real possibility of landing in jail, never mind falling to their deaththere was no turning back.  They became possessed and simply had to do it.

For Petit, it was a long journey consuming a number of years, of several flights back and forth across the Atlantic, of finding ways to get some 400 pounds of equipment and three accomplices past a network of security, and most important of all, of finding a way to get a three-quarter-inch cable strung from one tower to the next, plus four guy-wires necessary to stabilize the cable, and secure it safely on both ends, without being detected. The task was as much an engineering feat as it was a test of Petits ability to actually step out onto the wire and perform his routine without a safety net, one quarter-mile above the streets of New York City.  The lively documentary shows how he did it, and says much about his character.  To me, its so simple that life should be lived on the edge of life, says Petit.  You have to exercise in rebellion, to refuse to taper yourself to rules, to refuse your own success, to refuse to repeat yourself, to see every day, every year, every idea as a challengeand then you are going to live your life on a tight rope.",1426723200,2,2481,4.647597254004577

One is left to wonder what would have happened to his supporters if his efforts had produced a fantastic failure instead of a signal, inspiriting success.

A must see for anyone old enough to remember Phillipe Petite's amazing feat of spending forty-five minutes walking back and forth between the top of the Twin Towers in New York. A must see for anyone that is curious about why anyone would, or could do such an amazing thing. And it's also a must for any New Yorker, or New Yorker at heart. And no, it's not about NY, it's about Mr. Petite's gift to the world of sharing his dream.

The documentary takes us through the planning stages, and clandestine operation to get all of the gear and personnel to the roof, while showing us what kind of creative genius Mr. Petite is. The sequences where Mr. Petite accomplishes his ultimate goal are absolutely breathtaking, as well as inspiring.

Do yourself a favor, and forego the usual garbage that passes for entertainment. Watch MAN ON WIRE, and experience something wonderful.",1408060800,,978,4.707602339181286

Petit?  My husband and I, and another couple, saw the  premiere of this documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival a few years ago.  We were invited by my husband's colleague, Barry Greenhouse, who was complicit in helping Petit get his equipment to the Twin Towers.  It's well referenced in the film.  I have watched this documentary at least ten time.  As a college professor, teaching Writing About History, I thought this would be an excellent way to capture this historical moment, one that, sadly, can never be captured again.  When word got out to my other students, they demanded to see it as well.  I never grow tired of seeing Petit's face when he steps onto the wire and starts his trek across the towers.  He was present at the film festival and explained to those of us, still incredulous even though as New Yorkers we were well aware of Petit's feats.",1405555200,,1005,4.621468926553672

The DVD includes the story of how he got the idea, his plan and preparation, and the delightful law-breaking actions he and his team used to make it possible.

Philippe Petit comes across as a flawed protagonist. By the end of the film, we see that he has a tremendous ego (which, one could argue, is a prerequisite for such an audacious project) and is therefore incredibly self-centered. Unfortunately, by the film's end, we don't know if he has evolved in any way since 1974 or not.",1403049600,,476,4.6

Many years later I saw this film and I can't even describe how much it thrilled and amazed me. What Phillipe Petit did was breathtaking. Learning about how he managed to pull it off only adds to the enormity of his accomplishment. I like that it gives credit to his accomplices who never got much mention ,if any at all, when it happened. It is really sad though that a group of religious fanatics took the location of this daring deed away from us all and took so many thousand innocent people with them. I don't believe in hell, but if there is one, I hope the highjackers suffer there forever. Phillipe Petit took us to heaven.",1396656000,,753,4.385714285714286

3497366,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Fascinating documentary about a boy with a dream becoming a man fulfilling that dream which is something most human beings would never even fantasize about doing.

The piece builds to the crescendo of the big event by weaving the drama of how the team could pull off such an audacious act in with background on all the players.  Luckily, much video was taken way back when, so the juxtaposition of then and now is available to us as we get to know each participant and share in their emotions.  The recreation of the preparation supplies tension as we note how impossible such happy deceit would be in 2014.

Levity mixes in nicely with the true drama to make this is a unique pleasure excursion into the past and the unimaginable--except for one boy to realize his outrageous dream.",1389830400,,783,4.6521739130434785

Beggars cannot be choosers I suppose.,1372550400,,297,4.8431372549019605
3497405,5,B001BP3Z9G,Highly recommend this documentary. It's absolutely amazing. Great story. What this guy did was just brilliant. Wish there was another documentary that talked about his other amazing walks,1372118400,,187,5.714285714285714
3497406,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Philippe Petit begins: ""I started as a young self-taught wire walker, to dream of not so much conquering the universe but, as a poet, conquering beautiful stages.""  As film-watchers, though we initially approach Petit's wire walking as courage and athleticism, we learn very quickly that the athlete and his comrades view it first and foremost as a form of performance art.  As collaborators and friends are interviewed, it becomes plain that they were absolutely consumed with and commanded by the stunning beauty and artistry of what they were participating in.  During the Notre Dame walk, the elegiac Jean Louis Blondeau observes that it is ""Something that's so beautiful, not only does it not hurt somebody, but gives something to somebody ... It's a dream.""  And Petit tells us that his world is ""basically the world of a poet or a writer who decides to write in the sky.""  A bit melodramatic you might say?  The moment you see Petit perform, you learn there's nothing remotely melodramatic or deceptive about this mild-mannered yet ferocious individual; he's the real deal.  Accompanying this gorgeous film (with much vintage footage of NYC, Paris, and Sydney) is an equally gorgeous soundtrack.  The harvested music is gentle, contemplative, and transcendental, with the selection of each piece connoting painstaking consideration including (but certainly not limited to) an excerpt from Ralph Vaughan Williams' ""Lark Ascending,"" one of the most elegant pieces of early 20th century symphonic music ever written.

So much frenzied planning and activity precedes the WTC walk that it's unclear what to expect once it commences.  Yet as soon as Petit takes that first step, we become enveloped in the warmth of his concentration, certainty, and intrepidness.  Set to the reassuring calmness of Erik Satie's ""Gymnopedies,"" the walk between the Twin Towers is at the same time spectacular and quietly elegant, monumental and humbly poetic, frightening yet tranquil.  Petit is commanding and celebratory, at the height of his prowess, and seems to be in complete peace.  The fusion of art, strength, and daring is mystifying, just as Petit wants it.  His companion Annie Allix watched from the ground below, and there's a still powerful and visible sense of exhilaration as she recalls it:  ""It was extraordinary ... It was like he was walking on a cloud.  And there were such amazing moments ... when he lay down ...  We were thrilled by this image of Philippe lying down up above ... It was so beautiful!""  Collaborator Jim Moore recalls:  ""The awe of the event and the overwhelming scale of the situation ... was magical ... profound.""  It's clear that each participant was affected in ways that have lasted a lifetime.  Petit would later say the towers were his throne, ""the sun my scepter, my cape the wind.""  There are no moving images of the WTC walk, only still photography--a testament to the enduring power of the photograph. Petit later observed that he was initially ""devastated"" that there were no movie images, but that ""now 35 years later I think it's fabulous that there is no film.""  The documentary's focus is on the personalities, the caper, and the artistry, not the ""whys"" compelling the dare.  Petit would later say that what made these walks so beautiful is that there were no whys.  As for the storyline involving Philippe's desertion of his friends as his fame grew, that appears to have involved a bit of literary license.

Says Petit, ""Living intensely is a magnificent way of living ... But it doesn't happen every day.  One has to fight for it.""  Most of us ordinary folk may not be able to follow our passions with the precise same vigor and apparent fearlessness of a Philippe Petit.  But we can certainly try to live life to the fullest, to give our personal best, to be just a little less pragmatic and a little more inspired.  Man On Wire makes you want to do that.  What more can one ask of a film.  Petit leaves us with this:  ""Life should be lived on the edge of life.  You have to experience rebellion, to refuse to taper yourself to rules, to refuse [to deny] your own success ... to see every day, every year, every idea as a true challenge.  And then you have only to live your life on a tight rope.""",1371772800,,4244,4.839112343966713
3497407,4,B001BP3Z9G,"This documentary tells the story of Frenchman, Philippe Petit as he develops a passion for ""wire-walking"". It includes actual footage from his own filming of his younger years, as well as footage leading up to his daring (and illegal) wire-walk between the World Trade Center towers in 1974. Fascinating story, but a bit draggy in places. Altogether, though, a heart stopping film.",1371772800,,381,5.161290322580645
3497408,5,B001BP3Z9G,"I was nine years old when this event took place, and had just moved from NY to NJ. I remember my parents and their friends talking so much about it. I saw the NY Times photos in my house on the breakfast table. I thought it was cool.

I don't remember ever really thinking about it again, even when the towers were destroyed. But when I came across the movie on Amazon I was intrigued to find out 'the real story', and boy am I glad I did. What an amazing adventure, from his initial flash of inspiration, to his obsession to achieve his wirewalking dream, to his planning/practicing, and finally to his band of misfit (and I mean that in the kindest sense) accomplices.

To see the behind the scenes story played out, with some very cool archival movie footage, really made the story come alive. Philippe himself is a giant among men, unable to see limitations. To witness his walk, to see the photos, to see the heights...... breathtaking is the only word that comes to mind.

What kind of person would even think about doing this, much less actually do it? A man like Philippe, who lives his life to the fullest, and whose talents and physical and mental abilities put him a cut above. I am humbled to even have seen this story, it's just unreal that he not only pulled it off, but achieved it with the showmanship he always displayed in his performances.

The dry humor, multiple points of view, and details of the planning make it that much more compelling to watch. Sure it would have been great to see more movie footage of the actual walk, but the stills somehow provided more feedback about the enormity of the scale and the incredible danger of the walk itself.

towers of the World Trade Center.

The movie shows how they planned and executed
this daredevil event, and a bit of the life and history

I taped it first on my DVR and it just sat there for months until I saw it on Amazon prime when I was looking for something to watch.  So I started it and the more I watched, the more interesting it was.  I love history and learning from other people's experiences.  Philippe Petit really fascinated me.  They interview him and others in present time, as well as through decades old footage.  It was so interesting to learn what was going through his mind, how he first saw a picture of the buildings being planned and wanted to cross between them before they were even built!  Then later, how he took several trips to New York to investigate it and find a way to do it.  Eventually he found people to help him sneak 450 lb wire past security guards, and figured out a way to stretch the wire between the buildings.  I knew in the end he was going to do it, but all the details and motivations that led up to it were truly fascinating the way it was all told.  Even after the event, watching how he dealt with the notoriety of an awe struck woman, and his openness about all that.  It just made the whole story such a nice look into the life of someone else who I will never be.  Truly, probably mostly because of its uniqueness, this was one of the best documentaries I think I have ever watched.

3497462,4,B001BP3Z9G,"Precious little was golden about the 25 year old Philippe Petit's August 7th, 1974 daredevil tightrope walk between the Twin Towers, 50 years after the death of George Mallory. I recall the day it happened, and for a few weeks afterwards, Petit's name had dwarfed that of the legendary daredevil Evel Knievel's. Then, he was forgotten. But, before the 1993 attacks on the World Trade Center and the 2001 9/11 bombings and destruction of the towers, his `coup,' as Petit calls it, was easily the most memorable event in the history of the two ugly towers.

  The film goes in to great detail on how meticulously Petit and his cohorts planned the event, as well as earlier escapades at the Notre Dame Cathedral and a bridge in Sydney, Australia. It charts Petit's obsession with the Towers after reading of their building as a teenager. The film draws a reader n to the main event as well as any `hesit' or `caper' film made by Hollywood ever has, and Petit is a fascinating personality, albeit a bit grating. The 94 minute film never makes mention of the events of 9/11 and, on the plus side, this means no restatement of the obvious clichs and bathos. On the negative side- and this is likely the lone negative of this otherwise great film, the film misses a golden showcase for us to get a real `in' to Petit's psyche, when he is not clearly mugging for the camera. After all, could anyone have had dearer feelings for those buildings than he?

  Nonetheless, the film succeeds on almost all other levels, from some truly inventive cinematography by Michael Nyman, to exquisitely edited footage and photographs by Jinx Godfrey, to J. Raph's and Michael Nyman's wonderful musical scoring; the highlight of which is Erik Satie's Gymnopaedies, especially #3, so skillfully employed in scenes of Petit's actual walk, making this film the third member of a trilogy of great films deploying this signature piece; the others being Woody Allen's Another Woman and Louis Malle's My Dinner With Andre. The re-enactments and descriptions of the planning- from fake IDs to the wires to faking invoices to hiding for hours on the top floors of the two towers, then waiting to rig the equipment all up, is fascinating, and Marsh nicely intercuts elements of the training in with the re-enactments so that, by film's end, viewers long familiar with the `coup' will be seeing it with the awe of those people lucky enough to have viewed the actual walk all those decades ago.",1359676800,,2459,4.774117647058824

He supplied the talent, but he could not have articulated this talent without the help of others.  Where does he go when it's over.

3497477,4,B001BP3Z9G,"Honestly, this is a movie I started watching by accident, not intent. (I thought this was ""Man on a Ledge"" I just had the title wrong.)  But since I was busy eating my nachos and my fingers were messy, I let it play figuring I'd change it when I finished eating.

Wire walking takes incredible skill, natural ability and guts and I can appreciate all that - but to me it's not particularly exciting/interesting to watch someone walk back and forth. Perhaps partly because I don't expect them to fall I guess. But I found myself more and more absorbed and appreciative of the incredible amount of planning and commitment and risk - and by the people telling the story.

Amazingly, there is a lot of original footage in this film and the excitement and energy of the people involved sortof pulls you in like a magnet.  The story is told with great detail and enthusiasm/energy and you understand that Philippe is passionately driven to do this.  The kind of passion and drive that can't be stopped as long as there is a breath in the body and a mind to dream with.  This is a guy who looks at the feat and says, ""yes, sure I could die in a moment here - it could all end now... but it would be sooo worth taking this chance - this big bite out of LIFE""  And when you watch his face go from stress/anxiety to taking those first few steps on the wire and suddenly breaking into a fully joyous expression... well,for a few moments you can sortof feel that too. It was an incredible achievement.

This documentary was extremely well done. I'm glad I saw it, even if only by mistake.

Another amazing thing is that they have film-quality footage of themselves when they were all young preparing for this caper.

I also like how they show real videos and pictures of him wire-walking  between the twin towers. The fact that the performance was separated into different parts of the video therefore giving the documentary a plot not in chronological order, only made watching the video a much more alluring experience.

Phillipe described his life as a wire-walker, particularly, his experience with the twin towers in such a vivid fashion that it was a challenge for me to unglue my eyes from the monitor. I'm sure other viewers would feel similarly. The video includes several of Phillipe's close friends and team members for the twin tower expedition (most fall into both categories) who enrich the viewing by providing their thoughts and feelings about Phillipe and his passions. Phillipe also portrays his philosophical views verbally and  nonverbally throughout the video which I personally found very interesting.

This epic documental captures with maxim eloquence the irrverence, efforts and inner tensions that accompanied this singular human being, who bet everything for being there at the top of the world.

Petit - as well as most of these intrepid beings - crossed over the land of the forbidden, rules and this universe of current conventions to make his dream come true.

3497517,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Yes, there is someone crazier than the building-climbing ""Spiderman,"" and his name is Phillippe Petit, who will forever be known for his death-defying tightrope walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on August 7, 1974.  He didn't simply walk; over the course of eight crossings, he knelt, lay, saluted, and all but danced 1368 feet above the teeming crowd below for some forty-five minutes.  Man on Wire (the title comes from the police description of the incident) is the story of what has been called the artistic crime of the century, from the birth of the dream inside a dentist's office in 1968 to the completion of the amazing feat six years later.  While there are plenty of interviews with Petit's friends and accomplices, this is truly Petit's story.  Somewhere around 60 years of age now, Petit emotes a flamboyant energy and passion that demands your undivided attention, making it easier to see how he was able to recruit the team members necessary to pull off such a suicidal, highly illegal and seemingly impossible ""le coup.""  When this film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, Petit balanced the Oscar on his chin for the audience, in true showman fashion.

Obviously, you don't just climb to the top of one of the Twin Towers, throw a cable across to the sister tower, and walk across.  The planning took six years.  During that time, Petit and several of his accomplices spent months basically casing the site, figuring out how to evade different levels of security, sneaking up to the roof on several occasions, taking photographs and constructing scale models to see how to set up the rigging for the walk, and trying to create during training the sort of unstable conditions Petit would face during his feat.  At one point, he passed himself off as a writer for a French architecture magazine in order to interview workers who were still completing the construction of the buildings.  While the Frenchman had made death-defying tight rope walks at Notre Dame Cathedral and Sydney Harbor Bridge, he had never faced the dangers that this walk entailed.

There's rather a sad side to Petit's story, as well - namely, the breakdown of some of Petit's personal relationships in the wake of his great triumph.  One gets the sense that, even as she watched him make this magical tightrope walk, Petit's extremely supportive girlfriend sensed that she was losing him - both personally and spiritually.  Petit now belonged to the world that reveled in his daring accomplishment, and the man gleefully recounts how he made passionate love to one of his brand new fans as soon as he was released from police custody.  It is the story of Petit's relationships with the men and women who devoted themselves to helping him realize his dangerous dream that makes this documentary such an emotional viewing experience.  Petit is revealed herein with all of his spots, which makes this a very human story.  The charisma of the man is also something to behold, and listening to him speak about his art and dreams is nothing short of spellbinding.  I could never have turned my eyes to the sky to watch this man taunt death between the Twin Towers, but nothing could have taken my eyes off of every second of this unique and powerful documentary.",1298160000,,3291,4.817051509769094

3497519,2,B001BP3Z9G,"I don't get it. The movie is good but not anywhere near great. It is really about some obviously rich kids with nothing better to do than pull a stunt that probably cost NYC millions as the traffic and police needed to clear below this stunt were used. The stunt is made out to be incredibly dangerous but in truth Petit crossed back and forth 8 times, laid down, waved to people, etc. I admit anything done from that height is dangerous but his apparent ability to go back and forth so many times shows it was not nearly the incredible feat the movie tries to make. I say rich kids because no working person would have had the time and money to do this nonsense. Petit and friends spent months planning, meeting, practicing, buying thousands of dollars of cable and equipment. No working person could spare the time or money. I believe Petit and crew could have put the money and talents to better use.
The movie makes this out to be a sort of event of a lifetime. Well, I was alive and in my 20's in 1974 and this was nothing more than a blurb on the nightly news and an event I just vaguely remember. The walk on the moon, Woodstock, the Jets winning the Super Bowl,and so many other events around that time were so much more burned into memory.
I felt cheated and duped. I was expecting as one reviewer said, ""a heart pounding thriller"". Hardly. A well planned circus stunt? Yes. Some rich kids having fun while thousands of people below were stopped from getting to work, doing their jobs and a total disruption of the city is not something to be idolized over.
The movie is at best a 3 star movie. Well done but in the end not satisfying, inspiring or worth having spent my 90 minutes.

The film uses the docu-history technique to build suspense leading up to the finale.

3497521,5,B001BP3Z9G,"When Philippe Petit, after astounding the world with almost an hour of antics - walking, jumping, dancing and even reclining - on a steel cable strung between the Twin Towers on August 7th, 1974, before giving himself up to the New York police, the enigmatic entry under which he was booked read ""Man on wire.""

This is how the police viewed his act and also how most of the world viewed it - as the act of a crazy individual who, balancing on a steel cable rigged precariously at a height of 1,368 ft above the streets of New York, had astounded everyone by crossing and recrossing eight times before rain brought an end to his performance.

If the thousands watching Petit had been asked what they had seen they would probably have answered, like the police, that they had seen a man on a wire. However, it seems clear from the movie that many of the onlookers, far from merely having seen a man on a wire, had experienced something so beautiful and profound that it could only be described as religious or spiritual; they had seen a man becoming truly a man or even something more than a man; they had witnessed him demonstrating the full potential that lies buried deep within all of us. I think this is why they were so moved that some of them wept.

Awakening normally takes place in isolation. No-one actually saw the Buddha become a buddha. But when Petit, courting death and moved by some inexplicable force, took that first grim step onto the swaying steel cable and we saw his face suddenly melt into an ecstatic smile, at that very moment he triumphantly conquered the universal fear of death, shattered the prison of ego and, buddha-like, became one with the cable, the towers, the watching crowd, the city, the world and the universe itself and I'm sure some in the crowd must have felt this. The ancient Indian philosopher Nagarjuna (c. 150 - 250 CE) explains:

""When buddhas don't appear
And their followers are gone,
The wisdom of awakening
Bursts forth by itself.""

The world, in short, was granted the privilege of witnessing the awakening of a man, human as we are human, beautifully bursting forth into his full potential as man on wire became buddha on wire.",1294099200,,2180,4.608247422680412

3497526,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Man On A Wire is one of those documentaries that stay with you. It is excellent and has a low to offer those of a thoughtful nature. First of all, it is a demonstration of the human spirit and the single-mindedness of the central character to perform an impossible feat: string a wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center and walk back and forth without a net. The footage is clearly amazing. Watching Mr. Petit walk back and forth on this wire (and at one point laying down  in the prone position on the wire) is staggering. His accomplishment was an unparalleled athletic performance that will never be repeated.

That alone warrants the purchase of the movie. However there is much more to be considered. Of particular interest is the slight of hand that was necessary to get to the top of the World Trade Center unobserved with all of the equipment. Though slow in parts, the fact that they (Petit and his associates) pulled it off will be quite amusing to many who watch the film. But there is much more to this part of the film than meets the eye. Let me explain this in terms of a metaphor.

I have a neighbor who has a large dog that kept escaping and running around at night. He tried everything and finally augment the 6 foot wooden fence, that was meant to contain his dog (""Buck""), with an electronic fence. It worked and the problem was solved. About a year or so later he had no problems with Buck escaping so he turned off the electricity as a cost saving measure. Buck has not tried to escape because he continues to believe that if he tries to get out he will get an electric shock. In some respects Buck the dog is everyman because he believes the ""juice"" is on and that he will be stopped from exercising his freedom. What this documentary also demonstrates brilliantly that we, like Buck, believe that we are constrained in our freedom. we believe that will be stop from entering or leaving certain places or not eligible for opportunities that are ""restricted"" rather than the many. The  bottom line is that dogs and people act upon what they believe to be real rather than what actually is real. In this regard Man On A Wire is a brilliant ethno-methodological study about reality and illusion. The reality was the central character's incredible skill to perpetrate this accomplishment with the illusions that were dispelled by him and his hearty band of non-conformists' ability to make it happen.",1276646400,2,2432,4.583908045977012

3497529,4,B001BP3Z9G,"Man on Wire (James Marsh, 2008)

I've been reading commentary about Man on Wire in the weeks since I watched it, and what most surprises me is the number of people who don't get it. It seems obvious to me, because it's a very basic thing; unlike most documentaries, which make no apology for being documentaries, Man on Wire is structured like a suspense film. It's a documentary that doesn't play like a documentary, and there seems to be no recognition of this among those who don't get it. (Of course, that may mean Marsh did his job all too well; the people who don't get it may have actually thought they were watching a suspense film, in which case, it is awfully slow.) If they do get it, and still don't like the movie, well, more power to them. I can understand that. It just depresses me when something so different is treated like something that's the same.

Man on Wire is the story of French tightrope walker Phillipe Petit's greatest achievement: tightrope walking between the still-under-construction Twin Towers in the early 1970s. For some reason, I always assumed that this had been sanctioned, so I was fascinated by the planning it took to do all this (a good chunk of the middle third of the movie reminded me of a number of bank heist films I've seen over the years). Necessarily, a lot of the description of how the thing was pulled off required a lot of re-enactment, and I've read where that turned some people off. But really, did you want even more head shots of people sitting around and talking? We already got a lot of those. Besides, there's a studied (and, I'm sure, conscious) cheesiness to the re-enactment scenes that put me in mind of Spike Jonze's video for the Beastie Boys song ""Sabotage"", and that can never be a bad thing. Fake mustaches!

No, it isn't an actual suspense film. It's still a movie that's going to go at the speed of documentary (and I mean actual documentary here, rather than the recent flood of ""agitprop masquerading as documentary"", viz. Michael Moore or The Company or other such silliness). And yet it doesn't feel quite right to call it ""documentary"" in the same vein as something like Winged Migration or Hoop Dreams. If Hitchcock had made a documentary, it might look like this, and that is about the highest praise I can think of to heap on this movie's back. ****",1268697600,5,2331,4.585131894484412

3497536,4,B001BP3Z9G,"Anyone who says French guys are wimps (hey, JC!) oughta be forced to view Man on Wire. Just sitting through this film in the comfort of my media room, seeing its shots of the enormity of the height of the World Trade Center and contemplating what Philippe Petit undertook made my blood pressure shoot up to stroke levels. Petit's walk between the twin towers nearly forty years ago shows how great/insane/driven the human species can be, and how very different we all are, for I personally can think of few things more horrific than walking on a thin wire at a great height. (Let alone dancing, sitting, lying and trotting across the wire, as Petit did!) Years ago in college my roommate's brother, himself a rock climber and thrill seeker, used to try to explain to me that there is a ""black line"" in climbing, a hypothetical point, usually set at fifty feet, below which survival from a fall is possible and above which survival is impossible. ""Once you pass the black line, height becomes meaningless and you might as well be climbing at  a mile as fifty-one feet."" Be that as it may, even thinking about the feat depicted in this award winning film set me off into hissy fits of couch potato wussiness.

All that said, I didn't find Man on Wire to be five-star material. It was interesting, it set my pulse racing, it was certainly a valuable documentary on a great moment in lawbreaking history, but it was also maddeningly uneven in its pace and structure. As the person who watched it with me commented, ""Blink twice and you miss him doing the actual walk."" An exaggeration, but I did find myself wishing more time had been spent showing the actual walk and letting its participants tell of the aftermath of the undertaking than in showing us for what felt the third or forth time the process of hiding under canvas in the planning stage while scoping out the Trade Center. Perhaps having Philppe Petit talk about his feelings on the loss of those grand structures would have added a postscript of sorts to it all, too.

Man on Wire is well worth seeing and even owning. It is a window into the mind of an exceptional man and a look back at a time that was both relatively recent and artificially long ago.

This movie screams, ""Follow your dreams and take risks for God's sake, because life is too short to remain on the sidelines."" Bravo Monsieur Petitt.",1263513600,,538,4.988888888888889

3497542,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Man on Wire is an incredibly impressive documentary about a man who's most impressive achievement, the achievement this documentary is centered around, wasn't even caught on video. Almost as impressive as the man this documentary is about is the way the documentary was made, using present-day interviews, dramatic re-enactments, and photographs to illustrate the one-of-a-kind tightrope walk by Philippe Petit.

The title comes from a description of Petit in the police report filed after he walked between the two World Trade Center towers. The film begins with people recounting what lead up to Petit's high-wire act, while a well-filmed reenactment plays. This opening scene is actually suspenseful, even though much of the audience will already know what Petit did. The film follows Petit, a self-taught wirewalker, as he recalls first hearing of the towers before they had even been built and his desire to walk across them the moment he heard about them. The World Trade Center was not the first building Petit had walked across; in fact he once walked the Notre Dame Cathedral. Of course, we do see video footage of Petit walking on a tightrope, as well as jogging on one. When Petit does his tightrope walks, it's a beautiful spectacle and Petit should be happy to know that the beauty he saw in his acts is not lost on his audience.

Of course, when Petit finally announced his plans to his friends/team to walk the two Towers, he was met with skepticism. Even his girlfriend Annie, who had supported all his (illegal) walking endeavors, was unsure of this. The towers were still under construction when Petit began planning and it made it easy for him to sneak in. While there is video footage of Petit plotting, there is (as I said earlier) no video footage whatsoever of him walking between the towers. The photographs of this act alone are breathtaking, but video is not necessary to lend to the credibility of this documentary.

Annie says that Petit saw his act almost like a bank robbery and there are scenes here that seem to be illustrating a real-life bank robbery. This makes the documentary all the more engrossing and accessible even. How often can you say a documentary was not only thrilling, but suspenseful? Not only that, Man on Wire uses dramatic reenactments better than just about anything I've seen. It's done in an artistic way as a way to visually illustrate the story being told to us, without just being a contrived way to have less interview footage. Petit says in the film, referring to the dangers of his twin tower walk, ""if I died...what a beautiful death."" This is obviously a poetic outlook on the consequences that could have come from his act, but you believe that he believes it to be true. Some have called Petit narcissistic, but he deserves to be. I personally would be quite impressed with myself if I had pulled something of this magnitude off. Petit did not help world hunger, his act did not change the world, he's not a hero to the world...In fact, before the release of this documentary I had never heard of Petit. But he did give the world something dangerously beautiful to marvel at and this marvelous documentary, as well as the events that have occurred since Petit's walk, have taken that beautiful act and made it all the more beautiful and poignant.

3497544,3,B001BP3Z9G,"It's clear to me that the Oscar was granted due to the subject matter; the nostalgia for the time when the Twin Towers were brand new, and when America was free enough that a man could actually wire walk between them without being picked off by a police or military sniper in mid-performance or being sentenced to life after he walked off the wire.  It's impossible for an American to watch this movie and not be constantly reminded of 9/11; this movie takes back the Towers from Bin Laden to some extent, and for that reason alone I think it won the Oscar for best documentary.  I felt the nostalgia myself, being old enough to remember Petit's feat and the construction of the Towers.

It's great to see Petit perform; his enthusiasm is contagious; and as the participants admit, the planning and execution of the walk are like a heist movie where no one is robbed or hurt.  The climax, where we see him walking between the Towers, is worth watching the entire movie to see.  But the remainder of the film is flawed.  Primarily, I wanted to know more about his friends who helped him in his guerilla wire-walking endeavors, particularly the Americans who he recruited in New York.  How did he meet them?  Why did they agree to help?  I understand that artistically the choice may have been made to not tell us; it's Petit's life, and they're just along for the ride, and cut loose after he reached his lifelong dream.  But I think it would have been a better documentary if we knew a little more about how he persuaded his friends and helpers to help with his epic feat.  It's not like the movie didn't have enough time; even at 100 minutes, it felt awfully long.

""Man on Wire"" is at least worth a rent; you will like it, even if you don't love it.  But it probably won't be a movie you'll want to add to your permanent collection.",1257379200,8,1834,4.438805970149254

3497547,5,B001BP3Z9G,"`Man on Wire' is a documentary about Phillipe Petit's shocking 1974 high wire walk between the Twin Towers.  The movie starts with a short history of his previous high wire capers, which included spanning the towers of Notre Dame and the Sydney Harbour Bridge (thankfully well-documented by his crew) , and, briefly, Petit's telling of how his dream of crossing the Towers came about in a dentist's waiting room.  Most of the movie, however, deals with the logistics of his most famous crossing, which included months of casing the Towers (where was the security?), lots of practice wire-walking with simulated high winds (his friends yanking and pulling on his practice wire), and, finally, the recruitment of a few Americans, who the French didn't trust, though they seemed to be critical to pulling the project off.

There was a point about 2/3 of the way through where the pace of the movie slowed somewhat, perhaps purposely done, when the team began to feel they would never pull it off.  This was somewhat enhanced by the natural impatience I had knowing what would happen and wanting to get to it.  But for the most part, Petit keeps the narrative moving ahead full-steam with his natural, animated gift for storytelling.  Other participants, especially Petit's girlfriend and best friend at the time, build-up the emotional aspect of what was to happen.  Still, when the main event finally happens to Satie's beautiful Gymnopedies No 3, the rest of the movie fades away and you are left with something so breathtaking you cannot remove your eyes from the film.  The hair on the back of my neck stood up while I watched these scenes, both from on-coming vertigo (especially from scenes of him lying on the wire, or leaning on one knee) and his girlfriend's beautiful description of the event.  There are pictures of him from the ground where he is a tiny speck to the on-lookers, and pictures of him from the roof where you can read his face: fully focused on his performance, or grinning at the approaching police.  All of them are awesome in their own way, and remind us of the importance of perspective in art.

And that is exactly what this was: art.  Some viewers will get that, others will see it as just a publicity stunt .  Others still will miss the emotions, but still appreciate it for the fascinating act it was.  Some reviewers have mentioned the sad aspects of the story.  Good art, no matter how outwardly joyous, will have strains of melancholy.  It seems sad that friendships went by the wayside after this, but what were they to do for an encore?

3497554,5,B001BP3Z9G,"""Man on Wire"" (2008) is a fascinating, suspenseful documentary with rare footage and some reenactments. On August 7, 1974, Philippe Petit an impish, pixyish Frenchman spent an hour tight-roping on a wire suspended between the towers of the World Trade Center. He spent months of preparation for his feat and gathered a team of helpers that included one inside operative. Incidentally there is no video footage of the event, but the film does include stunning still shots.
 Petit was a daredevil who was greatly challenged to perform amazing exploits. Previously he had tight-roped between the towers of Notre Dame and also the Harbor Bridge in Sydney, Australia, in 1973.
 He and his team traveled to the United States several times, planning and preparing, and they had made an aborted attempt. Back in France Petit practiced simulating the sway and wind conditions between the towers. We do see video footage of their planning sessions. Finally he hit on the idea of getting his wire across the vast open space, by shooting an arrow with a filament that could be tied to the tight rope itself.
 On the morning of August 7, he and an assistant went up in one tower while other members of the team went up the other tower to shoot the arrow across. He knew he was risking his life and his liberty for this dangerous stunt, but the Towers were irresistible to this daredevil.
After crossing several times, flaunting his balancing skills, he was arrested, sent to a mental facility for observation and eventually merely slapped on wrist for his daring stunt. The Towers proved irresistible to others because one man scaled one of the Towers.
As one who visited the Towers on occasion, it was very poignant seeing the Towers in all their glory in their early days. Because they were so famous, so massive and so iconic, they also proved to be an irresistible target to the terrorists on September 11, 2001. Those gleaming towers beckoned to daredevils, but unfortunately they attracted those crying out for attention by wreaking havoc.
The docu-drama is well-told, and it builds to a climax. The interviews with Petit and his associates add a great deal to the motivation behind the stunning event. Petit was determined, supremely self-confident, and egocentric. After he made his initial steps crossing the wire, his grim look turned to a smile of triumph.
Author Colum McCann has taken that day and created a critically acclaimed novel called ""Let the Great World Spin"" (2009) using the event as the fulcrum in the lives of a number of his fictional characters.",1249689600,,2560,4.894009216589862
3497555,1,B001BP3Z9G,"This documentary about the tightrope walker who walked between the World Trade Center towers was ruined for me because of the inability of the French to describe anything without being over-the-top and histrionically flamboyant. It's not enough that Phillippe the tightrope walker and his girlfriend are in love. Every time they embrace it has to be like they ""will never see each other again.""  He doesn't just look at her; his eyes are filled with madness. She doesn't simply start dating him; she comes to the  philosophical realization that she has no unique destiny of her own --her ""destiny is tied up with his."" He doesn't just like the idea of walking between the towers; he has to believe that they were put there for him. It's OK if he dies falling because it is beautiful to die doing something you are passionate about. When he walks on top of Notre Dame cathedral, his girlfriend is ""dumbstruck"" to discover that priests are being ordained inside the cathedral (why was she dumbstruck? Notre Dame is a Catholic cathedral, after all, not some fried chicken joint). Everything he and his girlfriend do and say is wildly theatrical and exaggerated. They are passionate --correction, wildly passionate-- about life and its possibilities (if I thought that life's greatest possibility was to perform a circus act, as these two apparently do, I would put a pistol to my head). I mustn't have felt as passionately about walking on a tightrope as these two hyperventilating French lovers do because  this film bored and annoyed me. I found myself wishing that Phillippe would stumble and fall to his death - as passionately as I know that he was capable of doing, of course. I'm not one of those Americans who hate the French--yet. But if I am ever exposed to another ninety minutes of French emotional mania, I may decide that the only proper response to anything even remotely French is the kind of loathing that throws the doors of hell open.",1247961600,20,1950,4.8149253731343284

3497558,1,B001BP3Z9G,"I had high hopes for ""Man on Wire."" Surely the Oscar winning documentary in a year with a particularly crowded and high-quality field would be something remarkable. Unfortunately, the film was an overproduced and slick, if tense and suspenseful, celebration of narcissistic masculinity from the beginning to an end that culminated, predictably enough, in mile-high sexual hijinks. That it won the Academy Award speaks more to the priorities of Oscar voters, who seemed to respond to the ways this documentary closely resembled its narrative cousins (charismatically inscrutable protagonist, suspenseful action, elegantly shot and edited re-enactment sequences) than to the aesthetic and social potential of the documentary genre. That the Academy rewarded a film celebrating the individual pursuit of ""because it's there"" adventuring over docs exploring social themes (such as ""The Garden"" and ""Trouble the Waters"") struck me as a strangely escapist retreat from politics in a year marked by a renewed investment in and hope for the power of collective action.

""Man on Wire"" is an exceptionally well-made film, hitting pitch-perfect notes in terms of production values, editing, and the creation of suspense even when the audience knows precisely how everything will end. Yet it feels rote, even derivative. The reliance on lengthy re-enactment sequences channels Errol Morris with perhaps a bit too much fealty. But while Errol Morris is keenly attune to the way images have effects in the world, ""Man on Wire"" is content to do nothing beyond making the audience gasp at the audacious protagonist and virtuosic filmmakers.

3497559,5,B001BP3Z9G,"On August 7th 1974, a young Frenchman named Philippe Petit stepped out on a wire and illegally rigged between the New York's twin towers. After nearly an hour dancing on the wire, he was arrested, taken for psychological evaluation, and brought to jail before he was finally released.

Sounds simple, right?  It sounds like a pretty amazing accomplishment, maybe a little crazy, but probably not worth a full-length documentary.  A fifteen minute news story, perhaps...but that's it.

But I had never thought of how much work and planning had to go into bringing high-wire wizard Phillipe Petit to the moment when he could step out onto that wire a quarter-mile above the streets of NYC.  But MAN ON WIRE is a wonderful immersion into the crazy events and slightly unhinged group of friends who worked so hard to give Philippe that one magical hour.

Petit was a wire-walker of some reknown before this accomplishment...but that's all relative.  Despite the fact that he had walked between the two towers of Notre Dame in his native France, and between to towers spanning a bridge in Australia...he wasn't exactly a household name.  Apparently, he somehow made a decent enough living as a street performer, because he certainly flies himself and his friends back and forth to the States pretty often...all to case the Twin Towers.  (The movie never explains the financial logistics, a small oversight.)

He is surrounded by friends, a loyal girlfriend, and various hangers-on who take an interest in his work.  He holds them in a benevolent thrall.  This all takes place in the early '70s, and they were all young adults...so I suspect that their lifestyles weren't all just about tightrope walking.  Perhaps there was a little ""partying"" going on as well.  We see in some fabulous vintage footage the gang of conspirators working on various projects.  Much of this home movie footage is in glorious color, and the crazy color schemes that were so prevalent in the '70s just POP out of the screen in a way that draws you right in to this world.

The movie is told almost entirely by the real life people involved in the events.  These great aging storytellers recall the events for us in a wonderful way...both factual and poetic.  Petit is there, of course, and heavily featured, but his unknown helpers (French, American & Australian) and his girlfriend all have delightful insights to contribute.  Granted, all of them are photographed in flattering light and no doubt all their clumsy moments have been edited from the footage...but there is something joyous about seeing them recalling the great events of their youths some 35 years past.  We can see them young again.  To me, this is the real lesson of MAN ON WIRE...the transformative power of being able to look back on a life well lived.  Of having a memory so unique and singular that you and a few friends shared...and which you can happily share with the world now.

But don't get me wrong...much of the movie is as dramatic as a well-written caper movie.  These humble, awkward ""kids"" have to concoct a plot to sneak men and equipment to the top of the towers and devise a way to send a heavy cable across 200ft of space between the towers.  There are moments of real tension here, as we imagine how scary and just a touch insane they were.  (In fact, many of the friends were so frightened, they couldn't actually go through with it.)

And it isn't spoiling anything to say that they succeeded.  Phillipe Petit did indeed cross those towers.  And those moments are oddly moving.  Why should a crazy frenchman walking across the space between the two Trade Center buildings generate any reaction other than, ""he's crazy and he's going to kill himself?""  Yet I found a good lump in my throat when it happens.  There is a rich emotional payoff that makes this fascinating movie a must-see.

My other complaint is that we get virtually no follow up. We see the few days after the event, and then it's vaguely shared that the relationships between these friends changed...but that's it.  No ""here they are now"" moments.  This isn't TRULY a failing of the film so much as my failing as an audience member expecting to be handed a neatly bundled package.  I recognize that...but it doesn't change my disappointment.  And the DVD has no bonus features that would help with this...so I was doubly disappointed!

Incidentally, the movie NEVER mentions the events of 9/11...but it never has to.  For me, MAN ON WIRE shows a different world...one in which there were two giant towers in the middle of the greatest city on earth, and how one man understood that he could do something strange and profound there.  And we know that now, this will never happen again, because this is no longer a world in which these two towers stand.  MAN ON WIRE allows you to think about what the towers meant to YOU.  Maybe you won't think of 9/11 at all...but I did, and I'm richer for it.",1245283200,,4925,4.739130434782608
3497560,4,B001BP3Z9G,"What is most striking to me about Philippe Petit is that there's nothing to say about him since he walked the WTC in 1974.  Up till then he was always in the process of planning or doing something with his art, but then what?

For his friends (and his lover) who would do anything for him, where what enabled him to do what he did.  He actually had the easiest job (walking the wire), they had to figure out and to do the rigging and worry how they would explain to the authorities how and what happened.  If he makes it he's a star, if he doesn't have to worry, he's a splat on the ground.  It's his friends that will morn and have fingers pointed at.

You can feel the sadness in most of his friends that were interviewed.  For most of them it was the most exciting time of their lives and nothing they've done since has been anything worth talking about (literally because they don't).  He also doesn't seem to have had any contact with these people in years.  It reminded me of the Bruce Springsteen song, ""Glory Days"", with all these people talking about something that was so important to them but has been gone so long.

3497561,4,B001BP3Z9G,"The spotlight customer review here on this page perfectly nails my feeling of the movie:  ""Beneath the Thrill, a Lot of Sadness.""

Exactly.  It takes an enormous ego to pull off what Philippe Petit did.  That combined with the hothouse environment required to plan and execute the WTC caper led to an irreparable rupturing of Petit's closest relationships, most notably with childhood friend, chief planner, right-hand man and unsung hero, Jean Louis Blondeau.  James Marsh's movie makes clear: No Blondeau, No Petit.  Blondeau's reaction to his passing of his friendship is real and still visceral: he breaks down in tears discussing it.  Post-film interviews make clear that 35 years on, the two remain on distant, untouching planes.  The rift is so hard that Blondeau needed to use a fake name to gain access to the Tribeca Film Festival (where ""Man on Wire"" made its US debut).

It is Blondeau's involvement and post-WTC reaction - not Petit's crossing - that will stay with me long after my remembrance of this film fades.

Marsh's film gains additional poignancy by focusing on the early-70s  construction of the Twin Towers.  It's hard not to get wistful and misty watching the workers hoisting the now-famous building skins into place.",1245024000,2,1243,5.03921568627451

3497563,4,B001BP3Z9G,"""Man on Wire"" touches the mind and the heart.  It's amazing.

However, I have one problem with the film -- a ""fault"" which I imagine may have been caused by its (probably minimal) stock-footage-licensing budget.  The film could have used more historical context regarding the general state of decay and implosion in which the city of New York and the USA found itself during the Nixon Resignation, the bankruptcy of New York City, and the late-1960s/early-1970s critique of the Twin Towers as bastions of over-the-top capitalism (which they would remain until 2001.)  Both NYC and the USA were hurting in 1974.  But Petit's (a Frenchman's) unexpected, (and, thankfully, successful) highwire performance did a service to the Twin Towers by promoting and humanizing them, and to New York City and to the USA by re-emphasizing the the spirit of risk, initiative, and freedom that animated the Towers and that animates the United States.",1243900800,,933,5.1118421052631575

Contemparary interviews with the particpants adds enormously to the film, and the emotion that some of them still feel to this day is quite surprising and moving. The idea for the walk first formed in Petit's mind when he saw a newspaper article about the towers before they were built. Years passed before planning could start but eventually the detail fell into place.

There is a lot of original footage in the documentary, as well as reconstructions and material from his earlier walks on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and others.

Anyway, a few months ago, I heard a movie reviewer saying that one of his favorite films of '08 was the documentary Man on Wire.  Well, I had to see it, and I was not disappointed.  I am buying Petit's book, as well.  The entire feat, start to finish, just blows my mind, especially the dedication and participation of these other people in his life.  They, too, walked on the wire.",1242604800,,508,4.185567010309279
3497568,4,B001BP3Z9G,"I vaguely remember the story about the high wire acrobat who walked betweeen the tops of the Twin Towers.  I was only slightly aware of those buildings back then.  Up to that point, the Empire State Building was the tallest structure in my lifetime.  I had long forgotten about this amazing feat until I saw that a video was recently put together about the event.

""Man on Wire"" does a good job of giving the background of Philippe Petite with footage of some of his other traffic-stopping stunts.  We come to understand that Petite can't just waltz into a public (or private) structure, set up his wire and do his thing.  There are laws against such death defying acts (and these certainly fit that descriptive definition).  Thus we also get an in-depth account of the secret plans to elude the authorities in order to enable the event to become a reality.  This part of the film, somewhat lengthy in its' telling, comes across like a Cold War spy movie.  Petite has an interesting cast of co-conspiritors and they each have their opportunity to tell their perspectives and recollections.

Ultimately, the film delivers the amazing footage of a man who takes a stroll in the most incredible circumstances.  I had to hold onto my couch just watching it.  The postscript was a bit long even adding a gratuitous recreation of an amorous encounter with a celebrity groupie.  I guess my ""4 Star"" rating is based on the 10-15 minutes that ought to have been editted out of this final copy.

3497570,1,B001BP3Z9G,"This movie and the accompanying cartoon set out to show the amazing achievement of a brilliant artist and thereby give us peons some beauty and genius in our sad little grey lives.  Oh how we should thank people like Petit for what they bring to the world.  Bah! Humbug!

What did Petit do.  He strung 450 pounds of cabling across the towers, and walked across it with a 55 pound balance bar.  The cabling almost fell off the roof at night.  How much damage could 450 pounds of 3/4 inch steel cable do to a pedestrian after falling 450 meters (1/4) miles? or the balance pole? or Petit himself?  The film maker never asked Petit what he thought of the risk that his stunt posed to others.  Why?  It seems like a pretty fundamental question: ""Why were you willing to possibly kill innocent people for your beliefs?""  Were the terrorists that knocked the buildings down artists as well?  Merely by doing the stunt he shows his complete dis-regard for the safety of others.  Imagine if your wife or daughter or husband or son died because some egomaniac was stringing up 450 pound of cable on one of the tallest buildings in the world.  His walk wouldn't be nearly so magical then would it?

It is tiresome listening to Petit and his dupes wax on and on about how beautiful and magnificent and artistic his walk was.  I'm sorry, but tightrope walking is a novelty, barely above a joke.  It's like juggling or unicycle riding or competitive Yo-Yoing.  You know something you might look at for 5 minutes, think 'that's different' and then totally forget about.  So I don't know why doing it between the two towers is such an achievement.  Because he risked his life?  Well then lets venerate Russian roulette and car surfing as wonderful artistic activities.  And if public safety doesn't matter, then let's all praise the artistry of street racers and terrorist plane hijackers.

No, this movie missed the boat.  The real subject here is not the act itself and it's artistry, but rather Petit's psychology and the psychology of the people that followed him.  Narcissists are nothing new.  Their charm and grandiose self-aggrandizement and insatiable need for adulation and acclaim suck people in, including those who rave about this guy.

Leaving aside the fact that he put other's lives in danger, he did hurt people.  Once he got famous he dropped the people who helped him, slept with the first groupie, and told his GF bye-bye.  One guy in the movie cry when he thought about the end of the relationship even though it was 33 years after the fact.  So he pretty much used people as long as they were useful and then he's done with them.  Typical narcissistic using behaviour.  Others are seen as tools and when your done with them, well who cares.

Anyway, the fact that there are legions of people willing lionize such a pathetic attention seeking megalomaniacal user as Petit says to me that we as a society are pretty ignorant of narcissism.  And as such, those with that kind of personality will have plenty of willing fodder for their morally bereft grandiosities.  There will be more Bernard Madoffs, no doubt.",1240790400,35,3116,4.6987060998151575

It starts off exciting, the young boy finds a newspaper article about towers being built in the US. the viewer falls in love with this adventurous young man, and roots for him to succeed in his elaborate plan.
there's plenty of play-acting to enhance the tense moments when they were *almost* caught etc. but when it finally gets to the climax of the story, the actual deed, the walking of the tight-rope... the story just dies. After all those preparations, all you see is a few seconds of the tight-rope footage!
It seemed like the film makers just wanted to end the story quickly. they didn't show the viewer anything after the final success of the great ""caper"", just a quick sex scene which was totally not in place, and then a few words from the abandoned friends.
It was disappointing in such a big way because throughout the documentary everything was so detailed, while the end, which was supposed to be the most exciting, was just so rushed, so unexciting, a non story.",1240704000,21,1110,4.582914572864322
3497572,5,B001BP3Z9G,"The word aristocracy comes from ancient greek ""ariston"", meaning ""the best"". It contains the Indo-European root ""ar"". The same root appears in the latin (and Lithuanian) words ""ara"" - altar - and ""aratrum"" - plow. Hence, civilization (that is the offspring of agriculture), spirit, and aristocracy. ""Ar"" also appears in sanscrit ""Arya"", ""the nobles"", who spread in the gangetic plane and documented their religion in the Vedic texts. Precisely their Vedas teach the meaning of action separated by its consequences. They teach to act not because of the outcome of action, but because of its significance. Because the action itself calls the noble into acting.

Strange, isn't it?  This simple philological analysis, as well as a distracted look at any european mythology or at the life of illustrious romans, seems to suggest that civilization (""aratrum"") did not come  from utilitarianism, from the carefully planned, greedy action, sharpened to optimize its consequences. Paradoxically, the founders of our civilization unconsciously believed it came from the generous action that had a value in itself, whatever the consequences: noble, great gestures. As if only that action could renovate the spirit and the universe. Action as a sacrifice to the gods, in the Bhagavad Gita. Action as the altar (""ara"") on which the best ones (""aristoi"", ""arya"") could sacrifice.

I felt this sentiment reverberating over and over in this magnificent documentary, a true hymn to the meaning of nobility. I found it a powerful antidote to the lack of meaning, the greediness, the smallness of our world. Everybody witnessing the event or participating in it was deeply touched. While remembering it, many cried.

In the action without apparent meaning, true meaning is found. In the calculating, greedy pettiness, meaning is lost. This is where we came from. From this we have fallen. One of Petit's quotes should be carved in stone ""I had just done this incredible, impossible, magnificent gesture, and the only thing they could give me was this very american, very utilitarian *why, why, why?*.

The movie never mentions the 2001 attack that destroyed the towers but that is always in your mind and gives the movie some additional poignancy.
We meet Petit, who is articulate and almost laughably French. He had already walked on a wire between the two spires of Notre Dame in Paris and on a bridge in Sydney. He was apparently obsessed by the idea of walking between the twin towers from the moment construction on them began.
Why is the event interesting enough to deserve to be remembered? Like all theater, it was fleeting and transitory, yet it created an image of beauty that those who witnessed it never forgot.
From the grim aftermath, we know that the towers themselves were transitory. Like twin Towers of Babel, they aspired to touch the sky and yet they were so easily destroyed by those evil men.
And I guess it teaches us that everything we create and build and achieve, no matter how grandiose and significant it may seem, is transitory in this world of ours.
According to the movie, the event changed Petit in some fundamental way. For a short time, he became a star. He broke up with his girlfriend and his relationships with his loyal helpers also ruptured. I wish the movie had delved more into the aftermath. One extra included on the Dvd is an animated version of the story intended for children. It's almost more moving and resonant that the movie itself.

3497581,5,B001BP3Z9G,"James Marsh has created a documentary that pays homage to the early masters of the form and one that will stand on its own for generations to come.

  It is the story of Phillipe Petit, a self-talk tightrope or wire walker, street performer, publicity hound and obsessive who captured the world's attention in 1976 when he, with the help of interesting band of confederates, walked a wire strung between the newly erected World Trade Center towers.

  More than a thousand feet in the air, Petit walked the 200 feet or so between the towers on a quarter-inch thick wire eight times. On occasion he kneeled in salute. He lay down on the wire. He did this all with supreme ease, while onlookers gasped in surprise, shock, awe and fear.

  James Marsh pulls together Petit himself, looking vastly older now than the cherubic youth who pulled off this stunt, his girlfriend of the time whom the years have not treated well and several other friends, acquaintances and confederates.

  It is a marvelous story. Petit leaves no doubt that he is an obsessive - and watching his skills mature leaves one in awe of his incredibly singular talent. His girlfriend of so long ago lived in thrall to him, doing his ever bidding. She's quite the contrast - the young woman dressed in the style of the 60s and 70s compared to the much older woman of today, showing the ravages of age.

  Petit's friends of long standing all attest to the combustibility of Petit and their own tempers.

  The stories of the past are intertwined with the meticulous planning for the WTC escapade, which Marsh successfully imbues with the tension of a great bank heist film. The stories of creeping up to the top floor and then scurrying when a guard unexpectedly appears and leans on the tarp they are hiding under are wonderful.

  Finally the great event. Footage from the day just leaves the viewer gasping. Mere mortals don't do things like this - walk on a thin wire more than a thousand feet above our heads, kneeling on the wire, laying on the wire.

  A police officer, long forgotten to history, lives on in a news interview of the time, his hairstyle so 70s, so retro today, as he talks of the police reaction.

  No one treated it as a great crime, though the police officers, angry about being taunted by Petit, did rough him up.

  A judge ""sentenced"" Petit to a public performance for children. The WTC gave Petit a lifetime pass to the observation deck of the WTC.

  Petit faded into semi-obscurity, teaching and performing in New York.

  This film, however, assures that future generations will know and see the ""man on wire"", as the police complaint describes the event. Petit did something that no other human has done - and that no other human can ever do.

  A marvelous film. A tribute to Petite, the ""man on wire"" and Marsh, a superb documentarian.

What easily could have been a average 30 minute film is instead a riveting documentary that deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Documentary.

Having a fear of heights, there were pictures and video of Petit's exploits that were absolutely harrowing.  The story of how Petit and his helpers were able to get all their equipment in place and their ingenuity in stringing a steel wire between the two towers is unbelievable.  The historical footage of the WTC and surrounding area along with Petit's walk are worth watching.  However, when you put that together with the story of how they could accomplish this feat -- all the little things that had to and did go right -- and the interviews with key players, you have a brilliant picture.

It is a valuable lesson about what an intelligent, courageous, disciplined hard and smart  work with a purpose can achieve. This is the answer to the criticism that walking on a high wire has no benefit to the welfare of society. The benefit to society is to teach a lesson about the potential capability of the human being in a society where too many people think they are inadequate and live life without setting any goals. This is the same lesson given by the achievements of climbers of the Everest summit.

In the film you can see how  Phillipe Petit dreamed, planned and achieved his goal to walk between the twin towers in New York in 1974, that were subsequently brought down on September 11th 2001 by terrorist plane crashes. He set this goal even before the twin towers' construction began. He walked on the wire on lower heights for many years such as on the Sydney Harbor Bridge and many other places in the world for many years before eventually walking on the wire between the twin towers of New York. He had a supporting team of friends who tried to talk him out of the twin towers project fearing that he would fall. Despite this he kept his persistence. In the film we see that the team put up the wire between the twin towers after midnight so that they would not get caught. Even setting up that wire was very difficult. When dawn broke they had slept very little, even the walker Phillipe Petit. His friends were anxious that without a good night sleep and rest he would be too exhausted to keep his balance on the wire and made a last attempt to persuade him to give up the idea. He did not change his mind. It is remarkable that he spent 45 minutes on the wire, going back and forth between the towers 8 times as the crowd below and the police that came onto the towers to arrest him watched him. He didn't just walk ; he lyed on the wire like on a bed, balanced on his knee etc. When he came off the wire he was arrested and taken to psychiatric examination for insanity. He was found to be perfectly sane and charges against him of trespassing etc. were dismissed.

The only downside to the film is that a few of the scenes have low picture quality and some of the interviews made by the walker and members of the team are sometimes a little boring. However, some viewers of the film may not find the interviews boring.",1237161600,,2433,4.34065934065934
3497585,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Man On Wire documents Philippe Petit's quest to become a tightrope walker beyond comparison. The cinematography is very well done. In addition, we get lots of quality archival color footage and we also get very recent interviews with people who helped Philippe even when they didn't always see eye to eye with him. His girlfriend at the time, who provided Philippe with so much moral support, is also interviewed.

Although we don't get much in the way of background about Philippe Petit; we are told he was brought up in a strict household and he's essentially a rebel, going around the streets of Paris juggling balls and doing magic tricks on a unicycle. Philippe is obviously a brave man and he was very strong physically and emotionally as he prepared for the challenge of walking the tightrope between The World Trade Center buildings. Philippe also recruited a crew of friends, including his then-girlfriend; and together they all embarked on their mission to help Philippe prepare for his big goal of walking on a tightrope between what was then called ""The Twin Towers.""

We see footage of Philippe walking in a field on a tightrope and he learns how to do it very well rather quickly--good for him! He eventually became so good at this that he could even do it with his eyes closed. Incredible. He then scaled the towers of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris; and he also walked a tightrope on top of a bridge in the harbor of Sydney, Australia much to the chagrin of the police. It's interesting to note, however, that Philippe gave the police a run for their money without ever committing a serious crime.

And then came the preparations for the grand achievement--walking a tightrope between ""The Twin Towers."" Philippe and his friends prepared meticulously back in France by making small scale models of the tops of the two buildings and making numerous drawings of the scenario in order to study it from every possible angle. They didn't leave a thing to chance especially because Philippe's desire to walk that tightrope was so risky in and of itself. They even swayed the tightrope while Philippe practiced so that he could get used to walking on a swaying tightrope when the two buildings if any wind was blowing on the day he was going to do walk that tightrope.

One extremely interesting part of the adventure was actually conning their way into the Twin Towers to take pictures from which they could study--and prepare the tightrope the night before so that Philippe can walk early one morning in August of 1974. We see how they got in to study the buildings and how they eventually entered for the big event. I'll let you watch the film to see how they managed all this--on several occasions, too!

What happens to Philippe after he starts to cross the tightrope and the police show up? Will he get off the rope right away? Will his accomplishment change his relationships with his friends and his girlfriend? Does he ever do this or anything like it again? Watch the movie and find out!

The DVD comes with a few extras. There is a retelling of this true story for children entitled The Man Who Walked Between The Towers; and there is another interview with Philippe Petit as well. We even get a featurette about Philippe's experiences in Sydney back in 1973.

Man On Wire tells the fascinating tale of a once in a lifetime event--that of a brave man walking a tightrope between ""The Twin Towers."" However, on a broader scale this film is really about the importance of acting now to fulfill our dreams and achieve our goals. Only then can we savor life. The interviews we get are pretty incredible. I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys documentaries or films about the importance of living life to the fullest.",1236729600,,3748,4.7129770992366415

3497587,5,B001BP3Z9G,"A delightful, quixotic documentary about a dreamer who wanted to walk on a tightrope between the World Trade Towers and had enough skill to actually bring off the unlikely feat.

Along with his tightrope talent Philippe Petit had resourcefulness and considerable engineering ability. He smuggled more than a ton of equipment into the Towers under the noses of the guards, and rigged the wire by sending an arrow from one tower to the other and embroidering the wire from the fishline. His plan for the guywires was complex, and had to be, given the possibilities of wind and other problems at the top of the buildings.

During the planning stages the filmmakers use the lovers' theme from Michael Nyman's music for ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"". When Philippe is actually on the wire between the towers, they switch to Satie's ""Gymnopdie"". Then, as the camera pans from Philippe to the New York cops, the hectic march from ""The Cook The Thief"" takes over.

The sense of exultation and awe is contagious as Philippe's girlfriend tells the passersby that there is a man on a tightrope between the towers. Philippe's friends can't talk about the miraculous ascension without weeping. There is, indeed, something magical about the enormity of his dream and his accomplishment. I had a lump in my throat at the critical moment.

Predictably, the authorities and the media asked him ""Why?"" He found the question incomprehensible and irrelevant. A commitment like his doesn't have or need a ""Why.""

The entire project, from dream to planning to execution to arrest, could be regarded as a work of modern art, performance art, carried out with technological means but -- most of all -- a romantic end.

A great movie for dreamers and those who respect dreamers. Even one of the cops says, ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.""",1236211200,,1834,4.9
3497588,5,B001BP3Z9G,"Immensely entertaining documentary about Philippe Petit, a kind of ""performance terrorist"", who instead of plotting to destroy the world's most famous buildings and monuments, performs on them via his high wire act.  ""Man on Wire"" recounts his most famous stunt: sneaking into the newly-built World Trade Center in 1974, stringing a wire between the two towers, and performing an elegant high-wire act for almost an hour before being hauled off by police.  His eventual punishment? He had to perform his juggling and high wire act for New York's children in free performances in Central Park.  So even the authorities weren't too peeved with Mr. Petit for his memorable crime.

Cleverly filmed in the style of a heist movie, ""Man on Wire"" moves along at a nice clip, featuring a variety of interviews with Mr. Petit and his compatriots intercut with tense re-enactments of the infiltration of the World Trade Center on that memorable day in 1974.  What's also graceul about the film is that it never mentions the horrible events of September 11, 2001, but by including material about the construction of the towers and what they symbolized at the time, the film also subtly functions as a memorial to their passing.

Extra features include a 20-minute featurette about a similar stunt Mr. Petit successfully pulled off in Australia about a year before the World Trade Center event; a 12-minute interview with Mr. Petit that seems to have been conducted after the film wrapped (as he discusses at length his impressions of the movie); and- most impressively- a nine-minute animated film that recounts Mr. Petit's World Trade Center adventure in a wonderful storybook-style aimed at children.  This short cartoon is very well done.

Absolutely recommended for documentary fans, ""Man on Wire"" will also be immensely entertaining for those who only occasionally delve into the non-fiction filmmaking genre.  One can easily see why it won the Academy Award for Best Feature-Length Documentary Film on February 22, 2009.",1235347200,4,2014,5.153374233128834
3497589,3,B001BP3Z9G,"The phrase ""the book was better"" has been utilized by bookworms to annoy movie buffs for years, and in the case of Man on Wire, there is no better line than to balance one's judgment upon.

Petit's large book ""Up In The Clouds"" (not Man on Wire) was a testament to the artistic pursuit.  The expansive duration of his ""project"" spanning almost half a dozen years, read like a rollercoaster ride, soaring in inspiration at one moment, plunging into depression, but steadily gaining momentum.  When he and his accomplice Jean Francois had to sit motionless under a tarp for hours to evade security guards on the night before his faithful walk, the excruciating event was expertly documented in the book.  In Man on a Wire, director Jame Marsh intercuts the long hours with flashbacks and interviews, almost exempting the viewer from the taut suspense that creates the tension in Petit's high wire story.

You will miss, for example, Petit's rebellious, anti-authoritarian childhood in France, the proposal from Dustin Hoffman in NYC, Petit's incessant arguments with Jean Louis, the people who pull out of the project and disappointed Philippe (but whom he, nevertheless, thanked), betrayals from people the moment the walk was completed, a quick victory hop in the sack with an anonymous fan, Petit's refusal to endorse advertisements and commercials in the wake of his success, but also his generosity in offering to walk again if a tower (or towers) should be erected in the place of WTC.  You will also miss the beautiful 1902 story of the collapse of the San Marco tower, which Petit shares in the afterword as solace for the events of 9/11.

What the movie does offer is COLOR.  To Reach the Clouds is in a black and white format, meaning all photographs are in B/W.  Man of Wire offers color versions of some of those photographs and whimsical footage of early days leading up to the walk.  Silent-film style clips of tall-hatted Petit moving through the streets in his unicycle is also a humorous treat.

The delightful Jean Francois, always ready to come to his aid (as oppose to Jean Louise, always criticizing Petit like a mother hen) gets interviewed in present day as well.  His lovely manner is surely a testament to how good-natured people age gracefully.

If you are not a reader, then I gently suggest you begin this DVD by watching the extra ""interview with Phillipe Petit.""  In the 12 minute monologue from the man himself, you will get a taste of Petit's artistry and a sense of what his book 'Up In the Clouds' is about.  In addition, it could also be taken as a ""footnote/warning"" to the documentary itself.  Petit says:

""The film is not my film...I have my own film in my head...very precise...my film is very different than the film that James did.  James decided it is his vision, taken from my book 'To Reach The Clouds' He decided to give a lot of importance to the human feelings and the human drama, to the point that I think he manipulated a little bit - some of those interviews to make it more dramatic.  As you see there are many tears and many question marks of people seemingly torn by what they would like to express but are not able to or whatever.  This I have no comment, as this is not part of my adventure.  My adventure is a fairy tale of a young man falling in love with two towers.""

In the extras, there is also a 10 minute illustrated (color drawing) educational documentary for children and a film short documenting his earlier walk across the support pillars of the Sydney bridge.

The director should also be complimented on leaving footage and mention of 9/11 out of his film in order to capture and retain this good memory we possess of the Twin Towers.",1233792000,24,3703,4.671802773497689

Director James Marsh has crafted a fine film about the improbable passion of Philippe Petit that is instructive as well as entertaining.

3497593,4,B001BP3Z9G,"Evidently this film has an inspirational appeal to many who have seen it, judging from the glowing reviews, and I don't want to take away from that.  We all find inspiration in our own ways, but I have to admit that this film didn't strike me that way at all, and in fact, by the time the credits rolled, I wondered if the filmmakers meant it to have that sort of resonance or not.

I did enjoy the film for what it was - an examination of the event, and a glimpse into the feelings and emotions of those directly involved.  And I thought the archival footage of the tower's construction was especially riveting.  But I had a difficult time with Mr. Petit, and how his 'dream' swept up and carried away some of the people who were closest to him at the time, as if all their concerns were secondary to his wishes.

Now before I'm pilloried as a amorphous Philistine blob, I'll say that I'm sure that this isn't what Mr. Petit intended, and he probably couldn't have seen it as such at the time.  I'm sure he has regrets, as does anyone who lives life, though like most self-absorbed people, he has plenty of justification for his behavior too.  Of course, the only people to blame for getting carried away with his 'dream' are those that _let_ themselves be carried away with it.

I rented this movie based on the reviews and the critics, who hailed this movie with all sorts of superlatives, ranging from a masterpiece to a tour de force and on and on.  The problem is that I just can't see how risking one's life on a stunt is ennobling in any way.  Much like the man who dresses up as Spiderman and scales tall buildings, or even someone like Steve Fawcett, who's search and rescue effort eventually ended up costing the taxpayers of Nevada over 1.5 million dollars, Petit involved many people in a personal pursuit that added zero value to society.  Perhaps, if he had been so intent on risking his life, then a better livelihood would have been as a firefighter.  Then, if he wanted to inspire people, he could have joined ranks with the truly selfless who were an inspiration to all when the towers fell.

The filmmakers could have ended the movie after Mr. Petit completed his walk, with a cursory explanation of the aftermath, but instead they complete the picture by allowing the closest participants to describe the destruction of their personal relationship with Mr. Petit.  This is what leads me to feel that the filmmakers may have been fascinated by the event, but neutral about the man.

One other minor flaw of the DVD is the lack of closed captioning.  Several of the participants are French, and those who speak English have enough of an accent that CC would have helped distinguish some phrases.  Other than that, this is a well done documentary - of a man who carried love and friendship up to the top of two towers, and then dashed them to the ground.",1233532800,2,2872,4.502890173410405

The spellbinding documentary, ""Man on Wire,"" chronicles a very different kind of ""assault"" on the World Trade Center's Twin Towers from the one that happened on September 11th.  This earlier one involved a French tightrope walker named Philippe Petit who, on August 7, 1974, illegally crossed over from the South Tower to the North Tower (both still under construction at the time) on a wire suspended more than 1300 feet above the ground.  However, in this case, the ""attack"" was designed not to bring the buildings crashing down in a wanton display of death and destruction, but rather to celebrate them for the extraordinary feats of human engineering and achievement they clearly were.

Although director James Marsh deliberately avoids any mention of the 9/11 attacks, that earth-shattering event can't help but cast a haunting pall over the film anyway - like some unacknowledged ghost hovering above the project.  This is particularly the case in the early stretches of the film where we are shown grainy footage of the buildings as they were being constructed in the early 1970's.  In fact, we're jolted to find that the familiar debris-littered hole we're looking at is NOT a picture of Ground Zero but rather of the site that would serve as the foundation for the buildings.  Having witnessed the destructive end of the structures, we find it doubly poignant to be present once again at their hope-filled beginning.

But ""Man on Wire"" is not concerned with what happened to the buildings on September 11th, 2001, but rather what happened there on a misty day in August twenty-seven years earlier, when a man dazzled the world by seeming to defy the laws of gravity and of physics and, more strangely still, the code of self-preservation that rules all living creatures.  It's possible that we may never be able to fully understand what drives a man like Philippe Petit to do what he does, for even he admits flat-out that he can't define what it is that motivates him; all he knows is that he has some innate, obsessive need forging him on - some inner compulsion to live life constantly on the edge.  There's also the secondary thrill that comes with skirting the law in a way that doesn't do any real harm to others.  However, we're hardly in a position to criticize Petit for his vagueness, since our own undeniable fascination with those who routinely flirt with death can never be thoroughly explained either.  Marsh`s film plays with that fascination by taking us into Petit`s world and letting us see for ourselves how this amazing feat was finally accomplished.  Luckily, Petit and his crew recorded much of their preparations for it on film - with the director providing humorous, slightly surreal re-enactments shot in silhouetted black-and-white to fill in the blanks.

We're also fortunate in that most of the key players in the drama are still around today and more than willing to sit down and talk about their part in it.  This includes Petit himself who tries to put into words what was going through his mind at various stages of the project.  In addition, Marsh interviews others who either took an active part in engineering the stunt or who were in some way ancillary participants in the event.  What's interesting is how the fear of being caught by the authorities is almost as intense as the fear of Petit's falling to his death - a possibility that seems to register on most of them only at the point when he is about to venture out onto the rope.  Yet, throughout, there are those random moments of quiet contemplation when doubts, second thoughts and cold feet begin to worm their way, if only unconsciously, into the minds of  the people involved.

And when Petit is up there, teetering on a thread strung across the top of the world, we sit in dumbfounded silence at the sheer aesthetic beauty and balletic grace of what we are witnessing - and catch our breath at what feats of superhuman wonder we mere mortals are capable of achieving when we set our minds to it.  However, a little warning might be in order for the acrophobics in our midst:  you might just find yourself having to clutch the nearest available hand or armchair rest to steady your nerves through the ordeal.

""Man on Wire,"" inadvertently perhaps, turns out to be as much a tribute to the Twin Towers themselves - and, by extension, the people who lost their lives in them - as to the irrepressible, death-defying daredevil who did his bit to immortalize them.

So the photo alone puts me on the edge of my seat.  I thought James Marsh did a phenomenal job on this documentary. Thank you! The documentary is suspenseful, not only due to the vertiginous subject matter, but also the heist-like element of plotting the wire walk itself-- It's like watching Dassin's Rififi from the criminal element.  Anything could've gone wrong. Petit could've died. Accomplices arrested. All odds were against Philip, but he remained unstoppable in his vision, tenacious in his insistence that it could be done, AND HE DID IT!  It is a true story of perseverance, a focused mind and vision,  no matter how insane the idea is perceived. True genius! On a deeper level, I kept reflecting on the 9/11 hijackers, as I am sure many viewers will while watching this documentary, the difference is between Petit's innocence and only wanting to conquer the Twin Towers, to perform a stunt... not hurting anyone...  and how a century later another's evil intentions would obliterate them forever.

3497598,5,B001BP3Z9G,"This is a tale that goes way back to the months after I graduated high school in 1974 -- a young Frenchman named Phillipe Petit managed to string a rightwire between the nearly-completed towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Then, for an hour, he walked about danced across the rope -- a quarter of a mile in the sky -- above the heads of amazed New Yorkers and their less-amused constabulary.

""Man on Wire"" splices current interviews with film, video and still footage from the 1970s to tell the story. Petit is a dynamo -- a frenetic blend of pluck, skill and insanity who gathers around him a hodge-podge of volunteers who help him execute his art. This is a story of romance, careful planning, athletic excellence, technical skill, sleuthing and near escapes. It is utterly delightful to watch. Except, perhaps, for the fact that the sluthing was being done on the WTC, a building that was also surveilled by those with less artistic intents. This unavoidable sense of sadness and loss is not addressed directly in the film, but colors every frame. Some of Petit's still undimmed wildness seems misplaced given the context.

""Man on Wire"" is a beautiful film, with stunning photography taken by the gang that conquered the Twin Towers -- in a good way.

My Amazon comment title says that the film is too long. I think it is. While supportive footage of other crossings and Petit's friends is essential, there is too much of it. The extended length of the film does not add to the suspense of finally being on The Wire.

The Scholastic animated bonus feature on the dvd is a delight and in some ways better than the Man on Wire film.

3497600,5,B001BP3Z9G,"The title I gave my review of ""Man on Wire"" is a small capsule of the critical raves that have been heaped upon this documentary.  I just finished watching this documentary today, and I have to agree with the other critics who have raved about this movie. The movie documents Philippe Petit's six year struggle to achieve an illegal artistic act-walking on a tightrope between the two Twin Towers of New York city. Petit has a history of defying the law to perform his art, from walking above the towers of Notre Dame in his hometown of Paris to the bridge crossing of Sydney Harbour in Australia.  How he achieves it, up until he is finally in the air a quarter of a mile up on a tightrope between the Towers, is thrilling.  There is never any motivation other than thrill seeking behavior given for Petit's decision to walk between the towers. Petit and all of his ""partners in crime"" for this hedonistic, illegal artistic act are all interviewed and give their insights into what they did and what it meant.  This movie, despite the fact there is no film footage of Petit on the towers, will keep you riveted to your seat.

 The special features are good as well.  The footage of Philippe Petit's Sydney Harbor crossing (in Australia)is well done. I enjoyed the animated scholastic film of ""The Man who walked between the Towers,"" based on an award winning childrens book about Petit's walk across the Towers.  Mr. Petit's interview is also fascinating in providing insights into his behavior, and why he feels the need to perform outside of a circus on a highwire.

3497605,4,B001BP3Z9G,"One would think with a title like this we were discussing this week's blockbuster release, THE DARK KNIGHT. That's not the case. No, this week's film is a treat that flies under the headlamps of most moviegoers. Its a little film called MAN ON WIRE.

The film is a documentary about Philippe Petit, the wire walker who daringly crossed by wire from one building to the other of the World Trade Center back in 1974. Don't let the fact that it's a documentary scare you. The film is filled with tension, laughs, thrills and pure joy.

A young street performer, Philippe tells of how he went to the dentist one day and saw an article about the construction of the World Trade Center buildings. He knew then and there that he had to conquer them, that he had to walk from one to the other. With his goal in sight, it would be several years before he could fulfill that dream, mainly because the buildings weren't built yet.

We get to know Philippe and his friends through the interview footage of the film as they discuss the process that went in to planning and carrying out this daring maneuver. Footage shot while they made preparations is used as well as recreated scenes. It is put together well lending you a sense of being there as the plan moves forward.

In preparation for his fateful day, Philippe and crew journey to Australia where they tie off a line between two towers on top of a well traveled bridge. Creating a stir, as well as a catching the eyes of traveling motorists, it gives Philippe the first glimmer of hope that his dream might be possible.

The film changes from a look at his life and those of his cohorts to an almost caper type film. Rather than focus just on Philippe, though he is the centerpiece, we are brought into the fold as we watch them plan out just how to accomplish their goal.

They begin with the logistics of how to rig the cables from one tower to the other. It's not just a simple line from one building to the other, but a wire that will need to be anchored down to keep it taught while Philippe walks. Once the rigging is designed, its how to attach it.

Trips with espionage like quality are taken by Philippe to get shots of the rooftops. He checks out all angles in an attempt to decide just the right way to hook up the wire from one building to the other. Then it becomes a question of how to get the equipment to the rooftops.

Lastly, how will they get the cable from one building to the other? The uses of a bow and arrow with filament wire (which they have to rig to unspool properly) that will be used as a guide for their rope is tested until it works. Now all it takes is having the patience to get to the rooftops and make a go of it.

The film offers a joy for life in the essence of young Philippe as he overflows with enthusiasm for the task at hand. He not only wants to do this, he feels that he MUST do this. The thought of his falling never enters his mind until the time comes to cross.

The second most inspiring item of this film is the World Trade Center itself. Shown during construction, it is an eerie sight to see those famous panels from the front of the building being erected since the last time seen we saw them beneath a ton of rubble. Having lived through non-stop shots of the buildings falling, it was inspiring to watch as they were built from the ground up.

Shots of airplanes flying in the background while the building was going up make for an uneasy feeling as do animations of planes flying from France to New York. But in the end the love of the buildings by Philippe Petit shines through as does his love of life.

Called crazy by some, genius by others and artist by many, Philippe Petit will offer you an inspiring look into his life and times, his desire and inspiration. And in watching his tale, perhaps just a little bit of that magic will carry over from the screen to your heart.

You may find yourself looking at a figure flying over the streets of Gotham this week. But if you neglect the sight of a man somewhat soaring over the streets of the real life Gotham, then you're missing out on a treat.",1231804800,,4100,4.3022049286640724

Having climbed to the top of Notre Dame and studied the gargoyles, it was mesmorizing to see the photos of him ""suspended in air"" next to them.  How he was able to plan and execute his Twin Towers spectacle was fascinating.

I also think this video in a post 9/11 world was, in a way, an inadvertant tribute to the Twin Towers.  It made me sad to watch the footage and think that those towers are no longer there.  It made me mad to think how he was able to plan this complex stunt without being caught by any security at the Towers.  Which brings me to my criticism:  I think it was a glaring omission to not include in this documentary Petit's feelings about the fall of the towers.  This man dreamed of walking between the towers before they even were built - to not include his commentary on their destruction left me wanting more.

3497613,4,B001BP3Z9G,"What many considered ""the artistic crime of the century,"" French high-wire walker Philippe Petit did what today would be impossible (because they don't exist and because of security) by performing a tightrope walk between New York City's World Trade Center twin towers ...in 1974.

The feat itself isn't as interesting as the preparation and the history behind Philippe's successful walk. Having scaled between the arches at Notre Dame and the Harbor Bridge pillars in Sydney, Australia, Philippe's goal from early on was to walk on a wire much, much higher. At just over 1,350 above street level, the twin towers were his goal.

Friends and even workers within New York's buildings aided Philippe in surprising ways. Many backed out when they realized how close he was to actually doing it, worried that if he fell to his death they would be partially responsible.

But nothing was going to hold Philippe back. Security guards, wind, fog and fearful friends all plagued his attempt ...to no avail.

As stated earlier, the preparation was fascinating, showing the documentary watcher the tensile strength needed to span the buildings, the bypassing of security guards, and the near failure of the entire episode because of a severe sagging of the wire during its initial deployment. The tense nature of how the story unfolded was pretty phenomenal. Looking up from the ground at Philippe as he walked the wire was simply awe-inspiring; he looked like a speck against the higher clouds.

Arrested after his successful walk, the words ""Man on wire"" appeared on the violation written up  by the New York P.D., which is where the film gained its title. But the film is much more than a simple man doing a tightrope walk. It's a historical recounting of one man's goal to achieve what seemed unachievable.

It is strange to see a man doing something artistically dangerous -- and illegal -- on things that no longer exists. Perhaps that added to my enjoyment of the documentary. After watching the horribleness of 9/11 time and time again, it was unique and refreshing to see something being done to the towers of a quaint and beautiful nature. Something that many Americans probably have trouble attributing to the twin towers now. Which is why you should watch this.

Thank you, Philippe.",1230854400,5,2285,4.963350785340314
3497614,5,B001BP3Z9G,"""Man on Wire"" explores the execution and experience of one of the world's most famous artistic spectacles. Philippe Petit's wirewalk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on August 7, 1974. When he was 17 years old, Petit read an article about plans for the World Trade Center in New York that inspired the dream that would take 6 1/2 years to realize. James Marsh's film intertwines three threads as it builds toward its climax. It offers a blow-by-blow account of the dramatic feat that played out on August 6-7; it follows the construction of the Towers, seemingly built just for Philippe's ambitions; and it takes us through the years of preparation by Philippe and his accomplices.  There are recent interviews, archival footage of Philippe's team, and a moody black-and-white reenactment of the events that unfold as the participants recount their experiences.

This is a competent documentary about an amazing feat of daring and artistry. It's serious in its intensity while embracing humor as well, and the preparation in France and New York is entertaining. But the film's ability to capture the passion and dedication that motivated Philippe Petit make it a great documentary, not just a good one. He's a man with a real lust for life, apparently completely free of neuroses, which he expresses through performance, particularly on the high wire. He might be the only wirewalker in the past 50 years who does not confine his art to the circus. I think the rest are afraid of going splat. Philippe Petit isn't, and, by the end of this film, we understand why. That's its great accomplishment. Philippe is 60 years old, still remarkably youthful and as passionate as he was at 25, so his interviews are terrific.

Director James Marsh emphasizes the human drama through the perspective of Philippe's accomplices, while Philippe's own point of view is more one of concentration and glee. Four men ascended the Towers and rigged the wire after months of scouting the site: Philippe and Jean-Francois Heckel on the roof of the South Tower, Jean-Louis Blondeau and American Alan Welner on the North Tower. Jean-Louis was the only one of the team that planned the walk, apart from Philippe, who stuck with the project, the others having abandoned it for fear it would mean Philippe's death. And Jean-Louis said it was the worst wire he had ever rigged. These men are interviewed, along with those who participated in the preparation, including Philippe's then-girlfriend Annie Allix. In sum, this is an awe-inspiring account of an great feat of diligence and faith. In English and French with subtitles.

The DVD (Magnolia 2008): ""Sydney Harbour Bridge Crossing 1973"" (20 min) is a short documentary by James Ricketson about Philippe Petit's preparation and execution of his wirewalk between the pylons of the Australian bridge, aided by Mark Lewis, who recounts his role in the feat. ""Philippe Petit Interview"" (13 min) is a long but interesting interview in which Petit talks about his passion for wirewalking, his approach to life, and what it all means to him. ""The Man Who Walked Between the Towers"" (10 min) is an animated film for children that recounts the story of the Twin Towers walk. There are optional Spanish subtitles for the feature film. The English subtitles are not optional.",1230768000,,3309,5.0
3497615,5,B001BP3Z9G,"I'm not so sure I'd rate it the best film of 2008, but ""Man on Wire"" is an exceptionally well-made documentary about the achievement of a high-wire artist, who dreams of crossing the Twin Towers on a wire even before ""they're there"" (ironically, because of dreamers not totally unlike the film's protagonist they're again ""not there"").  Despite his last name, the Frenchman, Phillippe Petit, thinks ""big"" and is not afraid to risk it all (though spectators suffering from acrophobia may occasionally wish not to risk viewing the screen).  And in the end, we see him not only as an accomplished daredevil but a genuine artist, someone impossible not to admire and be drawn to.

The film is tight and laconic, avoiding excessive dialog and exposition in favor of making the spectator a participant in trying to figure out what drives someone like Petit.

But the film also, upon reflection, allows us to speculate seriously about the role of the friends and associates without whom the grandiose projects of a Phillippe Petit would literally never get off the ground. The early, non-reconstructed  documentary footage is highly professional, obviously filmed by someone who has been directed with great care by the subject being filmed.  (Clearly, this man had a sense of theater long before his greatest role.)  During the recent footage reconstructing the 1974 episode, the handheld camera is quite animated whenever it's trained on Petit, as if to suggest that he alone is alive, heroic, colorful.  By contrast, the camera is rock steady when focusing on the assistants who made possible Petit's publicized feat, making them more wooden and less human.  In the ""Special Features,"" we witness a very articulate and ""theatrical"" Petit talking about his achievement, confirming suspicions some viewers may have picked up while puzzling out his character in the film.

The most telling shot in the entire film is that of an accomplice who, while attempting to describe his feelings after the stunt's success, erupts into tears.  A charitable interpretation is that he was so moved to be part of this earth-shaking drama that words fail him.  But close attention to the scene brings out the tension underlying the film's story: the heroic, romantic, individualistic artist vs. the collective, the social, the very real audience and supporters without whom his mission would be meaningless and even impossible.

Petit, besides being an artist, is also a supreme ""con artist,"" possessing such compelling ""rhetoric of character"" in the service of his idealistic dreams that he proves difficult to resist.  But once the daring, complex, challenging adventure has been pulled off, who gets all of the credit?  In fact, he might be seen to ""take"" it quite eagerly--and, through a cleverly-filmed slapstick sex scene, narcissistically.

And what if Petit had failed?  Who then, even if only by association and implication, is left to live with the blame of an unnecessary death?  Those emotions ultimately prove more powerful than the surge of admiration for the accomplishment of yet another hero-artist, be he Evel Knieval, Phillippe Petit, or a rock star living on the edge.  We were attracted to him in part by the element of danger, but did we fully understand the other half of it?

Even as we question the ability of a Manson, Koresh, or Jim Jones to influence and control minds, some of us may have questioned our own susceptibility to the undeniable if not irresistible charm of megalomaniacal personalities who seem all too capable of making instant ""yes men"" of us at any moment.  It is these viewers for whom this film is likely to connect in more  ways than one, providing a fascinating documentary of a heroic romantic figure while affording a penetrating glimpse of the ""ordinary"" but devoted onlookers whose own sacrifices make possible and may even exceed the hero's.",1230768000,8,3873,5.075709779179811
3497616,4,B001BP3Z9G,"When asked why he climbed Mt. Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary reportedly replied, ""Because it's there.""  Perhaps the same reply is apropos of Philippe Petit in his magnificent obsession to traverse the yawning chasm between the twin towers of the World Trade Center via tightrope.

""Man on Wire"" traces the daunting logistics and team effort needed to prepare for the tightrope walk, and the many challenges that nearly fragmented the effort.  The film's climax is the breathtaking high wire walk, set to the accompaniment of Erik Satie's ""Gymnopedia"", a beautiful blend of music and image that carries viewers to the heights.

That we now know the grim fate of those twin towers 30+ years later lends added poignancy to the memory of the structure's construction and the creative impulse it inspired in others.  In Petit, it inspired a creative yet defiant act of performance art that had no genuine ""why.""  To madmen who hijacked airplanes and the plotters who sent them and others to their death, the twin towers inspired hatred of all that the West symbolized to them.

Philippe Petit became a man on wire to defy convention, to assert his uniqueness and to do something lyrical just for the hell of it.

3497617,5,B001BP3Z9G,"In an era of brilliant documentaries, this one rises to the surface.  Cream of the crop. Miraculously, M. Petit had decided to film his progress and practice as a young man, so we see not only photos and current interviews, but lengthy sections of original footage.  It was absolutely captivating to see not only the high wire shots, but to see Paris and New York in the 1970s.  As a 40-something who first came to know Paris and New York in this era, it was beyond satisfying to see honest footage of the places I love. The clothes, the hair, the people, the freedom, the attitude -- it left me so homesick for a time gone by.  The interviews are intelligent, sensitive, and utterly heartbreaking.  If you dare to watch this, be prepared to be pulled in, and to have this film -- and this man -- on your mind for many days afterward.",1228953600,8,834,4.3896103896103895
3497618,5,B001BP3Z9G,"I'm still trying to digest the enormity of this amazing fete!  Watching Petit from the ground, he looks little more than a speck.  It's almost hard to believe that this actually happened.

This film gives us a lot---first the sheer spectacle of the event. That would be enough reason to watch it.  But it does a lot more.  I loved the early films of the young Petit and his friends romping in the green grass of the south of France as they prepared for the performance.  The spirit of innocence and joy as they plan to do the impossible is really nice to see.

Then there is the inspiration that many may draw from the film--that nothing is impossible if you believe in your dream and are willing to work very hard to bring it into reality.  The film does not stint on showing the exhausting preparative work that went into making this happen.

There's a real transcendent aspect to this, too.  Petit says that death is very near when he's doing this.  He says that if he should die on this attempt that it would be beautiful to go while doing what one is passionate about.  He talks a lot about living on the edge, each day..and there is a lot of inspiration one can draw from that.  The one moment that struck me the most in the whole film was after he overcame his initial fear on the crossing and a smile broke out on his face.  As his companions said, they knew that he was home free then....he was in the zone...and his incredible antics on the wire at that time are truly mind boggling.

Then, there is the mystery aspect---the fact that the deal is illegal gives the story a bigger emotional charge than it would have anyway. It's really fun to see the figures huddled beneath the tarp while the guard smokes his cigarette a few feet away.  A lot of folks will cheer the fact that these kids were able to pull it off.

Then there is the dimension of the relationships of his ""team members"" to Petit.  He is obviously a charismatic guy whose passion for his dream enlisted blind faith in his friends.  What is touching and also sad is the way the friendships, including that of his long time lover, ended after his great triumph.  The film doesn't neglect this aspect of the story, although he doesn't hit us over the head with it either.  As another reviewer said, it's important to see what such one-pointed ambition can cost in terms of one's overall humanity.

All in all, it's a very satisfying picture of one man's amazing experience---really worth watching.

One has to wonder how Petit reacted at the events of 9-11!  Given his nature, he would have had to taken it very personally.",1228867200,,2597,4.441860465116279
3497619,5,B001BP3Z9G,"It was during the summer of 2000, roughly a year before 9/11 that i was a tourist at the world trade centre and went to the top and could see the sheer magnificence of man's creativity and sense of urban architecture at its finest moment. I also suffer from a mild fear of heights, so when we went on the top, i was almost gripping the railing (even though its on a separate protective structure) for dear life, but after awhile once my senses adjusted to the height. I was blown apart by the view and the whole largesse of the situation. but i digress..

It is without a doubt an act of sheer lunacy that a person would actually have the gall to tightrope walk across the towers, from my memory of my tour up there, the very notion is mind boggling to say the least.

The documentary itself is a carefully and efficiently prepared sequence of re-enactments and collages of photos with certain video footage pertaining to network and news archives of those covering the story at that time. I have to admit, watching the documentary alone, i started feeling a bit dizzy :)

Its an amazing documentary that details how Phillipe meticulously planned the whole operation and his thoughts on the same on why it had to be done. He comes across as a person with such a passion and desire for life, love and happiness that its an inspiration just to see this documentary and how his totally insane act will change you and encourage you to go and truly live life.

3497620,5,B001BP3Z9G,"On the surface, Man on Wire may appear to be a straightforward documentary about an eccentric high wire artist who is either incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. But if you look closer, you might discover one of the best suspense thrillers/heist movies of 2008, although no guns are drawn and nothing gets stolen. It is also one of the most romantic films I've seen this year, although it is not a traditional love story. Existential and even a tad surreal at times, it is ultimately a deeply profound treatise on following your bliss.

Late in the summer of 1974, a diminutive Frenchman named Philippe Petit made a splash (of the figurative kind, luckily) by treating unsuspecting NYC morning commuters to the sight of a lifetime: a man taking a casual morning stroll across a "" steel cable, stretched from rooftop to rooftop between the two towers of the then-unfinished World Trade Center, 1350 feet skyward. After traversing the 200 foot wide chasm with supernatural ease, he decided to turn around and have another go. And another. And another. All told, Petit made 8 round trips, with only one brief but memorable rest stop. He took a breather to lie on his back (mid-wire) and enjoy what had to have been the ultimate Moment of Zen ever experienced in the history of humankind, contemplating the sky and enjoying a little chit-chat with a seagull.

Now, a stunt like this doesn't just happen on a whim. There are a few logistical hurdles to consider beforehand. Like how do you transport 450 lbs of steel cable to the roof of one tower of the World Trade Center, and then safely tether it across to its twin? A clandestine operation of this magnitude requires meticulous planning, and at least a couple trustworthy co-conspirators. Sounds like the makings of a classic heist film, no?

All of this potential for a cracking good true-life tale was not lost on director James Marsh, who enlisted the still spry and charmingly elfin Petit, along with a few members of his ""crew"" to give a first-hand account of events leading up to what can perhaps best be described as a ""performance art heist"". Marsh also deserves kudos for his excellent choice of music; the accompaniment of Peter Green's sublime, haunting guitar instrumental ""Albatross"" to one of Petit's more balletic high wire walks is an unexpected treat, making for a truly transcendent cinematic moment.

Of course, the foremost question on anyone's mind would be ""Why did he do it?"" At the time, he enigmatically offered ""When I see three oranges, I juggle; when I see two towers, I walk."" Petit himself remains a bit elusive on the motivations for his stunts. The director doesn't really push the issue, which I think is a wise choice. When you watch the mesmerizing footage of Petit floating on the air between the towers of Notre Dame, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and then ultimately the World Trade Center, you realize that it is simply an act of pure aesthetic grace, like a beautiful painting or an inspired melody. And you also suspect that he does it...because he can. That's impressive enough for me, because I can barely balance a checkbook, and when it comes to heights, I get a nosebleed from thick socks.",1228780800,104,3184,4.794171220400728
3497621,5,B001BP3Z9G,"When the charismatic and daring Frenchman Philipe Petit saw a drawing of the projected twin towers of the World Trade Center, he immediately knew.  Even though they had yet to be built, he knew that someday he would have to cross them.  This intense and exhilirating documentary aims to show us how and why.  The how is easier to tell.  Its effort to explore the why is what makes this documentary much more than merely exciting.  We all need a reason to live, a passion to drive us.  The greatest passions are those that push the limits of the conceivable.

In one of the opening scenes of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/dp/0521602610/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</a>, the would-be teacher arrives in a crowded marketplace to preach the possibility of the ""overman,"" the inventor of new values who would elevate humanity towards higher pursuits than merely pleasure and pain and the avoidance of death.  The crowd misunderstands him, thinking he refers to the tightrope artist who was to appear above them.

Watching this remarkable documentary, about Philipe Petit's criminal act of performance art, it would be hard not to see that he is no ordinary man.  It would be difficult not to see in his story possibilities for a life unconstrained by the merely pragmatic concerns of day-to-day living, that reaches out beyond the possible and accepts risk in order to achieve something truly remarkable.

Of course, as the film makes clear, Mr. Petit is by no means an ""overman"" -- he is remarkable and talented and charismatic but at the same time deeply flawed, notably in his seeming inability to see the immensity of the sacrifices that his friends (and lover) make for the sake of his visions.  While his crossing of the twin towers was astonishing and beautiful, it stunned me that just afterwards he could forget his friends (and lover) to pursue an amorous encounter with an admirer.  The film does not shy away from presenting his flaws, and perhaps the greatest strength of the film is to show how much his accomplishments depended on the skills and efforts of many collaborators.  It was a team project, and while the film strongly suggests that their friendships had become damaged or broken in the aftermath, it does give a strong voice to the perspectives of the many participants.

The film is edited brilliantly, combining actual footage and newsreel with interviews and re-enactments.  The filmmakers tell the story as if it were a heist film, meticulously portraying the complex preparations that were required, with the crossing as the final prize, and gradually lay in back story to add emotional depth and significance to the final event.  I found it to be at least as intense and entertaining as any fictional heist film I've ever seen -- and I've seen quite a few.  The pacing of the film is just right.

The music is perfect -- combining classical pieces with original compositions.  It was only on second viewing that I realized I'd heard some of the most intriguing music before, in the work of another brilliant British auteur, Peter Greenaway (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Draughtsman-s-Contract/dp/B000Y14U5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Draughtsman's Contract</a>, and Drowning by Numbers).  The film won top prizes at Sundance, where I had the chance to see it for the first time, taking both the Grand Jury prize and the Audience Choice award in the World Documentary category.  They were well deserved.  The film is both astonishing, complex and enormously entertaining -- and nicely gives a beautiful crime to remember in connection with the World Trade Center, as a counterpoint to the more recent atrocities.  This film is definitely not one to be missed.

""Man on Wire"" (98 min.) tells the improbable story of Phillipe Petit's dream (and eventual reality) of walking on a high wire between the two WTC buildings on August 7, 1974. The movie starts with his humble beginngins of being a street artist, eventually leading to his wanting to do high wire walks, starting with the Paris Notre Dame, then the Sidney Harbor, and then eventually the World Trade Center Towers. The movie does an excellent job building the excitement into what it took to eventually pull off that implossible event. All of the main players of the event are interviewed now more than 30 years after the event, and Philippe Petit turns out to be a master entertainer and story teller. When you are watching it all unvolve, you can't but help be in awe of it all. Just exilerating, period.

If this movie doesn't get serious consideration of being nominated for best documentary of 2008 at the Oscars, there is something terribly wrong with the entire system. This is one of the most enthralling movies I've seen this year, and I've seen a lot of movies.",1228521600,2,1264,4.6891891891891895
3497623,4,B001BP3Z9G,"While police sirens whine far below, this man looks from a towering skyscraper down at Gotham as he prepares to step into the abyss. He knows that what he will do is not legal, but thinks that it will benefit others. Even more, he is drawn -- by his very nature -- to act.
If you think I'm writing about Batman in The Dark Knight, well, I'm not (at least not just yet). I'm writing about Man on Wire, a documentary about tight rope walker and proto performance artist Philippe Petit, who wire walked between the tops of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in August of 1974.
Director James Marsh uses a combination of vintage footage, contemporary interviews and dramatic recreations to tell the story of how Petit dreamed up his mad scheme, recruited his motley band of helpers and circumvented security to bring his dangerous plan to fruition. In some ways, the film works as a caper or heist film wherein in a team is gathered to steal the jewels or break out of prison.
There is no mystery about whether he will be successful. After all, Petit is interviewed in the present day (so we know he lives), and no one would make a film about someone who wasn't able to pull off an elaborate stunt over thirty years ago. The fun is watching how it was done. But it can be a bit unsettling to watch as blueprints for the World Trade Centers are laid out to plot a stunt, when we know that in the years after 1974 the blueprints for the buildings will be studied for much more malignant reasons.
But as a Christian, I find it odd to be put in a place of rooting for someone who's breaking the law. In Romans 13: 1 & 2 the apostle Paul wrote ""1Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.""
Petit's comrades argue that since he has no ill intent, it doesn't matter if he breaks the law. In the film we are shown some of Petite's stunts prior to the WTC, tightrope walking between the towers of the Norte Dame Cathedral and the towers of the Sydney Harbor Bridge. After being arrested in Sydney, Petit swipes the watch of one of the policemen who arrests him.
I think when we're young we all have an impulse to break or at least bend the law. (I know as a kid and a teen, I might not have always strictly followed laws scrupulously concerning trespassing when with a friend off-roading or toilet papering houses or...the traffic laws or... how much of this do I want my kids to read?) And part of the fun of watching movies is seeing characters do what we would never do. But this is a real person committing a real crime that could have not only cost him his own life, but the lives of onlookers and the police called to bring him in.
And yet watching a man walk back and forth between those massive structures is captivating and at times quite beautiful. Can we become too obsessed with following legalities?
Jesus certainly was not always a stickler for the law. The Pharisaic law said that one should not do any work on the Sabbath, including healing. But we have this story about Jesus from Matthew 12 - ""9Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, 10and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, ""Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?""
11He said to them, ""If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? 12How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."" 13Then he said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.""
But there is a difference. When Jesus broke the law, it was always clearly for the glory of God, the benefit of others and the furtherance of the Kingdom. It wasn't just on a lark or for self glorification.
So back to Batman. Yes, I did see some similarities between these films. One of the most fascinating things in The Dark Knight (directed by Chris Nolan) is Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) wrestling with the outlaw nature of his work as a vigilante. He sees his work as necessary to protect the lives of others, but he would rather be able to live within the law. But he finds he can't.
In The Dark Knight, Wayne uses all the tools at his disposal to fight a war against crime and terrorism (as personified by the Mob and the Joker played by the late Heath Ledger). But he comes to realize there will be a cost to such a battle not just for himself, but for those who join him in the battle. And he agonizes over the potential costs in the lives of others. (Petit in Man on Wire rarely seems concerned by the costs paid by those who join him in his quest.)
These moral quandaries, never fully answered, are what make The Dark Knight a little more thoughtful that the average summer superhero epic. And it was odd to find that the fictional blockbuster was more serious on a moral level than the documentary from the BBC and Discovery Films.",1227916800,,5206,4.368041237113402
3497624,5,B001BP3Z9G,"I was lured into seeing this film by my teenage son, who is a circus acrobat by genetic conviction as surely as Philippe Petit was a high-wire walker and as I am a musician. I would never have entered the theater if I'd known what I'd be seeing. I have a pathologically empathetic response to films. When I was a little kid, I used to shout out warnings to Tweetie Bird when the cat got near. During fight scenes, my whole body twitches and my wife gets nervous for the safety of the unsuspecting head in front of me. I'm a climber in real life. I've been to the summit of Annapurna. But my blood pressure rises and I tremble with acrophobia at Hollywood simulations of climbing. This film Man on Wire took two years off my life, I'm sure. It's that intense, with its coy intersplicing of still photos and super-eight footage of Petit in mid-air and lovely slow talking-head interviews of Petit and his accomplices, years later, clearly establishing that they all survived to tell the tale.

Those interviews of middle-aged daredevils, reminiscing about their greatest caper, were as intense for me as the dodgy accomplishment of the adventure. It was literally the end of a love affair with life for all of them, something ""too hot not to cool down,"" an overture too overwhelming to be followed by a mere opera. When Petit's boyhood friend broke down in tears at the waning of their friendship, when Petit's wife-the-love-of-his-life felt the reality that his life no longer needed hers, the whole social cost of Petit's obsession moved me also almost to tears. Hey, I might have cried if my heart had slowed down to twice normal. I felt an urge to grab my son and hug or shake him, saying ""don't let your art be more to you than your life.""

There's more to this film than a mere victimless heist thriller.",1226361600,224,1808,4.577160493827161

ALSO READ PHILIPPE'S WONDERFUL BOOK; his story transcends words and transports you to a place of rare passion, beauty and possibility. Soaring! I remember this story just after it appeared in the New York Times back in 1974 and filed it away in my mind, wondering when the whole story might be told by the man who did it. Thank you Philippe for sharing your story with us in your own time. I look forward to meeting you some day...

3497626,5,B001BP3Z9G,"I saw this movie in a local theater about a month ago and I can't stop thinking about it.  It's a good, well constructed documentary film that uses some recreated scenes as well as current interviews and period film and photos.  The story of how Phillipe Petit planned and executed a tightrope walk between the twin towers is laid bare.  1350 feet in the air, 200 feet across.  It was hard to believe even as I watched it.  It seemed inspiring and insane all at once.  I don't know if he's courageous or crazy but I suspect the answer is both.

If this movie sounds the least bit interesting to you, go ahead and get it.  You won't be disappointed.  If I hadn't seen it on the last night of it's run at the theater I might have gone more than once.",1223337600,4,748,4.211267605633803
3497627,5,B001BP3Z9G,"This BBC documentary tells the story of how on August 4, 1974 Philippe Petit (b. 1949) danced, sat, knelt and lay down on a tight rope that was strung between the two towers of the World Trade Center. The stunt lasted 45 minutes, during which time he traversed the cable eight times. Since we know when the film begins where it will end and what it's about, the plot consists of retelling the secret logistics, dumb luck, and extraordinary skill of the team that Petit assembled. The directors incorporate archival footage, still photos, re-enactments, and lengthy interviews with the team members. As is fitting, Petit himself narrates most of his own story. Why did he do it? That, he says, is a quintessentially American question. Bravery and skill, yes, but also joy and beauty. And how did they secure the 450-pound cable 200 feet between the two towers? Watch this fascinating film, which is based on Petit's book To Reach the Clouds (2002).",1222128000,2,947,4.815950920245399
3497628,5,B001BP3Z9G,"I usually hesitate before hitting that 5 Star choice.  Not this time.  On every level Man on Wire is a superb -- partly, and understandably, recreated -- documentary.  In its stomach-churning tension of man alone in high places it reminded me of the otherwise very different Touching the Void from a few years back.  Even more than the scary -- to us normal acrophobes -- wire work, Man on Wire is memorable for its humanity, for the innocence of the whole crazy idea, for the enthusiasm and excitement that Petit conveys even thirty years after the event, for the camraderie and support that enabled the act, and perhaps most of all for the loss of that once the deed was over.  One of Petit's collaborators is overcome on camera recalling it all.  Most watchers will be as well.  Do not miss it.",1221782400,5,797,4.570422535211268
