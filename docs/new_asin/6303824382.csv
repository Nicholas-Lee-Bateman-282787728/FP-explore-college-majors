Jackson has to play Simon says with a terrorist to keep bombs from blowing up all over New York City and which is just a cover for what is really going on.  Willis and Jackson make a good team.

719781,5,6303824382,"Die Hard 3 is still an amazing action film. The best or second best in the series depending on how you look at it. It's sad the series became a joke after this, catering to the new generation with terribly soapy scripts and weak acting. This one is actually for real. McTiernan was brought back on board after the little bit over the top nature of D2 and he brings a nice subtlety here that was missing in the second go around without dousing any major flames. Great acting all around with a good to great story that plays out pretty well in the end. Some elements are a little fantastic but it all comes down well in the end. I look at this as the last Die Hard. 4 was watered down entirely and 5 was embarrassing.

The bluray transfer is pretty decent but probably could be better. It retains grain and has a pretty high bitrate, though likely comes from an older master. For the price you can't really go wrong. One of top two entries in the series and it isn't even debateable.",1437177600,4,981,4.274193548387097

719849,5,6303824382,"By the time you come to the third movie in a series, it can often become predictable.  Maybe that's one reason why I found Die Hard: With a Vengeance so refreshing.  Gone is the Christmas setting and terrorists in one isolated location.  But it's still a fun roller coaster ride.

The only character returning from the first two movies is John McClane (Bruce Willis).  He's separate from his wife (in a plot point that doesn't quite seem to make sense) and suspended from the NYPD for his alcohol abuse.

All that changes when a bomber strikes the city and asks specifically for McClane.  Calling himself Simon (Jeremy Irons), he leads McClane on a wild goose chase all around the city doing strange tasks to keep more bombs from blowing up.  Along the way, McClane gets an unlikely partner in Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), a shop keeper.  Why is Simon focused on McClane?  Will McClane be able to stop the bombs?  And what is Simon really after?

It was really nice to see McClane actually working with law enforcement this time around.  Even so, the movie still manages to keep McClane pretty much on his own.  Yes, he has Zeus, but McClane is the one driving the story forward.

As with the others, there are some decent twists to the plot.  Yes, the plot is just an excuse for the action, but it holds some surprises and is fairly logical.  The finale is a bit far fetched, but this is an action movie, so I'll give it a pass.

And the action segments are wonderful as always.  The movie literally starts with a bang and the tension doesn't stop until the end.

The acting is uniformly great.  Bruce Willis certainly has his character down, and it shows.  Samuel L. Jackson brings a humanness to his character and the movie that it would have been missing otherwise.  Jeremy Irons is a wonderfully diabolical villain.  From the rest of the cast, I was most interested in Sam Phillips who plays the mute Katya since she used to be a Christian singer in the 80's.

Speaking of the 80's, this movie was made in 1995, so it's not quite as dated as the first two in the series.  Yes, it still shows that it is almost 30 years old, mostly in the special effects and technology shown on screen.  Still, these are minor issues in the film.

I watched this one from TV, and it cut out the swearing.  Frankly, I didn't miss it, although there was enough silence to know there was plenty of it.  I'm sure some violence was cut out as well, although what was left was still pretty violent.

There are enough differences to make this movie exciting, but at the core, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is still a Die Hard movie.  And if you like action, that's a good thing.",1429488000,,2660,4.443064182194617

719933,4,6303824382,"We finally move to New York and out of the Yule season. It is still dealing with the Germans we have been dealing with before, that kind of German army trying to conquer the world, or at least some kind of back base for their criminal activities.

It starts like a game and then becomes very bitter and it becomes a real war time operation targeting Fort Knox and their reserves of gold, hundreds of billions of dollars in gold bullions. To get down there without attracting too much attention is a little bit difficult so you have to have one massive explosion that opens the street down to the underground vault.

The rest after that is nothing. John McLane gets some black innocent and neutral partner at the beginning of the game and they will become a good pair of gamesters in full addiction till the real end and finish of the hunt, chase and tracking search. It sure is more suspenseful than the Football Super Bowl. It is also quite spectacular about the damage caused to the urban environment. Crossing Central Park with a car in something like ten minutes at a peak hour late in the morning is quite spectacular.

Of course we know the gangsters will be defeated, the main leader who is the brother of a previous gang leader who was defeated and killed by John McLane, will die defeated and beaten into pureed smithereens. The whole interest of this film is to see how and here there is some inventiveness more than creativity on the side of the plot-writers and scenario-writers.

In this film some digital visual effects (hello Buena Vista) are used and that make the film slightly less rough because digital special effects are smoother, more easy-going, more fluid than standard old fashioned analog special effects. But we are used to that nowadays though it makes the film less impressive.

Just for entertainment of course. This film will not give you some intellectual overload, though with too many of these you might get into some apnea, the suspension of your breathing that could be lethal, due to the lack of cerebral activity.

Enjoy the spiritual and mental relaxation.

It is indeed violent but not graphic or gross as many films can be in the action genre.

It is improbable if not downright impossible, nothing is believable, and it is absurd to imagine that two ragamuffin individuals are going to succeed in bringing bad guys to justice while the entire police force of NYC plus the FBI and CIA only fail.

Then the debate for best Die Hard comes down to this movie and the original. Die Hard 3 might win based on the insane scale alone. School bombings, gold depositories, exploding boats, this movie has it all. Not to mention Sam Jackson giving a pretty entertaining performance. I've seen the first one probably 20-30 times and for some reason I just got around to this one recently but now I'm going to have to sit down and watch this one again because it is some high quality action.",1391558400,,729,4.367647058823529
720172,5,6303824382,"I'm a huge fan of Bruce Willis action movies. They're always great fun and Die Hard: With a Vengeance is no exception. It continues the theme of the first Die Hard movie with the original villains brother coming after McClane for revenge (and the world's money reserves in the form of thousands of gold bricks). Although unlike the previous two because in this one McClane has to race all over the city to defeat the enemy, he ends his day long adventures as always. Yippie-kie-yay, m*th*rf*ck*r!",1391472000,,496,4.77906976744186
720173,5,6303824382,"Dont believe me? Then i guess we didn't watch the same movie. I cant argue with those who say it wasn't good,or that it suffered for breaking the formula a little-simply because its like arguing with someone who says that the Earth is flat.
So in the third installment,John McClane is no longer the cocky-sure of himself Nakatomi hero. He's settled back into being just an NYPD cop. And apparently,enjoying some time off due to a disciplinary action. he looks like hell.
Thats when a mad bomber named 'Simon' calls up,and has a game to keep McClane busy,racing around the city...

Why its so good?
*Its smart,and for an action movie to be considered a 'film', thats essential.
*You get to know the characters and guess what,even the villains are likable. Of course Samuel L Jackson holds his own as the civilian partner,and Jeromy Irons is a captivating leader of the terrorists. The supporting cast of Johns department are also notable. its not an ensemble piece,but you're invested in everyone
*From a car chase to boat escape, an elevator scuffle and a game of cat and mouse-with 2 choppers-the action doesn't disappoint.
*The screenwriter. Hensleigh crafted a great story,so good in fact that the FBI wanted to talk to him.
*NYC--im sorry but i love the city,and  you can feel the atmosphere in the picture. McClane's persona becomes clearer when in his natural habitat
*The soundtrack. From the ghetto beat to a fitting use of a Loving Spoonful track and the wonderful landscape of Michael Kamens score,as well as the 9th Symphony thats become synonymous with the DIE HARD franchise,and that March-i dare you not to have it in your head the rest of the day.

Can i find anything worth picking on?
*Not really. The jump from afternoon in NYC to midnight for the climax is a bit out of sorrs. You spend 2 hours in one setting then move to another for the last 15 minutes. its okay though,

Honestly,DIE HARD 2 was good fun but,it was almost deja vu. We go from being in a building trapped by terrorists to a whole city in peril. It really is the best of the sequels.",1391299200,,2069,4.644808743169399

720466,5,6303824382,"I am a huge fan of the Die Hard series (not so much the second, but even it merits a look).  It's safe to say that if you see John McClane in a building, airplane, or telephone booth (maybe even a doughnut shop) you better run like heck because said structure will be blown up (or at the least riddled with bullets) within seconds.  Bruce Willis is the ultimate every-day hero with flaws and a biting sense of humor, as he is raised from the bottom of the bottle he has drowned himself in to battle again with an uber-terrorist bent on worldly domination (played deliciously by the always entertaining Jeremy Irons who I feel plays some of the best bad guys in the business).  Sounds too much like the first?  Heck no, because there is a high-octane, adrenaline-packed side kick in the form Samuel L. Jackson (that's Zeus, not Jesus) who provides amusement in the form of his one-line zingers, yet still able to open up a can of self-righteous whoop on the enemy.  It's a virtual feast for the senses with dazzling special effects, a great soundtrack and fast-paced dialogue (what else would you expect from razor-witted Bruce).  The characters are rich, multi-dimensional beings whom you can empathize with, or wonder how depraved they truly can be.  It's definitely a film that you can watch over and over, seeing something new each time you do so.",1349136000,,1350,4.647058823529412

A terrorist bomber who calls himself Simon is back in the business of chaos as a bomb blows up in a department store.  Simple Simon demands to the police that Lieutenant John Mc Clane be called back into the case and Simon wants to play a game called Simon Says with John Mc Clane.  If Mc Clane doesn't do what he is told then more bombs blow up.

John is told to go to Harlem and wear a derogatory sign that is sure to get him killed.  That is just the start of John's problems.  Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) helps save John's life and as a result he becomes the unwilling partner in the adventure planned by Simon.  John and Zeus are under constant time and mental pressure from Simon.  On top of that, the FBI tells him the ID of Simon who is the brother of Hans Gruber, the man John threw off of the skyscraper in the first Die Hard.

This is a fast action film with John and Zeus being given impossible tasks that they have to complete to save lives.  John figures out Simon's plans but how to stop him is another problem.

I love this Die Hard series of movies and I feel that Bruce Willis is the perfect actor for this character.  He has the right charisma and attitude to pull this character off and keep you cheering for him to survive.  You will feel sorry for John in this movie as he is abused by Simon and cheer for him in the end.  This is a good movie and I really enjoyed it.  I recommend it to you.",1345766400,,1653,4.068111455108359

720470,4,6303824382,"DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE
1995 / 131 min. / Rated R

The summer of 1995 was certainly an interesting one. It was a summer that truly offered everything from original films to sequels to every genre and subgenre. There were all forms of adaptations from novels to comic books to even video games. It was a summer movie season that had something from everybody. It had action, comedy, drama, and it even ranked high with indie titles like the terrific `Usual Suspects,' ""Smoke"" and the controversial film ""Kids"". It was a summer that would ultimately see the biggest shocker; 4 of the 5 Best Picture nominees were released during those summer months (""Braveheart,"" ""Apollo 13,"" ""Babe,"" and ""Il Postino""). Amongst it all, however, the biggest worldwide film of that year was the third outing of the ""Die Hard"" franchise. Yippie-ki-yay indeed.

I make no bones about it; Die Hard with a Vengeance is my favorite Die Hard sequel. It's that good. The plot of this one centers on a man calling himself ""Simon"" (Jeremy Irons) who begins a reign of terror in the streets of New York City by blowing up a Department store. He then threatens to detonate bombs across the city unless Detective John McClane cooperates in a wicked game of ""Simon Says"". McClane, this time around, is a broken man. His marriage is on the rocks, he's been suspended from the force and he has one very bad hangover. With the reluctant assistance of a Harlem electrician, Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), the two try to race against the clock and catch their man.

There is so much to love about this one. You have the return of director John McTiernan, you got a sharp script from Jonathan Hensleigh, and great chemistry between Willis and Jackson. Not to mention, you also have a great villain (portrayed effectively by Jeremy Irons), you get plenty of laughs, surprises and of course, no Die Hard film is complete without some terrific action set pieces along the way. In the wake of Die Hard 2 and the many films that emulated the Die Hard formula - sometimes effectively well - it's a true accomplishment that this turned out as good as it did. McTiernan - as he did with the original film - keeps an impeccable pacing that balances everything from exposition to car chases to everything in between. The one complaint that you could toss its way perhaps is that the film's ending may be a bit anti-climactic but really, who cares? It's one of a hell ride.",1318377600,,2419,4.647196261682243
720471,3,6303824382,"This movie is okay, its not as cool or action packed like the other ""Die Hard"" films are.

720472,5,6303824382,"I remember the last time I saw this flick before now-September 10,2001.  Too much of life imitating art there.  Regardless this is my favorite entry in the series and the reasons are manifold.  Firstly, John McTiernan returns to helm the action and return it to the blue collar roots of the first film.  Secondly, Jeremy Iron's tongue-in-cheek villainy if not the equal of Alan Rickman's in the first is at least comparable.  Primarily the film's real selling point is the rapport between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.  These guys riff of each other like they've been doing it for years.  No offence to Reginald VelJohnson but he's more at home with Steve Urkel then being in these two fisted affairs.  I don't think there has been a misfire in the whole series but for my money I'll take this one followed by the original.",1290384000,,829,4.6689655172413795
720473,3,6303824382,"As i said in the headline, i think this is worst of the first 3 films. Seems like with each sequel, they made less action scenes. I think the first film had enough action, then the second film had a less action, and the third film have much less action scenes.

I did not like this development after each film. This film had probably just 10 minutes of action scenes. That is disappointing. I also think they shouldn`t have made Samuel L. Jackson`s character a hostile racist. He evens teach his kids to be racists. I think he has a funny scene on the boat with a gun.

Picture Quality: 4.5/5

I think it looks more shaper and detailed compared to the previous film. That is good. I think it has enough improvement to warrant a slightly higher rating from 4.0 that i gave the 2 previous films to 4.5.

Audio Quality: 4/5

Since this film has little and short action scenes, the rears are mostly used when they run in the streets or such. I think the bass sounds good coming from the subwoofer, when we hear explosions and those big trucks. The dialog sounds a times a bit low. I don`t think this is the best film, if you want to show of your 5.1 system.

720530,4,6303824382,"The first one was spectacular, the second one was a bit more flawed but still entertaining, and the third is just the same as the second but probably a little better. Now, we all know that the first Die Hard can't be outmatched by its sequels. But hey, the sequels are still entertaining (except maybe the last one). Die Hard with a Vengeance, being the third in the series, is a bit better than the last one, and still has plenty of action, adventure, humor, and drama. Not only does it star Bruce Willis as McClane, but Samuel L. Jackson & Jeremy Irons (as the main villain) also appear, so you KNOW it's going to be good. I won't spoil anything in the story (which isn't really original, but who cares?), but I will say that there are plenty of twists. The action isn't first-rate, but it still delivers: it has as much explosions as in the first two).

Again, Die Hard with a Vengeance isn't as great as the original, but it's still pretty exciting and spectacular. It's a must-see for all Die Hard fans.

720571,5,6303824382,"Man, I was watching this movie the other day and I can't believe how good this movie is. Even though I liked Die Harder, it lacked the brains of its predecessor. John McTiernan returned to give us an action flick that not only delivers as an action flick but is also quite effective as a thriller.

Simon Peter Gruber(Jeremy Irons) is the brother of Hans Gruber who was killed by McClane in the Nakatomi Plaza. He detonates a few bombs in New York City and sends McClane on ""Fools Errands"" while covering up his real scheme: to steal gold reserves. McClane is saved from an a**kicking by angry mob by Zeus Carver(Samuel L Jackson), a shop owner. They reluctantly team up to play along with Simon's games. They later find out his big scheme all along.

Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis have excellent chemistry together. Plus you have to admire the match up. Zeus Carver has a nationalistic mentality and John McClane is your not-so-average white-bread cop. Despite their differences they still get together to handle the same goal.

Jeremy Irons is magnificent as Simon Peter Gruber. He's definitely one of the best movie villains in history. His plan showed a clever genius absent from movie villains nowadays. Quite possibly the last serious role that Jeremy Irons had. Tell the truth, can you look at him with a straight face after he starred in Dungeons and Dragons? I think not.

I like the pacing of this movie too. It keeps you glued to the screen and provides a thrill ride from start to finish. Im kind of surprised that this movie didn't do so well at the box office when everybody knows that its better than Die Hard 2. Plus this movie has lowest score of all Die Hard movies on Rottentomatoes. Shows you just how much these snooty consensus followers really know.

If you're looking for an action/thriller that doesnt disappoint you cant go wrong with Die Hard With A Vengeance. It has great acting, a superb villain, a good plot and some engaging action sequences.

Cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back in New York, but he's suspended from the NYPD and going downhill along with his marriage, when he's called back because some crazy bomber calling himself Simon (Jeremy Irons) has set bombs all over the city and is threatening to blow them all up unless McClane does exactly what Simon Says.

The first thing he's required to do is wear a racist signboard in downtown Harlem. A store owner named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) comes to his aid and ends up getting roped into the game as well.

The games were... mostly... fun, but I had a little trouble believing them--it was an awful lot of effort for the small reward of making McClane run all over the city and keeping the cops focused elsewhere. Seems like the same result could have been achieved by just the bomb in the school.

And speaking of school... I was a little insulted that both McClane and Zeus had trouble with the ""St. Ives"" riddle--didn't everyone learn that when they were schoolkids? One of them at least should have recognized it.

And of course, there was the requisite CB (aka ""crazy bitch""), who's pretty much just there for shock value, but since the CB is so awfully common (well, this was 12 years ago, so maybe it wasn't so common then?), the shock value's pretty diminished.

720633,4,6303824382,"This second sequel in the Die Hard series brings back Det. John Mclane, this time teamed up with Samuel L. Jackson. The sequel accomplishes to become an independent sequel to the previous entry. the previous entry (Die Harder) tended to make to many references to the first die hard movie. Instead this sequel manages to move on from that.

 Unlike the previous installments which take place in Christmas Eve, in this one its unclear on what day it takes place. I for one thought that was a good move from the director. as a matter of fact what makes the sequel work is the return of the first Die Hard (John McTiernan) he knows the character and the setting of these movies; so that's good.

The antagonist in this one is Simon Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber. Hans Gruber was the antagonist of the first Die Hard. It first appears as though Simon is out to avenge his brother's death, but it is later revealed that other motives are at work. All of this works in the movie....so why call the movie the ""weakest"" in the franchise? Well simple, the movie tries so hard to live up to part one by being independent from part one...""But wait you said that being independent from one was a good thing"" yes I did say that, but there is a difference from being independent and becoming independent. EX: In being independent you are making little or no mentioning of the previous film, the movie is a sequel but goes on its own path, much like a 007 movie or a Romero Zombie movie. That's how I felt Die Hard needed to be. and becoming independent is what this movie tries. for the first hour we have a movie that manages to bring up some points from the first and move on, and the last hour we have an over the top sequel that is so desperately trying to be bigger and better because its Die Hard; oh and did I mention that its with a Vengeance? lol.

Anyhow the movie is not bad; in fact it's quite entertaining and has a lot of surprises. It's just that it becomes implausible when it goes overboard. Also anther bothering thing was the editing; it was weak, specifically in the end. I later checked on the special features and it mentions that there was an alternate ending that had to be removed.

720682,5,6303824382,"I really enjoy action films, and normally I let myself just enjoy the ride without worrying too much about the acting quality going on. With Die Hard with a Vengeance, you actually get the rare combination of fun action along with some great acting as well. The combination of Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson is bordering on classic. You get far more nuance with those two characters than you see in most action movies.

And then, for the villain, I just love Jeremy Irons. He's a great actor in general, and he's perfect here! It's amusing that he plays the brother of Alan Rickman. Rickman of course plays Snape in the Harry Potter series, and Irons does a brilliant send-up of him in a comedy spoof of Harry Potter, named ""Harry Potter and the Chamberpot of Azerbaijan"".

The plot? Well, plots in most action movies tend to be pretty iffy, and this is no exception. The heroes are sent here, there and everywhere by Irons to keep them distracted from his main goal of stealing gold. There are various plot holes, but you sort of let those sorts of issues slide by when you're enjoying a fun movie. These aren't realistic movies - just how often can there be huge city-wide threats to New York City?

The movie has a fine eye for detail. There are many items that you might miss on the first time through, but which make much more sense and stand out on repeated viewings. For New Yorkers, there are numerous little fun items snuck in here and there that are amusing.

I like how even many of the minor characters have lively, memorable personalities. It reminded me of the first Beverly Hills Cop where a wide variety of characters stood out - both the major ones and the minor ones - and the whole combination created a fun movie to watch and re-watch. The same is definitely true here. Did the plot in BHC make perfect sense? Probaby not. But it's the characters and the acting - along with the action sequences - that bring you along.

I do have to say that they went a bit over the top with the swearing here. There are several video clips on the web which are just the swears running along one after the other. You can literally see the entire movie start to finish with just swears, without missing a scene, because there are so many. In some sequences it's almost minute by minute :) So that's rather excessive.

But still, a minor complaint in a movie which has a lot of plusses.

Definitely a movie for watching more than once!",1200096000,3,2441,4.459641255605381

Firstly, so people who haven't seen Die Hard can read your description and get the correct information about the characters they're going to see, and secondly, because Alan Rickman is my favorite actor and I think he deserves credit where credit is due.

It starts off OK, but then it horribly falls apart with a completely unbelievable plot. Sure, the first two movies had unbelievable plot points, but they were just that plot points and easy to forgive because the overall premise of the films were not destroyed. That does not happen here. Just when you think you can start believing in the film again, it throws a ludicrous, unbelievable plot twist in. After a while, I lost my interest in the entire film. Jeromy Irons couldn't even save the film because he is matched with a twit of a partner in crime whose acting is so over the top it is beyond laughable and border on frustrating because the filmmakers are now just insulting the viewers. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson is electric, and that was the only reason I didn't hurl the DVD out the window and watched this pathetic movie until the end.",1187136000,,1022,4.38421052631579

I know some people consider it inferior to the earlier Die Hard flicks, but in my opinion it's at least better than the second one, which is a complete carbon copy of the first--except it's set in a DC airport instead of an LA high rise.

The plot of this movie is no where near believable.  It's over the top in about every way possible.  A European madman wages war on New York City and Bruce Willis while at the same time trying to pull off the biggest heist of all time.  And just for fun he targets Samuel L. Jackson, too, an innocent shopkeeper from Harlem.  There are tons of racial stereotypes and plenty of the normal action film/buddy cop stuff going on, but the movie gets points for one thing--it's never cheesy and there aren't any large, gaping holes in the plot.  There may be scenes where you say ""that could never happen,"" and Bruce Willis is apparently more resilient than Super Man, but at least the movie never bogs down with a forced love story or artsy camera angles.

This movie is complete, mindless entertainment, but if you know and accept that going in to it, then you'll have to admit that it's at the top of it's genre--even if that genre isn't going to be winning any Academy Awards.",1183766400,5,1303,4.347107438016529

A gelid and smart terrorist (the extraordinary actor Jeremy Irons) will display a sinister plan with a double intention, to redeem the death of his brother, and on the other hand to make of New York city a city under the waters.

The dynamic stages, delirious action of this saga really involves even the most exigent spectator. There's a lot of action, and in this opportunity, Samuel Jackson was the perfect counterbalance working out as support officer of Bruce.

The ceaseless action sequences, the intriguing atmosphere and the sinister presence of Irons adds a special factor for this superb script, hovered by a tense cloud of uncertaineness from start to finish.

A solid script, a superb cast and a delirious camerawork join forces to bring us one of themost vibrant and absorbing thrillers of the Nineties.

720743,4,6303824382,"After the huge and growing success of the first two ""Die Hard"" movies, the world clamored for a third.  But how do you keep it fresh?  This story is not on Christmas, moves us to McClane's home turf in New York, splits him off from Holly (she is still in California and they haven't spoken for a year), and instead of the pleasant African-American cop Sgt Powell, we get Samuel L. Jackson as a proud and a tad angry African-American named Zeus Carver (which leads to an early misunderstanding, ""Hey, Zeus"" sounding like the Spanish pronunciation of Jesus, right?).

During the opening shot establishing that we are in New York, the title sequence ends in a rather stunning way and we are off to the races.  However, in this movie McClane doesn't impose himself into the situation, he is dragged in by the villain, who calls himself Simon and who seems to have a some kind of personal grudge against him.

The way Zeus is pulled into this mess is also quite interesting and I have to say that Samuel L. Jackson adds as much to the movie and keeping it fresh as I am sure the writers and the producers hoped.  He is terrific and makes a great foil and partner for Willis' McClane.

We expect explosions and impossible stunts in the ""Die Hard"" movies and get them aplenty here.  They found ways to stick them in (and don't) where we don't often expect them.  Jeremy Irons is fine as Simon.  His army seems to be composed of people who believe in the story he tells about why he is doing this, but some seem to be there as mercenaries without any belief.  It is quite a fascinating weave of textures in character.

Pay attention to even the little details in the beginning because they come back.  Nothing is in there for idle chat even if it seems like idle chat.

The production budge of this movie was even bigger than the first two, but the U.S. gross was down a bit from Die Hard 2, however, the gross overseas was about has big as the total gross fro the second film.  It was huge.

I will say that there is an awful lot of swearing and f-words in this movie that I found grinding after awhile.  Really, writers, you can use other words.  We do not need a curse every other word to know that these guys are under stress.  Graham Greene's does a great job and his character is under just as much stress and you found a way that he didn't swear (I don't believe).  Thanks for that at least.

There are some extras on the making of the film, the director's voice over commentary if you like watching the film that way, and stuff on how the special effects were done.

If you like this kind of thing, it is pretty good and part of a now classic series.",1172966400,,2650,4.321862348178137

720745,4,6303824382,"Most fans don't seem to like this one and although I don't think it's as good as the first 2, I think it's still a fun film. A man named Simon (well played by Jeromy Irons) says he wants to play a game with John Mclaine or he'll continue to cause mayhem in the city. So the police have choice but to call a hungover John Mclaine to do whatever Simon says. Samual L. Jackson plays a shopkeeper who Simon makes team up with Willis after he prevents Willis from getting killed. Well since Simon makes him wear a sign in the middle of the city that says I hate black people, well not in those words but worse actually. They than have to solve Simon's riddles and get hints to where he planted bombs all over the city. The film has an inventive plot that at least is different than the first 2.  It also sounds a lot better than the upcoming plot of part 4. I mean in that one John Mclaine is to team up with a hacker (Justin Long) against....internet terrorists. I'm not kidding, that is the plot lol.

  Part 1 and 2 have more heart and emotion than this one and his wife Holly is nowhere to be seen.  But still it's  a good pop corn flick and I can't really say that it's not a smart film. Samual L. Jackson makes a good partner for Willis too even if the script has either complain or argue with Willis too much. I mean there's one scene where they are trying to find a bomb while Jackson accuses Willis of wanting to call him a prejudice name.  Probably the best thing about the movie is that it links it with part 3.

""I want to play a game.  'Simon Says.'  Simon is going to tell Lieutenant McClane what to do and Lieutenant McClane is going to do it.  Noncompliance will result in a penalty.""  (The penalty is a bomb detonated in a public place in New York city.)

The above, said by ""terrorist"" Simon (Jeremy Irons), is what most of this movie is about.  New York city cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) has to go from one end of the city to the other as he struggles to keep up with Simon's deadly game.  As the game proceeds, McClane picks up an unwilling civilian partner named Zeus (Sam L. Jackson) with a chip on his shoulder.

Why is Simon doing this?  It turns out that he is the brother of Hans Gruber, the head ""terrorist"" who was killed by McClane in the first ""Die Hard"" movie (1988).  Simon is doing this to get vengeance on McClane (or so it seems).

Those who like lots of explosions, car chases, gunfire, blood, and other special effects should enjoy this movie.

However, those who want more in what they view may be disappointed.  Even though there is humor in spots, the first half of the movie has McClane with Zeus just doing want Simon says to do and the second half is McClane chasing Simon.  That's it!!  What makes this second sequel slightly more interesting that the first one (entitled ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" 1990) is the inclusion of Jackson as Zeus and the antics that occur between McClane and Zeus.  Irons also turns in a fine performance as the villain Simon (though not anywhere near as interesting as the villain Hans Gruber in the original Die Hard movie).

Willis again turns in a fine performance.  Unfortunately, they have him now separated from his wife.  His wife under the threat of being killed was a key element of the Die Hard movies.  With this essential element removed, this movie, as a result, just turns into your standard cop chasing a bad guy movie.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2005) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are a few extras of which I found the alternate ending the most interesting.

In conclusion, those who like action and special effects will probably enjoy this movie.  Others, however, will probably be disappointed!!!

SO FAR, DIE HARD IS THE ONLY SERIES WITH EVERYTHING BEING 5 F**KING STARS! Ok, I really need to breathe (woooooooooo-hhhoooooooo)Much better. Okay, on to what this movie is about. John McClane is being stalked by someone who has blown up part of a city block. At first, all we know is that this someone has an axe to grind with him, and that unless John does exactly as he says, he will destroy more property and kill more people without any hesitation or mercy. First, he tells John to stand in the road with a sign that says: ""I HATE N***ERS"" WHAT A VILLAIN! HE'S MAKING JOHN BE RACIST AND IF JOHN DOESN'T DO IT, HE'LL KILL MORE INNOCENTS! THAT'S EVIL PERFECTION LADIES & GENTS!  Soon, John gets the attention of a store runner, who seems not to be too pleased with white people, or at least the majority of them. John is attacked by black teens who have no clue that he's doing this for lives, but the store runner, an African American by the name of Zeus(yeah, like the Greek God, as he said ""You climb up on my Olympus, I shove a lightning bolt up yo ass Zeus! You got a problem with that?!?)saves his life because John has explained what is going on. Soon, the two team up, with John's  police friends trying to find out who the hell this maniac is &  why he's so focused on getting to John he'll do anything. John and Zeus look around for clues, calling the villain on the phone for what they need to do next if they want New York to live. Soon both of them are stealing taxis, jumping on trains, running all over the place, solving puzzles to disarm bombs, getting into arguments with each other, and facing all sorts of deception and treachery. Finally they find out that the man who is behind all this is none other than Simon Gruber, the older brother of Hans Gruber, who John killed in the first Die Hard movie. Seems he found out what John did, and he's looking for more than a simple apology. John and Zeus soon get into all sorts of vehicles, and  are in fights on foot, in bulldozers, in the pouring rain and/or flooding pipe water and of course on Simon Gruber's boat. In all of this, they gun down a lot of Simon's terrorists, and the rest they kill by turning the car over, beating them with anything around that could be used as a weapon, including their fists, or

ripping them in half with ropes. Soon enough, Simon has done his share of damage, and the two heroes are tied to a pole in a room where a bomb is about to explode and blow them to kingdom come. But they find a way out, and they manage to get off the boat, find that Simon still has more men, off those men with firearms & explosives,& then John finally manages to destroy Simon himself.  Simon tries, along with the last man he has, to get away in a helicopter. But even after all his tricks, all his assaults on schools and the people of New York and all the gold & other sort of money he stole, that is not enough to save him or the man he's with from a large explosive fired upon the helicopter by John. The copter explodes, goes down in fire, and takes Simon and his buddy with it. If the explosion didn't kill them(which it most likely did anyway)the fire surely will. John then remembers the argument he had with his wife. Zeus sees a phone, and suggests he use that to talk to her. John says: ""You know my wife. She's a stubborn woman!"" But he laughs & calls her anyway. End of series.

Now for the good things and bad things in this perfect conclusion

The Good Things

There's much more action & lots more blood/gore than the first 2

There's lots of funny/cool/interesting quotes, many with cursing

John is much cooler than he was in the first two in this one

Zeus is a unique hero. He pretends not to care but really does

Simon was a terrific villain. As a matter of fact, he is my 2nd favorite Die Hard villain next to Stuart. Hans is 3rd, of course

There was even this one scene where the nastiest & coolest b*tch you'll ever have the misfortune to meet slashed a guy to death with a knife and kept slashing after that until Simon stopped her

Not only were the fight scenes well organized and guns along with knives were used, but the director even went so far as to use all the explosives he could recall off the top of his head. Chilling

The famous movie ending line ""Yippie Kay Yay, motherf**ker!"" is used by John McClane to wrap up the finale of the series. I loved it when he used that line in the first 2, I love it now. Period.

We get to see a flashback of Hans Gruber's death in the 1st movie

Some people have commented on the fact that Brucie baby is getting on a bit now, but he still looks fine in this movie - they'd be testing our patience if they did a fourth Die Hard.

I've seen the first one (and reviewed it), but haven't seen the second one, due to the fact the first two were based on a very hectic Christmas Eve. And we're in the middle of summer, so instead, the second has been pencilled in for just before this Christmas please :) (Along with Reindeer Games) So I felt a bit out of sorts watching it without even seeing the second one. Although, the first sequel is normally quite bad (Scream 2, Terminator 2, etc). I was wondering what happened to Bonnie Bedelia, who wasn't in this, more's the pity, and the fact that this wasn't based on Christmas Eve was a shame. Although his wife gets mentioned a plenty, there's not much of a valid reason given as to why she features strongly in the first one, but why she's suddenly cast aside for the third. It does lead to many jokes about why can't Bruce can't keep his hands on a woman.

Samuel L Jackson is once again credited as the bit part, the second in command to the terrific Bruce. He never seems to get much of the lead roles, and instead is second to someone much greater. But in this, they seem to befriend each other, even though they hated each other to begin with - such a cliche.

This film involves a character's brother from a previous film, not to give the game away, but it's quite fun. They have to solve riddles, which would have been fun for some people, but most of them, especially the elephant & 4 gallons of water riddles went straight over my head! While everyone's running around, fearing bombs going off any second, it's obvious to the viewer that it's all a trick, and the bomb could go off in a completely different place.

There's some spectacular action scenes, the most memorable one is the train sequence, which thoroughly beats Speed hands down. I think my jaw dropped during most of it.

There are no memorable lines from this - the first Die Hard seemed so quotable, unless you have a brain similar to a sieve like moi, but there's not much memorable about this movie. Unless you like Bruce Willis. Then there's loads memorable! His white vest has become a bit of a trademark.

Overall, it's a good movie, but I sometimes find there's a lot of action, and not much else inbetween. I think it's highly unlikely that there's going to be a fourth, if there is, I'll be highly disappointed. He should just grow old gracefully.",1093910400,2,2639,4.408624229979466
720792,3,6303824382,"John McTiernan returned to direct this second follow-up to McTiernan's original DIE HARD from 1988, but unfortunately all his considerable skill and energy can't rise above screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh's generic script. DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE could easily have been LETHAL WEAPON 4 (maybe it almost was), and the script does little to make it stand out from other buddy action-movies (although Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson undoubtedly do work well together). As for the action scenes, they're certainly well-executed, but there's just no real momentum connecting the action scenes the way there was in the second half of DIE HARD 2. In VENGEANCE, there's just one action scene piled upon another, and the whole thing simply feels like an incoherent mess, which certainly was not the case in the first two films of the series.
DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE will certainly entertain action fans, since the action scenes are undeniably creative and well-mounted. Compare VENGEANCE to the first two DIE HARDs, though, and there's no contest. DIE HARD will forever be an action classic, and DIE HARD 2 was a generally worthy sequel. In that company, DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE is merely average.",1085961600,2,1197,5.081218274111675
720853,2,6303824382,"The most flattering appraisal one could give of ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" is ""moronic"".  What else is one to remark of a movie in which people are manifestly killed for the pleasure of the audience watching it?  It is a sign of our profoundly debased and witless times that the same rating of 3.5 stars should have been given by a pundit to this brutal, vainglorious, and puerile film as he had elsewhere deigned to give to a very different film, ""Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet"" (1940; director William Dieterle; starring Edward G. Robinson, in a magnificent performance), which concerns the historical career of a famous medical scientist and his brilliant and heroic accomplishments, which quite literally saved countless millions of human lives.",1078099200,,747,5.065040650406504
720854,5,6303824382,"There are plans for ""Die Hard 4: Die Hardest"" for 2005, with Bruce Willis back for a fourth time and director John McTiernan back for a third as John McClane and his daughter become involved in yet another terrorist plot.  I have high hopes for such a film because the ""Die Hard"" series has been one of the strongest in the action genre.  Granted, the best of the bunch remains the original 1988 film, which is the standard by which all subsequent films in the genre have been judged: ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" was ""Die Hard"" in an airport and ""Speed"" was ""Die Hard on a Bus,"" not to be confused with ""Speed II"" which was ""Die Hard"" and ""Speed"" on a boat.  Apparently Willis only does these movies when he has one that thinks it will work, which would explain why ""Die Hard with a Vengeance,"" the third film in the series, came out in 1995, five years after the sequel.
The best thing that can be said about this movie is that it would have worked even if it was not a ""Die Hard"" movie.  The idea that John McClane is once again on the outs with his wife (who never appears in the film) is getting stale and the idea that he is being targeted by this film's mysterious villain simply named Simon (Jeremy Irons) could just as easily have a different explanation than one that ties this film back to the original.  In fact, what makes this third one a solid action film is that it does indeed go back to the original for two of its strongest elements.  The first is the idea that the crime is a fairly complex robbery dressed up with a lot of distractions.  The second is that McClane's character had a tenuous anchor with another person; in the original it was Reginald VelJohnson's Al Powell, although for most of the film it was merely by radio.  That fault is rectified in this film with Willis given a strong co-star in Samuel L. Jackson's Zeus Carver.  This time it is Jackson's character who suddenly finds himself in extraordinary circumstances, forced by some nut with a whole lot of bombs at his disposal to jump through a bizarre series of hoops.
One of the key elements in the success of the ""Die Hard"" movies was that McClane managed to use his brains at opportune moments.  That issue is forced to the extreme in this one as the voice at the other end of a long series of phone calls provides one deadly brainteaser after another.  This allows the logic of the movie produce a series of stunts and action sequences as the two mismatched heroes race around New York City trying to avoiding anybody getting killed (including themselves).  Willis and Jackson work well off of each other, helped by the fact there characters are not stupid, and that despite the yelling and screaming solving problems is the highest priority.  We have seen all of these elements before from all the action/buddy movies that Hollywood has produced, and their success remains contingent on how much we like watching the two buddies do what they gotta do.  The whole idea of these things is to provide a compelling thrill ride, and by that standard ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" delivers.",1072828800,12,3073,4.493716337522442
720855,5,6303824382,"The third and last entry in the explosively awesome Die Hard Trilogy brings the series full circle in many ways, yet also into new territory and ended the series on a great note.
The movie finds our beloved and now highly unstable John McClane back in his home city of New York City as an NYPD officer after he couldn't adjust to life in Los Angeles and is now once again estranged from his wife Holly. Even worse is that McClane himself has become very unstable and is struggling with severe depression and drinking problems stemming from the extreme stress of what he had to go through saving the Nakatomi Plaza hostages as well as an entire fleet of jetliners at the Dulles Airport from vicious radical rogue terrorists.
However, McClane's life of fighting vicious terrorist forces are not yet over when a bomb goes off at a store in Manhattan and a new group of mercenaries led by Simon Gruber, the brother of the late Hans Gruber who met his spectacular demise in the 1988 original, puts John McClane into a confusing and deadly labyrinth of `Simon says' games to try to get his revenge on him for the death of Hans years ago. The truth is that Simon Gruber is aiming to seize gold from the Federal Reserves and threatens to release an extremely toxic chemical if his goals are not met by a given deadline. McClane goes and tries to solve the dangerous puzzles to foil Simon's deadly schemes.
To make matters even more complicated and daunting, John McClane finds his world entangling with that of a store owner named Zeus Carver (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Carver is almost the extreme opposite of Al Powell from the previous two movies. McClane's life is saved by Mr. Carver after a during one of the odd games. Carver's attitude clashes fiercely with McClane's as he is turned off and vexed by Carver's semi-racist personality and it all makes for an unpleasant addition to McClanes problems. The two though put aside their differences as they both team up to put a stop to Simon's terrorist goals and save New York City from disaster.
This movie is a great continuation of the punch that the first two Die Hard movies had but at the same time, takes the series into some very different territory. Officer McClane had the help and friendship of the warm-hearted friend Al Powell on his two previous mission. NOT ANYMORE! On here, he and Carver start off having nothing but contempt for each other at the beginning but then cast aside their differences as they become a very unlikely allies against Simon's evil schemes. The often clashing interaction between McClane and Carver is just filled with wit and energetic punch and even some humor. It's for this reason that ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" is just about as good as it's predecessors. It sometimes is funny watching John and Zeus arguing with each other trying to solve the constant stream of riddles to foil the bad guys goals.

Unfortunately Bonnie Bedelia's character Holly McClane does not appear anywhere at all in this movie (did Holly pass away or something after the jet incident?) but is mentioned in a few parts of the movie. This one, John is fighting to save his own life instead of Holly's (She seems to be safe far away from any danger in L.A.). In some ways, I like how they changed the whole pairing idea here. Instead of a romantic pairing like it was with John and Holly, we get an `unlikely buddies' pairing with John and Zeus. In ways, this works as it attempts to break the mold that often defines countless action films, saving the woman he loves, and defeating the bad guys. Also, instead of constantly being in tight spots like the first two movies, the two race through the crowded streets of New York, through subway tunnels and even underground water tunnels.
A wonderful job they did on here!
Jeremy Iron's role as Simon Gruber results in the best action film baddie since Alan Rickman made Hans Gruber the best bad guy in action moviemaking in history and is better than Colonel Stuart in the ""Die Hard 2"" movie. Not say Stuart's character was bad at all, Sadler did a good job on that one too, just not quite as memorable as the other two.
This movie is a bit more unsettling as it comes dangerously close to being realistic and that the things that have taken place here are seemingly minor mishaps compared to the horrors of what has happened in real life. Brushing that aside, this is some good escapist entertainment.
""WAV"" is an absolutely brilliant follow-up to the previous two DH movies and in several ways, feels like a totally different movie altogether like as if it were to be a totally separate movie but instead was installed as a sequel. I total admire the filmmakers for branching out into new territory with this film and as a result, the Die Hard movie trilogy to me, is the most consistent action movie trilogy of all time. I wish I could've said the same for quite a good number of other movie trilogies. No sequel slumps at all here. Bruce Willis' shining achievements of his career are the Die Hard movie and these three movies are absolute must haves, whether to see intelligent moviemaking or just to have a large can of soda and a bag of potato chips.",1064361600,3,5173,4.598484848484849
720856,4,6303824382,"Die Hard With a Vengeance reunites actor Bruce Willis and director John McTiernan for a second sequel to their 1988 mega-thriller Die Hard.  Adapted from a non-Die Hard script titled Simon Says by screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh, this third chapter in the John McClane saga is more offbeat and just a bit darker than expected.
Although it still follows the Die Hard formula - and how could it not? - of McClane versus formidable obstacles, Die Hard 3 wisely avoids the Christmas Crises scenarios from the first two films.  Gone also (although the movie never really explains why) is Bonnie Bedelia's Holly, although she is mentioned in several scenes.  Apparently McClane never adjusted to life in Los Angeles and returned to his job in the New York Police Department.
So when a bomb goes off at a Bonwit Teller store in Manhattan, it is providential for the Big Apple that McClane is a lieutenant in New York's Finest, albeit a depressed and beer-swilling lieutenant.  Providential because we know that when arch-villain ""Simon"" (Jeremy Irons) demands that McClane participate in a potentially deadly version of the game ""Simon Says,""  our Everyman hero will rise to the occasion and thwart Simon's deadly scheme.
As in the first Die Hard film, McTiernan pairs McClane with an interesting partner.  Where in the 1988 flick Willis was helped by Reginald Veljohnson (better known as Carl from Family Matters), in Die Hard with a Vengeance his charismatic and reluctant partner is played by Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Star Wars Episodes I and II).  Their ""unlikely buddies"" routine is energetic and witty, and Jackson plays his Harlem store owner character with a mixture of biting wit, bewilderment, and even dignity.
The Special Edition 2-disc set, like the previous two in the series, contains the movie on Disc 1 with interactive menus,  anamorphic Widescreen presentation, various audio and subtitle options, and commentary by director McTiernan and screenwriter Hensleigh.  Disc 2, of course, has the usual theatrical trailer and TV spots, several TV ""making of"" specials, a special-effects breakdown, and an interview with Bruce Willis.",1058227200,19,2147,5.182080924855492

720858,4,6303824382,"""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" is a full-blooded action vehicle; it is a smart one, too, because its filmmakers realize the ol' one-man-army-trapped-in-an-area routine can't last long. So they have changed the technique to a game of revenge: cat-and-mouse. Some could call it smarter than its predecessors; and on a level as a thriller I must admit it is more intense. It is a lot better than the 1990 Renny Harlin actioner ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder."" But on terms of fun, you can't beat the original.
John McTiernan, who brought us ""Predator,"" ""The 13th Warrior"" and ""Die Hard,"" returned to end this series on a high note. Of course, like all sagas, ""Die Hard"" is far from over, with another sequel due to be released summer 2004. But until then, we can look to ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" as the end-all to the overall excellent John McClane trilogy.
The third film opens up where nothing left off; McClane (Bruce Willis) is on the streets of NYC when a man who calls himself ""Simon"" blows up a Manhattan department store, and then orders McClane to stand in Harlem with a sandwich board that says...well...something you wouldn't want to be wearing in Harlem.
After a convenience store owner named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) saves McClane, Simon orders both men to run around New York City and do Simon Says-type-games. It's all good fun, and a step away from the original film. Which can be good or bad.
Soon McClane finds out that ""Simon"" is really the brother of Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) from the first film, and that ""Simon"" is out for revenge against McClane (or is he?), and he will stop at nothing to kill McClane. But, of course, being a madman, he plays mind games with John McClane first. And the simon says mind games are tense and action-packed.
It's hard to compare something like this to the original for one major reason: It is nothing like the original. The original was about a lone man fighting off a million guys, Rambo-style. But what saved it from becoming another average action spectacular was the great dialogue, non-stop SMART action sequences, and engaging performences by all aboard the project. Fast-forward two years later and you've got a replicant copy of the first film set in Dulles airport in Washington, D.C. But in all respect, ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" is not recycled. Its technique is new, and it almost seems as if it is not a sequel to the other ""Die Hard"" films. Which is probably not too odd, seeing that the script, originally titled ""Simon Says"" (no, not the Dennis Rodman one), was actually a sequel to ""Lethal Weapon."" Of course, modifications were made after the ""Die Hard"" series bought out the script, but the character of Zeus was probably Danny Glover, and John McClane was probably Mel Gibson. Thinkabouddit.
Bruce Willis is still John McClane. This film takes his character into a bit of a darker realm. McClane now has an alcohol problem, and his wife has left him again. Man, you'd think after having your life saved TWICE by the same guy that MAYBE you should stick with him. In fact, we don't even see McClane's wife (Bonnie Bedalia) in this film at all. Although we are led to believe they will hook up again at the end.
Samuel L. Jackson adds some flair to the film, taking the movie into a more cop-buddy dimension (""Lethal Weapon""). Jackson's character is a racist, and it's a bit odd to see a black racist in a film. It's usually those nasty white fellas. :)
I liked Jackson's character, because it provides for dialogue outlet on McClane's behalf, and sets the film up for some very funny sequences. The character interaction is a lot stronger here than it was in ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder.""
""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" is hard to compare to the original because it is so very different. But the bottom line is that this sequel is much better than ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder,"" but a step down from ""Die Hard."" But seeing how different it is, you might think it is better than both the films. It really depends on your preferences.
I give this solid action film a solid rating of 4/5 stars - an all-around solid action sequel. Solid fun.

720859,5,6303824382,"Despite the fact that many believe the first Die Hard film was the best of the series, I tend to disagree and I consider Die Hard With A Vengeance to hold that title.  John McClane (Bruce Willis) finds himself back in New York when a serial bomber (Jeremy Irons) begins terrorizing the city.  Soon McClane is sent on tedious suicide errands alongside a Harlem shopkeeper (Samuel L. Jackson) as a distraction while Irons and his brigade rob the gold from the Federal Reserve.  Director John McTiernan (who helmed the original but did not on Die Hard 2, that job went to Renny Harlin) returns and keeps the film packed with pure action and suspense.  Willis is as colorful as ever in the role that made him a household name, while Jackson is great as well and the two are great and comical as two reluctant partners.  Irons is at his villianous best, and next to Alan Rickman (whose character is the brother of Irons' character) he is the best villian in the series.  My only complaint about the film is, as the Amazon review states above, that there is quite a number of plot holes towards the last quarter of the film, but they can be easily ignored while you watch the ridiculously comic action sequences in awe.  All in all, Die Hard With A Vengeance is my favorite film of the Die Hard Trilogy, and is one of my favorite action films of all time.",1046563200,4,1349,4.459349593495935
720860,4,6303824382,"DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is the third installment in the Die Hard series and finds our beloved cop hero, John McClane, at home in New York City. The brother of the lead terrorist that McClane got rid of in the first film, seems to have a personal vendetta to settle with McClane. Simon (Jeremy Irons) has McClane perform all sorts of life-endangering stunts for his amusement. One stunt involves McClane wearing a very racist sign stark naked in Harlem. He is saved there by a local store owner, Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) who because of his Good Samaritan deed, inadvertently becomes a part of the plot. Actually, Simon is just using his hatred of McClane as a cover for his real plot, to steal the Federal Reserve in NYC.

Whereas the original DIE HARD was a guy's romance (lots of action all to save the girl), DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is a buddy movie. The pairing of Willis and Jackson is genius and the camaraderie and verbal wit between the duo is pure delight.

The movie has a great deal of action but doesn't have as tight script as the original DIE HARD. It tries to make up for that with bigger explosions and action scenes. Of course sometimes bigger isn't always better. Some of the early scenes were so realistic that this movie was postponed for a few months because of the Oklahoma City bombing. After 9-11, some may find some of the scenes to be uncomforting, unsettling, and hitting too close to home. But keep in mind, this movie was made when Hollywood kept feeding us the myth--that we all wanted to believe-- that terrorism could never happen to us.

Other than the scenes that some may find unsettling and a loose script, the other drawback of the film is that McClane is separated from his beloved wife Holly, which just doesn't fit the DIE HARD formula. The first two films were guy romances which made them enduring. This picture has taken that romantic element out and attempted to replace it with the buddy angle. It works, but it isn't as enduring. Whereas in the first two movies, McClane was saving the world to save his wife, in this movie he's saving the world to save his life.",1044662400,,2114,4.528795811518324

Now, the big question is: how in the world could one man plant all of these bombs around the city without someone finally noticing them? But no matter.

720894,4,6303824382,"This second sequel to the immensely popular Die Hard is a bit different this time around.  Instead of an enclosed location, this one spans all of New York City (making it a good, and far more thrilling, alternative to tourism), as Lt. John McClane and streetwise shopowner Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) have to race around the Big Apple at the whim of a mad bomber's (Jeremy Irons) demands.
This third-go-round for NYPD cop John McClane is the best of the series (and actually seems to negate Die Hard 2 considering he was LAPD in that picture), not only because it's more clever and thrilling than its predecessors, but because of director John Mctiernan's ingeniouse use of locales to build excitement and suspense.  The film uses inventive methods of making the locations add to the flavor, and doubles the effectiveness by adding the street-smart savvy of both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, whose knowledge of the city works like a charm both in terms of the plot and the film's entertainment value.
Speaking of Willis and Jackson, DHWV is played as a buddy show, and the chemistry between the two is simply excellent, easily equalling anything Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have worked on together.  Jackson, as a new addition to the series, plays a near-racist black man who initially dislikes McClane, but eventually becomes friends with. Willis' and Jackson's verbal spars strike up some big laughs, and better yet, you actually care about their fates, not only as to whether or not they're going to live through the situation, but the fact that you hope they'll get past their differences and end up as best buddies.  Sure, it's all predictable, but it's all played out with so much fun, you don't even really care.  Also worth mentioning among the cast is a German-accented Jeremy Irons as the bomber, this being his last truly excellent villainous performance before he'd go on to embarrass himself in Dungeons and Dragons.
The action's great and non-stop, with the expected explosions, shootouts, and fist fights, as well as several superb car chases, including a drive through a park and a tidal wave of water in a tunnel that need to be seen to be believed.  Getting a breather is a little unlikely, but it's nice to see a film that manages to develop its lead characters nicely in the midst of so much action.  If the film disappoints in any aspect, it's with several leaps of logic in the plot (they're very noticeable, too) and the conclusion, which feels pretty limp in comparison to all the exciting material that came before it.

Zeus helps McClane at the beginning and from there on, they are forced to travel through New York together as they are constantly toyed with by the nemesis of the movie, this time played by Jeremy Irons.  Once again, McClane must use his wits, as well as his toughness, to get through the day.  The racial tensions that come up between McClane and Zeus are very believable and show aspects of both sides.  This movie was directed by John McTiernan, the same man who directed the first one.  His skill with direction is made obvious with his balance of action and emotion, although not so much as the first one.  The claustrophobia of the building created a greater tension in the first movie, whereas this one takes place all over New York city.  It lends to giving this movie it's own style and helping it seperate itself from the first one, but something still gets lost.  Don't fret though, this is still a great film with great action and truely clever moments.
With the extras that are included in the Special Editions and the Five Star Collectors pack, any fan of all three movies would not hesitate to buy it.  If you don't feel you should have all three, at least buy the first movie, it is definitely worth it and may get you to spring for the other two, or at least the third.

720901,4,6303824382,"Much like the `Rambo' trilogy preceding it, the `Die Hard' series seems to get even more ridiculously implausible and over-the-top with each subsequent installment! More gunfire, a heavier body count, bigger explosions, and meatier exit wounds abound in `...With a Vengeance', the final (so far) outing in the ""Die Hard' trifecta. Throw in `Pulp Fiction' buddy Samuel L. Jackson for Bruce Willis' McClane character to play off of, and you've got yet another twist on the well-worn `partners-who-don't-particularly-like-each-other-at-first-but-eventually-do-at-the-end' action flick premise. Oh yeah, let's not forget to add an Englishman (Jeremy Irons) playing a German (like Alan Rickman did in the first DH) as your basic somewhat-arrogant, cold & calculating heavy. Oh, which reminds me: I recommend you catch the first `Die Hard' before sitting down to this one, since the first flick directly relates to this one. And no, I'll not tell you what the relationship is; you'll have to find out for yourself!
Anyway, time to discuss the extra features. This being part of Fox's 5-Star Collection DVD releases, you can expect quite a few extras to be included. In fact, there's so many extras that just about all of them (save for director John McTiernan's feature-length commentary track), are on a second disc! Included on this platter are many of the things you'd expect in a special-edition digital disc release: 3 behind-the-scenes documentaries/ featurettes, theatrical trailers & TV spots, interviews, special effects breakdowns and storyboard sequences. Then there's the extra I consider the most interesting: the alternate ending. Although I don't consider it any better or worse than the ending they decided to go with, I found it to be interesting none the less. The different ending here likely would've altered the course of future `Die Hard' follow-ups, if & when they ever see production and release!

It had a different director, different group of terrorists, he even moved to the LAPD! Whats up with that!? John Mclane is the perfect New York Cop, no way he's an LA cop. And unfortunatly, when he moved to the LAPD he changed into an LA cop. He's too emotional in this movie and there's too much romance. Yeah the action is good but it doesn't feel like a Die Hard movie. When I heard that John McTiernan was directing this one I was a bit relieved and it took place in New York so that was another relief. From the first moments of this movie I knew is would bring back my reminiscences of the first Die Hard (A department store exploding is the perfect way to start a Die Hard movie). This movie follows all the routes the first Die Hard movie took. All except its in the summer not around Christmas and doesn't take place in a building.

The Die Hard people did the right thing by bringing back John McTiernan for the third installment. However, this movie never clicks like the first film did. It never becomes as heart-pounding, isn't as strong as far as plot is concerned, it just doesn't have that intangible magic. That doesn't mean it is not enjoyable. Willis is at his wisecracking best, Jackson is good, Irons is a wonderful villain (but can't hope to compare to Hans Gruber). There are some good sequences here.

Bruce Willis, who reprises his role as John McClane, has to do whatever Simon (a madman played by Jeremy Irons) says or he'll blow up a public place. Along to help McClane is Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) the third and last of the male leads. Although the plot gets a lot more complicated and is full of different twists and turns, I not going to tell you anymore because I'll be giving away the whole movie.
Although Die Hard 3 doesn't have nearly as much action as the first two, it does deliver hilarious dialouge (courtesy of Sameuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis) and some exciting scenes. For example, there is metro train explosion, a car chase, a bloody elevator shootout, a trip down the watery aqueduct tunnels, a pleasant drive through the park, a little side trip to a huge boat, and a helicopter shootout. Yep, folks. That's all in one 2 hour movie. (WOW!) Also, director John McTiernan (who directed the original Die Hard but not the second) directed Die Hard 3. This time, McTiernan decided to all out and make the film take place in a whole city instead of a building. Some people may like that and other may not.
The only bad thing I found about the movie was this: IT WAS GODD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL. If you like the first two, you should definetly give this one a chance.",996710400,,1428,4.433460076045628

His family is estranged from him, he's coming out of a hangover (with migraine to boot), has a madman (Jeremy Irons) intent on driving him nuts under the threat of destroying New York, and he also has a unwilling civilian (Samuel L. Jackson) who must be a participant in this insane game.  If things couldn't get any worse, they do.  ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" manages to be quite a change of pace from the two previous ""Die Hard"" films.  The film moves at a fast pace for it's first two-thirds, but eventually starts to sputter to the finish line.  It's a solid action movie (despite some rather implausible situations and solutions) and seems to cap off the series nicely.  The Special Edition DVD boasts a commentary with returning director John McTiernan and screenwriter John Hensleigh (who explains the true origins of ""Die Hard 3""), plus behind-the-scenes specials and documentaries, a alternate ending (rather dark, but interesting to see what could have been), trailers, and TV ads (look for the gag reel hidden in the 2nd disc's menu).

Along the way McClane picks up an unwilling partner named Zeus(Samuel L. Jackson).  Together they race back and forth across New York City trapped in Simon's deadly game.
This is one non stop action flick with quite a few laughs thrown in.  It may not be as good as the first Die Hard, but it is still a great film on its own.  This film has several great action scenes like the cab ride threw the park and a bloody shoot out in a elevator.  So there are some plot holes but the action does more then make up for it.
The DVD is loaded with three featurettes, storyboards, interviews and trailers.  Also the alternate ending was very cool and I prefered it to the one they ended up using.  For those of you like me who own the first DVD release, it is well worth replacing with this new special edition.  The picture is much better and the sound is now in DTS.  This film has a high replay value, I always find myself pulling it off the shelf.  I can't recommend it enough.",995068800,,1124,4.279620853080568

You could see fuzz in almost every scene and the sound quality wasn't that great.  Now, I have just seen this movie in the new ultimate edition box set and I loved it!  It was everything I was hoping for and more.
For those who don't know, this film is about a madman who is threatening to blow up public places in New York unless Willis and Jackson are able to perform certain tasks.  The action is outstanding, the car chases are breath taking, and the acting is awesome.  Bruce Willis is hillarious with his sarcastic and short tempered humor.
This new and improved special edition of ""Die Hard 3"" is more than I hoped for.  The picture quality is crystal clear.  In fact, there are some scenes where the picture is TOO clear!  I forgot how beaten up and bruised Bruce Willis gets in this movie!
For those who have DVD players who can play DTS will also enjoy the new sound transfer.  It was ten times louder and thrilling with the new DTS analog, which makes the movie even better.  The crashes and gun shots sound a lot more better and louder.
I was very pleased with this new remastered version of ""Die Hard 3"".  I will have to watch the other two in the box set to see if they are just as good.  I highly recommend this DVD, or box set to anyone who loves ""Die Hard"".",995068800,9,1383,4.256704980842912

Actually, expanding the area he has to go through makes the film more exciting, since there is always the chance he won't make it to the next challenge in time. You actually wonder if he can succeed at the tasks presented to him, since he doesn't succeed every time. Also, the film works more on suspense than the fistfights and gunplay of the first two.

 ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" gives us a much more enjoyable nonstop actionfest. It was fun to watch Jackson and Willis flailing around frantically, saving not only their own necks, but the city's, too. Jeremy Irons portrays the Russian criminal, out for revenge and looking to settle a score. The Russian acts by way of telephone mostly, playing games with McClane and his partner, giving them math problems and all sorts of goodies that reveal how to stop explosions. Action sequences in this are top of the line; seeing Willis race with time instead of another person is enjoyable.

It is great  fun to watch McClane and Carver (Jackson) fight while trying to accomplish  their task, and it is also fun to see McClane match wits with Gruber's  slick German accent, possibly the best villain of the series.

720989,2,6303824382,"As if John McTeirnan has shown a terminal illness from Medicine Man on, Die Hard 3 is laborious, lifeless, logicless, and just a bore.  At least you can say hats off to McTeirnan by trying to take the fun out of a  character who antics and energy launched a thousand stupid knockoffs.  But  instead of succeeding in making Willis' McClane a darker, almost anti-hero,  perhaps he should have given him some anti-depressants.  The plot just  doesn't know what to do with Willis' character.  It makes him darker and  bitter...and then he gets chased by a madmen. End of character conflict,  unless you count his overwhelming angst and grief in trying to save 9  million people.  Throwing in a great actor like Samuel Jackson to make up  for inadequecies in Willis' writing only mildly covers it up.  Jeremy Irons  is always great but when the BIG SCENES involve solving riddles that could  have been culled from a R.I.F. van, some writer out there didn't realize  that infusing clever puzzles make not a plot clever.  McTeirnan never  really plots a point, he just has the characters going through one scene  after another with no real progression. By the end, in an anticlimatic  ending, we feel like we've gone no where...like the NY cabbie who supposed  to take me five blocks and drives me halfway across the city.  At least all  I have to do is remember his name and I can report him.  If McTeirnan makes  too many more films like this, no ones gonna remember him, let alone write  it down...

The plot, to the extent there is one, is pretty thin. A brilliant, but insane terrorist named Simon (Jeremy Irons) has planted several bombs around New York City. If McClane doesn't do what he tells him, then he'll start exploding the bombs. (Simon says do this, Simon says do that. Get it?)
McClane spends most of his time running around the city, from pay phone to pay phone, always arriving just in the nick of time. If this sounds familiar, then you've probably seen ""Dirty Harry"" which featured the same plot device, although it was used to better effect in that film.
The story is not really what is important in this film, however. It is mainly just a framework to hang the elaborate action sequences on. There are several of those and they are good ones. A massive explosion in a subway and a scene on a cargo ship are both quite spectacular.
In action movies nowadays it is pretty tough to outdo the last blockbuster film and come up with something new. The makers of ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" have tried their best and they have done a fair job of it.

The DVD however is one of the worst I've ever seen.  Whoever mastered it turned the edge enhancement up  way too much.  You see it the minute the Fox trailer comes on the screen  everything looks too pixelated.  The outdoor seens are by far the worst,  everything appears grainy and artifacts are made more apparent.  The indoor  scenes are bad, but barable.  Nothing like the ugliness that occurs  everytime McClane steps outside.
I have this film on LaserDisc also, and  I guess I would rather watch the DVD because there is less chroma noise and  the colors are better, but it is close.  This is a good film and it  deserves a better treatment than this.  Come on Fox, get with the  program.
One more thing.  This damn thing has the default sound in  2-channel, not 5.1.  I hate that.",939859200,5,901,4.411042944785276
