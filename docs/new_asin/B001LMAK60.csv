3685598,5,B001LMAK60,"This movie had a great plot and the actors did awesome! The ninth circle of Hell that is discussed gets a person thinking, but by a choice that I've already done, I'm going to avoid all degrees of it at all costs.",1351468800,,213,4.095238095238095
3685599,2,B001LMAK60,"Here's a conversational exchange so you know what to expect.

Wife rushes up to husband:  ""Where's Jason?""

Husband:  ""I have no idea!""

Wife (claps hands to cheeks):  ""OMG!""

I missed the first fifteen minutes or so, so I can't be sure whether the fifteen-year-old virgin (Robertson) was actually raped by handsome hunk Jason (Johnston) at the noisy party or not.  Maybe it doesn't really matter because the movie isn't about rape but about the suffering that all victims go through.

Robertson suffers mightily, beginning at the hospital when she reports having been raped.  The medical staff are distant and mechanical.  The OB-GYN doctor is unfeeling and a little snotty.  She seems to flourish the cold stainless steel of the instrument she's about to insert into poor Robertson in the stirrups.  After that, the police interrogate her intensively and further humiliate her.  One of them (a woman) refers to ""the quote-unquote rape.""  And after THAT, at school, she becomes ""the school's designated germ.""  If there's anything that makes these movies about cruel teens bearable it's the occasional gem-like slang terms they come up with.

Then there's Jason's suffering.  It appears that he did in fact violate her after feeding her a date-rape drug, the kind found only in movies, that has caused the gaps in her memory that roused the suspicions of the police.  (I hope you're following all this.)  He's supernally good looking and a weight lifter and, though the girls at school say, ""I wish Jason would rape ME"", when they mock Robertson, Jason's life is ruined.  I guess he doesn't like to be thought of as having to rape anyone, though the police don't charge him, because he gets drunk one night and disappears into the icy waters of the Prospect River.

But his victimhood is weightless compared to that of Robertson's dad, Ron Eldard, the guy who was the helicopter pilot with the easy blue eyes who was shot down in ""Blackhawk Down.""  There is some evidence that Eldard had a hand in convincing Jason that it was a fine idea to jump off the bridge into the Prospect River.  So the police begin an investigation of his movements that night.

The police are about to get serious about Eldard when his wife (Preston) finally confesses that she was there when Jason, drunk, fell from the bridge.  Yes -- YES -- it was HER blood on the railing, where she scraped her wrist trying to save him!

That's four victims for the price of one.  Order right now and we'll add a fifth suffering victim!

Actually, it's not that bad.  It's stuffed with misery and guilt but it's more of a mystery than the usual tear jerker.  And it has its moments, at least in the dialog if not in the performances or the direction.  The mother and her husband are fans of Dante Alighieri for some reason, perhaps to provide the title.  When Preston tells her story of trying to save Jason, she quotes from ""The Divine Comedy"":  ""Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'entrate"", or ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"".  She adds a tenth circle of hell to Dante's nine, reserved ""for those who lie to themselves by pretending they're not hurting the ones they love.""  It was a little too deep for me and slipped past my apperceptive apparatus.

I don't mind movies shot in Canada, like this one, though there are some who believe it may be part of a Canadian scheme to milk money from Americans.  This one was shot in Nova Scotia.  It's just that, if they're going to shoot it in Toronto or Windsor or Vancouver, at least give it a sense of place, some local color.  IDENTIFY the city.  Be proud of it!  Use the names of real streets and neighborhoods.  Don't try to disguise the Canadian accents -- let a hundred ""hooses"" flourish!",1337817600,,3709,4.685271317829457
3685600,1,B001LMAK60,"These are the worst parents imaginable so it's not a surprise that their child does everything possible to destroy the lives of everyone around her. Need evidence?

1. They name their daughter Trixie. Maybe they were hoping she would have a glorious career as a Playboy Bunny.
2. They have no concerns that their 14 year old is dating a high school senior. They also don't notice when they break up and she becomes an emotional basket case.
3. They say nothing about her hanging out with a friend that has unsupervised parties with alcohol, drugs, and sex even after she is date raped at one such party.
4. They send her back to school where she is tormented by her classmates and her rapist.
5. They allow a bunch of unfeeling, uncaring adults to victimize their daughter further. Mom is unable to stop a doctor from conducting an abusive physical exam because she is too busy having an affair with one of her students. They both sit passively by while two police detectives yell at their daughter that her story is inconsistent.
6. They both do things that could end up with their daughter being arrested to cover up their own secrets.

You would think that given all this you would be sympathic towards Trixie. You would be wrong. She's annoying and idiotic in so many ways. Just skip the whole thing.",1330214400,,1304,4.592274678111588

3685604,4,B001LMAK60,"Based on best-selling novelist Jodi Picoult's ""The Tenth Circle"", this movie adaptation [first aired on Lifetime] provides a searing portrayal of a family in crisis. Freshman Trixie Stone [Britt Robertson] comes home from a party and breaks down in front of her dad Daniel [Ron Eldard], claiming an ex-boyfriend, Jason raped her. Thus begins the family's descent into 'hell', and when deeply hidden family secrets get exposed,the very fabric of the family is threatened.

Mom and wife Laura [Kelly Preston] is a college professor who is having an affair with her student and is wracked by guilt when she is absent from home during Trixie's breakdown. Dad and husband Daniel also has a secret - he was once a suspect in a murder investigation. Things get worse when Jason, the alleged rapist, is found dead in the river sometime later. Though it's initially ruled a suicide, evidence points to something else, and Daniel finds himself embroiled in a murder investigation for the second time.

Though it does play out like a made-for-TV movie, I found it quite watchable - Britt Robertson is excellent as the emotionally vulnerable Trixie and Ron Eldard is credible as the devastated father who is also struggling with his marriage. Kelly Preston's performance as Laura failed to impress and her scenes weren't that many.

The DVD has no extras [except for some movie trailers]. All in all , this is worth checking out, especially for fans of Ms Picoult [I also liked the screen adaptation of Plain Truth with Mariska Hargitay].",1234224000,11,1526,4.976470588235294

3685633,4,B001LMAK60,"This is a film of a book by Jodi Picoult about the effects an alleged date rape incident has on both families involved. Freshman Trixie Stone (Britt Robertson) accuses her ex-boyfriend Jason Underhill (Jamie Johnston) of rape; but the issue is confused by the fact that Trixie was apparently drugged and cannot remember events clearly, and she was acting provocatively at a party organized by her best friend Zepher Santorelli (Hayley Beauchamp) in order to try to win her boyfriend back from his current girlfriend. Trixie is looked after in the daytime by her father, Daniel (Ron Eldard) who works from home as an artist. Trixie's mother Laura (Kelly Preston) is a college professor whose extra-curricular activities include having an affair with one of her students. When Underhill falls from a bridge into the river and drowns, the question is whether he jumped or whether he was pushed. Father, mother and daughter all appear to have motive and opportunity. There are obvious allusions to the circles of hell in Dante's Inferno. The director of the movie was Peter Markle.",1362009600,3,1077,5.022346368715084

8318517,4,B001LMAK60,"The Tenth Circle isn't a bad movie, it's not a pleasant light viewing as it tackles some pretty heavy subject matter, like most originally made for TV movies it's a bit predictable for most parts, but really is only let down by a bad ending that seemed rushed.  I've got no idea why it was called The Tenth Circle though, maybe titles like Victim?  or Believed?, or something like that would have made more sense.

The main character in this one is Trixie, (Britt Robertson), a fifteen year old whose boyfriend an older student who has got himself an ice hockey scholarship to university, sort of breaks up with her, sort of as he can't really be bothered just lets his new girlfriend rub it in her surprised face while he pretends he doesn't notice.  Even though this is obviously a real classy guy, Trixie loved her ex boyfriend and like most teens thinks she just lost the love of her life and the world is over.  Her mother is never home as she likes to spend the night in drug dealers bedrooms because her husband, who was a bad boy when she married him, now has become in her words ""more mother than her"", he now does his hair and dresses like Keith Urban while drawing comic books.  It is little wonder Trixie has no one to help her deal with things.  No one that is except unfortunately for her friend who thinks the solution to her problem is to dress skanky, wear no underwear and flirt and make out with every other guy at a party, except her ex.  This will make him jealous and they'll be back together.  Well the dumb friend's plan sort of worked, except she didn't count on the ex raping Trixie.  Trixie now an emotional wreck tells her father she was raped who takes her to hospital, where no one really believes her story, or at least believe much of it is the truth.

The movie for most part although unpleasant, does ring true to what happens when victims speak up against popular people or at least perpetrators who they don't believe could do such a thing.  It doesn't even have to be a crime as bad as the one in this movie, I've seen victims of bullying in workplaces go through similar things Trixie does at school.  So it's a pretty believable storyline in that stretch.  However we also have things like a police vehicle pursuit that makes no sense even happening with events in this film.  Aspects such as the father being a comic book drawer that were so prominent in how he showed us his feelings at the start of the movie are never even touched on again. Surely he could have drawn some fantasy delving out justice cartoons or something, that they could have put into the plot or something but they never go there.  Plus as I said the ending is pretty weak.  Apparently the book this was based on by Jodi Picoult has a better ending, which maybe I'll check out one day.",1476489600,,2798,4.391472868217054
