7359909,4,B01316LFRG,"I was a bit generous with the 4 stars, but 3 seemed to low for this film's entertainment value.

Years ago this film initially hit the rumor mill hard and now, years after its premier release (in Asia, Europe and South America, 2015), it curiously has yet to find US distribution.  Director Will Canon is a relative newcomer to the horror game with this obscure-by-distribution filmalso released under the titles House of Horror, La Casa de Demonio, Demonsko, A Casa dos Mortos, House of the Dead and Haunted. What got me interested was that this was backed by James Wan (The Conjuring, Dead Silence).

Responding to a call at a purportedly abandoned murder house, Detective Lewis (Frank Grillo; The Purge: Anarchy, Mothers Day) finds the remnants of a satanic ritual and the mass murdered bodies of those who performed the dark rite. During Lewis investigation, we jump from the present to the past and observe the events that transpired.  Meanwhile in the present, the best answer Dr. Elizabeth Klein (Maria Bello; Assault on Precinct 13, Lights Out) questions can get from the lone survivor is the house did it!

John (Dustin Milligan; Shark Night 3D, Slither, Final Destination 3) had been having visions of his dead mother; a haunting perhaps.  He seeks the help of paranormal specialists and ghost hunters Sam (Alex Goode), Donnie (Aaron Yoo; Disturbia, Friday the 13th), Jules (Megan Park; Diary of the Dead), Michelle (Cody Horn; Magic Mike) and Bryan (Scott Mechlowicz; EuroTrip).  To quell these visions, they return to the haunted house to set up cameras, conduct an evocation (a s&eacute;ance), and try to prove the presence of spirits.  The plot is already a bit shaky here. It is suggested that his haunting will persist unless he returns to the house, but there isn't even a hint of explanation as to why.

Upon arrival to the house the camera set-up routine serves as an ice breaker in these ghost hunter and haunted house movies.  This is where the film finds its personality.  Weve seen similar scenarios in Poltergeist (1982, 2015), Grave Encounters (2011), Paranormal Activity (2007) and Insidious (2011).  We get the lay of the land, find some creepy clues, get to know our protagonists quirks, and maybe even some supernatural things happen right under our investigators noses as they position their hardware in the homes of feisty poltergeists.

This film features some found footage (maybe 25% of the movie), but it is definitely not a found footage horror.  Its not particularly awesome (yet no explanation as to why this 2015 film still hasn't had a US release in 2017), but I certainly find it entertaining.  Id even watch it again.  The atmosphere is more than creepy enough (though it pales compared to Paranormal Activity, Insidious, The Conjuring, Dead Silence, Poltergeist, etc.), theres a couple of jump scares, and couple of legit scares. While most of what we see are brief spectral figures and doors opening and shutting on their own, they seem to be executed proficiently enough to elude actively feeling old hat.  In fact, no lie, these jump scares were REALLY FUN!  Theres little to be said for clever or innovative or original content. Just good, plain, consistently capable execution for maximum jumpiness.  Its greatest shortcoming is that the story is very thin.  The end gets more than a bit wonky, but its nothing I cant forgive for the fun ride.

This honestly deserves a wide release.  It may get panned by critics, but its a fun date night, it would make money (the budget was only $3 million), and no one would leave feeling cheated.",1495843200,13,3582,4.9054726368159205

7359911,4,B01316LFRG,"Skeptical detective Mark Lewis (Frank Grillo) and his girlfriend police psychologist (Maria Bello) investigate the gruesome murders at the Martha Livingston house in Louisiana. They appear to be copy cat murders from an event from 1988. John (Dustin Milligan) who was found still alive in the house is undergoing questioning while two people are still missing.

The story as to what happened is told as a subplot as John slowly recalls. A group of paranormal investigators was in the house. It included his girlfriend and her ex-boyfriend, so there is some tension. Some of the flashback segment is hand held, but not the bad kind where all we see are feet and hear people say, ""What was that?""

The script drops all kinds of clues as to what might be going on and they finally come together at the end. I liked the film. It seemed every time things started to slow up a bit, they smartly switched scenes. Yes, it was partially hand held camera and there was a seance, but yet it seemed fresh.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Megan Park announces that she is the film's eye candy, but we don't get to see much of her.",1446249600,,1119,4.557213930348259
7359912,1,B01316LFRG,"Unnecessary twists and shoddy plot structure leave you jumping, but in a cheap way. Not a genuinely scary movie. Not one 'A' lister attached to the project either. The story is redone every single year.",1513900800,,202,4.8

7359922,3,B01316LFRG,"Three stars here means ""It's okay"". The reason I chose that rating is because this was a film that had a hell of a lot of potential and it fell wayyyyy short. The ending is left wide open and with many unanswered questions to what was built so well in the beginning and middle of this film. I was really invested in this, hoping it would turn out as a rare gem and fantastic thriller, but because of the ending, the entire movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",1510099200,,466,4.076086956521739

7359925,1,B01316LFRG,"Terrible. I'm not really sure where directors/writers/producers get their inspiration for how their characters should act, but it's certainly not real life. The characters in this movie are so unbelievable, it's painful - especially since I paid money to see this. Although, to be honest, couldn't make it to the halfway mark of the movie it was so bad.",1509840000,,353,5.0

7359932,3,B01316LFRG,"In one word, this movie is shallow. There are many films similar to this one that I am a huge fan of, so it's not genre discrimination or snobbery (promise!). The characters read like ""Hello My Name Is"" name tags. ""Brian, jealous ex,"" for example. The ending becomes predictable early in the movie, which hurts the credibility of any of the paranormal happenings (but if you aren't skeptical, the main character will help you along with constant snarky remarks). The plot reads like a paranormal word bubble exercise with time leaps and surprises in the investigation... I did like that the filming was only partially found footage, and the pace of the movie kept things moving and entertaining. It fit the mold of what I felt like watching, and it wasn't bad. Let's just say, I would recommend it to somebody to watch, but wouldn't watch it again.",1509062400,,848,4.736486486486487

7359935,3,B01316LFRG,"This movie is like all other horror movies.  It starts out good and scary, but then the ending has to be SO dumb that it kills the entire movie!  What has happened to all the good old horror films like the original Halloween?  That's still my favorite horror movie of all time.  Scream came close and Neve Campbell almost became the new scream queen, but all the sequels were almost as dumb as the Scary Movie's the Wayan Brother's did.  I was going to give this movie 5 stars while watching it because it made me jump through the whole thing and kept me totally intrigued throughout the whole thing until the very end!  I think I'm about to give up on today's horror genre.  The last one I actually did enjoy was Lights Out.  That one is actually pretty good by today's standards if you are looking for one to watch.  Otherwise, I suggest you rent before you buy this.",1508803200,3,869,4.3478260869565215

7359938,4,B01316LFRG,This was a pretty good little film. I actually ended up renting it twice over the last year. Definitely has its creepy mystery moments. Unfortunately there is no synopsis of the film on Amazon. Basically it starts out with a group of college kids deciding to check out a haunted house with a story that the haunting is caused by a seance that went bad 20 years before killing all but one of the participants. Things of course go wrong and the police arrive to find one of the participants nearly catatonic but unharmed and another missing in a house that is a bloodbath. They call in a police psychologist to try and get the guy talking as the cops try to recover the events from the damaged video used by the students in a race to understand what happened and find the missing girl.,1508457600,3,783,4.406896551724138
7359939,5,B01316LFRG,It's actually good wtf.  I have seen a few bad films that tend to do the same thing over and over again as far as paranormal type movies go but this was really good and i enjoyed the hell out of it. It's much more then your typical haunted house,1508457600,,245,3.9

7359949,2,B01316LFRG,"If your idea of a good horror film is paper-thin characters, woeful story and a reliance on jump-scares, have at it.  Otherwise avoid this one. It's all pretty predictable and run-of-the-mill.  A team of ghost-hunters with eye-roll backstories (well, three of them; the other characters are even thinner yet manage to be just as irritating) investigate a haunted house and it all goes yawnsomely wrong.  The story throws all sorts of ideas into the mix but I couldn't see one single fresh one.  There wasn't one chill.  The acting was good enough, I will say that, especially with very uneven, sometimes unconvincing dialogue to work with.
