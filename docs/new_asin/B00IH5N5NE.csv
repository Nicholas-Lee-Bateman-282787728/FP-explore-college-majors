Almost like 2 different movies as the second part shows past events that shows you why NTR is getting revenge. It is a great movie all around that you will want to watch more than once. Well worth buying.",1468800000,,341,4.2615384615384615
8642085,5,B00IH5N5NE,"Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao Jr. (born 20 May 1983), widely known as Jr. NTR, CAN DANCE!!!!! I'm sure I saw MJ in one of his dance productions. You will know what I'm saying when you see the first dance production. Great movie. Wonderful story line, great characters, and happy ending? Well he accomplished what he set out to do. I have shared this movie with so many, even posting it on Twitter, just so people can see Jr. NTR dance. If I ever see him in person, I'd scream. I've never been star struck before but this man, bring out a fan I never new was there. Best movie to watch if a guy dance troop wanted to do a dance and TRUST I don't think any dance troupe would be able to keep up with Jr. NTR and his troupe. ""It's a crazy morning, it's a crazy night, what is this LOOOOOOOVE!  WOOOO!"" A MUST WATCH!",1443657600,,808,4.146496815286624
