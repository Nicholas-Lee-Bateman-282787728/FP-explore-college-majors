8183151,5,B000O75V8U,"This is DVD is a few years old but it is still very good.  Samantha Brown stays at the Ritz Carlton Naples on the Gulf Side Beach and showcases their facilities very well.  She stays in a suite.  Other room types are not shown.  I would have liked to see a variety of rooms and the other restaurants. The french restaurant was showcased.  The service and standards are obviously impeccable.  She takes a golf lesson at the other Ritz Carlton Naples and explains both Ritz Carlton services allow you to use either hotel services and charge to your room.  Pets allowed at the Golf Resort Ritz Carlton in Naples.  She also shows other sites of Naples which include beautiful homes, museums, shopping, etc.  I would recommend this DVD.",1489968000,,731,4.6484375
