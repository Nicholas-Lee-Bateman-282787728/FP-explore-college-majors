5227718,5,B0090V4IPI,"This is one that I have been waiting on for a long time so when I saw it I made sure I snatched it up as quick as I could. There was only 3000 copies made so I made sure I got this one since I have liked this movie ever since I saw it on cable a long time ago. Its also one of the early Blake Edwards movies and it really is a delightful movie,made later as Back To School with Rodney Dangerfield but I prefer it over the remake.",1356566400,4,429,3.6739130434782608
5227719,5,B0090V4IPI,This is a very entertaining movie. Bing Crosby's personality shines through and the story has lots of excitement. It lets you experience a simpler time for a couple of hours.,1353110400,2,174,4.833333333333333
5227720,5,B0090V4IPI,"One of my all-time top 10 Bing Crosby movies. What more could you ask for great comedy, Bing singing,  and all around good fun set in a college in 1960.

Of course it would be a Bing Crosby movie with out Bing signing.  He introduces the song ""The Second Time Around.""

A great all around movie that everyone is sure to enjoy. Hard to believe it has has been 52 years since it was introduced",1351382400,2,391,4.173333333333333
5227721,5,B0090V4IPI,"Fantastic film despite the naysayers....you can't go wrong with the Bingster....he does look a little old in this film, but his voice is still right on the money.... Many have tried to compare this to Back to School but there is no comparison.... As it was made in 1960, you cannot really compare it to films made today....but it is a wonderful film to watch even if it is highly improbable.... Der Bingle goes to college at 51 years old and easily becomes one of the guys, falls in love and climbs to the top of a 75 ft. high pile of wood....sounds like when I went to college.... The video is very good given the available print, and the audio is excellent....very enjoyable film....get it....",1346889600,9,695,4.523809523809524
5227722,3,B0090V4IPI,"Blake Edwards' 1960 Fox comedy HIGH TIME finds Bing Crosby's hamburger-restaurant chain entrepreneur deciding to head back to campus and get his college degree. As the elder statesman on campus, Bing quickly becomes popular with his roommates (including Richard Beymer and Fabian), romances a French teacher (Nicole Maurey) and finds the time to dress up in drag and croon a future standard in the process.

Though written by Edwards' frequent collaborators Tom and Frank Waldman, ""High Time"" doesn't have a whole lot of slapstick antics (there's just that one bit where Bing crossdresses as part of a fraternity initiation - something that's never as amusing as it sounds). The movie is sweet and goes down nice and easy as a product of its era, but it also feels flimsy - like a book for a musical without any songs. Yes, Bing does briefly croon ""The Second Time Around,"" a lovely Sammy Cahn-James Van Heusen tune written for the film, but the movie really could've used some more musical interludes seeing as most of the film is comprised of basic, albeit peppy, montages. There's not much in the way of drama or character development here - just a series of self-contained scenes set over the course of Bing's four years at an ACC institution dubbed ""Pinehurst College"" (standing in for Wake Forest, where the film was reportedly supposed to be shot until the production decided to stay closer to home in California).

The supporting cast has its charms: Gavin MacLeod has some fun early on as a manic science teacher, a pre-""Batgirl"" Yvonne Craig plays an intrepid school journalist, and Tuesday Weld brings her warm smile as the gang's resident gal pal, but there's no real pay off to their (or any other) roles, with the movie settling for a cartoony treatment of the subject matter without much development or even laughs (in fact, Rodney Dangerfield would have much more success in the latter department in his similarly-themed 1986 hit ""Back to School"").

Now, although it probably sounds as if I'm being a bit harsh on ""High Time,"" I still enjoyed the film. Edwards' direction utilizes some visual flourishes that would come to characterize his later comedies, and Henry Mancini's wonderful score is so infectious that I was humming the main theme for some time afterwards. All it needed was a few good musical numbers to put it over the top.

The 1080p AVC encoded, Fox-sourced HD transfer is perfectly acceptable on balance - the elements are certainly in better condition than ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" another Fox Cinemascope TT release, yet the image has some obvious digital filtering applied and doesn't appear nearly as vibrant as TT's recent Blu-Ray of ""Bye Bye Birdie"" (the colors also don't leap off the screen as they do in TT's counterpart release this month). The  DTS MA stereo sound is just fine, with a stereo isolated score track of Mancini's score also available on a separate channel. The original trailer and Julie Kirgo's notes put the finishing touches on another Twilight Time 3000-copy limited edition Blu-Ray.",1346025600,,3052,4.953125
5227733,5,B0090V4IPI,Some of these older films have poor audio quality and/or audio levels that fluctuate and cause the watcher to adjust the volume a lot during the film.  This one does NOT have that issue.  Really enjoyed it.,1467849600,,206,4.54054054054054

5227737,5,B0090V4IPI,"charming movie, of course reminiscent of it's years later successor, Back To School which pales in comparison; the cast is splendid, Headed by Bing, Tuesday Weld, Nicole Maurey, Fabian and Richard Beymer (and a nebbishy Gavin MacLeod) it is a wistful look back at the campus hijinks that ensued at your typical - albeit all white- university in the 60's; Love is in the air as we see Bing and his campus colleagues grow from freshmen to seniors, and Bing falling in love with his lovely French professor and serenading her with the winsome ""Second Time Around"".
great fun, but at this price, I can wait until it is in wider release - the same thing happened with Journey to the Centre of the earth- - a ""limited release"" retailing for 99.99, now available for under $12.00",1443312000,,772,4.642335766423358

5227740,5,B0090V4IPI,This little-know Blake Edwards movie is finally given a good release.  There is a cheapo DVD version that is pan and scan.  It is not very good.  This Blu-ray limited edition is excellent.  Recommended.,1437609600,,202,4.852941176470588
5227741,5,B0090V4IPI,"This is nothing more than a Class A version of the Avalon-Funicelli Beach Party fliks of the early 60s. The plot is simple: a middle-aged millionaire decides to get a College education and, in the process, gets tangled up in student high jinks. The lead is played by legendary Bing Crosby who wisely (as he produced the film) cast the middle-aged and lovely French actress Nicole Maurey as his romantic interest thus leaving the young romance stuff to be split among the then promising future stars at 20th Century (Fabian, Richard Beymer, Tuesday Weld and Yvonne Craig - the latter becoming the future TV Batgirl).

It is all quite innocent with a lot of Blake Edwards sight-gags and a bouncy pace to go with Henry Mancinis irresistible and bouncy score. This film may not be up there with Edwards Breakfast nor Pink Panther classics, but its a lot better than his Operation Petticoat or Perfect Furlough.

The blu-ray release has completely gotten rid of all of the annoying graininess produced by all of those wipe opticals that were employed for the many time transitions. Therefore the film looks a hundred percent better than it did on its first theatrical release.

If you like an upbeat good time thats fit for the entire family, you could do no better, but if you prefer raunch, better skip this one. The only pity is the stiff Twilight Time price tag with (as yet) no regular DVD option.",1423440000,2,1397,4.717213114754099
5227742,5,B0090V4IPI,"Is there a DVD release in the works, as well as this blu-ray? I like this movie. It's fun watching Crosby go to college as a middle aged man in the early 60s and all the stuff he gets involved in, and the ending is cuter than cute.

Please put it out on DVD too.",1418601600,,262,3.7636363636363637

5227774,3,B0090V4IPI,"Despite starring Bing Crosby towards the end of his days as a leading man, High Time is one of the most forgotten of Blake Edwards comedies, and its not too surprising. Its a thin comedy built around a simple idea  Bings millionaire businessman decides to go to college alongside Fabian, Richard Beymer and Tuesday Weld  that it never really does that much with. In fact, its almost plotless, a string of brief scenes, few of which ever develop into full blown comic setpieces and which do little more than show the passage of time from one year to the next. Theres little in the way of character development or even character scenes, with montage the preferred approach and longer scenes surprisingly few and far between: a Confederate ball with Bings new pledge in drag for an initiation dare, scavenging wood for a bonfire (a sequence that shows Edwards love of silent sight gags) and a scene where Bing ill-advisedly takes his roomies out to eat at one of his restaurants the most memorable. But generally none of the cast have much to do and nothing much happens until the writers decide to throw in a few unconvincing romantic complications with French teacher Nicole Maurey in the last third and add a few songs (The Second Time Around for Bing and The Foggy Foggy Dew for Fabian) to keep the fans happy.

As Julie Kirgos liner notes in Twilight Times limited edition Blu-ray note, its the kind of determinedly innocent depiction of teenagers and varsity life that was already out of date in 1960, but with the passing of another five decades its very old-fashionedness gives it a nave cosiness thats hard to hold against it. The films only real ingenuity is reserved for a series of delightful and consistently imaginative scene transitions as scenes are frozen and painted over to make way for new ones, leaves blow away, snow is swept away or captions rolled up like a carpet to reveal the next scene to the accompaniment of Henry Mancinis jaunty score. Sadly even these become more conventional as the film hits the home stretch and it does perhaps feel like Edwards was trying to give the film some personality that wasn't in the script (reworked from a Gary Cooper project when his illness caused him to drop out of the film), but while it never amounts to much, the film is a pleasant enough diversion.

Twilight Times Blu-ray offers a very decent widescreen transfer in the original CinemaScope ratio with extras limited to isolated score, booklet and trailer, the latter featuring a fair amount of deleted footage including a number by Fabian that didn't make the final cut of the film (theres also another number listed in the credits that doesnt appear in the film).",1401926400,2,2684,4.753218884120171
5227775,2,B0090V4IPI,"What an odd film this is, especially as a vehicle for Bing Crosby. The premise is a self made, very wealthy businessman, who wants to earn a college degree. A 51 year old widower, his son and daughter are mortified at their father's implacable decision to pursue his dream of the college experience. Directed by Blake Edwards, with a Henry Mancini score (a match that would sizzle for the 1961 classic, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's), it is an episodic rendering of what dorm life was like in the very late 1950s. A huge star in Crosby, the film had something for everyone ~ Crosby would do no wrong with the older set, while teens would flock to see Fabian, Tuesday Weld (who is largely wasted here), and Richard Beymer. Beymer, of course, would be cast as Tony in the film version of ""West Side Story"" ~ one wonders if this role led to that controversial bit of casting. French actress, Nicole Maurey, is lovely as a potential romantic interest for Der Bingle and, in my opinion, is the best reason to watch this film. The Oscar-nominated, Sammy Cahn- Jimmy Van Heusen, ""The Second Time Around"" is introduced here. It is a perfectly pleasant film, but way TOO long and plot twists and non sequitors that are... interesting.",1395878400,3,1219,4.648148148148148

5227781,4,B0090V4IPI,"The old crooner could act, but this movie's theme did not call for high intensity.  It is a mixture of romp and serious scenes.  I remembered it from my movie watching in the theater days, and I watched it with as much pleasure on my widescreen LCD screen.  My wife, however, found it to be too stilted and juvenile for her tastes, and refused to watch enough to 'get into it'.  I enjoyed the part where Bing proves that Love does not die from one maturing, but that it can bloom long after one's children think it is somehow improper for their widowed father to fall in love again.  Of course, they also thought it folly for him to seek a college degree after becoming wealthy as a businessman!  So you can imagine some of the possible conflicts!  Watch it with an open mind, one that can relish the changing moods of the tale, the fresh take on Mature Love, and you will find it a pleasure!",1369440000,2,892,4.3053892215568865

8533510,5,B0090V4IPI,"High Time is a wonderful Bing Crosby vehicle that has a successful middle aged businessman with grown children (and a widower) indulging a whim by taking a step back in his life to get the college education he missed the first time around.

While a seeming slam dunk to be a ""fish out of water"" comedy, instead Crosby's character finds a way to integrate successfully with his younger classmates, learning from them as they also benefit from his experience.

This is a wonderful film that stands up well. Things such as fall bonfires were and still are common campus traditions. Fraternity pledging pranks ... still around. Dormitories ... still around. Hamburger/Barbecue restaurants ... still around. LOL

Is the movie a touch simple and innocent compared to modern life and modern comedy fare? Sure it is. But trust me, that is NOT a bad thing.

Sit back and enjoy this very entertaining and relaxing film.",1503792000,,909,4.883116883116883
