8366538,5,B002DZIDHC,"This story is told in flashback, and is sad and tragic, because of someone who was jealous and didn't stop at nothing to reach her goals.

Elisa (Marina Tamayo) lives with her godfather (Joaquin Pardave) and one day she meets Jorge (Emilio Tuero), who, nobody know how, is a four time widower. All women run away from him, but not Elisa, who falls in love at first sight.
After some time they get married and the problems begin when she arrives at his castle, which he shares with his step-sister Cristina (Isabela Corona).
Cristina (daughter of Christ), should have been named Evila, because she has a dark soul. She secretly loves her brother and doesn't allow other women to live in that castle long enough to give him a child. Cristina was born out of wedlock and was raised in the belief that she was a maid (with those dresses and ostrich lashes she look too refined to be one), but now she knows the whole truth and can not help but to keep loving the man she didn't know was her brother..

Somehow Elisa manages to have a baby, but then Cristina steals it, locking herself in her room and not letting anybody see the baby. After long nights of begging to let them see him, Cristina changes her plans and allow the baby to stay with his parents but now she will use any excuse to make Jorge believe his wife is being unfaithful. And when she accomplishes that, Jorge throws Elisa out and Cristina makes the baby (and eventually the boy) believe she is his real mother.
Elisa won't rest until the truth sees the light and one day returns to the castle, with fatal results!
The best movie from the Isabela Corona collection.",1316822400,2,1629,4.481481481481482
