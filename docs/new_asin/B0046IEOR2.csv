4270134,5,B0046IEOR2,"There is no way to measure how important this DVD set is to the history of Television. Starting with episodes originally broadcast in the 1940s (and there are so few of those available for the public to purchase) and going to the mid-1950s, these priceless programs show just how creative, charming and adventuresome early Television really was.

Burr Tillstrom was a genius, and Fran Allison had both the poise and talent to do live television without a script, only the barest bones of an outline guiding her performance and interaction with Tillstrom's Kuklapolitan puppets. Stir in all of the original commercials, and those of us who remember when or want to learn about when TV was really Television will be delighted with this DVD set. Hurry and buy this before they run out!",1293148800,3,782,4.879699248120301
4270135,5,B0046IEOR2,The DVD is nothing less than priceless!!  To see these programs again after 60 years is beyond words. I actually remember some of the segments. Many hours went into restoring the old kinescopes resulting in great pictures and sound.  You don't have to have been raised in Chicago to enjoy this DVD.  A true treasure of early television.,1290470400,31,336,4.758620689655173

4270140,5,B0046IEOR2,"When I first saw these shows in the 50's I was very young and didn't think much of them.  Watching them now I can see that a lot of it went right over my tousled head.  The shows vary in quality but even the worst of them is still good and the best are brilliant.  ""Salute to Television"" is still funny despite the dated references. The one in Vol 2 where the gang respond to a dismissive New Yorker review is wonderful.  Likewise their version of ""Destination Moon"" (as a musical no less).  My only complaint is that they don't have the one where Beulah Witch gets in trouble with the FAA.  The style might be described as ""banter"" since most of it is ad lib dialogue between the characters.  There was no actual script and each episode had only a general story arc with the details filled in as they went along, mostly by Burr Tilstrom helped by Fran Allison.  This is kind of high wire act is great to watch and the results are often amazingly good.",1402012800,2,952,4.279329608938547
4270141,5,B0046IEOR2,Vaguely remembered KFO from my youth but viewing it now is an absolute joy as an adult!  Enjoying all three volumes.,1388275200,,116,4.523809523809524
4270142,5,B0046IEOR2,A NISE COLLECTION OF MEMORIES OF KUKLA FRAN AND OLLIE AND THE CREW OF THE SHOW. I WATCHED IT OVER 65 YRS AGO AND IT BROUGHT BACK MANY MEMORIES,1369440000,,142,3.9310344827586206
4270143,5,B0046IEOR2,"Such gentle, loving, tender humor that even Fran's friendly puppets come to life in amazing ways. This is a must-see for today's kids who never knew the fun of the KF&O show.",1355875200,,174,4.46875
4270144,4,B0046IEOR2,"The dvd is fun to watch for many reasons. Nostalgia is one. Historical perspective. Early broadcasting. Its a gem for historical reference and study. I bought this hoping that a favorite episode would be included.  It wasn't.  And in watching the whole set, I was disappointed for this reason. However, I think the value of this CD could be of historical interest if you're studying theatre, film, puppetry, language, etc. It was really cool to see the old commercials, the old technology, and to hear the language used decades ago.",1354579200,,532,4.9
4270145,5,B0046IEOR2,"I remember watching Kukla, Fran, and Ollie when I was four years old.
Maybe some of the episodes I watched are on this DVD!  My memory isn't great
enough to remember specific episodes, but what a pleasure to travel back into
the past and relive some childhood memories.",1322179200,,269,4.604166666666667
4270146,5,B0046IEOR2,"A lot of people these days settle for television that doesn't make you want to put your foot through the screen. Kukla, Fran and Ollie is for the rest of us, the ones who think that TV can be magic if it's properly motivated.

This collection of shows from the program's incredibly clever original run is one of those DVD sets that, if somebody else hadn't brought it to market, I would've had to figure out how to do it myself. I can't imagine doing a better job at it, however. With 20 complete episodes taken from a list of Burr Tillstrom's favorites, it's an excellent value for the money, all in very good (kinescope) quality.",1317686400,,631,4.439655172413793
4270147,5,B0046IEOR2,"The Kukla, Fran & Ollie DVD is excellent. Simply watching the first of the 20 kinescopes was payback for the cost! Love those Kuklapolitan Players!!!!!",1306281600,4,151,5.08
4270148,5,B0046IEOR2,"I was really impressed with the quality of the audio and video restoration of these kinescopes. As a result, there is nothing interfering with these great episodes of KF&O. Even if you're too young to remember when this show aired, it is a wonderful look at early television.",1298764800,5,275,4.75
4270149,5,B0046IEOR2,"I was about 4 or 5 in '55 when my parents would put Kukla, Fran & Ollie on. I owe a lot of my sense of humor to this show.
Love it.",1295395200,,131,3.125
4270150,5,B0046IEOR2,"This set is really a joy to watch.  Honestly, this HAS to have been one of the hardest to see of all the early television classics.  I've loved ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie"" since I watched the later color version of their show in the 70s, and I've sought out what's been made available over the years-- which, as others have noted, has been precious little.  Let's hope this DVD helps make this show less undeservingly rare.  There's humanity, wit, spontaneity, and charm to burn in this set, and being able to watch such a big chunk of episodes really hits home what a genius this Burr Tillstrom was.

The episodes are all top notch.  The selection chosen for this  set gives you a really good cross section not only of the range of types of episodes they did, but also how the show evolved as it adapted to different time formats.  The songs are all terrific.  The fact that the show lasted for 10 years in it's initial run is a testament to the repartee between Burr Tillstrom and Fran Allison, but just as entertaining  is the interaction between the Kuklapolitans and the mostly unseen crew who you can frequently hear laughing off-screen.  The look of early kinescopes is what it is, and a lot of care has clearly gone into making these DVDs looks as good as they do  (I can testify they look considerably better than any the very few episodes that have been available out there, in fact.)

For all it's antiquated technology, these shows really hold their own when stacked up against  modern TV shows--even the best of them.  Even though we're now living in a time when there's quite a lot of live television on the air again,  we take it as a given that people are reading their lines off of a teleprompter and that the viewing experience is going to be heavily edited one.  Here a single camera stares unflinchingly as a master performance artist (and his equally creative partner) improvise their way through a  germ of an idea on a a single stage that is so simple it's almost stark.  Compared to today's standards, KFO looks positively avant garde.  This show looks like nothing that's on the air today, and it's very uniqueness makes it particularly refreshing.",1295308800,25,2169,4.584415584415584
4270151,5,B0046IEOR2,"What a delight to see Kukla, Ollie, and Fran Allison again.  They are still adorable after all these years.  It was interesting to note how much of the humor would have gone over the head of 8, 9 and 10 year olds.  The crew had a good time and the kids loved it too.  Highly recommeded if you're an over 60 kid.",1295049600,4,311,3.967741935483871
4270152,5,B0046IEOR2,"Just got the new DVD set yesterday and am knocked out by the sound and picture restoration. Incredible job! Really takes me back. This was probably one of the first things I ever saw on TV back in the late 40s and early 50s, along with Hopalong Cassidy movies. KFO was, perhaps, the greatest improv ""group"" of all time! I don't think Burr and Fran ever used a script. Many thanks for bringing these shows back in such grand style!",1294185600,9,430,4.3875
4270153,5,B0046IEOR2,"I've been hoping for decades that these programs would come to light again. The DVD set, a huge restoration project, holds hours and hours of joy. The shows are timeless, conjured up spontaneously by the humanity, skill, and wit of Burr and Fran.  The love and music in their beautiful, good hearts fill the stage.  Watching again 60 years later, I notice how much ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie"" has been imitated by shows and entertainers that followed.  I realize too how much it influenced my life - it was my first experience of theater. The Kuklapolitans not only lift your spirit, they let you in close, remind you of your own originality, and give you courage to wear your heart on your sleeve.",1294099200,7,694,4.626016260162602
4270154,5,B0046IEOR2,"For me, viewing these episodes is a visit to my childhood.  Before our family owned a television set I used to ride in my wagon to watch Kukla, Fran, and Ollie in the window of the local radio store .  KFO, as we called it then, was a show that I seldom missed.  It was unique then, and remains so to this day.  Here was a show for children that appealed to adults as well. The pace is probably a little slow for todays 'wired' generation, and black and white television is all but forgotten, but the music is charming and the action is genuine.  The producers of this DVD did a fine job cleaning up the old kinescope recordings.",1294012800,2,629,4.208333333333333
