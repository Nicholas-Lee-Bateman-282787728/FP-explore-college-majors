8386448,5,B003102JK0,"I have to be honest.  I have a personal connection to this dvd because I am good friends with Michael Johnson (the second guitarist in the band). I live in Houston and had the opportunity to see Joe Hughes play several times in the mid 80's and into the early 90's.  I am a guitarist and also a huge fan of the blues.  From a guitarists point of view this has wonderful shots of both Joe and Michael playing.

The video is wonderfully clear to watch!  It's not grainy or filled with so many quick camera shots that it makes you dizzy.

The audio is also excellent!  You can hear each instrument clearly coming through, especially both guitars(since it was a guitar driven band)

Joe is an authentic Texas guitar slinger.  He grew up with and played with the late Johnny Clyde Copeland and Albert Collins in the 5th ward in Houston.  Johnny and Albert left Houston to find their own success and Joe stayed in Houston.

If you walked into a club in Houston around this time.....this is band you would see.  They would be playing their butts off into the morning!  If you want to hear authentic blues coming out of Houston go get this dvd!",1280102400,2,1136,4.403846153846154
8386449,4,B003102JK0,"This concert was filmed in The Netherlands, in 1988. Joe ""Guitar"" Hughes & his band, were from Houston, Texas. Joe died from a heart attack during 2003. This is a great, electric blues concert, however, it does not have a running time of 120 minutes, as described in the Amazon Product Description. I'm not sure of the offical running time, its not included in the dvd package, but I'd estimate it to be around 60 minutes, excluding the bonus material. If this concert was longer, I'd probably give it a 5 star rating.

Even though this is only a fairly short concert, it is excellent Texas Blues. Joe has a great backing band, some of the members even wear Cowboy Hats. Joe even wears a Cowboy hat at one point in the show, but he took it off because, he said it bothered him while performing. His band includes both Black & White members. Joe is an excellent blues guitarist & vocalist, plus he has another great guitarist backing him up, Michael Johnson.

The band line-up is as follows:
Joe ""Guitar"" Hughes - vocals & electric guitar
Teddy Reynolds - piano
Michael Johnson - electric guitar
George Brown - electric bass guitar
Warren Grant - drums

This concert contains some great guitar solos. Joe & Michael play very well together. The rest of the band are great also.

The song list:
1. Hideaway (written by Freddy King)
2. Going Fishing (written by Taj Mahal)
3. If You Want to See The Blues (written by Joe Hughes)
4. You Know I Love You (written by R.B.King/J.Taub)
5. Stuff Like That (written by Joe Hughes)
6. Let's Have a Natural Ball (written by T.Bone Walker)
7. Joe Hughes Blues (written by Joe Hughes)
8. The Things I Used to Do (written by Eddie Jones from New Orleans)
9. I Wanna Boogie (written by Joe Hughes - this song includes some ""samples"" of ZZ Top's ""La Grange"", ""haw, haw, haw, haw, to that Texas town..."", it's a great song).

The bonus portion includes: Biography, Picture Gallery, and according to the information on the dvd package, it's suppose to have previews of other dvds, of lesser known blues musicians. However, when I choose this option, I only got one other preview. They call this line of lesser known blues artists the ""Swingmaster Series"".",1268352000,2,2185,4.60668380462725
