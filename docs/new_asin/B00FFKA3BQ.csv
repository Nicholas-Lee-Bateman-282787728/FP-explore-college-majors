5990553,4,B00FFKA3BQ,"I picked this movie because it looked lonely and hadn't been reviewed yet.  Which, as it turned out, was oddly appropriate.

The movie is a semi-automated feature with blocky, low frame-rate, line drawing animation over photographic backgrounds.  Despite the primitive animation, the human expressions are surprisingly expressive even in rather clunky line drawings.  The soundtrack is similarly simple and seems to be comprised mostly of whistling.  The only real disadvantage of this primitive format is that it is at times hard to tell exactly who's talking.

The story is fairly familiar; our protagonist is respected by no one and generally taken advantage of for the purposes of mockery or money or whatever else.  He revolves in this sad little spiral trying to make contact with other people and build meaningful relationships to no avail.  Anything else I say would constitute a spoiler so I'll shut up there.  You get the idea.

Artistically I like the film; the blockish animation gave the whole thing a rather anonymous every-man feel because, well, this could be any of us.  We all have our insecurities from vague to specific and any one of us could be in this position.  From a plot perspective, I was less impressed.  The things that you would expect to happen happened but not for any real good reason.  There's no conclusion per se, just progress.  It's a very gentle and inconclusive film but still worth it for the point it has to make about human experience.  So a good deal for free most certainly.

8615302,5,B00FFKA3BQ,"Interesting animation style, simple yet soulful.  The story, such as it is, simply relates to a timid man trying to make his way in the world.  As an interesting device, they bring forth his alter ego, someone who looks like him, with the same deficiencies, but who has made it.  Presents the idea that Antonio could likewise succeed with the proper attitude and determination.  Maintains your interest wondering what will happen and how he will respond.",1515715200,,454,4.934210526315789
8615303,1,B00FFKA3BQ,"This film was horribly depressing and boring.  Only potential upside, if your life really sucks, you might feel slightly better about it.  At least you're not a pathetic cartoon.",1500508800,,178,5.103448275862069

8615306,1,B00FFKA3BQ,It's a cartoon.  I didn't realize it.  I watched only 1 minute.,1449100800,,63,4.166666666666667
8615307,4,B00FFKA3BQ,"This is a nice little independent film with a contemporary setting.  It's a subtitled Colombian animated feature about a title character with low self esteem and few friends. He decides to enroll in a self help group for the better while also befriending a new boss and dealing with a gambling addicted brother. I caught this on a plane ride home and was pleasantly surprised. It's a relatively charming and low key indie film. For those who love Pixar or superheroes, this is not your movie.",1434499200,,492,4.72093023255814
8615308,2,B00FFKA3BQ,"It had me intrigued but the animation was distasteful. I don't like that the characters would wiggle even though they were standing still. This was not easy on the eyes. Some of the subtitles had mistakes, but most of them were decent.",1420156800,,235,4.619047619047619
8615309,4,B00FFKA3BQ,Capture the daily life and battles people who can't speak up for themselves to the T. A lessons that we should all treat each other with more kindness. You never know what battles people are fighting,1418428800,,199,4.555555555555555
8615310,4,B00FFKA3BQ,"When we selected this movie to watch, we had no idea that it was animated or even what the plot was.  The animation was not the usual slick production but was complementary to the plot.  It was amazing to see that while there were no explosions, no sex scenes and no physical violence, there was depth to the characters and the story line.  Interestingly the ""happy ending"" was not what I would have expected but it was no less satisfying.  I would recommend this thoughtful movie to anyone looking for character development and who find people interesting.  This movie demonstrates that even ordinary people can be fascinating.",1402444800,,628,4.831775700934579
8615311,3,B00FFKA3BQ,"Actually, I did not watch this movie. I started it but it seemed to be an animated film and I don't care for that type of movie. When I was a kid, i watched cartoons like everybody but as an adult, animated feature films are not my preference. Anyway, I can't really state how good the movie was since I only saw a few minutes of it.",1399593600,,333,3.985074626865672
