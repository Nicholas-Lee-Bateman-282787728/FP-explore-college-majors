8183240,5,B000O75F7M,"This early release has been followed by a few other compilations from various sources now. This is a collection from various episodes, arranged to resemble one complete show. Quality is good. The three listed major guest artists were never on the same show together (tv.com). Don't forget Rowlf the muppet dog has two segments. They put in a clip at the end where Jimmy reads a letter from ABC announcing that his show is accepted for a permanent run. So it went 3 seasons. It's good for what it intended to be.",1505865600,,511,4.565217391304348

8183242,2,B000O75F7M,As usual Jimmy Dean only let his guests play a verse of their songs...he always has to be the show. There is nothing worse than a man that thinks he's funny and isn't,1228176000,7,166,4.0606060606060606
8183243,3,B000O75F7M,"This was just a single episode of the Jimmy Dean show (not a ""best of"" DVD.)

Still, it was lots of fun.

Rowlf the dog (of Muppets fame) shows up in the show a couple times.",1197244800,7,174,3.8055555555555554
