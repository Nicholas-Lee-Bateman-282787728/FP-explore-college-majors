625908,5,6303341713,"Indeed, Opera Imaginaire sets us free with the magical arias like ""Au fond du Temple Saint"", ""Viens Mallika"", ""Vesti la giubba"" and other popular ones. The clever animation and artwork give images to the opera greats. And one does not have to be an opera buff to enjoy the works of these short-film makers. When I got it in 1995, I loved it so much that I went out and bought another, just for spare. And later, bought a copy of the CD-I format!!
This collection of works by PASCAVISION uses Music by great singers like Corelli, Gedda, Lucia Popp and Carlo Bergonzi, and others, all licensed from EMI and DECCA.
Although these are different types of animation, Opera Imaginaire is a most delightful collection altogether. More than ARIA, which has ten film directors setting the music of the opera greats to images on film. The film directors include Altman, Godard, Jarman, Ken Russell etc....but the films, though individually interpreted, are very inaccessible indeed.
**UPDATE 16TH OCTOBER 2002** I HAVE NOW A DVD RELEASE OF THIS OPERA IMAGINAIRE WITH THE FULL PROGRAM IN DTS, DOLBY DIGITAL AND DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1, REGION CODE 3 AND 6 IN 4:3 ASPECT. ALTHOUGH SUBTITLES AND MENU ARE OFFERRED IN CHINESE/ENGLISH/ORIGINAL, THEY CAN BE SELECTED ON OR OFF. MASTERING IS GOOD AND SOUND IS GREAT. I CAN NOW THROW OUT MY WORN-OUT VHS(3RD COPY). I JUST WANT TO SHARE THIS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE FOUND THIS TITLE ENJOYABLE, MOVING...FOR THEIR FAMILY AND THEMSELVES...",922406400,14,1458,4.883064516129032
7843723,5,6303341713,"Fabulous, despite its age.  I was given this by one of my ESL graphic artists in France an eternity ago, and I was swept away and impressed...it is still lovely after all these years (I had it made into a DVD!)",1480204800,,210,4.121951219512195
7843724,1,6303341713,"My mother got me and my siblings into classical music from a very early age, and often checked out VHS videos of classical music/operas in the day. One day she checked this out, and I was forever scarred. This is NOT the kind of thing I'd show my children if I had any!
Now, to give Opera Imagionaire credit, some of the animation (particularly the 2-D animation) is unique and even beautiful. And some of the selections are fun (like The Marriage of Figaro or The Magic Flute). But most of the selections of the opera extracts are dark, depressing, sometimes even violent-not exactly a good introduction to opera for young children, if you ask me.
But it's not so much the selection of extracts that bothers me-it's the imagery! While not all of it is terrifying, the bits that are will stick in children's minds long after watching the movie. The very first extract shows murder by clown. And the last selection (from Puccini's Tosca) has some of the most terrifying characters I have ever seen in either live action or animated film.
As one previous reviewer said, this is more geared towards the more mature younger audience. If you want to give your children a positive, nightmare-free introduction to classical music or opera, this is not the kind of thing to start them off with.",1444953600,,1286,4.669603524229075
7843725,5,6303341713,"It doesn't get better than this for musical animation. We've watched this so many times, my son did, too, even though it's very uncool for boys to like opera. This production really inspired my deeper interest in opera. A must-see.",1408579200,,231,4.8

7843728,5,6303341713,"While probably geared towards a more mature younger audience there's no reason that a small child couldn't enjoy this as well. Although there is implied violence and nudity in parts of the animation it is tastefully done and actually quite compelling and artistic. Imagine that! The scenes are beautiful, emotional and riveting and seem more like watching a series of watercolor paintings in progress than a ""cartoon"" with opera music.",1175040000,,435,5.228571428571429
7843729,5,6303341713,"I bought this years ago for nieces and nephews who loved it. Rebought it recently when my grandson was 9 months old. Now, at 15 months, when he stays with us, it's the on;y thing he wants to see(over and over). He now hums and dances to the music and jabbers at the screen. I wish there was a sequel! This is such an incredible, painless and pleasurable way to introduce children(and adults) to the incredible world of opera",1133913600,,424,4.379746835443038
7843730,5,6303341713,"that there wasn't more of it.  Someone should do a sequel; there are so many wonderful arias and choruses that could be treated.

Here in the US we think of animation as being primarily for children, but in Europe and Japan this is not so. Hence, I would warn parents that this is NOT kid stuff; it isn't [...], far from it, but opera deals with some rather heavy themes, and these selections do not shy away from them.

Each selection is animated by a different artist in a very different style; some I liked better than the others, but all were interesting.",1099958400,3,559,4.407766990291262
7843731,5,6303341713,Watching this Video was the best experience of my life....  I have cried at the end...That's all I can tell...you have to taste it...,966729600,,133,4.541666666666667
7843732,5,6303341713,First I saw it on the local TV and was so hooked up that made all possible efforts to find it somewhere to buy. I bought it from the USA and spent literally tens of hours watching/listening to it again and again. Very  creative graphics (though sometimes too simple for my taste) is different  for every single aria. The voices are terrific and picture quality is very  good. Highly recommend that to all opera lovers.,959817600,,418,4.546666666666667
