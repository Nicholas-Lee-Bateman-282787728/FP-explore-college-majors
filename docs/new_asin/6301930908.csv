382999,3,6301930908,"This is an anti-war movie with a very unique plot.  If it's been used elsewhere I'm not aware of it. Set near the end of the cold war, the film is about two doppelgnger military officers, Soviet and American colonels, whose service in Afghanistan and Vietnam have left them bitter and disillusioned.  The death of a dissident trying to cross the border between West Germany and Czechoslovakia sparks a pissing match between the two colonels that develops into a a childish exchange of escalating violence with potentially far reaching consequences. Harry Dean Stanton's performance as an American general is excellent. The plot is original, fast-paced and interesting with some unexpected twists and an exciting, well-choreographed denouement.",1353801600,,743,5.396551724137931
383000,5,6301930908,"I knew the movie from when it was first released. It is a good movie to watch about two old war heroes that can't let go.

They fight up to the point of physical exhaustion. Both of them are ""products"" of their era, one being a Vietnam vet, the other an Afghanistan vet.

Both kill their military careers in the long run, but that's fairly unimportant to them, they need to slug it out with each other.",1352937600,2,402,4.207792207792208
383001,5,6301930908,"What ever all the others wrote, I live in Germany and know this time of cold war - 30 km behind the borderline. Vehicles are not authentic, helicopter too - but the message is another, it could have caused the next war for sure.
Both are very good soldiers, but forgotten, the new time is different. But thank you - to you all - who came to Germany and to be with us against the communists. Germany would have had its reunification much earlier without all Nato's soldiers. But today we have freedom and friendship to all our neighbors and to russia to!
I give 5 Stars, 3 for the movie and two for the other votes wich were too bad (my opion).",1352592000,4,643,4.235772357723577
383002,2,6301930908,"Unable to accept their new role in the era of Glasnost, a US colonel and his Russian counterpart stationed on a remote spot along the West German-Czechoslovakian border find themselves escalating a border incident into a private war in an attempt to define their identity and justify their existence in a world that is rapidly outgrowing them.

Looks great on paper, doesn't it?

In former triumphs such as Seven Days in May and The Manchurian Candidate, director John Frankenheimer at his best had shown himself a master of both the military mindset and the political thriller, so you could be forgiven for having high expectations for The Fourth War. But Frankenheimer's best work was back in the sixties and he was a distinctly on-off director since Black Sunday in 1976. Good little films like 52 Pickup and Year of the Gun have alternated with outright stinkers like The Holcroft Covenant, with his directorial style proving similarly erratic.

Sadly, this ill-starred effort is right down in the gutter with the worst of them. All the tell-tale signs of one of his off-days are here, not least some very weird camerawork and some painfully missed cues. But the real weakness lies with the script.

The idea is intriguing but is never properly developed. Instead it opts for stock situations and dialogue that even in 1990 was well past its sell-by date as this metaphor. Lara Harris' role is as unconvincing as her performance, while Prochnow remains a cipher, relegated to the background for most of the running time - a tragedy for the film, since his credible performance is its sole real asset. A brilliant actor at his considerable best, he never really got a decent English-speaking role.

Even the reliable Roy Scheider, more like a professional lawyer than a professional soldier, and Harry Dean Stanton, reduced to an unconvincing and surprisingly stilted Robert Mitchum impersonation, disappoint. Moments almost work, usually when the adversaries' confrontations are deprived of dialogue, and it often looks good. But it is never more than the kind of bad movie that makes for a good trailer: what's there just isn't enough for more than a soundbite File under major missed opportunity.",1203033600,,2202,5.038461538461538
383003,3,6301930908,"The best element of this movie is the vintage Porsche 356
which Scheider's colonel character drives.  Stanton's general
is totally miscast, but his acting is superb.  What really
irked me was the failure to set the scene to at least look
something like Germany.  Other than some snow and evergreens,
it was obviously filmed in the states or maybe Canada.  The roads
and building types are all wrong.  Ignoring all the negatives,
this movie is still quite entertaining.  Stanton's character
saved it.",1013040000,5,499,5.024390243902439
383004,2,6301930908,"If you are a cold war film buff then you might like this just to be a completist but for general viewing it stinks! Forget it! It is just too contrived both in terms if plot and action. The fight scene, for example. No one would be able to stand all those hits and still be able to fight and what was all that when Schneider floats under the ice and pops up ready to fight again. Some of what you show has to be at least a little believable. This isn't! It has a cold war theme but it is, just as another reviewer says, just a Rambo spin off.",986428800,4,542,3.891891891891892
383005,2,6301930908,"I purchased the 'Forth War' because I am a fan of Jurgen Prochnow and I am something of a Cold War scenario romantic. Jurgen's acting is less credible in 'The Fourth War' than in his other movies such as 'Dune' and 'Das Boot' and the same could be said for Scheider. This is not a movie about acting ability. Nor it the plot overly convincing. Actually it becomes rather comical and ridiculous. As I continued to watch, it progressively degraded into a 'Red Scorpion' type war flick. You know the type: lame attempts to turn normal helicopters into helicopter gunships by slinging on gigantic rocket pods  (I'll give them credit for using a Russian Mi-4 Hound Helicopter at least!), hung-ho military lingo that doesn't quite cut it, lame jokes, that annoying dubbed on machine gun bullet sound, out of sync recoil from guns etc. One thing however, no one gets killed in this movie so it doesn't stoop to the level where incompetent Russian soldiers are gunned down with relative impunity. To sum this film up - It's a cheap copy of Rambo but doesn't quite deliver the same degree of action. Watch-able if you are a demented sicko like me who actually can enjoy such crap!",974937600,7,1171,4.657004830917875
383006,4,6301930908,"I have been a huge fan of Jurgen Prochnow and here is another great performance, and Roy Schnieder puts on a good show as well.  Sometimes the movie can get a little bit silly, but everything makes up for it.",964483200,2,208,4.2
383007,5,6301930908,"I first saw this film several years ago.  It's about two soldiers, a Russian and an American, stationed on either side of the iron curtain in Czechoslovakia.  They start a war of wills that nearly escalates into a  major military confrontation.  I thought it was excellent, and suspenseful  to the very end.",947721600,6,307,4.826923076923077
383113,5,6301930908,"It's basically a movie concerning two military officers, who have to be more like diplomats than combat soldiers. The absence of war doe not sit well with them. They carry out their own little private battle, they fail to realize it's not about them, it's the whole world could be on war footing because of their selfishness. They realize at the end, what they can ignite because of their own feuds.",1463356800,,399,4.633802816901408
383114,2,6301930908,"Not one of Frankenheimer's top dishes, this ridiculously-premised cold-war movie lacks any real insight into issues revolving around the animosity between the US and Soviet Union right before the collapse of communism. The conflict in this film hinges on a snowball being thrown by a retired US soldier...that's right, a snowball. This should've been a comedy, but the movie is so seriously philosophical in its tone throughout. The film's overall failure is that it never knows which tone to strike between an action flick with politics  in the background( I should say the action sequences in this film are about as cold and rigid as the characters), or some sort of bizarre satire commenting on snowball-gate.
If you are a fan of Frankenheimer's work as I am, stay far and away from this movie.",1455408000,2,797,4.947761194029851

383117,5,6301930908,"If the Cold War genre is up your alley, you'd be doing yourself a real disservice if you pass this movie by. It's brilliantly cast and does a great job in showing a small-scale illustration of the large-scale animosity the two sides had for each other. I was stationed in Berlin during the height of the Cold War (late eighties, early nineties) and find this to be one of the most compelling Cold War movies ever made. I've watched it at least twenty times and never tire of it. I'm giving this movie five stars only because Amazon won't let me rate it higher, and I can't recommend it highly enough.",1446940800,4,600,4.414414414414415

383120,4,6301930908,"Sure except for the fact that based on todays movies and ideas for film, and even for a few that were made back in this movies day and age, it lacks. But it made an interesting impression on me when I saw it. I found the characters were a little predictable, the story line as well. But for me, the true interest in the film came about in the reasons behind the conflict between the two generals on opposite side of the of the cold war. The plausibility of what happens is unlikely true, and there is a great deal of comedic sense with the various confrontations between these two men. But for me I found how it began, a throwing of a simple snow ball and how it ended with the same had a great deal to say on the entire theme of the times. Having grown up in this time and always with the threat of nuclear war, I found the film very entertaining and fun to watch. Especially when the two men find themselves trying to kill each other and what happens when they look over each other's shoulders in the end.",1366761600,,1007,4.1692307692307695

7817558,3,6301930908,"This is a movie about an American colonel (played by Roy Scheider) who feels left behind by past wars rattling the cage of the Russian bear across the Czech border, in tense Bavaria (West Germany), a year before the wall falls down. He repeatedly attempts to, as one character puts it, ""Turn us all into French Fries,"" by antagonizing the good-humored, just-doing his job defending Czechoslovakian territory, Soviet colonel (played by Jrgen Prochnow). To be honest, for the first half of this movie, I was left rooting for the Reds, because Roy Scheider's character was being a real jerk.  Then midway through the movie, this single mom from Czechoslovakia appears, pulls on everyone's heart strings, and things go sideways.  By the end of the film, you see everybody change from who they were at the beginning of the film.

This film is worth seeing for the final battle between the two colonels. It was the fight-scene that The Hobbit: War of the Five Armies paid h'omage to, in making Tolkien's similar anti-War message.  You also see the characters evolve (although Roy Scheider has a particularly thick-skull).  The movie has more than enough silly moments (not so much funny, just silly).  It was filmed not in Bavaria, but in Calgary, Canada; although the set and costumes used by the Germans at the ""Golden Horse Inn"" look authentic enough.  The title derives from a quote by Albert Einstein, which is given at the end of the movie if you are unfamiliar with it, and makes sense given the climax you had just witnessed.  I found it an OK movie, probably worth a watch if you may be a fan or either actor, like 80s cold war movies, or want to see Peter Jackson's inspiration for the battle in Five Armies.",1519516800,,1712,4.721476510067114
