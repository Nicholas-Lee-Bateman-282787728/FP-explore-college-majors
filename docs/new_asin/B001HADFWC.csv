3627653,5,B001HADFWC,"I have been inside the Great Pyramid.  This gave a good description about what exactly is inside the pyramid.  It is not just a pile of rocks.  So, this was a very interesting description of how the pyramid is constructed.  Interesting.",1370217600,,236,4.682926829268292
3627654,5,B001HADFWC,"This is the best documentary I have seen on the Great Pyramid, with 3d computer models, many different theories on how it was built and great camera footage of the inside and outside.
Watching this gave me the sense of actually being there and how big it is. There is a part of the program, where the host climbs way up the side and it gives you an idea of how tall it is and how dangerous it must have been to build it.  I never knew how big the blocks were that made up the pyramid....unreal ! This is a great dvd for anyone interested in the pyramids and how they were built.",1354924800,3,578,4.0701754385964914
3627655,3,B001HADFWC,"This is only 50 minutes long, and left some big questions unanswered. But it was still interesting.

Architect Jean-Pierre Houdin, working with what information he could gather and a sophisticated computer program, developed three significant elements of a theory as to how the Great Pyramid was built. Before he published his theory, the mystery of how those huge blocks of stone could be raised all the way to the top of the pyramid was pretty much complete. There were a few suggestions, but there were pretty convincing arguments against each one.

Some argued that a huge external ramp was built first, but in order to keep it at the maximum workable 7 degree slope, it would have had to have been a mile long. Not only is there absolutely no evidence of such a ramp, but the building of the ramp would have been a project as massive as the pyramid itself. That it would be built and then taken away so completely that no evidence remained is too much to swallow. Using levers and pulleys simply cannot be substantiated; problems about where the bases of the levers would sit, how these huge machines would be moved to the next position needed, and how they could work fast enough are all unexplained. And a ramp outside the pyramid would have obstructed the view of the pyramid itself, making it impossible to keep it straight and true where line-of-sight measurements needed to be taken.

Houdin's theory is that there were ramps built inside the pyramid, much like the ones visible in nearby tombs. Why have such ramps not been found? They may yet be found, but there is also the possibility that they were filled in after the structure was otherwise complete.

What was the purpose of the ""grand gallery,"" the long, narrow, sloping chamber from the level of the queen's chamber and the burial chamber of the pharaoh? Houdin's evidence is very strong that it ran a counter-weight for sledges pulling the huge granite beams above the burial chamber into position.

Finally, what do the cracks in the great granite beams above the burial chamber tell about the building, or did they happen afterward, due to an earthquake or something? Using very sophisticated computer models of the stresses involved in the building, Houdin and the team of softwear engineers that supported him studied the stresses and discovered that extreme stress appeared as the beams were being raised exactly where the cracks show even today. This apparently relieved the stress without making the entire structure fall, and in fact the cracks got no wider over time.

If architecture, Egyptology, engineering, or computer modeling interest you, this one will get to you. The evidence for the internal ramps is not conclusive, but intriguing nonetheless. The rest is pretty firmly established.",1336867200,7,2774,4.916666666666667
3627656,5,B001HADFWC,"I was thoroughly fascinated and intrigued by this latest theory about the construction of the Great Pyramid of Khufu.  I have always thought that the ancient Egyptians were a very practical and clever people who accomplished so much with the simplest of tools, devices and methods.

There are actually three theories that are proposed: (1) the massive blocks were raised to the upper levels of the pyramid using an INTERNAL ramp (how simple, how clever!); (2) the Grand Gallery served as a conduit for the raising of the massive roof beams and supports for the King's Chamber- it seems so obvious now but it took the eyes of an Architect to reverse engineer all of the evidence and come up with a plausible theory; and (3) finally, it was proven that the King's Chamber ceiling beams actually cracked slightly while the pyramid was still under construction- again careful observation, measurement and the Architect's eye make this conclusion highly plausible.

And all of what could be a very dry accounting is done with in a thoroughly absorbing and entertaining way, in no small part due to the narration of Bob Brier, one of my favorite Egyptologists on screen.

I have been fortunate enough to explore the Great Pyramid with an Egyptologist friend of mine thanks to the generosity of Dr Zahi Hawass (even when it was closed to the general public), and this documentary brought back so many vivid memories.  I think that it would be even more intriguing to those who have not actually been there: if this documentary doesn't inspire them all the more, nothing will.

I highly recommend this film to all, Egypt buff or not.  There were even two new things that I learned about the Great Pyramid but I will not give them away here.  Suffice to say that this DVD is worth purchasing because you will want to view it over and over again; I certainly did.",1292198400,13,1853,4.732919254658385

8308335,5,B001HADFWC,"Excellent book on a fascinating subject! Mainstream archaeologists cling to the ramp and ropes theory, but frankly they are insane to believe this impossible scenario! This book shows that there are alternative theories, albeit suppressed by the funded archaeologists, that allow their reader to visualise how these structures may have been built without stretching the credibility off your sanity.",1428969600,,398,5.762711864406779
8308336,5,B001HADFWC,"An excellent 50 minute documentary to show students who are studying ancient Egypt.  It combines engineering, history and geography with the story of a true hero (Jean-Pierre Houdin) in a interesting way.  Bravo National Geographic.

8308341,5,B001HADFWC,"I'm surprised that more people haven't given this product 5 stars.  Yes, it leaves questions unanswered, but I'm pretty sure that's the nature of the topic.  I would be disappointed if they pretended to know definitively what transpired thousands of years ago.

High school world history students found this film so fascinating, and it spurred such great class discussion, that several students wanted to watch it again.  I would recommend fast forwarding a couple of minutes at the beginning of the film, where they introduce their conclusions, so that kids can really experience the ""discovery"" phase of looking at the problems surrounding the theories of how the pyramids were constructed.

The pacing of the film was good.  My only complaint was that they didn't let the professionals involved really appear as brilliant as they are.  Highly recommended!",1379980800,,858,5.218978102189781
