8731769,1,B014T15OWY,"This is a pretty poorly written aimed at the kid's market film.  The cover has the words ""Their Home is in Crisis, But the Animals Come to the Rescue!"" Perhaps from that phrase you're envisioning some sort of Babe, Madagascar style animals acting like humans who can talk to each other and come up with a plan to thwart the human bad guys, that's not the type of movie this is.  The animals (and not all the ones on the cover are in the film, there's no bear for example), are just regular animals, nothing wrong with that but it's information you may want before making a purchasing decision.  The premise of the film is that the mayor and bank manager of a small town find out there is likely a huge gold mine underneath the zoo and are determined to sabotage the financially struggling zoo so they can buy it.  The thing is though, for the animals' sake, your hoping they'll be successful.  This is one of those old cement floor small metal cage type zoos that were outlawed in pretty much every developed country on the planet (perhaps not the US if this film is anything to go by).  It's very distressing to see creatures such as huge tigers lying in these cages that aren't much bigger than them.  You'd think this film studio could have made a donation to a real zoo's conservation program to film the very few scenes that have animals in them on location.  I really hope this isn't some rich into collecting exotic animals as possessions person's collection.

The film's central character is an I guess supposed to be around ten year old girl.  The actress does an all right job although her dialogue doesn't come across as that natural.  But that's the script writers, not her fault.  Speaking of the script writers, what's up with the main zoo keeper Mr Baker?  Charlie mentions an animal they are looking through the cage at is pretty, he replies with something like ""and so are you?""  Throughout the film he makes all kinds of grooming remarks to the girl like this.  At one stage the bad guys find out some information on his past that they don't reveal at the time, but will use to bring the zoo down, you're expecting it to be he's spent time in prison for crimes against children and that the film will end up having a side story/lesson as Mr Baker is led away in handcuffs about the dangers kids face and what Charlie (the girl) should have done the first time he made an inappropriate comment towards her.  Disappointingly though the film doesn't go there so you're left wondering what all Mr Baker's creepy lines were in the film for then.  Even at the end Charlie is at the zone alone and being chased by the mayor and banker and her parents rock up and don't react the way you would if you saw two grown men trying to grab your daughter.

The mayor's dim-witted nephew and his phobia of animals and seemingly not being able to differentiate them from humans such as a  Llama that likes to spit on him and not being able to grasp why his response the snake saw him, when asked if anyone did, wasn't a helpful answer do bring some brief entertainment moments to the film.  But the whole time your watching this you just can't get over the suffering of the animals in their small cement floored iron bar prison cells.

Perhaps the plot would have worked better set on a farm, or the family owned land used for a summer camp or something else rather than supporting wherever this was filmed.",1422662400,,3408,4.455716586151369
