8500724,3,B006MGWC2A,"Overall it's a pretty basic TNA show. Most of the matches don't really stand out. Good X-Division title opener, basic tag title match, a pretty interesting knockout title match with the shark cage involved (despite the lousy finish) and the World title match is pretty decent and well done.

The match that really makes this DVD worth watching is the Monster's Ball match between Abyss & Bully Ray. This match was very bloody and violent with lots of crazy stunts that blew me away. Barbed Wire, thumbtacks, cheese-graters, everything!",1405468800,,535,5.01123595505618

8500726,3,B006MGWC2A,"X Division Champion Austin Aries vs. Jesse Sorrensen vs. Kid Kash vs. Zema Ion - Aries thought he was the odd man out against the other three so he tried to play it smart from the start by rolling to the outside & letting them battle each other before his theory was proven right when everyone tried to roll up Aries for a pin when he got back in the ring.  This match had it's share of moments like a 3 man Tower Of Doom followed by Aries trying to pin everyone involved right after, Ion doing a twisting top rope dive onto Kash & Aries with Jesse doing a cannonball dive onto both right after, Kash powerbombing Ion into the bottom turnbuckle, Ion doing a 450 splash followed by Aries trying to show him up by doing one of his own, and Aries doing his brainbuster from the second rope.  This was a throwback to the X division multi-man matches they would have years ago when everyone had their moment to shine both in the ring & personality wise in a great opening match.

Devon vs. The Pope - Pope came to the ring with Devon's sons while Devon ran straight to the right & took the fight right to Pope taking it to the outside before slamming his head into the steps & apron before Pope gained some control with a dropkick that sent Devon off the top rope & focused on his head with punts into the ring post & a DDT.  Things really came to ahead when Pope invited Devon's sons into the ring & demand that they ""get him"" but decided to check up on their dad instead causing Pope to turn on & attack the kids which fired up Devon into a dominating victory.  Despite how you may personally feel in regards to the storyline, they did have a solid match that told a good story.

Rob Van Dam vs. Gunner - Around this time, Gunner had been injuring wrestlers via a DDT on the concrete floor leading up to this match after he attempted to do the same to RVD on an earlier Impact.  The match started out with RVD giving his best shots only for Gunner to take them & still hold his own before he took control with power moves & a slam on the outside mat.  RVD made a miscue going over the top rope which landed him on the exposed concrete floor which Gunner took advantage of leading to another victim of the DDT to the floor.  This was one of those matches that did it's job in building someone, Gunner in this case, but wasn't anything special or memorable past that.

Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Mickie James - Earlier in the night, Velvet Sky talked with Sting & was able to have Madison Rayne put into a cage & elevated above the ring so she wouldn't be able to interfere like he has previously done in Gail Kim's matches...but I'm warning you now that if you can't stand Madison's screaming them put the match on mute because she's shrieking throughout the entire match.  Mickie & Gail had a good match that kept building momentum & picking up the pace with Velvet at ringside cheering Mickie on but there came a point where Madison tossed something to Gail from the cage only for Mickie to catch it & use it right in front of the referee leading to the crowd chanting ""bulls...""  This match looked like it was going somewhere but turned out to not go anywhere, made the ""Madison in a cage"" stipulation completely pointless since she was still able to interfere in the match, and had Mickie come off like she didn't even care about the title anymore.  Look up their match on Impact two weeks earlier to see the match that should have been here.

Monster's Ball Match: Abyss vs. Bully Ray - For those who haven't seen a Monster's Ball match before, this is TNA's version of a hardcore weapons match. You got various moments that you would expect based off both men's history in this match from a match of dueling chairs, Abyss punching through a trash can, brawling in & out of the ring, Abyss' arm cut open, Ray headfirst into the steps, the return of ""Janice"", a cheese grader to the crotch, being put through tables, being thrown on & squeezed between the barbed wire wrapped boards, thumbtacks, and stiff kendo stick shots.  It started off slow but in the end, you got exactly what you would expect from TNA's resident hardcore monster & a heel who made his reputation for being very ""extreme"" in a hardcore environment.

Tag Team Champions Matt Morgan & Crimson vs. Magnus & Samoa Joe - Magnus & Joe were put together & won a ""Wild Card Tournament"" where teams were put together at random (think WCW's Lethal Lottery) with the winners getting a shot at the champions.  Morgan & Crimson used their high & power advantage to control the match early while Joe & Magnus relied more on wrestling & isolating Crimson from Morgan.  One interesting thing here was that they were building for Crimson to make the hot tag to Morgan with the crowd having a dueling chant of ""We Want Morgan...No We Don't!""  The tag match was average but lost a bit of momentum when they decided to cut away to backstage to continue another storyline from earlier.

James Storm vs. Kurt Angle - Storm dominated early with Angle not able to get any sort of offense in before finally able to get an advantage when Storm hesitated for a quick second grounding him with moves like a side chinlock.  Both men traded momentum & even going arial at one point with Kurt doing a moonsault & Storm doing a top rope elbow drop.  At one point attempting Storm's own superkick before Storm countered with a codebreaker & cutter but when Storm attempted his own superkick, Angle resorted to dirty tactics of his own.  This was a solid match but not as good as their previous PPV match.

TNA Champion Bobby Roode vs. Jeff Hardy - Hardy was in control early with his diverse offense before Roode was able to start working over his arm with various armbars before Hardy made a comeback with a flying clothesline to the outside but hurt himself hitting his elbow on the concrete.  Hardy continued to fight on the outside by throwing Roode into the steps followed by him using the steps to launch himself into Roode with a side dropkick but that also hurt himself as his leg hit the guardrail before Roode was able to gain control due to Hardy crotching himself when attempting a top rope move.  Roode grounded Hardy & was able to counter his attempt at a kick to the head into the crossface but he got too confident causing Hardy regained momentum.  From here, Roode realized that he was in danger of losing the championship & resorted to every single dirty trick & taking advantage of the champions advantage of ""the challenger has to beat the champion"" with Hardy kept trying to prevent Roode from screwing him over.  This just like the previous month's PPV main event where it had a bad ending but if you can get past that, it was a good competitive match.

In the end, what really hurt this PPV was the bad finishes to matches (Knockouts & World Title) while some matches were just there (RVD/Gunner) and others were average to good but nothing really as a standout performance past the Monster's Ball & X Division so this is one of those events I would pick up if you got a couple of spare bucks but not go out of your way to get.",1370476800,,7095,4.402905198776758
