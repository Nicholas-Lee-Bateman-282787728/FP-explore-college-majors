5724179,3,B00CJ7Y1U2,"Medaka is a normal high school girl, who is loved by nearly everyone, and loves nearly everyone. She's been elected class president and has dedicated herself to making school life better for her classmates, which she succeeds at spectacularly. Anyone who doesn't like her, she wins over to her side eventually.

So, she's a Mary Sue. But, she's got boobs the size of her head!

But, seriously, Medaka is practically a saint with a magnificent body, that happens to solve everybody's problems instantly. It's sorta entertaining. And it looks terrific in HD. Plus, despite what I've said about Medaka's body, it never devolved into pandering softcore porn like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freezing-Complete-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B00D39UQ2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freezing: Complete Series [Blu-ray</a>] does.

It's a bit weak, plot wise. It begins with Medaka solving classmates problems every episode, and ends with one climactic battle. It's fine. It gets more entertaining in the second series, Medaka Box Abnormal.

I really wanted to love this series, but what killed my enthusiasm was the subpar Dub job. All the characters sound too mature to be high schoolers, but the most damning, the lip sync is off. The first episode is terrible at making the lip flaps match the script. It gets better as the series goes on, but it never goes away.

If I'm paying $40-$50 for a crappy dub, I feel ripped off!

Now, if you like to watch thing with subtitles, then this doesn't affect you. But I paid a large chunk money for this, so I am not happy.

So, for a fair beginning for a Shonen series, but a crappy dub, I give Medaka Box a 3-out-of-5. You are better off watching it with subtitles, steaming on Hulu. Or if you want watch it dubbed, wait until this costs less than $30.",1383004800,8,1820,5.149152542372882

8582429,5,B00CJ7Y1U2,"This was an enjoyable anime. It has a story with action, selfishness, and heart. I enjoyed it better then the second season but both were extremely drawn and the story is flawless. It is worth having in any bodies collection",1462838400,,224,4.625

8582431,5,B00CJ7Y1U2,This was an entirely thrilling Shonen Jump series. I loved it from here to the Abnormal series and both the Action and Comedy were a perfect balance.,1441929600,,149,4.555555555555555

8582435,5,B00CJ7Y1U2,"This was a pretty good show. It's not a harem and it did have the voice actors of Clannad which was cool. It was entertaining and the ending really picked up! I just can't stand when people recommend to watch the show (or any anime) free online because it's not worth the money. That is why the anime industry can't produce shows that people want to watch :/
Anyway. Medaka box is good I recommend it.",1411344000,,401,4.2894736842105265
8582436,4,B00CJ7Y1U2,"Finally watched it. What a great ending!! 4 stars in that it could have been a bit more lively, but that's just my opinion. Since I liked this one so much, I will be getting the sequel, ""Medaka Box Abnormal"" also.",1404691200,,213,4.219512195121951
8582437,5,B00CJ7Y1U2,this tv  series for dvd is my most favorite tv show of all time awesome amazing cool wonderful and totally.,1389312000,,107,4.35
8582438,2,B00CJ7Y1U2,"What you see is what you get. I don't know why it says Spanish in the description. I love this show though. Senti films needs to work on there production design. They could have added a printed menu or something , I mean its a season 1 complete collection people- not a regular DVD volume with a measly 4 episodes. All I ask is that they add a little something extra besides a case and 3 discs",1387411200,,393,4.116883116883117
