Claudio Abbado's conducting is impeccable but in the ""Rckert songs"" Magdalena Kezema is disappointing. Her voice lacks coloring and seems thin. This limits the beautiful interpretations that these songs deserve. Also her emoting/acting doesn't quite correspond to her interpretation. I may be very critical since I am used to Janet Baker recordings with Sir John Barbirolli. I would recommend these highly unless one absolutely wants a DVD.of these songs.",1501804800,,519,5.666666666666667

8415599,4,B00442M0S0,"Abbado has the enviable reputation of being one of the world's finest Mahler conductors. This has been further reinforced by his set of performances held at Lucerne with his hand-picked orchestra constituting the Lucerne Festival orchestra.

This very large orchestra, apart from containing musicians of outstanding individual abilities, also lays great stress upon their empathy and experience with the world of chamber music. Thus is achieved the unusual combination of orchestral size allied to individual and corporate sensitivity. This suits Abbado's particular vision of Mahler and is apparent throughout this fine performance.

A word of caution though: The recording of this performance visually is up to the usual standard, but the surround sound has been the subject of much heated debate - largely because it isn't there. There was a technical breakdown concerning the recording of the surround sound of this issue. It was decided to fake the surround sound from the stereo master. It might have been a better decision to have issued the disc as just stereo - but the problem for Euroarts was that Blu-ray customers expect and demand surround sound. The result has been confusion at best and anger at worst. I personally prefer this issue to the earlier DVD with the Mahler Youth Orchestra on DVD and real surround sound simply because I prefer the 'fill-up' or coupling being offered. The interpretation of the symphony is very similar.

The upcoming series planned by Chailly, also on Blu-ray, might become a serious competitor to Abbado however. It certainly might resolve the issue of which Mahler 4 to buy. Chailly's Mahler 2 and 8 are now available. Some find Chailly preferable as an approach - being a degree less overtly emotional and more orchestrally cohesive rather than sharing Abbado's expanded chamber music approach perhaps. I personally find both approaches equally satisfying in their different ways (see my Chailly review of Mahler 2 for further details).

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

Sadly, I cannot comment on the sound which seems to be the focus of attention of most reviews.
However, we are supposed to be talking about Claudio Abbado's Mahler ! Nobody can deny that Abbado is a superb conductor and a superb Mahler conductor. The Berlin Philharmonic do not engage Bonzos. And the Lucerne Festival Orchestra is a superb orchestra, with several familiar Berlin faces in it. They play with great style, passion and enthusiasm. The whole enterprise is absolutely perfect. Yet I am often left strangely unmoved. It is all very clinical and surgical. I realise that many people had the same view of Abbado's predecessor, Herbert von Karajan but not me. Haitink is often regarded as cool, analytical and unemotional but I find Haitink's Mahler deeply moving. Letting Mahler speak for himself seems to work well for Mahler. So there we are: horses for courses ! (U.K. review)

8415600,5,B00442M0S0,"I have not always been a fan of Abbado's recent Mahler, finding it beautifully played but lacking the requisite angst.  That is not a problem here.  The 4th is Mahler's most joyful symphony, and the partnership between composer and partner is ideal.  The transparent and virtuoso sound of the players here perfectly serves the music rather than glides over it.  Abbado seems to have this music flowing out of his beatific smile, and we're all the better for it.

The singer, Magdalena Kozena (who I recently heard live in the Ruckert lieder-- the opening item on this DVD), does not always achieve the same level of technical mastery (she is no Janet Baker) as does the orchestra, and I can sympathize with those who feels she emotes visually just a little too much, but there's no denying the commitment and the beauty of much on display.  The simple fact is, this is the only available DVD of the Ruckert Lieder (one of the highest crests in the sea of German song), and it is more than worthy.  Indeed, in some moments it is otherworldly, just as it must be.",1337126400,2,1061,4.582010582010582
8415601,2,B00442M0S0,"Great concert and very good sound... in stereo.

For the multichannel, it's a stereo remix in 5 channels. It's a pity because the record session have been made in 2009 ! The 1st symphony record (summer 2009 too) is perfect so why this one is a remix ?
Please EuroArts, improve it as you did for the second one.",1303171200,3,310,4.254237288135593
8415602,1,B00442M0S0,"First, the good news. The disc does not freeeze on vocal tracks. Now, the bad news ........

I have to agree with Godbluffer's assessment of this disc. If I had watched this on TV I would have rated it as excellent in all respects. It is only when you listen through well set-up surround speakers that the deficiencies really present themselves. Try starting the Euroarts Blueray disc of Mahler 3 in stereo mode and then go to Audio Setup and change to DTS 5.1. A completely new, engaging and  almost holographic, but natural soundworld suddenly appears from the speakers. The sound of the audience before the start of the concert envelopes you, and the sound of the music grips you from the start, Do the same with this disc and the sound stays essentially the same. I'm not even sure if the front centre speaker is doing anything at all, and hardly any sound comes out of the rear speakers. It is clearly NOT true surround sound, though the information viewable on screen states that it is DTS MA 5.1. The engineers don't even appeared to have tried to make it sound like ANY type of surround sound, This is STEREO, regardless of what it says on the disc.

Why can Euroarts apparently no longer provide a true 5.1 sound track when EVERY standard new DVD or Bluray you buy these days can? There was a time, not so long ago, when you bought a Euroarts DVD knowing that you were almost certainly getting state of the art picture AND sound quality. Those days seem to be gone. The people who are now producing Euroarts DVDs and Bluerays are going to put them out of business if they don't take an immediate grip on the quality of their current issues.

I won't be buying future Euroarts discs, including the eagerly anticipated Abbado Mahler 9, until I see some reviews assuring me that I am not being fobbed-off with unsatisfactory - and fake - sound. What a pity it is that the superb efforts of Abbado and his musicians are being let down by, what I can only assume, are cost-cutting measures.",1293580800,15,1994,4.515235457063712
8415603,2,B00442M0S0,"At the same day I received an email from Euroarts that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/blu-ray-of-Mahler-2/dp/B003X859FC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">blu-ray of Mahler 2</a>&nbsp;will finally see an improved release in the first half of January 2011, I'm a bit sad to report that the brand new blu-ray of Mahler 4 also isn't quite what it should have been.  Again it sounds like the technicians have been using a stereo source to create the surround track for this one.  The positive is that this time the quality of that source is actually good; it sounds refined and there are no squashed dynamics, so buyers who only have a stereo set-up and are not planning to upgrade to a surround set-up should be pretty pleased with the result here.
People with surround set-ups and with discerning ears will be frustrated though, as the ""surround"" effect here really doesn't entail more than some very modest action in the rear speakers, and just a little less modest action in the center speaker, but it's very obvious that it's nothing more than a mix-down from a stereo source; there are none of the dedicated, yet natural sounding, center speaker effects that can be heard on the BD's of Mahler 1, 3 and 6.  With the Mahler 2 I could understand that in 2003 there wasn't yet as much dedication to HD, making it at least understandable that there wasn't a satifying 5.1 mix for the HD edit of that concert, but the Mahler 4 was recorded in 2009, so how is it possible that something similar happened again here?  I will again be contacting Euroarts about this and I hope it's deemed bad enough for another replacement to issued in the near future, just like with the Mahler 2.  I will be keeping you posted for any updates!",1293062400,12,1763,4.922558922558922
8415604,5,B00442M0S0,"This performance was recorded in the Lucerne Concert Hall in August, 2009.  Conductor Claudio Abbado and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra are joined by soloist, mezzo-soprano Maglalena Kozena.  Born in the Czech Republic in 1973, Kozena is best known for her performances of Bach arias, and more recently those of Vivaldi.  Here, she sings masterfully and passionately the fourth movement of Mahler's fourth symphony and the five Ruckert-Lieder.

In these recorded performances, one often hears complaints of too many close-up shots.  But here the close-ups are justified for several reasons:

First, they show very clearly the love and respect between maestro Abbado and his musicians.  You can see the musicians' enjoying each other's playing, and carefully watching every Abbado direction.

Between movements, many have come to notice on Abbado's face, that cute little shy smile that Abbado fans have come to know.  The close-ups also help viewers take note of the significant moments where musicians hold their instruments high, to make their voices be better heard.  This action of Abbado is something Gustav Mahler frequently did with his own orchestras.

The Lucerne Festival Orchestra certainly lives up to my high expectations, based on all their earlier work with Abbado.  They are well-rehearsed.  Their timing and sound seem so perfect that it's hard to imagine that any performance could improve upon this one of Mahler's 4th.  Kozena's singing of the fourth movement looks as if she is SEEING what Mahler's words point out:  a child's vision of heaven, with all sorts of good things to eat, helpful, loving people everywhere, and beautiful music for everyone.

I have to admit that I did get a major surprise from this performance.  I've long been a devotee of Mahler's symphonies, but have generally not looked closely at his songs.  What an egregious oversight!  Magdalena Kozena's performance here of the Ruckert-Lieder has pointed out to me how short-sighted I have been.  Each of the songs is sung not only perfectly phrased and timed, with a lovely voice, but also with a passion that shows her desire to share Mahler's emotions with her audience.  In the final song, ""I have withdrawn from the world"" (Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen)--where Mahler tells us that he lives on in his songs--it may be hard for many of us to watch and hear this song without our eyes tearing up--it's so tenderly moving.  This was a masterful and touching performance!",1291593600,17,2471,5.109725685785536
