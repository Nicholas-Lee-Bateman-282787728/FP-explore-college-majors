8590335,5,B00D7AM4OA,"This is a great series for young children. Stella, the big sister, is always coming up with new and creative ways to make every day life adventurous for her little brother Sam. Her imagination is endless. This is a very calm show without all the loud annoying sounds of most. BTW...this is my 3yr old's favorite show of all time. He really loves it and it is his reward after he finishes his ""school work"". ;) This DVD shipped fast and actually has 6 episodes on it, making it well worth the money spent.",1422921600,,504,4.372340425531915
8590336,5,B00D7AM4OA,"This DVD is awesome! I really love Stella and Sam! My favorite episode to this DVD is ""Trip to the Moon"" I imagine how great that Stella, Sam and Owen goes to the moon and pretends to be on the moon in a backyard meadow. It is great for Kids and Adults to enjoy a great Childhood fun out in the open space. I would recommend it!",1421193600,,328,3.91044776119403

8590338,1,B00D7AM4OA,"I ordered this, the description said it was in new condition, and its clearly been used as the disc is cracked and does not work. Very disappointed as I ordered this for a flight I am taking with my 3 year old and there is no downloadable content of this show out there yet, so I had to order a DVD.",1390348800,3,299,3.918032786885246
