2773228,2,B000NOIX7U,Same as above. I bought these for a friend. I did watch many of these shows when their first aired but it was the same old same old every week like every other western of the 1950s and 1960s that dominated evening television with so many similar shows and spin offs.  This was just one series of dozens of westerns at the time.  But was one of the better with some over dramatic characterizations going on each episode.,1466553600,,419,4.358974358974359

2773254,4,B000NOIX7U,"I'm not sure why this and subsequent seasons of Rawhide were all brought out in two volumes; other series of the era (when a season was 39 episodes) have come out in one, and the only other Western I'm aware of that doesn't is Gunsmoke.  Therefore I'm going to make this review serve for both of them.  Hard-headed (and sometimes hard-nosed) trail boss Gil Favor (Eric Fleming) is once more (or perhaps a better word would be still) on the trail to Sedalia with his sometimes fractious crew: soft-spoken, quick-tempered ramrod Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood); easygoing, keen-eyed trail scout Pete Nolan (Sheb Woolley); irascible cook Wishbone (Pail Brinegar) and his louse, the gentle, willing, but rather dim-witted Mushy (James Murdock); wiry chain-smoking Jim Quince (Steve Raines) and his big partner Joe Scarlett (Rocky Shahan); and (as a semi-regular) the young Mexican wrangler, Hey Soos (Jesus) Patinas (Robert Cabal), who says horses talk to him.  Favor himself is tough and not always sympathetic, but he has real presence, and not only from his six feet four of height.

As they make their way northward (most specific references to place have them in Texas), the men encounter a cattle-dipping facility run by a larcenousand deadlyband of men; a former prizefighter prone to flashbacks; a jealous buffalo hunter and his attractive young wife; a bounty hunter in search of a young woman who was kidnapped by Indians years ago; a Mexican officer hunting a revolutionary whose son is working with the herd; an archaeologist looking for Druidic relics; an itinerant painter who turns out to be the key to an outlaw gang's attempt to rescue their jailed leader; Wishbone's twin brother, who is something of a man of mystery; a vicious old enemy of Favor's; a prosperous rancher who may be a large-scale horse thief on the side; a woman who claims her husband isn't her husband; a town convinced that Hey Soos's mother is a witch; the infamous Murder Steer (which really existed); a Swiss gunsmith/clockmaker/music-box maker with a hidden agenda; a young man from Boston and his rather petulant bride; and an exiled English nobleman.  Wishbone, fed up with the demands of trail-cooking and the misery in his back, decides to quit the drive and finds himself attracted to a widow; he and Rowdy are press-ganged into serving on a jury when they go in search of a dentist to pull the cook's aching tooth; Favor wounds a mountain lion which then kills a widow's young son, forcing him, for the sake of his own honor, to track down the animal and finish the job; he's exposed to smallpox, and he and Rowdy go in search of a doctor who can vaccinate him; and Rowdy is cunningly maneuvered into trying to break a wild horse that has already killed several men attempting the same thing.

Although the first season was reasonably consistent as to date, this one begins the jumping around typical of Westerns of its era: in one episode we see a grave marker dated 1870; in another Juarez is apparently in power in Mexico (which would make the date 1867-72); and in a third Diaz is President there and probably has been for 10-12 years (circa 1884-92).  As in the first season, we continue to learn something of the drovers' pasts: that Favor, as a green kid, worked for the K-Bar and was nearly killed by his own foreman after he taxed the latter with gut-shooting a friend of his; that Wishbone has a fraternal twin brother (which of them is older remains a mystery, since each calls the other little brother).  In Incident of the Tinker's Dam Mushy has a good bit in which, though tied up in bandages and slings, he impulsively takes a rifle and rides in hot pursuit of an Indian who has kidnapped Wishboneand manages to kill him too.  (As he says later on, Mister Wishbone is kinda special to me.).  And in Incident of the Sharpshooter, when Rowdy is jailed for murder, Favor doesn't hesitate to hold the herd up for as long as it takes to see he gets off.

Guest stars include Viveca Lindfors (as a handsome and haughty Spanish lady), Alexander Scourby, Beverly Garland, Douglas Kennedy, Victor McLaglen (in a segment directed by son Andrew V.), Elena Verdugo, Jacques Aubuchon, Ann Francis, Robert Lowery, Frank DeKova (atypically as a Mexican), Edward Platt, Paul Fix, John Drew Barrymore (almost unrecognizable with hair and skin darkened for an Indian part), Kent Smith, Vera Miles, Leif Erickson, Gene Evans, Cesar Romero, Mari Blanchard, Rick Jason, Fay Spain, James Dunn, Robert F. Simon, Claude Akins, Luana Patten, Arthur Franz, Neville Brand (as a surprisingly well-spoken outlaw), Regis Toomey, George Wallace, Margaret Phillips, Arthur Shields, Jock Mahoney, Richard Hughes, John Dehner, Patricia Barry, Buddy Ebsen, Dorothy Green, James Franciscus, Peter Whitney (who appears twice), Debra Paget, John Ireland, and Robert Coote.  At least one script is from a story by Clair Huffaker, and another was written by a pairof Gielguds, who may well have been related to Sir John, since the episode features an exiled Englishman.",1422921600,,5035,4.903642773207991

Nothing fakey about this series. It took me six months to watch the 1st season, as time allows. Since I have no cable nor satellite, or local TV, I just watch dvd's. I do have a dvd player. And I watch what I want, when I want. I just started The Second Season, Vol 1. The only disappointment here is that the Second Season has no production notes like the 1st. I loved those.

2773305,5,B000NOIX7U,"CBS Television and Paramount Pictures presents ""RAWHIDE: SECOND SEASON VOL. ONE"" (18 September 1959 - 29 January 1960) (720 mins/In Glorious Black & White) (digitally remastered in Dolby) -- Rawhide was a television western series that aired on the U.S. network CBS from 1959 to 1966. The show starred Eric Fleming and launched the career of Clint Eastwood --- The series ran for eight seasons on the CBS network on Friday nights, from January 9, 1959 to January 4, 1966, with a total of 217 episodes, all filmed and broadcast in black and white --- It was produced and sometimes directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also produced early episodes of Gunsmoke --- Warren based Rawhide on the movie Cattle Empire that he directed in 1958 and for which Endre Bohem was a screenwriter and Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan were actors; all also worked in Rawhide --- Its premiere episode reached the top 20 in the Nielsen Ratings. It rose steadily in popularity until, towards the end of the series run, it was one of America's top ten shows --- Rawhide was the fourth longest-running American TV western, beaten only by nine years of The Virginian and Wagon Train, fourteen years of Bonanza, and twenty years of Gunsmoke.

The episode would be introduced, usually by some words from Gil Favor but sometimes by others --- The typical Rawhide story involved drovers, portrayed by Eric Fleming (Trail Boss Gil Favor) and Clint Eastwood (ramrod Rowdy Yates), coming upon people on the trail and getting drawn into solving whatever problem they presented or were confronting --- Some of the stories were obviously easier in production terms but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its situations could range from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and so forth --- A problem on such drives was the constant need for water, and the scout spent much of his time looking for it, sometimes finding water holes, even rivers had dried up - In some ways it was similar to the TV series Wagon Train that debuted in 1957.

Of all the western characters on TV, these were the only real cowboys, because they drove cows. There were also sheep boys who drove sheep, pig boys who looked after pigs, etc. The name cowboys became a generic name in western films and TV series --- The theme song's lyrics were written by Ned Washington in 1958. It was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin and sung by pop singer Frankie Laine. The theme song became very popular --- It was covered several times and parts of the song also appear in more recent movies like The Blues Brothers and Shrek.-- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

2773316,4,B000NOIX7U,"Rawhide was one of the best westerns that was ever on television. It's a shame that CBS/Paramount has decided to break this season up in two volumes. They didn't do it on Mission: Impossible. But there's just no telling about Paramount. I don't think they are particularly geared toward customer satisfaction.

This set of Rawhide has sixteen episodes & they're in excellent condition. Though Clint Eastwood (Rowdy Yates) receives second billing, Sheb Wooley (Pete Nolan) is just as visible. Paul Brinegar (Wishbone) appears to have more screen time but James Murdock (Mushy) is still tagging along but not with much to do. We occasionally see Rocky Shahan (Joe Scarlet) but he doesn't say much. Robert Cabal (Jesus or as the credits put it, Hey-Soos) makes a single appearance.

The set opens with "" Incident of the Day of the Dead"" which has Rowdy as the primary character. It's a peculiar episode of Rawhide that has Rowdy at a ranch to attempt to break a wild stallion that no one else has been able to. It's eerie music will give you a sci-fi flashback. ""Incident of the Roman Candles"" was a bonus episode of the first season. The episode features Pete Nolan as the main character. ""Incident of the Shambling Man"" has Victor McLaglen & Anne Francis as guest stars. Mclaglen is a former boxer that has delusions of being in the ring again. Most consider him harmless but his daughter-in-law (Francis) sets him up as dangerous & lies about him attacking her. ""Incident of the Thirteenth Man"" has Wishbone with a toothache. Wishbone & Rowdy go to the nearest town & get forced into jury duty. ""Incident of the Stalking Death"" has Cesar Romero as a guest star. In this episode Favor has wounded a cougar but it has escaped. A visit from a senora leads Favor into taking more interest in finishing off the cougar. Romero sees Favor as competition for the senora so he plans to kill him. ""Incident of the Blue Fire"" is an episode I actually remember. The St. Elmo's fire bit on the cattle has always stuck with me. Skip Homeier (Lucky) is the guest star. This is the only episode Jesus appears in; it's also the only episode Charles Marquis Warren directs in this set. This episode has a mild Twilight Zone-like twist. In ""Incident at Spanish Rock"" the drovers encounter a band of Mexican revolutionaries. ""Incident of the Druid's Curse: is another strange episode of Rawhide. ""Incident at Red River Station"" involves a smallpox incident. The twist in this episode is the doctor expressing that everyone should be vaccinated. Nowadays we know about this but it was a novel idea in that period.

Overall this is a very good set of Rawhide episodes. But it's odd, after all these years, to see a young Clint Eastwood who's character isn't the star & learning about the cattle business. There are absolutely no bonus materials included in this set, not even subtitles. CBS/Paramount has really skimped on this set though they didn't really have much bonus material in the season one set.

2773318,5,B000NOIX7U,"Rawhide is one of the greatest tv shows of all time. Paramount has decided to split the seasons, which of course gets Paramount more money.

The cheaper packaging and volume 1 only release makes me think the first did not sell very well and Paramount was not willing to throw more money at the franchise if it did not show continuing interest.  So if you are a western fan or Clint Eastwood fan, go out and buy this to show the studio that there is a market and they will continue to release the future installments of Clint and the Gang.",1190764800,,514,4.171717171717172

The acting is incredible by Eric Fleming and the whole crew. The stories are presented in black and white, but it doesn't matter because the quality of the stories are classics. These stories take me back to when television was a pleasure to watch and quality stories were shown. Louie Lamour would be proud of these writers who wrote these stories. What is so amazing about Rawhide is that it draws you in to feeling that you are really there with the drovers and are caught up in the stories. In my opinion the Rawhide series was the greatest western series ever produced for television, when television was worth watching. If you can't buy the DVD series then rent it if you can.

2773321,5,B000NOIX7U,"I've made a bold statement.

Why is this the best series ever?

Well, mostly the writing. The stories are much more intriguing and surprising than any other Western series available on dvd. Sure, I like Gunsmoke, I like Daniel Boone... but these have stories that are much more simple, or ""Little House""-ish; that is, 1/3 the way through, you know what's going to happen. Personally I get bored with this type of story.

With Rawhide, you never quite know where they're going with a story, and that makes for good tv viewing!

Also, there's the acting: Clint Eastwood in one of his early roles, is great. But also Eric Fleming as Mr. Favor is great, and Sheb Wooley as Pete, and then there is one of my personal favorites, Paul Brinegar as Wishbone, who always brings a laugh or two to the series with his ""old goat"" personality and his almost-inedible food.

But to my mind, the acting - while indeed very good - is secondary to the writing, which is exceptional, making each story different and compelling.

I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out! I wonder if it continues its brilliance all the way through?",1190073600,7,1124,4.567164179104478
2773322,5,B000NOIX7U,"What a joy to have one of TV's great westerns beautifully restored and available on DVD!  Package ""Rawhide"" with other recent releases of ""Gunsmoke,"" ""Have Gun, Will Travel,"" ""Wanted: Dead or Alive,"" and ""Rifleman,"" and you can have one truly memorable evening of frontier enjoyment.  Clint Eastwood as the youthful ""Rowdy Yates"" gets most of the press on this release (including a large picture on the cover art), but Eric Fleming as trail boss ""Gil Favor"" was the glue that held this show together -- the moral compass, as it were.  As a kid in the 60's, I always wanted to be ""Favor"" when all the neighborhood youngsters played cowboy.  Veteran character actors Sheb Wooley and Paul Brinegar add more grit (and humor) to an unbeatable crew.  Now if the major studios would release ""Wagon Train"" (w/ crusty Ward Bond), ""Bonanza,"" ""Maverick,"" ""Lawman,"" and ""Cheyenne"" on DVD, I would have thought that I'd died and gone to cowboy heaven!",1188345600,8,938,4.8742138364779874
2773323,5,B000NOIX7U,"Rawhide was a big hit here in the U.K. in the early 1960s and I'm old enough to just about remember it! Some old TV series can be a disappointment when you view them many years later - they somehow don't look so good as your memory suggested! But ""Rawhide"" is an exception. Channel 4 (a major British TV channel) to their credit, re-ran many of the episodes a while back - and watching it impressed me enough to buy the DVDs.

""Rawhide"" stands apart from so many 1960s Westerns, in which the heroes look so impeccably turned out, with never a speck of dust and dirt on them. Instead ""Rawhide"" portrays grubby, smelly, tatty drovers, who bleed when they get thumped or shot, and bicker amongst themselves; the series features historically-credible and authentic detail with consistently credible storylines. For instance, our heroes aren't referred to as ""cowboys"", but ""drovers"" - a minor point but hey, that's authenticity for you. The black-and-white photography seems to enhance the atmosphere and the acting's pretty top-notch from the ensemble cast too.

Incidentally. I've seen some of the episodes from Seasons 4,5 and 6 on home-recorded VHS recently and it seems to me the very high standards of production, writing and acting were kept up throughout the series' run (I think the very last season was never broadcast in the UK so I can't comment on that one). All I'm saying is that Rawhide seems to have never ""jumped the shark"".

This is classic quality TV. Roll on the rest of the series please.",1186099200,10,1506,4.7846153846153845

Some of us are just hoping to be around to get all of them and escape to a happier time when the good guy wins, the bad guy gets what he deserves and we don't have to look at or listen to ""drama"" that our mother's would have thrown the TV in the yard if it had come over the air in the 60s.

I'm not crazy about releasing of the second season in two volumes, but that didn't stop me from buying it. However, having already purchased the first season, it makes me very angry to find that Paramount has included a rerun from the first season in this collection. I have already paid for this content.

Other reviewers list the episodes in this collection as follows:

24- Incident of the Day of the Dead 9/18/1959

39- Incident at Tinker's Dam 2/5/1960

This list is not correct. The collection provided includes a rerun of ""Incident of the Roman Candles,"" the last episode of Season One. The DVD even lists the episode as having originally aired on 9/25/1959. The real episode list is as follows:

24- Incident of the Day of the Dead 9/18/1959

I see that they are going the way of other TV shows on DVD and splitting the seasons in 2. I think it's a cheesy scheme for them to get more money from the fan base. I'm sure most of the actors from this show have passed away by now or I'm sure their original contracts could not foresee the advent of DVD technology back in the early 60's so I'm sure royalties probably aren't a big factor in the cost to the consumer. Just pure profit to those producing these DVDs for pennies.

What a great show it was.  I bought the entire first season set.  I've still got a few more to watch before I'll be wanting to see season two.  Every night instead of watching the garbage on TV nowadays, I put on my ""Rawhide"" DVD and watch.

The stories are well-written and often riveting.  Very good adventure tales of the old west.

Yes, I too was disappointed by the Season Two split up.  I also collect ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" which splits seasons up to, as they say, ""keep costs down.""  However you're actually paying MORE when you buy both volumes coming to $29 a piece, that's about $60 bucks for one season.  It's a bad marketing gimmick.

In any event, I am a hooked fan so I will likely pay the price for ""Rawhide"" because it was a very good show and is definately worth the investment for its entertainment value.",1179792000,6,1020,4.338624338624339

To pay a little more to be able to see all episodes of the best western ever made is juuuust fine by me. There's episodes on these DVD's that just weren't available on the previously released VHS tapes & as a result, there are episodes I've never seen.

I just loved season one and would buy each and every season (even if they divide each year into two releases).  These episodes are THAT good!  I hope Paramount reads these reviews so they realize there really is a big market out there with Rawhide fans just waiting to plunk down their money for these episodes.

2773351,5,B000NOIX7U,"Thoughts from various sources
-This is the landscape of Rawhide - desert, forest, mountain and plains. It is intense heat, bitter cold, torrential rain, blinding dust; men risking their lives, earning small reward - a life of challenge - Rawhide.  It is men like trail scout Pete Nolan, the cantankerous Wishbone, Ramrod Rowdy Yates, good natured Mushy, and trail boss Gil Favor - these men are Rawhide!
-The time was the 1860s - Gil Favor and Rowdy Yates moved cattle across the country, with episodes depicting the struggles and hardships they faced on their cattle drive from San Antonio, Texas, to Sedalia, Kansas.
-The proliferation of TV channels, video and other home entertainment formats has ensured that the best of the past will continue to find an audience. The appeal of nostalgia in those who recall its first airing has never been better served. ""Rawhide"" was about the west, the cowboy and his backbreaking work on the trail. Filmed outdoors, it told absorbing stories, and included unforgettable Gil Favor, Rowdy Yates and Wishbone the cook. It launched the career of Clint Eastwood. It offered a glimpse of the best qualities of its other leading actor Eric Fleming and now begs the question of what he might have achieved had he lived. When the prevailing opinion of current television is so negative and dismissive, ""Rawhide"" is an example of what the medium could once achieve. The critical acclaim it received during its mid-nineties run on the UK's Channel 4 seems like proof of that.
 -These were stories about the Old West you may have read about as a kid.  Rawhide requires a high degree of attention to plot and character. You don't see presentations of morality issues like these any more.  Rawhide reminds us of just what a great storytelling medium television can be.
-The 'heart' of the show - the pivotal character - was Gil Favor (Eric Fleming). Whether the character was in a given show for two seconds or the entire episode, Eric Fleming was counted on to ground the show and give it the successful flavor it Gil Favor was the essence and backbone of Rawhide.
-I dearly love Eric Fleming and I never hear Clint Eastwood talk about Eric Fleming or say anything nice about him-Eric had a sad childhood and he was a sculptor and a painter. It's true Rawhide was never the same when he got fired If they hadn't fired him (final season) he might still be alive. Even though Eric Fleming is dead I wish in some way they could create a tribute to him. He was a very gifted actor.
-Originally titled ""Cattle Drive"" but later changed to ""Rawhide"".  Rawhide was a concentration on the harsh aspect of frontier life.  This would be a series to depict the ""working west"" and the men and women who inhabited it.  Gil was the trail boss, the supervisor of the entire cattle-drive operation. Rowdy was his right-hand man Other regulars were the cooks, drovers, and scouts who helped the cattle drive stay together.
-The show was sometimes brutal. Its situations could be apocalyptic - parched plains, anthrax, gypsy curses, ghostly riders, wolves.
-The early death of Eric Fleming is the only reason he didn't grow to be a star that would dwarf Clint Eastwood today.
-Charles Marquis Warren would have preferred ninety minutes per episode if allowed.
It's been an unforgivable crime that this series has been withheld from us for all these years. Occasionally referred to as the `lost classic', hopes are high that this classic no longer be a lost one. Thank you Paramount!  Please continue with the series!
Hearing Eric's voice is something special. Eric can do it all and probably better than anyone has or ever will.  I don't think anyone will ever be able to convey what Eric was able to achieve in this series.
Rowdy is excellent, endearing and simply oozes masculinity!  We need to go back to the 1950s and 1960s when it was okay to show men acting like real men!
Hard feelings develop as they do in real life and the confrontations in this series are riveting. The focus of the series is human feeling, often powerful feelings -not special effects, like too many shows nowadays. It seems as though special effects, too often, are the stars today.
The DVDs are uncut and digitally remastered and after comparing them to my old copies from television the difference is night and day. We sure are lucky to have this great series available with such a razor sharp picture! The close ups have such clarity it's amazing.  This kind of clarity was never available to us in the past, but it's possible now.  I can't wait to view it on the new big screen TVs they're making nowadays.  The continuation of the classic Rawhide is a landmark event for fans of the western!",1174176000,31,4687,4.736196319018405
2773352,5,B000NOIX7U,"I believe someone else has already commented on this, but it bears repeating:  Even for a half season, this is a better price than Columbia House ever was - either for the Columbia House DVDs of Rawhide or their VHS tapes.

And if ever there were a TV series that is well worth the money, this is it.  A better western than Rawhide was never made.  None of the other TV westerns of its era came this close to realism.  That's a big reason why this western stands up to the test of time so much better than the others.  These guys really looked like dusty, weary trailhands pushing a herd past any and all obstacles that turned up on their long, gritty trip to the railhead.  I understand this series repeatedly won Western Heritage Awards during its original run, and deservedly so.

Also, none of the other westerns had the incomparable Eric Fleming lending his presence as the tough, relentlessly independent, intelligent, but not infallible boss of the drive. Of course, for the many Eastwood fans, there is also the chance to see a young Clint in the show that first made him famous.

We Rawhide fans have been waiting sooooooo long for our favorite series to become available uncut and in mint condition on DVD, and this is most likely our last chance to own remastered, complete Rawhide episodes. So no gambling on a boycott for me.

Powers-That-Be, if you're listening:  MORE, MORE, MORE!!  Please keep releasing more Rawhide episodes!  I would gladly shell out the money here and now to buy all 8 seasons if only they were available.",1174003200,48,1541,4.6213235294117645
2773353,5,B000NOIX7U,"This series was about working trail drovers. It had a memorable theme song, Rowdy sings ""Beyond the Sun"" in an early episode.  ""Wishbone"" was a beloved and it was great to se Sheb Wooley ""Pete"" as a taciturn cowboy.
This is the best western series I've ever seen. I've been waiting since the 80's for this. We sure are spoiled now to get it all on DVD when up until recently all we had was television re-runs. This release is a landmark event, meaning Paramount knows the western market is for real and let's hope the next installment of episodes is soon on the way! Its only been ten months since the last batch from Season 1 was released (July 2006 to May 2007), so there's an excellent chance for more episodes to be released.
I'm so happy with season 1 that I can't wait to dig into these new episodes. After watching cut episodes on TV for years this is great news.  This is the only source for uncut versions. Last place Columbia House only come out with 3 episodes a disk, this is great to get a load of 16 all at once now with Paramount.
The black and white sure is glorious and beautifully shot. If you're new to the series you'll get used to the black and white very quickly will soon like it. This is like a time machine that takes you back to a very special time.  The music in the series is so well integrated with the show it's unbelievable and is wonderful. Gil and Rowdy's hats are of almost legendary status and immediately identify the show.
So many details of the old west in this series, it's really great. It's true that Gil and Rowdy rule and Rawhide is #1!

Clint is fantastic. Rowdy sings in ""Incident of the Hostages"", ""The Pitchwagon"", and several other episodes.  Clint is fantastic!

Eric/Gil is so much a man that he reminds us all of the bygone he-man era! Great role model. I can't wait to see Eric in these episodes. Both Clint and Eric were outdoorsmen their whole lives, and it shows.

Eric lived outdoors much of his life, so stands that he looks and feels so comfortable in the outdoor settings.

Guest stars are the finest I've ever seen.  (James Coburn is excellent in `Incident of the Hostage Child"" coming up in later seasons)

I've been waiting for years for the continuation of the series. This boxed set release is the farthest anyone had marched forward with in the series and in fact these episodes have never before been viewed by the general public in their uncut versions! Our dream of perfectly remastered, uncut episodes is finally starting to come true!

This is a tremendous series. The per episode cost is almost exactly the same as the Season 1 boxed set. ($1.87 per episode vs. $1.67 per episode for season 1)so it's very affordable. The half season format is great as it keeps the overall cost low so as to be affordable for all. After waiting 40+ years for this series, (40 painful agonizing years),  I can only call this a dream come true from Paramount! After the cruel betrayal of Columbia House this release is a critical step in the continuation of the series (CH started making DVDs in 2003 and then stopped in 2004 but they did a poor job of marketing, now in the capable hands of Paramount we are finally making real progress.) ( CH had made episodes available through early episodes in season 2, at the price of approximately $28 per 3 or 4 episodes)! (Columbia House had so cruelly betrayed us in 2004 when they stopped making DVDs and only got as far as a few episodes into Season 2 at seven times the price!)

  Thank you, Paramount for continuing with the series farther than anyone else and making dreams come true! Please continue with the remaining episodes! And thank you also for making this series so low cost!

I eagerly await viewing uncut,  perfectly remastered episodes. Sure will look great on a big screen and I can't wait for more! I sure am getting tired of the series they make nowadays, all flash and color and little substance and attention to detail. The series is focused on human feelings instead of special affects which makes it far superior to so many shows they make nowadays. They have really forgotten how to tell a good story nowadays. That's why we need Rawhide in our viewing all the more.",1173657600,29,2929,4.627413127413128
2773370,5,B000NOIX7U,"Ok--I appear to be the only one with this opinion, but here it is:  Of course, I am tremendously disappointed that the release will be only 1/2 a season, but...it's Rawhide...my all-time favorite Western. I have been waiting years for it to come out and I'm am definitely going to buy it.  I would agree that this is most likely a marketing ploy to get more money out a season release, but as one commentor pointed out, 16 episodes at $29.99 comes out to $1.67 per episide, a bargain as I see it.  I also wonder if the number of episodes in a typical Rawhide season, 31, has something to do with it being packaged in two parts. Season 1, which came out complete, was only 23.  So, I will happily plunk down my money and enjoy watching a first-quality Western.  There are several good episodes in the first 16 of Season 2 that I will be delighted to see uncut and uninterrupted.",1173571200,45,877,4.355828220858895

I concur with the other reviewers of this 2nd season set. This is one of my all time favorite TV series, but I won't stand for highway robbery and will wait until Paramount realizes that treating the consumer fairly is as important, if not more so, than making a ""quick"" buck! Either put the series out unedited in the complete 2nd season format or forget it! You won't see any of my money for half a season sets!",1173312000,10,535,4.306930693069307

Notice to studio nitwits who pay attention to comments on Amazon: When you decide to market this set and future Rawhide series as single sets for each season AND at a reasonable price, as you did with the first season, I'll be happy to purchase them.

Until then, I'm saving money!!",1173139200,17,487,4.34065934065934

8179894,4,B000NOIX7U,"I wasn't sure I was ready to spend 12 bucks on half a season (and with no extras) but I did with little if no regret.  Like season one - of RAWHIDE - Season 2 Volume 1 looks great; and my volume (sound) better too (compared to season 1 disc).
Plenty of good episodes to start RAWHIDE SEASON 2 VOLUME 1.  Director Jack Arnold (Creature From Black Lagoon; Incredible Shrinking Man; Gilligan's Island (!) tv fame) takes the reigns on at least one episode as does another B-movie director Gene Fowler Jr who helmmed the rather famous early Michael Landon ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"" as well as ""I Married A Monster From Outer Space"" with Gloria Talbot.
Victor McClaglen Jr. directs his dad - portraying a punch drunk, bare knuckle fighter - in a good episode with an effective performance by Anne Francis (Forbidden Planet).
Eventually Season 2 Volume 1 offers a string of episodes with plenty of ""real"" Texas (Arizona) footage -- even the drover camps are not sets!  Classic black-and-white! Picture is great!
The drovers feel cursed in the Saint Elmo's ""Blue"" fire episode when Skip Homeier (""the Gunfighter"" with Gregory Peck) appears like ""death"".
A prairie fire is reasonably well done in another (superimposed some ... but still not bad) episode.
""The Incident At River Station"" episode has a town paranoid and not trusting the ""new"" vaccination of small pox.  The death of a drover who had been vaccinated 8 years earlier causes much confusion and concern.
There are 16 episodes on volume 1 season 2 of RAWHIDE.
I will be checking out season 2 volume 2 soon.
Strong 4 stars but just a bit too dated for a 5 star rating, although this is great tv
for a season that ended in 1960.",1500163200,,1680,4.62751677852349
