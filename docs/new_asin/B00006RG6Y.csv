1789074,5,B00006RG6Y,"If you have bought Seasons 1-3 at the Best Buy ---DON'T Buy the ""Final Season"". It is simply the same episodes as what appears on the previous DVDs. The only thing you will get is Paul Gross doing commentary over Call of the Wild. (Which is great because I could listen to him recite the alphabet and be happy). Wish I knew how to get the ""Lost episodes"" because I know there are some missing!",1127952000,8,393,4.253333333333333

But those wanting quality will go for THIS much higher priced Canadian DVD from Alliance.  These are mastered for DVD by the production masters.

Season 3 will be around $20.  Very good quality sets, and I love this show.  I'm also a faithful amazon customer but please do check out what Best Buy has.",1123200000,8,317,4.147540983606557
1789078,5,B00006RG6Y,"By the time I discovered ""Due South,"" it was on A & E network in the early evening around dinner time.  Quickly, dinner moved from the dining room to the coffee table so we could watch the show and eat dinner at the same time.  You can't help but love Paul Gross, who plays the Benton Frasier role perfectly.  David Marciano does all the annoying/cynical things we Americans do.  Too bad that the viewing public didn't ""get"" this show when it was on network television.

Most interesting are some of the guest characters, most of whom are great Canadian actors like Leslie Nielsen.  The episode involving the RCMP Musical Ride on the train is hysterical, especially the bit with Nielsen in the toilet....you have to see it...defies explanation here.

Great comedic timing and writing; a cast of characters you really want to get to know and visit...often.",1122249600,3,855,4.775510204081633
1789079,4,B00006RG6Y,"I found Due South, season 1, packaged differently at Best Buy (the actual store, not BestBuy.com). The episodes were nicely placed on 4 single-sided discs, WITH the pilot, although no extras. The price was just under $20. I love Amazon.com and prefer to purchase from them, but the price here would limit the purchase of seasons 2 and 3(4).

Now to find the subsequent seasons at a reasonable price.",1120003200,5,399,4.782608695652174
1789080,5,B00006RG6Y,"I was searching for SCTV when I saw a reference to Due South, a program which I had never heard of before. I read about it and it sounded like a show I would like, so I bought it. My family and I just love it! What a sweet, and hilarious, show. I'm so glad it is available on DVD so that we could see it. It's just a wonderful show with great writing and great acting - quirky, funny, tender and wry - just great. I love Canadian humor so much (Red Green, Martin Short, John Candy, et al., etc...)and this is an excellent example. My only criticism: David Marciano (""Ray Veccio"") should be pictured on the DVD cover along with ""the Mountie"". David Marciano has a wonderful face and the greatest smile and was just terrific and essential to the show. I will buy the seasons with him in them but don't think I will try the later seasons when he was gone. The recurring ""bit"" with Ray Veccio and his Buick Riviera - wonderful. Love this show! Here we have another example of television when it is good, television how it can be, television how it so very rarely is. Treasure it when it happens. (Northern Exposure, St. Elsewhere, Barney Miller, Rockford Files, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Homicide: Life on the Street, Seinfeld, Dharma and Greg, and others such as these....)",1117584000,,1267,4.395744680851064
1789081,5,B00006RG6Y,Well i love this show and for anyone who is a big fan or can remember just a little bit of it.. GET IT!!!! the first season is good and there are some classic moments for big fans and is sure to bring back memories for people. i was only 9 or 10 when i first started watching due south and so of course it has brought back a piece of my life for me. if your in the UK get the express delivery and it will be at your house in a few days so do yourself a favour and buy all the DVD box sets as they are trully brilliant.,1107820800,,518,3.6339285714285716
1789082,1,B00006RG6Y,I too feel ripped off by Alliance Atlantis for releasing poorly MPEG encoded DVDs. Phone/mail and let them know how you feel. homevideo@allianceatlantis.com,1102464000,9,156,5.826086956521739
1789083,1,B00006RG6Y,"I am a huge fan of Due South and I have been ever since I watched it on television years ago, but over the years I forgot about it, but when I started internet shopping I saw the season 1 dvds listed and it was an instant purchase for me.

When the dvds arrived I watched the first few episodes with no problem, but as I got to the second disc I found that the first episode was corrupted, the playback would stop and start and then just freeze altogether making the episode unwatchable.  I looked through the rest of the episodes and found that two others had the same problem and most of them did not play back smoothly all the way through. Even the episodes that I could watch were made less enjoyable because of the jerky playback.

I was very much looking forward to having a marathon after so many years but now I've just lost all enthusiasm because the set has been so badly butchered.

Having read some other reviews I do not share the greivance over the double sided discs, the packaging or the lack of extras provided because I only wanted the episodes, but these are perfectly valid complaints.

I think that any true fan could probably look past these things, but to be sold a set this basic at an unfairly high price that is actually unwatchable is truly unbelievable to me, and I am disgusted with Alliance Atlantis for doing this to fans of the show.

Condsidering that they are involved in the 'CSI' shows which have been given perfectly good dvd trasnfers and most likely bought them large finacial success I cannot understand how they can treat Due South with so little respect that they cannot correctly encode or write the episodes to discs.

If you're a fan and are thinking of buying this then don't bother, save your money and hope that one day they issue a re-release that has been treated properly.

Oh, and if you're thinking I must have been unlucky and bought a dodgy set, then you'd be wrong, I've bought this set three times from three different sources and each one has suffered the same, in one set a disc came scratched from being loose in the box - another thing wrong with this set.

I love this show, but Alliance Atlantis owe me an apology and my money back before I buy anything from them again.",1102032000,24,2233,4.413625304136253
1789094,5,B00006RG6Y,"This show is great - it's witty, funny, and you can watch it with your family as it is also inoffensive. A mismatch between a do-gooder, overly polite Canadian mountie and a jaded Chicago detective, this series is definitely worth owning. The packaging is simple, and the pilot isn't on it (by a different company, and I believe it's avaiable with one of the other seasons), but those in no way detract from a classy, funny show that is great family fun.",1098316800,2,454,4.548780487804878
1789095,5,B00006RG6Y,"This same DVD sells for $53 CDN at Amazon's Canadian store.  Even adding $12 for international shipping, that comes to about $50 in US dollars, whereas Amazon here is selling it for $111.

1789096,4,B00006RG6Y,"This was (and is) a wonderful series, especially in terms of the witty writing, screenplay, top-notch acting and general entertainment value. Great to see it on DVD (not yet available in Region 2 where I live, despite the series' popularity kere in the UK). I can understand other reviewers' gripes with the packaging but in the end it's the episodes on the discs that I bought it for and therein lies my only critcism; the quality of the pressings seems less than might be expected from a commercial release and on ""Chicago Holiday Pt. 1"" the picture fragments, freezes and jumps chapters.  Don't let this put prospective purchasers off though - it's worth buying - but it makes you wonder if quality control standards vary, just as with anything else you buy anywhere!  Amazon.ca is definitely value for money and even with shipping costs to the UK I have found them to be very competitive. Thank you kindly!",1096502400,4,910,4.753164556962025
1789097,4,B00006RG6Y,"Ok, this show is truly one of the best shows ever made and I applaud the fact that we, the fans, are finally able to own the show on DVD. However, BOO to the company that put this out for thinking that this is acceptable packaging. The DVD case is the lousiest and cheapest design I have EVER seen and there are absolutely no extras. Add to that the fact that the pricing fluctuates highly depending on where you buy it. Basically I get the impression that the company doesn't WANT this to sell and/or are only grudgingly releasing it. Suffice it to say that it looks like it cost them a few cents to make this collection and yet they are charging over $100. And studio executives wonder why piracy is so rampant? Show some respect to this show and the fans, guys!",1092787200,7,764,4.3125
1789098,5,B00006RG6Y,"I watched this show when it was on television, on reruns, and in syndication. I purchased all the products from the website. I use the ""Pizzas and Promises"" episode for instruction in my high school television production unit. I listen to the music from the shows while dirving. Now I can watch the shows over and over.

 The scripts are tight. The characterization reflects consideration of personal experiences. The stories keep the viewer watching. The visuals are strategically placed. Nothing is taken for granted -- once the viewer knows what to look for, in rewind or second viewing, one can actually see what Benton Fraser observes and reports. The humor is clever. Fraser's ""life lessons"" are delightful (""Duck means duck"" or ""Don't follow a man over a cliff"" or ""When the Inuit go fishing...""). The wolf's ""dialogue"" with Fraser cracks me up.

 Paul Gross curls my toes. Benton Fraser does it for me also.",1091404800,17,915,4.922077922077922
1789099,5,B00006RG6Y,"I was delighted to see that you could finally get Due South on DVD but I can't believe how stupid, insensitive and greedy distributors have been not to include the pilot episode in the Season 1 Box Set - I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING THE SEASON 1 BOX SET UNTIL THIS DISGRACEFUL OVERSIGHT IS RECTIFIED!!!!!!!!!  I know Due South was brilliant and the fans shouldn't be ripped off like this by leaving out THE PILOT - how STUPID!!!

1789100,5,B00006RG6Y,"(...)I definitely do not like the packaging, two discs are overlapping a little on their sides. They should have done it where each disc has their own folder .. folding out, that would not compromise on the size/width of the boxset either if that was an issue. When I received the DVDs from the courier, two discs in each boxset were loose and not in their holders. Although I don't think one can damage the discs too much .. unless you're really really careless. Not sure how it'll be down the line in a couple of years ..
For the price, I expected something better. For example, SG1 boxsets which are almost half the price have much better packaging - single boxes for each disc (5 discs total for whole season, like Due South). Or like 24 where it's a fold out box with each disc having their own holder.
As for the show, there are definitely no complaints there. It's all wonderfully crisp and clear, and no commercials! One gripe, as other reviewers have mentioned is that the pilot isn't released as well. Although I've heard that they now will include it in Season 3 boxset which will be forthcoming later this year.

1789101,3,B00006RG6Y,"I buy a lot of TV series on DVD and have grown to expect certain standards that this does not live up to.  Although i would never critisise the episodes themselves.  They are beautifully written and brilliantly acted and directed.  However, the boxset itself lets down the quality of the programme.  The outside of the box is fine but the inside is cheap.  Three double sided DVDs, not much in the way of literature and no special features.  Add to that, the original Pilot episode is not included and is unavailable on DVD.  When I compare this to other popular TV shows such as Buffy and Angel there is no comparison.  You get the full series on six disks, audio commentries, overviews, extra features, documentaries, and scripts.  All of this is in a beautifully designed boxset with the disks blending in with the boxes design.  To make it short, the three stars are for the programme itself but the boxset gets 1 at best.  Poor presentation and a missing episode.  If the makers are reading this, sort it out.",1078617600,2,1014,4.603351955307263
1789102,5,B00006RG6Y,I was absolutely thrilled when I discovered due South was on DVD. I got season one as soon as I could (I'm saving up for 2 and 3!). I didn't have any problems with the discs and their packaging. I would like to have seen some bonus features and the pilot included but the DVDs are still great without them.,1076025600,,306,4.116666666666666
1789113,1,B00006RG6Y,"What moron was responsible for this DVD release ?  How can a fantastic series such as this be treated is this shoddy way. Only three double sided disks for the whole series. The MPEG compression is far too high and very noticable. The disks  arrived with one disk floating in the box, scratched. The problem is these disks WILL be bought by the fans, and the company WILL make a profit. I have bought the first two series. I won't be buying the third.

1789114,3,B00006RG6Y,"First off, let me get this out of the way right now:  I love this show.  When I saw that it was out on DVD I immediately ordered both seasons.  One copy for me, one copy for my Dad for Christmas.
Both copies of season 1 arrived with disc one loose in the case, featuring a massive scratch on one side.  I tried a disc polisher on it, and it fixed the scratch.  Later (after it was too late to return it) I noticed a crack in two of the three discs.  They were probably there to begin with, but were aggravated by the clips in the case that the discs come in, which hold each disc so tightly that you have to warp the disc to remove it.
So I ordered another copy, figuring that it was just a shipping problem, since both season 1 sets came in the same order.  But the new shipment came with disc one rattling loose in the case and a big ugly scratch on one side.
But no cracks, so I can use my disc polisher to fix it.
Still, if it someone hadn't been such a cheap b@st@rd about the DVD case, this whole fiasco could have been avoided.
Contentwise, the discs are great.  I like the fact that you can just watch all four episodes on a side without returning to the menu.  The chapter breaks are in bizarre places, so if you try to skip past the opening credits you wind up halfway through the episode somewhere.
That's why it gets three stars.  Five stars for content, one star for packaging.",1073347200,,1390,4.095940959409594
1789115,2,B00006RG6Y,"I love Due South, but presentation of these dvds is quite simply below par.  The dvds are doublesides, which makes them extra vulnerable to damage, which is all too frequent considering the dvd case they come in.  The three dvds overlap each in a case, which refuses to let go of the dvds in question.  Detaching the dvds from the case can only be achieved by causing cracks on the dvd.  If you buy this season, as Due South fans inevitably will, do not keep the dvds in these case.  Use separate jewel cases for them.",1070496000,,518,4.354166666666667

1789120,4,B00006RG6Y,"Like so many others, I was ecstatic when my Due South DVDs arrived in the mail.  However, I see I'm not the only person who was slightly disappointed by the presentation.  The flaws in presentation are why I only gave the set 4 stars instead of 5.  In my opinion, Alliance Atlantis didn't put a lot of effort into this set.  I was hoping that they would put more effort into future sets, since this one sold so well, but it wasn't apparent in the second set.  I hold out hope that the third season will be more polished.
First of all, the 2-hour Pilot was NOT included in the ""Complete First Season.""  Mindboggling, especially since there was room on the DVDs - the third DVD had 6 episodes instead of 8.  The inclusion of the Pilot would have also meant that both parts of ""Victoria's Secret"" would have been on the same side of Disc 3.  As it stands, you have to flip the disc to see part 2, which interrupts the flow of that episode.
I was also disappointed to find that the DVDs contain absolutely nothing in the way of bonus features.  The ability to choose from either English or French subtitles and audio tracks just doesn't cut it.  Sorry.  Other TV series sets have set the bar for this one, and the Due South DVDs, sorry to say, don't achieve those high expectations.
The third & last flaw in the set is the truly abysmal design of the case.  I've never seen another set that crammed 3 discs into one case, requiring that two discs overlap each other and that the third disc is more or less hidden under the insert.  The overlapping discs are very hard to remove, and I'm sure I'm not the only person who worries about breaking or scratching the discs.  I bought extra DVD cases just for these discs, to avoid the overlapping case.
I will say, though, that other than those flaws, I'm very happy with this set and the second set.  Finally getting to see the episodes without commercials or interference is heaven.  The sound and picture quality are very good.  I sincerely hope that the complete series (including the Pilot!!) is available on DVD soon.",1063584000,119,2063,4.429708222811671

I do have a couple of complaints with the actual production of the DVDs, though.  First, where's the Pilot?!!!  There is enough empty space in the set that it could have been included.  It would help explain what is going on in later episodes.  Besides, I seem to remember that it was hilarious and I'd like to laugh at it again.  Second, there has to be a better way of packaging the discs.  Having two discs overlaid is extremely awkward, to say the least.  For these reasons I gues I'll have to award this delightful set only five stars.

1789135,4,B00006RG6Y,"I find myself in a kind of love//hate relationship with the Season 1 DVD Box of Due South.  The set has some good features (For example, being able to play all episodes on a disc in a row without returning to the menu) but also some really silly mistakes.  The biggest of these have been mentioned before in almost every review here, but I'll restate them anyway.
The set is called the ""complete first season"", yet it lacks the 2-hour pilot episode.  What was Alliance/Atlantis smoking when they made this decision?  If they wanted to be greedy, corporate jerks they could have released the pilot separately FIRST and charged full price for it, but it should have been included in the Season 1 box (there's room for it).  As it stands, newcomers to the series have no idea what's going on.  They aren't introduced to any of the characters properly.  They don't know why Fraser is in Chicago or how he met Ray, etc.  Sloppy sloppy.  They'd better not decide to release some Special Edition season 1 box down the road that does include the pilot is all I have to say.
 Next on the hit list are the DVDs themselves.  They're 2-sided, although I believe at least 2 of them are DVD-18s (dual-sided, dual-layered) and I applaud A/A for the effort but there's a reason why DVD-18 never caught on.  With the release of DVD changers (players that hold between 2 and 200 DVDs) it's simply more convenient to have 2 dual-layered DVDs instead of one DVD-18 that you have to get up and flip over (anyone having LaserDisc flashbacks?).  Despite the annoyance, the DVD-18 format does allow 8 episodes to a disc and still have them all be good quality (better than many newer series I own).  Very few features are included, but they were always secondary to quality of presentation, in my opinion.
 The case itself is also flawed in that it is simply a modified 2-disc case.  Discs 2 and 3 overlap so one must be removed before the other.  Again, sloppy sloppy.
 Having Due South in any form is greatly appreciated, but let's see the pilot released separately now (at a decent price please) and when season 2 is released, let's see 6 dual-layered discs rather than 3 DVD-18s.",1046995200,4,2159,4.578125

Its wonderful having all these amazing episodes on dvd and having the option of playing them anytime you want.

Also, this set includes none of the extras that usually come with DVDs (like commentaries, interviews, trailers...) and the case is very poorly designed.
Other than that, it's of course wonderful to watch due South again and to finally own it on DVD (well, at least parts of it).",1042416000,,547,4.5353535353535355
1789138,3,B00006RG6Y,"Due South ranks highly on my ""Favorite TV-Shows of All-Time"" list.  As someone who doesn't like TV in general, except for sports, I couldn't help falling in love with this show when it was on the air.  It is wonderful to know I will always be able to check out this sleeper series whenever I want.  That being said, the DVDs themselves are actually somewhat disappointing.  The case the discs come in is awful.  I never saw a case that required you to slip the insert over top of one of the discs.  The other two discs are staggered over each other on the opposite side and are somewhat difficult to remove.  The discs are pretty bare bones with only still backgrounds and no motion menus.  For those of you who are really picky, you'll notice the picture jump from time to time as a result of a poor telecining process.  Alliance, please take note when/if you deliver Season 2 & 3.  As unfortunate as this is, you'll soon forget once immersed in the series' wonderful story lines.",1041724800,,981,4.46067415730337
1789139,5,B00006RG6Y,"I am big fan of criminal drama such as Law and Order, CSI, The Practice.  I first came across Due South when I was living in Malaysia but I never had a chance to watch it.  I just got the DVD set and as soon as I watched the first episode I loved it! It is a combination of action and comedy, and very unique!",1041552000,,309,3.7384615384615385
1789140,5,B00006RG6Y,This is the only way to watch a season of a tv series! And Due South is the BEST Cop/Action/Comedy/Adventure/Drama series that has ever been made. I hope Alliance et al releases Season Two as soon as possible!,1040860800,,209,4.526315789473684
1789141,5,B00006RG6Y,Wonderful to have the abiltiy to re-view Due South.  In the U.S. I haven't found any station that is rerunning the series so this is the next best thing! Only disappointment is that the Pilot is not included in the DVD.,1040688000,,219,4.341463414634147
1789142,5,B00006RG6Y,"Due South is a heart-warming thing very much, though it is a criminal drama.
And characters (wolf is included) and music have wonderful all.
I expect that the series which follows this work and it will be put on the market also in Japan in which I live.",1040601600,,253,4.291666666666667
7972630,4,B00006RG6Y,"This is my favorite cop show.  This is the Canadian version of the set which is much better video quality than the US version.  My only issue with set is that the discs are double sided.  At least for me anyways, double sided disks seem to get scratched much easier.",1500508800,,266,4.28
7972631,1,B00006RG6Y,"I bought the Due South Ultimate Collection and am so disappointed.  I have scene the entire collection several times on Netflix and loved it.  However, the CDs I received are a mess.  I have watched the first two discs (about 6 episodes per disc) and 1 to 2 episodes on each disc ""freeze"" for no reason (as if someone put it on pause) - nothing works except to stop that episode and go on to the next one. Also, it is in ""crop"" format, not wide screen or full screen.  Extremely disappointing as the series is wonderful.  I would return it but not worth the hassle.",1386460800,,565,4.2924528301886795

7972634,5,B00006RG6Y,Season One (1) and Season Two (2) are available now at Target for $5 each.  Season One (1) includes the two hour pilot episode.  I loved them both.  I cannot wait for Season Three (3) and Season Four (4) to arrive at the store.  I plan to buy them both.,1319587200,,253,4.0

Benton has help from his deaf wolf, Diefenbaker, in fighting criminals.  Ray's family is a bunch of characters, to say the least.  There are also huge personality and cultural differences between the two guys, but that doesn't stop them from bonding and learning from each other.",1287792000,,462,4.822784810126582
7972636,5,B00006RG6Y,An absolutely unique and delightful show!  BUT...stop at the end of Season Two.  Season Three is almost wholly abominable.,1185926400,,122,5.368421052631579
7972637,5,B00006RG6Y,"Thanks to other reviews for this item I was aware of both the difference in image quality, what constituted the various ""seasons"" of this series, and the mismatch in cost of the sets between Amazon US and Amazon Canada.

Having ordered all 4 of the Canadian seasons I can say there's no question the image quality on these sets is terrific.  By getting them through Amazon Canada I got them for a comparable price to the other US sold sets listed on Amazon (and available through Best Buy).  It took maybe an extra week to receive them but this was mostly due to availability so otherwise it was still pretty prompt.

As to the show I am still going through the seasons but Season 1 has been a delight.  Unfortunately the pilot episode is available only on the Season 3 box set.  While it helps to have seen the pilot, if you only want to try out the first season it's not critical to have seen it.  I'm betting though that you will want to see more after the first set so a purchase of both seasons at the same time will not be a bad bet.

If you do buy Season 3 at the same time, this is the only one of the 4 that did not use double sided discs.  For some reason the discs were also very loose meaning all 4 had moved all over the box when it was opened.  So far it doesn't seem to have damaged the discs, but you may want to check them as soon as you receive the package.",1174262400,3,1375,4.097014925373134
7972638,5,B00006RG6Y,"""Due South"" was a classic! The first season, with RCMP Constable Benton Frasier, (accompanied by his deaf wolf, Diefenbaker) totally removed from his Yukon roots, and dealing with his friend and reluctant partner, Chicago Detective Ray Vecchio was absolutely classic. Some of the best scenes, though, take place in Ray's precinct squad room, where his harried Lieutenant Welsh (Canadian actor Beau Starr) was always trying to figure out, ""just how does the mountie figure into this?""

Great, great show. I have the whole series.",1173916800,,528,5.285714285714286
7972639,4,B00006RG6Y,"This is a note about the cheaper Best Buy DVD's that some here have mentioned.  While it is true that Best Buy tends to sell the sets cheaper, as far as I know there is no new edition of the Due South season sets.

The version listed here is the Canadian DVD release (note that it says ""import"" on the product description) by Alliance Atlantis (the company that produced Due South).

What you may be seeing at Best Buy is the *far* cheaper US release ""Platinum"" DVD's which do include the pilot in the season 1 set.  However, do note that these have a lower screen quality whereas the Canadian version has been digitally remastered.  The Platinum DVD's do not have at least one few voice-over commentary present in the Canadian release.

This more expensive Canadian release has the 'misplaced' pilot inserted in the third season set, the additional 'Final Fourth Season' set (which is encorporated in the Platinum set's third season set), troublesome double-sided DVD's, and unreliable packaging with DVD's that come loose during shipment.

That said, Best Buy Canada does seem to carry the Canadian sets at prices cheaper than those listed on Amazon.com *and* Amazon.ca.

You decide whether you want price or screen quality!",1152748800,9,1226,4.888888888888889
