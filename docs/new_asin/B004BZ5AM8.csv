4320761,4,B004BZ5AM8,"Ignore the people who down this film. Their problem is they want 24/7 action.

This movie picks up right after the second and puts you right into action. He is captured tortured but still fights back.

 Following these events there is a chunk of the film used to see his recovery and what is going on with the King and Crow as well.

After that is when we are thrust into the final confrontation.

My only problem with this movie is there is a part where after a really good fight the movie coulda ended there but Jaa decided to try and please both crowds who wanted a certain ending.

You will without a doubt know this scene when you see it.

I will say still see this movie but get it when its marked down. The fight scenes are still good and this movie aside from scene mentioned above is well rounded.",1288656000,,806,4.228758169934641
4320762,2,B004BZ5AM8,"This movie was a big  disapppointment, the second one was AWESOME!  The last fight scene should have been in the third one.  Theres one pretty cool fight scene in the beginning, then it goes into you typical martial arts action hero defeat story in which I have no problem with, but they dragged it on to long,  Tony Jaa ""Tein"" gets his bones broken and goes thru recovery, then trying to decide whether or not he should fight anymore or if he should continue to live anymore.  Then he has some wise words then he starts training,(they really dragged his training out to long in this movie) re-unites with lost love, and begins his mission for revenge.  I said it about Ong Bak 2 that stupid crow guy is the worst villian ever, not because hes sinister hes just stupid,  in this movie they use a lot of ""wire-fu"" In which I hate The last fight scene was about maybe pushing 8 to 9 minutes, but personally I only thought the first 4 and a half was cool the rest just seemed like a really lame Jet Li fight scene.......  Just not the Tony Jaa that Im use to, Oh yea theres some weird mystical power which was weird.  I promise you that in the last fight scene your going to say ""what?"" atleast 8 times, and not because you cant believe what you just saw, a lot of stuff that just doesnt make sense.  I really gave this movie 2 stars only because it was associated with the ""Ong Bak"" series.  The movie looked great, how it was shot and etc.  But just disappointing.",1288310400,,1463,4.28
4320763,5,B004BZ5AM8,"This was a step up from Ong Bak 2, that put me to sleep in a couple parts. The action is vintage Tony Jaa. They tried too hard to actually make a plot. That was the great thing about Ong Bak 1, they didn't put ANY effort into the plot, so you just focused on the action. The action here is great. Stunts are great. People got hurt making this movie. Definitely a must see",1287273600,,371,3.96
4320764,1,B004BZ5AM8,Don't waste your time or money - his previous films are much better. Half the movie has to do with him recovering from being captured in Ong Bak 2 and from beatings the enemy gave him in the beginning of this picture. The fighting scenes aren't anything special either compared to what Tony Jaa is capable of doing.,1287014400,3,315,4.448275862068965
4320765,1,B004BZ5AM8,This movie didn't make any sense at all. Pretty much the same action moves you've seen from his other movies...blows to the head with his elbows and knees. How can he exact revenge on his murdered parents if the bad guy is already dead?!? What a waste of time watching this,1286841600,2,273,4.372549019607843

4320810,5,B004BZ5AM8,"This is an excellent film! Putting aside the incredible fight sequences for a moment, there is a deep spiritual and love centered story here. I understand the difficulty in reading a film (subtitles) while trying to pay attention to the visuals, it takes one out of the story sometimes. Things get lost in translation and we inevitably blame the storytelling.
  Lots of people have written here that the storylines do not connect, but that is only due to the fact that Thai, Chinese, and Japanese films don't spoon feed us the plot, they want us to think and reflect. We need to understand that we as American aren't as thoughtful as other cultures, I say that with sadness.
  There is much to take away from these films, especially if you love martial arts.
The fight scenes are amazing, especially after the second act. I don't want to spoil the ending, just trust me, he will astound you as always.",1482105600,,901,4.647798742138365

In this, the third film in the series, Tien is captured but then is rescued by his villagers. The villagers teach him the more spiritual sides of martial arts but all is not well. His kidnappers return for him and the fight ensues! This movie has been described my multiple reviewers as ""amazing, ultra violent, and with fight sequences that are second to none"".

4320872,3,B004BZ5AM8,"Much like The Protector 2 Tony Jaa does another unnecessary sequel that shouldn't have been set up from the previous movie to begin with. Had it not been for how the 2nd Ong Bak movie ended I wouldn't have wasted my time with this mediocre film. The reason for that description is simply because of the fight scenes being the ONLY watchable parts this movie actually had to offer. That being said the main climactic showdown between the films' two lead stars which was set up in the earlier movie was one of the biggest letdowns I've seen in years. The build up to a final showdown should never be better or overshadow the actual battle itself, & in this case it most certainly did. I'm not even referring to the build up in the actual film itself either. I'm talking about that simple 5 min. confrontation the two stars had in the previous movie while riding on top of an elephant. That fight scene was way more epic than what took place at the end of this film. Now I know that in previous reviews about films like this one (Martial Arts) I've always stated that going into seeing a movie such as this for it's story is utterly ridiculous, because that's not what they're made for. They're there to entertain us with a lot of action/fight scenes, & nothing more other than that. However, I still must comment on this films' story because truthfully it is just plain unbearable. I won't get into any details as to why I completely disregard it because it might be as boring as the story itself, but I will say that it just takes what wasn't a completely terrible telling of these characters from the previous movie, & just goes into an odd & much too long direction of rehabilitation for the main character in the 2nd act of the movie. If you didn't really care about the story in the first movie (which is really the 2nd in a trilogy that really doesn't connect to one another) then you should seriously save your money on this, & just watch the fight scenes on youtube. You might appreciate it more.",1437782400,,2002,4.442934782608695

4320887,2,B004BZ5AM8,"This is definitely THE WORST of the entire ""Ong-Bak"" series. The only good fight scene is when Dan Chupong (as a pretty scary villain named Bhuti, who subdues Tony Jaa at the end of Ong-Bak 2) kills a bunch of Lord Rajasena's guards. Tony Jaa's work is quite unimpressive here.

For those of you unfamiliar with the story of how 2 Ong-Bak ""prequels"" got made, I'll give you the skinny. There was originally supposed to be only 1 movie, Ong-Bak 2. And this was Tony Jaa's first time directing. However, the inexperienced Tony Jaa ended up falling behind schedule and going over budget, and eventually just walked off the set, leaving the project at a standstill for months.

Sahamonkhol then came in and offered to give more money to the project. But in an effort to recoup its losses, they brought in much of the old team from the first ""Ong-Bak"" and ""Tom Yum Goong"" films, and also added a villainous character played by Dan Chupong (as mentioned earlier), as he was fresh off of his fame ""Born to Fight"" and ""Dynamite Warrior."" And they decided to make this entire ""prequel"" into 2 films.

In spite of not-so-good reviews by most fans, it worked. ""Ong-Bak 2"" ended on a cliffhanger, therefore making a viewing of Ong-Bak 3 necessary if you're curious about what happens to Tien (Tony Jaa).",1433635200,,1291,4.6535087719298245

I did not see Ong Bak 1 or 2 but from what I can gather Ong Bak is the downtrodden average joe with super-human martial arts skills.  His life appears to be the result of karma punishing him from whatever he did in former live(s) but after an almost death experience his Shraman heals him and guides him towards the greater path.  With this new found knowledge and regaining his karma he goes to fight the crow.  I won't give away the final part of the movie but it was okay - I liked it.

A monk - with the help of the girl - leads him back to a calmness of soul, and he and she dance a beautiful, stylized routine which is dazzling and remarkable. Then - when the tyrant attacks and also brutally abuses elephants, the young man draws on his restored calm, and finds himself able to defeat the bad guys through his smooth and effortless movement, and free of malice.

4321018,2,B004BZ5AM8,"What happened?  Tony Jaa, what happened?  Screenplay by Tony Jaa?  Directed by...Tony Jaa?  Starring Tony Jaa?  Fire your handler, dude.  Tony Jaa has gone temporary Sylvester Stallone in this movie making big moments out of no moments, teasing out a scene that could last 30 seconds and turning it into 10 (fairly excruciating) minutes, throwing in a bunch of apparently profound mystical platitudes and mumbo jumbo (perhaps this is so to an American audience and not so much so to a Thai or oriental audience?), and putting his face and form really big on the screen.  The result was one of the worst martial arts movies that I have seen.  Ever.

While the film looks pretty and you can tell there was moolah put into the production values in the film you don't get the blazing physical and acrobatic martial arts action that satisfied and even dazzled in ""Ong Bak"" and ""The Protector"".  Not only do you not get this (which is ostensibly why most people would be watching this film) but what you do get mostly comes in the last 15 minutes of the film and let's just say that the choreography leaves a lot to be desired.

I was mixed on Ong Bak 2 but really because of the incomprehensible story style.  That style follows here, unfortunately, but whereas 2 had some interesting and good fight sequences 3 is really a total letdown.  It's a case of style over substance I'm sorry to say.

For those who have enjoyed the previous outings and have heard skeptical reviews of this film?  I, too, having seen it now warn you off.  Only see this if you don't have to pay for it (even then you'll want money back!) and only pay for it if you're a cult Jaa fan or completist.

But getting back to this film, I can think of no other film where the lead character spends so much time comatose before reviving and triumphing. I like Tony Jaa and think he's amazing.

4321055,2,B004BZ5AM8,"I enjoyed this film a little. The music is amazing and the best of the three films. Also, Tony Jaa acts a bit more in this film and you can see him growing as an actor, but fights a bit less in exchange. The Tony Jaa fights were still great but extremely limited for 1 hour 40 minute film.

The paranormal aspects of this film were the biggest issues in my opinion. They only played a minor role in the second film, but play a larger role in this film. For a film series that had some of the most amazing, realistic fights, this film brings the most unrealistic fights with the Crow villain; don't expect the realism that was evident in the original. A lot of talk about curses, by the way. The supernatural parts of this movie probably could've worked if this was a standalone film, but it's a direct sequel. Also, a significant amount of time is spent on repetitive training and dancing montages. If they were a little shorter, then maybe the movie wouldn't feel like it was dragging.

Ong-Bak 3 does some things right, but it does most wrong. Fans of the first two will most likely be disappointed by the third. They'll definitely be disappointed by the limited Tony Jaa fights. I don't recommend it unless you have time to kill. (available on Netflix streaming as of 6/13/12).",1339545600,,1280,4.465811965811966

4321060,3,B004BZ5AM8,"In my opinion,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak-2-The-Beginning/dp/B002XTXG1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong Bak 2: The Beginning</a>&nbsp;and its trilogy-ending sequel here should have been made as a single movie. For ""OB2,"" this would've done away with its frustrating cliffhanger ending, and it would have ensured that ""Ong Bak 3"" here would not have been as ultimately boring as it is. I can only theorize that writer/director/star Tony Jaa took the criticisms of the last one's lack of story to heart and decided to have this one focus primarily on furthering the plot and expanding both major and minor characters - at the expense of its two predecessors' excellent fight scenes. It's not a bad movie but definitely a step down from every other Jaa vehicle in recent memory.

The story: maimed by the vindictive Lord Ratchaseina (Sarunyu Wongkrachang,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/13-Game-of-Death/dp/B00118T61O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">13: Game of Death</a>), Tien the rebel hero (Jaa) is rescued prior to his execution but now must find a way to regain his strength to stop the ascension of the demonic Crow Ghost (Dan Chupong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-to-Fight/dp/B000K2V7DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born to Fight</a>).

The movie introduces several new thematic features into the storyline, the most prominent of which are dark magic and lessons in Buddhism; both clash, but while the latter aspect manages to assimilate itself well enough into the plot, the former goes over as well as a chili pepper mixed in with cookie batter. It's just too jarring, and it's never explained why it suddenly shows up in a story that's mostly been played straight until now. Sadly, when Crow Ghost isn't inexplicably giving people headaches or making tattoos glide across his body, Tony's rather boring rehabilitative scenes take point. Training scenes have been a highlight in any martial arts movie since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jean-Claude-Van-Damme-s-own-visit-to-Thailand/dp/0783114885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jean-Claude Van Damme's own visit to Thailand</a>, but it just isn't fun watching Tony learn to dance (yes, he dances) and reacquire his flexibility, regardless of how hard the orchestral score tries to make you take it seriously, because it just takes too damn long. Less is more, Tony!

As far as the fighting goes, I'm even more disappointed. Rest assured, ""Ong Bak 3"" remains one of the better action movies of 2011, but it's still officially the first Jaa solo outing in which he doesn't outdo himself. There are six fight scenes, at least one of which is very good but of which at least two are mediocre, and sadly, these latter ones include the climatic showdown between Tony and Dan Chupong. You'd think a fight like this would be a given showstopper, but in the end it's a surprisingly short, contained, and one-sided encounter wherein Tony's waving arms somehow trounce Dan's chops, knee strikes, and capoeira kicks (in press releases, co-director Panna Rittikrai spoke of a fighting style developed for the movie that could be practiced ""bonelessly""; if that's what Tony's pseudo tai chi is supposed to be, ol' Panna needs to be slapped). If, as I suggested earlier, these scenes had been mixed in with all the kick-butt fights of the earlier film, they'd be easier to forgive, but on their own and by comparison, they lack ingenuity.

One good thing the film acquires from its predecessor is nice art direction, and the hermit character of Petchtai Wongkamlao (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bodyguard-series/dp/B0019F02U8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bodyguard series</a>) is also expanded a bit and gets a couple funny lines. However, this is where the river runs dry, and I can only conclude that the filmmakers took themselves way too seriously in the making of this one - why else focus on a drag-along story when there were better action scenes to be had? If you watch Tony Jaa for the reason most other people do, you'll almost definitely be disappointed, but hopefully not too much. I mean, ""Ong Bak 3"" isn't great, but at least it's not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Warrior/dp/B000UVV2AG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle Warrior</a>, right?",1325894400,,4480,6.017241379310345

4321062,2,B004BZ5AM8,"When I watch a Tony Jaa movie.  I expect a lot of plausible, realistic (for a movie) fighting that looks bone-crunchingly painful.

Ong Bak 3 has minimal fighting, and is more like a crappy Asian drama with no cohesion that just happens to have some fight scenes in it.  For the majority of the few fight scenes that do happen, there is use of wires and CG.  The reason Ong Bak 1 and 2 were so good is because they didn't include that crap.  There is one fight involving the Crow character from the end of Ong Bak 2 vs. a bunch of lackeys, and the wire jumps and CG make it plodding and unimmersive.

It also seems like the director was trying too hard to be ""cinematic"".  Many parts of the movie just feel cheesy, and it is extremely apparent you are watching a movie.  When watching Ong-Bak 1 & 2, I felt like I was witnessing a story, not watching a movie.  I got absorbed into Ong Bak 1 & 2, but not 3.

Overall, the fight scenes feel very weak.  The first fight scene is conceptually cool (I won't say much about it in case you do watch the film), and the second to last fight is the only real stellar fight.  That scene is Tony Jaa in his element:  No wires or CG, restrained & non-intrusive use of slow-mo, and furious combat against many foes.  Frankly, it's the only reason I didn't give the movie 1 star.

TL;DR - The movie is more like an over-the-top asian drama, with quite a few moments of ""Aw, that's B.S"" weak supernatural storytelling.

Two Thai action stars Tony Jaa and Dan Chupong are in one film. This should be a great action flick, you might think. Wrong. ""Ong Bak 3"" is not. Stunts themselves are not bad, but there are so many things gone wrong in the second sequel of ""Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior,"" which put Jaa's name on the map, that I don't know where to start.

First, the story. The story of ""Ong Bak 3"" picks up where the predecessor left off - that's fine - but instead of furthering it to a crowd-pleasing climax, it gets just muddled. The serviceable (if not great) plot of the original ""Ong Bak"" with a simple ""good guys vs. bad guys"" format is gone, replaced by a more philosophical (and tedious) storyline that only slows down the entire film.

Next, the action. There are a couple of nice action set-pieces (one about the captive hero fighting desperately, and the other at the end using elephants with huge tusks). Watch the trailers and you will see Tony Jaa delivering gravity-defying kicks. His eye-popping stunts are amazing as ever, but they lack something - emotional impact, perhaps.

In ""Ong Bak 3"" Jaa plays the hero named Tien, but (sorry if I missed it) I don't know for what he is fighting, and this makes it hard for us to identify with his character. Also, Tien apparently dies, but is brought back to life by a Buddhist monk, who helps him to recuperate from his wounds. This means you have to wait for Jaa's bone-crunching martial arts action scenes quite long. The incoherent subplots do not help, with supernatural elements that are only doing harm to the already confusing story of the film.

By the time we finally get what we want - the battle between Tien and a crow-like baddie played by Dan Chupong - the film is almost over, and the climactic fight sequences are damaged by one narrative gimmick that is simply unnecessary. After all, like the second and third ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" installments, they made two sequels when we only need one.",1314316800,,2022,4.636871508379889
4321070,1,B004BZ5AM8,"Ong Bak 2, despite its serious drawbacks, became Tony Jaa's most successful film yet. To clean up the loose ends left by the disorganized and chaotic production, the studio went ahead and made a third film - Ong Bak 3 - but this movie is no less a hot mess than Ong Bak 2. It's just a different kind of hot mess.

Ong Bak 3 has a clearer story than its predecessor. But instead of just tying up all the loose ends from Ong Bak 2, the third movie adds more subplots! We learn that there's a curse on...all Thailand? The village? Oh, I don't know! There's a curse. The evil king has captured and is slowly torturing Tien (Jaa) to death while uttering the most cliched Jabba the Hutt bad guy laugh ever - literally: hah hah haaah! hah hah haaah! However, he's also going nuts because - as we learn from yet another flashback - he poisoned his predecessor to get the throne. Then there's that weird crow fighter. He's back and turns out to be some kind of evil spirit (I think?) who wants to take the throne so that he can...um, I have no idea why this crow-spirit-thing exists or what it's really after. Meanwhile, Tien is rescued deus ex machina by royal decree and carted off to his village to slough off his vengeful nature through meditation. It got to the point where I just didn't care! ""Please Ong Bak 3!"" I screamed. ""Pick a plotline...ANY plotline...and just get ON with it!""

Ong Bak 3 is filmed with a much more appealing style than #2, so the feel of the movie is less oppressive. We even get some beautiful shots of Thailand, as opposed to the muddy, rainy slopheap Ong Bak 2 seemed determined to portray Thailand as. However, this improvement is undermined as Ong Bak 3 takes on a religious subtext that is truly from outer space. Nothing against a religious subtext, but this stuff is nutty with a capital 'freak' and I couldn't figure out what religion this subtext is supposed to reflect. There's tons of Jesus imagery: the 'chosen one' dies a death of crucifixion level violence, is resurrected, and then provides salvation to his people. Jaa even grows a beard and wears white when fighting the evil-crow-thing, and he hurls his wooden staff down to put everyone on alert that he's there to free the slaves. Moses and Jesus all wrapped up in one? Yeesh. The whole thing is so heavy handed that it quickly goes over the line (WAY over the line!) and becomes a messianic ego-trip for Jaa.

There's some Buddhist/Zen Buddhist philosophy rattling around in the script like a loose pebble in a rusty bucket, but it seems more like window dressing than anything seriously presented. But the worst aspect of religious theme is the over the top supernatural aspects. For example, the crow spirit summons an eclipse at one point, and at another sends wicked black smoke at a monk (never did figure out that the heck that smoke was all about). Later, Tien summons white lighting after he dispels the eclipse. What religion does all this hocus-pocus bullcrap come from? Wicca maybe? No, I can't even say that because it'd be insulting to Wiccans. Long story short, a religious subtext has to have some kind of consistent morality or philosophy. Otherwise it's just a whole bunch of crazy.

Worst of all - for all the backstory in these two movies - by the end of Ong Bak 3 I still have little understanding of what and why most of the action in the film took place. Why is killing Tien so important to the evil king? Why did he kill Tien's parents? Why did the king's boss allow Tien to live? How did Tien end up captured by the slavers? Why does the one guy become a monk? What does Tien learn that makes him turn around? And, if he learned it, why does he go from monk to monkey and literally bite a hunk out of a guy's neck in the final fight? What caused the 'instant replay/do over'? It's hard to take Ong Bak 3 seriously or become invested in the characters when there's little clue as to what's driving them or what's at stake for them.

At the end of watching these two movies (total running time of three hours), I felt like there was definitely a good Tony Jaa flick buried in there somewhere. However, it's lost in a mix-master script of ridiculous and overwrought plots/subplots and a lack of logical flow that would give the story elements coherence. The movie takes itself far too seriously and, while some of the fight scenes are good, others are sub par and the use of wire-fu is truly disappointing. Despite the obvious potential and panache used to film these movies, they fall far short of being enjoyable on just about any level and come off as pretentious, dull, and ridiculous.

Hopefully this is just a slip-up for Jaa and his next offering will be tighter and more focused. He's too good of a performer to throw in the towel!",1310774400,5,4754,4.4901734104046245
4321071,4,B004BZ5AM8,"I thought it was a decent/good movie overall.  Some parts were totally ridiculous and I couldn't piece together a couple of details/was a bit confused.  Some parts were great.  I love when they devote a couple of minutes to just showing him doing his Muay Thai moves (like minutes into the start of Ong Bak 1 and about 57 minutes into Ong Bak 3): both impressive skill-wise, and delicious visually.  Although this version was not exactly action packed, it did have enough action for me (I like lots of action in such movies...preferably around every corner).  It did seem like the action scenes were more...fake-looking than in the other movies of his that I've seen.
I only recently learned of the name Tony Jaa, but in a moment, I was a fan.  I have seen all 3 Ong Bak movies, and The Protector.  I recommend The Protector if you liked Ong Bak 1 (they both have a few dumb/silly incidents and lots of action).
I rate the movies as follows:

1st place: Ong Bak 1 and The Protector (I didn't love how - for the most part - Ong Bak made the city people out to be bad, without morals, ruled by money and the rural people out to be good, giving, making risky decisions only for the sake of their God...and how naive Tien was.  Ip Man (doesnt feature Jaa) was a great movie as well!

2nd: Ong Bak 3 (at the end of the movie, was it him thrusting that stick down that somehow caused lightning or was it ""the Gods""?  The magical/spiritual part at the end was a bit cool and enchanting, but also a bit of a turn off since I leave my movie-trance when something utterly impossible or stupid happens.  Surprisingly, I found the crazy/mentally-ill guy pretty entertaining.  Unlike another reviewer, I didn't feel too jaded by his recovery process.  I felt he progressed at a decent enough pace for the movie and I'm sure that the person who said he was ""whining"" about his disability would have handled being beaten up, losing loved ones, and losing one of the main skills/things that made them feel valuable as a person - much better than he handled it).

3rd: Ong Bak 2 (why wasn't ""The Beginning"" Ong Bak 1?? lol  Oh, and the jumping back and forward in time annoyed me a bit.  I was also uncertain as to whether Ong Bak 2 incidents occurred prior to the stuff in 1..but I guess not.  I think this is the one where he does the bird dance in front of the King.  Am I the only one who thought, for just a second, that the dangling cloth at the end of the woman's dance was her leg?  I was like ""What's wrong with her foot??"").

It seems that all of these movies have poor/scant character developement, so it's harder for me to really get into it, other than loving to watch him do Martial Arts.  Make sure you all search hard before buying movies (not that I don't love Amazon)...you can find almost any title somewhere online for free, but sometimes without subtitles.",1309046400,,2860,4.397338403041825
4321072,1,B004BZ5AM8,"When I watched Ong Bak, I was captivated by the storyline and the martial arts. It even ended well. Then to know a sequel was coming out, I was excited and watched that too. That ended with a cliffhanger that leads us up to this one... part 3.

If I had to compare this movie to anything it would end up being the 3rd movie in the Matrix trilogy. It's a trilogy that started off strong, had a decent sequel then one heck of a sucky 3rd outting. This one is just that.

The storyline takes a back seat to religious fluff and the martial arts sequences (when you can even find any) are bland and boring.

This movie is a bad aftertaste to an otherwise great storyline. Only watch it if you want see something beyond what the first two movies offered for action and storyline.",1307059200,,773,4.244897959183674

The epic fight that I was waiting for between him and the crow was not impressive at all.

The first sequence is so far over the top and unrealistic I wanted to drop a hatchet elbow through my tv. I've been a martial arts enthusiast for as long as I can remember an appreciate just about anything they can bring to the screen but, this did it in for me. So after he's beaten to a literal pulp after 15min. or so (we're talking a full swinging battering ram repeatedly striking his skull) the movie deviates on some over dramatic flashback tangent of love, weird camera angles, odd dialogue, and facial expressions. This goes on for 1hr. 15min. By this point you're hoping by some director's epiphany that a jaw dropping fight scene breaks out. Which it does. Unfortunately, it's during the last 8min. of the movie and then the credits roll. It was like the original movie made so much money and was completely awesome that they tried and made a decent 2nd, which has no relation to the 1st, then tried to finish with a crescendo of a 3rd movie and ended up with a mildly-retar*ded little kid playing a kazzoo instead.

Part of that may be cultural perspective, but I don't remember having difficulties with the first two...

Tony Jaa films are about action anyway and this lets down there as well.  The fights aren't as intense or as frequent as the second movie and Tony just doesn't look as impressive in this.  I came away from this feeling like he's on the decline, like he's getting old; Jackie Chan syndrom if you will.  Hopefully that's not the case.",1300320000,5,678,4.384
4321091,4,B004BZ5AM8,"I saw the first Ong Bak before and though I liked it I was not overly impressed with it, so I wasn't expecting to like this film as much as I did. But this movie had not only great action and fight scenes, but also a very well done story that involved Buddhism and mystical elements. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5-stars is that some of the sets were painfully obviously fake, which was in stark contrast to the vividness of the movie at other times. But this is to be expected with a low-to-medium budget film and I'd rather have a film like this that emphasizes the story and action over just some polished shallow Hollywood blockbuster. Also, while I liked the story, it isn't exactly treading any new ground per say - it's your typical good v. evil with a side of revenge martial arts film. But the way it is presented with alternative cycles of time is unique and probably caused confusion for many that don't understand Buddhist concepts. The soundtrack was also very good with some great musical scores at seemingly just the right time.

I thought the ending which showed two possible outcomes was a really nice twist. The reason why some people don't ""get"" the story is that they don't understand Buddhism well enough to comprehend what is going on. You must understand that the storyline is taking place in different lives - Buddhism believes in reincarnation and in circular cycles of life. If you are hung up on linear reality like most people are in the West, then it will seem confusing to you.

So if you enjoyed the first two, chances are you're going to find something to like about the third film. It concludes the 2nd movie flawlessly, with great scenes by both of the leads, Tony and Dan. This movie is the final chapter and is about the evolution of the main character. Tony Jaa's character really comes into his own and perfects his style really making it his own. The first film is all Muay Thai, the second is all about the weapons, and the third film is about the mental side of fighting and about discovering his own true style. The first two films are more fast paced and brutal,because Tony's character is more savage and not as precise yet in his fighting style. In the third Tony's style is a lot more graceful and technical. However, Dan's fight scenes are very brutal because as the villain he can get away with a bit more, and his scenes really deliver and shine. There is more story in the 3rd film but it makes the final fight scene that much better because you actually care about the character. American action films and martial arts films as of late can't compete with true art. This movie has just as much substance as style. You probably should watch the 2nd one before you watch the third though, considering its basically one long movie in two parts. Highly recommended.",1299283200,5,1503,4.489051094890511
4321097,1,B004BZ5AM8,"If I can give a rating of NEGATIVE 5 star, I would. This movie is beyond terrible. I have not watched the the previous 2 Ong Bak movies, and judging by this one, I can't see how much better the previous twos can be. This movie is almost like an unintentional comedy.

First, the story is terrible. The movie is very slow. The first hour of the movie is just wasting time. We all know the reason to watch it is because it's a Thai martial arts movie. Therefore, I can accept a terrible script if there were plenty of good fighting scenes. Unfortunately, there isn't any. The final fighting scene is slow and unimaginative.

People are comparing the main actor, Tony Jaa, to Jacky Chan and Jet Li. Well, that is an insult to Jacky Chan and Jet Li. Jacky Chan's movies are like street-fighting style, while Jet Li's movies are more classic martial arts style. Tony Jaa is neither. The speed of the fighting action is really no comparison.

To me, the best of classic martial art movies are Jet Li's ""Once Upon a Time in China"" collection (the first one is the best) and ""Fist of Legend"", although his first movie ""Shaolin Temple"" is also very good, and Donnie Yan's IP Man collection (1 and 2). If you enjoy street-fighting style, then you will like many of Jacky Chan's movies. Watch those, and you will see how inferior Tony Jaa really is.",1299196800,,1338,4.453061224489796

Yes, it is very philosophical and artsy (like 2).  And yes, it has some of the best martial arts sequences and stunts in film history (like 2).  They used herds of actual elephants!  No wires, not even for the stunt men or villains; all real.

For those who missed the plot...In Ong Bak 2 and the first half of 3, Tien is still in the world of desires and suffering (mainly for vengeance).  As 3 progresses, he becomes enlightened and at peace.  This is reflected in his fighting style, which becomes more calm and fluid (which is a mix between martial arts and dance movements).  Demon Crow represents exactly what you'd think, and yes that fight scene which ends with the spear was all in his head.  It is intended to represent the futility (although awesomely done) of rage and desires in contrast to the purpose and effectiveness (maybe a little cheesy for a minute, I'll admit) of enlightenment and harmony.  All in all, a bold vision and a difficult film to make (and sell as it isn't exactly a popcorn film).  I applaud Jaa on not just making another run of the mill martial arts film, and can't wait for him to back in the saddle.

Don't go by the negative reviews.  Ong Bak 2 and 3 could only have been made by Tony Jaa, no one else has that skill.  Anyone who said he disappoints missed some incredible stuff.

4321100,3,B004BZ5AM8,"Ong Bak 3 begins where Ong Bak 2 left off (however, Ong Bak is totally unrelated to either sequel).  To be honest, I am an ardent lover of all things martial arts; I watch the UFC routinely, I am a practitioner of tae kwon do and karate, and I love Tony Jaa and his movies.  For someone like me, it is rather easy to spend hours watching one of his movies, slowing it down and replaying it in order to understand every nuance of his brilliant technique.  Needless to say, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Ong Bak 3.

After I watched it, however, I was filled with a hollow disappointment.  To start with, there was practically no plot.  To summarize the movie, Jaa's character is tortured, he escapes and recovers, and returns for revenge.  That's it.  I understand that movies such as this are not renowned for their complex storylines filled with brilliant twists and turns.  But Ong Bak 3 has a plot that falls well short of Tony Jaa's previous movies.  It seems to me that Ong Bak 2 exhausted Jaa, and that he viewed the third as more of a chore.  Sure, the fight sequences were fantastic.  But at this point, that's pretty much a given.

The action was few and far between, relatively speaking.  More often, I found myself watching arcane rituals filled with darkness and tendrils of smoke.  Martial arts definitely have a spiritual side to them.  But this movie took it too far.  In his previous movies, Tony's character (as well as his adversaries) is capable of nearly superhuman feats.  But never magic.  That's right.  Now there is defying gravity, decapitating with a single finger, controlling the sun, and even reversing time.

Overall, I was very disappointed in this movie.  It seems as if the makers felt a need to top Ong Bak 2, which resulted in a far less enjoyable experience.  I recommend that any lover of Tony Jaa purchase this movie, but brace yourself and do not expect to be blown away, because it does not compare to his previous films.",1298073600,2,1965,4.535612535612535

But is it too early to indulge in a segue? As I track this story arc, call me crazy but I'm reminded, tenuously, of that classic ""Tae Kwon Leep"" skit in which abrasive student Ed Gruberman insists on learning how to beat up on guys but right now, even as the serene martial arts master preaches meditation. One of ONG BAK 3's conceits is that Tony Jaa's character, Tien, exists under some sort of dark karma which dictates that crap must always befall him. This movie then chronicles Tien's attainment of inner peace and enlightenment. Of course, this doesn't mean Tien can't vigorously boot to the head anymore.

The story, set in 15th century Thailand, opens with the requisite filler flashbacks from ONG BAK 2 and we view the minions of the local despot, Lord Rajasena, getting their torture on with Tien doubling as the meat piata. When Tien gets a last second reprieve from execution, at this juncture, you may want to get off the couch and run some errands because the next half-hour or so is agonizing. A crippled Tien spends much time recuperating from shattered bones and meditating on the claptraps of Eastern philosophy. It's only interesting when Tien practices the forms of krabi krabong, the precursor to modern-day Muay Thai boxing. The camera veers away from Jaa a bunch of times to focus on the vile Rajasena. Rajasena is tormented by nightmares; he's getting the heebie-jeebies stemming from the curse placed on him years ago by the dying warlord he'd poisoned and supplanted. Passages are also devoted to Tien's dark opposite, that sorcerous crow figure Bhuti Sangkha, and we know this dude is shady because not only does he drink the blood of elephants but he also puts on seriously heavy eyeliner and he's more tattooed than a professional basketball player. Anyway, make sure you're around for the film's last twenty minutes or so, because that's when Jaa starts blessing miscreants with hurtful knees and elbows. That's when he breaks out the elephants for props.

When I saw this film and tweeted that Tony Jaa needed a haircut, I didn't mean that he should become a monk just to shave his head. Seriously, it's a shame that Tony Jaa retired from cinema to join some Buddhist monastery, the pressures of moviemaking just too much for him. His recent track record hasn't been as solid as his fans had hoped. ""One's reach should exceed one's grasp else what's heaven for?"" said some bloke. But Jaa maybe shouldn't have been so ambitious. He tried to make an epic film here, tried to make a philosophical point, but he and his crew just didn't have the tools. As in ONG BAK 2, the narrative is incoherent and leaden, the pace is glacial, and much of it feels like filler. Ultimately ONG BAK 2 & 3 constitute a dreary hero's odyssey. In a picture in which the fight scenes are what people came to see, the belly-button contemplating takes away from the action, not that there was that much action.

Off the top of my noggin, I recall five fight sequences, three of which feature Jaa. The other two: The most forgettable one has the warlord's minions attacking a village harboring the grievously wounded (and comatose) Tien. The crow fighter gets a nifty spotlight fight in which he puts the hurt on one poor thug who ends up sliding down a pole upside down and smashing his skull on a stone slab. Jaa, early in the film, takes on a horde of soldiers. Later, while training, he takes on more soldiers in the woods. Finally, the closing 20 minutes showcase an unleashed Jaa in a series of brutal encounters. When Jaa is in his own element, no one is more raw and riveting. In the climactic moments, Jaa offers up two looks, as an enraged warrior brutalizing his opponents and as a fighter at peace utilizing minimal movements to effortlessly deflect the bad guys' assault. The moral we take away from this film: Aggressive knees and elbows applied to sundry goons may be more satisfying, but zen enlightenment is the discipline to channel if you don't want to sweat too much. On the other hand, to see Tony Jaa doing his pachyderm walk and stomp is to explode out of your seat bellowing a choice bit of profanity. No one can open a can like this man. Jaa still has no truck with wires, still performs his own stunts, still stages the most dynamic full contact disputes. Crazy acrobatics, pulverizing knee drops, sledgehammer elbow strikes... the only thing missing is acting chops. Like ONG BAK 2, see this one for the fight scenes.

This single DVD's bonus material includes the ""HDNet Look at ONG BAK 3"" as two-time World Full-Contact Karate Champion and two-time World Kickboxing Champion Guy Mezger comments on Tony Jaa's martial arts style in ONG BAK 3 (00:03:09 minutes long) and also the theatrical trailer.",1297555200,2,4894,4.687209302325582

Alot of viewers were disappointed with this last chapter but I just think alot of people didn't understand or appreciate true art in film. ""Ong Bak 2"" & ""Ong Bak 3"" are masterpieces for Jaa. I love the epic and ""period"" style and storytelling and he just makes martial arts truly look like ""Art"" and ""Dance""!

Jaa is truly one of the best!! I hope he will do more after his time as a Monk ends...",1297555200,3,475,4.053191489361702

The action sequences are horrible compared to Ong Bak2 and The Protector.  Ong Bak2 and The Protector are two of my favorite martial arts movies. As for Ong Bak 3 the story line is boring and Tien spends half the movie recovering from his injuries from the last movie.

The video quality is great and the audio is great as well. However the movie itself was junk. Don't buy it. If you must watch it, then rent it. To think I could have got two months of Netflix for the price of this movie instead of buying Ong Bak 3.",1297555200,2,636,4.24793388429752

Jaa, if you're reading this, big respect to you and your stunt crew! next time, come up with a great story and let someone else direct, for now... you do what you do best and show us killer muay thai! rock on...",1297382400,,632,4.146341463414634
4321110,3,B004BZ5AM8,"The Jaaman is back in a solid entry in the Ong Bak saga.  Another beautiful looking film that shows the softer side of his character.  While not as amazing as OB1 or OB2 it still has some great fight scenes.  The fights are more dance this time around but there's no doubt Jaa is still king.  It does slow down during the middle as he goes into Zen mode.  They really could have trimmed the length to tighten up the film.  The cast is great but there's not a lot for them to do in this one.  I hope that Jaa spends more time in front of the camera for his next film.  There's plenty of time for him to direct in the future.  If you're not a fan of OB2 then you may want to rent this one before you buy.  This is my third favorite of the Ong Bak films.

4321111,2,B004BZ5AM8,"I have been a fan of the original Ong-Bak for some time. I imported the original before a US release and find it to be one of my favorite martial arts movies period. I was very excited for this movie to come out even though Ong-Bak 2 was a major departure from the original. The fight scenes were great and entertaining but they definitely lacked the raw feel of the original. Some of the stuff done here cannot be faked and that's it what I loved about the original.

The big downfall to me is that the cultural differences between Thai and the US are dramatic in this movie. I was so confused by things that were going on and did not understand how certain scenes related to the movie. I found myself fast forwarding to skip through long drawn out scenes. I can't really say that I would watch this movie all the way through again. I may show some people some of the fight scenes though.",1297209600,,889,4.291666666666667
4321112,4,B004BZ5AM8,"Ong Bak 3  is a  visually stunning  movie. I won't bore you with the plot or story line, other than to say is it time for Tien to get revenge for the death of his father.

This is a movie of extremes. It flops in some places and in other places, it sores to heights never before seen in this genre. But what does work,  is Tony Jaa's mixing and matching of mysticism, Buddhism, spiritualism, and kick ass kick boxing. That along with the stunning visualizations takes this movie way beyond the normal realm of a normal martial arts movie.

Tony Jaa as a director, is very interesting to say the least. He experiments with a non linear story line, and for the most part, it is a bit confusing.  Jaa uses flash backs and dream sequences, and sometimes it falls flat, too.

On the other hand, Tony Jaa sets new standards for Thai movie making. Being a country boy from Surin, Tony demonstrates a true understanding of rural Thai culture, and it appears he deeply respects it. In fact, this movie is laced with subtle profundities, which for the most part, will high fly high over the head of the average kick boxing fan.

As a director, Tony takes many chances - some of it works well,  and then again, some of it fails badly. Tony throws caution to the wind.  He is bold and vibrant when it comes to casting - this works extremely well, giving this period piece a feel of authenticity. Even better, Jaa's old comic side kick from Ong Bag 1, plays a dim wit in this movie. He provides us with occasional lighthearted laughs.

And as expected, Tony is strong when it comes to fighting  and weaponry.  Ong Bak 3 is loaded down with jaw dropping stunts. So much so, you almost get used to it.  And unexpectedly, Tony Jaa shows he is actually capable of acting. Even more so, Jaa has a romantic interest in the movie. A major plus for an otherwise lame story line. Too bad, character development is nonexistent in Ong Bak 3. I hope in the future, Tony Jaa, the director will learn to develop a strong story line and do character build up.

Ong Bak 3 is a balancing act of turmoil and peace, dark and light, and good and evil. There is very little gray here. Sometimes the build up doesn't climax as intense as you would like. But at the end of the day, there is only one Tony Jaa.  He is awesome in so many ways, and is more than enough to carry any kick boxing movie. Even the jumbled story line cannot deter Ong Bag 3 from being a spicy  hot mind boggling experience. When it works, it is poetry in motion. And when it doesn't, oh well,  Tony will do  a stunt or two to make you forgive the flaws.",1295136000,19,2592,4.283367556468172

4321115,1,B004BZ5AM8,"I saw this rental since I was a fan of Tony Jaa, but priced at $9.99 you are not getting your money's worth if you are comparing the story telling and action scenes from the first two movies to the last. This movie seemed to have much more graphic violence to make up for the lack of story or action. I think Ong Bak 2 ended fine and part 3 never really needed to be made. This movie picks up with the protagonist being resurrected after being brutally killed and follows with his quest for revenge/retribution. Ong Bak 3 takes on a broader theme of good versus evil. The added mysticism aspect of the movie did not throw me off as so much as its execution in filming. Then again, perhaps I am being overly harsh since it's a Pre-Theatrical release.",1294444800,,749,4.319148936170213

The healing process continues... He's wrapped up like the guy on Kung fu Hustle, but for more than an hour of the movie.  When he finally heals, the action isn't nearly as good as the other 2 Ong Bak movies.  The villain he's waited to kill for his whole life is killed by some demon and it doesn't make sense.  When he fights the demon it isn't that entertaining...  This movie isn't a must see...  It's not enough action...  Save your money...

Spoiler alert!!

Tony Jaa is back as Tien, story continues from ending of Ong Bak2 with the evil Lord Rajasena torturing him by breaking his bones (after Tien has trashed the 20 guards). He is rescued by Kana Khone villagers, to heal Tien's karma the villagers build the Buddha statue seen in the first movie; this causes Tien to be miraculously healed allowing him to rehabilitate his body to complete health. Meanwhile Lord Rajasena is plagued by visions due to betraying his lord and the Ghost Crow (Dan Chupong) offers to remove the curse; of course he kills Rajasena in order to become the new king. Tien arrives with his new found mystical powers, overcomes Ghost Crow and rescues the girl.

But this movie sucks.  I love Ong Bak 2, but 3 is so damn BORING.

Instead of taking the route of the second film, they focus more on supernatural aspects and more on good vs evil, rather than a story of vengeance.  Half the time I was watching I was asking myself ""what the hell is going on"" because the subject matter is so distant from that of the first two films.

85% of the movie Jaa is crippled or recovering from being dead, so there's less fighting and more whining and tantrums about being crippled.  The only decent display of action from Jaa is approximately 10 minutes before the end of the movie, and it's still not his best performance.

I would expect any Tony Jaa fan to watch this and form their own opinion.  This is simply my opinion, and damn was I disappointed.",1291680000,16,878,4.37037037037037

I can see that Tony wanted to tell a story in this one, as it is the final chapter.
