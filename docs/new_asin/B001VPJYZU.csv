3823411,5,B001VPJYZU,This is the best show on tv by far!! Thank you to all the actors for doing such a good job.  I love this show!!,1253145600,,111,3.44
3823412,5,B001VPJYZU,"""Brothers and Sisters"" is a show created back in 2006 by Jon Robin Baitz (a writer who worked on ""Alias"" and ""West Wing"").  The series revolves around the Walker family, an upperclass family that owns business known as Ojai foods.

During the first season of the series, the family is rocked by the death of the father and business owner, William Walker.  But even more shocking to the family is that their father had a mistress and an illegitimate daughter but that William had embezzled money from the company.  So, the family focuses on the lives of the Walker family and how the brothers and sisters must move on with the family business and make sure it is not run into the ground and try to keep it afloat.

There are a total of 24 episodes in season 3 (Episodes 40-63).

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Video is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions.  There are a lot of outdoor and indoor shots and ""Brothers and Sisters"" does have quite a bit of grain but nothing too distracting.  But for the most part, picture quality is satisfactory.

Audio is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, the show is mostly dialogue-based but there are quite a bit of music featured in the episodes, but the audio is pretty much front and center channel driven and audio is clear.  There are no really need for major sound effects for ""Brothers and Sisters"" but for the most part, dialogue and background music are heard quite clearly.  My receiver setup preference was set as ""Stereo on all Channels"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Brothers and Sisters"" definitely had quite a bit of surprising moments for the third season.  For the first half of the season, our attention was focused on the family dynamics with Kitty and Robert focusing on adoption, Saul's sexuality and wanting to come out, Justin and Rebecca's relationship and starting to feel disconnected with the military and of course, Sarah and Tommy trying to keep the business afloat.  While Nora, was being a mother as usual and involved in her family's lives and trying to find out more about Williams other illegitimate child Ryan.

But I guess, what surprised me the most was seeing how Kitty and Robert's marriage had this major change during the second half was a bit of a surprise.  As for the character of Tommy, with rumors on the entertainment gossip blogs that Balthazar Getty was leaving the show, now I'm not sure if Tommy is even going to be a factor in future episodes, let alone seasons.  But the hype around something bad was going to happen with a character in the series definitely made things more exciting and seeing what was going to happen in the ""Troubled Waters"" episodes, but the episode did set the tone for the second half of the season.

As for the DVD, the DVD is a solid release but I did find it interesting that instead of putting the deleted scenes in one disc (since most of them are quite short), they spread them out on all discs.  I wish there were more audio commentary with someone in the Walker family included on the disc but overall, the amount of special features should make fans content with the box set.

Overall, ""Brothers and Sisters"" had a solid third season and definitely it will be interesting to see where the writers take the series for it's fourth.  If you have invested in the previous two seasons, ""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Third Season"" is definitely worth recommending!",1251763200,6,6202,4.697307335190343
3823413,1,B001VPJYZU,"***** Warning! This review contains season three spoilers***************

When Brothers & Sisters first started, I absolutely loved the show. It was one of the TV shows that I looked forward to the most every week, but starting with season two and continuing with season three I feel like the overall quality of the show has been on the steady decline. I feel that this is for the most part due to the writing which at the beginning of the series had a very organic feel to it and the writing for all of the characters for the most part remained constant.

However, by the end of season two and especially all throughout season three, the writing has become more and more contrived and more like a soap opera, especially with the retcon of Rebecca and the introduction of Ryan. Initially, when they revealed that Rebecca wasn't really a Walker after all, I was willing to give the storyline as well as the Justin and Rebecca relationship and the introduction of Ryan a chance. However, I soon found Justin and Rebecca to be one of the most frustrating couples to ever watch on a TV show. Almost all of their storylines involve extremely juvenile fights and breakups followed by hasty reunions. To make matters worse, season three ended with Justin and Rebecca getting engaged after spending most of the season fighting and breaking up every other episode.

I feel like the writers of the show have become completely detached from their audience because it's clear that they no longer care about how the majority of the viewers feel about the storylines, they're just going to tell the storylines that they want to tell even if it causes them to alienate and lose viewers in the process. I know full well that this is the case with a lot of the viewer because I belong to a Brothers & Sisters forum and the majority of the members on the boards feel the same way about the show.

I feel like almost all of the members of the Walker family have become props for Holly, Rebecca and Robert's storylines. If you ask me, the producers might as well rename the show The Harpers & Robert McCallister because the show is supposed to be about the Walkers, but season three devoted a lot of screen time to Holly, Rebecca, Robert and David too when they aren't even Walkers.

I have to admit that when Luke Grimes first came on the show as Ryan, I really liked Ryan and was fascinated by him, but Ryan soon became a very creepy person to watch with Rebecca obsession, his quest for revenge against the Walkers for the death of his mother and his stalkerish tendencies. Initially, I felt like Ryan was being portrayed as what the writers had originally planned on Rebecca being before they changed their minds, ""the major troublemaker"", but they very soon screwed that up because Ryan is now just too painfully creepy to watch. This whole situation with Ryan has recently been made worse with the announcement that Luke Grimes has been made a series regular.

Kevin and the Kevin & Scotty relationship have always been one of my favorite things about the show, but this season I felt like the Kevin & Scotty relationship weren't give an equal amount of screen time compared to all of the other couples on the show. They definitely had some great moments this season, but by the end of the season I was left wanting more and not in a good way. I also absolutely hated the whole thing with Kevin quitting his job as a lawyer and going to work for Robert because it made Kevin become a shell of his former self and led to many WTF moments with Kevin that made no sense at all. In theory, this storyline had a lot of potential to be really entertaining given the tension that's existed between Kevin and Robert in the past, but in the end the writing of the storyline was handled poorly and Kevin simply became a prop to be used in Robert's storylines. That being said, I still loved Kevin this season but only when his storylines for the episodes didn't involve Robert and he was interacting with the other characters, especially Scotty and Sarah. Also, I hate Robert. He's so self-righteous and the writers haven't ever made him flawed enough for my taste. Every time Robert makes a mistake, the consequences of his actions rarely stick or have any long-term impact on his relationships with the other characters and he always comes out smelling like a rose.

I also found myself loving Nora and Sarah's storylines this season. I've always loved the characters Nora, especially since Sally Field has been my favorite actress since I was about six years-old and her being in the cast was what made decide to watch the show when it started. I've always loved Sarah too, but I absolutely loved Sarah in season three. Nora, Sarah, Kevin and Scotty were definitely the few saving graces of season three for me.

All of this being said, I for the most part hated season three and I won't be buying the Brothers & Sisters season three DVD set.  I plan on watching the season four premiere in its entirety, and if doesn't really wow me in any major way, I will just record the episodes on my DVR without watching it live and then just watch only the scenes with Kevin, Scotty, Nora and Sarah for every episode after that because they are the only reason that I'm still watching the show at this point. Brothers & Sisters has definitely lost the magic that it once had when the show first started  and has almost completely lost me as a viewer.",1250899200,22,5420,4.561151079136691
3823414,5,B001VPJYZU,"The accolades might always go to Sally Field and Rachel Griffiths (both terrific).

But in the third season of the series, Calista Flockhart goes deep and gives the most nuanced performance of the year. She deserved an Emmy for this season (and they snubbed her). The third season had it's share of mistakes, but Flockhart was a joy to watch. It's so good to have her back on television.",1248048000,6,387,4.608695652173913
3823415,5,B001VPJYZU,BEST SHOW ON TV...HAS ALL THAT YOU WANT AND THE ACTING IS GREAT AND GOD LOVE SALLY FIELD SHE IS BACK AND GREAT. THE WHOLE CAST IS..  LOVE THIS SHOW.. LOOK FOR A FEW MORE YEARS AND MORE TAPES OF THIS SHOW.,1246838400,3,204,3.857142857142857
3823416,4,B001VPJYZU,"BROTHERS AND SISTERS has continued through its three seasons to be a consistently interesting series, but also one that has rarely truly surprised me.  The vast majority of episodes has something of the feel of a formula to them.  In fact, the writers have obviously become so aware of the formula that they even verged on the edge of self-parody.  The forumla is familiar to anyone who has watched the show:  one member of the Walker family confesses a secret to another member.  Somehow or other the possessor of the secret leaks it to another or someone guesses the secret.  Within seconds 6 or 7 or 8 people know what was supposed to be an exclusive secret between just two.  Once a show gets to the point where they begin to parody themselves on this, you can guess that as a device that it has become overused.  And that was certainly the case on BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

I have to confess that this is a show that I've often been conflicted over.  On the one hand, it is a character-based serial drama, which is far and away my favorite kind of TV series.  All my absolutely favorite shows, like BUFFY and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS and VERONICA MARS and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, have been character-based serial dramas.  And my complaint about many shows is that they either are not sufficiently character-based (the STARGATES and many other Sci-fi shows, for instance) or not sufficiently serial (my main complaint with GOSSIP GIRL in its second season, in which its story arcs shrank to two to three episodes).  So in theory BROTHERS AND SISTERS should be my kind of show.  Furthermore, the show has an excellent cast.  Many cite Sally Field as a favorite, though I have to say that her character quickly gets on my nerves.  In fact, this is the case with many of the characters on the show.  I love Rachel Griffiths, but I'm not terribly attached to her character Sarah.  Ditto Matthew Rhys, who is a very fine actor, but whose character Kevin has always struck me as far too gruff to be especially likable.  (On the other hand, in debates on boards about which actors on TV from England or Australia or similar countries have the best American accents, I often argue that Griffiths and Rhys have the best adopted accents on TV.)  If Kevin is too gruff, I find Balthazar Getty's Tommy to be too grumpy.  And Dave Annable's Justin is too sensitive.  And Calista Flockhart's Kitty is just too spineless.  And so on and so forth.  And Patricia Wettig's Holly Harper is one of my least favorite characters on TV.  In short, I just dislike many of the characters.  So while the show is a character-based serial, I find that I just don't care about the development of the characters.  I do like Emily VanCamp's Rebecca (and I hope that she remains the good person that she has been shown to be in the first three seasons -- I like putting characters through the wringer, but not by crushing their moral backbone) and love Ron Rifkin's Saul, who has always to my mind been an underutilized character.  I vaguely enjoy each episode of the show, though at the same time I'm aware that I don't much care what happens to any of the character (except Rebecca and Saul).

So, on the one hand I respect the format of this show and like that we see characters change and evolve over time.  On the other hand, these are far from my favorite group of characters on TV and I find many of the individual episodes quite formulaic.  Contrast this with a show like FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, where I both love the format and adore the characters.  Another interesting contrast is GOSSIP GIRL, where I like the characters more than those on BROTHERS AND SISTERS, but increasingly dislike the format of the show (I'm convinced that the CW imagines that if GOSSIP GIRL maintains story arcs that last more than a couple of episodes, the viewers will find the show too challenging and will abandon it -- which would be strange given that GG is in fact a very low rated show with fewer viewers than any ""buzzworthy"" show on TV -- if they lengthened the story arcs they might actually attract more mature viewers).  I'll probably continue to watch BROTHERS AND SISTERS in Season Four.  But it definitely is not must-see TV for me and if the time came when I felt that I had to give up a show or two in order to find time for other things, it would be one of the first shows I would think about sacrificing.",1245628800,4,4370,4.531887755102041

3823478,5,B001VPJYZU,A great series about a mother and his 5 adult and totally different children.  A series that promotes family union trough the toughest times.,1294099200,,141,4.875
3823479,4,B001VPJYZU,"I have followed Brothers & Sisters on TV from the first episode in 2006.  The Walker family became my family.  When they released the first season on DVD I immediately purchased it - also season two and season three.  This third go-round has become slightly contrived and overly dramatic. Sally Field is still my favorite actress in the series.  Most of the other actors and actresses are excellent - except the plot ideas which they're given to act out.  We have a lot of bickering and then ""I'm sorry"" for most of the episodes.  I'm hoping when I buy the fourth season of B & S the cast will get back to being at least a little bit normal. I have written several scripts for TV and realize it's tough trying to keep an audience satisfied season after season.",1291420800,2,760,4.431654676258993
3823480,5,B001VPJYZU,"DVD - Brothers and Sisters, the third season is a great TV series. I loved it. The product I received is excellent and was received when promised.",1287964800,,146,4.444444444444445
3823481,5,B001VPJYZU,"Have watched and enjoyed the entire third season.

These episodes, as well as the 1st and 2nd seasons, are keepers.

We'll enjoy them again later!",1287100800,2,148,4.518518518518518
3823482,4,B001VPJYZU,"Really enjoyed seasons 1 & 2 now enjoying season 3.  If I am not careful I could sit and watch three or four episodes in one sitting.  I want to space them out, however, to make the experience last till I buy season 4 in August.",1275609600,,228,3.9347826086956523
3823483,5,B001VPJYZU,"Absolutely fantastic.  The cast works so well together both in drama and humor, and the mishaps along the way remind me (a poorer version) of my own family...sort of.  Well done - five stars to cast and crew!",1268438400,,208,4.447368421052632
3823484,5,B001VPJYZU,"As I was snowed in by the Blizzard of 2010 in Washington DC, I was able to avoid cabin fever by watching this clever, entertaining family saga.  I pretended that I was in California with the Walkers.",1266105600,,199,4.378378378378378
3823485,5,B001VPJYZU,"I love buying from Amazon it's always safe and secure and even though I live in Australia I always get my DVD's before they are supposed to arrive, we love Brother's and Sister's and all DVD's are in tact and can be watched.

3823488,3,B001VPJYZU,"I watch and enjoy Brothers and Sisters, although its really just a superficial soap opera about the trials and tribulations of wealthy California family.  I recognize that this is not great drama.  However, as a gay man, I had to laugh at the episode where there was a wedding shower for one of the female characters.  In attendance were the all of the women and the four gay male characters.  None of the straight male characters attended.  Where did the writers get the idea that gay men attend women's wedding showers?  Talk about a stereotype!",1260144000,,547,4.705263157894737
3823489,5,B001VPJYZU,"When a friend gave me Brothers and  Sisters season one, I wasn't sure  I wanted to see it.  I felt I had had enough of Calista Flockhart. . .  I am glad I saw it,  because Kitty  gets better  and better, and  I can not think of anyone better for the role of Nora -the Matriarch of the Walker family-  as  Sally Field.  Rachel Griffiths, is incredible as Sara,  the oldest of the sibilings of this colorful, yet  ""normal""  family.  After every episode I think of all the writers who put all the characters so well  together.  Last but not least, Rob Lowe is superb as the ex-presidential nominee.  Please don't even think of  giving him another heart attack. . .
keep him very healthy for the pleasure  of all  us women who live far away from the USA and have to rely on DVDs to see our favorite actors.  Marina Mori",1259539200,2,815,4.223684210526316

3823491,5,B001VPJYZU,"My sweetheart and I LOVE this show.  We can't always watch on Sunday nights so we wait for the end of the season and buy the DVD!  Then we pick a weekend and watch all that season's episodes!  It's wonderful!  The writers, producers, and talented actors make this series a joy to watch.",1258329600,,286,4.339622641509434
3823492,4,B001VPJYZU,Sorry cannot give a personal opinion but my friend enjoyed the 3rd Season of Brothers & Sisters,1257120000,,95,4.647058823529412
3823493,5,B001VPJYZU,"This show is great, and I think that that the season 3 DVD set is excellent.  The commentary is great, and while I really enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, I think that season 3 really lured me in.

However -- if you are just watching the shows on DVD (not re-watching) -- do NOT watch the ABC Brothers and Sisters tool kit that appears on disc 1.  It has season 3 spoilers!!

I am upset with ABC for including this on the DVD for those of us who haven't watched that season yet.  I thought it would just remind me about seasons 1 & 2.

Anyway--still gotta give it 5 stars for the fun clever real-life show.",1256256000,,598,4.068376068376068

3823495,5,B001VPJYZU,At first i was very reluctant to order Brothers and Sisters season 4 from Amizon because i did not know if i will recieve it here in saudi Arabia: Riyadh.

Please can we have Brothers and Sisters season 4 to order now.,1254787200,,338,4.059701492537314

3823497,3,B001VPJYZU,"In my opinion, the series are good, but the story needs a twist, or intrigue. For me it was slightly dull and very predictable.",1254441600,,127,4.333333333333333
3823498,5,B001VPJYZU,"Brothers & Sisters is one of the best dramas on TV. I rank it along side Mad Men and Damages. It is emotional, funny and always interesting. The ensemble cast is pitch perfect.",1253318400,,176,4.363636363636363
