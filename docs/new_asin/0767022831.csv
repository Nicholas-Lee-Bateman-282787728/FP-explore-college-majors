8162420,4,0767022831,"This film was one of the best I have ever seen. Like most documentaries, it will explain the truth much more thoroughly than will a normal Hollywood motion picture. The horror of the second world war is struck true in this film. It covers the bombing of Normandy like no other documentary I have found. This will be a film I will watch over and over again. I encourage you to purchase it and make it a part of your video library.",969753600,5,429,4.2439024390243905
