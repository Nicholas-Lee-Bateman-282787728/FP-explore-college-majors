8500583,4,B006M69PDO,"OK typically goofy early 60's Italian-made English-dubbed sword-and-sandal film.  This particular son of Herc, named Maxus, is a wandering hero who aids a fur-wearing, sun-worshipping, tent-dwelling bunch of stone-agers who are beset by dinos and fur-wearing, moon-worshipping, cave-dwelling stone-agers who like making life difficult for all around them.  The guy playing Herc's son has a bad hair dye job.  More like a hair tie-dye job.  The women wear simply dreadful wigs.  The dinos are the kind that, if these had existed man would have developed much earlier.  The dubbing fails a couple of times and it goes back to it's original Italiano with sub-titles, but it doesn't interrupt the flow of the film.  I bought a DVD-R (pictured below) and the picture and color are excellent.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1428796800,,822,5.174242424242424
8500584,4,B006M69PDO,"This movie is chronologically challenged. First off, it takes place in the Ice Age and stars the Son of Hercules,Maxus. Hercules himself, however, wasn't born until several thousand years later in Ancient Greece. How could his son appear in a movie that takes place thousands of years before he was born? The movie never answers that question and frankly, has bigger chronological fish to fry, namely, Reg Lewis' haircut. It's an old b-movie axiom, that while technology changes in these movies from that which we experience in the present, hairstyles will always remain constant to the time period in which the movie was made. In other words, the Son of Hercules sports and Elvis haircut, or what my mom would call a ""Duck's @ss"". And it works, for this type of film. It's just the type of anomally that makes these movies amusing. And Reg himself makes an intersting hero. He is a rather easy going avenger, and with that hair I kept expecting him to break out into a rambling, rockin' rockabilly tune all the time. He plays Maxus a little like you think Elvis would have, and if he would have pushed the Elvis bit a little harder, we'd have a bona fide classic on our hands. Mr. Lewis is sufficently beefy to make a convincing if low-key Hercules.

  Basically there are two tribes in this part of the world, the good Sun tribe and the rotten Moon tribe. Maxus befriends the good tribe by saving their crown prince from a water dragon. He hurtles a spear about 200 yards and nails it right in the eye. He then waves and quickly departs, because he never knows where he'll be needed next. This leaves our prince Idar, to romance his harpy of a girl friend, a babe that looks a bit like Ann Margaret. I couldn't really make out her name, but I think it was Brian(?) Brian pesters Idar, who just wants to spear fish, until he marries her in a ceremony where she promises to raise his children and skin his catch.(Is that a euphemism?) Furthermore, if she fails to obey him, Idar can have her put to death. Both seem content with this arrangement. Ah the good old days. As soon as (And I mean this literally) they finish the vows, the evil Moon tribe attacks! There is some pretty good fighting and the bad guys make off with the good guy's women.

  After this it's pretty by the numbers. The good guys find Maxus wandering around the woods and recruit him to their cause. There are some good fights, Maxus gets buried up to his neck in the earth and is then freed by an earthquake, and a few more papier mache monstrosities are ferociously dispatched by the hero. Somewhere along the way another hottie named Moa or Mona joins Maxus' team and of course the two eventually ride off together. And yes, Maxus has the shiniest pecs I've ever seen. They are shiny on mountaintops,in caves, even underwater. Not a bad Herc movie at all, and the theme song is kinda catchy and fun. I wonder if there's a way I can make a ring tone out of it.",1286409600,,2935,4.4664179104477615
