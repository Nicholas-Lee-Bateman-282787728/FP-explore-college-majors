1650597,5,B00005QW6Q,"This is the one I've been looking for! Disregard the cover. I don't know why the cover is different from the cartoon.  But this is the one! It's the japanese anime of the LIttle Mermaid.

I remember watching this on vhs when I was a small girl.  I remember loving the movie then and after 20 plus years, I still love it!!!!!!

Of course the quality is poorer than the cartoons you watch now but it's not that bad!  The quality will not discourage you from watching it.

It still made me cry! But the story is really really good. I loved it!",1170201600,2,540,4.194174757281553
1650598,5,B00005QW6Q,"Wonderful movie that is totally appropriate for young children. This movie does not dress up life to be something it isn't, perfect. It is a beautiful story of one's sacrifice for the happiness of the one they love. The little mermaid knew that the prince's happiness meant more to her than her own happiness. This is a true life lesson that a child should learn, not the dressed up perfection that cartoons are now. Definately worth the money. Adults and children alike will love this movie.",1169424000,2,492,4.732558139534884
1650599,4,B00005QW6Q,"I would love to give this film a 5 star rating, it's very nostalgic for me, but in fairness to writing an unbias review I will give it a 4. Honestly, it would probably bore most children nowadays, the animation is very poor, the story jumps around a tid bit, the characters aren't well developed, and there isn't too much action. Don't get me wrong, as I said before I love this movie, but compared to todays children's films (Cars, Ice Age, Monster House, and the array of animal movies pixar continues to pump out) this one will probably not hold your kids attention for too long. What makes this movie great though is that it is unique. It actually has a moral, and a very good one at that, and that is what the entire movie is centered around. The moral is love, not the cheesy, prince slays the dragon wins the heart of the princess rubbish, but true love. Most people will find this movie to be cruel and/or sad, because at the end of the movie the mermaid does die, and it does seem unfair. But, again, it is the point of the movie, love isn't always fair, and it is when you are faced with sacrifice that shows just how deeply you love something. It may sound ridiculous to some people, and a lot of them will say that because of the sacrifices the mermaid endures it isn't a good movie for kids, but I disagree. The story was meant to show children the act of being selfless, and maintaining unconditional love for someone (not desperation to be with them), and I think it does a very good job of that. It's really nice to see something like that in a children's movie, something that will teach them something about life, instead filling their head with junk and melting their brains with repetative plots, like I feel many of our more modern movies do. Personally, if I were a parent this would be on the top of the list of movies my kids watched.

So, all in all. I would recommend this movie. Just be warned, if your getting it just to shut your kids up, you're better off with pixar. If you want to get them a movie that actually has a point and will leave an impression on them (not negative as many will make it out to seem) this is your ticket.",1169337600,3,2161,4.28361858190709
1650600,3,B00005QW6Q,"This cartoon really brings out the spirit of the story, which is a very sad one. however i think it should be a PG for that reason. The story is FULL of negative symbolism that might sink into a kid's subconscious and teach them frightning things about life.

for example- the mermaid (Marina) is forced to make sacrifice after sacrifice in order to attain happiness and the chances of her reaching her goal seem unreachable. after horrifying sacrifices, something always comes up and she is no closer to getting what she wants. it gives the impression that the world is much too large and rarely responds to you, and that its a dangerous gamble to do what it takes if you want something.

what's worse, is that it gives the message that in order to be loved, a girl has to foresake her entire support group: her family, friends, her world, all she knows, and even parts of her body. and if she goes in too deep and needs to break away from him, she has to kill either herself or the one she loves :) a very dark vision of the world. and a very cruel one especially to little girls- as it is only the mermaid and her sisters that make sacrifices.. the prince, however, is blissfully unaware of anything and needs to do nothing. He only mourns the loss of the dead mermaid- but his world doesnt end from it. only Marina loses and turns into foam.

there's a very dark message in this cartoon- one that frightens. Especially since lots of little girls like to identify themselves with characters like the mermaid, or a princess. In *this* story, it *is* the girl who must give away vital parts of herself (physical parts and non-physical), or else fade and/or die -if she wants to be loved- and the impact of such ideas cant be positive. However as a piece of litterature, i find it quite deep and the cartoon remains faithful enough to the story. only it doesnt break the message gently enough to kids: that life *can* be scary and painful.",1152662400,5,1939,4.456338028169014
1650601,5,B00005QW6Q,"I just have to say that I have been looking for this specific version of the little mermaid for a few years now.  It has been over 20 years since I saw it!

As a little kid my parents came home one day and said we bought this new invention called a VCR... and what a treat they had thought to get me a movie called the little mermaid.  Obviously this was in the early 80s.  I sat down and watched the movie over and over again until sadly my parents had to return it to the rental store.  While sad, this movie stuck with me for years.  Then I heard Disney was coming out with something called the little mermaid.  I was 10 years old at the time and went in expecting the same movie... that was before I knew that movies are often remade and don't always follow the original storyline.... I remember yelling that this was not the 'real' version to anyone who would listen. Ariel seemed so fake! My friends had mermaid fever while I was just upset with the whole injustice of it all.  I am glad to have the original in my hands again!",1150502400,7,1033,4.13
1650602,3,B00005QW6Q,"Don't let the cover fool you; this film is anything but a sweet kid's film. In fact, while this is a masterpiece of anime drama, I don't think it's very suitable for small children. And no, it's not because of the bra-less mermaids. I'm no prude and couldn't care less about nudity, so long as it's tasteful. It's the traumatic ending and the senseless suffering of the sweet mermaid that get to me. I saw this when I was a small child (despite warnings from my mother and the lady at the video store), and although I loved it at first, the ending disturbed me so much that it gave me nightmares for years afterwards. Even now at 21, I'm not sure I could bear seeing it again. I really can't understand why so many people who love this version are bashing the Disney movie. Sure Disney sugarcoats things, but what's wrong with softening the environment for kids? Can you honestly tell me that you don't let your kids believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy? I also have to admit that I'm a little (okay, very) annoyed by some of the ""my kids love this movie!"" comments. Granted, I loved it too at one point before the damage set in, but now that I know what it is, I can't even fathom a parent who's seen this movie thinking it would be good for children. When a completely innocent young girl is betrayed by the man whom she gave up everything for, she jumps off a ship, dies of a broken heart, and slowly dissolves into foam. Does what I just described sound anything like a children's film? I know that kids need to learn about the real world, but I don't think they need to know all about cruelty and selfishness when they're little. This movie presents both in their worst forms, and I can say from personal experience that kids don't need this sort of scar on their childhood; I carried it for some time, and it's not pleasant. Trust me, kids will be disillusioned soon enough; let them keep their innocence and fairytale endings for now. Keep in mind, I'm not putting down the movie; I just feel compelled to caution parents about its upsetting content, because I don't want kids to be as negatively affected by it as I was. If you're an adult who enjoys a classic and can take a lot of pain, I recommend this film. Just please take care who you share it with.",1143590400,13,2270,4.356132075471698
1650603,5,B00005QW6Q,"I am so excited to have found this version on DVD!!!!  My old VHS copy is about worn out.  My Grandson and I used to watch this together, and though he is 18 now and I am 69, I will still love watching it.  (And hope he will watch with me)  This, in my estimation, is THE ONE VERSION to see.  All others distort the original story.  I have just placed my order, and can hardly wait for this excellent little film to arrive.",1135900800,2,423,3.9761904761904763
1650604,4,B00005QW6Q,"Although the DVD I own is a bootleg from England, I have owned this version as well, and would still own it had it not been glitched. But as for DVD specifics, I can tell you that there are NO bonus features, so don't expect any. There's not even a menu for chapter selection, although there are, I believe, 6 chapters. The print quality leaves a lot to be desired, but for a budget DVD, what can you expect?

However, don't let any of this stop you from buying this WONDERFUL movie on DVD, if you can find a copy in the marketplace, eBay, or even in a store. It's hard to find now. Don't let the tacky cartoony cover art fool you, this IS the 1970's anime-style version of The Little Mermaid featuring a mermaid named Marina and her dolphin friend Fritz, beautifully drawn designs, wonderful 70's soft rock-style music, and the original, darker treatment of the story. Even if you're a fan of Disney's version, please try to pick this up, as it's just as well done, and it's nice to see it told in its original incarnation.",1133481600,6,1024,4.389473684210526
1650605,5,B00005QW6Q,"This is the late 1970's animation from Toi, a Japanese animation house.  One viewing and you'll see just how much it 'inspired' Disney.  Also, don't let the lame cover art fool you.  Why they didn't go with a cell from the animation I'll never know, but this is vintage anime.

The story is not cleaned up like so many other fairy tales have been.  She does, indeed, die in this one.  There is mild nudity, as she doesn't wear a top as a mermaid, though no breasts are seen.  I might be mildly scary for the youngest child, but should fit in fine with your standard princesses.

I searched for this movie for quite some time, and bought it on a whim at a dollar store.  I promptly realized I had indeed found a treasure, and bought a few copies for friends.",1125014400,25,757,4.274647887323944

1650710,3,B00005QW6Q,"Let me just start off by saying that the anime version of this Hans Christian Andersen story is still one of the best adaptations to ever come out and it's a shame that the film doesn't have the same amount of popularity as the Disney version, now with that being said let's get into the actual review. I'll begin by clearing up something that needs addressed the transfer used in this DVD, contrary to popular belief this version is not a transfer of the Starmaker version and is actually a transfer from a UAV VHS tape which can be found here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Mermaid-Hans-Christian-VHS/dp/B00000FDVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Mermaid-Hans Christian [VHS</a>] (Record scratches), wait a minute UAV also released a VHS version of this movie, wasn't Starmaker the only company with the distribution rights for this movie? Well there's actually a funny little story about that, since the Starmaker tapes are the most known release of this movie during the VHS era it would be safe to assume that their version was officially licensed by G.G. Communications (the company that produced the english dub of this movie) right? However that's actually not the case, as it turns out neither Starmaker nor UAV had any distribution rights to the film and their versions were released under the guise of being in the public domain (which I don't know for sure if this movie can actually be considered public domain according to copyright laws), to my knowledge the only version of this movie that was officially licensed by G.G. Communications was in the early 1980's by Video Gems which seems to actually be pretty rare nowadays. Now that I've cleared that up let's talk about the this version of the movie. To start off with there is censorship in this release, any scenes that showed any nudity of the breast regardless of how small it might be was cut (about 2 minutes worth of footage was cut because of this and don't expect the UAV VHS version to be any different because the same edits are also present on that as well) so you can expect the audio to cut abruptly during certain scenes. The animation itself looks great for a 1975 film, the music sounds beautiful especially during the ending which I think I should mention, in this version the mermaid actually dies in a similar fashion to the original story which really sets this one apart from the Disney movie and keeps the message of the original story (so you may want to watch this movie before you let your kids see it and determine if you think it's okay for them to watch it), the only real complaint I had with this movie was the voice acting which to be fully honest sounds too forced and doesn't properly portray the feelings that the characters on screen are showing (the only voice I could say did an excellent job overall was the Sea Witch, everyone else for the most part sounded dull and monotone which really kills great moments in this movie), Other than that I really can't say much more about this DVD it looks and sounds like a censored VHS transferred onto a DVD slapped with a label and sold, however if you can look past its shortcomings and enjoy the movie for what it is I think you'll find an enjoyable experience, but if your a purist who doesn't like anime movies being censored in any way, then you might want to avoid this one and look elsewhere.",1354320000,8,3401,4.79557069846678
1650711,5,B00005QW6Q,Watched this growing up and absolutely loved it. Its nothing like the Disney version and stays true to the book. Dont let the front cover confuse you its not just for children its great for adults too. Its actually great Japanese animation.,1351814400,,240,4.738095238095238
1650712,5,B00005QW6Q,"The cover art of this DVD is, in layman's terms, very misleading. The actual animation within in a plethora of animated beauty, with unique style for the year it was made! While it might not be as dazzling as Disney's version of The Little Mermaid, this older version sticks truer to the tale Hans Christian Anderson gave us, supplying better morals and and all around more insightful and lovely tale. Move out of the way Ariel! This is the Little Mermaid who truly deserved a happy ending.",1346371200,,490,4.64367816091954
1650713,3,B00005QW6Q,"I actually bought this for a 7 year old girl but I don't think I want to give it to her now because the sea witch referred to herself with the big ""B"" word at the very first sentences into the movie. What the heck was that? Who are they trying to sell this DVD to if not for little kids. The story line is kinna boring in the middle so if you wait until when your kids already learn about the B word from somewhere else, they would just simply be too old for it. Maybe they just want to sell to people my age who are just trying to get the DVD with original ending.

Other than that, the quality of images is ok for an old cartoon movie. The audio is not so great but acceptable (again, it's old, what can you do?). The cover is indeed different from the movie but it's not a big deal.",1312502400,,785,3.90625

1650715,5,B00005QW6Q,"I am glad to see this version finally available on DVD!  I grew up with a betamax version that had been recorded from a rental VHS, and had never found an official copy until now!

Animation techniques may age and look less slick and glowing then newer styles, but how often do you remember critiquing the art style of a film as a child?  Usually we are all simply sucked in by the motion, colours and especially the story.  The story ""The Little Mermaid"" as written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837, is what has endured more then 150 years with global reach and readership...and Disney has very little relation to it.

That is the key for this older-then-Disney rendition.  This is a English dub of a Japanese production by Toei, Anderusen d'wa ningyo hime, released in 1975.  It is true to the original in that it proves the tragedy and purity of love.  The mermaid and prince become friends, share laughter, and then she dies. It isn't until he has lost her that the Prince realizes the truth of the situation.  This teaches children MANY lessons.  Fiction and fairy tales serve as psychological safety valves that let the young begin to develop coping mechanisms for future life situations.  It also lets them in on some emotional values that they may not have otherwise been exposed to.  Censorship and neutering of tales because they're 'too sad'  or 'frightening' shows a lack of understanding of the purpose of fiction for children.

Give this version a try.  I grew up loving it and everyone I've shown it to has fallen in love with Marina and her plight.  The children have been sad at first, but there's always been clamour to see it again.  There's more reflection at the end for the viewer, child or adult!  Don't be afraid of helping your children to confront, safely, ideas about valuing what we have, dreams and hopes, the nature of love and purity, and the importance of seeking truth.",1280793600,,1921,4.666666666666667

1650729,4,B00005QW6Q,"My little sisters and I have been searching for this version of the Little Mermaid for years. Anyway, I'm writting because I can't help but laugh at all the reviewers who are saying this is bad for children because the mermaid dies at the end. I watched this movie over and over when my dad bought it for me. I was 8years old. It never scarred me or made me think that in order to be loved i have to sacrifice everything. Stop trying to wrap your children in bubbles away from real life. It's not doing them any good. This movie stayed with me in a positive way. I identified with the mermaid and everytime I watched this movie I hoped that somehow that idiot prince would realize that the woman who's perfect for him was right next to him and not that broad he was betrothed to. I made my younger sisters both watch the movie when they got around to the ages of 7 and 8 because I wanted them to understand it. They loved the movie. We prefer it a million times to the disney version. (And yes the disney one is great too, I love ursulua). It's not giving us the same crap of ""one day your prince will come"". This one is more realistic. And if you read the original story (you can look it up on wikipedia if you want) you will even get why she turns to foam and everything related to that.

My point is. I was not traumatized by this movie. Neither were my little sisters. I'm an adult now in my mid twenties and both my sisters are in their late teens. They're bugging me to buy this movie because we can't find our VHS version. As a parent, you know your own child and if they can handle this movie. Sit and watch it with them if you haven't seen it before. I will definitely show this movie to my children someday and have all ready shared this movie with some of my friends kids. They liked it too, even though we all cried at the end. :P

This is the anime version, but with no japanese language track and the cover is completely different from the actual movie. How odd. But anyway, there are five minutes taken out as many other reviewers have said. Buy the imported version if you can.

1650734,5,B00005QW6Q,"Yes, this is the original Little Mermaid that you remember from childhood, the one with Marina, Fritz, the evil cat, the whole thing.  I have no idea why they put a horrible picture that is not from the movie on the cover of the DVD, what a waste when the film is full of beautiful images.  I didn't buy this DVD for ages, afraid it wouldn't be the right one, I didn't trust the other photos that had been upload.  I should have.  I was so thrilled to have this film added to my DVD collection, finally.
This was one of two movies that my dad would rent for my when I was sick and had to stay home from school, the other was The Last Unicorn.  I loved being sick.
For those of you who grew up on this movie, I don't need to sell you on how amazing it is, but for those of you who have yet to have the pleasure of experiencing this film, don't hesitate to buy it.  True, it is dated, but it is classic.  I love the later Disney version of the tale with Ariel, but this one will always have a special place in my heart.  It follows the original Hans Christian Anderson story very closely, with only a few alterations that don't alter the tale in the slightest.  I have a read a couple reviews that caution that this film is not appropriate for younger children due to the 'tragedy' at the end.  Yes, most younger children will cry.  Many adults will cry as well.  It is ok for children to see films where everything doesn't turn out picture perfect.  How sad it would be if they never learned how to handle it when life is sad and difficult.  On the contrary, this film should be mandatory for all children.  The lessons about selflessness, true love, sacrifice, and the true meaning and purpose of life in this story are timeless and are in desperate need in a time when most are only willing to do what benefits them.  What a wonderful experience for parent to experience with their child.  You will absolutely treasure this movie, if you are an adult parent, a child, or a simply a lover of wonderful storytelling and mermaids!",1219795200,7,2028,4.267015706806283
1650735,5,B00005QW6Q,I originally watched this movie when I was a little girl and even til now at 26 I love watching this movie. Of course I always keep a box of tissues with me this time cuz its so emotional to watch. I honestly can say I love this version over the Disney version. But I agree with the reviewer below me. When I watched this as a kid it implanted the thought that Love is out there and when you find it ... you'll go through extreme lengths to keep it. I'll never get tired of watching this Movie. I Love it forever !!,1217116800,,515,3.9615384615384617
1650736,5,B00005QW6Q,"I want to encourage those of you who might be discouraged from seeing the movie based on some of the other reviews to instead see the movie and make up your own mind about its appropriateness in your children's lives.

I love this movie.  I have loved it since I first watched it at the age of three.  My experience with this film was completely different from the reviewers who have posted kid warnings arguing against it.  I do think other posters raise a valid concern: this is a sad film, and for some kids, it may be too much.  But for most kids, this movie has a lot of good lessons to impart.

First and most importantly, anyone who wants to see this movie should realize it is an entirely different story than the Disney version.  They happen to have the same title, but the two films bear little resemblance to each other otherwise.  To me, this is a good thing.  This movie is melancholy and poignant.  It is not an easy story, but it's tremendously worthwhile with a weighty moral at its heart. Usually I prefer happy endings, but in this story, to end it happily is to change the entire message of the story.

When I watched this film as a three-year old kid, I was struck by her final decision to give her life for the sake of the prince so he could live.  Yes, I cried, but then I begged my parents to watch it again and again.  I loved this little mermaid for her brave self-sacrifice.  At age 31, this movie still holds much meaning for me, and my understanding of the themes has deepened over time.  As a kid, I learned that the mermaid was brave and I wished so much that she could marry the prince!  As a teen I learned you cannot force someone to love you - much like my own crushes who never realized I was burning with unrequited love for them.  As an adult, I am fascinated by the themes of love and sacrifice, youth vs. maturity, and infatuation vs. selfless love.  This movie portrays triumph of the spiritual and altruistic nature over selfish desires by setting the mermaid up a terrible bind.  Her previous rash choices lead her to a situation where she has only two options left - kill the prince and live for three hundred years, or face up to the consequences (death) and sacrifice herself to spare his life.  She has a chance to dodge the consequences of her choices by doing something truly wrong, but instead, she recognizes the mistake it would be and she does the right thing.  Through selflessness she develops an immortal soul.  I think the mermaid becomes very noble by the end of the film.  She does not make the prince pay for her mistakes.  I do think true love wins in this movie - infatuation and romantic love certainly don't win, but true love - the consideration of others before oneself - shines forth.  Should we really omit this lesson from our children?  Only you as a parent can decide.

I believe you should watch this movie first and decide if you think it is worthwhile and your kids are ready for it. Some people will not like the ending of this movie.  Others will find fault with the strategically placed mermaid hair instead of shell bikini tops, but for me, these concerns are eclipsed by the important lessons about choice, consequences, love, mistakes, wisdom, youth, obedience, free will, sacrifice, and love presented by the story.  I think is captivating, beautiful, and bittersweet, and my kids enjoy the movie much like I did. So far we have watched the version taped from TV forever ago.  It has most (if not all) the scenes that are apparently deleted from this DVD version. They came away with a sense of wonder and wistfulness.  I can say with confidence that they are not scarred for life, nor have they had any nightmares.  I would argue that sad movies can be enjoyable and can teach your kids important life lessons.  Now all I have to decide is if I can handle the reportedly choppy editing enough to purchase the DVD version.  I've wanted it for a long time, but am annoyed that it is different than the original.",1213228800,,3990,4.450413223140496
1650737,3,B00005QW6Q,"In my young time, I've seen this great masterwork of Toei Animation.
The full Andersen story, with the original sad end.
It had stolen tears and when I see it back now, it keeps its original magic.

Too bad that this opus was censored : a lot of scenes are removed.  In fact all that show a little piece of nudity.  Sorry to tell you censors, but Sirens do not wear t-shirt under water, and young people see more than the scenes you've cut when seeing the tv ads...",1201132800,7,465,4.202247191011236

I was incredibly thrilled to find this on DVD after years of searching for one that wasn't someones bootleg copy taped from the VHS. Imagine my disappointment to see that like 4 minutes had been chopped from the film.
No longer does the sea witch brew the potion before your eyes, no longer does she talk about cutting out Marina's tongue. There is no more sisterly goodbye because you can see breasts. I understand we try to shield our children today, but my goodness, this is a classic how dare we tamper with it!",1200441600,60,617,4.421052631578948
1650769,5,B00005QW6Q,"I saw this movie when I was 4 years old and I loved it.  As an adult I've shown it to my nephews and nieces and we've all loved it.  I must agree with the reviewers that have stated that this movie is a bit harsh, specially when compared to Disney's sugar coated version, but this is also the perfect cautionary tale for little girls and potentially gay little boys.  In this version the mermaid dies because she gave everything up to be with a man; she modified her body and she lost her home, her family and her friends for love and in the end her prince marries another woman and lives happily ever after without the mermaid.  Isn't it better to expose children to this kind of truth through a fairy tale rather than letting them find out about it later in life?  I think so, better now through this movie than in 20 years from now with therapy and anti depressives.

About the nudity in this film, the mermaids are topless but there is no nipple and their hair covers their breasts most of the time, so it is not explicit at all.

All this said, the movie is beautiful, the art direction is superb and the story is faithful to the original Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale.  You won't regret purchasing this DVD.  It saddens me that this and so many other wonderful fairy tales have been thrown into the closet for being too dark, when in reality they are just cautionary tales meant to teach children about the dangers in life.  I'm also appalled that Disney turned this into a musical cartoon with a happy ending, it really defeats the purpose of the story.",1187568000,3,1565,4.384083044982699

La trama es fiel al cuento de Hans Christian, aunque algunos opinen que el final es cruel, deben recordar que la mayoria de los cuentos de Andersen, asi como de los hermanos Grimm son crueles y llenos de historias de horror. Es evidente que los nios van a necesitar una interpretacion paterna de la trama; desde mi punto de vista es mejor la interpretacion paterna que la interpretacion rosa de Disney.",1187136000,,606,4.663551401869159

  The storyline itself requires a kind heart. Marina's songs are soft and hard to hear and the dolphin gets annoying at times with his cries. However, if you have children, they will absolutely love this movie.

  If you're a Little Mermaid Disney fan, you might be disappointed, by this simple storyline. This one is for the kids of the eighties.",1180569600,,560,4.4950495049504955
1650772,4,B00005QW6Q,"As all the reviewers have said, this version of ""The Little Mermaid"" is not some cheesy cartoon. This is the 70's anime version that is based more on the original story then the happy Disney version. The mermaid's name is Marina and her dolphin friend is Fritz. It was great to finally find this movie on DVD. However, I had one problem with it. When the movie first came out, there was some nudity, though it was nothing serious. The mermaids are bra-less. However, in this DVD version, some of the movie appears choppy because they have edited out parts of certain scenes. Having watched the movie about 1000 times when I was a kid, I remember certain scenes to be longer. However, they only cut about 5 total minutes out of the movie and it is still the great animated film that I remember.

So why do companies hire amateurs to reproduce quality cover art?  The Secret of Nimh, The Last Unicorn... And this one for The Little Mermaid is the worst yet; it doesn't remotely resemble the film's protagonist.

Which is particularly absurd because the movie is not for the young audiences the cover is clearly targeted at.  At least not for them, only.  This version is more true to the tragedy of the original story and does not have the jolly happy end that the cover implies.",1177286400,3,610,4.663551401869159

1650776,4,B00005QW6Q,"This was the form of the Little Mermaid that I knew before Disney ever got to it.  I have to admit that it's not nearly as fun as the latter version but it does have its perks.  This classic story follows a little mermaid at her 'coming of age' named Marina and her little dolphin friend, Fritz.  As in all the stories, Marina ends up defying her parents and saves a drowning Prince.  Marina, having fallen in love with the prince, visits the sea witch to have her turn her into a human.  THis is agreed upon, only under the pretenses that she may never become a mermaid again (i.e. give up her family), would have her voice taken away, and she would die if she didn't win over the prince and be turned into seafoam because of it.  She goes on land, courts the prince, is shot down by his royal family as a suitor, and he is married off to a different exotic princess.  On the eve of his wedding night cruise, Marina is visited by her mermaid sisters and is given a second chance at life from the sea witch. Her only options are to either accept her death or she can force herself to stab the Prince with an enchanted knife in his heart and spill his blood on her feet to transform her gams into fins.  Because of her love, Marina chooses not to kill her Prince on his wedding night and instead jumps into the sea with a broken heart and is transformed into seafoam.  As you can tell, this is not the Disney version everybody else knows about.  The only part I think is missing is when the sea witch literally cuts out her tongue (as told in the original Hans version).  This was obviosly replaced with a magical way of 'losing her voice' in order to keep the story okay for children.  Although the animation and production isn't nearly as good of quality, this DVD does stay true to the story and certaintly doesn't sugar-coat anything.  It teaches such lessons in life as sacrifice, dedication, and punishment for one's actions.  Obviously there is a deep rooted lesson to be learned in love.  It can be viewed in a romantic way, with her actions interpreted in the end of the movie as 'selfless' and representative of 'true-love'.  Or you may be slightly more cynical and recognize Hans' bitter remorse for amour, representing it by showing that no matter how much Marina sacrifices for her love, it will never be returned.  Maybe a 'lesson on punishment' is left for forsaking your family for a man/world you don't even know.  I have probably read WAY to much into that story but it's still fun to analyze!  I think, ultimately, the story will get lost on young children nowadays who are used to the big Disney productions; but on the other hand, it is perfect for any TRUE Little Mermaid/Hans Christian Anderson fans, a slightly older audience ( ages 6-10), and those looking to expand their views.",1172361600,3,2803,4.450097847358121

I've been watching this version (on an old ripped-off vhs copy) as long as I can remember, and frankly I was a little disappointed that the Disney version turned out as sugary as it was.  Not that I don't love that one too.  As far as appropriateness for children, it is up to the parents' discretion.  There is a little minor nudity (it's appropriate to the story, not sexual at all), and the ending is very sad, but the original story went that way.  All of the classic HCA/Grimm fairy tales had some sort of gore and tragedy involved, and generations of people have survived fine after hearing those stories as children.

I hated that woman with the dark hair more than I hated the sea witch. That dark haired woman knew the little mermaid loved the prince but like all trifling hoes she had to steal the prince away.
