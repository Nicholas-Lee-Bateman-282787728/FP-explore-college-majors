2669605,5,B000JBXP20,"This show originally aired when I was a senior in high school, and everyone watched it, but me. I did not want anything to do with some mtv reality show. Ironically enough... a few weeks ago I caught a rerun on mtv, and I was hooked. So I immediately felt compelled to buy the season. My biggest complaint it that it is sooo short. Just 9 twenty minute episodes (excluding the first 40 minute episode). The bonus disc is very nice though. It has deleted scenes from each episode, enough material to add about 20 minutes to each. As others have mentioned, more football footage would have been cool, but I thought there was a good balance between the students personal and athletic lives.
I can now say I have finally been addicted to a reality show...just one that aired three years ago.",1252800000,4,787,4.510489510489511
2669606,5,B000JBXP20,"I live over in Japan and my wife, who is Japanese, asked me what was I watching, because she thought I was watching a college football show. when I told her that is was highschool, she could not believe that this was highschool and she kind of got hooked into the series as I did, but I wished they had more to show. I enjoyed every minute of the show and it made me miss highschool, because I love football and I enjoyed all the hard hits, the great passing and running and just the over all spirit this show had. I'm trying to catch the next season, so I can stay up to date with Hoover.",1217894400,,589,4.042735042735043

2669608,3,B000JBXP20,"Before the show came out, I was really excited about it. I was wondering how MTV would display Hoover's team and its players. I was kind of worried they would ruin Hoover's good image. Overall, I think they did a pretty good job. I think the show does do a good job depicting how high school is like from the point of view of the ""popular"" students - football players and cheerleaders. As for the show itself, I was rather disappointed at times because I was expecting the show to focus more on football and not on social relationships such as teen dating. At times it seemed the show focused little on football. I didn't like that. I wanted to see more indepth coverage of practices and games. With that said if I was a teen, I probably wouldnt mind the social aspect of the show. Its just not what I'm in to. If you are, I say great this is the show for you, however, if you are strictly a football fan looking for a documentary showing indepth coverage of a high school football dynasty you may be disappointed. Regardless, I'm proud of my hometown team and think its rather neat MTV picked us to do a show on.",1172102400,3,1113,4.304761904761905
2669609,5,B000JBXP20,"Two-A-Days has got to be the best show ever to come out of MTV. The DVD takes you back to that season over and over again. The special features are a nice addition to a great set. I have to say, after watching this show, it has made me look back into my life and re-evaluate everything in my life! The show is so gripping, heartwrenching, and moving that it will stay with you days after watching just one episode! Can't wait for the second season to start on January 30th!",1167609600,8,473,4.208791208791209

OF COURSE MAX WAS MY FAVORITE, BUT ALL OF MEMBERS ON THAT GREAT TEAM WERE AWESOME!  NOBODY COULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER QUARTERBACK THAN ROSS AND ALEX, AND ""REPEAT"" WERE GREAT TOO!!!",1167436800,3,353,4.661290322580645
