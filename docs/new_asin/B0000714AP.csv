1800862,5,B0000714AP,"Well if you're looking to buy this I'm guessing you're not a casual fan. You are probably like me a tight-wad who has put off for years buying the individual DVDs! Well now is the time to buy! The Twilight Zone is very much an individuals choice. There are universally loved episodes and the rest. The rest I find are the more interesting ones because I love a lot of them deemed average by ""experts"". I bought this because I've had it with ad breaks and logos on screen! You'll love at least 95% of the episodes here; use the search facility if you need titles. Just buy it; you know you want to!",1041984000,9,597,4.245614035087719
1800863,5,B0000714AP,"For those of us in the know, all TZ episodes have been available on DVD for quite some time, but in 40-some odd volumes that contained 3 to 4 episodes each and left you broke after about 20 volumes. Now, As I write this, we are a couple months away from being able to own the entire Twilight Zone series in a collection of 5 box sets,... Has Image Entertainment finally given TZ fans something worth emptying their pockets for? You bet.
Okay, so they still haven't put the series in chronological order. Don't wait -- this will probably never happen. It's an anthology series and there is no continuity here that absolutely demands you have the episodes in order. But what Image has done is put 9 volumes in each box set (Vols. 1-9 are contained in Collection 1) and made the cases a little more compact. These are great cases, by the way, and the box isn't just something to throw away either. The episodes in Collection 1 are among the most memorable: ""To Serve Man"", ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"", ""Time Enough At Last"", ""The Lonely"", ""The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street"", ""The Invaders"", and ""It's A Good Life"", to name only a few of the 35 episodes.
Quite simply, these releases (meaning not only Collection 1, but the 4 others) mean that you'll be able to own the series on DVD for [much less money than]it would cost you to buy the volumes individually...",1041465600,107,1361,4.491935483870968

1800865,4,B0000714AP,"I had about 10 episode discs I had bought, but I could see the end result would just be too costly. So, I waited, not sure why, mostly for ""space"" reasons. After the original Star Trek series I bought one at a time, my ""warehouse"" was FULL! Anyway, I really like the slimline ""look"" and the space they save is much appreciated, plus I got this at a great price. I really do not like the menu set-up on these, it is very slow and time-consuming to deal with the ""eye"". Also, the sound for this ""eye"" movement is lounder and almost ""jarring"" when going from viewing an episode back into the main menu. So, my advice is to turn the volume off before the episode starts, turn it back on for the ep, then again turn it off when the ""eye"" comes back. The notes included are helpful and interesting. I don't know why they didn't include the ""laserdisc"" interviews with Serling I own, or even put more episodes per disc, and IN ORDER would have been nice, so I lopped a star off on this account. However, the performance's we know are ""six"" stars. The episode ""A game of Pool"", and the dialogue enclosed in that one show was just about worth the price for the whole set. I feel for those who went out of their way and laid out the cash for all these seperately, and normally that is me as well, however, this time the powers that be gave me a break:)",1040947200,10,1342,4.22568093385214

The hitch hiker, nightmare at 20,000 feet, kick the can.
and episodes  that I've never even seen but loved none the less like the invaders. (an episode with no talking but still manages to serve as an example of shear  brilliance.)
Collection 1 arrived early and in perfect condition. Since then it has made me very happy.
I could gush on and on forever about how much I love the twilight zone, and I believe it goes without saying this is a great thing for anyone remotely interested in psychological/thriller/creepy/Classic ""B"" style/(golden-age of )sci-fi sub-genre to own (episodes will absolutely turn into conversation pieces*) besides everyone needs something erie in their life Right?

1800868,4,B0000714AP,"Even though CBS released the ""definitive"" edition with even better picture and sound quality from the 35mm masters, and with extras, this set isn't bad for the price. In other words, you pay a few dollars more to get more, but if you are more interested in price then grab this box set.

One small note: I definately agree with other reviewers. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plus pages includes ""everything"" about the classic series and is a wonderful companion with the DVDs. The book details Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you. What you do is watch an episode and then read up on it in the book and you'll discover a wealth of trivia that makes this worthy of appreciation. Both the DVD set and the book is on Amazon.com so check it out (samples are available on Amazon's review page). Do yourself the favor and get both.

1800869,4,B0000714AP,"I spent over $800 on the VHS videos from Columbia House two decades ago. I spent less than $140 for the complete DVD set and discovered the value.
Sadly, while the quality and price is superb, the definitive set (also on Amazon) beats the quality and extras and price ten-fold.

However, the retail price keeps lowering over the months making this worthwhile if you don't want to spend the additional $5 bucks and get superior picture and sound quality and bonus extras.

I also suggest you buy ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD box set. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun. Regardless of whether you buy this set or the definitive box sets, watching the shows is one thing, knowing the behind-the-scenes stuff is even more fun.

1800870,1,B0000714AP,"Do not purchase any of the NON-definitive edition twilight zone box sets. They are inferior products in comparison to the follow-up sets, which were reissued about 11 months after the fifth and final original collections.

The definitive editions are absolute must haves. Besides the additional content, the sound, video and navigational controls are much better. It is an absolute disgrace that this product is still being sold at such an outrageously high price. It is worth about $20 to $30.

Disclaimer:

I am writing with the bias of a ripped off consumer.

After spending close to $450 dollars on the original five sets,  season one of the Definitives was released within a year after the last original was put on sale. I contacted the manufacturer about this flagrant disregard for consumers and received the  usual 'blah blah blah...sorry, there's nothing we can do...."" response.

If you can't afford the Definitive Editions, I recommend monitoring ebay where you can acquire the originals for a more reasonable price approaching fair market value.

Afterward: My complaints are not about the content; the product is a classic that will continue to entertain viewers for years to come, but  repackaged and upgraded products should be discounted--like software programs--for people that have already invested in earlier editions.

Buy the Definitive editions. Do not buy these inferior outdated and overpriced inventory outcasts.

1800872,5,B0000714AP,"In an era of rubber monsters,creature features and fears of a

soviet invasion,Rod Serling's Twilight Zone stands out as one

of the most intelligent things to have ever screened on T.V.

despite being widely criticised at the time by zealous t.v.

critics for it's sci-fi content it thoughtfully challenged a

lot of the social/political notions of the day(and some that sadly still need to be challenged today).

What was missed by the critics was that confronting issues of race etc in the late50s/early 60's was a highly risky manouevere particularly in the medium of Television.

Though this is not to say Rod Serling didn't enjoy the otherworldly element of the twilight zone which he used as a storytelling method.

I grew up in the 80's and though knew of the twilight zone through numerous pop culture references and the 80's incarnation of the show it wasn't untill the advent of DVD that I actively began to seek out the twilight zones of the 50's and what a fantastic find, for me it is the best television show ever mixing black comedy(Time enough at Last)social commentary(The monsters are due on Maple Street) and out and out sci-fi/horror fun(Nightmare at 10,000 feet).

If you don't own any Twilight Zone material the collection boxsets are really the way to go,if you buy the single dvds you'll usually find that you've become that addicted to them you'll wind up searching e-bay at 2am in the morning contemplating paying some exorbortant fee for a second hand copy you can't find anywhere!!

These boxsets are well presented and are more value for money than collecting the individual dvds, as being a perfectionist when it comes to collecting items i went through agony trying to obtain all 40 of them which i ran out of money trying to do(although i did wind up buying and keeping ""Treasures of the twilight zone"" and ""More Treasures of the Twilight zone"" which i do reccomend if you're nearing the completion of your Twilight Zone collection).

Rod Serling what a brilliant storyteller,truly a shakespeare in the golden age of Television,a shining beacon of intellectual hope in a sea of canned laughter and soap and ciggarette commercials.

DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND BUY THIS NOW!!",1125619200,5,2204,4.879356568364611
1800873,5,B0000714AP,"I have been a huge fan of the Twilight Zone since I first watched it as a kid (in reruns), so when I finally had some extra money, I bought Collection 1 at a used record store for $65.

Would I do it again? Absolutely. Am I going to get the rest of the series? Yes. Am I going to pay full price for them? Not if I can help it.

Let me also say that I RARELY purchase DVDs that I can rent; I think I've only bought a half-dozen DVDs in two years. But I am going to get all of these when I can.

The thing about TZ is that many of the episodes were so good, so frightening, so touching, and so challenging, that despite the lack of engaging bonus materials (just some text cribbed from Marc Scott Zicree's great book, ""The Twilight Zone Companion""), a lame menu screen (the eye looks like it's wearing a bowler hat), and a high price tag, the Collection is still worth it, simply because the episodes themselves are that good.

These shows were made in a Golden Age of TV writing, with some of the best actors around. Even with limited technology (yes Virginia, you CAN make a good  motion picture without CGI), I can't take my eyes off the screen. There are some duds in the series (no one ever bats 1.000 for long, so forgive the series), but the lackluster episodes are outweighed by some of the best moments in the history of the boob tube: Burgess Meridith's performance at the end of ""Time Enough to Last"", for example, or William Shatner in his pre-Capt. Kirk days in the forgotten gem, ""Nick of Time"", as well as the crowd-pleasing ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"". BTW, those three episodes are on Collection #1.

The only things I really like about the package, though, is the thin DVD cases (tho there is no written material to accompany), and the way they grouped the episodes together (four per DVD), which is roughly thematic as opposed to chronological/seasonal. So you can pop one in, sit back and watch four ""death"" episodes, or four ""mind power"" episodes, etc. If you dare, turn the lights out and watch the four ""living doll"" episodes (which is actually on collection 2, I believe).

For parents, this series was made when smoking was very popular (host Rod Serling was a chain smoker), so expect someone to light up in every other episode, but sex scenes are barely over PG, and the violence is wonderfully subdued (PG-13). Nevertheless, the themes and tension in some of these might be more than some kids can handle. ""Chucky"" from the ""Child's Play"" movies is just goofy, whereas ""Talking Tina"" (again, from the ""Living Doll"" episode) can still give me nightmares. Also, some of the concepts (racism, fear of nuclear war, fear of technology, the horrors of war) might be difficult, especially if kids aren't familiar with the historical context.

Overall, I strongly recommend any of the collections in this series to literally anyone who enjoys a good story.",1118793600,7,2873,4.543520309477756

This show is great, no doubt. One of my all-time favorites, in fact. But 35 episodes for anywhere from $75 to $100 depending on where you buy?!?! I bought 35 HOUR-LONG episodes of the equally excellent Outer Limits for about the same price. The 35 episodes that make up the first season of the Andy Griffith show are going for half that at 30 bucks!! Again, another equally excellent classic.

1800877,3,B0000714AP,"First: If you're reading this, then you probably enjoy the show and are at least slightly more familiar with it than passing fancy, so don't get me wrong: TZ is an A+, 10.0, five star show, even the final season has enough 'gems' to call it great. The three star rating I give this product goes toward the packaging and price. TZ was originally released on DVD many years ago, back when DVDs were 25 bucks a piece and still a pretty new item. The five collections set available today is the same DVDs repackaged. There is nothing special about the packaging: no program guide or booklet, and it's just a bunch of slim cases put in a nondescript box. I have watched the price for the collections steadily drop until this weekend, when I bought the first collection for thirty-five dollars at a local Wal-Mart: when I got home I realized that 'collection one' does not equate to season one, but just the first eight originally separately-sold DVD collections, which are completely muddled, with episodes spanning the complete span of the series. As one reviewer already mentioned, this doesn't matter because the series was 100% stand-alone, and no two episodes jived or seamed together; if you're a true purist, though, Amazon will be selling the 'Definitive' collection come December 28th for a very reasonable starting price (which should drive down the prices of the currently available 5 collections). This is the complete 1st season (1959-1060, 36 episodes) and includes the 'next week on TZ' previews and commercials originally aired back before I was born. But back to the currently available sets...As an aside: we've been brainwashed into ""the last two years of TZ suck, don't bother watching them,' so by jumbling them together we're encouraged to watch, eventually, all the episodes...and some of the last really are the best.

1800879,5,B0000714AP,"Unbelieveable story telling with unpredictable twists have made me, a young, new fan to the series, love this series and every single twisted pathway that is the Twilight Zone. Unique in every way, it is unparalleled to this day for creativity and thought ever put into a television show. From the great love story "" Two"" to the comedic "" Mr. Dingle the Strong"" many of the greats are here. My experience with the Twilight Zone began last year, at halloween. My parents gave me The Treasures of the Twilight Zone, and More Treasures of the Twilight Zone. Being a naive youth that I often am, I contemplated taking back the DVDs. With great reluctance I decided to keep the DVDs, and opened them. And so, my mind became enthralled by this delightful series, which seemed to have been part of me before I had ever been truly exposed to the Twilight Zone ( Save the movie, which is a valiant attempt at recreating the Twilight Zone, it did frighten me to see the Creature at 20,000 feet at whatever age I first saw it). My mind was hooked with "" Where is Everybody?"" Which to this day remains my favorite, only furthering another reviewer's insight on being young and seeing this particular episode ( on a friday night at that). The next day I watched The Encounter, which with the right weather outside left me with a feeling of pure magic. This led with a need for more, so for my birthday, my parents gave me this collection, along with the Twilight Zone Companion. It has only furthered my love, and I can not wait to get collection 2 either on my own or as a gift. If you have a son or daughter who has an open mind and an active imagination, this is a perfect gift, give them the opportunity of experiencing possibly the best Television series ever made. This collection is very encompassing, going from space, to matters of the mind, to questions we all come upon. If you're on the boder of buying this set, buy the Trteasures first, then see where you were unfounded in your worries. This is honestly one of the greatest gifts anyone has ever given me. I bonded with a friend even more over this series. The most important thing it gave me was piece of mind.

1800881,5,B0000714AP,"I have spent $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$'s on Twilight Zone videos from Columbia House. And I will happily buy all five 'Collection' series after viewing this first collection. Too see these episodes all in pristine condition, with the little extras, is a thrill.

Even the Art Carney episode shot on video tape is enhanced to the point of perfection. The video copy from Columbia House was poor, and left me not interested in seeing it again. This restored copy brings not only the image to a silken pristine level, but elevates the story, which on viewing it again, deserves the treatment given here.

As a child, 'Twilight Zone,' 'The Outer Limits' (which has also been beautifully restored and packaged), and 'One Step Beyond' captivated my young mind. But it was the whole presentation of 'Twilight Zone' that intellectually stimulated my very young mind. I was glued to the television in the early sixties and find myself equally entranced forty years later. The high quality of the storylines pass the test of time.

Not only do the quality of the storylines bring 'Twilight Zone' to an unmatched level, but the actors chosen, bring an integrity and credibilty often lacking on television. Here fantasy meets reality in the stark nakedness of human frailties and private demons that seep from all our psyches. We're all unmasked a little in each show. We're all a little unnerved by the truth revealed about this thing called 'Man' and 'Humanity.'

Life does not leave much television time for us. But when I do have the time to relax and enjoy television or dvd's, I want it to be not only entertaining, but engaging and time well spent. And 'Twilight Zone' is the perfect collection to fill that bill. I highly recommend this collection.",1096329600,5,1744,4.921768707482993
1800882,2,B0000714AP,"Well, at least in my opinion it won't be, which is a shame. The reason why involves the potential lack of profit in doing so. The reason is not chronological order; with a show like the Twilight Zone, this means nothing. We're not talking about a series that has any type of continuity. Each episode was its own, with no cross references.
The problem is that the quality of the show went down in its fourth season, and took an even sharper dip during its fifth and final season. Don't get me wrong, there were some gems to be found; ""Living Doll"", ""Death Ship"", ""Steel"", ""The Masks"", and ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" are some that come to mind. But I think most fans of the series will agree with me in that the gold mine lay in the first three seasons.
So don't hold your breath for a season release. The company that did so would likely lose money on the final two sets.",1086480000,17,870,4.310975609756097

And after some time I was able to buy the first set. I didn't realize till later on that the episodes where out of order, but you know what? I didn't care. I love all the episodes displayed in the set. Do I think it's odd? Yes, but so is the series and highly under rated at this day and time. Rod Serling is certainly a genius and it's a wonder to all the things that were imagined and created during The Twilight Zone series. Which also was jam packed with a lot of classic celebrities such as: Elizabeth Montgomery, Robert Redford, Burgess Maredith (who was a constant guest star through out the series), William Shatner (before Star Trek I believe), Charles Bronson, Jack Warden, Buddy Ebsen and tons more. This series is thought provoking, but makes it entertaining not only for a science fiction fan, but for the regular viewing audience. Some of the episodes aren't very clear on the DVD, but I believe that's the type of film they had back at the time. But it does come with trivia games, and a chronological (again out of order) history of The Twilight Zone. Some of my favorite episodes include: Night of the Meek, The Invaders, Time Enough at Last, The Monsters are Due on Maple Street, Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, Walking Distance, Two, A Passage for Trumpet, Long Distance Call, I Sing the Body Electric, The Passerby, The Hitch-Hiker, Third from the Sun, To Serve Man (which I think is one of the creepiest episode in the series), and of course the classic It's a Good Life from what everyone loves to remember including on a Simpson's Halloween Episode - I believe. I admire Rod Serling very much for his creative writing and thought provoking episodes - he was before his time.

 I brought ALL 5 collections of the Twilight Zone so despite any issue I have with the ways chosen to navigate the DVD you would be a fool to let the lame DVD menu design format and layoout stop you from buying the most awesome set of Twilight Zone DVD's you could ever hope to own.
Another problem is the information goes to the next page after a prescribed time automatically throughout the DVD assuming everyone has the same fast reading speed of what some nut job hack thinks is ""normal reading speed"".  Like haven't the corporate air heads that made these DVD's ever heard of learning disabilities and other challenges that slow a persons reading.  Even without learning disabilities how stupid it was for the makers of the DVD to assume every reader is going to be an Evelyn Wood Speed Reader.  I ended up having to keep finding the same page till I finished reading it at my slow deliberate cerebral palsied & autistic reading speed.
I could go on and on about how dumb and totally insensitive to the needs of disabled people the DVD menu design is in many other ways.  Once past the bad layout image choice and menu design of the DVD the quality of the Twilight Zone episodic content is fantastic.  Episodes while not in any particular order based on air date or anything else is another pet peeve I have about how these collections were arranged.  However what really matters is the video sound and overall quality of the actual episodes is first rate and will NOT DISSAPOINT even the harshest fair minded critic \ buyer.
Remember you are not buying the DVD's for the way lame pathetic insensitive stupid way the menus are designed you just want the Twilight Zone Episodes to be first rate and trust me they are far better than just first rate.  I took one star off my 4 star rating only because the menus are so totally disabled user unfriendly which is just plain mean and stupid.

If Via$$$ ever decides to reissue the TZ correctly then Donny will buy.  But until then I have the done correctly Season one of Outer Limits.",1074297600,11,630,4.396551724137931
1800888,2,B0000714AP,"I've been a big fan of TZ since it was rerun when I was a little kid and I was ecstatic when I heard they were releasing the entire series on DVD. I bought the first two box sets and was quite dismayed by the quality of the release. The shows are well mastered, but there is very very little extras added in, the menus are very poorly designed, and (most annoying, esp. for a ""complete"" set of releases) the episodes aren't even in any sensible order (why not chronological? Ugh!) This is the first series of DVD's I've decided not to collect all of and I'll be selling mine used. :^(",1072569600,12,584,4.223214285714286
1800889,5,B0000714AP,"I don't know what your favorite TV show is but mine has ALWAYS been ""The Twilight Zone"".  It bothered me that for years we could get ""Gilligan's Island"" re-runs but there were never any of ""The Twilight Zone"".  I hadn't seen an episode for over 35 years so I finally decided to check out their availability on DVD (after all, my teen-age daughter has all of the episodes of ""Friends"" on DVD).  The price was a bit steep but I came into some extra money and took the plunge.  I have been completely satisfied with this package of 36 episodes on a set of 9 DVDs.  After I ordered it, I talked them up to my 11 year old son who looked forward to watching them with me.  He was impressed as well.  I mention that because today's youth seem overly focused on modern technology and these episodes left a lot to your imagination.
""The Twilight Zone"" was a unique TV series that mixed excellent writing (mostly by Rod Serling, himself, in the early seasons), good acting, challenging social issues, and stories that were unsettling if not downright scary.  Many of those episodes stayed with me decades after I had seen them; far more than from any other TV show.  I watched ""Outer Limits"", ""The Alfred Hitchcock Show"" and others.  They were very good as well but ""Twilight Zone"" was always a notch above.  Even now, knowing how many of these episodes would turn out, I was impressed by the quality of the product.  What surprized me was how excellent they all were.  There were some that were in a class by themselves but all were worthwhile.  ""Monsters are Due on Maple Street"" was always my favorite and it is in this collection along with such all-time favorites as Burgess Meredith's classic ""Time Enough at Last"", William Shatner in ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"", Jack Warden in ""The Lonely"", ""To Serve Man"", and Billy Mumy in the haunting ""It's a Good Life"".  However, my favorite episode now is ""Walking Distance"" in which Gig Young discovers why you can't go home again.  Many of the messages in these stories are timeless.
I saved up some money and am ready to order the next set.  My son is as anxious to see them as I am.",1071964800,55,2122,4.4986945169712795
1800890,5,B0000714AP,"What's really frustrating nowadays is that a lot of directors think that they can satisfy an audience by throwing in a lot of sex,nudity,buckets of blood as well as body parts. But ""The Twilight Zone"" should serve as an example that you don't need all that [stuff] to make a good spine tingling,thought provoking movie or TV series!
My only complaint like eveyone else is that the episodes are not in chronological order and 90$ for 900 min is kind of expensive comparing the fact that you can buy each season of ""24"" starring Kiefer Sutherland which is 999 min long for 48$ and on 6 discs instead of 9 discs for the Twilight Zone. Apart from that, to have all 156 episodes on 5 collections is a dream come true!!!!!!!!
The Twilight Zone , The fugitive (1960) and 24 are my fav TV series!",1063065600,4,788,4.441379310344828
1800891,5,B0000714AP,"The Twilight Zone's brilliance, innovation, and penetrating insights into man's nature and fallibility shine through as much now as when first introduced in the Cold War era.  Whether an episode reflects man's confrontation with the fantastic, the known world but with a wrinkle, or himself, it comes across captivating if not in instances compelling.  As with Mark Twain's stories, the hard lessons communicated are rooted in a positive orientation toward people, which makes them palatable.  And the packaging into 25-minute episodes makes it very convenient to pop into the DVD player when that amount of free time presents itself.
The Twilight Zone can be an acquired taste.  Try a sampler, then steer by your reactions as you go.  Seriously consider this as a gift for those on your list who have everything and/or are difficult to buy for.",1061683200,,845,5.094202898550725
1800892,5,B0000714AP,"This is hands-down my favorite television series, and now it's on DVD in superlative form. You can't go wrong with any of the five collections.",1061596800,,143,4.76
1800893,5,B0000714AP,"Having had a partial collection on video for many years now, I anxiously awaited the release on DVD. Finally! The complete series (156 episodes) has finally received the treatment it truly deserves. This series has held up well for 40+ years, and I have no doubt it will make it for at least another half century. Television writing was at its peak with this show, and the evolution of television filming (and videotaping) techniques is obvious over the course of this series. And the trademark twists at the end of each episode still take me by surprise!
Technically, the digital remastering to DVD has brought new life to Rod Serling's brainchild. The video presentation is crisp and well defined, bringing out the subtle details so well, that you will find yourself completely absorbed in the nuances of Serling's vision, and the outstanding production values for this early 60's series (just keep in mind that this is pre-Computer Generation era). The audio was clear, and blissfully noise free, but a bit low on the volume when compared to the title and menu audio tracks (both on the geyeballh version of the earlier disks, and the intro sequences on the later disks). The shows are presented in their original format, so no widescreen version is necessary. And television always translates well to...well, television. Although the extras include a Rod Serling bio, a brief synopsis of each of the 5 seasons that the series ran, and a Twilight Zone history, these features are identical on each disc. The true gem of the extra features is the episode synopsis and review. Each disc is unique in this respect, with a plot summary and some background ""inside info"". Although mostly taken from the book ""The Twilight Zone Companion,"" I found this feature to be the most interesting.
Each collection has its ghitsh and gmissesh, but the series is, overall, a rewarding experience. The only ""disappointments"" that I found were the collection's lack of a subtitles option (which I really would have appreciated), and the fact that the episodes are not in order (which slightly detracts from observing the actual progression of growth within the series). That makes this more of a 4 1/2 star rating (but you can't do that, can you?). If you have ever enjoyed even one episode of this legendary series, you will not regret buying these collections. And if you've never seen it, give it a try...you'll be hooked.",1055030400,5,2409,4.9068627450980395
1800894,5,B0000714AP,"For all Twilight Zone fans, you've hit the jackpot with this outstanding collection of episodes in the first installment.
Featuring 35 episodes over 9 discs, it is a true gem of a deal and certainly worth the money.  There are Twilight Zone sets that can be purchased that are in chronological order but if you're not that picky, you only have to look this far to be completely satisfied.  Each program is digitally remastered and reveals an impressive video quality considering this material is more than 2 decades old.  Very few digital artifacts are present and detail is excellent.
The DVD set has some nice special features offered also which adds to the enjoyment including: Rod Serling Biography, Twilight Zone history, Episode reviews, Cast Information, and Season by Season commentary.  There are 4 other collections that complete the entire set and give you every episode ever done (156 total I think).  They all have the special features too and are wonderfully done.
Even if you are not a Twilight Zone fan but are intrigued by science-fiction, fantasy, the unknown, the uncanny, or whatever else, you will probably find yourself immensely pleased with the content offered here.  A very highly recommended collection that is exceptionally well done at a nice price.  Enjoy!",1049155200,29,1285,5.061611374407583

7974021,5,B0000714AP,"Even though it has been over 50 years since the first episode of ""Twilight Zone"" appeared on TV it is still one of the best series of all time. The entire Twilight Zone series has been released on a series of 45 DVDs containing 3 to 4 episodes on each DVD. They then split up the DVDs into box sets with 9 DVDs each, a total of 5 collection boxes. Collection 1 has DVDs 1 through 9. Many of the classic episodes are in this collection. Way too many to list all of them but among the best of the best include ""Time Enough At Last"" (one of 4 TZ episodes that Burgess Meredith appeared in), ""The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street"", ""Nightmare At 20,000 Feet"", ""A Game Of Pool"" (one of 4 TZ episodes that Jack Klugman appeared in tying him with Burgess Meredith for the most appearances on the show. Jonathan Winters co-starred in the episode), ""I Sing The Body Electric"", ""The Passersby"", ""Death-Head Revisited"", ""To Serve Man"" (spoiler alert! it's a cook book) and ""It's A Good Life"". The picture quality is very good on these discs which just makes is all the more enjoyable to watch.
