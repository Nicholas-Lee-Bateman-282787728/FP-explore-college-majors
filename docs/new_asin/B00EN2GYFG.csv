5928123,4,B00EN2GYFG,"Season 20 of Top Gear was very good but in my opinion, not one of their better seasons.  For me there just wasn't as many funny shenanigans as in seasons past.  Still entertaining though.",1391731200,,187,4.470588235294118
5928124,1,B00EN2GYFG,"I like the show, have watched it for many years......  What is the point of shooting this series in HD and then discontinuing the Blu-ray disk option?  I will continue to give 1 star reviews until you bring Blu-ray back.",1391299200,3,220,4.475
5928125,5,B00EN2GYFG,"It's only got two disc meaning less episodes but still worth collecting.

Also a lot cheaper which can only be a good thing but do wish BBC and TG/UK would revert back to Blu Ray
and re-issue Season's 18 to 20.

Great cars and places with the hosts' as witty and juvenile as ever.

Can't wait to see Season 21 on the T.V.",1390953600,,321,4.063492063492063
5928126,5,B00EN2GYFG,"Jeremy interviews celebrities.  James reminisces about the good old days.  Richard flies off in his helicopter.  And once in a while, we see cars.

The cars tend to be the heady stuff of teenage bedroom posters.  The speeds are far beyond legal, the pranks and stunts the kind of thing that ought to see these guys behind bars and the Stig never comments in a language humans can understand, let alone hear.

My only complaint: a mere six episodes in this season.  SIX!  Fortunately the Beeb brings new seasons out pretty quickly.",1390867200,,530,4.684782608695652
5928127,5,B00EN2GYFG,"As always, my only, and I really do mean only, complaint is that the BBC does not make Top Gear in Blueray. With the vivid colors, incredible scenes and camera shots this show would be AMAZING if it came in high def and I am not sure why the BBC does not keep up with the times with the series. Oh well.",1390262400,3,303,3.903225806451613
5928128,5,B00EN2GYFG,"It may not be the most exciting season ever, at least not to us Americans when they are discussing hot hatches, but I find myself loving every minute of it, and so do my friends and family.  Its seriously a show anyone can watch and enjoy.  This season delivers a good blend of British humor and Top Gear's famously amazing cinematography while Jeremy, James, and Richard continue to mesh together better every year.  It was a long time coming, but its worth the wait.",1390176000,,468,4.5476190476190474
5928129,5,B00EN2GYFG,The best race is the cross country race pulling travel trailers.  I nearly fell off the sofa laughing.,1453248000,,102,4.666666666666667

5928137,5,B00EN2GYFG,Great Top Gear with the proper presenters,1430352000,,41,5.0
5928138,5,B00EN2GYFG,"The original top gear is the best most entertaining  show on tv. The presenters  have great chemistry, banter they engage  in is lovely, unforced, comments politically incorrect. That incorrectness is so very refreshing, mostly because it is so rare in todays world. Add to all this awsome cars, challenges  and drives through the most beautiful places on earth and you get yourself hours of fun whethet you're  man or woman ( I'm  female).",1429142400,,440,4.958904109589041

5928141,5,B00EN2GYFG,"Fantastic! There is a reason why Top Gear is the most watched show on the planet. Top Gear is more than just a car show. It's a show about three friends, adventures, challenges, comedy and fun.",1425427200,,193,4.388888888888889

5928156,5,B00EN2GYFG,As I have previously stated I was very happy with the merchandise that I received and I would just like to be updated on the model: diecast vehicles 1/18 scale that resemble the one my wish list and recent purchases thank you,1401753600,,225,4.380952380952381
5928157,5,B00EN2GYFG,"Top Gear 20 was one of the best seasons yet. The challenges were excellent. Jeremy, James and Richard are always entertaining. I hope they go on for another 20 series at least!",1399161600,,176,4.53125
5928158,4,B00EN2GYFG,"There's never been a bad one.  Always entertaining.  Never a dull moment with this crew.  The only way it could be better, is if they made more episodes per year.",1399161600,,162,4.333333333333333

If you are a car enthusiast it is a must see.",1395705600,,103,3.5217391304347827
5928162,5,B00EN2GYFG,I don't think there is ANY television series as entertaining as Top Gear. Every single season gets progressively better and funnier. Highly recommended.,1395619200,,152,5.6521739130434785
5928163,5,B00EN2GYFG,It's Top Gear (UK version) how can it NOT be good.  Only that every year they start to look much older and gain more weight  :(  Still LOVE the cars and challenges tho!  I with they'd offer seasons 1 through 7 on DVD,1395619200,,216,3.953488372093023

5928166,5,B00EN2GYFG,"Again the boys including ""The Sting"" are using humor to make cars amazing, interesting and possibly attainable. They are irrelevant
and at time politically incorrect but I still love them. Can't wait for season 21",1394928000,,213,5.114285714285714
5928167,5,B00EN2GYFG,I love watching Top Gear I have all the seasons can't wait till the next season comes out. Best Show on TV,1394496000,,106,3.8636363636363638

5928169,5,B00EN2GYFG,"I've been a huge fan of Top Gear UK for years now. Not having cable makes watching episodes hard of course, so I've been buying the DVD's, and I got this one for a good price on sale. I absolutely love it! One of my all time favorite Top Gear moments comes from this season. Absolutely fantastic!",1393977600,,296,4.2105263157894735
5928170,4,B00EN2GYFG,more of the same but somehow they make it fresh But I think it is not as good as the last season which is the first time I would have said that,1393632000,,143,3.5
5928171,5,B00EN2GYFG,Jermy and the boys are as much fun as ever. The boys still seam to be enjoying themselves on their test drives and each other.,1393632000,,126,4.08
5928172,5,B00EN2GYFG,I enjoyed it always.  Every year is always something to see and see what they can do. They might age but still do it superb.,1393459200,,124,3.96
5928173,5,B00EN2GYFG,I love the show and re-watch episodes often. Didn't want to wait for this season to be free on amazon prime or Netflix so I spent the $10 and it was well worth it!,1393027200,,163,3.823529411764706
5928174,5,B00EN2GYFG,Cannot wait until season 21 comes out which I am sure will be just as good. Keep up the good work guys!!!!!!!!!!!!,1392595200,,114,4.2272727272727275
5928175,3,B00EN2GYFG,"I just finished watching season 20 on DVD. It only has two discs containing 6 episodes (and some bonus stuff), 3 episodes are repeats that I've seen in older seasons. What gives? And was there really only 3 episodes last season or did only 3 episodes make it for sale on DVD? Something seems off here. No wonder it was only $10 on release day....

I did enjoy the 3 new episodes though. Long live Top Gear. 8-)",1392163200,5,410,4.256410256410256

5928178,5,B00EN2GYFG,"This wasn't as long as some of the other series (only six episodes, and few special features), but it delivers the same quality we have come to expect.  One of the top ten shows of all time - if you haven't checked it out, you really should.",1391817600,,241,4.127659574468085
