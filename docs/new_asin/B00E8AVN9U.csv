5894743,5,B00E8AVN9U,"Does anyone know whether this set will be *TRULY COMPLETE* -- will it include the four made-for-TV movies that followed the series?  Also, the first three seasons were released on double-sided discs (undoubtedly to save money) and there were technical problems with some of them -- discs froze in the middle of several episodes and would not continue playing.  Have the first three seasons been remastered for this set and will they be released on single-sided discs? If not, and if the four TV movies are not included (and it would be stupid not to include them), then I will not bother purchasing this set as I already own all twelve individual seasons and the four-movie set.

(Incidentally, the five-star rating is for the shows themselves, as well as for my deep and abiding love for the divine Angela Lansbury.)",1376524800,37,817,4.821428571428571
5894744,5,B00E8AVN9U,"Just think, if you ever sat down and watched each one of these 264 episodes end-to-end for 24 hours a day, it would take over 8 and half days to watch the entire series that ran for 12 seasons on TV (from 1984 to 1996). Since I think at least one murder occurred in every episode, that's one a heck of a lot of murders. I was always amazed that every place Jessica ever went, another murder occurred, and many of them right there in her own small town of Cabot Cove, Maine. That place must have been the murder capital of the world. I certainly wouldn't want to be around Jessica for very long or I just might have turned up dead. Even though this TV series is still on TV in reruns, we still watch it every day it's on. We truly love it. I'm sure we've probably seen every episode numerous times but we still enjoy watching each one of them. We already own every one of the 12 individual sets, but it's interesting to see it re-released as one complete set (but I guess without the 4 extra movies). Great series. FIVE Stars for sure.",1375228800,73,1034,4.201005025125628

5894788,5,B00E8AVN9U,"A fun series.  We watched the entire set, and it's amazing how many episodes we had never seen, even on the original airings and the years of syndication.  When researching, one of the reviewer was amazed that the series ran as long as it did and that Cabot Cove should have been depopulated because of all the murders occurring there.
  To be true, as I remember it, most of the murders occurred away from Cabot Cove.  So many of the main characters in Cabot Cove were fun to watch and listen to and were believable.
  Would I recommend this to others, the answer is OH YES!  We've enjoyed it at least twice over during the time since we purchased them.  Do you want fun, no extreme violence or compromising situations or language that you wouldn't want your young children to be exposed to.",1517875200,10,792,4.4825174825174825

5894817,5,B00E8AVN9U,I am a fan of Murder She Wrote.  It is great to have this DVD series,1508803200,,68,3.25
5894818,5,B00E8AVN9U,"I grew up on ""Murder, She Wrote."" It was the thing to watch on a Sunday night, signaling the end of the week (technically, the beginning, I know, but it always felt as if the week was ending because school was the next day, the start of the week for me). Those were happy times for me, gathering around the television with my family to watch Jessica Fletcher solve yet another baffling mystery. This was simple entertainment--good stories, interesting plots, loveable recurring characters, ""exotic"" locales, and even (sometimes) nice clothes (as I'm into fashion, the wardrobe always resonated with me--as the series progressed and Angela's character gained more fame, Jessica became worldlier and her taste in clothes became chicer (is that a word?), and she sometimes wore some nice suits), especially in the fashion-industry settings.

So, when I saw that I could get the entire series (all 12 seasons) at once for less than $90, I jumped on it. This is, for all intents and purposes, my childhood. And, when I received the package, I set to viewing right away. Swoosh! I was back in time. Right now, my mother's at a nursing facility (thanks to a stroke) and my grandmother's rehabbing at the same facility for a medical issue--but, with Jessica Fletcher on the screen, I was that little girl again with my family watching this amateur sleuthess (that would be my version of the feminine form of ""sleuth"") solve another crime.

However, there was one slight problem. The boxes for seasons 2, 3, and 11 were broken. Inside the box, the DVDs are held together by a plastic divider. For these three boxes, the holder's rod or bracket was broken, leaving the DVD holder free to hang inside, loose and askew. There didn't appear to be any damage to the DVDs themselves, but, when you spend $90 on something, you don't want anything damaged. So, I shipped the entire set back. I'm waiting on a replacement. No big deal, really. Just thought I ought sound the ""alarm"" to check the interior holders--just in case.

As to packaging, what you get is a sturdy box with an open front. The back of the box, if I remember correctly, is the picture shown: of Angela Lansbury in a maroon sweater, smiling, hand to cheek, with the title of the show written above. The front of the box, of course, is where the DVD jackets are housed, seasons one through twelve. One note: This set does NOT include the four made-for-TV movies Angela Lansbury made after the series was (stupidly) cancelled. You only get seasons one through twelve. The TV movies are a separate purchase and also sold via Amazon. But, as said, if you grew up on this series, this is a must-have purchase. You won't be disappointed.",1508716800,5,2683,4.728632478632479

5894916,5,B00E8AVN9U,"Well I have only gotten into the 1st season but there are so many DVDs. The packaging is neat but I can see how some of the reviewers are confused about getting the DVDs out. Each season has 6 DVDs in the case. Several are on off-centered flip holders. To remove a disk just press in the center of the disk with one hand and pull the edges with the other. When you put it back look for where the center is (at 1st it seems to have 2-one on each side but only one sticks up) and push the DVD in - it will become second nature.
**These DVDs are of great quality and for me are replacing what I used to watch on one of the computer (TV-movie monthly services) - they discontinued Murder She Wrote and I really enjoy the mysteries and Jessica Fletcher's manner while she solves them.

It took me almost nine months but I finally got the opportunity to view every single episode of this highly entertaining series. What I enjoyed most about this series is that there is a minimum of violence and very little in the way of sexual innuendo. This is definitely a series that grandparents can enjoy with their grandkids. I found that as the series wore on the quality of the shows did not diminish one little bit.....not even in the twelfth and final season.  Angela Lansbury obviously enjoyed the role and it was fun to see how the series evolved over the years.  Like so many other people the shows that took place in Cabot Cove continue to be my favorite episodes.  If you are a fan of classic TV, detective shows, or family-friendly programming then I highly recommend ""Murder, She Wrote:  The Complete Series""  to you.  Best of all you can now purchase the entire series for less than 1/2 of the price I paid to buy them separately.",1484006400,,1183,4.713592233009709

5894955,5,B00E8AVN9U,"I frequently watched this show on regular TV, but now I can watch ""Murder, She Wrote"" whenever I want.  I love these mysteries.  Angela Lansbury is superb!",1470355200,,155,4.703703703703703
5894956,4,B00E8AVN9U,"I give the series a generous 5-Stars, but with this MURDER, SHE WROTE: THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD SET I give 4. The reason being is that I had an issue with one of the DVDs on Season 3, DVD 1. On two of the episodes the scene freezes up and you must fast-forward it to get past the frozen part. Then you have to rewind to the point just before the bad sector or the DVD will freeze up again.

I have contacted Universal multiple times through email, Twitter and Facebook and never got a response. There's a webpage from Universal that allows you to request a replacement DVD (for any of a number of titles that they have produced) but when I put in the serial number listed on the spine of the MUDRER, SHE WROTE SEASON 3 spine it doesn't take the number. It won't take the other serial number that's listed on the box for this complete series. Although it isn't necessarily a huge issue considering that there are 12 Seasons in this set with lots of DVDs, and only one was faulty, it is troublesome to know that if you have an issue with one of the discs you won't be able to get a response from Universal. And unless you have nothing but free time 24/7 without the need to sleep, more than likely you won't be able to get through the entire set within the 30-day return period either from Amazon or any other store. You'd think that with such a big corporation, and multiple titles available for home libraries, Universal would have a full time dedicated staff in charge of just this.

Another issue is with the show itself. Around Season 3 (maybe it was 2), 4, and I believe 5, there are some episodes where the show deviates from its origins. The show is supposed to center around the character ""Jessica Fletcher"" who is a widow and teacher, who finds that her knack for writing gets her a second career as a mystery writer. Everywhere she goes murder happens, but since she's such a good crime novelist and observer she discovers an uncanny ability to solve the most perfect crimes. Those shows are wonderful and charming.

However, there were more than a few episodes, some back-to-back-to-back, where ""Jessica"" breaks the fourth wall, talks to the viewer and says something along the lines of ""let me tell you about my friend...,"" which then goes onto a whole episode showing one of her friends, students, or even one of the plots of her book, and the character herself is NOT in the show. She only appears at the beginning and the end, which is not good because you're watching ""Murder, SHE Wrote,"" and you become involved with the characters like ""Fletcher,"" and the sheriff ""Amos Tupper"" (Tom Bosley), Jessica's nephew ""Grady"" (Michael Horton) and the other regulars that make-up the fictional town of ""Cabot Cover, Maine,"" and you want to see her solve the mystery in her quirky way. If the show had started that way then I guess that would be a different story but it didn't.

At first, I didn't understand what was going on (I didn't watch the show when it aired) because as I said the show was in its third season (or end of second season), so the formula of the show was already established and this was NOT the norm. It was revealed in one of the special features that Angela Lansbury wanted to quit the show after the first 2 seasons but because it was a big hit studio execs begged her to stay on. She then agreed only if she could do these ""wrap-arounds,"" appearing only at the beginning and end, that way she wouldn't have to be on set all the time. The studio agreed but after this happened for a few seasons fans started complaining in droves -- calling and writing the studio -- about this and so it was done away with. Personally, I think Lansbury wanted more money (and got it) because after that kerfuffle the shows went back to their original format, Jessica was out solving murders, and never broke that fourth wall again!

The earlier season DVDs have special featurettes on them that discuss the series etc., and also one called ""The Great 80's TV Flashback"" that features some of the great television detectives like ""Murder, She Wrote."" This set also has the crossover episode of ""Magnum P.I."" where Lansbury appeared on Tom Selleck's show and he did the same.

Anyway, MURDER, SHE WROTE, is a great show, when it stayed in its original format, and there were plenty of guest stars on it like Bill Maher, and Lansbury's Broadway co-star in ""Sweeny Todd"" Len Cariou.",1468886400,3,4393,4.5125628140703515

5894970,5,B00E8AVN9U,"Finally! The complete series all in one attractive box set! I started slowly (and painfully) collecting individual seasons of Murder, She Wrote a few months ago. I say painfully, because the individual seasons still run around $25 each depending on where you purchase them. Some even run as high as $30 or $35. Also, availability can be a barrier too, as in stores I would often run across seasons I had already purchased, but not any that I was missing. Also, the prices and availability of repacks of each season here on Amazon vary per season, and you have to be careful that if you're collecting the original box sets, that you are getting those editions, and vice versa for the repacks.

Anyway, I came across this box set and I had to snap it up immediately, as even at close to $100 (before shipping), it's still a better deal than buying them up individually, and what's more, each season is a repack, which means a better quality case.

I can't say enough about this box set. It's beautiful, high quality, and a great gift for any fan of Murder, She Wrote and/or Angela Lansbury!",1461628800,7,1088,4.574358974358974

She always has cake and coffee ready for visitors, leads the charmed life of a woman living near the beach, has a doctor boy-friend who's always available...what's not to like.  Plus she's so brilliant at solving crimes and wherever she is, it's like her karma to stumble on a fascinating murder case.

It is actually the Mendocino Coast, and Ft. Bragg Ca. that was used as the basis for the show. The best show of all time is simply the only real description anyone needs. She travels the country and the world helping to solve murders and write novels that top the best-seller lists everywhere. I am now happily watching all of these gems again and I am very pleased to say that the quality of the video is first rate. It is 5 stars for the whole presentation. I also love the fact that James Dean was hanging out on the same street that J. B. lived on there (Mendocino) while ""East of Eden"" was being filmed. Some amazing acting and very deep plots make this show a stand-out and will draw you in.",1425600000,2,856,4.290123456790123

5895077,1,B00E8AVN9U,"The Modern Universal Logo intro is 25 seconds long. It plays when you insert the disc and at the start of every episode and you can not skip it. That means that by the end of the box set you're going to have watched the intro about 300 times, totaling about one and a half hours. And that does not include all the warning messages. I think that is totally outrageous and annoying. Other have complained about forced commercials on other discs. I'd rather watch it on TV. The universal logo is at the end and it's the older, quieter version. Corporate greed and stupidity shouldn't be rewarded.",1424822400,14,593,4.5

I can watch the series when I want without having to wait for it to come on TV.  I love the series and find I pick apart the episodes to see if I can figure out the whodunit myself on episodes I haven't seen yet.  This is by far one of the best series that ever came on TV.  There are no fancy spy gadgets used, no martial arts scenes where if it were real life, that they'd be in traction for 6 months, just good old fashioned logic and common sense.

5895134,5,B00E8AVN9U,"Wonderful show, great product, incredibly fast shipping overseas (I live in the UK). I could sing the praises of Angela Lansbury until the cows come home, and it wouldn't be enough. She's wonderful, charming, and manages to not only make Jessica Fletcher likeable, but also humane. Over 250 episodes of one thing could have easily become tiresome, but even though the plots are fairly standard, she draws one in, and is, to me, the main reason to keep revisiting the series, and, of course, Cabot Cove.

Was very pleased with the boxset as well: individual disks, nothing double sided (they tend to be bothersome), beautiful box to keep them all tidy and neat.

However, I do have one gripe: I bought this just before Black Friday, for around $75. Two days later it rocketed to $97. At the time I bought it, I was apparently saving around $100. If I bought it now I'd save the same. Amazon drives the ""original"" prices up in order to make one think one's saving, when in fact that isn't so. It's a shame, really, and should be illegal. If I had anywhere else I could have bought this from, I would have. The five stars are definitely for the show, and not for Amazon's practices.",1418947200,,1179,4.556603773584905

Get it together Amazon....you wouldn't let me write a review--just rate the show which I did give a 5 star...I love Murder She Wrote! You give no options to get help when a person has trouble leaving a review.  Most of my purchases are based on the reviews I read...this is important to me and other people who shop on line.

The only negative thing I have to say is that the quality of each episode can vary from season to season which is annoying. There is also next to no special features on the discs. From season to season, also it seems like different companies copied the video. It almost had the feeling of a bootleg. I bought it on sale so I am pleased with the price and what I got but for the regular price I would have expected more special features and less copied feeling on the discs.

This set is fantastic. This is one of the best examples of classic procedural television that I can think of. This complete set is exactly what you want if you are a fan of the series.

Discs

This set itself contains only the single sided discs. This is fantastic if you consider the fact that many movies/shows suffer from poorly created double sided discs.

The entire set has 63 discs containing 263 episodes. That is quite a lot of crime solving

Packaging

This packaging is very slim. The entire set takes up about as much space as the first four individual seasons.

Do you need this?

If you are in the market for some Angela Landsbury goodness then you should consider your options. If you have none of the previous seasons then you probably want this complete set. It will definitely be your best deal. If you own some or most of the individual seasons you might want to just update the single seasons that have the higher quality discs. This may be a more cost effective measure.

Extras

You won't find any extras that weren't already present in previous sets. This is nice of them seeing as how completion it's won't be pressured into buying this fir added content.

Unfortunately, you won't be getting the TV movies that were created. This is a small complaint as they can easily be purchased separately.

The extras include

The Great 80s Flashback; Origin of a Series; Recipe for a Hit; America's Top Sleuths; The Perils of Success, and the Magnum, P.I. crossover episode.

This is a great set and if you are considering purchasing it I don't think that you will be disappointed. This is a great value for a quality product all in compact packaging.",1384214400,104,1684,4.626262626262626

You can tell they didn't skimp when pulling together the casing or actual DVDs, which was a really pleasant surprise. The set of 12 will fit nicely in my DVD case too.

Another note - this doesn't include the four Murder She Wrote movies but I already have that separately. Sold on Amazon for less than $20.

At the current price of $100, this is a GREAT value and would make a great holiday gift for someone special in your life.",1383868800,72,706,4.2611940298507465

5895273,5,B00E8AVN9U,"Received my ""Murder, She Wrote: The Complete Series"" yesterday. I love this set! I was one of those people who purchased all of the individual sets as they came out but I knew if there was ever a day where a complete set came out I'd get it. The series itself is timeless. I used to watch this series with my Grandmother back when it originally aired on CBS. I loved it then and I love it now!

As for the Complete set itself. It's beautifully put together. All 12 seasons are up together in a box that is just the right size for my book shelves. The box set has the slimmer DVD packages rather than the bulky sets when the series was originally put out on DVD. One thing I really like is that there are no double sided DVD's in this set! This is a major improvement from the first 3 seasons put out years ago where they were double sided and I would have some digital issues from time to time with those sets. So again...I love this set!!!

Some have complained about the movies not being included in the set. I'm personally OK with this. The movies had a different feel from the series and it really doesn't bother me to have the movies in a separate case.

So...should you get this set? I say if you are a MSW fan...then yes. It's smaller and it's a quality set! And the price isn't extremely bad either compared to other complete series.",1380931200,273,1341,4.23046875

Still, this is a fantastic box set and it's like going back in a time machine to the 1980's and 1990's (when it originally aired on TV).  The mysteries are great, Jessica is lovable and it's fun to see all the golden age Hollywood guests stars and future stars (George Clooney, etc) who made guest appearances.  It's easy to see why this was a top ten Nielsen-rated  show for over a decade... the mysteries are fun, family-friendly, and some are as scary as a 80's slasher movie ie episodes: ""Crossed Up, Snow White Blood Red, Paint Me A Murder, Reflections Of The Mind, etc.""  Awesome value for a box set and contains all 264 TV episodes.  The 4 TV movies which followed after the series are sold separately.",1529798400,,816,4.370860927152318

Trying to decide if binge-watching all the seasons, then replacing the defective discs is worth it, or to simply replace the entire box. Terribly disappointed, I love the show.",1529625600,,262,5.116279069767442
