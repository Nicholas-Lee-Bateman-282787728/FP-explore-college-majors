8219461,1,B000A345CQ,"I watched about half of this movie on Amazon Prime (or maybe it was Netflix; I don't remember) with my children before wising up and cutting it off. It indoctrinates your kids to be anarchists, insinuating that all rules and rule-makers are bad/insane and the freedom to do *whatever you want* without regard to consequences is ideal. Not family- or civics-friendly; no thank you.",1423180800,,380,4.953125

8219463,4,B000A345CQ,"""Frosty the Snowman"" is a classic Christmas special that I can remember watching when I was a young boy. My wife remembers watching this classic as well.  Now we can enjoy watching this with our children whenever we want during the Christmas season and not worry about ""What time is Frosty on this year?""  The other two episodes were a bonus. But I really bought this for the original.",1264982400,5,385,4.565217391304348
8219464,1,B000A345CQ,"This sequel is nothing less than a Marxist indoctrination video in the guise of chidren's entertainment.

Essentially, an evil old white man corporatist invents an spray can that eliminates snow because snow is inconvenient. Even the local children hate snow, except for the class egghead and a little girl who befriends Frosty. Frosty suggests a ""winter carnival"" to help the people appreciate the season & the snow. The evil old white man comes back with a truck that sprays the chemical everywhere. The lone woman on his company's board of directors speaks up about the environment and she is KILLED. All the while the megalomaniacle evil old white man is seeking more & more power by destroying the environment.

Note that nowhere in this video is there any mention of Christmas, nor are there any Christmas decorations. It's the ""winter"" carnival and the ""winter"" season, etc. Those running the corporation are evil old white men hell-bent on power and the destruction of the environment at all costs (power & capitalism = environmental destruction), the townspeople are gullible brainless nothings who can't see beyond their own arm's reach and swallow whatever they're told so long as it's corporate propaganda, and the only people who have a clue about what's going on are the ""children"" and the brainiac bookworms.

On top of that it has zero entertainment value or humor, the songs are totally pointless, it's boring as hell because it's so preachy, and the animation is simply cheap & cheesey. It's awful. All in all, this is SICK. Simply and totally sick. If you have this in your child's DVD collection, do yourself and your child a favor and THROW IT OUT!",1259280000,7,1669,4.932384341637011
8219465,5,B000A345CQ,"A thoroughly enjoyable ride from start to finish. Full of charm and wit, this movie should have broad appeal. Numerous unpredictable turns eventually lead to a heartwarming ending.",1131062400,9,180,5.464285714285714
