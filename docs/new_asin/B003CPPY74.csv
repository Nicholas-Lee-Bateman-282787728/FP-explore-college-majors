4110039,2,B003CPPY74,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I must give the makers credit for putting a new spin on the vampire film: in this one, the vampires have already taken over and we are shown what a world with them as the majority would be like (I particularly liked the ad for whitening toothpaste and the smoking preteens). It glosses over how it happened, as that is not really relevant, and gets on with showing us this new world.

For the most part, we see the world through the eyes of Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) a vampire who is a blood doctor working on a substitute for human blood for his fellow vampires to feed on. You see, with the majority of the world now vampire, and with the remaining humans doing their best not to be the next meal, human blood supply is rapidly diminishing. But while he may be working on a way to save his fellow vampires, he does not enjoy his existence; he does not feed on humans, choosing to feed on animals. But the chance for change occurs when he runs--almost literally--into the human resistance and they give him an opportunity to work on what he really wants, which is to find a cure for vampirism. And change he does, finding a cure in a rather unique way (more kudos to the makers on the originality of it).

But therein lies the problem with this film; in my opinion, for a film to be truly good, the protagonist must undergo a change, that the person he was at the beginning is not the same person at the end. Yes, he does change, but only physically; psychologically, he is already where he needs to be, and so now he only needs to bring his body over. I think a psychological change is much more dramatic and ultimately satisfying.

So while I give the makers kudos for the originality and detail of this vampiric world, they missed out on a chance to make something truly great.",1264982400,2,1825,4.374631268436578
4110040,4,B003CPPY74,its diffrent than most vampire movies you see which is what i liked about it but it wasn't nothing special its a movie that is pretty good and watchable but one time is enough for me.,1264982400,,183,4.111111111111111
4110041,3,B003CPPY74,"Daybreakers is a different type of vampire movie. Different from the likes of Twilight's and Underworld's of the world. The writers and directors were trying to create a new type of vampire movie. It's been done before in Japan with a anime series called Trinity Blood. They both wanted to go into a new direction with vampire lore, but just like Trinity Blood Daybreakers ultimately fails.

The story has a unique twist with vampires coming about through disease and who knows I don't think any movie has really gone into the origins of vampires. It really did start out great, and I was hoping it would continue that way. Sadly I guess the directors and writers wanted to add pointless violence. Now don't get me wrong I don't mind it, as long as it adds something to the story. Sadly I'd say half of the stuff they did in the movie was pointless and had no meaning. It took a great deal away from the story and characters. If they concentrated less on exploding bodies and more on the story and characters I truly believe this movie could have changed vampire movies in the future.

The acting from the lead actors, Ethan Hawk, Sam Neil, Willem Dafoe, and Claudia Karvan was really well done. The problem was the directing and like I said above, they took pointless minutes of screen time to show pointless violence and took away a lot from these really good actors and interesting characters. These good actors were just wasted.

The worst part of the movie had to be the directing and writing which interestingly enough was done by the same brothers. Writing was they really had something here, but their directing really go in the way. Maybe these brothers should stick to being writers.

Overall Daybreakers is just a average vampire movie with a interesting story, good actors and decent visuals but was bogged down by bad directing and pointless violence. I was entertained, so this movie is worth renting for a few bucks.",1264377600,,1931,4.687315634218289
4110042,2,B003CPPY74,"There are flashes of Daybreakers that if taken out of the context of the film as a whole would not only be interesting, but might actually make me sure I was watching at the very least an aesthetically pleasing film.  I find movies like Evil Dead 2 to be aesthetically pleasing, so it's really not a stretch.  When I first heard about Daybreakers I thought the concept was far-fetched but now that I've seen it, I actually thought that was one of the film's strengths, along with the always game consummate professional Ethan Hawke.  Hawke either thought he was in a blockbuster that was sure to transform into some kind of action vampire franchise, or he just went all out to show that even when in an irresponsible and callow film like Daybreakers, he can still get the job done.  The other cast members, including Sam Neil and Willem Dafoe, were either lifeless mannequins watching their resumes get scarred up or they just took the campiness to another level.  Sam Neil reveled in his role as the film's villain.  He dressed evil, his tone was evil, his hair was slick and vile, his smile was sinister, and his actions were very very naughty; but yet he delivered his dialogue like senna delivers dead bacteria from your lower intestine.  Furthermore, Willem Dafoe was actually worse, probably because he got the brunt of the film's worst lines, and despite being in all-out tongue-in-cheek mode, even a great actor like Dafoe will struggle in being sincere with lines like ""we're the folks with the crossbows!"" and ""f*** it, let's have a barbecue"", among others.

Anyway, so Daybreakers takes place about ten years into the future.  The world has been taken over by vampires and the vampires can't figure out a way to sustain blood for their starving population as the human population dwindles.  Oh yeah, like our whole reliance on oil!  I get it!  Listen, if you want an insight on peak oil I suggest you read about it.  The idea is original and somewhat interesting, after all I love a good vampire movie but I love a good dystopian setting even more.  However, despite a decent concept, the screenplay was bad enough that it extended to not only making dialogue unbelievable and unlikely, but also the film's entire arc disregarded far too many details to ignore.  The action scenes were silly as well, especially when considering the action films that have come out over the last few years by comparison.  Oh, and if you're rating this on the standard of horror films, then I guess you've got your funny gore, but even that did not work toward making me forgive the film's many flaws.  Besides, the gore and fire and what not was assisted with some very obvious CGI.  One thing I can say, the starving vampires were pretty cool.

Sure to be one of the film's most praised strengths is its visual style.  It is a dark futuristic vampire yarn that takes place in a matrix movie after all, so yeah, it looks pretty rad if you're twelve.  Saying that the film's visual style is unoriginal is itself a tired and hackneyed point hardly even worth making.  The music is techno metal garbage that only says one thing about the mood in each varied scene; and that's ""vampires, gore, and fire will get you pumped!"".  Did I enjoy watching Daybreakers?  Of course I did, it was a fun and gory, albeit stupid, ride; but there is no way I can recommend it.",1263686400,3,3352,4.632825719120135
4110043,4,B003CPPY74,"The year is 2019. Vampires make up most of the world's population, humanity having been transformed after from an epidemic that started ten years earlier. Any remaining humans are hunted and, if caught, are taken to corporations that harvest their blood. These corporations need all the help they can get; because so few humans are left, blood is in short supply, and when a vampire has no access to human blood, they mutate into violent winged beasts with virtually no mental capabilities. Pharmaceutical companies, like the one run by Charles Bromley (Sam Neill), have been trying to develop a synthetic blood substitute with little to no success. Bromley's chief hematologist, Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke), is well aware that if humans go extinct, vampires will suffer the same fate. It's not about creating a substitute - it's about finding a cure.

""Daybreakers"" will never be considered a great film, but as a futuristic vampire thriller, it holds its own and manages to be entertaining. I admit, though, that I didn't get much out of the action or the gore, both of which are plentiful during the last ten minutes. It just felt so pedestrian, so derivative, so detracting from the intriguing plot, which is essentially a fable about overpopulation, the exploitation and wasting of natural resources, and the idea that many find complacency easier than working towards change.

Before long, Edward meets Audrey (Claudia Karvan), a surviving human and the leader of a resistance movement dedicated to finding that elusive vampire cure. Success depends on Edward, who in turn depends on a wisecracking, car-loving group member named Lionel Cormac, a.k.a. Elvis (Willem Defoe). Why he depends on him, I leave to you to find out. Let it suffice to say that Elvis knows a thing or two about vampires. Anyway, this resistance is mostly human, but a few non-humans are also taking part, and I find this fascinating.

Subplots involving Edward's brother, Frankie (Michael Dorman), and Bromley's still-human daughter, Alison (Isabel Lucas), add some emotional weight. Frankie in particular is a complex character, torn between his life as a vampire soldier and his love for Edward, which probably hasn't been expressed in quite some time. Convention requires that Frankie remains angry and distant until right before the end of the film, at which point he finally shows his true feelings for his brother. Yes, convention requires, but it works just the same. As for Alison, she isn't given as much screen time, although I think we learn everything we need to know, especially during those tense couple of scenes involving her father. Indeed, it is an experience having a conversation with him; everything about him suggests deceit and menace, from his perpetually sinister tone of voice to his piercing eyes, which you'd swear could turn you to stone.

When it comes to supporting players, the real disappointment is Audrey. While certainly not a bad character, she is an unnecessary one, adding so little to the story that it seems she was included only out of necessity for a sidekick. Surely you know that all movies like this have sidekicks. Elvis is a little better, but not much; his jokey dialogue is unbelievably bad, and it's made worse by an exaggerated Southern accent that does little more than reinforce a stereotype. It's a good thing this character is vital to the plot. Otherwise, I suspect he'd get tiresome much earlier on, like during his first scene.

To be fair, most of the movie works just fine. Hawke and Neill give decent performances - about as decent as a vampire film will let them be, anyway. I also enjoyed the visuals; in this future world, vampires have been clever to develop high tech methods of avoiding exposure to the sun, such as underground walkways and cars equipped with UV-blocking panels (they have to rely on projected camera images to see the road). In the absence of sunlight, their world is a drab, muted landscape of blue and gray tones.

Here's the bottom line: ""Daybreakers"" is an adequate movie, a fun way to spend nearly 100 minutes away from home. But given the fact that it's also a fable, I guess I was hoping it would go a little farther. Maybe it's gotten to the point where elaborate fight scenes and messy shots of exploding vampires should no longer be obligatory. Writers/directors Michael and Peter Spierig should have delved deeper into the allegory. What more could have been drawn from the world we live in today?  What about the economy? Class? Education? Government? The last one especially, since it's safe to assume there was a functioning system before the vampire epidemic and that it was drastically altered afterwards. And it must have a hand in both the harvesting of blood and the funding of its synthetic substitute. Too bad none of this is explored.",1263686400,,4822,4.945679012345679
4110044,4,B003CPPY74,"Daybreakers is a breath of fresh air in the world of vampire cinema that currently consists of the Twilight series of films. I have nothing against these films, I just prefer my vampires to be badass and blood-thirsty, while maintaining that aura of supernatural coolness  la Christopher Lee in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horror-of-Dracula/dp/B00006G8K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horror of Dracula</a>. Daybreakers initially looked bland and forgettable to me, but to my surprise the film manages to pull off being enjoyable as well as bringing a few new ideas to the vampire genre. The film is not groundbreaking in any way, but it is a fun time and (for me) it made vampires cool again.

To start off, the casting is good. I don't personally care for Ethan Hawke, but he works here just fine delivering a satisfactory performance. The real standouts are Sam Neill as Hawke's boss and Willem Dafoe as a kick-ass vampire hunter with a taste for muscle cars, high-tech crossbows, and Elvis Presley. The supporting cast is made up of mostly unknowns and they turn in decent performances. The direction by the Speirig Brothers is above-average, but nothing spectacular. It's a relief to see a horror film that doesn't have that ridiculous shaky-cam thing going on. The action scenes are well-directed as well, with an unexpected car chase happening about halfway through. I must say that the cinematography is excellent, with lots of dark blues and grays in the vampire scenes and dry browns and yellows in the human scenes. It reminded me of the cinematography in the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade/dp/0780624890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade</a>. Again, nothing new but it is a visually pleasing film.

The story itself is nothing amazing, but it's executed quite well. It is, however, interesting from both a horror and sci-fi standpoint, utilizing both genres for maximum effectiveness. As a horror film, it does well with a few scares and lots of blood and gore (another surprise for me, but I'll get to that in a minute). However, it really shines as a science-fiction film. The idea of a shortage of blood causing the vampires to panic is an interesting role reversal that I found quite amusing. It also has overtones of greedy multi-national corporations only in it to make a profit (gleefully reminding me of the Weyland-Yutani company from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>). There are some nifty new ideas that also made the film feel like a welcome addition to the sci-fi/horror genre. I really don't want to spoil them, so I'll be careful with my choice of words. The vampires have adjusted their way of living to not be hampered by that pesky sunlight. This is done both outright and subtly, the latter of which I found myself chuckling at the filmmaker's ingenuity. Other interesting ideas include the cure itself (which I initially scoffed at, but the more I thought about it I realized in the context of the story, it works) and the concept of what happens to a malnourished vampire that doesn't get regular servings of blood. Does it die? You'll get the answer in Daybreakers. There is also a nice Romero-style commentary on some current social and economic issues, that works well and doesn't get too preachy.

The special effects are well-done. The CGI is nothing special, though the vampires exploding after being staked was pretty cool. However, there are tons of live-acion gore effects that I was very happy to see considering the industry's current obsession with CGI. It was nice to see some&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-the-Dead/dp/B00008G8L9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of the Dead</a>-style gore happening in the modern age; and if this comment doesn't make it clear, let me spell it out for you: this film is VERY gory. There's a lot of blood, guts and body parts flying around (one bit early on actually made me jump - something that usually never happens) so be warned. It's not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Alive/dp/157362408X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Alive</a>&nbsp;or anything, but it is pretty heavy on the red stuff! Gorehounds (myself included) will not be disappointed.

Any complaints? Not really. I originally wanted Willem Dafoe to be more badass, spouting one-liners and such, but he didn't reach that level of true ""badass-ness"" like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-McClane/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John McClane</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arnold/dp/B00004TRD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arnold</a>&nbsp;or Woody Harrelson's character did in the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland/dp/B002WY65W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland</a>. In retrospect, I realized that this may have messed with the tone of the film so it was probably for the best. The film ended quite abruptly too. Is it too much to ask for a minute of wrap-up? But hey, neither of these make the film any less of a good time.

So, bottom line: I would whole-heartedly recommend this one to any sci-fi/horror fans. It's nothing you haven't seen before, but it's executed in a stylish and interesting manner so you'll definitely enjoy it.",1263254400,97,5673,6.138539042821159
4110045,3,B003CPPY74,"The idea behind Daybreakers is neat and there are some very memorable gore scenes, but the script is lacking a clear direction or clever dialogue of any kind. Vampires run everything and account for 95% of the population, so guess what that means? That's right, there's not enough blood to go around in order to keep the vampires from turning really ugly and dying of starvation. Did it ever occur to them to force us to make babies or simply make them in a lab long before our numbers got so low? The cast features some talented big names in Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill, but even they seem too good for this material. They deserve much better. I was hoping to get something at least on par with the Underworld series, but this one doesn't even reach that level. Some of the CGI looked terrible, but I did appreciate the apparent use of practical effects majority of the time. The gore was well done and caught me a bit by surprise. I didn't expect zombie flick level kills in a vampire movie.

The initial half hour or so had me intrigued, but it was all downhill from there. It felt much longer than 90 minutes, even though it seemed that it was cut to death in the editing room. If they could have found a good balance of pacing, character development and action, this film could have been very good, but as it is, wait for Daybreakers to fizzle it's way to DVD.

If you want to see what happens when incredibly stupid people are given a boatload of money and a handful of almost has-been actors and told to make a movie while high on crack, this is it.  The two numbskulls behind this -- the pretentiously self-styled ""The Spierig Brothers"" -- should be forced to spend a week in a tank filled with bulldog ants as punishment for this rancid, insipid, and pathetic mess.

4110060,3,B003CPPY74,"Pros:
Intriguing set up and established. The laws of the world/world-building was good enough. Nice action. Shot very well, good acting/casting, flowing plot with logical outcomes, etc. Good special effects (If you are squeemish about blood or gore, skip it.)

Cons:
My first immediate qualm was the very near-future setting. If there was a little more explanation on how 7+ billion people could become vampires in just a matter of ten years to the point the human blood supply is drying out, it would've fit. However, because little explanation for that was given, the close date (even if you saw this in 2010) seems unnecessary. The year could've been 3018 and it wouldn't have made much of a difference.

That aside, the story itself could've added a little more depth. The opening scene has little to no connection with the story. You only get little hints and things which never fully come together or even matter. I can understand if it's used to set the tone and introduce the audience to the mindset of the people/vampires, but why throw hints hearkening back to it later? This layer of the plot seems like an afterthought to give more ""Wooooo everything's connecteddddd"", and it feels half-assed.

The ending is okay, but still leaves questions answered. A post-modern setting where humanity and the value of humanity itself are questioned opens up a huge philosophical playground, and while the dialogue/plot attempted to illustrate something, it would always pull back when a good point could be made. I feel like if they dug a little deeper with it, characterization, theme, etc could've been a lot stronger and made a fantastic movie.

Also, the little monologue/voiceovers at pivotal points didn't expand the theme. It kept things in the frame of the fictional characters and setting: humans vs vampires hoopla. When usually, pivotal voiceovers like that drive a message home that could translate to the audience members and apply to real life, at least a little. It basically ends with a message with (spoiler alert): ""The humans will always win against vampires because we have humanity."" Which is okay, I guess, but it's something everyone knows because vampires don't exist. Where's the point of this movie? Entertainment? Action? Then why attempt to send off with a deep message?

Ultimately, I give it 3 stars. I love the concept, look and feel of the movie. It fully immerses you into a fantastical future world with danger and vampires. If you're looking for an action-packed movie with vampires, darkness, and blood, this is a good one. 5 stars. However, if you're look for something with a little more depth and meaning (like say, Interview with a Vampire), I suggest looking somewhere else.",1523923200,,2715,4.984547461368654

I was really intrigued by the idea of the movie and I'd welcome a redo of the same plot with a much bigger budget, potentially larger cast and a relatively larger landscape.  It's a great movie idea, wasted by budgeting constraints, a lackluster script and mediocre acting at times.  I should point out the ladder once again: The acting is so grossly mediocre that it's surprising some of it landed on screen.  The scenes between Neil and the daughter are so laughably bad that it made me want to cringe.

It's a good flick to watch if you're definitely intrigued by the concept (and trust me, it's an INCREDIBLY awesome idea to put on screen), but the delivery is lackluster.

It's a cut above the Wesley Snipe's ""Blade series"" of films.  Great cast.  If Wes had not ticked Hollyweird, this could have been Blade 4.  But instead, the vampire legend has a talked about before twist and some interesting paths to follow if you can take a leap of movie faith.

4110078,2,B003CPPY74,"Well... A vampire movie with three palatable stars. I'm afraid that's the highlight of this  film. Ethan Hawke looked handsome as a Vampire, though the only thing they changed to knight him a vampire was his contact lenses and a hint more on his K9 teeth. Same with Sam Neil. Neither seemed to suffer any real transition. William DaFoe perfected and adopted the grizzled, intelligent,  but a bit nutty,"" Heroin-chic"" Vampire look permanently, during Nosferatu decades ago. The theme is the worn out, real life, idea of providing the market with a manufactured product providing an added bonus of a built in guarantee of addiction that applies to every product made in this world. Creepy, unethical, but nothing new or only occurs to companies after being drained of blood...or maybe I'm wrong!!  I still can't figure out why a Vampire who typically hangs out in pest infected digs, can't eat, drink, wash his meals off his face and must smell like open sores dripping on everything and spits grossness out when he talks, somehow puts on a suit and a British Accent and all the humans trust him to do scientific research. ( Why didn't humans do that BEFORE the Vampires all became scientists?)  How the Vampire Police storm a home without an invite?  I wish they'd all have the same rules. I recall one where the pale female vampire could go outside naked during the day as long as she wore a big floppy red hat.",1521676800,,1411,4.696356275303644

Everyone just walked through their parts and there was no energy to it. The scenes with the vampires suffering and regressing were great but not much else was happening in between. There was a neat twist to it but there just wasn't enough energy to it and definitely not enough of the bad vampires and if there was a blood problem youd expect there to be a little more sense of urgency to the whole thing. This could have been really good if everyone had some adrenalin flowing. Rating this with some of the best vampire movies is more than a stretch.,1519430400,4,683,4.3858267716535435

Vampires have all but taken over the world in the not-too-distant future (2019, believe it or not), but they are running out of fresh human blood, with only a tiny percentage of the world's population remaining who are human.  Is there a sufficient substitute for the blood?  But, more importantly, is it possible to become human again after you've already gone over to the other side?

I just wish it had more time to do character development and set up the atmosphere.  Other than that it was actually good for what they were working with. The twist, which I won't spoil for you, was clever. The action had more of a military feel to it then super natural vampires going at it. Even the subsiders were lame.

4110210,4,B003CPPY74,"A surprisingly well thought through vampire story. While it's entirely too violent to re-watch and re-watch, the fact it cloaks Vampirism more as an infection requiring scientific analysis and steps through the analysis more from a mystery angle is what makes it very unique. There's a rigor in studying it and it's less mystical. Also a heavy portion of the movie is the civil dynamics of worldwide Vampirism and the effects of sudden wrinkles added to that society. All in all, it was a pretty awesome what-if type movie that a Philosophy class can easily burn a couple classes discussing. The excessive violences is the only reason I gave it four stars. No version of this movie could be PG-13 because it would've had less of an impact. But violence-wise it's a pretty hard-R.",1439596800,,779,4.82089552238806

The world has been infected by a vampire virus and most of the humans have turned into vampires. A few humans remain, in fact too few to feed the vampire population.

Ethan Hawke plays a vampire scientist working for a drug company run by Sam Neill. Hawke is working on making fake blood to try and feed the vampires. But, alas the fake blood does not work.

Hawke somehow gets involved with a human resistance group that has discovered a cure for vampirism, and cures himself. he then learns that the company he works for does not want a cure, but just a way to keep selling stuff that people (or vampires) will need just to survive.

There is some silly stuff in the movie, along with some blood and gore for those that like blood and gore. I can't say it is a great movie, but as a way to pass time, it was OK.",1432684800,,926,4.214689265536723

4110247,4,B003CPPY74,"More often than not, when Ethan Hawke stars in a film, I enjoy both the film and his performance. Yet, for some reason I find he has the air of a smarmy prick. Maybe that's just part of the characters he's played over the years. I will say, however, that by the time this movie ended, I quite liked his character--and by proxy, him as well.

In the year 2019, humanity is nearly a decade into its existence after much of it is turned into vampires. It's a bit vague as to how it happened--something like a virus caused the initial outbreak--but the end result in a world much like our own, but with vampires running the show and humans are basically hunted down like wild game and farmed for their blood. Now we know how the KFC chickens feel.

Humans are a finite resource, and you might say the world has long passed ""peak blood"" as only 5% of the human population remains, and synthetic blood substitutes aren't exactly panning out yet. That's where Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) comes in. He's one of the scientists researching a possible blood substitute, and since being turned into a vampire all those years ago, he's been having a bit of a hard go of assimilating into the vampire lifestyle. He has an aversion to drinking human blood, but they've discovered through grizzly observation that blood deprivation is, shall way say, less than pleasant for their species.

Enter Elvis (Willem Dafoe), a strange human who claims he used to be a vampire but was miraculously cured. Aided by a ragtag crew of humans on the run, Elvis enlists Edward to help replicate the circumstances that led to his being cured of vampirism, and hopefully cure the rest of the planet as well before all vampires degrade into a ravenous mutated horde.

As a vampire film, this movie really tries to set itself apart--at least in terms of subject matter. The gothic and graceful vampire is a veneer really, as they behave just like they did when they were human, or rather mimic their former lives while consumed by the constant craving for blood. The scenes involving the little coffee/blood shop down the street from Edward's laboratory worked quite well in making that connection between man's past and the vampire's present.

As far as the casting is concerned, it's just about pitch perfect, though it really feels at times that the main players are there to revamp old roles they've been known for. Ethan Hawke has that twitchy brooding thing that he worked so well in films like Gattica and Training Day, while Sam Neill is his same immortally creepy self as the CEO of the labs and lead villain--think a vampire version of his role in Event Horizon. And Willem Dafoe ... Well, it's Willem Dafoe. Isabel Lucas is the unfamiliar face among the cast as the human Ethan Hawke meets through an abrupt, and albeit artificial, happenstance that leads him on his way to searching for a cure. She does a good job with the role she's given, but most of the time it feels like she's there simply to act as a go-between for Ethan Hawke's character between his ordeals as a vampire and longing to regain his humanity.

There's an interesting subplot involving Sam Neill's character and an estranged daughter who has rejected him in the wake of his turning into a vampire--a turn which cured him of cancer, but ultimately turned him into a monster in his daughter's eyes. It's a flagrant bit of pathos, but without all that emoting and melancholy sprinkled throughout the story, the movie would regrettably fall apart and wind up as just another ruthless vampire B-movie.

The ending, while intense, left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I think that's because it, like District 9, abandoned the more cerebral elements of the story in favor of becoming a kind of run-and-gun climax. All things considered though, Daybreakers is a refreshing and welcome addition to vampire lore. I just hope they don't sully it by coming out with a sequel at some point, because this movie stands on its own and needs no follow-up.",1421193600,,3991,4.676638176638177

4110254,1,B003CPPY74,"Not really a spoiler here but be on alert if you consider mention of predictability to be a spoiler, though that might make my spoiler warning a bit of a spoiler too. Sorry.....

This film builds steadily to a clear and predictable ending. That having been said, I was stunned to see, during the final moments, where that ending should have been, they placed an oddly aftermarket sounding voice over and a random shot that was so inconsequential I can honestly say it neither added to, nor subtracted from, the film as a whole. In other words, they skipped the ending.

To put it another way, they didn't bother to actually put an ending onto the film. At first, I thought, perhaps there was a problem with my copy, then wondered if, possibly, there were two editions and this was a cut and, then, remembering there was a commentary track on the disc (thank you to whoever put a commentary track on this disc), I skipped through to the part (of the commentary, not the film, which happens to overlap the end of the movie) where the man in charge says they RAN OUT OF MONEY so they COULDN'T AFFORD TO FILM THE ENDING!

And holy crap.... They actually ran out of money to film the end of their film and, somehow, it never occurred to them how cheap it would have been to film one shot of the lead actor doing something (I'll let you figure out what that would be) with some blood (I'll let you figure out why) in a standing set (won't say which one) they had standing, right there, still standing, in their studio, to use, any old time they wanted, up through the last day of filming.

For this reason, this film is not worth watching. I know it may seem harsh, but, if a film doesn't actually have an ending, it doesn't have a story and, if it doesn't have a story, it isn't worth watching. Please don't waste your time on this. You've only got so much of it. That having been said, if you've seen it and you love it, I wish I could have gotten through that lack of an ending without having that single failing destroy the entire film for me. It wasn't bad up through that point. It just died in the telling of it... because they never got to tell it.",1414713600,6,2150,4.314356435643564
4110255,4,B003CPPY74,"Although a future-based vampire film, this movie is really a 'film noir' piece.  The sets are lavish, the colors slightly disturbing to help convey this dark new world, but it moves at a slower pace than such more recent films like Underworld or similar franchises.  As the film progresses, however, it picks up tempo and manages to engage the viewer.  Although vampires live in this world, this not really a vampire film.  It is about insufficient resources and the pursuit of technology to save the world in which these creatures live.  In some ways, it feels like a WWII film where humans are fleeing from Nazi oppression, finding a sympathetic ally in Ethan Hawke's vampire character.  There were many interesting technological and visual aspects of the film which made it fun to watch, but even for a fan of dark, suspense-paced films, it needed a faster tempo to earn a higher rating than four.  .",1413072000,2,903,4.787096774193548

4110289,4,B003CPPY74,"Daybreakers(released Sept/09)stars,among others,Ethan Hawke,Willem Dafoe,Claudia Karvan,Michael Dorman,Sam Neill and Jay Laga'aia. This film is a pretty good vampire flick, with a nice twist. In this one the vampires,instead of being a sub class living amongst humans,are actually the dominant species. The story deals with their long term attempts at survival. And speaking of which,let's look at that.
The story finds Hawke as a blood specialist working for a pharmaceutical company run by Neill. Vampires now rule the earth with the remaining human population dwindled down to a small percentage. Because of the lack of humans from which to feed off of,the blood supply is dangerously low and getting lower everyday,as we witness vamps lining up to drink fluids that go from 20% human blood content,down to 5%.Another side effect to this shortage is that vamps who cannot afford to pay the ever rising high price,are turning back into unthinking savages(subsiders) who will prey even on their own kind. The company is bound to be the first to come up with a blood substitute.
Hawke is technically a vamp but he has never been comfortable in his own skin. On the way home from work one night he almost gets into an accident with another vehicle. It contains humans,which Hawke hustles into his own car as the police show up. After they leave the humans depart,but not without knowing his name and place of work.
Hawke's own brother is a vamp also,the one in fact that turned Hawke in the first place. He works for the military and later that night he returns from duty with a bottle of pure human blood which Hawke refuses to ingest. After a brief argument the two are confronted by a subsider, who used to be Hawke's  gardener. After a close encounter they manage to kill it. Next morning one of the passengers he previously saved from the cops(Karvan)enters his house and leaves instructions for a meeting at a specific destination out of town.
Hawke drives to the location specified and meets up with Karvan and ""Elvis""(Defoe).Before they can get the preliminaries over with Hawkes own brother shows up and tries to take them all in. Just then an army truck is seen heading their way. They overcome Hawke's brother and escape in Hawke's car. Once they are safely away Defoe relates his story that he was once a vamp also. One day while driving along and not paying attention to the road he slammed into a barrier at a river's edge and went flying out the car's windshield. He immediately caught on fire from the sun,landing in the river and into a culvert. He soon realized he had been cured somehow through his ordeal. That is why they approached Hawke, in order to enlist his help. Hawke readily agrees.
He is taken to a deserted vineyard owned by Karan's parents. There it is discovered that they need to control the burning process in order to effect a cure. Hawke agrees to become the guinea pig,with Karan and Defoe's help. Inside a jury rigged fermenter,Hawke indeed becomes human once more. Before the military can arrive to capture the three,they flee the scene.
Hawke gets an idea to return to the house of a friend, who he worked with for years at the pharma company to create a blood substitute. They do so and try to enlist his help. The friend takes a phone call and goes into a bedroom for privacy. After a while they realize he has called his office and Karan has been captured. Hawke and Defoe barely escape capture and flee.
While hiding out Hawke's brother finds them. He is slowly turning into a subsider due to lack of real blood. On an impulse the brother attacks and bites Defoe. The brother turns back to human. It seems the blood of the cured vamps like Defoe and Hawke will now turn back any existing ones. Hawke returns to his pharma company to turn himself into Neill in order to save Karan. It seems Neill has finally gotten his substitute and says it was never about a cure but about the money. When Neill calls Hawke a coward,Hawke's comeback causes Neill to lose it and he bites Hawke. Slowly but surely Neil turns back. They tie him up in  a chair and send him down an elevator to the main floor where soldiers stand waiting. Sniffing his ""human-ness"" they attack him en masse. When those soldiers turn the ones behind them attack those,and so on and so on. It seems the ball has started rolling and an all out cure is inevitable. The film ends as the three drive off into the sunset and a bat flies towards the screen.
I liked this twist on the usual vampire stories. All involved did a good job and the S/FX are well done. I was especially surprised to see one of my favourite small screen nemeses in the film;New Zealander Jay Laga'aia,who played Draco on Xena,now playing a Senator here. There's a talented guy who needs more screen time on both the big and small screen. The film does have it's extraneous moments that could have been excised from the film,such as the sub story of Neill's daughter who near the beginning of the film we learn(from Neill)has rejected becoming a vamp. It is later,unnecessarily fleshed out with her capture,turning and killing. While not a perfect film(few are) I thought overall it still was quite satisfying.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s /r of 2:40:1 and is crisp and clear. Extras include two featurettes and commentary.
All in all a nice twist to the vampire mythos in which the vamps rule the world and fight for their existence,instead of being an underclass. All involved did a bang up job and I think it's a film with a nice bite to it!",1399680000,,5534,4.657464212678937

4110294,4,B003CPPY74,"The world is now populated, largely, by vampires, a situation arising from the spread of a plague initiated by a single individual human being bitten by a vampire bat. The vampires, on the face of it, want to live cooperatively with humans but with a desperate need for blood what's a vamp to do? One solution is to make synthetic blood. This is the solution that the giant corporation, Bromley Marks has invested in with top vampire haematologist, Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke), leading the research team. However, the progress the team are making in the development of the synthetic product is not fast enough to meet the increasing demand from the vampire public. The result is that humans are rounded up for `farming' in a 'Matrix style' industrial scale extraction complex while the research continues.

Naturally enough the few remaining humans take exception to this and form a resistance group led by `Elvis' Cormac, played by the always watchable, Willem Defoe, a former vampire, who was `cured' by being, one day, accidentally exposed to the full glare of the Sun and then suddenly `quenched' by driving into a handy lake! Driving home from work one day Dalton encounters a group of humans whose car has broken down and he offers them refuge from the vampire hunters in his car. As a result he meets Cormac who relates the incident that cured him. From that moment on Dalton, already sympathetic to the humans' plight throws in his lot with them.

The film looks good on blu ray, has a few gory moments when blood starved vamps go on a feeding frenzy, conveys a key economic principle of supply and demand, and, interestingly, makes an unwitting if timely point about the bloodsucking nature of big business in the form of evil tycoon Charles Bromley, ably portrayed by Sam Neill. The disc also has, as an extra feature, a brilliant 15 minute short film called The Big Picture, which is almost worth the price of the disc alone!",1392163200,,1936,4.776119402985074

4110296,4,B003CPPY74,"This is the film that asks the questions, ""What if there really were vampires?"" Apparently a lone bat caused an outbreak and in ten years most of the world were vampires with a critical blood shortage. Vampires who do not feed on blood turn very ugly and attack fellow vampires.

Meanwhile a group of humans have a possible cure, i.e. convert vampires to humans, but what vampire wants that?

Ethan Hawke stars is our protagonist and center point for the film. He is aide by Willem Dafoe, a former vampire who drives a Trans Am  and Claudia Karvan  against the evil vampire capitalist Sam Neill.

The film has what you would expect from a vampire film, ugly bat people, people on fire, people getting bit, etc. The film is entertaining, but lacks the great characters and dialog of being a hit. It needed to take Dafoe over the top and give personality to the rest of the cast.

4110301,4,B003CPPY74,"I hate vampire movies! From Dracula to Twilight I find the whole genre absurd and have never enjoyed a film that has featured vampires, until now. I chose Daybreakers, because it is a new idea in an otherwise stale genre. It's about a modern day utopian society where the bad guys have actually won! Modern society has adapted, from industry and technology to entertainment, to accommodate a society run by vampires. Humans are nearly extinct and the vampires are looking for a blood substitute to sustain their population. On the other side, the small groups of remaining humans think they may have a cure, but need some willing vampires to help them. Even though this film features vampires, it's more of a science fiction film. about two groups trying to deal with the problems of a futuristic society, and it was really well done. Ethan Hawke stars as a vampire, who refuses to drink human blood. He feels empathy for the humans and doesn't like what his race has become. Hawke was one of these young actors who had nothing but looks. When he first started he was really nothing more than eye candy for bad movies. Since then, he's really worked at becoming a better actor and today, he thrives in Sci-Fi movies like this. He's paired with some veterans of the genre, Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill, both of whom add that aged wisdom needed to support this young cast. This film is a terrific example of how innovative and entertaining science fiction can be, but it's so much more. There are action scenes, romance, and even some gore thrown into the mix, and the result is one of the best Sci-Fi film I've seen all year. The violence and blood may turn some people off to the film, but for me, this really became a can't miss gem.",1387584000,,1732,4.572347266881029

Additionally, they become insane, violent and so forth.

The movie starts out as a drama / thriller type flick, but sadly descends into a straight action flick roughly halfway through. While this does do the job of making you sit down and take it in on the basis of plot and story (and I don't want to give too much of that away because it does make you appreciate the film, but it needs to be a bit of a surprise to see it visualized), the occasional scares that make you jump keep you there and the action does in the end seal the deal.

Still, while it follows a good arc, and has some great performances especially Ethan Hawke as the hero and Sam Neill as the bad corporation guy is quite good to watch (Willem Dafoe is always great, so that goes without saying), what this movie lacks is exploration of the world. It sets the scene and then runs with it for an action climax in about 100 minutes. And while it doesn't feel that things weren't finished off, there was so much opportunity to make this a much more well rounded world by just going into it some more. So much is hinted at, but never explored, and that's what makes this not something on the level of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000HAB4KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;and instead drags it down to entertaining, maybe even memorable, but just not all it could be. Arguably that means this is a movie that can benefit from a sequel.

It is a decent world, and it is a surprisingly nicely made movie, though at a budget of over 20mil US, one would hope so. It's clever, and surprising, but sadly degrades to your standard action fare about half way through.",1371859200,,2188,5.140449438202247

4110313,1,B003CPPY74,"Vampire films vary from the scary (Nosferatu) to the comedic (love at first bite) or to character study (interview with the Vampire) but each tries to interpret the myth of the vampire in its own unique way. ""Day breakers"" attempts to add yet another twist by showing us a future world where vampires have become the norm and blood is in short supply. Aging vampires who don't drink blood eventually become less human and more monstrous. I imagine the pitch for this film was exciting to movie producers. That's about the only thing good about the mangled mess of a film. *spoilers ahead*

Ethan Hawke is a scientist and vampire working on a vampire cure. So far he has not been successful. Sam Neil plays a top political vampire type bent on controlling the vampire population who is also desperately searching for his human daughter.

After a series of ridiculous scenes where vampires fight at a Starbucks type blood cafe and we see several vampires explode in experiments Ethan's character becomes public enemy number one. During his escape from vampire civilization he learns more about the vampire ""curse"" and how he might undo the process all the while encountering a group of human refugees. Things eventually happen all leading up to a big showdown between humans and vampires.

I will be short and say that the acting is subpar giving the talent but it can be forgiven when you think about the material the actors have to work with. Sam Neil's character is so over the top. His character just does stuff to try and provoke an audience emotion. It doesn't work. The character is totally unbelevable and his motivations and actions seem to be all over the place. At the beginning of the film he is in despair over his missing daughter, next he flippantly decides to  arrange for her death. The film gets dumber when the cure for vampirism is discovered ultimately leading to the clash between the surviving humans and the vampires.

I would normally forgive this movie as cheese had it been a Made for TV movie but the large budget, talent and time wasted on this film is unacceptable. It is an insult to all vampire films and makes the Twilight Saga look like a serious contemporary take on vampiric lore.",1370044800,,2214,4.725388601036269

4110332,4,B003CPPY74,"Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend,"" has inspired at least five (5) motion pictures to date.  In this adaptation (and expansion), the vampires are not almost-mindless, shambling bloodsuckers.  They retain all of their faculties from their human existence.  They work.  They shop.  They ""dine"" out.  Their society operates pretty-much as ours does....except for the fact that humans are treated like cattle.

Overpopulation and a reliance on one source of sustenance is killing this inversion of the natural order.  There are too many vampires and not enough humans to feed them.  And the number of viable blood ""donors"" is dwindling.  All attempts to create an artificial blood substitute have failed.  They face extinction.

In steps an underground movement of humans who have, so far anyway, managed not to be caught.  They claim to have a process which can revert vampires to their human state.  This is where the chaos of the film ensues.

""Daybreakers,"" is a fun movie.  Written and directed by the Spierig brothers (the guys who gave us ""Undead,"" in 2003) this film demonstrates that these two have calmed down.  By concentrating on the story at hand and not hodge-podging elements as they did with ""Undead,"" the Spierigs have produced a much more satisfying experience.

This was an interesting twist on the vampire genre seeing it more as a plague that humans contracted, though it's not really explained fully how the plague was created or started. I liked how this movie showed the vampires the way most if not all of us are familiar with them - staying out of the sun because they'll burn up, they have fangs and hypnotizing eyes, they have no reflection in mirrors, they can be killed with a wooden stake in the heart - you get the idea. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so just watch this movie and enjoy. But be careful, it's a bit bloody. Well, it's a vampire movie.  ;)

4110365,3,B003CPPY74,"This review contains some limited SPOILERS.

This is a honest SF/modern fantasy film about a world in which almost all people became vampires and humans were hunted almost to the extinction. Quite naturally, that creates a problem of blood supply and as vampire government and scientists cannot find a synthetic substitute, the increasingly thirsty citizens first start to riot - and later things get much, much worse...

The main hero, Dr Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke), is the leading vampire haematologist (a pretty nice joke in itself) working desperately on finding a blood substitute, under supervision of vampire billionaire and power broker Charles Bromley (Sam Neill), who controls most of the ""blood industry"" (nightmarish facilities in which blood is harvested from human chattel). But Dalton also searches for a cure against the vampirism itself, as he is deeply unhappy with his undead ""life"". He will ultimately find a promising lead when he is contacted by one of ""wild"" humans, Lionel Cormac (Willem Dafoe), who until now managed to avoid capture. The film really starts from that moment.

""Daybreakers"" is not a bad film, in fact it is a nice watch, but the story and heroes adventures are ultimately rather banal and easily predictable. Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill mostly go just through the motions as two stereotypic characters, one good, one bad. People who from the beginning are marked as just fodder die, people who we expect to live survive and those who ALWAYS betray, well, they betray... The one exception here is the pretty well thought character of Edward Dalton and Ethan Hawke's performance playing him.

But the main attraction in this film is the general vision of vampire's world, which is pretty well done and by moments very amusing. The vampires in this film are quite close to the ""classical"" vision of those undead monsters - they die if exposed to the sun, they do not reflect in mirrors and they can be killed only by a wooden stake to their dead hearts. As the result we can see at one moment in a mirror an expensive suit which seemingly walks by itself, as the person wearing it has no reflection...)))

The society in fact do not seem to have changed a lot. We have hobos begging on the streets for blood, street ""fast-foods"" offering blood-coffee, suburbia residences with a neighbourhood electronic watch warning about upcoming sunrise, vampire detectives making inappropriate comments on crime scenes, undead rebellious teenagers, class divisions and the rat race in work place are still the same, etc. There are also some pretty good one liners, as the one used as the title of this review.

So, even if the story is extremely predictable and most of characters are just stereotypes, this film still is a nice and rather amusing watch, recommended for SF or vampire films amateurs. Still, it is a thing to watch once and I do not intend to keep the DVD - so renting it rather than purchasing can be a good idea.",1354579200,,2957,4.8804780876494025

But the blood supply is threatened because of human population decline. Ethan Hawke is a vampire scientist researching a ""cure"" for this blood supply shortage--artificial blood. But an inexpensive, easily accessible supply of blood threatens corporate interests. Sound familiar?

4110370,5,B003CPPY74,"A vampire outbreak has overtaken the world.
Only this time they are not mindless and brutal savages, but immortals with the same society we have today - only they need to drink blood to survive.
Enter blood farming. Humans are rounded up and used to feed the population. The problem is that there isn't enough blood to go around. A faux blood replacement is in development but so far unsuccessful.

Our protagonist has human sympathies, having been unwillingly converted. He's searching for the cure, but jepordises his position when he shields a group of runaway humans from those tasked with hunting them down to become farm captives.

As supplies of blood diminish the civilised element of the vampire society decays, and anarchy begins with these vampires becoming mindless brutes in a matter of weeks without human blood.

Can the humans be saved? Can a replacement blood supply be found? Or is humanity doomed to die out in bloodlust?",1339718400,,940,4.936708860759493

4110372,5,B003CPPY74,"Imagine if vampires took over the world. 'Daybreakers' takes that idea and goes, ""Okay, what next?"" How would society change? How would its inhabitants survive? How long would such a world even last? The result is a horror film that works on multiple levels; it's entertaining, filled with blood and carnage but is also fairly intelligent and works on an allegorical level as well.

In the not-too-distant future, a plague turns 95% of the humans into vampires. The remaining humans are captured and subsequently farmed for blood by a pharmaceutical company . Years pass, and the blood supply is slowly dwindling. If deprived of blood, vampires devolve into 'subsiders'; feral bat-like creatures. Hematologist Edward (no relation to Cullen) attempts to find a blood substitute when he in turn encounters a group of human survivors, lead by a former vampire who has claimed to find a cure for humanity.

The amount of detail put into the vampires' world is stunning; it's apparent that a lot of care was put into explaining just how such a society would thrive. There are a few holes though; namely, if the blood supply is dwindling, why not force the humans to reproduce? A throwaway line that the humans had become infertile due to the plague or something similar would have helped.

All of the actors give great performances. Ethan Hawke's character is stoic for most of the film but he still delivers a strong portrayal as Edward. Willem Dafoe clearly had a lot of fun playing 'Elvis' and often steals the show. Sam Neill in my mind gives the best performance as Charles Bromley, the head of the sinister corporation farming humans. He's able to create a slimy character that is also quite tragic and complex.

As for the Blu-ray, the film is visually stunning and really benefits from high definition. Features-wise, the Blu-ray edition is stacked. The highlight is an extensive two-hour documentary about the production of the film. No stone is left unturned as it covers everything from early conception all the way to release. I'd have to say that it's something I'll probably only watch once but film buffs will appreciate the look into how the film was made. We also get a commentary track from the directors and an early short film that they made.

Overall, 'Daybreakers' is one of the better vampire films to come out recently and is worth your time.",1338422400,,2361,4.86318407960199

The surviving humans are either harvested for their blood in creepy scientific vats or they're on the run from vampire police. It had an interesting concept and the reviews from the big names said the script was engaging. All said, I felt it was a hit or miss picture that seemed to be focused on one chase after another while trying to put some character into the characters. I suspect the biggest problem was that they tried to put too much action and gore into a film that probably should have been an hour longer if they wanted richer characters and other factors like exploring some of the concepts more (such as a nation outpacing its resources). Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe and Sam Neil star in various roles. The budget was $20M and it made a bit over $54M at the Box Office.

4110388,3,B003CPPY74,"There's a very simple reason for Daybreakers' modest success, and that's due to the state of the vampire/horror sub-genre.  There may be fleeting instances of a compelling vision, but the fact of the matter is that The Spierig brothers have concocted something that would have struggled a decade ago.  For what it is now worth, this movie is a breathe of fresh air for everyone who isn't on a team.

And If you get that reference, then you've already fallen victim to the real curse.

The movie itself endures the trials of its nasty faults through the strength of a solid concept and a potent atmosphere.  Even with its meek budget, the vampiric dystopia is an intriguing sight.

Unfortunately, the imagination fails to follow us into the middle ground of the film, which lulls into mediocrity as some loose ends and plot points are clumsily tied together.  It's not difficult to see where the Spierigs' priorities lie, and you won't be surprised to know that the cliffhanger ending draws right into a future sequel.

But even the foundation that they've set for themselves is laden with cracks and faulty handiwork that will likely plague whatever franchise or ""trilogy"" they may hope to build upon.  It's just a little too one-dimensional to be taken seriously, aside from respectable cinematography and an eye for the unconventional.

Still, where there's potential, there's greatness, and it doesn't hurt to see a solid lineup of actors filling in the roles.  It's an ensemble as unusual and interesting as the core concept, and their interactions really stand as the high points within the film itself.  Old vets who haven't been seen for what seems like ages - Hawke and Neill - aren't nearly as rusty as one would suspect, and Dafoe is predictably charming.

So long as their characters are set in stone for future travels, I'm on for the ride, but I have little doubt that it'll be quite a bumpy one.",1324166400,,1909,4.801223241590214

When the population of vampires - who infect their victims who then return as additional vampires - reach a tipping point, the population of ""herd"" humans becomes dangerously low and endangers the continued existence of the now-majority vampire population.  The story line appears to be attempting to make a comparison with rampant consumerism, energy shortage, and peak oil, and it works rather well, if perhaps a bit heavy-handed in spots. There is, of course, the traditional ""ebil korporate ceo"" played well with his usual ""cool evil"" by Sam Neill (a vampire, of course) who goes so far as to have a minion ""turn"" his own daughter who has resisted becoming a vampire.",1318377600,,766,4.937984496124031

4110396,2,B003CPPY74,"Sometimes a movie that comes with high expectations, when not fulfilled, consequently gets a lower rating than [perhaps] it should. That is the situation with ""Daybreakers"".

What a cool premise! Vampires have taken over the world and are the majority. Forget about ""Trueblood"" mainstreaming, in this movie, vampires run the world, pretty much like the humans that they have replaced. They are no longer monsters of the dark but, rather, they seem normal. They just can't be exposed to the sun and now they no longer get their blood out of human necks but rather through processed means, just like how modern meat is distributed.

The conflict is that with the dwindling of humans, there's a dwindling of food supply which threatens the vampires' world. Some humans are simply farmed for their blood while there is  mad dash to find an artificial substitute for the life sustaining serum. With the shortage of blood, there is chaos on the streets.

Ethan Hawke is a blood scientist that works for a large greedy corporation, run by actor Sam Neill, that is looking to not only capitalize on getting a blood substitute but also make the real thing a commodity only for the rich. Hawke has never embraced his vampirism (much like Brad Pitt's character in ""Interview with the Vampire""). Neill loves his immortality and is sad that he has a daughter that is still a ""human"".

The movie lays out a vampire society where undergound tunnels, special uniforms and cars, and other nice twists on traditional vampire lore that enable safe travels during the day. Up to this point, this film creates a fascinating innovation to the vampire film.

However, once the plot is established, there is a freefall in quality. One evening Hawke gets into a car accident with humans ""rebels"", elects to help them with their cause, pursues a cure for vampirism and now the movie gets horribly cheesy.

Famed actors Ethan Hawke and Sam Neill (as the CEO of the greedy corporation) act like they are just collecting paychecks. The action scenes between the vampires and humans resemble 70's era ""Battlestar Galactica"". While the direction leaves an interesting sheen to the film, the editing and storyline is terrible. Once the conflict is established for the movie, it never really knows where it is going. Many of the action scenes do not make sense as to why it erupted and what the eventual outcome was. The us of vampire police officers/swat team members/soldiers resemble the faceless ""Evil Empire"" soldiers from Star Wars. They look silly and campy.

It is not that the movie is that bad since it s mildly entertaining. It's just that the premise was such a cool and innovative slant on a well worn genre that once the premise was established, it was all down hill with the cornball plot.

I loved this movie.  I thought it was a very unique take on the vampire genre film.  The special effects, cinematography, costuming, actors - all great.  I especially enjoyed Ethan Hawke as Edward Dalton, vampire hematologist, and Willem Dafoe, vintage car enthusiast and human who is working with Dalton to find a cure for the vampire plague.

The movie, taking place in our future, has a 1940's noir feel to it from the costuming and lighting.  I liked all the little tidbits scattered throughout the movie showing details of daily living in this world where humans are no longer the dominant species.

Just a note - most of these vampires are NOT warm and cuddly Twilight vampires and some of them are truly horrendous.  It definitely deserves its R rating.",1306540800,4,1049,4.526595744680851

I wasn't really taken with any of the characters.  None of them were real well played.  For all the emotion that could have been used in this movie, there just wasn't that excitable feeling to it.  Ethan Hawke was rather lackluster and while he played an important character, he just didn't seem important.

For the plot it was a basic virus breaks out we have to cure the world.  Nothing new there.  But I did like the little nuances of the movie.  The way they made a culture for the vampires and provided all the detail surrounding it (papers, ads, signs, restaurants, etc.) was impressively done.  I don't remember much about the music, so obviously it wasn't memorable.  And to be honest, writing this review a few days later, I had to think for a couple minutes to remember that I did watch this particular movie.  So it was easily forgettable.

Not a terrible movie but definitely one that I won't be watching again any time soon.

But PS: Ethan need to pick way more decent rolls I like most of them that goes straight to DVD movies but the big screen movie hasn't been too good.",1303430400,,356,4.235294117647059
4110400,4,B003CPPY74,"Daybreakers was written and directed by Michael and Peter Spierig. Even though it is a movie about vampires (you know those creatures that drink blood, don't deal with teen angst for 200 years, don't sparkle, and walk around in the daylight) it felt like a mixture of horror, science fiction, and a drama all at once. The concept is original in the realm of bloodsuckers as in this alternate future vampirism has become mainstream and they are the dominating force on the planet with humans nearing extinction number wise.

We are shown that vampires who cannot feed don't die immediately but turn into half human half bad creatures brought up from the original nightmarish vampires that have populated books and movies for years.
Unlike many vampires they turn into a creature devoid of most of their memories who just wants to feed on anything they can which contains blood.

Daybreakers takes an interesting approach on the idea of a food shortage that would arise from overpopulation as there is a 'blood shortage' from an overpopulation of vampires. The leading providers of blood to the populace are desperately attempting to create a synthetic blood that will be nourishing enough to keep the vampires alive and that is where we enter the film. Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) plays the lead researcher trying to create this blood and is running into a dead end.

On his way home one night he gets into an accident with a group of humans who are on the run and helps them avoid the police as he doesn't wish for the end of humanity that he dearly misses. The humans are part of a resistance group that is led by Elvis (Willem Dafoe) who accidentally found a cure for the disease. They enlist Edward on a quest to cure this 'disease' that has spread across the world.

The owner of the blood providing company and now one of the most powerful men, or vampires, in the world is Charles Bromley (Sam Neill) who doesn't want this cure to exist as he was dying from cancer before the turn. He is willing to stop at nothing for both the cure to be destroyed and a synthetic blood to be created including working directly against Edward's friends and family. While Sam did an astounding job at playing a genius vampire mad with power and the desire to live forever I felt it would have served him better near the end of the film to have a little more of the craziness that he was able to display in ""Event Horizon.""

The world created here is a very dark and noir take on humanity. With everyone only able to exist at night and there not being a way to die the world is slightly different. Blood coffee shops are found on every corner, smoking is prevalent, and with the lack of being able to be in the sun the majority of the film is done in a very dark setting that you can't help but enjoy. You are shown, subtly, the various layers of the vampire
society as the film progresses. You are given a huge glimpse into a world that has completely changed from our society but is clearly built upon it and I hope it was able to make enough to warrant a sequel as the world they have created is nothing short of spectacular in it's original viewpoint on an age old monster.",1301875200,4,3165,4.487847222222222
4110401,3,B003CPPY74,"With the spate of vampire films dominating the horror genre these days, it was inevitable someone decided to make a movie about a world in which the vampires won. And so we have Daybreakers, an oddly bloodless film that turns the usual vampire tropes on their ear.

Instead of humans hunting vampires, vampires are hunting humans. In 2019, vampires are the majority and in just under a decade it has transformed to accommodate them.  Covered vehicles and tunnels allow vampires to travel during the day, humans are farmed for their blood (shades of the Matrix) and blood is mixed into every beverage.

If near future seems a little too near, it's because Daybreakers runs the fine line between maintain vampire traditions and jumping ahead to its sci-fi premise: the bloodsuckers of the world are running out of humans to eat. Vampires who do not feed on human blood begin to transform into something out of Nosferatu - all fangs, pointed ears, and bat wings.  They become subhuman, nicknamed ""subsiders"" because they live in the tunnels.

Ethan Hawke is Edward Dalton, a vampire hematologist who was forcibly turned by his brother Frankie (Michael Dorman).  He works feverishly to find a blood substitute, a personal conflict that comes to a head when he stumbles across a group of human survivors.

The plot stumbles from there.  There are two competing interests at the core of Daybreakers - feeding the addiction with an alternate source (artificial blood) vs. not being addicted in the first place (not being a vampire).  You can substitute blood for oil, electricity, corn, or any other staple that modern societies gorge themselves on, but the premise is the same...civilized society is forced to either evolve to a more accommodating lifestyle or devolve into barbarism as resources dwindle.  Heady stuff, right?

The problem is that Daybreakers tries to crunch world-shaking events into human scale: brother (Edward) vs. brother (Frankie), father (Sam Neil as Charles Bromley, CEO of a pharmaceutical company looking for a synthetic substitute) vs. daughter (Isabel Lucas as Alison, who refuses to turn into a vampire), humans (Claudia Karvan as Audrey, a human survivor) vs. vampires (Willem Dafoe as a vampire convert to humanity).  It's a lot take in, and character development suffers.  Audrey's plight is marginalized and DaFoe's quirky talents are wasted on a character named Elvis. The film drags until the second half, when the race is on between the two ethos and each characters' ethics is put to the test.

Okay, not really.  In the end, everyone acts precisely true to form.  For all of its high ambition, Daybreakers is surprisingly rote. If you take away the setting there's not much to sink your teeth into. But for vampire fans, the setting is half the fun.",1301788800,,2782,5.015217391304348
4110402,4,B003CPPY74,"The plot of this movie is simple.  It is the near future and a plague has taken over the world; a plague that turns humans into vampires.  The few uninfected humans are chased as food.  The movie focuses on a vampire scientist who encounters a man who used to be a vampire, and who chanced upon a cure that turns vampires back into humans.  The race is then on to spread this cure to the rest of the world.  The movie features a cast of well-known actors; actors known for serious roles, and they don't disappoint in this movie.  Being rated R, there a occasional scenes of violence, gore, and bad language, but no more than say the Underworld movies.  The dialog is very good, and the special effects are just enough to keep things believable.  Overall, probably the best vampire movie of the past decade or so.",1299628800,3,812,4.4391891891891895

4110404,5,B003CPPY74,"frightfully original with a somber message, you will either love this movie or completely miss the point...  this is a meaningful thought-provoking piece, finally a vampire movie with a focus not on the decadence of vampires, but the deterioration of its entire parasitic culture as a whole; the story hides under the cloak of a genre film to expose the problems our modern society is currently facing in disturbing and portentous ways; we as human consumers are draining our planet and its resources dry, just like the vampires in this story; and what happens to them will surely happen to us as we continue on our current path of destruction (in fact, it has already started).  the characters all seem so real it's chilling to watch as the fate of their (or is it our?) world unfold.  goes to prove that not all horror movies need to rely on gore and guts to influence the audience, and that even a genre film can be made relevant and realistic in refreshingly creative ways. this may just be the best vampire movie i have ever seen, better than all the ""cult"" and art-house vampire flicks combined, not especially because of its characters, actions, or special effects, but for its central conservationist message, a resounding wake-up call that is loud and clear, for anyone who cares to tune in.  how unfortunate it is that the masses can never choose a gem like this over all the rubbish, it's just a shame that Daybreakers came out just when True Blood and Twilight did, the timing could not have been worse... so if you're reading this, spread the word and get the name of this movie out there, because it deserves more recognition.",1298937600,,1640,4.684027777777778
4110405,4,B003CPPY74,"First, I really think Ethan Hawke does not get the credit he deserves as an actor.  He is a real talent, and holds your attention on screen.  In DAYBREAKERS, he grabs your attention.  The movie is a vampire movie with a twist...our protagonist is sympathetic to the Human blight. In that alone, the tension of this movie builds and the story line evolves.  Sam Neill is wonderful as the vampire villainous businessman, and William Dafoe is outstanding as the ex-vampire ""comic"" relief character.  But it is Hawke who makes the movie work so well.  His mood affects the over all tone, and the tone reflects his over all mood.  I will not dwell on what others have stated, just that this is a far and fresh departure from TWILIGHT...and sparkly vampires.",1297036800,2,752,4.694656488549619

This has to be one of my favorite movies, only beat out by The Matrix and A Nightmare on Elm Street (I recommend all six of those and all 3 matrix movies aswell).",1296691200,,456,4.193181818181818

4110408,3,B003CPPY74,"""Daybreakers"" DVD is an escape for your brain, if you live in the ""big city"". I definitely did not get burned, having bought this DVD, because I approached the purchase with extreme caution when I saw Willem Dafoe's name on the cover. Willem Dafoe has no problems accepting a role in a bad film. Daybreakers was not a ""bad"" film. It is what I call, a ""formula"" scary film, which met minimal requirements. In this case, watching the film all the way through to the end, and not feeling like you wasted your time, is a good minimal requirement.

Video --- Very good video. Scary movies are usually, mostly dark, plus Daybreakers is about vampires, so you know there couldn't be much sunlight in the film. Dark movies are a challenge for anyone's home theater video equipment. I used the same video settings, I used for ""The Book of Eli"", and the darkness in the film still looked good. (I use a projector and ten foot diameter screen, so I'm always tweaking something!)

Audio --- Superb. The film has 5.1 ""EX"" on the cover, so that is a little extra something, which is appreciated. More bang for your buck. Can't complain. Anyway, lots of explosions and there is a rain scene in one of the earlier chapters, which will ""work out"" your surround system. You will think it's raining inside your room.",1296086400,2,1297,4.586206896551724
4110409,4,B003CPPY74,"1.  I'll keep it short and sweet:  this film isn't going to change the world and create world peace etc... but it will provide some solid entertainment.  It's based on a solid script, well acted and has some good action... and it's based on the whole vampire thing.  What more can you ask for?",1296000000,,293,4.37037037037037
4110410,3,B003CPPY74,"""Daybreakers"" has a rather clever concept -- if vampires existed, wouldn't they eventually end up outnumbering humans?

The movie doesn't quite carry off that concept, introducing semi-scientific vampirism and then muddling the whole idea of how it works and is cured. But despite its drawbacks, it's still an entertainingly sleek, action-packed story with a surfeit of disgusting gore and a few genuinely wrenching moments.

By the year 2019, the earth is almost entirely populated by vampires, except for a small minority of humans who are drained of their blood. But now almost all humans are gone -- and if vampires don't regularly drink at least a little human blood, they morph into mindless batlike ""subsiders."" Because of this, hematologist Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) is desperately trying to formulate a blood substitute.

Then he encounters a small group of humans led by Audrey (Claudia Karvan). Sensing that he's sympathetic to their cause, Audrey reveals something shocking -- Elvis (Willem Dafoe), a man who was cured of his vampirism. Now Edward must unravel the secret of curing vampirism before all humans and vampires are destroyed.

""Daybreakers"" clearly wants to be a thinking-person's vampire movie -- it presents a ""what if?"" world that would probably come to pass if there were vampires, and it presents vampirism as a plague.

Unfortunately, it never really gives any answers -- the cure for vampirism are especially confusing, and the final twist about how to cure people is bafflingly inexplicable. It's never foreshadowed or hinted at -- it just pops out of nowhere. Plus we're saddled with the usual ""big corporations = pure evil"" cliche. Blech.

But if you turn off some of your brain cells, ""Daybreakers"" is a pretty entertaining twist on the vampire genre. Directors Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig paint the vampire world in cold, bleak lighting that seems to sap all color, while the humans' scenes are ramshackle, dusty and brightly lit. There are lots of fast chase scenes (including a ridiculous one on a bridge), tolerable writing, and a literal bloodbath where we see vampires tearing humans apart.

Hawke does a pretty tolerable job as Edward, an angsty vampire who is trying to save as many people as possible -- the character isn't very unique, but Hawke plays it with melancholy power. Karvan is a generic love interest with nothing much to do except get captured, but Willem DeFoe is pretty brilliant as a drawling mechanic human-turned-vampire-turned-human.

""Daybreakers"" aspires to be more than it ends up being, but it's still a fairly entertaining vampire movie -- certainly better than the ""Twilight"" series.",1295136000,,2660,5.169767441860465
4110411,4,B003CPPY74,"It is 2019 and the planet is ten years into the infection of a virus that has turned humans into vampires. There are only a small number of humans remaining, and the vampires hunt them in order to harvest their blood. A vampire blood scientist who disagrees with the consumption of human blood is trying to find a blood substitute. He encounters a group of people who are hiding out and he teams with them in order to attempt to find a way for the humans to be able to no longer live in fear. This is a very effective science fiction mystery, with engaging players, not simply stock characters to be sacrificed for entertainment. The film is gory at times, but not overly so. This is solid entertainment for moviegoers who are not too sensitive to the sight of blood onscreen.",1294185600,,776,4.471830985915493

Heavy handed scenes are infused with corpses exploding, the 'cure' for vampirism will make even the most forgiving stop in their paces and go, wait, WHAT? The melee in the climax is ridiculously violent and contains a few severed parts. But despite all of this, I was utterly charmed by this movie because it doesn't know how ridiculous it is.

After a few years filled with garbage like Twilight and the Vampire Diaries which presents vampires as overly sexualized emo bloodsuckers, Daybreakers does something new. It creates a believible, functioning society of vampires and follows its own set of rules. It's a feat I haven't seen since I first read Richard Matheson's I Am Legend and it's quite lovely in between all the fire and the blood. Not that I mind the fire or the blood at all.",1293494400,,817,4.794326241134752

And, although it isn't a comedy, it definitely had a few moments that had my friends and I laughing hysterically. I guess that isn't really a good thing, but it adds to the enjoyment nonetheless.

In my opinion, what it really comes down to with this movie is; if you are a big fan of vampire movies you should probably rent it and have a few friends over who won't take it too seriously. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, I'd say skip it. You won't be missing too much. I don't really recommend buying it unless you find it dirt cheap.

They're either too stupid, gory, nonsensical, or some combination of the above, for my tastes...and yet, though I dislike most of its movies, I like the genre. Which is why I liked Daybreakers -- it broke that mold, and did a good job at it. It was very creative, with a new and interesting storyline, did a great job setting the atmosphere, and generally was an enjoyable film. For these reasons, the film deserves 5 stars. However, there were instances when the CGI was less than spectacular (particularly noticeable on blu-ray). There was also excessive gore at points, but it's lack of realism made it less offensive than it might otherwise have been (ie bodies exploding in video-game-esque splats, etc.). To me, though, the positive aspects of this film mostly made up for the negative ones, so I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars...a very good, but not perfect, movie.

An outline of the story follows; I've trimmed out most of the subplots and a lot of character development to keep it reasonably short, but I think it still conveys the main points of the movie.. Only read if you don't mind (key) spoilers.

**LOTS OF SPOILERS**

The story is set in 2019, after a bat-born plague has converted the majority of humanity into vampires. The remaining humans, after being offered a chance to assimilate into vampire-kind, are now hunted and farmed for their blood. In the meantime, Edward Dalton (whose company is one of the key companies responsible for farming humans) is working to produce a blood substitute. Dalton is an unwilling-vampire, who was changed, against his will, by his younger brother (in an effort to ""save him""). At this point, human-kind is almost extinct...which likewise means extinction for vampires, for, once their source of food is gone, they will go as well. Vampires who are deprived of blood for extended periods devolve into a subtype of vampires -- a basically feral creature, whose brain has broken down extensively and who loses all powers of ratiocination or other ""humanizing"" features...it becomes a dangerous, blood-drinking machine. (This process is only hastened when vampires feed on vampires).
Too little blood, and too much work, sets Edward Dalton up for an accident one night. This in turn introduces Dalton to a clandestine network of humans -- humans running from the vampires, and humans setting up a network of important human-sympathizing vampires. Dalton is such a vampire -- but, more importantly, he's a vampire with a heavy scientific background.
The sort of head of the human resistance is a former vampire, who unwittingly discovered the process by which to cure vampirism and was himself cured of it. He needs a scientist to recreate the process. Dalton is that scientist.
Betrayed by a friend and fellow scientist, and with the clock ticking as vampires discover their hide-out, Dalton finishes the experiment, and returns to being a human. He and two others escape the vampires, but the rest of the human resistance is discovered and destroyed -- the blood shortages have made even the loyal soldiers so desperate for blood that, rather than bringing the humans in, they kill the humans for their own feeding.
Dalton's brother finds them, and, while willing to help his brother, decides to feed on his friend (the one who was, previously, a vampire as well). This leads to the discovery that -- just as tainted blood will hasten vampire's decline into the feral state -- cured blood provides the antidote to vampirism.
Using this knowledge, Dalton tricks his former boss -- and one of the chief culprits of humankind's suffering -- into feeding on him. The vampire who was once at the top of the chain of vampires, eagerly overseeing the hunting and farming of humans, now finds himself at the mercy of vampires as merciless as he...after he meets his demise at the hands of his own starving soldiers, they in turn find themselves meeting their demise at the hands of their comrades -- setting off a chain reaction, whereby -- as each vampire feeds on former vampires -- humanity will eventually be restored.

** End of spoilers **

As I said above, I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't perfect, but it was very good. It had a dark, almost depressing air to the first half or so of the film that conveyed what was wrong with the world of vampires. As things changed, however, so too did the tone (so the film didn't end on a depressing note). The characters were all good to very good. And the storyline was original and interesting. If you want a good vampire movie, I recommend this one. 4.5/5 stars",1290902400,,4617,4.82449494949495
4110419,4,B003CPPY74,"In the year 2019 the human race is an endangered species. Because of the global pandemic most people have become vampires, and the remaining humans are either forced to hide from the vampires (who are now in control of the entire social systems), or ""kept"" as food. But vampires have their own problems as they are also facing the threat of extinction.

""Daybreakers"" may remind you of one Richard Matheson story. A vampire hematologist Edward Dalton (Ethan Hake) has been working for the pharmaceutical company run by Charles Bromley (Sam Neill), doing the research to create a blood substitute. Edward becomes accidentally involved with a group of human survivors led by Audrey (Claudia Karvan), who asks him for help to save them.

The film offers an intriguing interpretation of the conventions of vampire film as well as the interesting details of the vampire-dominated society. It is part allegorical, but the allegory is not too serious. The cinematography is memorable with the effective use of dark blue lights.

Anyone who has seen the quirky Australian zombie film ""Undead"" may remember the name of the brother/director team Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig. ""Daybreakers"" is by far superior to their 2003 low-budget film, with a more focused theme and a tighter pace, but its action set-pieces (including a car chase) needs better stunts and choreography, and though the film's conclusion is not totally predictable, it is still a sort of disappointment, as it is not as innovative as the original idea with which ""Daybreakers"" has started.

""Daybreakers"" is an entertaining horror/suspense with very interesting premises. The film is flawed, but still engaging with a few new, original ideas.",1290816000,,1706,5.192727272727272
4110420,4,B003CPPY74,"If you buy into the premise that vampires are not only around, but have pretty much taken over the world, Daybreakers is an enjoyable film.  Stylish and well-crafted, it stars Ethan Hawke and Willem Defoe as troubled vampires with a difference.

This vampire-dominated world has a problem.  As the human population they feed from disappears from old age, abuse, or, most frequently, 'conversion' into vampires, a blood shortage develops.  And since vampires are immortal (and often immoral, the film points out) this is a problem.  A company headed by a very creepy Sam Neil is working on a blood substitute, so the strange world of vampires can continue.  BTW, a cure for cancer isn't needed in this world; just be 'converted' and you're immortal, and presumably the cancer goes into permanent remission.

Willem Defoe stumbles on a wrinkle in the search for the solution of the blood shortage.  Hawke, who is already feeling guilty about using innocent humans as farm animals, quickly signs up.  But that doesn't set well with some highly placed vampires who run the corporate and governments of the planet.

Recommended.  This film has style and cinematography to burn.  The acting is good, the set design is very good, and the premise is unique and sort of follows the unspoken idea behind all of those other vampire stories; what happens after they start biting others and making them into immortal souls?  Do they still need to work?  How do they get their blood feast if they are holding down a 9-5 job?  An interesting take on the usual vampire flick.

This is an enjoyable movie that bends some of the rules vampires are supposed to play by, but it mostly works.

The story takes place during a critical time for the world's vampires (almost all of the population) because of shortages in natural human blood. Vampire soldiers are tasked to round up the few remaining free humans and vampire blood specialists working on synthetic blood substitute attempt to hold off pending disaster, with mixed results.

The acting and special effects are fairly good, and there is enough action and gore to keep most fans of the genre engaged.
I enjoyed watching this enough that I saw twice in as many days.

4110426,4,B003CPPY74,"DAYBREAKERS is something new in the vampire genre. Taking its cue from the Vampire side of the situation, it winds its way to the obvious conclusion. I will not bother you with the details. I bought this unseen....I am not disappointed. This movie skips into a less human world and into the vampiric with a decent storyline and a handful of quasi-believeable characters.

The aspect that I find disappointing is that it compacts into a movie that which could be much better explored in a TV mini-series, or even series. One doesn't get to jump inside the skin of the vampire, feel his/her pain, wander through nosferatic, nocturnal streets or walkways and get the ""feel"" of what has the potential to be a fascinating world. An hour and a half etc. just isn't enough. Daybreakers took me to a place I would like to visit again, but not necessarily a sequel.....I am DEFINITELY thinking mini-series.

This movie is for those who have a taste for Vamps, BUT are not looking for swords, sex, or testosterne-driven action! Daybreakers requires a bit more of you than that. If, like me, you have a collection of the vampiric, then pick this one up and absorb it. If you are a vampire novice, or looking to introduce someone to the genre, then I would suggest the BLADE series, or the Underwiorld series to start. For those who like to incorporate overt sexuality...go for True Blood. For the barely out of their teens, have no idea what love or life are really about, I would suggest the vapid Twilight series.

Again...well worth the money for us vampofiles....but I have a longing to get drenched in the atmosphere of it....drenched in what?...you may well ask ; )",1287619200,,1660,4.697594501718213

4110429,4,B003CPPY74,"A novel idea drives this atmospheric vampire flick.. a vampire outbreak has not just started, but has reached its ultimate stage - now human civilisation IS vampire, with office hours now at night time, and the companies farming human blood now the equivalent to multinational energy conglomerates.  But only a handful of humans remain, and blood is now getting scarcer and scarcer.  This concept is well portrayed with nice touches showing how civilisation has adapted to servicing a night time society - the shielded cars, the tunnels for day time use, signs showing school loading times at 2am to 3am only.  The allegory for our non renewable energy supply running out is apt too, with CNN showing the `blood crisis' gradually eroding society as starvation drives the masses to violence and the governments to crack down.  The plot is somewhat less interesting, but works well enough, with Ethan Hawke the employee with a conscience, looking for a blood alternative, or even better a cure.  His boss, Sam Neill doesn't want a cure - he wants `repeat business'.  Then Hawke meets Willem Dafoe, who may just have the answer.
The effects are fine, the idea interesting, and the actors are more than up to the task of making the outrageous ideas believable.  If the plot takes a few unnecessary detours (Sam Neill's daughter appears to serve no useful purpose to driving the story forward) and doesn't ultimately offer a very polished ending, it's still very much a journey worth taking, and an admirable attempt to do something new with the genre.

4110436,5,B003CPPY74,"DAYBREAKERS

You know vampires have become a huge thing again which I guess makes me happy since I love them. The thing is, for the most part it is not the vampires I like, today's vampires seem to be all in love and twinkle in the sunlight. What ever happened to the guys that were evil and would um let's say burn in the sunlight. Well let me stop being so one dimensional since I tend to think I am all for something new. With that said there is finally something new in the vampire world that I like, this wonderful film and even better DVD.

It was not that long ago we were watching this in the theaters and absolutely loved it and just like I hoped the DVD release was great. But we will get to that later, let's talk about the film. The film is set in the not to distant future, ten years or something like that, and the entire population is made up of vampires. Yes you read that right and there are only about 5% of humans left to feed on. The crazy thing is that all of them were at one point human and were turned because of a virus, a pandemic. With such a low percentile left the food supply for the vampires is dwindling , so an alternative is being worked on by the top researchers the population has. One of those vampires is Edward Dalton [Ethan Hawke] who is sympathetic towards the humans, in fact he wants to be one. He has his military little brother to thank for changing him, I guess they don't get along much.

There is also another problem out there, if they don't get enough blood in them they start to mutate into creatures called subsiders. These vampires resemble bats and are very vicious, even attacking and killing ""normal"" vampires in order to survive. Naturally that puts pressure on the company he works for Bromley Marks and its owner Charles Bromley (Sam Neill), who puts pressure on him. But it is after a chance encounter with a group of humans that Edward realizes he must do more for them. Well actually it is when they show up at his place asking him for help. It is after this he meets a human named Elvis [Willem Dafoe], who once was a vampire himself. Turns out after some exposure to sunlight while being thrown from his car into water he was cured of the disease.

So they team together to find a way to duplicate the effects in a controlled environment, were Edward eventually cures himself. During all of this the vampire's military is still hunting down humans for the harvest. The company still makes most of its money by the blood harvesting they do. But when Edward returns to let his boss in on the cure it turns out Bromley is not interested. He likes things the way they are and wants vampires to continue to rule over the world. What is a former vampire to do in such a situation?

Written and directed by Michael and Peter Spierig who previously made the independent film ""Undead"" did a masterful job with this film. The idea to the story all the way to the actual script was great in my opinion. Plus the look of the film is great with a lot of interesting characters to fill in this world. Depending on your taste you probably either loved or hated their first film ""Undead"" but either way I am sure you could see the potential these two had. I think they are realizing that potential very quickly with such a great film like this, can't wait to see what they next.

With such great characters you have to have actors to bring them to life, and we have that here. Ethan Hawke who when I first had seen the trailers for this seemed out of place for this type of film really surprised me. He did an excellent and was really the right choice to play our lead in this film, in fact the more I think about it he didn't seem out of place I was just in a bad place at that time. He is the right type of person to play the sympathetic character in this, so well done. On the flip side Sam Neill was perfect as the business man that is all about just that, business. He is one of those types who likes his business because business is good, you know that type. And of course you know the great Willem Dafoe is perfect in this and I really love his back story here a lot. Over all the entire cast did an excellent job on this, really they did.

Now if there is any flaw to this film it is that the subsiders are not explored enough, there is so much more there. I found these creatures to be highly interesting and felt they need to be explored more, but perhaps a sequel is what we need. Maybe as the world is being brought back to normal these subsiders need to be rounded up and exterminated. Also add in that all those who want to remain vampires will eventually turn so they are also still a threat. Still the fact that this is the world we live in were the economy and jobs and everything is still an ongoing thing it makes it more realistic, and that helps take away from the flaw.

Still it is the EXCELLENT special features that this release has that makes it a step above others coming out. There are all kinds of features to watch, trailers and even a great commentary by the Brother filmmakers. But it is the highly interesting, entertaining, and very in depth informative making of that is great. Honestly it is one of the best making of features I have ever seen, and it is not your average10 to 15 minute behind the scenes look. It goes all the way back to when the brothers scraped money together to make ""Undead"" and how that lead into this. From writing it to pitching it to scouting and casting, it has a very in depth look at pre production, VERY in depth look at the production , and of course in depth post production. It even goes all the way to the premiere of the film. Were you might give this a four star rating on the film if that was all you have seen, then know that a five star rating is the least you can give the DVD/Blu-Ray if reviewed.

Also I have heard people talk about the ending, myself if asked would say it was perfect. plus who could hate one of the goriest endings ever.",1280361600,2,5965,4.239226033421284
4110437,2,B003CPPY74,"I got this film's number. Read on if you're ready for some spoilers.

In this nifty genre-bending script (It's an action/horror/sci-fi plot with Earth Day subtext), the Spierig Bros' post-human world applies common vampire lore to a mass population. Interesting. Ethan Hawke plays a scientist in search of a cure, while the vampires in power merely want to uphold the status quo. Then, the humans show up (watch for a blatant disregard for the world's rules), and a delicate trust is formed. Great cinematography and excellent monster makeup from Weta sweetens the deal.
The overwhelming odds stack up quickly, and keep you watching through the middle 50 minutes, when the convoluted discovery of double-cures in Act III trips you up (""heeey - this is all MADE UP"") and from there, the filmmakers wrap up the plot hastily in a skyscraper's lobby - just enough for a closed story, but not enough for a sequel. A new genre is introduced: zombie gorefest, and a new, underdeveloped villain gets a slow-mo death scene. The promises they seem to make (world-curing epidemic, fantastic flaming vampire cures) never really pan out, and the movie is the lesser for it.  A rare weak pick for Ethan Hawke, who's always interesting to watch. Willem Dafoe - of course!

A little disappointing, but I think I'll be looking out for the Spierig Brothers next film nonetheless.",1280188800,2,1361,4.934497816593886

I love the world they created, everything from small touches like blood coffee to cars decked out for day time travel. The story is simple enough. Obviously in a world where no one dies and no one, for some reason is not breeding humans, the blood supply would run low. In fact we enter at a point where the blood supply will run out within a month. Of course they've seen this coming but instead of breeding humans they are trying to find a blood substitute. Interestingly what they find instead is a cure. And interestingly vampires are somewhat like pigs. Where if they're left without something for awhile, in this case blood, they become feral turning into the winged monsters we've come to expect. Decent story, interesting world, recommended.

District 9 wasn't really about aliens or bugs but was about human prejudice and the bridging of cultural gaps and search for common ground among people in different circumstances.  Daybreakers was similar.  It highlights the depths to which humanity can sink when circumstances in their lives change, threatening their survival.

The action/gore part looks sort of like 28 Days or maybe Resident Evil.  Quite yucky.

I'm used to sunlight either turning them into dust, or burning them horribly. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for something different, but let's not get carried away. Furthermore, they expect the viewers to believe in the end that the cure for vampirism all that time was ""vampire blood"". I wanna know how that's so if the people who were bitten became technically human because that means the vampires who bit them were technically drinking human blood and not vampire blood, and then simply repeating the process. Forgive me, but I found that to be kind of stupid. Don't even get me started on the cast because I'm not an Ethan Hawke fan at all, but he did a fair job.

Instead he tries to find a substitute while his boss, Sam Neill, focuses entirely on getting more humans to feed on. The gore in this movie is way over the top and silly.

I love the Vampire genre. Movies, TV, books, even comics. Every new generation brings its own flavor to the genre, and each one - if researched and presented well - only adds to the basic Vampire story as a whole as new imaginings look at the basic legends that go back to the beginning of time in every culture.

This movie brings something very special into the light: The obvious concept that Vampires are actually no more than parasites and, without their hosts, well, bad things are bound to happen. Without the intervention of The Cure and the interesting spreading circle of destruction so that only those on the outer edge actually survive like a forest fire's leading edge, Vampires would devolve into revenant-type batlike creatures and eventually die out. There are several subtexts in the film: stereotypical corporate greed and military mindlessness, selfishness and selflessness, treating humans like cattle in a visually disturbing way (similar in style to the Matrix ""batteries"") and the rather tenuous veneer of civility that the Vampires seem to want to hold onto, even in their monstrous state.

Daybreakers is really about balance; balance of life, of power, of nature. For a parasitic race, the possibility of the extinction of their ""walking Happy Meals"" and the general Vampiric population's reliance on the government/business to provide them with what they need to prevent a descent into beastly behavior (no hunting? Very civilized indeed) is an obvious analog of today's society. The masses just want their lifestyle maintained and don't particularly care about how that happens. And the rich and powerful do not want to give up their power even in the face of extinction.

Gore, flying body parts, attacks, bodies burning and exploding... the special effects are excellently rendered and entirely believeable and will be too much for many, but their very believability gives the movie a certain amount of credibility; you can't have predators without violence.

The movie itself could have used a few light moments to break up the almost unrelenting drama and it ended rather abruptly; the lack of a denouement leaves some unanswered questions... although the (MAJOR SPOILER) demise of the corporate head, Bromley, is wickedly satisfying.",1277596800,,2287,5.206521739130435
4110449,3,B003CPPY74,"This film was much better than I expected.  I thought it would be another cheesy, typical vampire movie, but it wasn't - mostly due to the reverse vampire psychology used in the film.  Instead of people turning into vampires, it is about vampires turning into humans again.  Plus there is enough suspense, drama and action to keep your interest throughout the duration of the movie.

While the plot and characters are not terribly deep, Ethan Hawks, Willem Dafoe, and Sam Neill are believable in their roles. There are also enough good special effects and diabolical plot twists to really make you think about what it would be like to live in a vampire-dominated world.

The best thing about this film is that it is the ""anti-Twilight"" movie. There are no whining teenage vampires running around in this flick.  Instead, it is filled with more substance and thought-provoking scenes to suck you into its dark, intriguing, sun-deprived world. I also like that this movie leaves you with some hope that humans could make a comeback and overtake the blood thirsty vampire population.

In this movie a epidemic which turned a large number of the Earth's population into vampires broke loose in 2009, most of those uninfected got themselves turned anyway when they saw the perks being a vampire gave them. This has left 95 percent of the world's population as vampires. Now the problem is that with only 5 percent humans left there is not much blood to go around and the movie is about a brilliant vampire scientist who works on developing a blood substitute. One day as he drives home from work he crashes with some fleeing humans, who are now hunted nearly to extinction. Instead of turning them in the scientist decides to help the humans and then begins to question the morality of what vampire society is doing.

I enjoyed this movie allot. It is one of the most original vampire movies I have seen in a while. The acting was is, the visuals is brilliant. If you like vampire films or movies about dark futures then this film is definitely for you. I do however have to complaints about Daybreakers. One is that I would have like to see more of this dark future before the real story of the movie started. In any fantasy and science fiction movie it takes a bit of time to really get into the different world you emerge yourself in through the film. There is so much great things here, little commercials on the TV's and technology which is everyday items which is made to support a vampire society, what we get of the world is great, but I would have liked to see more.

My second complaint is that the gore in the film seam completely out of place. I have nothing against gore in films. I am a long time horror fan. However in this movie there are some scenes where it seams like the gore was just thrown in just to have some gore, it seams out of place.

Except for these two complaints the movie is brilliant. I hate to give a one to five star rating as it is hard to get any details with that. But on a one to ten scale I would give Daybrakers 8 of 9.",1277337600,,2050,4.278350515463917

4110455,3,B003CPPY74,"Daybreakers (The Spierig Brothers, 2009)

I wondered what happened to the Spierig Brothers after the jaw-dropping debut that was Undead back in 2003. Smart, funny, and not seen by nearly enough people, Undead was the perfect blend of 28 Days Later... and Repo Man (yes, trust me on this), and it got me thinking these boys had very, very bright futures in front of them. And then they disappeared. Six years later, we found out they'd come to Hollywood, the destroyer of brilliant overseas directors, and made a surprisingly small-budget vampire flick called Daybreakers. What's more, the critics actually seemed to like the silly thing; it's got a 66% at Rotten Tomatoes, and we're well past the time when that number's going to change much. Could the Spierigs have managed the impossible, carrying their cache through U. S. Customs? Well, not quite, but this certainly could have been a lot worse than it is.

It's 2019, and most of the world is now made up of vampires, who keep the remaining humans in suspended animation as a blood supply. Edward Dalton (Training Day's Ethan Hawke) is a scientist working for a big multinational headed up by Charles Bromley (Event Horizon's Sam Neill), trying to find a cure for vampirism, or at least a blood substitute that doesn't cause its test subjects to melt, explode, or otherwise expire messily. You see, those last remaining humans just don't have enough blood. There's an interesting subplot with a bunch of human resistance fighters headed up by Elvis Cormac (Willem Dafoe, always wonderful) who claim to actually have a cure.

It's quite likable, although once it's over, it feels a bit on the shallow side; it's fun, but empty calories. Still, it's miles better than such brain-dead mess as Legion, released just around the same time. This is in no small part because the Spierig Brothers managed to release this film with some of their dark humor intact. Not much, mind you-- this is no Undead by any means--but you'll get a few chuckles out of it, the action sequences are fun, and the principal actors are all quite good at what they do, if rarely recognized by Hollywood for it. Worth your time if you're a fan of action/horror. ***",1277251200,,2190,4.803713527851459

This is a rather clever turn on things. Vamps outnumber humans so there is a shortage of vamp food. Political dealings try to protect the humans and limit the blood rations to the vamps but things are falling apart fast. Scientists race to find a synthetic blood to both satisfy the nutritional requirements for the vamps and at the same time get the humans out of harm's way. Things aren't going well there either. Then one of the scientists (Ethan Hawke, a vamp himself) gets kidnapped by a group of humans who might have the solution. I won't spoil things but it's a pretty nifty idea and gives good enough reason to revisit the genre.

The problem is in the look and directing of the film. Some real money was spent here to give it a very stylized appearance. Very somber gold tones and lighting prevail over most of the scenes. Many of the shots are composed almost like photographs or paintings. As good looking as this is it also has the effect at holding the viewer at arm's length. I never felt close to the characters or the story. I just had a hard time caring what happened.

I have seen the Spierig brothers' previous outing ""The Undead"" and thought it was OK, but here they missed the mark. They needed less style and a way to dig deeper into the substance. This is not a bad movie by any means. It's imminently watchable and things move along at an even pace. If you gotta put the next vampire movie under your belt then have at it. If not, you won't miss much by missing this.",1277078400,2,1738,4.425
4110457,5,B003CPPY74,"Wow, such a good movie. I think one of the things I enjoyed the most was seeing all the adaptations the Vamps had made to make 'daily life' functional for them. I'm not usually a huge Ethan Hawke fan, but his performance was awesome. And Neill and Defoe, who are a couple of my favorites, did not disappoint.  Seeing the humans in the farming chamber made me think of Matrix, only being farmed for blood instead of electrical power. Also, the mutation that vamps went through after being denied human blood was an interesting twist. And the corporate greed, surviving in the new Vampire society felt like a sad but likely true situation.  The scene where they drag the mutated Vamps into the sun made me think of victims of the Holocaust. If faced with starvation as a race, what would humans do with the poor, the disabled, the mentally handicapped? I shudder to think.  Very thought provoking, great effects, multi layers to story. I would highly recommend this movie.",1276992000,,970,4.694117647058824

4110460,4,B003CPPY74,"Vampires have become the norm but keep cattle around to drink. you want a coffee - you want some sweetener with it. That's the way of the world. The only problem now is that the world is running dry and the hunting is not producing enough to keep people in their needed state. This makes vampires crazy - and when they go crazy they are monstrously sexy and not something a vampire wants to be. to fix this, a cure is being looked for and, in a vampire that wants so much to be human again, hope seems to be coming to bear. Still, there are a lot of hazards for one that wants to become something that many others think of as food or obsolete.

Before I note the problems with this movie, i have to give it props in a lot of places. The ideas were thought out about travel, housing, work, and food. There was a lot of other stuff added in there about food not wanting to be food, too, and about the commodities becoming something like stock. You also have moral dilemmas, good acting, and you have fighting both in and out of the fang-ridden clubs.
But then comes the talk of the cure.

I do not want to ruin anything so I will not say what happens toward the end. i only want to say that the answer you work toward seems like it was thought of quickly and that it was not really the answer it seemed to be. Sure, it works as a Hollywood version to cut to credits, but there are so many holes here. That's what I really hated - the thing that hurt the whole of the project.
you can blame this on the humans, I suppose, and on them screwing up another vampirism in the making.
O, the (in)humanity!

did i like the movie - sure. I liked it BUT I also found it ending abruptly. That is why it gets a 4 BUT really is a 4 because of impact of effects more than anything. If you see it, you will know what I mean by that statement as well.
Should you buy it - I cannot stretch the 4 that far. I can only say watch it, know you might not like the part you see in the last 20 minutes, but that you shouldn't fault everything for this. Happy ending, if you call this a happy one, is what movies seem to strive for these days. Sadly, even horror feels this touch - and that is why you have to forgive it for being mainstreamed because you wouldn't get the budgets you do without that endiing you see.

Starting with: you must be thinking about watching this movie (or buying it for someone), so YOU SHOULD WATCH IT (or buy it).  And buy the Blu-ray version.  As everyone points out, this is a vampire story with some original twists--the chief one being that vampires are the new ""humanity""-after some plague which started with one bat, almost everyone alive is now a vampire, and the dwindling numbers of normal humans left pose the greatest threat to ""society""-ie, the normal human race is about to go extinct and the vampires, (who otherwise act pretty much like people always did) will then be threatened with destruction of their existence, unless they can come up with an acceptable alternative blood supply.  The main character is a ""hematologist""-a practically-oriented hematologist, he's doing research to come up with alternatives to human blood.  This movie is well-acted, well-directed and it has a good sound track, but one of its greatest strengths is the cinematography.  Frankly this is a beautifully filmed movie.  The Blu-ray version allows it to shine in its full potential.  Many compared it to Blade and some other films, but the color palette most strongly reminded me of Resident Evil: Extinction, with the indoors scenes excellently filmed in cool blue lighting and the outdoors scenes filmed in the yellows and oranges of sunlight on the Australian landscape.  Everywhere the cinematography is exquisite.  The tale also unfolds in such a thoughtful fashion that the spasmodic episodes of gory violence come in sharp contrast to the majority of the tale, which gives them a greater impact than they would have if the film had been a simple gore-fest.  The ending was a little bit weaker than I would have liked but hey--this is one of the most beautiful and memorable ""horror"" films that I have seen in a very long time.

4110465,2,B003CPPY74,"After the massive success of the ""Twilight"" movies and books, and their apparent stranglehold over many moviegoers and Hollywood in general; I was beginning to wonder if we would ever get to see a traditional vampire movie. You know, one that abides by the commonly accepted rules of the vampire legends, unlike the aforementioned that ignores most of them whenever possible.

I for one just want to see vampires get a movie that does them justice. Not another one of these overly romantic pieces of drivel that we've been subjected to over the last couple of years. Finally, it seemed the wait was over with the recently released ""Daybreakers"" returning vampires to their customary status of predators of the night. But, was this a proper return to the fearsome creatures we once knew or has all the romance robbed them of their bite?

""Daybreakers"" is set in a world where the majority of the populace has been turned into vampires. For the longest time the vampires have hunted and captured the remnants of humanity for use in their massive blood farming operation; however, because of their insatiable thirst, humanity's numbers have dwindled significantly. As their food source becomes more and more scarce; one vampire scientist, Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke), is working vigorously to develop an alternative sustenance for his brethren before they all begin turning on each other. However, a small batch of human resistance, led by a former vampire (Willem Dafoe) seeks to cure Edward of his curse and in turn show him the way to save the world.

Despite being intrigued by the trailers, the end result of ""Daybreakers"" left me extremely disappointed by the lack of anything interesting or refreshing being brought to the table. The movie, written and directed by The Spierig Brothers (""Undead""), is a hodge-podge of thinly developed stock characters, predictability, a few borrowed ideas, and an inability to ultimately decide to which genre it belonged.

Leading the roster of under-developed characters is actor Ethan Hawke (""Taking Lives""). Personally, I've never really been a big fan of Ethan Hawke or the majority of his movies. He always seems pretentious in every role he plays, and this one is no different. That aside, he does an adequate job as Edward, the film's protagonist, who just so happens to be one of the only vampires that despises being a vampire. His character should have been someone the audience could relate to and root for; however, I for one, could not get interested in anything he was doing over the course of the movie. His character arc is far too slow and meandering, not to mention Hawke brings his typical arrogance to the role which of course didn't help matters.

Fighting alongside Ethan Hawke's character is Wilem Dafoe (""Spider-Man"") as a former vampire turned human. Typically, you can count on Wilem to deliver an entertaining performance to say the least. Beyond that he's hit-and-miss as to whether he's handing in a solid, believable performance or another over-the-top, borderline caricature of the character he was supposed to play. With his portrayal here he keeps his eccentricity in check, resulting in his character coming across as flat and boring. There were some brief moments of entertaining dialogue and/or actions that his character had to do, but for the most part this was one of those times where he should have gone overboard and the character would have been better suited. It's like I said though, he can be hit-and-miss.

The ever-reliable Sam Neill (""Jurassic Park"") takes on the role of the film's primary antagonist and apparent leader of the vampires. While he certainly brings a dignified presence and sense of authority to the role, plus an undeniably malevolent streak; in the end, it's still not enough. The problems arise from his character being of stock quality and simply generic in nature; thus, leaving Sam's talents wasted in the role. Perhaps if the writing/directing team had crafted a more uniquely developed character for Sam, and the other actors as well, to really sink their teeth into, then the outcome could have been so much better than the mediocrity on display.

Speaking of the story, the writer/director team of The Spierig Brothers (""Undead"") seemed to have a decent template for a good vampire movie with ""Daybreakers"". However, like so many other writers and directors have discovered, a good idea does not always pan out as one had hoped, especially when it embraces unoriginality.

The problems with the movie's story begin early on with that troublesome plight of predictability being ever-present. For roughly 75% of the movie I had a fairly accurate idea of where the story was going and what the characters would end up doing. When this occurs, it's a relatively safe bet that the movie is not going to come close to being satisfactory no matter the talent involved. Another cause for the story's predictability was some of the borrowed ideas from movies such as, ""The Matrix"", ""Mad Max"", and even fellow vampire movie ""Blade 2"".

Whenever a movie is too easy to predict based solely on its screenplay, throwing in borrowed ideas only makes the problem all the more evident. Maybe before the Spierig Brothers hatch another movie, they should take the time to really nail down their ideas and do so without stealing from other, more superior movies.

Now I will say that the final 25% of the movie was somewhat less predictable than everything that preceded it. With that being said, while I didn't anticipate some of the events that occurred in the closing moments, I also wasn't pleased with it either. The reason being is that the previous chunk of the movie, although borderline boring to me with its unoriginality, was at least striving to be more of a supernatural thriller rather than a horror film (not a typical genre for vampire movies). That all changed in the movie's final 20 minutes though.

My guess is that the Spierig Brothers remembered they were making a vampire movie, and what's a vampire movie without tons of blood and guts being spilt? So, after over an hour of minimal gore on display, suddenly the screen erupts into chaotic grisly violence and everything in view is now crimson. I'm typically not one to dismiss a movie simply because it's a blood-soaked member of the horror genre; however, when the majority of the movie is relatively tame, such an abrupt switch into horror mode is quite jarring. My opinion is that a movie needs to find a genre and stay in it, be it horror, thriller or whatever, but don't switch at the last minute to meet some blood-spilling quota for vampire movies.

It's disappointing that a movie with decent star power (even with the despicable Ethan Hawke's presence), was hindered by a flimsily conceived story, eliminating any possible hope of entertaining this viewer, at least. It's really too bad, because I was hoping that this would be the movie to redeem the vampire sub-genre from the depths it had sunk too with this whole ""Twilight"" phenomenon. Oh well, there's always next time.

""Daybreakers"" is rated R for violence, language, and gore.",1275696000,8,7114,4.953059513830679
4110466,4,B003CPPY74,"Daybreakers is a breath of fresh, garlic and blood scented air, that steers clear of the recent abomination of sparkly vampires, and holds true to the genre's rich history while still managing an infusion of originality.

When a shortage of blood causes widespread hunger and panic amongst the predominant vampire population of the world, global blood banks - the primary one is run by sinister Bromley Marks (Sam Neill) - begin to ration for survival and plan for a synthetic substitute, headed by Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke), a vampire who shows great empathy for his most likely food source.  Meanwhile, the remaining humans scurry about in the dark like field-mice, hoping to avoid the keen night-vision of the vampire hunters who wish to capture the humans for harvesting.  When Edward runs into crossbow-toting, former vampire Elvis (Willem Dafoe), he takes the steps towards discovering, testing, and implementing a cure.

An accessible plot and adequate direction by the Speirig brothers makes Daybreakers enjoyable, but not overbearing.  With interlaced social commentary (substitute blood for today's oil crises) and similarities to previous vampire movies - most notably the cinematographic stylings of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Collection/dp/B002GSXKNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Collection</a>&nbsp;and the cure for a ""disease"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/B0013FDM7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>&nbsp;- the film is intelligent without unnecessary comedic aspects (although I found the concept of exploding vampire animals causing forest fires to be quite hilarious).  Special effects are a mix of CGI and old-school, with almost enough to satisfy a gore-hound.  Add in an homage to the classic look of Nosferatu vampires and the result is an entertaining addition to the vampire genre, with just enough action and storyline to make up for a lack of character development.

The movie is a gloomy analogy of capitalistic degradation and corporate tyranny...an excellent, memorable ride in the ever increasing vampire genre. Willem Dafoe is brilliant in his supporting role of a hybrid fighter for humanity. Ethan Hawke excels with restraint as the main character...a melancholy, conflicted convert who longs for the purity and freedom of being human, but must exercise extreme caution in his every move. Everything is at stake in this vampiric world of 2019, the euphoria of eternal life comes with ugly consequences, human extinction, and deformed monstrosities. Finding a permanent new blood source is the theme, but being human again is the ""holy grail""...with all its perceived glory and goodness. Claudia Karvan deserves kudos, for her role as one of the leaders of the freedom fighters and Sam Neill slimes with conviction  as a ""bloodthirsty"" CEO (no pun intended). Great special effects, perfect combination and dosage---unusual where most action sci-fi tries to surpass competition with pathetic overdosing of gore and explosions.  One of the special effects that etches itself in your mind is particularly macabre---the corporate facility's blood harvesting scene...repelling and sublimely metaphoric to both present and future humanity.

He is against drinking human blood and human farming, but it must be done. He hates the company he works for, like many of us do!

There is plenty of gore, but it's not really scary. A nice gross-out scene pays homage to The Exorcist, it seems. There is a huge bloodbath close to the finale where literally no one involved in the scuffle is left alive.

4110471,4,B003CPPY74,"Set ten years after vampires abruptly surged in activity, overwhelming the world (no specific flashbacks are shown and details as to the exact nature of the overthrow are sparse; I for one wouldn't mind if a prequel turned out to be in the works), vampires are the world's dominant species and humans are endangered.  The vast majority of un-turned humans are kept in unconcious captivity, farmed for blood, while the remaining humans are hunted down by a vampire military.  Both the hunt for undiscovered pockets of humanity and for a successful, synthesized blood substitute, are in desperate mode as the movie opens.  The reason: the vampires, human-looking and carrying on with humanity's civilzation, are running out of blood from their farmed supplies, and without enough blood are turning into monsterous, mindless beasts.

  Daybreakers begins from the point of view of the vampires, represented chiefly by the character of Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke), one of a large number of vampires sympathetic to the humans (which they all formerly were themselves, at least all the ones we encounter) who abstains from human blood entirely, drinking the less potent blood of animals (which is also becoming scarce).  Edward is one of the main researchers in the drive to create a workable blood substitute, a task that's proceeding slowly and hits a number of grisly walls.  A chance encounter Edward has with some uncaptured humans brings the human side into focus.

  Humans live on the run or in scattered enclaves in isolated areas (one gets the impression that sections of the Earth have been largely depopulated, and that the combined vampire/human population of 2019 may be quite a bit less than the world's current six-and-a-half-billion, although there are still great cities with massive vampire populations).  They're aided by sympathizers from within the vampires's ranks, but continue to see their numbers shrink as the human-hunting vampire squads become more efficient.  Among this particular group of humans is an individual that Edward has never heard of the likes of: an ex-vampire (Willem Defoe) who's somehow become human again.  And therin may lie the key to saving both species: the humans from being hunted to extinction, and the vampires from becoming utterly feral once their blood supply finally runs out.

  Daybreakers does a lot of interesting, quite original things, especially with the whole way a vampire can become human again, and the plot offshoots/side effects that this opens up.  It's also visually impressive, packed with action and gore, and full of neat production touches - stuff they've done with the special effects, with the lighting, camera angles, etc.  There are a few chinks in the overall armor.  Basically, there are times where you just have to accept that not everything adds up neatly (at least to me it didn't).  Not only are the vampire power levels a little inconsistent - at times they seem a lot hardier than humans, but at other times they're kind of too easy to kill; but there are difficulties with seeing how a character on the watch in the middle of a large, semi-desert landscape could be easily snuck up on by an enemy.  Maybe there was a dip in the land, not shown on camera, that the other character carefully crept along.  But that's stretching things even for me, and I usually do pretty good at coming up with possible explanations for seeming incongruities within a movie.  How much does this weaken the movie?  Perhaps surprisingly, not that much.  At least 90% of the movie is very well thought out with believable action and believable story flow.  There happen to also be a few moments where things don't work that well, but sometimes you have to take a couple of shortcomings along with all the good stuff in a movie.  These shortcomings are outweighed many times over by all the things Daybreakers does right.

  Daybreakers is great as a stand-alone movie, although if they want to follow it up, there's certainly lots of places they could go.  Following up with the movie's surviving characters (trying not to reveal which ones those are or aren't, so I won't go on on that point), going into prequel territory (this is one of the relatively few movies that really calls for a prequel - I think it was deliberate how they revealed so little of how the downfall of humanity actually occured), or seeing indepth what's going on somewhere else on the planet (newsreel footage and mentions of England, Japan, etc. are made, but this chapter takes place in America) are all valid possibilities.  With or without a follow-up though, this is a very solid entry in the recent run of vampire movies.",1275177600,,4668,4.951219512195122

The plot felt like a regurgitation of so many earlier movies of this genre and the concept digressed into a very familiar setting.  While I enjoyed many parts of the movie, taken as a whole the story became too predictable and the special effects and gore went over the top.

4110473,4,B003CPPY74,"DAYBREAKERS is a surprisingly refreshing little horror movie.  It's not quite the genre-defying masterwork it's been hailed as (in fact, it relies on a few too many horror cliches), but it's certainly a breath of fresh air: an oddly beautiful, fun film featuring decent acting, spectacular effects, and an interesting premise.

It's 2019.  Vampires rule the world, and they are facing a shortage of human blood supply, their decidedly non-renewable resource.  Edward Dalton (Hawke) is working on a blood substitute; since he takes pity on humans, it's been quite a while since he's had the real thing.  So when he sees his opportunity to help a bunch of humans, he takes it--not knowing that this one act of kindness will catapult him on a race against time to find an actual cure for vampirism.

The film is written/directed by the Spierig brothers, who brought us the delightfully off-kilter zombie flick UNDEAD.  This film features much of what made UNDEAD so enjoyable, though not a sense of humor--DAYBREAKERS is surprisingly dark, and even the funnier bits (vampires taking blood in their coffee, for example) are meant as social satire.  And yet, DAYBREAKERS manages to be fun without being funny, a rare thing these days.  As such, it's a rock-solid production, featuring amazing atmospheric cinematography and good (if not great) performances by Ethan Hawke, Sam Neil (as Edward's boss/nemesis), and Willem Dafoe (as a vampire-hunter named Elvis, who has a few secrets that may change the world).  DAYBREAKERS isn't nearly the film that it could/should be (a satirical horror masterpiece), but it certainly stands out from the usual slop these days.  If you're a fan of the genre, see it.

Of course, you'd think that being a vampire would be much easier than human, especially since vampires control everything.  That isn't the case, all that's happened is that one set of complications (human ones) has been traded for another (vampire ones), and scarcity continues to promote greed and violence.

The vampires are driven, as is always the case, by their need for blood, nothing new about that, but satisfying that need has taken on some new twists.

I don't want to include any spoilers in my review, so I'll sum up by saying that cast played their roles with outstanding restraint, keeping this move from becoming a parody.

4110478,3,B003CPPY74,"Vampires are everywhere. It seems at least 3-4 vampire movies come out a year(thanks to crappy Twilight)and most suck. Take for instance The Vampire's Assistant, it was awful. Hollywood is treating vampire movies as after school specials in light of Twilight's sucksess. However, Daybreakers shows some potential but still falls a little short.

Set in a post viral outbreak world in 2019, Edward (Hawke) plays a reluctant vampire who is a hematologist at a blood farming factory. He is hoping to find a synthetic substitute for blood in an effort to solve the shortage crisis and stop the hunting of humans. In a fateful car accident, he runs into a band of humans who may have found a cure. Edward soon finds himself caught up in corporate lies, military  operations and betrayal. The fate of the human race is in his hands.

Sounds pretty good, right? The problem, is that it is only 90 minutes long. Character development is thrown at you like bullets from a military vampire's machine gun. Yet, this a much better vampire movie effort and deserves some praise. 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is still one of the best modern vampire movies to date, I recommend it to anyone who is sick of teenie-bopper like vampire films.

NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: An excellent disc. The film is very dark, and that is where the power of blu ray lies. Images are sharp and clear even in pitch blackness. Wonderful sound and decent special features. FINAL THOUGHTS: A must own for fans.",1274400000,3,1463,4.703125
4110479,5,B003CPPY74,"In the year 2017 a virus has wiped out nearly half of the human population that transforms them into vampires with humans being harvested for blood even hunted down, some humans are even hunting down to kill off these undead creatures who are taking over the world. Two years later, in a major city it seems Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) is a vampiric scientist who works at a major human blood manufactoring company run by corporate bosshog named Charles Bromley (Sam Neil) but feels bored of life and of being a vampire as he feels like he wants to be human again. However he meets a band of humans lead by Elvis (William Dafoe) and Audrey (Claudia Karvan) who are part of an underground human resistance in trying to find a cure as his luck is in hand as Elvis was a former vampire who found an unusual cure which is a bit of sunlight with being wet thus can change him back to human as his blood is a cure if he got bitten but can't change back as it can do the same to other vampires even to Edward as they must try to cure the vampires of the world back to normal.

Excellent and action packed yet original Sci-fi horror thriller from the creators of the suprisingly good Australian Zombie Sci-fi import ""Undead"" known as the brothers Michael and Peter Spierig is one of the best vampire movies in recent memory. This one brings vampires back to being dark rather than heroes (ala Blade, Edward Cullen or Angel) as this one is a modern take on Richard Matheson's I Am Legend story but has an original concept about vampires taking over the world and humans trying to find a cure to restore humanity back on it's feet. There's plenty of gore here such as exploding heads and bodies which won't disappoint, decent acting mainly by Dafoe who never fails at bad acting and the film is a metaphor on the whole Phoenix story about being dead rising from the ashes to be reborn sort of thing which the filmmakers were aiming for as they succeeded but the ending to this movie leads for a possible sequel which i hope to see as this has a potential to be a cult fave.

Best way to approach this, is imagine humanity on a global scale, are vampires. That is the normal order of life.  Now, you can use animal blood in a short term substitute, but human blood is needed to sustain your life, let alone sanity and physical normality.  Think of your local coffee shop now named ""StarBlood"".  Suddenly, human blood farms are about bankrupt and humans go underground.  Blood substitutes are not working and the rush is on to find a way to continue ""living"".

4110481,4,B003CPPY74,"In the horror genre one of the most talked about characters is the vampire. They've gone from horrendous creatures of the night with leathery wings to sophisticated socialites that just tend to drink a drop or two of blood. In the TWILIGHT films, they've become the obsession of teen girls (and secretly their mothers as well) around the world. But now and then a new take on the old character arrives on film and such is the case with DAYBREAKERS.

DAYBREAKERS begins in a world far different than our own. The year is 2019 and rather than humans being the norm these days vampires are in control of everything.  They're in charge of the military, the government and big business. But it's not just the elites who are vampires, it is almost everyone. Humans are now the endangered species.

But the blood flow is slowing down. Humans that have been harvested for years in what looks like a cow farm on steroids are depleting and dying out. And with fewer humans to feed on, vampires are beginning to change as well. Feeding on their own or themselves, they begin to change into a different type of vampire, a subsider. These vampires look more like the legendary creatures with large wings, leathery skin and outrageous fangs.

At a multinational corporation owned by Charles Bromley (Sam Neill), their chief hematologist Ed Dalton (Ethan Hawke) is searching for a blood substitute that vampires can live in. To date all attempts have failed and one viewed onscreen results in a gooey gore filled moment. Ed wants humans and vampires to co-exist but without a blood substitute there is little hope of it happening.

Ed's brother feels differently. It was Frank (Michael Dorman) who changed Ed long ago. Ed's birthday celebration with Frank is far from festival and as the two brothers argue, Ed's home is invaded by a subsider. Once more blood flows freely as the subsider is subdued. But the image of the poor creature, once as close to human as Ed is, makes him more determined than ever to find a cure. Because once the human blood supply is gone, this is what all vampires will turn into.

A chance encounter in a traffic accident results in Ed meeting a group of humans on the run. But this chance encounter will change his life as the woman in charge named Audrey (Claudia Karvan) sets up a meeting with Ed and the leader of the humans, Elvis (Willem Dafoe). Through Elvis, Ed learns that there is indeed a cure, but even this group is unsure of how it works or how to reproduce it. With Ed's help they might find the answers.

Of course Frankie foils that from happening by leading an assault team to capture Ed and the humans. On the run, the escape to a new locale but that too is eventually found by the vampires. With little or no time to find the solution, Ed and his group must stay off the grid and find the solution to their problem before the vampires change.

Unfortunately this doesn't coincide with the plans of Bromley. It seems that the whole search for a cure was a farce and that Bromley is more businessman than beast. His whole take on the situation is a means of making more money, huger profits. And with a new blood substitute he's come across, the world can remain a place for vampires and a dark day for humans.  The only person standing in his way now is Ed and his group of on the run humans.

This movie offers a whole new take on a tired genre, giving it new life if you will. The entire world filled with vampires and humans' holding up in locations to hide makes for a chilling thought. No longer are we at the top of the food chain.

But the world in this film isn't safe for the monsters either. The vampires are given a glimpse of what they will become once the blood peters out. And that is not a pretty sight for anyone to see.

The cast does a tremendous job here, making their roles seem real. Hawke shows a nice side here, playing a man chained to a way of surviving while searching for another. Ed doesn't truly want to continue living, but the hope of finding a solution keeps him going.

Dafoe always does a great job. His Lionel ""Elvis"" Cormac is one tough dude while at the same time a compassionate man who does what he can to help any other humans he finds. The rest of the group does an equally fine job and Neill plays the cold hearted executive quite well.

For fans of horror this will be a film not to be missed. Filled with gore and jump scenes, it will keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat. At the same time we are offered an intelligent look at a group trying to save the world from the now dominant form. It's rare that a combination of smarts and scares achieves what it sets out to do. DAYBREAKERS does this in spades and is worth watching.",1274140800,,4716,4.430715935334873

Just now doing like a little nighttime reading and came across that delicious quote which reminded me of this vampire flick. Vampires have always been symbolic of the wealthy.
*spoilers*
In Daybreakers you get your corporate variety bloodsuckers of the contemporary age. The story is set in the very near future and like all science-fiction and stories set in the future it's about us and our time.
A virus that will maybe remind you of hiv has turned almost the whole world into vampires. Ethan Hawke is our protagonist and he's sorta like the introspective, sensitive Brad Pitt vampire in Interview w/ the Vampire. (In other words he has doubts about himself and wonders about the morality of killing people for food.)
Hawke works as a top researcher for a soulless vampire corporation that is supposed to be trying to find a ""cure""... Of course they really aren't --and I would like to know why on Earth would you want a cure for immortality?? But anyway the Big Pharma/slash Tyson Foods corporation just wants return customers (maybe like w/ Aids??? Hmmmm).
Meanwhile the myopic morons, headed by a delightfully ghoulish executive, Sam Neill, somehow used up all the human stock that didn't turn to vampires and were the vital food source....
(Using up resources just like our brilliant captains of industry and politicians in our world you see.)
They never heard of factory farms I guess. Give the humans their own colonies to breed and feed 'em lots of fast food and give them Apple ipads, Play Station 5s, sports, beer, designer clothing and name brand products and they'll be happy to give their blood to you. Drain them regularly -but just enough so they'll stay alive to give you more-. DUH.
Hawke meets up with the human resistance and a blue collar grease monkey William Defoe who's re-transformation back to mortal holds the key to ruining the party. Or I mean to saving the world. I don't get how nobody discovered this obvious as the day is bright cure before.

You know the plot is less than mind-blowing would be the point I'd want to drive home by detailing it all. Skip all that noise.

You get some cool visual treats and some mildly interesting touches to this vampire flick like (but you already know and if you don't I'd recommend not further spoiling the movie):
-the regular vampire-in-sunlight burning flesh
-lots of blood if you like that
-there are really cool shots of vampire city scenes. Vampires are the regular people you see
-to make travel convenient there are networks of tunnels to use during daylight hours and cars are equipped w/ shields and are operated with cameras and screens to view the road from safely inside...
-when the vampires starve from lack of blood they revert to a Nosferatu style vampire, starting at first with the ears turning into pointed bat ears. Very Cool.
-Now a HIGHLIGHT of Daybreakers, and one of the best scenes ever in a vampire flick, is this glorious slow motion orgy of death in which paramilitary security officer vampires transform back into humans as wave after wave is then devoured by the remaining bloodsuckers. The vampires turn back into human after consuming the ""tainted"" blood of their already turned brothers who in turn are eaten alive.

SO, Worth the rent.

- The ending is a surprise to me which is entertaining.

- There is also a psychological twist where a father killed his own daughter.

- The special effects are mixed. There are some very scary scenes such as when one of the vampires transformed into a big bat with human head and attacked the main character. The special effects here are lively.

In other scenes, they look amateurish. I could clearly see the actors were wearing masks to disfigure their faces.

- The director could have spent more time on the father/daughter issue to make this movie a little emotional. This issue was dealt with briefly. As a result, the movie had no lingering emotion. I did not feel threatened or scared for the human characters most of the time. I was scared only in a few scenes. I followed the film till the end mainly because of curiosity.

A few are actually pretty good most are how much gore can be thrown in or just t***-n-a** (soft porn). Daybreakers has a good story and thankfully leaves the romance on the edges. But that is all. The movie drags and never takes the story anywhere. As fore the gore... Vampires are not ghouls, zombies or the occasional messy werewolf. Vampires drink blood, they do not eat or rip the body into meaty chunks. The gore does not equal scary. The scariest thing about a vampire is its ability to blend into society while still remaining the predator and separate from society. Gore should be left to the Jasons and Freddys out there. There really is nothing new in Daybreakers. It repackages ideas from different movies into one; finding a cure (The Breed),corporate greed (most recent Avatar), mans inhumane acts against his fellow man ( any movie where one group lessons the value of another over differences), and a few others. Overall it's not one of the worst movies out there, but also, its not one of the best out there.

Establish a vampiric swat team to hunt down the remaining humans and harvest them for their blood.  Ethan Hawke works as a hematologist for a pharmaceutical conglomorate run by a evil vampire CEO played by Sam Neill. Hawke is a reformed vampire who has given up drinking blood and to curb his appetite for neck juice-he takes up smoking cigarettes. But not to worry about his blackened lungs, later on when he realizes a way to regain his pulse and heartbeat-he quits smoking. But wears a nicotine patch. (Sorry I couldn't resist the nicotine patch remark)

Daybreakers has some interesting ideas but goes nowhere with them. One cute scene takes place at a coffee shop where a group of vampires are waiting in line for their morning cup of java and blood. One grouchy vampire(probably got out of the wrong side of the coffin that morning)complains to the clerk that she gypped him on the amount of blood she added to his coffee and a small riot ensues broken up by the vampire swat team.

But then again none of the characters in this movie are worth caring about and Ethan Hawke, a graduate of the Keanu Reeves Academy of Acting hasn't many facets to his character unless you count mumbling and smoking.

4110489,3,B003CPPY74,"Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) is a reluctant vampire in a world where humans have become rare.  It's a clever idea: if there really were vampires and they could spread like a virus, why wouldn't they soon run the world rather than slink around in shadows?  It turns out this film shows exactly why, if they're smart, vampires would stay out of sight and wouldn't want to spread.  Vampires do rule the world in this film, and human beings are the ones who have to creep about during the day, hidden as best they can from their refined and powerful predators.  The problem is that the vampires are running out of humans to harvest, and without human blood they gradually devolve into something darker and more demonic, Nosferatu-style bat-like beasts with no trace of remaining humanity.

The execution is not perfect.  The dialogue is full of cliches, and the final solution is all too convenient.

As it is, this is a moderately entertaining vampire flick that's different enough to be worth watching for fans of the genre and engaging and accessible enough to be a decent way for the rest of us (at least those who aren't overly squeamish) to kill a couple hours.

4110492,4,B003CPPY74,"Blood, blood everywhere and not a drop to drink. Never ones for subtly (at least so far) the Spierig brothers present us with a shift on the vampires on the loose saga with ""Daybreakers"". What the film lacks in subtly ""Daybreakers"" more than makes up for with action, tongue-in-cheek (at times campy)humor and some ingenious touches. I wouldn't call ""Daybreakers"" a thoughtful, deep film but then there are a place for those type of flicks. This isn't one of them.

Blood, blood everywhere and not a drop to drink. Humanity has been turned into vampires and human beings are on the verge of extinction. Scientist Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) has been trying to find a blood substitute so that there will be no more blood farms. Edward's boss (Sam Neill in a deliciously evil performance)favors a blood substitute for the masses because it will keep his company in business but wants to ""keep"" genuine human blood for the elite. The problem is that the substitue kills vampires. When a human resistence group led by Elvis (Willem DaFoe in a campy fun performance)contact Edward for his help in finding a cure to vampirism--a cure that Elvis somehow experienced--Edward's all for it because he hates being a vampire and preying on humanity.

Clever, filled with action, some stunning evening photography and nice performances ""Daybreakers"" will never be mistaken for ""The Hurt Locker"" or even ""Avatar"" but it is darn entertaining. The writing and direction by the Spierig brothers throws in enough imaginative twists and turns to keep us ordinary humans entertained. For what it's worth there is a solid allergory here about the oil crisis, health care crisis or any number of those situations where we're running out of stuff at the core of the film. You can also look at it as pure entertainment with a bit of a conscience. I have to say those who are critical of this film remind me of those that missed the boat when it came to the talent of people like Sam Raimi when he made the ""Evil Dead"" movies (which were admittedly far more over the top). The Spierig brothers had clear talent and a brilliant visual flair that makes ""Daybreakers"" fun to look at, too. Heck, the film looks far more expensive than its budget.

The Blu-ray version looks very good with a crisp presentation filled with inky, deep and detailed blacks.

The special features are likewise terrific; we get a fun commentary track from the brothers (who clearly love doing things the old fashioned way with physical effects where possible using CGI only when they needed to achieve something difficult or to stay in budget).

""The Making of 'Daybreakers'"" is a two hour documentary that details just about every aspect of the production.

""The Big Picture"" is a 2000 short film the brothers made to demonstrate their visual flair.

We also get poster art, bonus view animatics and storyboards as a pop up feature. We also get the theatrical trailer.

It's refreshing to see aa flick as inventive, campy and fun as ""Daybrakers"" (which reminds me of something George Romero might have made back-in-the-day with more money or something that John Carpenter might have tackled)without any truly hidden agenda or the emasculated vampires of ""Twilight"".

This breath of fresh air may consist of ultra-violent acts of blood-letting and some horrifying-looking vampires (as opposed to the teen emo kind found in Twilight), so in that regard, there really isn't much room to complain with what you get here.  With that out of the way, Daybreakers takes place in the not too-distant future where nearly every human on the planet has been transformed into a vampire, and the race as a whole is faced with the imminent reality that their blood supply is dwindling, along with the small human population as well.  Vampire hematologist Edward (Ethan Hawke) works for evil vamp head honcho Bromley Marks (Sam Neill) and is trying to find a solution for an alternate feeding source, until he comes into contact with a human named Elvis (Willem Dafoe) who has somehow been cured of his vampirism.  As said before, Daybreakers doesn't break any new ground, nor does it try to either.  What it does do is feature some interesting ideas, a surprisingly great cast, and some just plain awesome effects work as well.

It's a movie that clearly has more creativity behind it than it had budget, but was a labor of love for it's creators.  The main problem with the film is that its concise length and solid pacing actually hurt the narrative somewhat, as it confidently blows through more material than most movies twice its length cover.

The features are what makes the blu-ray though.

They have made the world fit their needs but they have turned so many that the problem is they have exhausted the human blood supply and now the poorer Vampires are turning into monsters while our reluctant hero works on a blood substitute.

Such a promising beginning in a visual setting. Enter the human resistance and things are still o.k. but start sliding downhill and all of a sudden it happens and the movie looses track and pace and becomes I know not what. Some kind of drama that it was ill suited for and there it stays on track in a bad way with very little going for it.

After such a promising and good start I felt duped at the end and might just as well skipped seeing it through. Just as with the blood levels in the Vampires coffee which we are shown that constantly drop (now serving 25% blood - Now serving 5% blood etc) so too does the quality of the movie go down. I'll give it 2 stars for the fantastic start even if I am not sure if the whole deserves so much. If you are unsure rent it first.",1272585600,2,1072,4.173913043478261
4110498,5,B003CPPY74,"To be entertained. And that's what this movie does- it ensures your entertainment for its runtime.

A good vampire movie is almost a rarity these days. Err, that's an understatment. A good vampire ANYTHING is a rarity these days. Ever since the Twihard movement exploded we've beem getting tons of OC-With-Wampires things. It is rather sad; I love vampires as much as the next guy and I'll be honest when I say that I began to lose that love when Twilight came out. And I almost CRINGED seeing the trailer- I thought it looked cool but just like a poor man's Blade Runner with vampires.

Well when I saw this movie, I found out how wrong I was.

Right now this movie has a love it or hate it thing- I like that. It shows that movies don't have to be for everyone. That they have audiences of their own.

Edward (not Cullen) is a vampire who works for a blood farming company. His brother is a police officer hellbent for finding humans. There are very few humans left- and a very small amount of blood. Blood is running low. Companies are now reducing the amount of blood they offer with certain products.

However, Edward doesn't like being a vampire. He doesn't like the fact that he has to drink the blood of people to keep his belly full. And he misses being able to experience the sun. After coming across a group of humans one night, he takes interest in them and eventually has a meeting set up with former vampire Lionel (played by Willem Dafoe), a human, and together he and the humans plan to turn vampires back to humans.

This is why we go to the cinema- so we can be entertained. This movie did just that. For 100 minutes, it provided some nice scares, gore, and action to add to the fun, not to mention it had a well placed amount of humor. Sure the CG effects are a bit cheesy, and it's definitely no Avatar when it comes to SFX- but that is the point. But the overall look of the film is very gorgeous- it was a total doozie in the theater. The tinted blue looks gorgeous and the night scenes are crisp, and nice to watch.

Also, the political aspect is also a brilliant factor. Vampires being a metaphor for politics. Blood being a metaphor for OIL. This movie is very symbolic of how the government is greedy as hell when it comes to oil. And also, the best part is the last 15 minutes- they fed their greed, and as a result, their greed cost them dearly.

In short, this movie is a near perfect vamp flick. It wastes no time getting straight to the point, it just gives us what we came to see. If you like vampire movies, this is a must for sure.",1269648000,20,2565,4.285123966942149

But seriously, it's hard to find anything to gripe about with Daybreakers.  This movie is has a lot of class in a time where tons of vamp movies are coming out, and though many of them I enjoy on a campy level, few can be considered quality.  Daybreakers pretty much has it all, action, spooks, gore, sci-fi, original concept, great performances, tight script and it stays always a little ahead of you.  It's great to see Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe and Sam Neil doing such a fun and successful project together.  Bravo to all.",1269043200,9,615,4.513513513513513
4110500,4,B003CPPY74,"DAYBREAKERS is a fresh take on the average vampire horror tale, bordering on camp, but definitely original. Quite unexpectedly, my husband and I really enjoyed this film. In DAYBREAKERS, we find that the human race was nearly destroyed by a plague, but vampires gave them a way out.  Now vampires are the dominant species on earth, night and day are reversed, vampires are going about their normal ""nightly"" routines, and the remaining humans are hunted fugitives. There are so few humans remaining that a blood shortage is causing the vampires to panic, and the vampires have initiated a massive R&D effort to create a synthetic substitute.  if they don't find it, the vampires will mutate horribly and die.  But there may be an alternative.  One that will change the world of the vampires forever.

If, like me, you find vampire horror films (not teen angst films) to be a guilty pleasure, then I think you will enjoy DAYBREAKERS.  Part I Am Legend, part Buffy, part Blade (but all with a twist), DAYBREAKERS brings a unique and creative story to the average vampire flick.  The plot is intriguing, and the ending is surprising.  The special effects appropriately scary and interesting, the blood and gore as to be expected, and lore within the film is consistent.  The acting is not the best I have seen, but it is not the worst either.

For a fresh take on an old genre, give DAYBREAKERS a try.  You might be glad you did.",1268611200,53,1426,4.709677419354839
4110501,3,B003CPPY74,"This was a film I went to see not really expecting that much. If anything I expected it to fit in with the typically bland trend of Vampire movies that seem to be growing in quantity in recent years. Daybreakers, however, adds something new to the agenda while taking advantage of the growing trend that has swept the Western world. Ethan Hawke is an actor with a very familiar name, but is someone you don't see very frequently on the big screen. Possibly his biggest role in the movie Training Day is the only film of his I can honestly say with conviction that I enjoyed from start to finish. I wasn't expecting Daybreakers to be an addition to my Ethan Hawke fan club list of great movies but it was one I found genuinely entertaining is one wouldn't mind watching again.

The story is set in the year 2019 and a virus has spread across the world turning much of the world's human population into Vampires. As a consequence of this, their is a shortage of human blood and the Vampire race are frantically looking for an alternative or they will all soon turn into what they call `sub-siders' which are mutated, bat-like creatures driven by their hunger much like zombies. Edward Dalton (Hawke) is a haematologist whose job it is to discover that alternative and is driven by his own compassion for the human race. His employer, the company Bromley Marks headed by Charles Bromley (Sam Neill) is a greedy corporation, looking for the best way to retain its profits in this time of need. Dalton is in a race against time, to find an alternative to human blood before everyone he knows, including him, succumbs to the curse of a hunger for human blood. He must do this with the help of the Vampires natural enemy, the Human.

This is really a genuinely enjoyable film. The futuristic effects are well done and the fact that they have retained the Vampire myths such as having no reflection makes it that much cooler. The Speirig brothers have managed to create a believable world in which you can imagine Vampires living and thriving as they go about their daily lives without having to hunt humans themselves. The acting of Hawke, Neill and Dafoe are well done in their respective roles, yet Neill is the more terrifying character in the film. He presents an aura about him which makes the character automatically an intimidating foe for the cause of Dalton. The film has an apocalyptic air to it that, although the human race has essentially died out, you become concerned for the survival of the Vampire race whilst still wanting the humans to take back what is theirs.

It's a good film that, although not an Oscar winner, serves its purpose in entertaining the viewer for its entire runtime.",1268092800,3,2697,4.638075313807532
4110502,3,B003CPPY74,"Daybreakers had all the ingredients of a film that should be loved by any horror fan. First and foremost, it's a new vampire movie that isn't Twilight. On top of that, it's R-rated so it doesn't pull any punches when it comes to blood and gore (and trust me, there's quite a bit). It also offers a bit of a new twist on what was otherwise exhausted when it comes to stories relating to vampires. With all that being said, however, it still wasn't as good as it should have been.

The story is the film's strong point, but is still pretty flawed. Humans being farmed for blood and dying out is a great concept. The cure is rather different and unique than what you've become used to in vampire films, which lead to an interesting third act. The ending is probably where the film could potentially make someone dislike the film. Not everyone is going to like the finale, but it was a nice change of pace to not have the same recycled storyline or ending for once.

Regarding the acting though, there isn't much of it. Willem Dafoe shows a little personality and has a one-liner or two that will get a few laughs. Sam Neill also shows some signs of life and fits the role as the main villain of the film rather well. Every other character felt rather flat and showed no depth at all. While the blood used in the film was a fantastic color, some of the special effects seemed rather cheesy at times. Mainly the scene where a vampire is hanging from the ceiling fighting Ethan Hawke and his brother comes to mind. The cuts were quick, which seemed to try and cover up the fact, but it still stuck out. That may be nitpicking a bit since it was pretty top notch the rest of the time. The Underworld films (at least the first two) come to mind as they left the same kind of bitter aftertaste and seemed to suffer similar problems.

It's a shame Daybreakers didn't live up to its potential. It contains a strong cast and delivers an original take on something that's been associated with horror for nearly 200 years. The acting is what seems to hurt the film the most though since the way everyone says their lines makes it seem like they don't want to be there. It's still worth viewing, but you may want to rent before buying. In all honesty, it may be worth supporting just to get an R-rated vampire film a bit more recognition and slightly dim the spotlight currently shining on whatever teenage vampire franchise is currently taking off for whatever reason.",1266278400,2,2454,4.4368070953436805
4110503,4,B003CPPY74,"The US, 2019: Ed Dalton (Ethan Hawke) is a man with a singular problem. As a Hematologist at Bromley Marks, the world's primary supplier of blood supplies to the world, Ed has been tasked with finding an artificial blood substitute. On paper this doesn't seem to be a job of world-shattering importance - until one considers that Ed, along with 99% of the world's population, has been transformed into a vampire by a virus which ravaged the world a decade previously, that the vampire population of the world now far exceeds that of the remaining fugitive human population, and that to be deprived of blood causes one to degenerate into a feral bat-like creature, known colloquially as a ""subsider"", that feeds indiscriminately on vampire and human alike, that the truly toothsome nature (pun intended) of Ed's problem can really be appreciated.

In many ways, ""Daybreakers"", directed by the Spierig brothers, feels like a quasi-sequel to Richard Matheson's classic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/B001JE25ZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>. Extrapolate the speculative society from the end of that novel ten or twenty years into the future (and minus the blood and virus pill) and you have the tantalising concept of this film. In fact there are several blink-and-you'll-miss-them references to that genre-defying work throughout the film. Those familiar with the anaerobic nature of Matheson's ""vampire virus"" will no doubt smile knowingly to themselves as a pivotal character describes a profound redefinition of their vampiric biology as feeling ""like the air rushed back into me"".

But what really sets this film apart from the crowd is it's invention: The evocation of a post-human, vampire-run world is beautifully executed and has been very well thought through. Our vampires drive to work in Chryslers equipped with cameras and polarized windows (for that oh-so-decadent day time drive); sip Coffee with 20% blood; and, we are informed via a CNN style news broadcast, are advised to steer well clear of forests due to the vampiric Avian population's proclivity to accidentally ignite forest fires whilst attempting to fly during daylight hours. Similarly, everyone seems to chain-smoke, which initially seems odd until one realizes that smoking is a risk-free pastime for the immortal.

In many ways, the film can be read as a metaphor for the world's dependence on oil and infatuation with consumer capitalism, but, thankfully, the Spierig's do not labour this subtext and are content to leave it floating on the surface of their sanguine soup to be digested as the audience prefers. Performances are for the most part excellent: Hawke makes a suitably haunted protagonist; Sam Neill imbues his villainous free-market obsessed lead with an air of mordant sympathy, and, some questionable fifties Hot-Rodder affectations aside, Willem Dafoe is enigmatic and amusing as a character who may or may not be the focal point of the film (and on the strength of this, how I wish someone would give Dafoe a run at playing Bob Neville in a decent screen adaptation of ""I Am Legend"").

There are a lot of bad Vampire movies and TV series out there; lets be honest, the whole genre has become massively overblown due to the mystifying popularity of Stephanie Meyer's singularly awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B002KGVB8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>&nbsp;series. Do yourself a favour though and watch this film. It is everything that the vampire genre can be and yet so often isn't due to a lack of creativity and imagination on the part of writers and directors (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood-The-Complete-First-Season-HBO-Series/dp/B001FB4W0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)</a>&nbsp;for another prime example of possibility squandered. How I wish HBO would ditch that gratuitous nonsense and option ""Daybreakers"" as an ongoing series instead), and, even more importantly, it features a Vampire called Edward who doesn't suck!",1266105600,2,4179,5.768233387358185
4110504,3,B003CPPY74,"I won't make this a long review, there are plenty of those on these pages already!

Instead I'll tell you the good and the bad.

The good:  Obviously this film had a nice budget, and they spent that on some acting talent.  It always helps when performances are strong.  Secondly it wasn't shot on DV, so at least it's ""filmic"".

The bad:  Some have commented that this is a new twist on the vampire tale - but honestly, it's not.  All they did was reverse the roles - humans for vampires.  Clever?  Hardly.  Then they grafted on a really poor (and telegraphed) evil capitalist slant: the standard evil corporation that is greedy, and nothing else - and wants what is best for the bottom line, not the people.  Seriously, if you haven't figured this out before 145 minutes of the film has run, you probably haven't seen many films.

So, it's a new angle, but the emperor has no clothes.  It's really the same old thing (see 20 Days Later etc.) except more actors are wearing fangs.

Some good moments though.  If they had concentrated on the battle between those starving and those not it might have been better.  But the tired corporation thing just let the air out of it.

Overall, a 3 out of 5 because of some good set pieces, a nice budget, and some decent actors.",1265932800,2,1267,4.434782608695652
4110505,4,B003CPPY74,"I enjoyed the movie; I left the theatre thoroughly creeped out! It's seen primarily from the viewpoint of Ethan Hawke's character, who is not very happy with his vampire-status (hence, Interview with the Vampire).  The vampires are coming to an end because of the lack of humans to feed them, so either a surrogate or a cure for the vampire-virus must be found (I am Legened -ish).  Ethan Hawke wants a cure, but his overseerers really want a surrogate (a fact that becomes very relevant in the end).  I won't say anything else because it would really spoil it all, but I was entertained.  I think if you're not looking for something earth-shattering, you will be, too.  For one, this didn't dwell on how we get to be vampires, which was great for the other films, but it's been done A LOT.  For another thing, the jump-out-and-make-you-scream factor was cool.  I'm not usually a fan of that stuff - it feels like a cheap thrill as opposed to something I go home and think about and scare myself.  What made this good for me was that it was well done.  I wasn't the only one in the theatre who screamed, nor was I the only female.  ;-)  I go to movies to get away from reality: not everything has to be perfectly laid out to be entertaining for me.  I don't like HUGE plot holes, etc., but for me, this flowed and made sense for the most part.

It seems clear that the filmmakers intended to use this plot device to shine a critical light on contemporary human civilization and they choose to indulge in some pretty lurid scenarios; Corporate greed, The farming of humans for food, Unjust use of military force, The purging of social deadweight to name a few.
Driving it all is a 'crisis of the commons'. The 'wild' human population is nearly gone, blood prices are going up and only the elite and their pets can stave-off the awful transformations that befall vampires who starve.

While out for a day-drive, a vampiric Willem Dafoe discovers a cure when a freak accident sends him flying through is blacked-out windshield, exposing him to just enough solar radiation to scorch him human again before he's quenched in a storm drain.
Born-again christians might appreciate the image of the sun purifying a man with a traumatic blast - unless they are the kind who take things literally.
Dafoe's born-again human character definitely has a bit of 'country charm' about him in stark contrast to the slick urban vampires which adds another layer of contextualisation for viewers to engage with.

In tone it's reminiscent of ""Snowpiercer"". Lurid, violent and laden with metaphor.
