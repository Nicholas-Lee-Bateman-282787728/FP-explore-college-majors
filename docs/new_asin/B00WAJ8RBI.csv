Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

""Tomorrowland"" has been one of Disney's futuristic theme land concepts featured at five different Disney theme parks throughout the world over the years. The film is an attempt to mine that concept and begins with young inventor, Frank Walker, visiting the 1964 World's Fair to show off his jet pack invention to David Nix, a renowned inventor who is awarding cash prizes for new inventions. Frank's invention is a dud; upon demonstration he is unable to make it fly and is dragged around on the ground after starting up the ineffective jet packs. That opening sequence is designed to be humorous but is too far-fetched to be taken seriously (yes ""Tomorrowland"" is supposed to be a fantasy but it starts out in the real-life context of the '64 World's Fair).

Soon, much like the classic ""Wizard of Oz,"" Frank finds himself transported to a fantastic world, ""Tomorrowland,"" after following a spunky young girl, a Brit by the name of ""Athena,"" who beckons him to take a ride boat into the ""It's a Small World"" exhibit. The ride leads him to somehow be transported via a space pod to the futuristic ""Tomorrowland,"" which bears a striking resemblance to one of Disney's futuristic theme lands.

Cut to the film's protagonist, Casey Newton, whose father is a NASA engineer. While attempting to sabotage machines that will take down the launch platform (the space program at Cape Canaveral is being shut down due to a lack of funding), Casey is arrested but bailed out by her father. Athena manages to leave a ""lapel pin"" which enables her to be transported to ""Tomorrowland"" when she touches it. This is perhaps the neatest cinematic bit in the entire film as Casey finds herself flipping back and forth between two worlds in an instant, simply by touching the pin.

You would think that the bulk of ""Tomorrowland"" is set in the futuristic city but you'll soon discover that the bulk of Act 2 machinations occurs on earth. It's as if ""Dorothy"" spent more time in ""Kansas"", than the ""Emerald City."" Act 2 is very much a string of derivative chase sequences. First, Casey ends up at a science-fiction memorabilia retailer in Houston who she discovers is looking for the magical lapel pin. Athena must save her from the two proprietors who turn out to be robots, looking to destroy Athena (who also turns out to be a robot).

The chase continues when men who claim to be Secret Service agents try to kill Casey and destroy Athena. These agents are also robots and resemble characters from ""Men in Black."" Athena deposits Casey at the home of the now grown Frank Walker, who lives as a recluse in upstate New York. Frank is played by George Clooney and attempts to play a ""Doc Brown"" kind of part from ""Back to the Future."" Unfortunately, Clooney is too identified as a heartthrob or suave criminal and does not have the acting chops to pull off the part of an eccentric scientist.

Clooney manages to dispatch the ""Men in Black"" robots mainly by activating various booby-traps in his house. Before you know it, Casey, Frank and Athena are magically transported via a teleportation machine to France where they take off in a rocket ensconced inside the Eiffel Tower. Before launching, Frank explains that the four mannequins of Edison, Tesla, Verne and Eiffel honor those four inventors who started a secret group, Plus Ultra, who discovered the dimension which eventually led to the founding of ""Tomorrowland.""

The third act finally brings us back to the ""Emerald City,"" so to speak. What originally seems like a flick for teenagers morphs into a convoluted sci-fi story, designed for adults. It turns out that Nix is now the governor and has been broadcasting ""warnings"" to people on earth about a future apocalypse. Nix soon realizes that his ""warnings"" are not being heeded and said messages are actually becoming a self- fulfilling prophecy that will end in the actual destruction of earth in 58 days, more or less.

The next sequence of events are difficult to follow. Suffice it to say that the ""tachyons,"" which enable a glimpse into the future, are utilized by Athena to save the day (reminiscent of another glimpse-into- the-future-save-the-day moment in the sci-fi dramedy, ""Galaxy Quest"") as well as Athena's self-sacrifice in blowing up the big power source (check I, Robot for another nice cutting-off-the-power-at the-source implosion).

Once the evil Nix is dispatched, it's time for director Brad Bird's ""Kumbaya"" moment. New Athena-like robots are sent to earth to give a gaggle of cool recruits (most probably culled from the ranks of young UNICEF workers) those cool lapel pins so they can catch a glimpse of the good things to come at ""Tomorrowland.""

Now that the UN has taken over ""Tomorrowland,"" singing ""We are the World,"" we'll all be quite comforted to know that all is right with Walt Disney, Sleeping Beauty, his Seven Dwarfs and theme rides at Disney theme parks worldwide.",1432425600,9,4962,4.867298578199052
7127344,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"This movie is the 1987 Ishtar merged with the 1982 Tron with a touch of the 1998 Enemy of the State thrown in.  An ongoing stream of consciousness looking for a plot.  Probably has some terrific special effects but they get lost in the ongoing complaints of the characters.  Ouch!, save your money.",1432425600,8,298,4.584905660377358
7127345,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"There are two things that indirectly influenced my decision to see Tomorrowland. The first is my burgeoning interest in films, media, books, and various information resources related to the idea of heaven, utopia etc. (from spiritual and points of view pertaining to the afterlife). Additionally, I was also influenced to consider seeing the movie when I recently looked up some information on the Greyhound bus website and came across an ad for the Tomorrowland movie. Minimizing movie spoilers, the movie centers around residing in a parallel world/dimension that is indirectly created out of the collective consciousness of some of the most open-minded and gifted men and women of living today.  A couple of good points to this film; The main players of the film are working harmoniously and persuasively together that gives the impression that they at least got along during the creation of the movie.  For instance, George Clooney and Hugh Laurie interact with their roles in a way that give the impression that maybe they spoke of the representation of Tomorrowland before acting out their scenes (there is an event in the film where both men are seen discussing how the collective viewpoints of society may or may not have an influence on the chances of creating a better world). Then there are the children and younger adults shown in the movie striving to collaborate together on seeing what can be done to preserve the existence of Tomorrowland. There are even guest appearances of certain celebrities during the movie. My only caveat is that the film could have featured more scenes in Tomorrowland. Either way Tomorrowland is great for those who are open to seeing Utopian themed films and/or fantasy movies.",1432339200,5,1720,5.074204946996466
7127346,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"In consecutive week-ends, two films have been released dealing with a future dystopian world.  Last week, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is resurrected by George Miller and company.  And this week Disney and Brad Bird give us a PG version of a possible future.  Both films suggest that if we Earth-folk don't change our ways we will be on the verge of distinction.  The similarities pretty much end there however.

""Tomorrowland"" features Britt Robertson (""The Longest Ride"") as Casey Newton, a high school genius and the daughter of a NASA engineer (Tim McGraw).  He's about to be furloughed as the local launching pad is about to be shut down.  Casey does what she can to prevent the closure including minor acts of sabotage, which in this film is worth a slap on the hand.  Unbeknownst to her, Casey is slipped a small round pin by a young girl named Athena (excellent Raffey Cassidy).  When Casey touches the pin, she is instantly transported to world well into the future, but planted physically in the same location.  Confused?  You'll catch on quickly.  Did I mention the film is PG?

There is also a flashback sequence involving a young boy, about Athena's age named Frank (Thomas Robinson).  Frank gets his pin while attending the World's Fair in New York in 1964 and makes the trip to the future before being exiled back to the present when he's about 20.  He grows up mean and cantankerous and living alone in a remote broken down house.  At least he looks like George Clooney.

Athena rescues Casey from the clutches of a pair of sci-fi collectors played by Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key and takes her to Frank's house.  It appears they both have been chosen as possible saviors of the planet.  The film certainly has its heart in the right place but then goes about hitting you in the head with its version of the future.  The scene where the future-world's Governor Nix (Hugh Laurie) might have been written by Al Gore.  Don't get me wrong, I believe most of what he and the writers are saying, but I'm afraid many future deniers won't.

While the film delivers its message heavy handedly at times, the message is valid.  And then there is no denying the interesting look of the film.  It reminds me of those scenes from ""Blade Runner"" with the tall buildings, flying vehicles, large colorful billboards.  Only replace the dank, smog infested congestion with blue skies, gleaming buildings and just slightly less congestion.  The film has its share of action sequences as well.  Nothing too nefarious of course.  Did I mention this movie is PG rated?  Overall, a long (kiddies won't like that), fun ride with a serious message.  Recommended.",1432339200,6,2651,4.75
7127347,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"In the beginning I was thinking ""this is great; why so many mixed reviews ?"" The movie is imaginative and fascinating. However then it gets more and more preachy about how dreamers ""like Walt Disney for example"" can save our dying world. Which is a good lesson but a little too hammered into the skull with long winded conversations between George Clooney and Hugh Laurie.
  Sure it's nice to get a summer movie that tries to educate. The whole dreamers can save the world lesson is a good one. It's just that there's too much dialogue about it all that almost put me to sleep. While a fight in a comic store where StarWars toys are used as weapons should have been funner. All the smiling bad robots were more goofy than they were intimidating or cool as well. They also reminded me of the imposter Inspector Gadget robot in that awful movie.
  The effects are nice as are the visuals and Britt Robertson (Under the Dome) carries a lot of the movie herself. Robertson has a future and a great movie in her. I just wish Tomorrowland was that movie since it had the potential to be better than it was.",1432339200,6,1100,4.430693069306931
7127348,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"""Tomorrowland"" (2015 release; 130 min.) brings the story of Frank Walker and Casey Newton. As the movie opens, we see young Frank heading to the New York World's Fair 1964 to present his invention (a jet pack). While he gets the runaround, a young girl named Athena convinces him to follow her, which turns out to be to Tomorrowland. We jump forward to the present and are introduced to Casey, a high school girl who is bottled up with great ideas on how to make the world a better place to live. Unbeknownst to her, Athena slips a pin in her belongings, which turns out to be the connection to Tomorrowland, much to Casey's delight. Alas, the pin's battery runs out and Casey is returned to earth. At this point we are maybe 15-20 min. into the movie. What is the connection between Frank and Casey? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from director Brad Bird (The Incredibles,  Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol, among others). This must have been right up his alley after MI, as Tomorrowland is every as epic in scope as MI, and then some. Second, this turns out to be an all-out adventure movie that aims for both the young (this is rated PG) and the young-at-heart, and from all I can tell, more than succeeds. Third, the movie's influences are many but some of the more obvious ones are ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (Casey's optimism, belief and ability to be amazed mirror those of Richard Dreyffus) and yes, ""The Wizard of Oz"" (the journey to a promised better future). Fourth, the production of this film is just outstanding. Tomorrowland (the place) is eye-candy from start to finish. And the special effects are impressive but do not overtake the movie or the story. Fifth, as to the acting performances, please note that but for a short scene in the opening, George Clooney (playing today's Frank) doesn't actually enter the action until the start of the second hour of the movie. For me, the movie's linchpin turns out to be little Athea (played by UK newcomer Raffey Cassidy). Last, but not least, there is a pleasant orchestral score, composed by Michael Giacchino (Oscar winner for the ""Up"" movie score).

The movie opened nationwide today (not counting the Thursday evening sneak previews). I had seen the trailer but really didn't know what to expect. I have not seen or been on the Disney ride from which this movie borrows the title and hence I have no idea how close to the ride, or even the concept of the ride, really is. I'm guessing not very much. What I can tell you is this: I was very surprised how entertaining and great this movie turned out to be. An old fashioned adventure movie with a sci-fi twist. If I had young kids, I would absolutely take them to see this. While the early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not well attended (somewhat to my surprise), the audience was mostly moms with young kids, and from the crowd's reaction, the kids LOVED the movie. There are so many 'blockbuster movies' out there competing for our attention, I'm hoping this one doesn't fall between the cracks. ""Tomorrowland"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1432252800,141,3229,4.659649122807018

7127389,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Tomorrowland, Disneys 2015 homage to retro-futurism, is like a tree made from grafts of several different species. The core story is a quest to find hope for the future in a present beset with troubles. Branching from this trunk are sub-plots: a mystery-adventure, a buddy movie, and a light romance. The effect is beautiful, but somehow the pieces don't quite fit together.
The story revolves around three heroes out to save not only the eponymous Tomorrowland but the future of our own world as well. George Clooney is Frank Walker, an optimistic boy-genius inventor turned cynical middle-aged man. Britt Robertson is Casey Newton, a twenty-first-century version of Frank Walker. She sets the story in motion when she receives a mysterious ring that temporarily transports her to a futuristic utopia, Tomorrowland. Guiding Casey on her quest is Athena, played by Raffey Cassidy. Athena is a robot . . . pardon me, an audio-animatronic. . . who looks like a ten-year-old girl. She was Frank Walkers original guide to Tomorrowland back in 1964, and she comes to Caseys rescue in the present day. The three join force in a last-ditch attempt to breach the dimensional walls of Tomorrowland and head off a global catastrophe.
This is not a movie of excess, but one with an abundance of everything: appealing characters, thrilling action, stunning visuals. One gets the feeling that the filmmakers tried to put as many of their great ideas into the film as they could and ended up with too much. Tomorrowland could easily have been, and perhaps should have been, three movies, the first following Franks discovery of and exile from Tomorrowland, the second Caseys quest and Franks redemption, and the third the struggle to save both worlds.
Thats why Tomorrowland doesnt quite work. Any of the three leading characters could have carried the movie on their own, but instead Tomorrowland tries to weave their stories together with mixed results. The movie starts with Frank Walkers story, but before it can get moving it jumps fifty-some years into the future to pick up Caseys story.
Athena, because shes a robot, does not change in fifty years, so her character is meant to tie the others together. She does so until Casey finds Frank. The story then takes up their story and Athena is left with little to do until the movies climax. What she was doing on Earth for fifty years, and how she escaped the robot enforcers from Tomorrowland, is never mentioned.
The attempt to pack everything into one film cannot be excused by inexperience. Brad Bird, co-writer and director of Tomorrowland, has demonstrated his considerable talent on hit films like The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol. Its possible that Tomorrowland is like Spielbergs 1941, proof that even a great filmmaker can  have an off day. Its also possible that this is a case of too many cooks. With an estimated budget of $170 million, not to mention the obvious tie-in to Disneyland, studio executives would have a hard time keeping their opinions to themselves.
For all that, Tomorrowland is a lot of fun. The movie is more like a visit to its namesake at Disneyland, with monorails and impossible architecture and a focus on The Future. Its hopeful message also comes through, that we can still have a bright tomorrow if were willing to put in the work today.",1520640000,,3369,4.950530035335689

7127402,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Tomorrowland in southern Californias Disneyland has gone through many premutations over the years and after a time it rarely felt as if it was keeping up with that world of tomorrow; while tremendously fun it had a sense of still being behind the times as if you were stepping back into the future and then looking back toward the supposed future from that previous time.  So too does the film Tomorrowland often have the same feel.  Perhaps its star George Clooney as a crotchety older inventor who helps to place this feel (Clooney plays Frank Walker, an inventor who helped to create the intended utopia of Tomorrowland)?  Or perhaps its the circa 1960s adult fantasy of an imagined utopian future society that was realized for a time but only succumbed to ideological frictions?  Whatever the reason Tomorrowland is not the normal Disney fare aimed at young kids.  It is often times intense and can even be a little edge-of-your-seat frightening such as when Clooneys Walker must save he and new but brilliant young nuisance child Casey (played by Britt Robertson, whom I kept thinking was actress Chloe Grace Moretz) from a pack of homicidal humanoid automatons.  Tomorrowland also takes some of its scientific concepts seriously and while it doesnt go into any length to really discuss them they may also lose younger viewers.  This movie is best for the teen and up crowd; adults can certainly enjoy the adventure.  But I fear that the film, excepting a few sequences, is overall a forgettable experience and one that may be lost to many imagined mix-ups with different films that contain similar scenes.  And I think that viewers who go back to view it again (and again) will have an ever-growing experience that this futuristic film feels like it was made further and further in the past.  Me?  I don't mind the past.  It can take me on a trip back to the future and leave me with a feeling of whimsy, just like Disneylands Tomorrowland.",1518912000,3,1946,4.793413173652695
7127403,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"I think the biggest problem with this film was that an idea was put together and clichd as it mostly was, the piece gained momentum and held my interest for the first half. I feel the problem that ensued was the inability to decide where the story should go from there. The main characters in the beginning were played by two wonderful actors, Raffey Cassidy and Britt Robertson. I think they had good chemistry and were an enjoyable team, if only they had a better story to be a part of all the way to the schmaltzy ending. For me the film went utterly downhill once George Clooney was added as a main character. Even his introductory speech at the beginning was performed with his typical smugness which was just irritating, but the female sidekick off camera kept me interested with her charm and wit. I don't understand why Hollywood loves this guy, he really is mediocre at best in everything he does. He just never seems to be on point, but always too emotional or just cardboard unbelievable. I find it amusing that two young actresses kicked him to the curb easily with their talent, which suited me just fine! Hugh Laurie also mailed in his performance, and I feel was not the best choice for the villain. He just never seemed sinister or gave me a sense of foreboding disaster. I'm giving this 2/5 only because of the effort displayed by the two young ladies. The CGI was amazing as usual, but I think what is destroying my enjoyment of most movies these days is the lack of ideas surrounding the imagery. You need more than greenscreens and handsome actors to engage the audience.",1518912000,,1591,4.566433566433567

""Remember the Future."" - movie tagline

Four WHIRLWIND Stars. The SciFi-fantasy, CGI-heavy Disney film, Tomorrowland (Plus Bonus Features), is a film full of spectacular visuals and chases. The early part of the film focuses on the scientific exploits of young Frank but quickly moves over to an equally-talented teenage girl, Casey, who quickly is caught up in a dilemma that sets off a determined search. As more characters appear, the storyline takes on a breathless quality, as action-sequences and fight scenes rush pell-mell past the viewer. The movie plot is actually simple but presented in a convoluted, time-altered fashion that keeps the viewer guessing until the climax and the denouement. The fast-tempo action is mesmerizing but so much so that it tends to dull both the senses and the surprises after a while. Even so, it is a well-made, well-acted action flick pushed along by a great music score. The 3-hour time is composed of 2-hours of movie and 1-hour of special features. Starring George Clooney, Hugh Laurie, Britt Robertson, Raffey Cassidy, Tim McGraw, Kathryn Hahn, Keegan-Michael Key, Thomas Robinson, and more. Kid actors Robertson, Cassidy, and Robinson do their own daring wired stunts. Directed by Brad Bird. Director of Photography is Claudio Miranda. Music by Michael Giacchino. And do watch the superb animations with the credits at the end. Very Definitely Recommended. Four ACTION-PACKED Stars.
(Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Rated PG. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray. Movie running time is 2:10:01. Bonus features are also well-worth the watch. Total time-3 hours and 4 minutes.)",1517875200,,1613,5.30078125

7127432,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Brad Bird, Tomorrowland is a sci-fi/adventure starring Britt Robertson as a smart, positive teen teeming with scientific interest and George Clooney as a former kid-genius now disillusioned. In order to prevent the end of the world, they team-up with a curious girl (Raffey Cassidy) on a mission to return to ""Tomorrowland,"" a futuristic world on a parallel plane.  Hugh Laurie plays the political leader in Tomorrowland.

This is a Disney production that cost a whopping $190 million with another $140 million tacked on for marketing. While it brought in a respectable $209.2 million worldwide ($93.4 million in North America), it was considered a disappointment due to its high cost.

Tomorrowland is a fun, compelling fable or a fairy tale about what happened to our positive outlook of the future and how can we get it back. To be expected by the presence of a teen and a girl as the protagonists, the target audience seems to be pubescents and adolescents, but theres just as much for adults to enjoy with Clooney and Laurie, not to mention elements of Star Trek (the future, androids, robots, etc.) and the Terminator films (ditto). There are several thrilling action sequences with the unexpected one in the shop being my favorite.

The opening is a little convoluted and the action sequence with the boy, his jet-pack and the robots in Tomorrowland takes you out of the realm of quasi-realism and into cartoonish fantasy. This turned me off and I was tempted to tune out but, thankfully, the tone quickly turned more reasonable and the story perked up with the focus on Casey (Robertson) and Athena (the girl). The ending, while drawn out, conveys a positive message.

THE MOVIE RUNS 130 minutes and was shot in Enderby, Vancouver & Surrey, British Columbia. WRITERS: Damon Lindelof & Brad Bird.

7127439,1,B00WAJ8RBI,"Some spoilers.

This is a concept film with a tiny cast and almost no story. Half of its a chase film and half of it is a ""place the bomb"" film. The solution to every problem is to shoot something or blow something up plus several carjackings for good measure.

The story is basically a variation on Atlas Shrugged. A bunch of scientists have created a technology utopia outside the world and have turned their back on the world. They keep the Ayn Rand idea about the isolated invitation-only community of genius, but the writers see the point of the community as being to influence and/or save the world from the outside rather than exist for its own sake.

The film had a budget of $190 million dollars, but its tough to get a sense of where all that money went. The cast is tiny. There is one long extended effects scene. But other than that, they didn't much for their money. Like a 1980s action cartoon, there are lots of deaths, but the deaths are all robots so its ""ok"". That is rather ironic considering that one of the plot points is how ""human"" one of the robots is supposed to be.

Clooney is totally unconvincing as a ""scientist"". He basically presents his bland likable stock character. Hugh Laurie phones in an utterly forgettable performance. He doesn't say much. He doesn't do much. And it seems like he didn't really care.

There is a strong ""science is magic"" theme to the whole thing. That you can do anything if you dream hard enough, are provided with the necessary resources and are a one of the ""good"" people. Laws of physics, costs and hard work are just what doubters do. The message is more from the perspective of people who want to make movies than it is from anything else.

There is a outright awful metaphor about ""feeding wolves"" that they use. The problem is that wolves are not fed. The wolf kills and consume the easiest prey around them. Its another irony that society has generally come to empathize and identify with predators.

Toward the end, the film offers up its modern understanding of what genius is. Its not about being an intellectual or a scientist or an engineer. Its not about hard work or accomplishing something.. Genius is: Playing an electric guitar in the street, its about working at Tesla, its about protecting elephants in Africa, its about planting trees in your neighborhood, its doing chalk art on sidewalks, its about being a teacher, its about being a technician working on a wind farm. its about being a dancer, Genius is equal to virtue in the film's eyes. There are always plenty of nerds or big robots to do that science stuff, but that electric guitar street musician is a priceless dreamer.

The film turns the original concept of ""Tomorrowland"" at the world's fair on its head. Rather than being, as it was, a dream or a vision for a better world shared by all, the film makes it an invitation-only real experience for the few of virtue. Its also rather sad that film that wants to be optimistic amounts to little more than a chase film full of killing where blowing something up with a bomb is the solution to everyone's problems.",1509321600,2,3101,4.574774774774775

I liked the message that the movie conveyed to our youth to keep a positive attitude about the future of humanity and to not allow the negative issues that we see in our current events to make them cynical about getting involved in making the world a better place for all.

A lot of nods to Disney mystique of a bygone era, which I love, since that was the era of ""good"" Disney, not the unbridled greedheads who run the company now. And which overshadows everythng the company does. This probably could have been a much better movie if the PC crowd at Disney had not gotten ahold of it and made the standard liberal changes. The male lead character in the original story had to be changed to a girl (a girl hero now required in all Hollywood movies) and overall message about how we don't stand for anything anymore, don't shoot for the stars anymore, was largely replaced with the standard liberal crapola about DIVERSITY! and their beloved climate change agenda. Still, it's worth a look. A visually stunning view of the future...an amazing view of EPCOT as it was originally envisioned by Walt.",1490659200,,1064,4.751351351351351

7127494,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"First released nearly two years ago now, Disney's Tomorrowland was a film that seemed to slip under the radar. That was despite a  cast including George Clooney and Hugh Laurie, Brad Bird (who also directed The Incredibles) as director, and a intriguing marketing campaign. Available now on disc and streaming, it's a film you ought to be watching. Why?

Its certainly got it's share of good performances. Though Clooney has top billing, the real star of the film is Britt Roberston as the young and optimistic Casey. Living in times that stand in stark contrast to her world view, she becomes the soul of the film with everything literally revolving around her. Robertson wonderfully portrays both a sense of awe and also believability as she is thrust into a world which can be as threatening as it is awe inspiring.

Contrasting with her is Clooney as Frank Walker. The film opens with Walker as a boy genius at the 1964 World's Fair (played by the delightful Thomas Robinson) and it is through him that we're introduced to the titular Tomorrowland. From there we, and Casey, find him as a reclusive and cynical adult who she forces to confront his past, and possibly our future. Clooney, who has always seemed to be a bit out of time anyways, is perfect casting for the role, and his world weariness makes for a wonderful contrast to Robertson's Casey. Watching the interactions between the two of them is one of the film's many highlights.

That's not to undersell the rest of the cast. There's Laurie in a role that's hard to easily define but which he fits perfectly, despite his limited amount of screen time which largely comes in the film's last act. Looking like a throwback to live action Disney protagonists of the 1950s and 60s is Raffey Cassidy as Athena, though the role she plays is quite different to any of those characters. The cast also includes Tim McGraw and Pierce Gagnon as Casey's family, Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key as a pair of interesting characters, plus sci-fi fans might spot Stargate franchise actors Paul McGillion, David Nykl and Garry Chalk in small roles. Together they form a nice ensemble that populates the film and surrounds its lead actors.

The highlights of Tomorrowland might be in its production values. The production design and costumes range from a wonderful recreation of the 1964 World's Fair (and a couple of Disney related attractions there), to the near future, before giving us glimpses of Tomorrowland itself. The results are a wonderful mixing of past with present, retro views of the future with a world quite similar to the one we live in now. In terms of design, Tomorrowland itself is a feast for fans of the genre with its wonderful use of everything from jet packs to 1950s rockets. Adding to that atmosphere is the score from composer Michael Giacchino which musically encapsulates what the film does visually while also properly underscoring events unfolding onscreen. The results are a feast for the viewer's eyes and ears.

Tomorrowland is also something that seems increasingly rare: a film you could sit down and watch with the entire family. While it features plenty of action sequences, there's no real gunplay or gore. The film also proves that one can do an effective science fiction/action film without resorting to dropping foul language in every other piece of dialogue. The results are oddly refreshing to say the least, especially as Tomorrowland counteracts its sometimes dark themes with just the right amount of well timed humor. All of which is important because of what the underlying message of the film is.

More than anything, Tomorrowland is a film about optimism and hope. It's safe to say we live in cynical (if not outright depressing) times where it seems that everything around us is out to kill us and that the world is going to hell. Tomorrowland calls back with nostalgia to a time when that wasn't the case and, using Clooney's Frank Walker character, and shows us how we made the journey from optimistic futurism to the dystopian-fearing world we live in. Yet, through Robertson's Casey, the film shows that maybe we can recover that hope and start moving forward again. It's a message that seems to be working its way into popular media in recent times, including both the galaxy spanning epic Interstellar and the time altering antics of X-Men: Days Of Future Past , yet perhaps Tomorrowland expresses that message better than either of those films. It may wallow in that sentiment but it's better for doing so.

In the final analysis, though it didn't quite find the audience it deserved in cinemas, one hopes that the disc and streaming releases will it do so. From its performances, strong visuals and stirring score, it calls back to the future that might have been while also addressing the world that we live in now full of excitement and thrills. It's a tale of optimism and hope with a message we ought to be embracing.",1490140800,2,4934,4.837677725118484

7127507,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"There was a time not so very long ago when Americans faced the future with confidence and optimism.
We looked to the heavens and wanted to go there.
We welcomed people to our shores and didn't talk about building walls to keep them out.
In those halcyon days we didn't fear science.
Something changed, however. Many people will blame the 9/11 terrorist attacks for that but the truth is its roots go deeper. In the early 70s we started to become more insular, more anxious. Among the signs that this is so: Veterans who had fought for our country in a misguided and unpopular war wound up sleeping on the streets in increasing numbers because they were demonized by those who never served. People began complaining about paying taxes to support what had once been an excellent public school system.
We began looking inward, not outward.
It wasn't long before we began looking to the heavens not with wonder but with trepidation and a nagging fear about meteors and comets that could wipe out every living thing on the planet.
Director Brad Bird misses those earlier days and said one of the reasons he made ""Tomorrowland"" was because he wanted to recapture that spirit of optimism that was once so prevalent in America.
He succeeded, in my opinion.
Brilliantly.
The story is fairly complex for a science fiction movie aimed, primarily, at younger audiences. It begins in 1964 when a young boy goes to the New York World's Fair lugging a jet pack that he invented but which doesn't actually work. He is transported to Tomorrowland after meeting a young girl, played by Raffey Cassidy, but eventually leaves that fabled land. The story flashes forward to the present day where a young woman - the daughter of a NASA engineer - is doing her best to stop the American space program from being completely dismantled - both literally and figuratively. She, like the young boy so many years before, also finds herself magically transported to Tomorrowland, which exists in another dimension. Back in her own dimension she longs to return to Tomorrowland and winds up meeting the older, cynical version of the young boy who had once gone to the World's Fair with such optimism. It takes some convincing - and an attack by some murderous androids -  but eventually the man and young woman set out for Tomorrowland with the help of Cassidy's character.
The cast is excellent and features George Clooney, Hugh Laurie and Britt Robertson in addition to Cassidy. Laurie's character delivers a wonderful monologue toward the end of the movie that, I thought, perfectly summed up the film's intent.
The cinematography is top notch and the special effects are excellent but not overwhelming. This is a movie that focuses on the story and the characters, not on the CGI, and that is a major plus in my opinion.
A wonderful movie, full of hope, with plenty of action and a strong message: ""Tomorrowland"" is easily worth 5 stars.",1486771200,3,2910,4.796812749003984

There's a lot of cynicism and pessimism concerning the future going around these days, and a lot of people seem to enjoy, even find entertaining, zombies and dystopias left and right. Instead, here is a movie with lots of optimism that says it's okay to be a dreamer and to not give up. Sure, the movie is not perfect; there are a number of things that could have been done differently and better. But I don't choose movies because I think they will be classics or are stunning examples of cinema technique. I don't even choose movies to see because reviewers rate them highly. Reviewers are too often dead wrong. I choose movies because they intrigue me. And this one certainly did that. It is delightfully entertaining.
The acting is great. George Clooney is great as a cynical, disillusioned and grumpy middle aged man. Britt Robertson is excellent as an optimistic and scientifically brilliant teen, Hugh Laurie comes across convincingly as a determined villain. And what can I say about Raffey Cassidy?

Synopsis: Bound by a shared destiny, a bright, optimistic teen bursting with scientific curiosity and a former boy-genius inventor jaded by disillusionment embark on a danger-filled mission to unearth the secrets of an enigmatic place somewhere in time and space that exists in their collective memory as ""Tomorrowland.""
Starring: George Clooney, Britt Robertson, Hugh Laurie
Director: Brad Bird

As I said, this isn't that bad of a movie. People just need to give it a chance. Let me get the good parts of the movie out of the way. George Clooney. With exception to one movie (and I think everyone knows what movie that is) Clooney hasn't made a bad movie. This is no different. Bringing Disneys interactive city to life finally was a dream come true for a lot of people. Of course, they had to add in some things that took over said city, but that didn't hurt the movie.

Brad Bird is a hell of a director. He actually directed my favorite MI movie. In truth, he was the right person for the job. All he really had to do was take the story and make it a reality. He did just that. I absolutely loved the story except for one thing.

Right about now, you're probably wondering what it is that hurt the movie for me. Well, lets see, as much as I loved Clooney in this movie his age became a factor real quick in the movie. It turns out that he was playing a man almost twenty years older than him. Yes, there other people who could have fit the age bracket a lot better, but I can forgive it. What I cant forgive is the fact that most of the damn movie takes place in the real world instead of Tomorrowland. It is the one thing that hurt the movie more than anything.

Hugh Laurie as the villain was decent. He was just Hugh Laurie still. Do kind of wish that Keegan-Michael Key was in the movie more, but thats okay. He served his purpose in the short while he was in it. Hilarious to bout.

If you have a spare couple of hours, you can give this movie a gander. For nostalgia, I would buy this movie, but I don't think it is good enough outside of a rental.

If, however, you are an optimist or, even better, someone who agrees with the notion that a better future is in our grasp and that we are responsible for making it so, this movie is both a call to arms and a damned fun time. Does the movie have its faults? Yes, George Clooney is, again, George Clooney. Pacing could be a bit better. But the performances of the two young women Britt Robertson as the heroine and Raffey Cassidy are wonderful. High Laurie as the ""villain"" reprises a bit of his House character, but it fits the story and message of the film perfectly. the visuals are beautiful and the *spirit* of the bright tomorrow shines through this movie, a bit corny at times but, nevertheless a very real, very inspiring quantity.",1482192000,3,866,4.522292993630574

Wanted to turn it off after 15 minutes and should have not wasted my time.  Over rated George Clooney flick as usual.  What a disappointment.  Enjoy the trailer.  It's better than the movie.  The plot is not there. There is no story line and jumps all over the place looking for a direction.  And you will be very disappointed that you wasted not only your time, but your $ for sure.

The richness and quality of production as well as the vibrant cast and overall message are simply top rate.  I really enjoy this movie.  At the end of my last viewing I was tearing up, (good, vibrant, hope-filled tears) as the final scene unfolded... (no that's not a spoiler, I didn't tell you what the scene was)  I started to give 4 stars because I rarely give 5...but then realized, I'd have to come back and give the other one anyway... so, FIVE ain't no jive!  This is a keeper...  I enjoyed all the cast, each for their own performances.  Special kudos again to Mr. Clooney because we continue to enjoy his wide range of work.  We were blown away by his work in Oh Brother... and have paid more attention to his work ever since.  OK, you got the idea... it's really good!",1481932800,6,939,4.369942196531792

7127671,1,B00WAJ8RBI,"The start and end are suppose to be congruent and yet they are not. In the first scene he is talking into a video/recording device and in the lady he is talking to children robots.

They never explain why and how only the person the pin is given to an utilize it.

I'm one of the last scenes they create this intimate scene that intones that the child robot (theoretically older than Clooney) loved him back and for a second it crossed my mind that in any other movie a scene like this would have an intimate kiss following. This thought made the scene extremely uncomfortable and awkward. Reminiscent of the movie Beautiful Girls. I didn't expect this from Disney.  Not all the violence. It all seemed a bit over the top and excessive really and for no good reason except to appease audiences; not to augment to the storyline really.

Lastly...
They explain that at one one people could go back and forth between worlds and yet we are to believe that none of the futuristic technology and ideas never made it over.  I found it trite and a movie for non-thinkers. Disney dumbifies another movie. (Yes I know that's not a word).

There are some bravura set pieces of action, most notably the escape from the farmhouse of Frank Walker (George Clooney) that has been surrounded by merciless adversaries. Britt Robertson is a class act, playing the role of the optimistic Casey Newton, whose positive outlook on life turns out to be a key factor in saving the human race from Armageddon. The movie is really stolen by Raffey Cassidy, a fantastic young British actress, who plays a crucial role in connecting Casey to Frank. The ending struck me as too easy, given the dire straits that the human race has created for itself and our planet, laid out in convincing fashion in the film. But, this is about the power of optimism, so maybe I shouldn't be so pessimistic.",1478476800,2,892,4.7612903225806456

This film takes the ideals, dreams, and American ingenuity during the period when Walt Disney flooded the 1964 World's Fair with an optimistic view of the future and considers how we might defeat the pessimism of today's society by empowering today's dreamers to spread their optimistic outlook around the world. Brit Robertson's character represents the inspired youth while Clooney's character represents the disenchanted generation that needs ""saving"". Hugh Laurie plays and excellent antagonist that represents the cynicism and  pessimism that has infected today's society. Early in the movie there are several nostalgic ""nods"" to fans of Disney and his rides born out of the '64 World's Fair, and in Tomorrowland itself you'll spot Walt Disney World's ""Space Mountain""!

7127743,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Very entertaining, and unique. It was not predictable like many films these days, so it kept my attention. The acting was great. The only negative was that it seemed like some of the story, or backstory was missing. One of the most important jobs of the director, I think, is choosing what to edit out of the final script and footage. They need to keep it trim to keep the pacing and keep people's attention. However, if they cut too much, the viewers have trouble following the story, because they don't have all the background info for the story, the characters' motivations and decisions, etc. I think that was the case with this film. My family and I found ourselves saying, ""Wait, what's going on? Who is this new character, - and why did he/she just do that?""
I think they maybe intended the story to unfold for us the way it does for the main character, but instead it was just confusing at times - like they tried to pack too much story in too short a film. I feel like there must be a book this was based on, and I want to read it now.
Nevertheless, it was really very good, and I loved all the actors, and the sets. Very well done, especially the special effects! Definitely worth watching.

7127792,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"This looked like a promising film and just like director / producer / writer Brad Bird I had often asked myself the same question: What happened to our positive outlook of the future?

Unfortunately, neither does the film over its 2+ hours run explore the reasons nor does it provide a satisfying theory. Ultimately we learn it's because of a device (!) that further drives us into apathy, run by a mad scientist (David Nix - ""Nix"" is German slang for ""nothing"") who had hoped the device would produce the opposite effect, having learned that another device constructed by Frank Walker foretold the end of the world (but is obviously unreliable!), and who rather wants to run ""Tomorrowland"" as a ghosttown than to recruit and save the best and brilliant minds of Earth to give mankind a second chance on another planet - instead his army of robots kills innocent people on Earth - D'oh!

Several ideas that made it into the film and the visuals of the utopia that is Tomorrowland and the road trip that this film essentially is are great to watch and experience. Produced in Dolby Vision HDR the Blu-ray features great and beautiful images. While the Bonus Features are interesting they do not really help to better understand the world behind the film - apparently you have to read the prequel novel: http://overmental.com/content/tomorrowland-explained-exploring-the-world-of-the-future-20873 (almost feels like The Force Awakens)

While the film starts off with nice trip down memory lane (1964 New York World's Fair) it later diminishes another world fair (Exposition Universelle 1889) by seriously suggesting that a faster-than-lightspeed rocketship launch base had been built under the Eiffel Tower by the philanthropic organization Plus Ultra.

This segment almost has the character of repentance, considering the people in charge of Disneyland Paris closed down Le Visionarium -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timekeeper - in 2004 to have it replaced with the action ride ""Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast"". Put simply: An edutainment film promoting progress by learning and education and conveying a positive outlook of the future (that was Walt Disney's ""signature"") was replaced by Disney's people with an (may I say mindless?) adventure ride which ultimately makes Tomorrowland quite a bit ambivalent - as the film itself rather seems to contribute to the essential problem its premise is about.",1473033600,,2405,5.318421052631579

7127802,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"Tomorrowland Review

In the movie Tomorrowland, the theme of world problems is brought to the surface which throughout the course of the movie, finds solutions to these issues. Some of the world issues consist of world hunger, obesity, religious feud, and global warming. These issues directly relate to real-world problems that we deal with on a daily basis in life. For example, nearly 11% of the worlds population is undernourished and many Americans and a  potential president for the country believe that Muslims should not be allowed in the United States.  This movie was produced in May of 2015, in the past decade all of these issues have been discussed and solutions have been thrown around. The movie creates a satire kind of atmosphere when Tomorrowland talks about the world ending and how it would be avoidable but people have turned it into entertainment and haven't done anything about it, which is mostly because they thought it not possible. The movie gives a beneficial portrayal to the public by alerting them to world issues and offering solutions such as turning to a younger generation for answers. The movie also touches on the theme of entertainment, and how it relates to our networked world which is the main thing that people today turn to find happiness. This theme, as well as the theme of denial, shows how people ignore the end of the world and only value it for the entertainment.",1472774400,,1412,4.875

Nothing is held to any logical order, and scientific words are thrown around with the intention of making the characters and the movie seem smart.  If you know what some of the words mean, the effect is the opposite.  In the end, the good robot tells them to use the evil machine to save the world from a disaster that will destroy the world within 58 days.  Glimpses of the disaster make it look like a combination of nuclear war and global warming.  The good characters send out more robots to recruit typical liberal children's-movie heroes:  artists, ballet dancers,  street musicians, wind farm operators, and scientists (all of the last group are female and/or black).; ""dreamers,"" the good robot calls them.  The main characters use the formerly evil machine to force everyone in the world to think the positive thoughts of these ""dreamers,"" and the whole world becomes liberal and saves itself from a disaster that would have destroyed it within 58 days, but apparently it doesn't.

The final scene seems to have been shot on the set of the Wizard of Oz, where they are running across the field of poppies to get to the Emerald City.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

Partly because I'm a huge fan of the Tomorrowland area of Disneyland and partly because it's just a fun movie. If I had to guess why it didn't do well at the box office I would guess that it was partly cynicism and partly because this kind of movie just isn't made anymore. This is a true Disney movie like Escape from Witch Mountain and others. I watched it again just recently and enjoyed it more the second go.,1464652800,,527,4.227722772277228

I'm not famous for my positive view of the human race, but I'm also disturbed by the trend toward utterly hopeless views of the future. One Library Thing question not long ago was: ""Read any good Dystopias' lately?"" Tomorrowland is beautifully and imaginatively filmed and acted. It's fast and fun to watch. It doesn't offer (as it so easily could have) easy solutions for a better future, but it suggests that we might make it if we try. The young female leads are excellent and for my money, this is George Clooney's best work since Up in the Air. We couldn't understand Tomorrowland's 50% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Then I looked at the reviews here on Amazon and I saw negative comments about Fabian Socialism (are you kidding me) and negative reactions to the multi-racial recipients of the Tommorowland badges at the end of the film. It's the same old cant from the same old conservatives who've given us a choice between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump to lead us into the future.

 repercussions. The opposite really! It does show negative consequence for destruction of private property. However, I think a child would get the message ""bravery may require me to lie, sneak out on my own, trust my life with an adult I don't know..."" Not really good ideas in our day!

7128148,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"When I saw the trailers, it looked like a wacky chaotic movie with overtures to Disneyland, ET and Doctor Who.  I passed on the theatrical release, but did give it a go on disc.  The opening moments showed unexpected promise--witty, interesting, clever--at least for the first few minutes anyway--my hope were up!  An excellent cast, excellent sets, but a script that truly STINKS--verbosity to the extreme!!  Before getting to that, clearly this was made for children, and the children in some of us older folk--but, there were some extremely violent scenes that had no business being there, from police officers snuffed out, to store owners being blown up, and a young girl run over by a car--I found these scenes unforgivable in a movie oriented toward children.  And, the script, another one of those time travelling jaunts that forgets front from back, past from future, and then spends seemingly hours of disturbing dialogue trying to come to grips with what to do and how to make sense of things.  Too much talking, not enough continuity, not much too root for or even feel good about.  A truly wasted opportunity.",1462233600,2,1121,4.8994708994708995

7128159,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"This is a good movie that I dearly wish could have been greater than it was.  It's extremely high-concept and although well-directed and produced - it's a flawed movie in execution - in fact it's because it reaches so high, the flaws are pretty obvious.

Best way I can say it is - this movie is like a day at a Disney park.  Once you get through the entrance it becomes one ride after another and sooner or later they all seem the same. The script is about as subtle as a sledgehammer on canvas - I wish they had baked it for another six months and pushed up the characters some more.  Also the product placements and Disney self-promotion become rather obvious.

Don't get me wrong, I love this movie - it's take on that optimistic world of tomorrow promised to us yet never come to pass -  it pulls on your heartstrings in such a profound way.  Clooney, Laurie, and young Raffey Cassidy MAKE this film - its worth getting for those performances alone - but the smiling evil robots coupled with the incessant need to make every fourth scene over-the-top with action really becomes a negative.

Several characters and events in the movie have no explanation or motivation.  There is a ""bad guy"" in the movie, but it's never clear to me in a satisfying way what he's trying to do or why - is he truly evil, or just confused?  That goes for another major character in the movie.  I came away with a bit of a confused 'why did that happen?' feeling after the movie, despite the nicely optimistic ending.

7128202,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"Alright, this movies is one of the few I've ever bought on Blu-Ray and that's saying something. First off, this is not an amazing movie with a great plot and complicated characters. This is a simple movie with a simple premise that pretty much anyone can understand. I thought the cast did a great job of conveying a sense of realism. The effects are incredibly well done and at no point are they overdone to the point where you feel like something like shown in the movie would not be possible.

Why did I like the movie enough to give it 5 stars? I love space, tech, and the future. I like what the movie stand for and what it bring to light. There's a scene in here about the world's fair which I thought was great and shows how everyone used to think about the future but we no longer do. As a civilization we have stopped looking up and we just look at our phones to see what plans we have this week. If we cared more about space, I am sure Nasa would have a larger budget and we would have done much more by now. This movie isn't about space travel but it's just worth mentioning that space travel would push humanity forward more than sailing the ocean did hundreds of years ago. This movie has optimists and pessimists, it shows how differently people can view a circumstance. The movie serves as a reminder that we shouldn't stop innovating and that everyone can be part of creating a better future if you don't give up on your hopes and dreams. Want to be an astronaut? Do it. Want to be an engineer? Do it.

I can see why some people might not like it but not why some people are giving 1-2 stars. If you have not yet seen it then I recommend watching it with the above mindset. It will make you feel like a kid again if you just sit back and don't try to compare it to something like Interstellar.

7128237,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"Obviously some spoilers ahead. The basic premise of this movie is terribly flawed, and unfortunately that ruins the whole thing. If you have a cake that tastes terrible it doesn't matter how much frosting you put on there, and that's what you have here.

The future people have built a device (it's never explained why or what it was meant to be for or anything like that) that shows the word is going to end. The movie claims that just that device existing and saying the world will end is what's causing the end of the world because it's broadcasting the end. Except the entire time they're on Earth literally nobody knows about the end of the world. The people this machine is supposed to be broadcasting to aren't even slightly aware of the broadcast.

Since people aren't aware of the broadcast, obviously it doesn't matter whats on the broadcast. So the machine showing the end of the world can't be doing anything because nobody has seen it.

The only thing this movie offers are those cliche feel good moments every movie has. ""I thought you didn't love me but you really do at the end!""  ""I thought I was a regular person but now I know I'm special!""",1460764800,,1159,4.5311004784688995

7128240,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"Men and boys cause problems.  Girls have to fix the problems to save the future.

What a lousy movie.  Disneyland's ""Tomorrowland"" is about embracing the optimism that science and technology can and will bring to our planet.  But this nut case of a film says that Tomorrowland is in an alternate dimension, AND that it's the human males who have caused all the problems in the world, and who will continue to do so.

Ergo, it's up to some teenage girl to solve things.

Huh?  Did I miss something here?  What about that miniaturization ride at Disneyland?  What about the ""Blast off to Mars"" ""ride""/theatre where the ride simulates a trip to Mars?  What about the robots who talk about the history of the nation?  What about Space Mountain for gods' sake?

But no, Tomorrowland is about some pathetic social architects teenage girl fantasy of how ""girls rule the world"" or should, to put it in popular music vernacular.  Forget all the modern inventions that males have given us, because it's the girl that's going to solve problems (regardless of the fact that men have also fought one another to resolve said same problems).

It's a huge Disney visual spectacular, but the theme, story, and even the plot are pretty thin to begin with.  It's professional looking enough (could you expect any less from Disney), but in spite of all that, it's a horrible film.

7128242,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"A recommended good movie by Disney that is geared to the younger audience yet played well with me (as a 60+ aged
male). I fail to see why it did not make more money. For those who remember, Tomorrowland reminded me of the
Hardy Boy episodes of the Mickey Mouse Club (late 1950s?) where they ultimately find the gold doubloons. The special effects are superb and the story line easy to follow.
Noticeable weaknesses include the following scenes:
1. Why are the fireman killed by those from a future where greed, corruption, etc., supposedly do not exist. A stun
ray would have been appropriate. The scene stunned me to see that Disney writers lost track of their wholesome image.
It was like seeing a smiling Mickey Mouse kill a fireman for no reason. Hmmmm.
2. A couple of references are made to lying. Hmm. Guess that has not been ""fixed"" in the future either.
3. We are whisked into a later Tomorrowland scene where there is obvious degradation in the city and the lack of
people. Why? The meaning is later described in one of the deleted scenes. But even then it was not clear. I think it should have been included nevertheless. It reminded me of ""Open Range"" movie where the deleted scene on how one of Costner's cowboys was killed. One wondered in the movie how it all happened. Other deleted scenes were correctly omitted from the final cut.
4. I missed the meaning of the conclusion. Ending was muddy and did not resonate with me. Could kids leave a theatre wondering what really happened?
George Clooney is shown with his beard stubble addressing the ""kids"" at the beginning and end of the movie. It may be
the in thing today where women drool over George with his 5 o'clock shadow. When I saw the father with a clean shaven
face in his Disney clean Tomorrowland uniform in the same scene there just seemed to be a disconnect with George.",1460246400,,1846,4.563253012048193

7128247,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"I really loved the movie and I don't say that often.
The movie was good but no 3D.... Minot gonna curse but want too.
The reason 3D movies sell slow is the usual double the price of dvd.
Yes I think they are worth it. But I'm on a fixed income (hurt on the job) and must pick frugally.
Tomorrow's I would have paid the $29 to $35 cost.
Having  47"" and 65"" 3D tv's, I wait anxiously for the next one.
3D movies I will watch 3 and 4 times.
A blue ray 1x and then when it's on cable.
Cable btw offers squat for 3D movies.
Nothing good.
No John Carter of Mars, no Transformers, no I Robot, no Journey to the Center of the Earth (Brendan Fraiser is it?) Which I all own in 3D.
Being disabled with a back injury (on the ambulance) I can't sit 2 hrs or it hurts bad.
So. No Imax for me (no golfing, no scuba, no motorcycles.... which I miss).
So I buy a 3D movie and watch it at home on my 65"" 3d with 7.2 surround in the living room or on my 47"" 3d tv with my older 5.1 surround in my bedroom.
Even the glitchy 3d movies I love em.
When will Red box rent 3d movies?
I will pay $5 to rent a 3d movie from them. Even if Red box had only 15 3d rental boxes in the state of Connecticut I would go to one or ask a friend.
I AM REALLY DISSAPOINTED I CANT BUY A COPY OF TOMORROWLAND IN 3D. Guess I will have to watch the old style movie for free on cable.

Ths director is a star director. He made films like <Mission Impossible:Ghost Protocol><Ratatouille><The Incredibles>amd <Iron Giants>.
And he did it again. Unfortunately boxoffice wise, this movie didn't appealed so well but I think it was just a pure luck.
The story was so so unique and imaginative from the beginning till the end. I haven't felt this kind of feeling from the SCi-Fi movie for a long long time. Of cours from the recent Star wars too.
The commercial tries to make the audience think that the main actor is George Cloooney but acually the main actor is Britt Robertson, one of my very best actress in nowadays. It is here second major film in Hollywood. The other one is <The Longest Ride>
Mosely she was in the small movies like <The First Time><Ask Me Anyting><White Rabbit> and so on.
She has this strange charm that I cannot avoid. She is a bit childish but on the other hand se feels like the oldest sister. She is not supeer pretty but her smile is making me happy to look. And plus she looks way younger then her age.
In this movie she acts a teenager but acutally she is 26.
In the movie <The Longest Ride> she was in her age.
In this movie, there's time travel, location travel and so many other exciting things going on.
The Robot people are also very exciting to watch especially the girl is really charming. She is the one who felt in love with George Clooney wen he was a boy and now George is old but she still loves him.
All and all, you should judget his movie by the boxoffice score. This is the moive that should have been a bluckbuster back in 2015.

It takes our belief in the future, our faith in ourselves, a desire to trust and befriend each other, to feel our love.  It may indeed be hard to find ""recruits"" for these ideas in today's world, especially with our bizarre politics and bombs going off at airports.  Yet this film seems more cogent and more needed today than it was when it emerged in 2015.  The writing, the acting, the imagination are all excellent here.  This movie is under-appreciated maybe because people think it is old-fashioned to have hope,  or that it is somehow naive to reimagine a future more positive than the one we seem to be headed for at full gallop.

7128292,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Kind of a George Clooney fan, here. Not an ""ER"" George Clooney fan, but more of an older George Clooney - movie fan.  Clooney isn't particularly versatile. He plays pretty much the same kind of character in every movie, just in a different situation. He's not a bad actor, just not a lot of range. And, that's ok.  I don't really watch movies because of the actor, I watch because of the movie. But, I've enjoyed Clooney in many of the movies I've seen.  I honestly went into this movie not aware that it was a bit of a political undercurrent. The entire time watching, it was obvious Tomorrowland would rile up the conservative base of the U.S. and as I read through other reviews, it did just that.
Tomorrowland touches on much of the negative social issues that are plaguing the world right now.  The message throughout all of the movie is to promote innovation and change to work to create other options to change the negative, despite those that want to prevent change.
I liked the effects. Nothing too ridiculous or redundant.  It's slightly violent, but not enough that would scare too much. The PG rating is pretty spot on. No outrageous language. No sex or nudity. No drugs or alcohol.  The self destruction of one of the main characters might be a bit disturbing for younger kids. The movie doesn't dwell on this and immediately goes back into promoting hope.
I've seen a few people complain about the end scenes with children ranging in age from about middle school through high school being talked to by Clooney about promoting change for the future.  I find that funny since that is exactly what happens in school. There's is absolutely nothing wrong with encouraging young minds to want to grow. For all the negative we have in this world. the opportunity to learn, grow and make a difference is wide open. There's nothing wrong with encouraging that in people of any age.",1458432000,,1886,4.645645645645645

The trailers made the movie look visually appealing, just not enough that I could be bothered to watch it until now. Sadly, I suspect that plenty of other people felt the same way and an altogether high quality movie went largely unnoticed and ignored.
The performances by both George Clooney and Hugh Laurie are by no means the best of their careers, but both men are good enough to insure that there isn't much chance of a poor performance. It's Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy who really pull off the excellent performances for their roles in Tomorrowland, being both believable and authentic on the screen.
As much as I love dystopian fiction in both literature and movies, it is so refreshing to see something optimistic and hopeful where the future is concerned...much like Walt Disney himself was. Sure, the premise of the movie is the struggle to fight against the same sort of negative future we see in most near-future science fiction...but that negative future isn't the focus of the movie, it's the goal of overcoming it that we get to enjoy. The writing definitely could have been better, but the only way to improve it would have been to extend the movie beyond its already longer than two-hour runtime. In all honesty, this story would have been better suited to a mini-series rather than a feature length movie...it would have afforded the necessary time to build the story more evenly and correct for some serious problems with pacing.
It's a sad statement about the world we live in that I suspect the lack of popularity had more to do with there being a preachy tone regarding the rampant anti-science and anti-intellectual perspective adopted by altogether too many Americans than with the poorly paced writing (that really wasn't as bad as it could have been). It's a shame, because this really was a surprisingly good movie with an uplifting message to it...but too many people these days are fixated on rolling around in muck and relishing being stupid to the point that it's some sort of badge of honor that they aren't educated or informed.
There's something truly meta about Tomorrowland hitting the audience in the face with their own stupidity, but in the movie at least that entrenched glorification of blissful ignorance can be overcome by turning off a machine. I wish it was so easy in real life.
I think more people should watch this movie, especially children...it's a sweet and uplifting story that's predicated on the world being a better place if we actually embrace the better aspects of our nature and the things that make us human.",1457222400,,2921,4.891129032258065

(Mild spoilers here)

The first couple of minutes has stars Britt Robertson and George Clooney doing this insufferable back-and-forth, that totally kills any hope that this might be what we were all hoping it to be from the trailers. It promises lots of cool adventures and amazing sci-fi action, but all it delivers is a mess of plot holes and a pathetic hero. By the time our heroine (Robertson) catches up to Frank Walker (Clooney), he's a miserable shut-in that still holds a grudge 50 years later for being kicked out of Tomorrowland. Strangely enough, he's also obsessed with a pre-pubescent girl robot.

I wish I had saved the money purchasing this blue-ray to buy something useful.. like toilet paper even.  I think next time I'll Redbox a movie before putting out the cash to decide if it's a keeper!

The movie should have begun with the boy going to the world's fair, which was an interesting and promising start. But, what  followed was a disappointing, confusing and disjointed story line that put me to sleep.  George Clooney, a good actor, who normally portrays a strong lead, was miscast and not believable as Frank,  the lead male character.  This role required a nerdy science geek, man-child comedic actor type who we could laugh with as well as at, like Steve Carell or Ben Stiller. Britt Robertson, the leading actress who played the teenager Casey, should not have been written to ask so many obvious questions. She was described as a genius, so one would naturally expect her to enjoy the challenge of figuring things out.  And, instead of reacting with fear and disgust when introduced to new ideas and or substances, would have embraced those new experiences, observing them with curiosity and behaving with more rationale and logic rather than overly emotional.  Ellen Page whose only a few years older, may have been more convincing in this role. Additionally, some of the inventions and special effects were contrived and the transitions weren't seamless from scene to scene losing me and making me the viewer, not as invested, but the final half hour came together and was action packed.  Plus, the concept and setup was good. Overall, though, this middle and meat of this movie was messy and all over the place. As well, I think had the little robot girl been revamped into an adult via upgrades over the years, as most computers are, it would have been a more interesting choice.

Tomorrowland is about the future that has been stolen from us by those who sell us war and engineer disaster.

I don't know why, but I thought the movie was going to be similar in storytelling such as Saving Mr. Banks. Besides, Tomorrow Land is also a Disney movie.

Being a parent usually either makes you Disney repulsed or obsessed, and I decided a long time ago to just embrace it and run with it.  I think my love of movies makes that easier to do.  With that said, Tomorrowland was one of the films from last year that interested me the most.  I have to weigh these kids movies right, because Im bound to see a slew of them over the course of the year and I want to pick the right ones to invest my time and money into, and Tomorrowland just seemed like a no-brainer.

Disney; check.  Interesting premise; check.  Charismatic star; check.  Nostalgic ode to the Disney of yesteryear; check.

Sadly, those checks couldn't make this movie work.

Tomorrowland is pretty much the epitome of all build up and no pay off.  It has a really engaging and provoking premise wrapped up in a beautifully composed, and at time visually captivating package that just completely drops the ball at the finale and produces something that feels lazy, rushed and uninspired.

But its not all bad.

Tomorrowland boasts a rather exciting and compelling first half that is anchored by a riveting star turn by young Raffey Cassidy (no, Britt Robertson is not riveting) who plays Athena, an ageless robot child who has a personal stake in the journey ahead.  As Athena, Cassidy imbues her with enough honest frustrations and convictions to keep us fully invested, even when the storyline is failing us or Clooneys odd pining over her (yes, he pines) is uncomfortable to watch.  The actual journey from suburbia to the world of Tomorrowland, complete with a stop off in Paris, is well plotted and paced, but once we arrive at the magical world of the future, I find myself wanting more, and not more of what they gave me.

The way the films plot is wrapped up is an embarrassment, to be honest.  It basically gives up entirely, allowing the films build-up to feel almost pointless.  Unfortunately, the world of Tomorrowland itself is kind of a letdown, feeling far less exciting and vibrant as expected.  In fact, the actual Tomorrowland at Disney World is a more impressive visual spectacle.

At the end of the day, the kids liked thisbut they haven't once asked to see it again, and I understand why.  It promises something it cant deliver, and once the credits role the film leaves you with nothing to ponder, nothing to wonder and nothing to care about.",1454803200,2,2488,4.617312072892939

It's a Disney movie so everybody obviously thinks it's going to be for kids, but they want to try to reach the adult sci-fi audience. In an attempt to reach both, they never completely grasp either demographic. The actors are great the special effects are for the most part well  done, though at times, a little childish. The biggest problem is that the script doesn't really grab the audience because it can't grab people when it really doesn't know who its trying to grab.

An adorable little girl robot gets hit by a speeding truck.  To keep things current, there's even a robot beheading.  Yippee.

Now I'm old enough to have been to the '64 worlds fair so none of this scared me much.  But assuming its for kids or kids and their families, what were they thinking?

The ""teaser"" trailers we got offered ""nothing"" about what this film was about. Nevertheless, I have faith in Brad Bird as a filmmaker, and went in hoping for the best. I was not disappointed in the least. Tomorrowland is great. If you love science fiction, or better yet, retro science fiction, you'll love this. Tomorrowland surprised me at almost every turn, and after having finally seen it, I'm shocked it did so poorly at the box office. I think had people known what kind of film it was, or what it was supposed to be about, and pushed the adventure angle a little more, it would have done really well. It's also a great film to watch with the family; there's a little something for everybody in this. It's such a shame this will ultimately be a sour note on Brad Bird's stellar film career, because in reality, it's a pretty great sci-fi/family/adventure film.",1452816000,,994,4.621468926553672

7128486,1,B00WAJ8RBI,"This is a disappointing effort from the director of one of Pixar's finest feats; the Incredibles.  A confused little film that is hard to adequately dissect because it is, even more, difficult to categorize.  If this was to be a Science Fiction flick, it lacks the substance and seriousness to quantify it as such.  If it was supposed to be a family-friendly fantasy, some of the surprising violence and overall confusing message and morality, earn it a well deserved to fail.  Finally, if the goal was to create a melodrama, it just doesn't possess the script or performances to provide the quality to do so.  So, what is it?  Your guess is as good as mine.  The only definitive is that it is a poorly acted, written, and developed piece that tries to be pro-environment but ends up vilifying the very same proverb it works to craft.

7128514,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"Dystopian movies that predict or are set in a future that is dangerous and bleak, filled with hopelessness are common.  Blade Runner, the Mad Max, and Terminator movies are all good examples, some well done, and enjoyed by many, including at times myself.  Tomorrowland stands in marked contrast to these movies, with the prospect of the destruction of civilization very present in the movie, yet approached quite differently.

The movie starts with a narration by Frank Walker (George Clooney) and Casey Newton (Britt Robertson).  A long flashback sequence involves a young Frank Walker at the 1964 Worlds Fair in Queens, NYC, in which he tries to get a prize for inventing an almost working jet pack.  The judge, David Nix (later known as Governor Nix, played by Hugh Laurie), is dismissal of Frank.  However, a young associate of Nix named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) meets with Frank, and gives him a Tomorrowland pin, and tells him to follow her and Nix into the Its a Small World ride.  The ride ends up transporting all of them to another dimension where the futuristic city of Tomorrowland exists.

The above sequence ends with little details on the fate of Frank, and picks up shortly thereafter in the present with a teenaged Casey Newton covertly entering a NASA launch area to sabotage cranes that were going to tear it down the next day.  The next day her father, Eddie Newton (Tim McGraw), a NASA engineer, remarks that he heard of the cranes malfunctioning, but new ones are due to be flown in, and that following the launch areas destruction he will lose his job.  In high school that day each of Caseys classes involve teachers predicting the doom for our civilization for various reasons, with Casey objecting that they should instead focus on finding a way to avoid that fate.  That night she attempts to sabotage the cranes again, is caught, and also ends up being given a Tomorrowland pin, which gives her a stunningly realistic view of Tomorrowland.

The rest of the movie follows Casey as she seeks to discover what Tomorrowland is and how to get there, meets both Athena and Frank (who is now middle aged), and faces dangerous adversaries.  It involves some really nicely done action sequences, human form robots (as you can see in the trailer of the movie), and a fair amount of humor.  There is a strong dose of optimism, largely voiced by Casey, that the world can be changed for the better, regardless of how hopeless things appear.

All of the actors playing the main characters, Clooney, Robertson, Cassidy, and Laurie, do a good job with their roles.  However, the standout is Raffey Cassidy, a teenaged actor who does an amazing job of bringing the unusual character of Athena to life with a mix of smooth humor and at times pathos that is nicely done.  Some have criticized the evident crush that an older Frank Walker has on this young character, but in the context of the movie (this is science fiction after all), it really does make sense, and the relationship itself is as platonic and chaste as you want.

Some critics have said that this movie has pacing issues and while filled with great ideas does not follow through as well as it could.  In contrast I found the pacing was generally not bad at all, with the excitement of the story giving a nice sense of movement as the story unfolds.  In fact one or two of the extended scenes, available on the Blu-ray release, could have likely been left in without harming the pace.  My one criticism in this area is the part of the movie following the climax, which perhaps could have been handled better.

For parents who might be concerned about their children watching this movie, I can say that I watched it with my 12 year old daughter and had no issues with it.  Younger children however could potentially be frightened by some occasional violence that while bloodless might still be upsetting to the very young.  I do not recall any foul language or humor, and there is no nudity or sexual content at all, as expected with a Disney movie of this type.

Overall I found this a fun and satisfying movie to watch, and expect to come back to it often in the future!",1451520000,4,4147,4.671251719394773

I couldn't believe that Brad Bird -- who directed one of my all time favorite movies (The Incredibles) -- directed this stinker.

Couldn't believe George Clooney of Syriana stood for all of that unnecessary expository dialogue.

A movie is supposed to move along, not get bogged down in a swampy morass of platitudes that never end!

By the time the movie is over, you're ready for a silent film from Charlie Chaplin!

7128545,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"Enjoyable and fast moving, with a pair of engaging heroines and the always reliable Clooney, this movie nevertheless suffers from an inability to decide what it is. Quasi-comedy? Action thriller? Sci-fi spectacular? Preachfest? It also does not have the confidence to let its plot unfold as a mystery. Instead, we are treated to a long prologue set in the Clooney character's childhood, so that we know what's up before we are actually introduced to the story proper. This prologue is framed by an annoying, plodding narration by Clooney shot in closeup, as he is constantly interrupted by an offscreen voice. This sunny opening and subsequent introduction to Casey, the main character, in modern times has a children's movie quality to it. Then, suddenly, the film erupts in violence - the murder of three police officers - that turns the movie into a violent action chase. The movie veers again towards the end, into James Bond-style villainy, before ending on an allegedly hopeful note. Leavened in is some preaching about global warming and the general unsavoriness of common mortals. I enjoyed it, despite the tone shifts and preaching, thanks to the performances by the three leads, especially Raffey Cassidy, the fast pace, and great visual effects.",1451001600,,1256,5.131707317073171

What is this ""machine"" that is telling humanity to accept that the world will come to an end?  It sounds like another one of a thousand indirect approaches of an atheist cult such as Hollywood to point fingers at religion,  etc... Yet economical sustainability depends more on people accepting that they don't deserve mansions in Beverly Hills, no matter how famous, or how much people are willing to spend on them.  As for now,  I couldn't afford to pay builders to build me a very humble home that can accommodate many people, because I'm competing with people who pay them a lot, to build massive homes for few people.  George Clooney and every major employee taking part of these films is guilty. Saving people from an apocalypse has a lot more to do with how we utilize each others time,  and what we give of ourselves to keep our world sustainable, than it has to do with believing that the warning devices such as prophecy are the real dirty culprits.

7128585,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"If you are looking for something that goes beyond the standard format Disney/Hollywood fairytale for your kids, Tomorrowland is it. The reason why I liked this movie, apart from the very beautiful computer animated scenery and architecture, is because it has the imaginative power to look beyond the apocalyptic scenarios currently being produced by Hollywood. Tomorrowland is also remarkably free of violence. Although it still follows Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey faithfully, it does so with a little more aplomb and appeal to imagination than Star Wars. I have one criticism, applicable more to adult viewers that children: it is that the movie generalises the cause of our current, impending ecocidal doom to a lack of human imagination and will. In this respect, it foregoes any mention of the ruthless neoliberalism at the core of our apocalyptic expectations. The movie's message is therefore that we can avert our forthcoming doom, simply through better technology. I don't believe this is true: we need systemic change as well. But that is hardly a subject that one can impose on young viewers. Ultimately, we are left with the question whether this movie is a satisfactory conduit for inspiration and it is. Well done Disney!

It was insane in its core, promoting a tried and failed classic ""overthrow religion and your parents and create your own order,"" captured like a page out of some socialist book on how to educate young to hate their parents. The gist was captured clearest in an eloquent George Clooney speech at the very end, but the entire movie had been leading towards that: ""Its not hard to tear down a big evil building telling people that the world is going to end, but it is hard to figure out what to build in its place.""  Yes, directed entirely toward children. Nauseating, and sadly most people haven't a clue that it is truly destructive..",1449532800,21,675,4.6722689075630255

go to Bad Panda Shop in Hong Kong. Yup,I'm sorry to say that China gets these movies in 3-D but Americans are only offered the ""crummy stardard""version. I wish I didn't buy this because I keep wishing I was seeing the 3-D version because the effects are so cool. I used to buy lot's of
Disney Blu-ray's but since they have stoped releasing 3-D to the U.S.A. I buy about 10% of what I used to on Disney home video. Also having to go to China and spend more getting Disney 3-D movies NOT AVAILABLE IN THE U.S.A.: I stopped gong to Disney Parks and stores! I must say that
Disneyland & Tomorrowland are products of the U.S.A.For Disney to release 3-D Bluray for China and NOT for America is something I will never understand.

The plot is not unraveled until you are fully engaged but that is where the story starts to fall off. There are engaging visuals and exciting parts but the theme is clich and completely unoriginal.

Anyway, the biggest letdown was how capable the lead female character was supposed to be - though the only real time we see that is when she fixes something her dad was working on. Big chance missed to keep girls interested in STEM by giving them a bit of a hero whose character kind of falls somewhere more in the two dimensional category.",1449100800,,609,4.545454545454546

The youngsters (Robertson and Cassidy) definitely outshine the vets (Clooney and Laurie).  In a way this is a love story but it's one that's about the journey a lot more than the destination.

It looked like it would be a good kids movie, but I was wrong. I don't find foul language to add anything to the quality of a movie and it doesn't reduce the negative impact by having the words trail off as the person is driving off, etc. If someone hears ""Son of a..."" their mind will fill in the blank - and I don't want to waste my imagination on filling in the blanks.

And I even thought the mediocre reviews would be biased because I found the trailer to be entertaining.
Unfortunately, after renting and watching, I think the majority of the poor reviews are, in my opinion, fair.
The ideas behind the story are clever and interesting - plus having Hugh Laurie and George Clooney in the cast were another couple of reasons to watch.
But, when it was over, I was disappointed because the story line wasn't developed or as rounded as it could be, and the characters were very one-dimensional.
I realize this isn't meant to be a 'deep and meaningful' film, but I would have liked to have felt more empathy with the characters once the film was over.
Disappointing.",1448668800,,788,4.556338028169014
7128754,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Although writer-director, Brad Bird, made a flawless transition from animated gems like Ratatouille to the powerhouse, Mission Impossible:  Ghost Protocol, this one-- Tomorrowland, is a rough ride.

Tomorrowland's plot is messy, the story line feels haphazard, actors (like George Clooney and Hugh Laurie), though stellar craftsmen, feel miscast and out of sync in the film.

There are strong performances from the beautiful Britt Robertson-- who carries the film with ease, and a haunting, phenomenal turn from Raffey Cassidy as a 12 year-old robot.  This bot, by the way, is no ordinary pile of metal.  She's a wiz with weaponry, exercises mad martial arts skills on the bad guys, and tugs at your heartstrings when she walks the line between real and robot.

Tomorrowland definitely sports highlights.  The place itself, Tomorrowland central-- a bright, bustling city-- is the stuff of heaven.  Britt's character gets to explore the futuristic city freely, dashing through sleek-looking crowds of pedestrians, gazing at young space cadets, and hopping on a hover train as she pleases.  But, the joy is short-lived as this view into the future city lasts a mere 2 minutes.

From here, the film gets messy.  Though the movie starts with George Clooney as a boy in 1964, we soon lose track of him and it's onto Britt's rebellious teen-angst story line.  Then, it's a bit jumbled with Tomorrowland pins that seem inexplicable, a visit to the world's scariest UFO antique store, fighting robots, escape bathtub pods (don't ask), an Eiffel Tower spaceship (don't ask), and the list goes on.

The most disappointing aspect of this whole film?  Tomorrowland is a location in the film that rarely materializes.  It's shown just briefly in the film and 95% of the story takes place on regular, old Earth.  So, why make a movie about Tomorrowland, if no one is going to visit the place?  Feels like a waste of time.",1448668800,2,1907,5.022292993630574
7128755,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"Its very sad to think that the critics and children in adult bodies poo-pooed this movie. George Clooney is an amazing human being - I would like to meet him one day.

Having been to the 1964 Worlds Fair I got a little weepy seeing the CGI recreation in the opening scenes. I would recommend this movie for children above 10 and any adults who remember the frustrations of childhood and find themselves being a little too cynical lately. The Blu-Ray transfer and sound are superb, better than what I remember from the theater. This movie needs more people to see what they have missed.

From his perspective, it was very enjoyable, and although the adults in his life enjoyed the movie, we had a few questions about aspects of the story  that were portrayed rather poorly. Also, the adults saw similarities between this movie and both the Terminator and Tranformers series. Overall, it was a fun movie to enjoy for our family night - I don't recall any cursing or blood, and there's no sexual overtones. The 8-year-old watched it again the next day, so he'd rate this movie 4 Stars, but as an adult, I rate it 3 Stars.",1448323200,,583,4.605769230769231

7128812,1,B00WAJ8RBI,"Tomorrowland is an incredibly sad effort and such a disappointment from Brad Bird and George Clooney.  If someone took a pile of overwrought 60's vintage Disney visualizations of the future and a pile of sci-fi plot elements and loaded them into a musket, then shot them at a movie screen, you'd have Tomorrowland.  Britt Robertson plays Casey Newton, a sort of hacktivist prodigy along the lines of the young John Conner in T2.  Unfortunately her character is irritating to the point that the viewer is indifferent to whether she succeeds or gets reduced to a cloud of tachyons. This movie has zero heart and fails to compel viewers to be excited about anything beyond wishing for the end.  If I could only have seen my future tachyon self buying the movie, I would've realized that my money would've been better spent on a box of Dots and my time better spent re-watching an episode of Rick&Morty or Archer.",1448323200,10,909,4.734177215189874

Is ok for a children movie. Maybe. Maybe we should tell our kids ""Hey, tomorrowland would be great, if there were no terrorists killing people at every latitude, if profit wasn't the force moving the world and so 99% of your creativity is actually gonna be lost into fulfilling the stupidity of the majority of baboons of the planet, if people was more interested in loving each other than to what happens in between Miley Cyrus..."".

Entertaining film that begins about a young boy, Frank, who is given a ""pin"" that takes him to a different world. The movie progresses in years and becomes about a teenage girl, Casey, who is given a ""pin"" which she finds among her belongings after she is arrested for trespassing on NASA property where she was causing destruction to the cranes which were disassembling the launch pad. By touching the ""pin"" she is transferred to other world - Tomorrowland. As Casey searches for answers to what the ""pin"" is the adventure leads her to meet up with a young girl, Athena, the same young girl who gave a ""pin"" to the boy, Frank, at the beginning of the movie and who has given the ""pin"" to Casey. Athena has not aged in all the years that have past, as it turns out she is not human, she is a robot. Casey and Athena eventually find the home of a man who turns out to be Frank, the boy from the beginning of the movie. Frank is older now and reluctantly helps Casey and Athena find a way to Tomorrowland  - where they discover what has happened to the once amazing world which does not look as it once did. The story, directing, acting are good though nothing that stands out. Overall the visuals and/or effects are very good to excellent. The movie is entertaining throughout though the ending felt like a ""were looking for some really down to earth but extremely smart and talented people to lead our future"" progressive public service message.

7128918,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"I love science fiction and normally Disney movies are usually pretty good.  This one was about Tomorrowland, a place situated in another dimension of Earth where all the geniuss and dreamers live to create without distraction.  They recruit new residents with a small coin/chip that when you touch, it transports you over to Tomorrowland and gives you a glimpse of the society.

Now without giving spoilers, this film delves into the possibility of different dimensions existing in the same space as now, as well as time travel backward and forward.  I also found it very very interesting it also went into the philosophy and to me, natural Law of Attraction.  When the two players, Frank (George Clooney) and Casey (Hugh Laurie) get into Tomorrowland, they are shown a device powered by Tachyons which can view time forward or backward.  They are shown an apocolyptic future where life as we know it is destroyed, within 50 days.  The kicker is time and events are not set in stone.  Because after viewing this future, Casey makes up her mind to fix it.  Just then, a blink of a future where none of the detonation happens flashes before their eyes.  The lesson, you have complete control of  your now and your future, based on your attitude and decisions you make.",1447891200,,1266,4.788018433179723

excellent  especially the young female star.  But the  story takes some concentration to figure out what is happening.  I had to watch it again to
catch what was happening.  I may be wrong, but I don't think this one did well in the theaters.  But for those who like to think out these kinds of
stories this one will do just fine.  I was totally lost during the first half but finally figured it out.  I won't say what the plot is, but this story reminds me
the type of sci fi stories that come out of Britain.  Maybe Americans don't like to think anymore; just give them sex and a lot of violence and they
will be happy.  The more I thought about this film, the more I liked it.  For those with IQs over 50 (are there many?) they may enjoy it.  I don't like
George Clooney but he was good here. And I generally don't like the Liberal Disney way, but I like this and several other recent releases which
bring back some good family entertainment.  This movie is a bit involved but extremely well done, with some very worth while special effects to
see.  I do recommend this.  FOUR STARS Plus for this film.  I got my DVD from Amazon; I did not see this in a theater.  Enjoy!",1447718400,2,1312,4.192771084337349

Too many surprisingly-violent-for-Disney chase/fight scenes, not enough narrative, and not nearly enough heart. The central message -- of lighting a candle instead of cursing the darkness (or worse yet burying one's head in the sands of self indulgence) -- deserved a better story and more relatable characters in which to frame it. In the end it was just too conventional. All-white cast saviors the day. The revolution is led by the privileged. Black and brown folks only appear for the kumbaya finale. How much more awesome a story and movie it would have been if all of those conventions had been turned on their ear.",1447718400,,750,4.8671875

For those who claim there's too much violence, please. I've seen more violence watching cartoons. It's action packed, which will draw a younger crowd, and hopefully they will recognize the truth and message in this film.

7128988,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"Typical the kids are tomorrow fair.  Your pre-teen kids will love it.  As an adult it was light and shinny though most entirely fluff, no real substance in terms of character or plot.  Bad guys doing bad things.  Kids are smarter than adults.  Kids save the day, or at least inspires the adults to do it ""for the children"".  Nothing wrong with that.

Now the bad.  Race and gender stereo types.  White men bad, everyone else good.  Don't believe me.  Who are the two main adult male characters?  Franks and David.  Frank the boy wonder who was creating wonderful things, but ended up creating the thing that will destroy the world, and David the non-specific power broker in Tomorrowland who is trying to destroy Earth because it sucks and doesn't want to let icky non-white people into Tomorrowland where they might be safe..

Both white, older, and male.  Both literally at fault for all the worlds ills.  Frank for making the machine and David for using it.  Turns out the machine makes people do bad things.  What?  People are not responsible for their own actions?  It's all the fault of their technocratic inter-dimensional corporate overlords.

Seems that being male and white is not wanted or needed in the future.  Frankly Hollywood, being white and male and a bit older, I am sick to death of being painted the bad guy for two reasons.  The first I am not at fault for everything in the world, and two if you want my help then don't sit back and spend all your time spouting off how I am the bad guy.  There is nothing wrong with the protagonist being white and male especially when it drives the plot, but when the character is the protagonist because he is old, white, and male that is well wrong.  Sure maybe it's a little pay back for the bad guys always being Black, or Arab, brown, or what ever, but last time I checked we were supposed to be beyond that.  Why keep rubbing salt into an old wound, other than to keep it festering?

Some will say I'm being paranoid and overly sensitive, but then we see all the shiny new recruiters, robots that look like children, that inexplicably explode when damaged, being sent out to recruit new ""dreamers"" to help build a better future, and would you look at that not one white male face in the bunch.  We have a smattering of races and colors and for some odd reason the bulk were women, because more women are in college?  I also guess in addition to women's study graduates, ballerinas and street performers can do Engineering because those are exactly the people you need for a space program or a cure for cancer or just simply getting a toilet installed or the lights to stay on or anything else of substance.

7129025,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"It's really sad that in this day and age the only movies that are really guaranteed to be a box office success are basically superhero movies or an already established franchise like Jurassic World or Star Wars. You have a successful filmmaker in Brad Bird (Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, The Incredibles) with an original, yet classic idea based loosely off of the retro-futuristic section of the Disney park with the same name. An A-List actor (if he's still considered as such) with George Clooney, some young up and comers and a few recognizable faces all backed by writer Damon Lindelof (Lost, Star Trek Into Darkness) and a $190 million budget, so what could go wrong?

For starters the movie lost almost $100 million domestically, at that point the film is officially considered a financial failure. Why did it fail? So many of the pieces seemed like they were primed to make it the blockbuster hit of the Summer. The movie felt refreshing, it seems so very rare that we are treated to a genre film that is suitable for families and that is exactly what Tomorrowland is. It is a 6-7+ kids and adults family film that evokes ambition of an earlier Spielberg masterwork. The effects are fantastic, the movie is almost a nonstop adventure and practically any kid could relate to wanting to pursue a career of space exploration.

At the end of the day the movie may have been 10-15 minutes long, which didn't help when it ended up falling into a clich monologuing scene about how humans are destroying the earth (something that has recently become a Disney staple). All that to say, it was still an entertaining film, with original ideas but will probably never get the appreciation it deserves.",1447113600,2,1703,4.789115646258503

It was a unique movie and a great way to remind kids to never give up on their dreams and no idea or dream is dumb or ever to small to stop you from your goal in life.

7129049,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"I say bless the optimists of the world for where would we be without them? Probably stuck watching Swedish movies all the live-long day. Teenager Casey Newton, she's an optimist who- no, wait, just bend an ear to the below exchange of dialogue. It'll tell you everything you need to know about Casey:

- Years ago, her parents, star-gazing: ""What if you get all the way up there and there's nothing?""
- A very young Casey Newton: ""What if there's eeeeeverything?""

See? Optimist. She's never without her red cap stitched up with the NASA logo. And yet Casey inhabits a world on the cusp of environmental entropy, a world over which looms the shadow of globally complicit extinction, the wolves of dystopia baying at the door. Our world. If only there were a place that could harness dreamers like Casey...

TOMORROWLAND was one of my most anticipated films of 2015, and it lived up to my lofty expectations, or 90% of it. It started so good and stayed so good for so very long. Up until the third act, TOMORROWLAND was a perfect motion picture, and, me, I just soaked in the grand mystery, the characters, most of whom seem to harbor great hidden things about them, the clean and bright spectacle of 1950s-style retro-science. There is the New York World's Fair, 1964. And an invaluable lesson about two wolves. There is a pin. There is a countdown to doomsday. There is a jetpack.

There's Brad Bird with his stirring stick. Bird was born to direct movies redolent with senses of awe and wonder and sheer escapism. TOMORROWLAND recalls the best of Spielberg's stuff. It's such a unique and creative and wonderfully visual experience. The acting is across-the-board exceptional, with Clooney and Britt Robertson (as ""Casey"") anchoring the film like it's old hat and no worries. In fact, until Clooney shows up, Robertson capably shoulders the narrative. Having said that, the breakout star is Raffey Cassidy who plays the little girl. I am trying hard not to spoil anything which means I can't even go over much of the plot. But rest assured Raffey Cassidy will melt your heart. Her relationship with Clooney is super-poignant.

Sucks that this movie didn't do better in the box office. Disney so obviously wanted to turn this into a mammoth franchise like PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN. I don't know now that there'll be a sequel. I blame the third act. No, it didn't ruin the movie for me, but it did put a tarnish on the shine. A perceptible tonal shift kicks in in the third act, and it's at this junction, seems to me, that the film forfeits that sense of wide-eyed wonder for something jarringly preachy and stale. And while it's Casey's mighty striving to reach Tomorrowland - and her adventures and her coming-of-age en route - that makes this movie so brilliant, I wish to have seen even more content in Tomorrowland, its culture, its peoples, its shiny, shiny technology. The story also suffers some from being absent of a truly hissable big bad. But the big let down for me was the finding out of the thing that was wrong and the thing that had to be done to save the day. Those were deflating moments since the film had built its momentum up and up and up and then meh.

But, hey, here's me trying to be like Casey Newton, an optimist. So I now choose to gloss over the flaws and fte the positives which do outweigh the flaws, and overwhelmingly, at that. If you didn't see this on the big screen, you have missed out. This is some panoramic sh--. I can absolutely see TOMORROWLAND having a strong afterlife in DVD and Blu Ray sales and in video streaming. And even if there is this apocalyptic countdown, TOMORROWLAND is primarily a bright, upbeat movie, a striking counterpoint to the bleak, knee-buckling dystopia of THE HUNGER GAMES and MAD MAX. And I love Katniss and Max, but, damn, give me a star-gazing, problem-solving, NASA-cap-wearing optimist like Casey anyday. I've my own sack of angst to deal with, thanks.",1447027200,,3928,4.685507246376812

We almost didn't watch it because of all of the negative reviews by the film critics, but we took a chance and we are very glad we did.  The acting was good.  I was glad to see George Clooney stretch a bit---he was still Clooney, but you could feel the changes in his character as the movie progressed.  As he began to hope, you wanted to hope with him.  This is a movie with a real message.  If we recognize the need for a change in our lives. The we still have hope to make that change.

I love movies, I'm a big fan of sci-fi, and I'm easy to please, just entertain me or make make me think, or see the world in a different way. This movie offered none of that. It's grindingly slow, but doesn't give you enough depth to want to root for anyone,  It doesn't even present the core conflict until the final fifteen minutes. Sure the special effects are pretty good and the main characters likable, but ultimately there's nothing there. I almost felt taken.  The only scene that was the least bit compelling takes place in the last five minutes of the film. Earnest with almost no sense of humor whatsoever, only three characters with dimension beyond one, and virtually no optimism or sense of hope.  Incompetent direction. Hopeless writing, and ultimately an incredibly forgettable story. How Clooney or Disney ever agreed to attach their brand to this is beyond comprehension.

If you are largely anti- 'intro>verse>chorus>verse>chorus>bridge>outro' like me, you might like the alternate take on story structure and pacing.  I will say the 'villain' is pretty weak.

What a missed opportunity.  The movie could have been great had it been executed correctly.  I don't know who would be to blame in the process of it being made.  Seems everyone fell short enough to make it a disaster.

7129194,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"Disneys Tomorrowland is a most imaginative, elaborate adventure with a lot of heart.  The idea of the movie is fresh and unique.  Every dollar of the $190 million budget is put to use and is seen on the big screen. Directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), Tomorrowland stars George Clooney, Britt Robertson, Hugh Laurie and Raffey Cassidy.

The movie starts with the history of the two main characters, Frank Walker (George Clooney) and Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), and how they were recruited to visit Tomorrowland. Frank is a young inventor (played by the young actor, Thomas Robinson) who enters a contest at the 1964 Worlds Fair with a jet pack that he assembles out of an Electrolux vacuum.  While he doesnt win, he does meet a charming girl, Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who helps him get to the land of the future: Tomorrowland.  She gives him a special, temporary teleportation pin that allows him to be in the real world but also be in Tomorrowland at the same time.  Its a space-time continuum trinket.  Twenty-five years later, Casey Newton, a teenager with a scientific-based mindset, is arrested for sabotaging a NASA launch pad.  When she collects her belongings after her Dad posts bail, a pin is among her things. She picks it up and is surprised when she is teleported to another dimension. She also meets Athena, who guards her on her journey to meet Frank. Athena has recruited Frank and Casey to fix the future of Earth using the technology of Tomorrowland.  Frank and Casey are chosen because of their scientific know-how as well as their optimistic, dreamer outlook on life. The rest of the movie is a miraculous, heart-pounding adventure with robotically engineered characters, great locations and lots of laser weapons and futuristic grenades.

The creativity of Tomorrowland is extraordinary.  The film is vibrant and bright.  The music, art direction and set design are amazing.  A lot of time, money and craft went into making this movie.  Also, there is a lot of humor in the film.  Like Brad Birds first wonderful film, The Iron Giant, Tomorrowland has a lot of heart. There is a lot of love put into this film and the message of the movie has a lot of love as well - love for human ingenuity, love for individual uniqueness and especially love for the Earth.  My favorite part of the movie is when the robotic agents try to terminate Frank and Casey at Franks house.  Franks creative, dangerous, extravagant security system saved their lives. A funny part of the film is the facial expressions of the leader of the robotic agents.  His smile is so creepy, funny and plastic at the same time.

I give Tomorrowland 5 out of 5 stars.  It is rated PG and, is appropriate for kids from age 6 to 18.  Reviewed by Clayton P, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more youth reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org.",1446508800,2,2819,4.735655737704918
7129195,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"I really liked this movie. After reading a few of the top reviews I decided to write one as well, because though the reviewers I read did a fair job of listing the persons involved and what happens, I felt that some of actual message of the movie was overlooked. The story line follows a boy (young Frank Walker) played by Thomas Robinson - later played by George Clooney,  along with a young girl, Casey Newton - played by Britt Robertson, as they are recruited by Athena (Raffey Cassidy) , a synthetic girl designed to select special people to take part in the creation of a new world in a parallel dimension called Tommorowland. A pin is given to the potential candidate that serves as both a temporary view into the parallel world, as well as an invitation for those who are willing to risk attempting to enter. Tomorrowland is filled with intelligent, creative people who are inventing amazing gadgets and technology with the idea of making the world a better place, without the politics and worries of of living in the world we live in now. The acting is very good, and the set design is superb. The editing is pretty well done, though I thought it moved a little too fast in places, but then again, most of the sets were huge and inspiring and there was so much to see in this movie that I imagine there was a lot left on the cutting room floor just for time's sake. I especially liked the scene where Casey first walks into the clearing, and is able to witness the rockets taking off to explore the universe. The buoyant optimism is the stuff my dreams are made of. At least the happy ones! I think this movie is one most could watch over and over and is definitely a triumph of the silver screen.
The problem I have with this movie is the sort of adolescent, naive message. If you have ever read Atlas Shrugged, you can see how this movie borrows heavily from it's premise, in which lots of people decide to go somewhere else to create a place where smart people can work in peace and harmony and get things done they wouldn't be able to otherwise. The problem with Tomorrowland is that it seems to be an autocracy, headed by David Nix (Hugh Laurie). I can see where Clooney, with his politics and ideals was able to embrace this movie whole heartedly, even though it pokes fun at some of his ultra left wing, environmentalist thinking, it also confirms them at the same time. The phrase ""Feed the Right Wolf"" is repeated several times, and I assume is meant to be some sort of proverb to take away from the film, a mantra for those who are easily mantranized I guess. The problem with that type of thinking is that all wolves will eat you!  The another issue is that creating a world where there are no problems and difficulties would not include human beings. Thinly veiled throughout the film is the idea that of course humans are destroying themselves, but that if we all get together and start believing that we won't. we can stop the destruction. By thinking pessimistically we are propagating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not true. The truth is that it takes both the optimistic and the pessimists working toward common goals in different ways to perpetuate a sustainable human world. The other idea is that humans love dystopian futures. That's why people play destructive video games and watch movies about destruction. Hilarious and totally untrue.  The reason people do that is because it's safe to do so. If that were to start becoming a reality, which it is in some parts of the world already, it wouldn't be considered fun. There is a scientific notion referred to as the Great Filter that this movie alludes to as well. Fortunately the movie doesn't try to solve the worlds problems in it's 2 hours and 11 minutes, but leaves with the idea of either pessimism or optimism, obviously choosing optimism as the better of the two. However, I would disagree. I think courage, balance and humility is probably a better choice, but I'll take optimism any day. That's how I felt after watching this movie, and any movie that inspires hope is ok with me!

7129243,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"It just makes me sad that an amazing film like ""Tomorrowland"" was so mistreated and undervalued when it came out on theaters on last May. In fact, I consider it as one of the best movies of 2015. The story is so imaginative, comedic and a gem among ""children's movies"" of 2015.
With a smart script, well-developed characters, stunning special effects and good acting by its three leads, George Clooney, Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy, Tomorrowland is a treat for children and adults from beginning to end. There's a lot of action, comedy mixed with a little bit of science and futuristic aspects that make this film a keeper and on its way to become a timeless classic. Even though it's a children movie, Tomorrowland also shows the sad reality we live nowadays: the slow extinction of creativity and dreaming and how we ""people from the present"" are not doing anything to change that.
The film knows how to be serious when it has to be serious, but smart and funny, all at the same time. I'm just sad it wasn't a box office or critic success because it might be a movie hard to understand, so don't listen to critics on this one, and believe me, you'll agree for how badly this movie was misunderstood.
I'm happy to add this movie to my Blu-Ray collection, filled with amazing bonus features like deleted scenes or featurettes. If you haven't seen this movie give it a chance!",1446336000,5,1381,4.617886178861789

7129246,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"Well, I think this is obvious, but there are SPOILERS ahead.

This wonderful-but-flawed movie did not disappoint me when it arrived in theatres or in Blu-ray.  I hope this movie is seen by more people now that it is available for streaming and purchase.

The Blu-ray features a wonderful cartoon short film to introduce the entire concept of Plus Ultra and the creation of Tomorrowland.  Then it resolves into the theatrical film.  That is a good way to watch it I think.

The original opening (an introduction by the two stars, George Clooney as Frank Walker and Britt Robertson as Casey Newton) is still there right after the animated short and it is still a problem in terms of narrative.  It is really unnecessary.  I wonder if it is only there so that younger audience members aren't scared too much by the later points of the movie.  If you know the two main character survive, it tends to take some of the meanace out of the later proceedings.

But this misfire doesn't last long.  Almost immediately we are taken via flashback to 1964 and the NY World's Fair.  I think it would have been better just to start there.  Why?  Because once we get to 1964 I had the best 10 minutes of my life watching a film ever.  Seriously.  It captured everything I love about movies -- adventure, wonder, mystery, and even a little romance.

It was outstanding.  I think I've watched the World's Fair sequence 20 times since we received the Blu-ray, Totally worth it.

It builds your expectation that Tomorrowland will be wonderful.

And I think that may be the point.  (Maybe intentionally ?), the movie was filled with all of the **expectation** and joy of Tomorrowland -- until you actually got there!!  When the movie finally arrives with older Frank and Casey at the very end, Tomorrowland is not as we thought it would be. Then, instead of jet packs and wonder, the long lines kind of ruined it (e.g., Hugh Laurie's speech was a bit too long, the overlong reminiscence by Athena could have been shortened, etc.). Just like Tomorrowland. It is a wonderful place, but waiting for the rides is never quite as much fun as just riding them.

In fact, after a long day, it can even seem tiresome.

Seem. But in reality Tomorrowland exerts its magic even through your disappointment and fatigue.

The film is just like the ""real"" Tomorrowland,in that regard.  I can hardly wait to go back to the film version again!!!

EXTRAS: the extras are interesting and fun, particularly a ""mock up"" of a Disney TV show featuring David Nix (Hugh Laurie) in the 1960's.  Somehow, seeing the Nix character interact with the Disney staff was the most charmin thing I've ever seen.  There's nothing like a sourpuss to make you appreciate a little saccharine. :-)",1446336000,4,2736,4.677148846960168

7129250,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"What would happen if the smartest people in the world got together without interference from others and decided to make our planet a much better place to live?  That's the major theme of Tomorrowland.  Optimism and hope and the will to change are what makes this film a sheer success in my opinion.  A lot of viewers didn't like this movie for whatever reason or reasons.  I almost didn't watch it myself, but changed my mind at the last second and decided to give it a chance.  I'm certainly glad I did.  It brought out the child inside me and make me laugh in various places.  That's getting more difficult for a movie to do to me nowadays, and when it unexpectedly happens, I'm thrilled and delighted to say the least.

Okay, I instinctively knew I was going to like this film from the very beginning with the kid running into the World's Fair in 1963 to show his invention of the jet pack to the judges.  I know what a jet pack is from having watched the movie, Thunderball, in 1966.  The child won me over, as did Hugh Laurie (I haven't seen him since House was cancelled on TV) as the judge who rejects the invention and later as the governor of Tomorrowland.  I also loved the young girl, Athena, with the brightness of hope in her eyes, all of her freckles, and definitely her martial arts skills.  She fights like Jackie Chan.  George Clooney and Britt Robertson played their roles with skill and conviction, plus it was George who actually caused me to laugh the most with his eye rolling and constantly being interrupted as he attempted to explain something.  I have to admit that sometimes I feel like his character.

I certainly thought the CGI special effects were awesome with the flying jet packs, cars, trains, space ships, and swimming pools of water that were staggered in the air above one another and had divers jumping through them from the top one to the bottom pool, and the city of the future, not to mention the space ship taking off from inside the Eiffel Tower.

Maybe a lot of it was stupid, but it was a fun movie for me and definitely for kids of a certain age.  Even the music to the film reminded me of cuts from other movie soundtracks such as Stargate, Star Wars, and the tail end of The Mummy.  Would I watch this film again?  Most definitely, even with the plugs for Disneyland in it.  This film gave me optimism for the future, and that's a difficult thing to do in these days and times of such chaotic world events taking place every single day.",1446249600,5,2484,4.429515418502203

We must however give appropriate credit to the actors who were able to appear credible in spite of the ludicrous lines they had to deliver. Except for George Clooney, who seemed to be searching off-stage more than once, perhaps looking for his agent to get him out of this!

This movie feels about as genuine as hydrogenated cool whip on a Twinkie with saccharin on top.  I think it was written and directed by Deep Blue, after synthesizing every sappy, schlocky, moralizing, one dimensional, eco-disaster POS ever made as a plot to subvert and destroy every shred of humanity and thought that the audience may or may ever have.  Either that or Steven Spielberg is involved.
This move is the humanist answer to ""The Rapture"", and the only people going to the promised land are Native Americans who install wind turbines.. or ""hippy chicks"" who draw with crayons on the sidewalk.

7129323,1,B00WAJ8RBI,"Disney is making some horrible movies these days. Outside of their Marvel subdivision, every big-budget blockbuster going back to maybe the first Pirates has been rather bad, or at least severely underwhelming. Tomorrowland might be amongst their worst, where its atrociousness sinks even its heretofore flawless director.

This film just doesnt know what to do, who it is, or where to go. Sure, theres the retro-futuristic production design thats spiffy to look at. But besides the CG in the background, the story is a total mess. Clooney is barely in this thing and shouldve stayed home, but the two girl leads aren't much better though. Like its muddling marketing campaign, the film itself is too heavily invested in mystifying the viewer about what is actually happening with zero payoff. But instead of being a pleasant adventure and intriguing mystery, the story is an annoying jumble of confusion. By the time the great curtain is finally lifted, this wannabe fairy tale still cant really figure things out without pulling strange ridiculousness out of thin air to answer its numerous self-inflicted plot holes.

Little kids might not mind the stupidity and gush at the robots and flying cars, though those scenes are few and far between. Everyone else should skip this trip.",1445904000,7,1283,5.104761904761904

7129347,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"Viewers can be forgiven for dismissing this film out of hand; too many movies have been spun out of Disneyland attractions.  What's next?  ""Jungle Cruise: The Motion Picture""?  ""Frontierland""?  The presence of George Clooney - a thoughtful man and activist as well as a movie star - invites a look.  And what a look!  The film is beautifully slick and glossy, full of eye-candy.  Nostalgic geezers like myself might shed a tear listening to the saccharine strains of ""It's a Bright, Beautiful Tomorrow,"" the theme music for Disney's long-extinct Carousel of Progress attraction.  But after cracking through that shell, what does one find?  Something bland and slightly sinister.

The first half of the film is designed to elicit feelings of nostalgia.  Much of the utopia pictured is reminiscent of the old Tomorrowland architecture.  There's even a prominent building in the background which is a carbon copy of the old Space Mountain attraction.  And in the middle of it is an inspiring Boy Edison imp.

The second half reflects more modern sensibilities.  It's an admission that the projected future never came, that America and the world are a mess.  But as in so many modern sci-fi films, a pretty girl-messiah is waiting in the wings.

After an increasingly frantic build-up, the climax is a terribly preachy sermon, a horse-pill too bulky to swallow.  It sneers at all dystopian literature and films, saying that the pessimism they engendered is the reason that utopia never came.  It never concedes that all those dystopias reflected the long, slow collapse of the myth of progress, not that they throttled it.  There is something terribly smug and self-satisfied about Tomorrowland's thesis - from the obvious knowledge that it was written by the tiny cadre of comfortable ""haves,"" to the final scenes worshipping the entrepreneurial ubermench of the world.  It's about time for Clooney and company to get out of their Mickey Mouse white tower, and meet the peasants.",1445731200,2,1976,5.074534161490683

7129349,1,B00WAJ8RBI,"Most disappointing movie of all time.  It had such story potential for Walt Disney fans with the backstory that Walt and other real geniuses from history had created a secret society and even a secret place.  And the tie-in to the 1964 World's Fair is awesome.  Or it should have been.  There's even enough mysterious true material that could have been used like the time capsule that is buried there to this day containing the book that Albert Einstein and others contributed to for future generations.  But no.  It seems even a good story potential, with a Director that loves Walt Disney and understands the importance of story, is powerless to thwart being hijacked by the uber-leftist religion that is global warming / climate change and their smarter-than-you cultist members like Geroge Looney.  It's beyond supprising that Bird would allow Walt's ""Dreamer"" mentality to be distorted and twisted into this sort of definition.  Incredibly disappointing.

7129370,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"The second star is just because I did not completely hate the looks of it, but maybe it is time to stop making feature length commercials for toys and rides, Disney? It is not before an 1:40h mark before you in fact learn what is going on in this movie. The story is fractured at best, if not completely non-existing. Characters are, well, non-characters, just empty vessels for you to join the ride, and that ride lacks thrills or even mild entertainment. George Clooney is pretty aware that this is nothing to put the effort in, so he doesn't. And charm is not enough this time around. Hugh Laurie is trying his best, and would have been great if there was anything to work with. And he is not given any time to establish either the character or his motivation. I am not sure this one works even for kids, I remember kids movies having the story that holds your attention, depth of emotion and even strong intellectual impact.

The story is very relatable to our current daily struggle as a culture on the brink of self destruction. I found myself on the very edge of my seat, quite literally, for the entire second half of the movie. In an industry filled with movies seemingly made just because we have the technology and effects to make it, mass produced soulless films that have no repeat viewing value. This film with its perfect balance of awe and realism, strife and successes was a refreshing and unexpectedly pleasant example of the seemingly lost art of storytelling and whimsical movie making.

Alright folks, step right up!  Who wants a ticket to Tomorrowland?!  What, you ask, IS Tomorrowland?  Well, Tomorrowland is a futuristic and magical place where artists and scientists can create whatever they desire, without the inhibitions of politics, greed, or the hoi poloi.  And how do you get there?  Well, all you have to do is be a DREAMER.  And what, you ask, is a Dreamer?  A Dreamer is a bright, talented person living right here right now who hasn't given in to negativity or given up on making the world a better place.  Our recruiters will find you and whisk you away from all this...this...all this stuff that drags you down and take you where you never have to worry about the future any more.  Never mind that the present NEEDS you to keep doing good work in order to avert disaster...

Clooney was alright, but the human female was pure political correctness social engineering party line. The best character in the film was the robot girl. She was a pleasure to watch. Overall, it was a propaganda movie for the the global warning fear mongers of today. During the Cold War we had the arms race/nuclear war fear mongers. The goal of both is the same: control by fear. The movie was well done so it did not fail at that level.

7129485,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"I really enjoyed this. It has plenty of small flaws and problems but, overall, a good honest job, great acting, great effects, great look, and reasonable effort at a storyline.

This is very much in the same genre as ""Back to the Future,"" ""The Last Starfighter,"" and ""The Rocketeer."" It is full of allusions or hommages or perhaps simply lazy thefts from other movies. Tomorrowland seen across a field of yellow grain and the Emerald City of Oz seen across the field of poppies, and so forth.

I loved the ""Athena"" character, played by an actress named Raffey Cassidy. As always, George Clooney does a convincing job acting in the character of George Clooney. I thought actress Britt Robertson was completely convincing but unfortunately I didn't love her character. (She has a tough job. Her role is to save the world through the strength of her innocent optimism and faith in a wonderful future. She is a little too transfixed, a little too enchanted, a little too often, whenever she gets a peek at the future. The future has the ""look"" of the 1964 New York World's Fair. I visited that fair personally in 1964 and I didn't actually think it was all that wonderful).

I honestly appreciated the screenwriters for putting in the effort to produce a reasonably coherent storyline, with up-to-SF-standards ""scientific"" explanations (it's all done with tachyons).

I don't want to put in any spoilers so I'll just say I loved what they did with the Eiffel Tower. A number of the characters, including Athena, are some kind of robots and I loved their success in putting these characters precisely in the middle of the ""uncanny valley,"" and I wonder how it was done--was it pure acting, or was some kind of CGI involved?

I assume it got its PG rating because of longish fight and ""action"" sequences of stuff and people hitting each other and exploding, etc.",1445472000,,1856,4.769470404984424
7129486,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"I know this did not get very good reviews. I don't care. I watch a lot of films and have for pretty much all of my life. I read criticism, I read reviews, I'm into cinema. I'm also into science fiction, big time. I thought this film was fun. It was a visual kick, the storyline was good enough to make me care about the characters. The ultimate factor for me was that it made me feel good. Sometimes, that's enough. Tomorrowland isn't a film where we question our existence, our we suffer from depression because the future is so bleak. This is just an effect filled film that made me feel good. I liked it and if other people don't, that's ok with me.",1445385600,3,652,4.224

7129488,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Seeing Tomorrowland for the second time is infinitely more satisfying than seeing it for the first. It's a movie that, even with such spectacular visuals, is largely an intimate, earthbound story about several relationships and the potential of humankind.

The trailers and preview clips could not help raise expectations for a movie that didn't exist. Either that, or the movie we saw was not the movie edited as intended. Maybe something was missing that had been there before, in addition to the deleted scenes included on the Blu-ray.

Like the World's Fair and the Disney Parks versions of Tomorrowland, the first thing one might expect of this film would be a live-action Jetsons with pithier undertones. George Clooney chooses most of his first because of meaning as well as story. The overall message is very powerful and inspiring (without giving anything away), but the movie itself is largely a simple and small drama with action set pieces.

Seeing it again, knowing what it will not deliver helps the viewer appreciate the uniformly fine performances of the young players. A second view also eliminates the (sorry) letdown when the film's dogged pursuit of a fantasmagorical new world where we spend lots of time and get to know what life is like there and Rosie the Robot and all...well, once Hugh Laurie and George Clooney face off after Laurie hits him with the standard sci-fi ""those puny humans are such useless fools"" it brings back memories of such confrontations at the end of each Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman episode.

That said, props to Brad Bird and his team for risking an original story in a film marketplace dependent on sure things like sequels and movies with stars who do the same things in each of their movies. Hopefully Bird's not out of the original live action movie business quite yet.

The Blu-ray looks magnificent -- this movie is worth marveling at if only for the loving, meticulous recreation of the 1964 New York World's Fair, something that we can never visit in real life -- and that's really what movies can do for us, isn't it? The Emerald City-like moments of flight are wonderful, too, and remind one of such a sequence in Disney's underrated Meet the Robinsons, another film that was undefinable and turned out to be a superb experience if approached with no previews or sneak peeks.

Alas, there is no audio commentary for Bird to further explain his vision, which, despite whatever strengths and weaknesses are -- is earnest, sincere and fascinating. We spend some time with him and the cast and crew at Kennedy Space Center and the awe with which they see the structures and gadgets is very real indeed.

My favorite bonus feature is something we rarely experience on bonus features, some time with the composer. It was charming and informative, as Michael Giacchino's brother narrated and took video of a day in his life (what's the deal with the peppers?) and truly marvelous when Richard Sherman visited the music studio to hear the orchestra perform ""There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow."" What a great big, beautiful moment it was. Giacchino's awe was akin to that his colleagues at the Space Center.

Fun fact:  In the shop scene, the disc is placed on the album cover of a 1979 Disneyland Storyteller Record of The Black Hole. Ironically, that film is also better on the second viewing because it does not pay off the anticipation of what the black hole is like. Seeing it again, it's a fine space opera romp for a Saturday afternoon.",1445385600,3,3509,4.825291181364393
7129489,4,B00WAJ8RBI,Enjoyed the film despite some obvious flaws. Britt Robertson is outstanding as is Clooney in an unusual role for him. It is too long and the plot a little murky but I didn't find it overly preachy. Perhaps a little scary for little ones but my little neice watches The Waertainlylking Dead so what do I know.

7129494,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"I saw the first 15 minutes or so of the film in a preview at Disneyland and it got me PUMPED to see the movie. Then I saw it. Apparently those 15 minutes are the best the film ever gets. Frank's younger self storyline was the movie I wish we'd gotten to see. Instead we got a boring sequel-ish film. Sure, there's some good action and imagination and if that's all you care about this movie is for you. But if you want a fulfilling plot that makes any kind of sense, don't look here. **Spoilers to follow**

The main girl (Casey maybe? We'll go with that.) is super special. She's really good at . . . well, as far as I can tell, blowing things up. And that's it. She has a Dad who worked for NASA, so probably she can invent something cool, like a jet pack, right? Nope. She doesn't do ANYTHING the whole movie, except be really good at looking surprised and shocked. And then when it comes time to use her special skill of blowing crap up, she can't even manage that. You had one job to do Casey. ONE!

The rest of the movie is basically teasing us with the cool backstory of Frank (George Clooney's character) and making us wish we were watching that instead of Casey being surprised by what happens when she touches the coin for the umpteenth time. I'm not really sure what the purpose of Casey was to the story. Seriously, other than getting the plot going, what was the point of her? We could have easily taken care of the whole story with just George Clooney and robot girl.

Anyway, somewhere in an alternate universe we got to enjoy the movie of young Frank and weren't forced into extreme disappointment with this nonsensical waste of time. Again, if you just like action scenes and cool sets, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, meh.",1445299200,,1746,4.3496932515337425

7129496,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"I gave this 5 stars mostly for the theme; which my guess is why George Clooney decided to do the project. The story is good, the effects are great. The theme (which for a family movie I absolutely love) is that the future can be fantastic but, it takes work today for results tomorrow. Underlying that is the sub-theme that crying about a problem solves nothing if you're not willing to do anything to fix it. Fun movie to watch, good performances all around.

The villain's speech in the middle where he describes humanity's death wish is priceless, I noticed someone posted it on youtube. Yes, we need to save our planet, and no one else is going to do it for us, the movie's clear message is about responsibility for our actions and doesn't preach it, any movie that enlightens people about us ""dreamers"" who are out there actually DOING things instead of tweeting about how bad things are or posting selfies all day long on Facebook, and demonstrating total apathy for life, is ok in my book. Everything you see around you was dreamt by someone and made into a reality, we need to quit focusing on the negative and put our attention on the beautiful possibilities of our future, and this is what this movie does, BLESS DISNEY. I watched it on iTunes but now I'm going to buy it on Bluray so I can watch it again. Everything in it is first class, the stars, the acting, the CGI stuff, the story. This is not a kiddie movie but is aimed at the kid in all of us, and I applaud Disney for putting this shot across the bow, into mass consciousness, where it is sorely needed. The girl was really good and I got the feeling she studied the Amy Pond character in the Dr. Who series, and brought that kind of energy to this flick. I would rank this right up there with Interstellar, but the scifi movie snobs are going to diss it because there wasn't alot of explosions and galactic explosions and no blood.

A good movie for kids, certainly nothing objectionable.  There's just one little problem, It made no sense at all.  If your child says ""Daddy, I really liked the movie;  What does it mean?"" You will be very hard pressed to find an answer. It was certainly a hodgepodge mix of dire concerns about the future, not just global warming but all the correct buzz topics.  I'm not certain that Miss South Carolina wrote the screenplay.  Perhaps she was just a consultant.  And it's not just the theme of the movie that's muddled; It's the literal plot that never adds up.

The FX were outstanding, but felt like a mix of Terminator meets Disney -- lacking a bit of the usual ""it will all turn out okay"" feeling present in most Disney films.

If the type of people who support someone like Ayn Rand and her selfish ideology represent the worst in us, hopefully the people who watch this movie and are inspired by it will represent the best in us. It may seem like an overestimation of the power of a summer blockbuster, but that's the language we speak now. Since we aren't moved by the reality of our plight, we need to be moved by the possibility of something better. We can be better, we can do better; we are just animals, and our knowledge of this allows us to supersede our animality. Whether or not we actually will is up to us, alone. Not for selfish, personal reasons, not because we want to make it better immediately for ourselves, but for every single generation that comes after.

We are bombarded these days with negative information about politics, congress, the President, global warming, political correctness and demonization of our past.

Now, a film with incredible special effects, a positive outlook which makes it clear that making a difference does not mean simply smiling and saying nice things.  The world is dangerous, no doubt......but WE can make a difference in our own lives and in others.

Let me repeat: a movie with a positive overall outlook, excellent special effects...and incredibly talented cast (except for some slightly wooden acting by Tim McGraw...but who cares...the guy can sing like a song bird).

This is not a ""feel good"" movie with platitudes and empty aphorisms.  It is multiple lessons in one of the greatest strengths of our society and country too often downplayed by social and popular media: don't give up and YOU can make a difference.

Early in the movie, Casey's teachers all spout doom and gloom over society and global warming.  Casey puts her hand up in each class but is only given the opportunity to speak in one.  She asks, ""Can we fix it?""

Great question, Casey.  And, by the way....Athena is and the actress who plays her are excellent in this movie.

7129521,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"Tomorrowland is a sci-fi adventure film that centers on two characters (Casey Newton and Frank Walker) who work together to reach the mythical place only known as Tomorrowland, where the best and brightest thinkers, dreamers and creators could come together to change the world for the better, a secret place free of politics and restrictions. Co-written and directed by Brad Bird, who brought us some Disney's most imaginatives movies in the past ten years and even Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Tomorrowland is truly a one-of-a-kind adventure.

Honestly, I'm beyond annoyed and disappointed that this movie was a box office failure and only got mixed reviews, because, why? I've read most of the reviews, and they always say that because the movie was unbalanced and didn't follow a linear plot, it lost steam. Did these people even watch the damn thing? Tomorrowland, like it's titular place, isn't balanced, but chock full of mystery and imagination. The writing wasn't Oscar-worthy in any way, but was good none the less. It was family-friendly, while carrying more mature themes (as well as a few dark moments). The lead cast was great, Britt Robertson was fun and goofy as Casey, while Clooney was superb as Frank, giving the movie a bit more gravitas than one would expect. Even Hugh Laurie as Nix was a surprise, and much appreciated. But it was Raffey Cassidy as Athena who stole the show in nearly every scene, the mysterious little girl who introduced Tomorrowland to both our leads, decades apart. The visual effects were beyond stunning, and absolutely gorgeous, mixing the cinematography with the futuristic landscape that looked real in every way, being way too complicated to not be. And even Michael Giacchino's score, which sounded like a John Williams masterpiece, was wonderfully brilliant and beautiful. But it was Bird's direction that made the film shine, even when things slowed down or got dark. He wanted to give us an adventure as big as the imagination of a child, a world that could span far across the void of space, and we got it.

The movie isn't for everyone, and obviously some people didn't like it, but look at this movie objectively: it's a sci-fi adventure about making the world a better place, forever. This is a movie that, while not everyone will like, needs to be seen by everyone, because there is something here for everyone, whether it's action, comedy or the sheer visual splendor. I've never had so much fun going to the movies with Tomorrowland, feeling like I was watching Jurassic Park or even Lawrence of Arabia again as a kid, that sweeping feeling of wanting to be a part of the adventure. I finally got that, and I hope you do too.

Factor in a hopelessly naive and cliched message about how dreamers can change the world, and Tomorrowland ironically inspires more cynicism than hope as the speech the main bad guy delivers (Hugh Laurie) is more on the nose than the blindly optimistic spunk of heroine Casey Newton.",1445040000,,666,4.75

7129526,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"Tomorrowland's blurb on movie websites and on the back of the cover, didn't form a clear picture of what the heck this movie was going to be about, to say it was confusing was an understatement.  I figured once I got into the film I'd get it and I did like the actors that were in it so I figured I'd give it a go.  At the conclusion of the movie I still don't really know what the end part was all about but I enjoyed the movie anyway.  Once it gets going it has plenty of action and the acting by the child actors is very, very good.

I will try and keep some things vague but you will encounter some mild spoilers if you continue to read on.  I can see how it would be annoying to some people but I liked how the movie changed the type of scifi movie it was as it progressed, we started off as a typical child saves the world film, with both the young child Clooney character and a mysterious same aged girl he obviously has a crush on motivating him to follow her in a 60's flashback and also a modern day set Brit Robertson's character (she's playing a teen in this one) who 80's movie style looks like she's going to outsmart the grownups with her inventions such as a drone that can disable security cameras so she can sabotage what she sees as a wrong, the adults dismantling of NASA's launch pad.

Then we switch to a secret MIB style organisation experience revolving around a pin, then the film plays homage to cybornetic organisms trying to kill a threat, there's even an obvious remake or the T1000 running after the police car from Terminator 2 scene.  Then we go to the angry at the world grumpy man who doesn't want to let the annoying teenager into his house who he knows full well has no choice in the matter but to be there. Of course we've seen the booby trapped house with a well thought out with inventions escape plan a thousand times before as well.  Then of course we've got the this is the chosen one who will save the day that we've seen in Star Wars and plenty of other movies.  Now I didn't really quite understand the last part and the role Casey was supposed to play in the ""she can fix it"" destiny she had, but the movie still lots of fun anyway.

Some parts weren't that realistic such as a smashed windshield not affecting a rocket going into space, when we know it affects passenger planes and also what happened to a shuttle with a cracked tile.  But I liked realistically they allowed collateral damage with humans such as the fireman getting vaporised or the Eiffel Tower security guard that Casey knocked out as well as tourists on the ground getting burnt up when the rocket launched.  It would be easy for a Disney film not to include that and dumb down the realism.  They still did in moments such as a tell you how great you are before I finally die speech that conveniently finishes just as death claims the character.

Even though I didn't really understand the whole point of going into the alternative dimension and why Casey was even needed there, the film was entertaining and the journey from beginning to end a lot of fun.  It does go for over two hours and the extras show the cast and crew expecting to film at the NASA launch pad but being surprised by watching the Mars rocket take off.  Being that the two male adult main actors achieved their megastar status being top doctors in TV hospitals, it would have been nice if there had been a throw away line like, ""you know, we could have wasted out intelligence being doctors or something but instead chose to do this,"" by one to the other.",1445040000,2,3544,4.3147590361445785

I liked this movie because it helped restore some of that sense of wonder and the feeling that our current world can be fixed so we can get back to that wondrous future.  The three main characters were great and the on-screen chemistry among them was fun to watch.  Special effects were very good, for the most part.

7129532,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"This movie is one of those that for me is hard to give an ultimate rating because I can see why it didn't do well in theaters but at the same time has some things going for it that make it better than most bad movies.  This movie is one that almost feels like it is out of time, kind of like its theme with its very classic Disney feel.  In my opinion, this movie would have done better if it had been released a few decades ago with its overly optimistic and a bit preachy theme that it has as this seems to me to be a bit too much for todays movie audiences.  I am not saying that I didn't like the film though as it does have some redeeming qualities that made it ok for me to watch.  The visual and special effects are outstanding and you can see where the big budget was spent with the fantastic effects.  Cassidy as Athena also plays her role well and I think was the highlight of the actors in the movie.  The story and plotline to me was a bit scattered and lacked a bit of focus.  It was hard for me to figure out what type of audience the movie was trying to go for because at times it felt like a kids movie and at times seemed to be trying to please adults as well.  That back and forth took away from the cohesiveness of the movie and trying to please both kids and adults falls a bit flat at times.  The movies final scenes were a bit anti-climactic as well.

Is the movie as bad as some say? No I don't think so.  Nor do I think that this is a great movie.  Tomorrowland falls somewhere in between as an average one that had potential to be much more but falls a bit short of its ambitions and of its big budget. I enjoyed watching the movie; I just think it falls a bit short as a blockbuster.

There's a whole lot of sound and fury wrapped up in a poorly plotted story. The visual effects are well-done, but that's the movie's biggest accomplishment, and if that's all you're looking for you can get better at the theme park rides. The level of violence makes me question what audience this film's targeted at. It's far too violent for young children, and from the amount of political preechifying it seems to me it's supposed to be a movie for grownups. But if it is, then we should have had better writing, which pretty much takes us back to the start of the vicious circle.

Yet, as I watched it with my 3 year old and 6 year old I was horrified at how many (at least 8) blatant swear words were in this film. They didn't even try to say them quietly so young ears didn't catch them. They were loud, drawn out and if my son didn't catch it the first time, then they made sure to repeat it a second and third time to be sure he knows that swear word now. Really Disney? Really? I absolutely will NOT purchase this DVD. I trusted Disney to produce clean movies for my family to watch together. If they want to target it to adults, fine, but don't advertise what a good family film it is then put in a bunch of swear words for my children to hear. That's deceptive and bad marketing.

Gotta wonder who decided it was a good idea to start with not one but two long, dull prologues before the story really gets going, a good 30 minutes in. Once it does get rolling there's a lot of fun and a whole lot of visual dazzle, though the storytelling remains kinda lumpy and keeps threatening to derail things all the way to the end. A cleaner, zippier, less Basil Exposition movie might have been a great summer action flick. As it is, for all the visual panache and some good acting from the youngsters in the cast, it's just mildly entertaining and quickly forgettable.",1444953600,5,886,4.759740259740259

Just look around in the shop that was visited. Did you catch the reference to the person for whom  science fiction's "" academy award"" was named after? I don't have the time to go into everything, But just a couple. First don't get caught up on any supposed qusai-metaphysical meaning in the movie. It's there if you want to search for it. That mankind is destroying the world through technology. There is a connection with ""Avatar,"" ""The Matrix,"" & ""Tron"" at the end. There is also a religious connection of one person who is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of mankind.

7129589,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Im just going to blurt it out: Tomorrowland is entertaining, but underwhelmingat least in the beginning.

Even under the capable direction of Brad Bird (Ratatouille, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol) Disneys latest onscreen theme-park ride feels uneven and unnecessarily complicated, especially in the early going. It takes 22 minutes before the film seems to find its footing. Until then, youll have family members asking whats going on and whether the action is taking place in the past, present, future, or distant future. Later, it can be emotionally confusing, as persons we thought were human are struck by a car or beheaded in an explosion (Uh, Disney?)after which we learn that they're really highly refined futuristic robots.

Until the plot kicks in, at least the art direction and set decoration and CGI world that the filmmakers create are all bright and shiny and impeccably rendered. Along with the action, its enough to hold your attention until everything starts to make more sense. Tomorrowland clocks in at 130 minutes, and if Bird had compressed and simplified that beginning it would have been a B+ film. Then again, that opening was obviously intended as a theme park tie-in. Instead of Disney World its the New York Worlds Fair in 1964 that we enter, with a voiceover singing the theme song from the Carousel of Progress and one of the main characters urged to hop aboard a ride that just happens to be a modified version of Its a Small World.

Two very different characters are targeted to receive a T button under mysterious circumstances: a boy genius who brings his Electrolux-converted jet pack to a Worlds Fair Tomorrowland attraction, and a rebellious teen girl who sneaks onto a decommissioned NASA launch pad and is arrested for her trouble. But its only when that teen girl meets the grown-up boy genius that things really start to roll in this fantasy-adventure.

I don't know about hidden Mickeys, but you can spot Space Mountain in the midst of the futuristic world in Tomorrowland, and the special and visual effects are the films chief strength. Not far behind, though, are performances by Thomas Robinson as young Frank, George Clooney as old Frank, and Britt Robertson as Casey Newton. Even Raffey Cassidy as the mysterious Athena, a young girl who spans generations, adds to the mix so that collectively they make us care about the action, however confused it may be at times.

Disney is known for its strong villains, but surprisingly Hugh Laurie as Gov. David Nix, the leader of Tomorrowland, isn't played over-the-top. Hes more of a misguided misanthrope who could be anyones dad fed up with society and resigned to its doom. But the stakes are predictably high: the world will end in the near future unless Casey and Frank can do their thing, despite Nixs attempts to, uh, nix that.

Its really pretty amazing what can be done with CGI these days, and Disney spared no expense. The film cost anywhere from $190 million to $330 million to produce and market, depending upon whose figures you buy. Meanwhile, the worldwide gross was $208 million, so financially its another big-budget Disney disappointment. But both of my teens said theyd definitely watch Tomorrowland again, and that says a lot. Once you get past a muddled beginning the action and story and characters make for an entertaining family movie night.

Language: Mostly hells and damns
Sex: n/a
Violence: Plenty of sci-fi violence, including a charred and decapitated head that turns out to be robotic, humans are killed by ray guns, a robotic girl is run over by a car, and the female lead bashes the heck out of a robot with a baseball bat
Adult situations: A father asks if his daughters on drugs, but thats about it
Takeaway: Effects are great, but story still matters. And once this story kicks in, Tomorrowland is worth the visit.",1444694400,,3845,4.915254237288136

7129594,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"DISNEY' bring a futuristic and special-effects movie to the screen to excite and captivate the imagination of both
the younger viewers and young at heart alike.
We follow the adventure of 'Casey Newton' (Britt Robertson) who is given a badge, at first not knowing from where,
touching it gives her a glimpse of another World a seemingly magical place, but her time runs out with no way back,
or is there ?
'Casey' discovers 'Athena' (Raffey Cassidy) a android from the World beyond had been the one to have given her the
badge......though 'Casey' will have to seek out 'Frank' (George Clooney) who had years before spent much time from
the age of eleven in Tomorrowland.
The story becomes a quest o save the future as 'Nix' (Hugh Laurie) the leader of those that remain on Tomorrowland
fed up with man on Earth ignoring the signs, has determined that Earth's time is almost up.
Leaving 'Frank' 'Casey' with the help of 'Athena' to try and change the course of events.....a chance perhaps to put
things right.
This a very different kind of movie-experience that should hold your interest throughout, there are some scenes of voilence
along the way, nothing too strong.
It's an enjoyable Sci-fi watch certainly worth a spin.

The bad: this was a global warming/climate change BS propaganda film, with far too much violence for a Disney movie geared toward families. If they took the radical Marxist propaganda/violence desensitization BS out of the film, it would deserve four stars. But it's important we do not financially reward Hollywood for preaching their sociopath violence, and big government is the answer to the mythical global warming/change threat...garbage.

If you want to reinforce the BS our kids are learning in government schools, pretending that the world is going to end if we fail to vastly increase government spending and control over business, or if you want to desensitize your kids to violence, this is a perfect movie for the family.

And that is why this movie takes 5 stars, although it is not a super sci fi movie.
But Disney has managed to make a sci fi movie where nobody invades Earth, no
disgusting creatures devour humans, and no human landmarks are destroyed in
huge explosions.
Yes, the fate of this world is at stake here but it is not to be save by force, but rather
by brains (and a small huge super bomb).
This movie is as if they wanted to make an animated film but decided to make it with
real people (well if Dr. House's acting is considered real) and a lot of really nice special effects.
Even the little killing in the movie is bloodless, almost entertaining.
Clooney, Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy (well an AA must have a British accent) make this
movie fun, not only with their jokes, but also with their expressions and the whole feeling the pass on to us
It a real fun movie to watch , while there is a lot of emotion in there and food for thought about our future.

7129604,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"I'm not sure why this movie is getting such mixed reviews. Maybe it's not groundbreaking in plot or storytelling but the visuals and message should serve as inspiration. While not a classic like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-to-the-Future-Part-II/dp/B001LXIDW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back to the Future Part II</a>, it is reminiscent of that movie in giving glimpses of a progressive future while warning of its dystopic alternative.

It reminds us that, while we all may be bogged down by the trappings of our fellow doomsdaying pessimists and mischievers (as opposed to achievers), we make the choice whether to continue on as dreamers even with the negative as well as positive influences around our vulnerable hearts.

Maybe society is guilty of the antagonist's indictment (not just accusation) that people are more inclined to march towards a future that expects less from them. I've even heard complaints by some that the animated classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B0013FSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E (Single-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;was too preachy. In any case, ""Tomorrowland"" tries to impart that we don't have to resign ourselves to being drones awaiting a predetermined fate.

I, for one, appreciate the ambitious effort and story.  This movie, by itself, will likely not compel anyone to make drastic changes overnight, but as part of an overall diet of healthy content--we choose what we consume, engage in, and surround ourselves with, after all--it could subtly influence us to make changes for the better culminating into an overall benefit.

  It gives you a headache if you think about it.  And that is the sad thing about it.  Awesome special effects, a few good themes lost in minutia,  politically correct science that is garbage and the lack of reality to explain the science behind it.
  Too bad it took on the PC theme, it kills the film.  The protagonist overcome by those who have to take on the same traits as the protagonist, it does not work and this film ends up tripping over itself.",1442707200,4,765,4.293706293706293

The young generation should ONLY watch this kind of movies, this way they may ""reprogram"" the way of thinking that has been put into them by the way the society takes as a ""correct"" way. A GREAT movie which shouts to people ""there is more to life than we can see"" and it points out that ""believing is seeing"" - not the other way around....
This Movie is about a Quantum existence, shows us the quantum universe around us and it shows us that we are connected to all around, and that all exist on multiple levels in different dimensions. It is a break thru for the mind and an eye opening for people to think ""what if?"" - it really is like this.... - guess what ? - IT IS. This movie makes us aware of our way of acting in the world - which ""wolf"" do we feed??
Energy Does exist and we are strong generators of our energy into the world. This movie teaches the young (and old ;) that Protesting or paying attention to, is still ""feeding"" the very couse of the protest, which many of us don't  realize, but Promoting its counterpart Accelerates the process of success.
What if we are being monitored and we are being helped? What are we doing on our part to receive that help and to make the change? Try to See this movie with open mind - THERE IS more to the world around us than we can see.

7129619,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"There are bad movies, mediocre movies, and good movies.  And then, every once in a while, there are *great* movies.  A good movie will do a good job telling the audience a story about the characters and the world they live in, but a great movie uses the characters and the setting to tell the audience a true, relevant story about themselves.  Tomorrowland belongs firmly in the latter category.

It makes no secret that this is a story with a moral, an important message, but the execution is pulled off so well that you don't care; it's just that awesome.  And the message, incredibly relevant for today's audiences, is that it doesn't matter how bad the problems you're facing are; they can be overcome if you're willing to focus on finding a solution rather than obsessing about how bad the problem is.  This is something that every one of today's kids needs to hear, because they *are* the ones who are going to either fix tomorrow's problems, or fail to.

But despite the fantastical premise, the ending treats it in a surprisingly realistic way.  Just because the big climactic threat has been overcome, there's no ""everything is magically all better now;"" the world still has very serious problems, and it's time for people to go out and get to work finding solutions to them.  It was refreshing to see that at the end, rather than having some silly ""happy ever after"" cop-out.

I can't recommend Tomorrowland highly enough, especially if you have kids of the appropriate age.  It's fun, well-written and well-executed, and definitely worth watching!",1438300800,30,1558,4.819548872180451
7129620,1,B00WAJ8RBI,"If any of you reading this have either gone through the Tomorrowland attraction or have heard how cool it is then you either have enjoyed a rewarding first-hand experience or can vividly imagine what it's like.  Somehow with this movie the same feeling cannot be found.

The basic gist of this movie is: A beautiful young teen lady named Casey Newton(Britt Robertson) is a child prodigy along side her little brother and her mechanically inclined father(Tim McGraw).  One night Casey attempts to send a spy camera attached to a toy helicopter at some private building to try and find out more about the closing of some space station at Cape Canaveral, in hopes to do something about it and gets caught and arrested in no time flat.  Upon her father coming to spring her from the joint, Casey finds some bracelet with a big ""T"" insignia on it as she picks up her stuff upon release.  It doesn't take long before she starts to see that the bracelet transports Casey to some wheat field and as she walks further a futuristic city.  For some reason, even as she's seeing this futuristic city, her body is still in the real world and as such, Casey doesn't see any objects and whatnot that get in her way.  Also, for some reason as she(unknowlingly) walks through a river the bracelet stops working.  So Casey and her little brother search the internet only to not only find a store in Texas that carries the said bracelet, but finds out that they're really rare.  So she sneaks out of the house at night having only told her brother where she was going, to reach the shop in Texas to get a new bracelet.  When she gets to the store she runs afoul with some deadly robots appearing to be human, with big ray guns bent on killing Casey.  As they destroy some of the store in their attempts, a little robot girl with a cockney British accent named Athena, comes to her rescue and destroys the two menacing robots.  Later on she drops Casey off at the home of a crabby old man(that Athena knew in the past) named Franklin Walker(George Clooney).  At first Franklin was not especially thrilled to be involved in this, but eventually he decides to help.  And soon they get chased around by evil Agent Smith like robots.

Unfortunately everything that transpires after this is too incomprehensible to go into.

As it happens this movie makes a lot of ghastly errors.  For starters all the characters in this movie are complete stereotypes.  The brainy child prodigy as well as making her the special person selected for a certain mission,  the crabby character that feels he got the short end of the stick and isn't thrilled about helping at first, the wise character(in this case a robot posing as a little girl) who knows more about what's going on, but won't tell very much until the very end, and the main villain who knows about the end of the world and feels that mankind should be held responsible for it.

This movie moves at a plodding snails pace and boasts both atrocious acting and a painfully bad script.  For example,  George Clooney was sadly not putting in any semblance of a good performance and didn't seem to have his heart in it.

The characters were all grating-on-the-nerves annoying.  Franklin(Clooney) was too crabby and too intense, Casey was too stubborn and at times quite abrasive, Athena was very stubborn and had an annoying cockney British accent to the point where it was cumbersome to understand what she was saying much of the time, also she was pushy and not very helpful in general,  the evil robots were all ridiculous making them come off like Matrix villain clones.  Making the deadly robots out as stereotypes also kind of brings the movie Westworld to mind.

The violence went too far for a Disney movie.  I mean what-with the evil robots at the store trying to blow Casey's head off with their ray guns, the martial arts that Athena uses to fight the robots during some Matrix rip-off senes, the way that Casey fights off a robot and hits him mercilessly with a bat,  in one scene Athena even gets hit by a car. Robots shoot some cops mercilessly, and the main villain has a big machine land on his legs. I get that they're robots and all but just the idea of people(even if they are robots only appearing to be humans) doing that stuff to one another is bad for children to be seeing but is also inappropriate for a Disney movie.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good action flick and am not opposed to violence in action, but for a Disney movie it's neither the time nor the place to get too rough.

 I hated how they felt it necessary for some reason to have one of the characters preach to the audience about how we should be more focused on finding a solution to our imperfect world instead of embracing violence and destruction in things like action movies and video games for example.  For what's it's worth once a movie gets preachy, that just too much to bear.  I come to be entertained and I doubt that I'm alone here.

They throw in the whole Cape Canaveral space station closing sub-plot only to do nothing with it later on.  Why was it even in the movie?  Also, it didn't make any sense how some of the robots blow up when they've become incapacitated and others don't.  They element just felt like an attempt to steal from Predator.  Also the action wasn't that exciting either.

Overall this movie is nothing more than an attempt at something that just doesn't succeed at its attempts.  Rather than take the time to come up with something fresh, original, and in general devoid of any derivations, Disney just makes this highly derivative piece of garbage without really putting any real thought into it.  In closing,there's nothing to recommend this movie at all and it's really not appropriate for children under 13.",1438214400,22,5762,4.576023391812866

Mr. Clooney finally starts his story about a young and inventive boy named Frank Walker. The time is 1964 and Frank arrives at New York City for an invention contest. There he meets a mysterious girl named Athena, who gives him a T-shaped pin.

The pin has a special power which I would rather not talk about. After following the story of Frank for a while, the film suddenly starts another story, about a girl Casey Newton living in 2014. She also gets the same pin, which does what it does, and Casey embarks on an adventurous journey to Tomorrowland.

The film suffers not only from its confusing narrative, but from the cardboard characters whose only function is to irritate us. Casey keeps asking questions, but never listens quietly to what people have to say. George Clooney plays a tired and disillusioned character in a very boring way. Hugh Laurie plays David Nix, a one-dimensional character who is only interested in delivering some cynical lines. And they are not very amusing.

One shocking thing about Tomorrowland is that the film is directed by Brad Bird best known for his films such as The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol. His latest film needs everything that has made his films in the past such a great one: better (and less preachy) story, better pace, and most of all, better characters we all can identify with.",1436745600,4,1774,4.746753246753247

7129627,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Disney, with only a handful of notable exceptions, (THE BLACK HOLE; 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, and WALL-E chief among them), has not really gone whole hog into the science fiction genre all that much in its history.  But with the 60th anniversary of the opening of Disneyland in Anaheim (an event that took place in July 1955) in mind, they went ahead and made TOMORROWLAND, a cinematic, special effects-laden expansion of what is perhaps the most popular section of that park.

In doing this kind of film, which asks us to imagine and subsequently make a better world out of one that seems rapidly heading towards apocalypse, the films director Brad Bird (RATATOUILLE; MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL) has taken what must seem like a radical approach for what we normally think of as Disney fare.  In it, George Clooney portrays a cynical grumpy inventor whose idea of a jet pack, which he built when he was a kid, bombed at the 1964 Worlds Fair in New York, who encounters an extremely inquisitive and adamantly optimistic teen (Britt Robertson), and subsequently takes her and a robot child named Athena (newcomer Raffey Cassidy) on a journey to change a future that is rapidly going downhill in all the many ways people in the late 20th century had warned about.  The subsequent journey is filled with a lot of peril, some of it fairly hair-raising (even for a PG-rated Disney film), and a lot of twists, turns, and ponderings of space-time continuum that we saw in the 2014 sci-fi epic INTERSTELLAR, and which would make visionaries like Arthur C. Clarke, Rod Serling, and Ray Bradbury beam with pride in the Great Beyond they occupy.  Hugh Laurie, known for his extremely caustic role on the Fox hit show House M.D., portrays the sinister Nix, who nevertheless gives the admonishment that a bleak future is always preventableif there were only more young people like Robertson (and her NASA engineer father, played by country music star Tim McGraw) to make it happen.

The lengths that this movie goes are so outside of what we think of as traditional Disney convention.  Occasionally, it is a touch preachy, but nevertheless very fantastic, and willing to bend the Disney narrative for the sake of futuristic cinematic storytelling that might otherwise have been left to a Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg.  Bird, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Damon Lindelof (the two also co-authored the story with Jeff Jensen), really does a great deal of mixing science fiction and fantasy with typical Disney charm.  In short, even if TOMORROWLAND is in some ways a plug for its flagship theme park on its 60th anniversary, it doesnt flag too much during its 130 minute running time.",1436140800,6,2695,4.892543859649122

Give me a T pin now!",1435536000,6,341,4.896551724137931
7129629,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"Brad Bird's ""Tomorrowland"" is a big fun, hectic mess of a ride. What begins in an extremely promising manner suffers from a few key problems before almost redeeming itself with an almost too-overt call to action. In the hands of a less-accomplished director, ""Tomorrowland"" would qualify as a great summer blockbuster. But Bird has done better - the director behind ""The Iron Giant"", ""The Incredibles"" and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" should have been able to get around the few pesky problems and tell a completely flawless story. Tomorrowland should have been great.

It is difficult to discuss much of this sci-fi adventure in any detail without spoiling some things. I will do my best to keep the damage to a minimum.

Casey (Britt Robertson, ""The Longest Ride"" (playing younger here, I hope)), TV's ""Under the Dome"") is a smart, inquisitive teenager living in Florida with her dad (Tim McGraw), an aerospace engineer about to be unemployed as they are dismantling all of the NASA launch platforms, and her younger brother (Pierce Gagnon, TV's ""Extant""). In an effort to prolong the inevitable, Casey visits the platform at night and conducts sabotage, trying to slow things down. One night, she is arrested. The next morning, when she is released, there is a strange pin among her belongings, a pin with a large T in the middle. When she touches it, she is transported to a field of wheat, Tomorrowland in the distance. She eventually learns Athena (Raffey Cassidy, Masterpiece's ""Mr. Selfridge""), a recruiter for Tomorrowland, has given her the pin, a ticket, of sorts, to enter the new realm and to bring some outstanding ability -  science, math, arts, philosophy -  to the collective group trying to save the World. But they need Frank (George Clooney) to get back to the other side. Frank, once a promising new recruit himself, was banished from the land and now monitors the chaos engulfing the world - famine, extreme weather, violence, destruction. He is reluctant to help them until he sees a little spark of what Casey might be able to do. The trick will be to get Nix (Hugh Laurie), the man in charge of Tomorrowland, to see it as well.

There is a lot going on in ""Tomorrowland"", making it pretty complex and detailed for a summer blockbuster. This is a good thing, for most of the film, but it presents a problem late in the narrative.

It is interesting to watch Casey use her smarts to try to help her dad keep his job. This is a smart young girl, someone with vision and intelligence and a sense of adventure, all three of which will help her either change the world or get her into trouble. Initially, the combination seems to be destined to get her into trouble. She is caught, arrested and spends a few hours in jail until her dad arranges bail. But her dad is pissed off after she is released from jail, focusing on the negative aspects of that, not really listening to or interested in her discovery of Tomorrowland or about the pin.

Britt Robertson is an earnest young actress, pretty, but not remarkable. She is completely fine in this role, but she doesn't really make it more memorable with her presence. It is a shame, because in the television work she has done, she always stands out. Here, and based on the box office of ""The Longest Ride"", she doesn't seem to cut through, to make an impact. It seems like she is a high school star who fails to make an impression in the bigger college group.

Once she gets the pin, some quick internet searches lead her to go on a road trip. This gives Casey and Athena an opportunity to spend some quality time together. Athena is a recruiter for the group at Tomorrowland, searching for individuals with unique and exemplary skills. Athena sees something in Casey and gives her a pin. But sensing Casey is going to get into trouble, Athena takes a more hands-on approach in guiding Casey to the right spot.

Raffey Cassidy is an interesting young actress. Her performance comes off as just strange  I get that she is supposed to be slightly robotic and stiff, but she is also artificially cheery throughout, which doesnt marry well with the robotic nature of her character.

Basically, this bit of the story gives the film it's most Disney-esque bits, providing modern updates on live action Disney films like ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" and ""The Baker Street Irregulars"". Disney films need to appeal to all segments of the audience, so they usually have bits aimed directly at the kids and parts of the story the adults will like. When the studio gets this mix right, it usually results in a classic. It isn't quite right here. In ""Tomorrowland"", a large part of the second act depicts Casey and Athena driving a long distance to get to Frank. During this period, the two interact and share an adventure, but it feels too much like an episode of a Disney Channel show. And the weakness of each performance combined simply cant hold the attention of the adults.

Once they get to Frank, the story becomes more balanced, and special, and feels like a movie you should be paying $20 a ticket for. Yes, $20 if you go to a full price show at one of the new extreme cinemas. But I won't get started on how the cinemas are now charging more for what used to be pretty standard, before they started blanketing the world with small shoebox screens and multi-screen multiplexes. Now, in an effort to make more money, they are creating theaters with huge screens, comfortable seats and great sound. And charging more for it.

Clooney is good, playing the cantankerous Frank. With every word and gesture, you get a feeling for his disappointment. Once a member of the team in Tomorrowland, he was exiled and has spent the majority of his life monitoring everything that goes wrong around the globe, basically watching all of the things he might have been able to prevent happen.

When Casey and Athena show up, he is skeptical  he has had a bad experience trying to fix this problem, and takes some convincing. Some henchmen show up at his safe house and Frank enacts all of the failsafe measures he has in place, leading to a pretty fast-paced and spectacular battle and display of technical wizardry.

It is also at this point that the special effects begin to play an important aspect of the story, bombarding us with some great visual work. All of the special effects are really flawless and help to create this imagined land.

But there is a big problem with the narrative. Everything seems to be building up and the pay off seems rushed. It feels like a significant portion of the film was cut out, or that they decided they couldn't afford it. Something happened, because the effect of this is that it seems a bit slap-dash. It is jarring and doesn't leave a good impression.

Then, there is there is the problem of what happens once everyone arrives in Tomorrowland and confronts Nix.

Hugh Laurie plays Nix. As the architect of Tomorrowland, and everything it is meant to do, he could easily be a one-note character. While he isn't a lot more complex than that, Laurie does add some touches throughout making him a little more interesting.

Also, the message of the film, as important as it is, is too overt. My main complaint about Spike Lee or Oliver Stone films is that they aren't subtle. For each film, the filmmaker has a message they want to get across and they beat you over the head with it. Get it? Get it? Until the experience is less than enjoyable. It makes watching their films a bit like sitting in a classroom, listening to  a teacher lecture on a subject. And that teacher is not interested in a differing opinion. No way.

Many filmmakers successfully incorporate messages into their films - Sidney Lumet immediately comes to mind - +while still telling entertaining stories. ""Tomorrowland"" just skirts the line - it is blatant enough to stick out and announce itself, but it doesn't completely derail the enjoyment of the rest of the film.

I don't usually read other reviews before I write my opinion - I don't want to be influenced by other writers - but I saw a brief excerpt from Richard Roeper's review. He really criticized the film's message, mostly because it had a message at all. It is an important message and to disregard it completely out of hand is doing a disservice to everyone.

Brad Bird is the director of a handful of great films and one less-than-stellar entry does not make him a bad director. It is a small misstep and I can't wait to see what comes next from the mind of this talented visionary.",1435536000,5,8521,4.665333333333334
7129630,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"Believe it; its true, you know!

There is nothing more wonderful than watching something that ties the past, present, and even alludes to the future into one neat little package! What fun! If you went online to watch all of the previews available, then went to other sources (also online), then you have a fairly good grip on what happens throughout this movie. There are a couple of things that going online cannot do for you, most of which has everything in the world to do with a full movie experience. The music, the acting, the production, special effects; all are completely top shelf!

Having been Frank Walker's age when I actually went to the 1964 New York World's Fair I can honestly say that I missed the part of the ride through Disneys Small World exhibit where the bottom drops out and I get to go to Tomorrowland! A total bummer! That would've been sweet beyond comprehension! Imagine everyone looking for me, wondering what happened. More to the point, how would life be different, . . . better?

Comparing Tomorrowland to James Hiltons Lost Horizon might be appropriate as long as you go for the movie version. The original book doesnt end as well. Maybe that is the real message of the times, with people on a seemingly unerring path to self-destruction with no understanding of the why? behind it. Maybe the new message is that we can make a very positive difference, that we can believe that . . . even the teeniest action can change the future.

  I'm not going to try to explain the plot. because it comes in shiftings of developing emotional awareness, opposed by robotic and ""android"" near -humanness, during a movie-long continuing attempt at political and technological control of the human imagination and heart.

7129636,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"George Clooney and two youths struggle to bring about the ideals and benefits from an other worldly fantasy dimension zone over to the real one in ""Tomorrowland"".

Very nice movie with a good moral tone that life & the future many times is what you put into it.  Do you feed the bad wolf or the good wolf?  Everything, including the better world of ""Tomorrowland"" is all up to you & those special bright, honest, caring, and compassionate young souls of America and the world who care.

Walt Disney had the right message, ""There is a great new wonderful tomorrow..."" But only if we here in America & in other places across the globe embrace that message and strive for one.

 The character ""Athena"" is played very well, displaying an interesting and spunky youth who has advanced technological knowledge on top of being an awesome ""martial arts"" combative adventurer trying to aid Clooney and a teenage girl.

 I would have rated this movie G, if it wasn't for some violent action sequences (which I found to be among the best scenes of the film) where a crew of evil androids attack Clooney and company in a house rigged with defense high tech booby traps.  Clooney and his friends escape, returning to the magical place themed on Walt Disney World's ""Tomorrowland"" theme park.

We have an introductory scene I really appreciated where a younger version of Clooney first finds the early 1960's Disneyland, and is greeted by the Athena character along with an English themed bureaucrat of the park.  You the audience feel as if you are in the early 60's.

 Many scenes and plot themes of this film may go right over the heads of most children, along with some adults. The film has some marvelous computer animated scenes along with pretty art depictions with some dynamic characters, but over all the plot and interwoven message might not carry well among modern movie goers, because the average American adult might not be able to contemplate the totality of the movie (but hopefully some children and teenagers just might).  (-:

One element of the movie asks us, since it has been many years since the glory days of 1960 America, with many brutal and dark occurrences happening in both America and around the world all of those decades from that time period to the 21st century world of today; we ask why hasn't Walt and his staff's vision of ""Tomorrowland"" ever come to pass? What has happened to our dreams & those lofty ideals? Is ""Tomorrowland"" too late for society?  Is the world as we know it doomed?

 This movie answers the question by stating many times ""Tomorrowland"" is what we the folks make it out to be, if we stay positive and have the right ideals and goals then a better outcome will become of it.  Everything is up to us, and if some one wants a nicer ""Tomorrowland"" to come to pass, they have to make it happen, because no one will do it for them.

Apparently the outcome of this film has impacted the production of the ""Tron"" franchise, which is a real shame and a huge mistake on Disney's behalf because this movie has nothing to do with ""Tron"" or the success of another sequel.  This film is a work of art all of it's own.

 I give this movie a B and thumbs up.",1433894400,11,3186,4.570422535211268
7129637,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Everything I heard about this movie was good. But when I went to see it I didn't realize it would be THAT good. What a tremendous surprise.

Here's the scoop. Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is well beyond bright and is using her smarts to delay the dismantling of a rocket launch platform so her NASA engineer dad won't lose his job. The plan backfires and, as she is bailed out of jail she finds herself in possession of a pin that transports her to the future. Her trip there puts her in contact with Frank Walker (George Clooney) and the two find themselves on a mission to save the future.

This movie was one surprise after another. From script to finished product it simply blew me away. This IS a cautionary tale, and the end is a bit (maybe more than a bit) on the preachy side, but that aside, it is still a wild ride. I liked all the characters and Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy, as Athena, light up the screen. They just seemed to get it. It helps that the lines they got to deliver were good. Writer/director Brad Bird already has a formidable resume and his imagination was working overtime here. I never knew what to expect. The script is almost overly imaginative. The effects are no less so. It was just one cool thing after another. Pauline Kael noted of ""Star Wars"" that it was like a box of Cracker Jack filled with nothing but prizes. That's almost the case here. Bird just kept slinging great stuff at the viewer with both hands. I loved it.

Athena who is a human robot then places her pin with Casey's lost, and found items on purpose because Athena thinks Casey can save Tomorrowland. The Tomorrowland pin is gold with capital T in blue letters. Whenever Casey touches the pin, it transports her to Tomorrowland. Tomorrowland takes place in the earlier days. She has to do it in an open space, otherwise she won't get far. A bit Disney humor. Her father Eddie Newton (Tim McGraw), doesn't understand what the pin is all about, and hides it from Casey.

Casey tells her brother Nate Newton (Pierce Gagnon) that she thinks she sees the future. She lies to her father that she is going camping with friends.

But, the good news is, beings like Athena came to life within that best of all possible worlds. Not just a wonderful character, the child actress conveyed her with charm and aplomb. Whatever the movie's failings, and there are a good few, they don't weigh on her shoulders.

7129647,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"This was an unusual movie experience for me,  because I found the concept far more intriguing than the execution. Other reviewers have described the plot thoroughly, so I will focus on the movie's message.
There can be no mistaking the message, as it is rather clunkily laid out in a lengthy monologue in the third act: envisioning dystopian futures pre-programs us to accept the worst version of our own future. This is a bold strike against Hunger Games, Divergent, World War Z and movies of this type. The director is telling the audience that we must imagine a better future in order to achieve a better future. I feel this is a very positive and uplifting message, especially for children. It's also a brave stance against a very popular genre. Walt himself was a great believer is envisioning a utopian society, and he went so far as to buy land to create an actual city based on his ideals for the future.
The only other comment I have to add is that I feel other reviewers have downplayed just how terrible George Clooney is in this movie. He had a chance to create a very memorable character, but instead he seems mentally absent. If I was the director, I would ask him for my money back. Sorry, Clooney fans : )",1433203200,4,1221,4.524886877828054
7129648,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"I found this movie to be rather difficult to relate to, but overall, I think that one can see it as expressive of time, of our sense of hope or despair for the future, and of imagination.  The childlike enthusiasm and wonder of the main character seen initially as young, has turned to something akin to despair now that he is beyond his youth.  The movie is about struggling with that sense of desperation that comes as enthusiasm gave way to cynicism.  In the end, a sense of hope is recaptured.  One has too a sense of how time can affect us, as we make choices to feed our sense of despair or of hope.  I was impressed by the gulf that separates the young from the old, and of how fragile our lives are as time carries us all too swiftly from youth to old age.",1433116800,2,764,4.170068027210885
7129649,5,B00WAJ8RBI,"The first time with my wife and 11 year old I came out saying crankily 'geeze didn't they learn from the narration in Blade Runner..."" and my son said ""no that was needed!  it makes the ending...""  The second time I came out saying ""ooooooh!""  the 3rd time I took the Executive Director of the Space Studies Institute, on the way in I said, 'this is a great boy movie'  on the way out she said 'that was a great Strong Girl movie"" - and, ""that's not what I heard it was.""

I work in a business related to Futures of Humans.  I get cranky over the losses... but try very hard to do whatever I can to stay on the positive side in my presentations and day to day work. This movie is a boost for me.

I've seen mostly white haired people in the seats but nearly as many 9 to 12 years old,  not nearly as many young teens and 20-30s as such a story should have attracted but it being a Disney I guess that makes some sense (we all look back with pride on our seeing TRON in the theaters when it came out, but being 'all grown up and worldly now', things from the MouseHouse aren't cool to be seen watching).

The ""message"" was clear the first time, each time after the flow of *the movie itself* smoothed and I saw that this didn't fit ANY of the reviews I had read.

In the second week I texted a Professor at a Midwest university, told him to go see it.  He said he hadn't even heard of it.  His business is futures of engineers and his passion is anthropology with a focus on how cutting edge science and technology affects humans. He hadn't even heard of it.

I texted an administrator of an east coast prep school that seeks out bright but underprivileged kids to give them a positive head start - She and her staff ARE Athenas.  She hadn't heard of it.

I hazard an un-researched speculation that all the billboards and busses in Clooney's Studio City neighborhood and over where the execs drive to work in Burbank aren't exactly representative of the spend done elsewhere in the country.

I lamented that Disney again had lost sight of something.  A couple of days before release, I had taken my son to the preview at Disneyland and right across from the theater the Hall Of Innovation was closed because they were turning it into a new Avengers thing.  Great timing,  Walt would have been proud (ugh).  If anyone actually knew about the movie and got excited then went to Anaheim for some Tomorrowland in Tomorrowland they should be prepared to now get a fantasy of the Earth being saved only by non-normal special beings, while us normal humans sit and cower.

Great scheduling, Disney.

Yesterday I spoke with a guy who had worked previously with the Director.  He explained to me that while he thought the man was an Absolute Genius, this time the lack of marketing wasn't all on the studio alone.  I get the director's point... but you really should have thought to find some way to get people into the seats.

I'm a busy person but I am hoping to see this another one or two times before it quietly fades from the theaters.  I have preordered the blueray and await it's shipping...I know that even on our big screen TVs it won't be as amazing as on a giant IMAX screen but still I must have it. I have also bought the Audible ""Juvenile"" novel and halfway through I find it very good now because I can fit the story to the images.  ""Juvenile"" is not ""baby"", if you recall that Heinlein's Podkayne of Mars and The Rolling Stones and Have Spacesuit are all called his ""Juveniles"" (btw: the reader of the Audible version of Tomorrowland comes close to the reader of Podkayne, so if you liked that one you may want to check out this one.)

If you missed it in the theater, sit close to your biggest screen and let this one wash over you.  It is a lot of fun, but it is not kiddie minions and unicorns or pratfall drunk pirates.  It is great.  I wish someone on Buena Vista had pushed a bit harder to get the word out for it, but perhaps that rolls into the Full Experience - not everyone is suited for Tomorrowland, but those who are will be found by this movie.",1433116800,56,4065,4.302233902759527
7129650,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"I was really excited when Brad Bird announced that the next film he would be working on would be none other than a sequel to The Incredibles. Critics have not been too kind to this movie; which admittedly had me skeptical about seeing it. Nonetheless, I did finally get to see it  and today, I give my review on the movie Tomorrowland.

Young but bright Frank Walker is on his way to the Hall of Inventions to demonstrate a jetpack that he built. Upon meeting David Nix, Frank informs David that his jetpack does not exactly work; all the while capturing the interest of a young girl Athena. Later, Athena gives Frank a strange pin-a pin that sends Frank to a place of his wildest dreams.

Starring as Frank Walker, George Clooney gives Tomorrowland a likable performance alongside Britt Robertson who portrays the main character Casey. I found myself really enjoying Raffey Cassidy's outing as the character Athena due to how well she played the character. Tim McGraw plays Casey's father Eddie in a supporting role, and actor Hugh Laurie stars as David Nix.

Tomorrowland's story is easy to follow, as it has action, comedy, science fiction, and adventure. Visually, the movie is gorgeous to look at and I like the movie's soundscape as a whole. There are times in the 3rd act of the film where the plot gets a bit muddled, but I still was able to enjoy the movie nonetheless. Surprisingly, Tomorrowland has a bit more profane words than the average PG movie does, which may or may not bother parents. I do not consider this movie to be a highlight or Disney masterpiece, but I will say that Tomorrowland is a good outing due to the actors/actress involved, the likable story, and the visual art of the film. Tomorrowland is:

Not so sure why I've seen such low reviews for this film. In brief, I think the acting is good, the cinematography is on par, the plot is interesting, too, though I can see where it could have been more developed (but it seems that is of little consequence in the grand scheme of things), and the actors themselves are awesome.

Most reviews of this film avoid talking about the plot, as most adults don't know exactly what is going on as the story is a bit confused, especially when tachyon time travel viewing is involved. Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) a bright teen girl who likes science (no talking ""math is hard"" Barbies allowed). She gets it and cares. She is inundated with the doom and gloom messages of global disaster and wants to ""fix it"" unlike most of the apathetic planet who want to market the concept. She meets Athena (Raffey Cassidy) a time and dimension traveling android who has her team with inventor Frank Walker (George Clooney) to save the world.

The film could be said to have a liberal bias, but blames humanity as a whole for not acting, without specifically mentioning climate deniers. It was apparent who they were talking about without mentioning their name.

George Clooney is great, Hugh Laurie is a very underplayed villain, Britt Robertson is smart and sassy, and Raffey Cassidy carries a very adult-sounding role as Athena. The scene in the Sci-Fi souvenir shop, with its instantly recognizable artifacts for all truly SF fans is hilarious. This may be considered a YA film but it does have some cursing per Clooney.

The effects are spectacular. There's humor, adventure, but a message that really could've been left out because we all know it, so why bother?",1432944000,3,625,4.621621621621622

The only good thing was the Eiffel Tower event but it was not enough to save the movie.

7129657,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) from a screenplay by Bird and Damon Lindelof (Lost, World War Z, Star Trek Into Darkness), Tomorrowland is something of a mixed bag.  The first half of the movie absolutely soars with an ever-mounting sense of wonder and adventure, but then it stumbles and nearly falls under clumsy explanations and a heavy-handed message.  It does salvage some of the earlier feeling towards the very end, but it's not enough to make up for the long wrong turn things seemed to take in the second half.

The film begins with a man named Frank Walker (George Clooney) talking to the screen as if either making a recording or perhaps talking to an audience we cannot see.  He keeps getting interrupted by a girl's voice from off-screen, telling him how he _should_ be telling the story and suggesting that he start at the beginning.

Things then flash back to the 1964 World's Fair in New York where we see a 12-year-old Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) carrying around an invention - a prototype jetpack he's made from vacuum cleaner parts - that he hopes will impress one of the fair's sponsors, David Nix (Hugh Laurie). Nix is unimpressed and dismisses Frank's efforts as impractical. A young girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) however, is impressed by young Frank's creativity and gives him an embossed pin with a large ""T"" on it, telling him to follow her when she departs with Nix on one of the fair's rides. Curious, Frank sneaks onto the ride behind Nix's party, is surprised when his pin is suddenly scanned and is even more surprised when the ride then mysteriously transports him from 1964 New York to a futuristic place called Tomorrowland. To say more of this scene would be a spoiler, other than to mention that Tomorrowland is truly a place of wonder.

Flash forward to our present, where we meet Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), a tech-savvy and enterprising young girl who lives with her NASA engineer father Eddie Newton (Tim McGraw) and younger brother Nate (Pierce Gagnon) in Cape Canaveral, Florida.  Her father, however, is soon to be unemployed once the deconstruction crews finish dismantling NASA's last remaining launch station.  Determined not to let this happen, Casey sneaks out at night and uses her knowledge and skills to sabotage the work cranes at the site to put off the day of reckoning. One night however she is caught in the act and arrested. Upon her release the next morning, Casey's stuff is returned to her, along with a pin she's never seen before but we have: the embossed pin with the big ""T"". When she picks it up though, suddenly everything around her changes and she finds herself in an open field outside of Tomorrowland.  This much you would have learned from the movie's trailers, but what comes next you'll have to see for yourself. And it's really worth seeing.

It doesn't give away anything to say that Casey ends up tracking down the now-adult Frank in her quest of finding Tomorrowland. And that once she finds him, things really kick into high gear in a big way.

As someone old enough to remember both Disneyland's original Tomorrowland and the 1964 New York World's Fair, the thing that moved me the most about this film was how much it captured the feel of the time, the atmosphere of excitement, a sense of boundless optimism combined with a firm belief that the future was going to be a wondrous place where anything would be possible, and that science and technology would take us there. It was a time of great excitement: the space program was at its height, a man walked on the moon, polio was being eliminated, the heart transplant was achieved.  Anything and everything seemed not only possible but achievable.  Tomorrowland recreates that spirit wonderfully.

One thing I particularly liked was a scene where Casey goes to a scifi & pop-culture memorabilia shop called Blast From the Past which is a visual feast and treasure trove of scifi references in general and self-references to the film's various contributors. This is the sort of thing you really want the DVD for so that you can watch it again and again and try to catch or spot all of them (there are dozens).  You know from the beginning that the writers are having fun when the proprietors (played by Keegan-Michael Key and Kathryn Hahn) introduce themselves as Hugo Gernsback (legendary writer, editor and publisher regarded as ""the Father of Science Fiction) and Ursula (for Ursula K. Leguin, legendary scifi author and winner of two ""Hugo"" awards).

The music score by Michael Giacchino (Up, Ratatouille, Star Trek Into Darkness) is very nicely done and really adds to the sense of wonder and discovery that permeates the best parts of the film. The cinematography by Claudio Miranda (Life of Pi, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) is nothing less than spectacular, managing to convincingly capture and convey the look and feel of everything from the 1964 New York World's Fair and current day Florida to the imagined futuristic Tomorrowland.

The thing that keeps Tomorrowland from being the film it could have been is when it starts trying to explain everything in the second half of the film.  The explanations are clumsy and have a forced feel to them, and actually end up raising more questions than they answer as well as creating plot-holes that undermine a lot of what was built up in the first half.  And then there's 'The Message' that is so thick and heavy it feels like it's being laid on with a cement mixer. The less said about any of this the better - I only mention it as a caution of what to expect from the film as a whole.  To its credit, Tomorrowland does make something of a comeback at the end, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.  I only wish that Bird and Lindelof had trusted their instincts - and their audience - more and simply let the film speak for itself.

Recommended for the first half, which if you're lucky, will be what stays with you after the film is done.",1432857600,6,5973,4.723076923076923

A headstrong teenage science enthusiast (Britt Robertson) teams up with a bitter inventor (George Clooney) to re-enter a trans-dimensional utopia and save the world from destruction.

What did I think?

Director Brad Bird has made dazzlingly fun movies such as The Incredibles and Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol, and while Tomorrowland isn't as good as his past work, its definitely in the same spirit. The visuals are very creative, and the main characters are endearing, with Robertson being an especially lively presence. The plot (co-written with Lost and Prometheus writer Damon Lindelof) is a bit hard to follow and sort of unsatisfying, but its still charming enough to be worth the ride.",1432857600,,717,5.2631578947368425
7129659,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"My wife and watched this film in the theatre, I thoroughly enjoyed it as it regards the characters, and the vision of Tomorrowland.  I found it interesting ... once.  The message can be a little overbearing; most certainly, not as overwhelming as the message in Avatar.  It was like listening to a version of Al Gore.  I do like the fact that it showed that one needs to think out of the box, but some of those out of the box activities can be dangerous and illegal  (think very mild type of ecoterrorist).

So is this a good film?  I give it a B to B+, but it is not anywhere close to being an A film.

Which brings up the point: the BluRay is ~$40.00, and even with the Amazon discount, it is still $35.00.  I would purchase the disc for my library, but it is way too costly for the overall quality of the film.  If and when the disc goes below $20 will I consider its purchase.",1432857600,2,880,4.123529411764705
7129660,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"There's a moment in ""Tomorrowland"" where grown-up cynic Frank Walker (George Clooney) pops the optimistic bubble of his spunky sidekick Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) by explaining that the virtual reality simulation of a utopian techno-future she witnessed is actually just a commercial -- it's a sanitized version of the much grittier real thing. It's a meta statement that could just as easily apply to the movie itself.

At heart, director Brad Bird wants you to know that somewhere along the way Americans stopped dreaming. The central conceit of the film was inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson's ""We Stopped Dreaming."" Tyson's argument is that the defunding of NASA is the destruction of our dreams, paralleled in the film by Casey's battle to keep her Cape Canaveral from being taken apart by sabotaging the cranes.

The film educates us on how Disneyland and Disney World's are descendants of World's Fairs -- both ""It's a Small World"" and the ""Carousel of Progress"" debuted at the 1960s World's Fair first, with Epcot being perhaps the best realization of the Fairs' dreams of international peace. In a flashback that kicks of the film with a bang, a younger more idealistic Frank (Thomas Robinson) lugs his homemade jetpack to an inventor competition at the ""Carousel of Progress.""  Frank is sharply rejected by David Nix (Hugh Laurie), but then a perky British pixie named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) gives Frank a pin that turns the ""It's a Small World"" ride into a dimension hopping gate to Tomorrowland itself.

Daniel H. Wilson's book, Where's My Jetpack? perfectly sums up the disappointment so many of us have in the future we were promised but was never realized, and ""Tomorrowland"" dives right into the topic by having young Frank's jetpack be the key to his future survival. But there's a darker plot here that lurks in the background: who, exactly, promised us this future?

It was NASA and the press, bolstered by a public willing to believe. The Astronaut's Wives Club by Lily Koppel (soon to be a TV show on ABC) demonstrates how the press lapped up everything NASA gave them and in turn covered up all the flaws that made astronauts human beings -- including their wives. To justify the enormous cost of NASA's space race against the Russians, the technology had to be literally brought down to Earth. So jet packs weren't just for astronauts, they were for businessmen trying to get to work. Convenient food dispensers weren't just for astronauts, the harried housewife could use it to make her dinner in no time flat. Your tax dollars at work!

Bird and co-writer Damon Lindedlof try to play the idealism straight, but their adult cynicism can't resist turning the plot into something ripped from a Terminator movie in which androids tear each other's heads off and vaporize police officers. If you're bringing young children, be warned -- ""Tomorrowland"" harbors kids' ideas in a decidedly adult film.

SPOILERLAND: This dichotomy is best summed up in Frank and Athena's relationship, .which is pure when they're kids and borderline squicky when it's an adult Frank trying desperately to not talk about the fact he's in love with a preteen girl robot. ""Tomorrowland"" spirals from there into Illuminati-style cabals, the Eiffel Tower, dubious science (drinking a Coke restores blood sugar you guys!), and more bad guy murdering. This has to be the most muderer-iest Disney movie about idealism to date.

My kids weren't phased by the violence; my son was more concerned about how much trouble Casey would get into with her soon-to-be-laid-off NASA engineer dad (Tim McGraw). Tomorrowland's argument amounts to a Tinkerbell-style ""we just all need to believe"" argument cloaked in science and wonder, which left me feeling a little flat. As GE's ""Invention Donkey"" commercial explains when a millennial makes a wish to power the planet:

""First, start planning this years ago. Build a massive network of think tanks, research and testing facilities. Hire brilliant people from all different arts and sciences. Pile on the PhDs. Turn garbage into power. Run cities on jet engine technology. And oh yeah, create data-crunching windmills from the future.  And then...POOF! It's done!""

As the donkey says, it ain't that simple folks.

Tomorrowland"" threatens the apocalypse if we don' figure it out. And yet despite the reductive argument the last few minutes of the movie are the very best. Finally we get a glimpse of the future as it is: practical applications, not world-spanning; implemented by the will of the people, not the government selling us on it; happening now, not futuristic promises decades hence. It's almost enough to make you believe there's hope for the future...but not enough to make up for the torturous path ""Tomorrowland"" takes to get us there.",1432857600,16,4784,5.0494296577946765
7129661,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"The movie started out with the girl Casey quite bitchy and quibbling with George Clooney.  And then the movie kept on feeding the ego of the audience that she is the smartest girl and she is the chosen one and she is the only one that can save the world.  And the movie has to show that her dad, who was a NASA engineer, was puzzling about some electronic gadget he was building, and looking at it for less than one second, Casey changed the connector from one point to another point and the whole thing all of a sudden worked.  This is all pure science fictions to me, as I see girls like Casey nowadays, they are not so smart at all, and the smartest things they know is how to manipulate guys and how to psychologically manipulate people, say, when they are a salesperson, making you look like a social misfit when you look at something for a minute and then not buy it.

There is also a point in the movie where she just throw an apple to her dad, quite unexpectedly, and say with a commanding tone, ""Eat"".  What if it is a wife throwing an apple to the husband and say in a commanding tone, ""Eat""?  I would think it is not very respectful, not to mention it is the daughter doing this to her dad. I actually do feel this is somewhat bitchy behavior, and I don't see such behaviors in movies in the 80s and 90s.  Maybe time have changed, but I also wonder why Hollywood would make bitchy behaviors look so cool, and make more girls behave this way.

And then, the movie is saying that people affect the world too much, use too much brute-force towards the world.  And then Casey and George Clooney both use brute-force against their opponents, destroying, bombing, whatever, whatever.  And the movie suggests that it is whether you feed the optimistic wolf, or feed the pessimistic wolf that matters.  It looks like BS to me, as I see too many optimistic people whose purpose is to make a lot of profits, fulfill their American dream, making people spend the money on things that they don't need, over spending, creating a lot of waste for the earth, making a lot of junk food, and promoting a lot of junk food to people.  Near the end of the movie, it felt even more like a propaganda, that ""people should have a dream"", and they send the pin to a lot of people, and they are like a bunch of heroes who will save the world.

And yes, there is a part of the movie where they implanted Coca-Cola in it, so that it looked like the cool thing to drink.  So there is junk food promotion, and at the same time they are telling you to save the world.

I don't know, it sounded like they try to feed more ego to people that they can save the world, rather than telling people that they need to be less selfish, and care about one another.  Instead, the movie seems to suggest that you can be bitchy, you can be as egoistic as you want, and since you are so great, you will save the world.

There is a little girl Raffey Cassidy in the movie, and I quite like her character.  She actually looked like a caring person who has a heart, has a conscience, a non-selfish person who actually care about another human being and the world.  She looks very convincing if she is the one saving the world.",1432771200,10,3190,4.269102990033223

7129663,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"I was looking forward to this movie because Tomorrowland seemed like an original story with great homages to Disney history. Im a huge Disney Parks fan and loved the visuals coming out over the last few months.

I went in hoping to like the movie and, through a dearth of plot summaries online, I knew next to nothing about the plot.  I was surprised by the movie, though not in the best ways.

Its not that the movie itself is bad  the visuals are great, the acting is fine, and the originality of the setting is great.  But the story is a pretty ho-hum retread of many plots - from The Wizard of Oz to half of the original series Star Trek episodes to Atlas Shrugged.  And the humor falls flat  George Clooneys usual lighthearted good-guy banter doesnt really fit in with his character, Frank Walker.  But there are some glaring plot/reality holes that I cant seem reconcile.

Without plot spoilers, the movie centers on Casey, the daughter of a soon-to-be laid off NASA employee, whos been sabotaging the demolition efforts at the last shuttle launch pad at Cape Canaveral. When she gets caught, arrested, and released, she finds a Tomorrowland pin has been secreted into her stuff by a young girl named Athena. We met Athena in an earlier flashback to the 1964 Worlds Fair where she helped a boy named Frank sneak off to a fantastical world named Tomorrowland with a similar pin.

Through the film, we find out about Tomorrowland and its importance, what happened to Frank, why Athena apparently doesnt age, and why shes helping people get to Tomorrowland in the first place.

What disappointed:

I found it tedious to get to the point where I started to understand what was going on. Usually in a movie like this, the audience is several steps ahead of the characters and waiting for them to catch up. Tomorrowland has the opposite problem, the characters are taking too long to fill in the audience, in this case represented by Casey since she starts out knowing as little about whats going on as we do. Yet she still manages to catch on to the technology instinctively  a point noted by Frank and important to the story.

Right around the halfway point, I was beginning to regret spending money on the IMAX experience. When Frank tells Casey You were sold a dream. Made to feel like you're part of something special. But you're not I laughed because I thought that summed it up perfectly.

See below for a more detailed set of disappointments  I didn't want to put spoilers in this first part.

What I liked:

The visuals are well done and left me wanting to see (and know more about) the city of Tomorrowland itself. The Disney homages are there but not intrusive or overwhelming. The Paris sequence was great.

Theres a great monologue by Nix (Hugh Laurie), the head of Tomorrowland, about society packaging bad news into video games and movies for entertainment and that society doesnt heed warnings because the path to destruction doesnt require them to do anything today! He was talking about major plot points, but I couldn't help thinking how it could apply to many parts of our society  including this film packaging its message as entertainment for mass consumption

In the end, the story came together and connected the dots in a generally fun way.
Ultimately, this movie seems to be Disneys stab at the YA (young adult) craze  e.g. Harry Potter, Hunger Games, etc. I love to see young women at the center of a film with the message that they can do anything, particularly a science(ish) related movie like Tomorrowland. Fortunately, theres no angst about deciding between two boys and no vampires.

Heres the math on my 3 stars (very minor spoilers in this part):

5 stars (all movies with good trailers start with 5 stars)
 -1 star  for the humor, which I thought falls flat
+1 star  for some great visuals
+1 star  for Disney Parks homages
 -1 star  for not fleshing out the Tomorrowland society more (how does the society function, who does the mundane jobs, does the average
  person even know if our civilization exists, who keeps voting for Nix as the leader?)
+1 star  for no major adult themes  the H-word is used a couple of times and a couple people are killed in violent but not explicit ways (there's also
  some firghtening scenes of devastation including floods, rioting, devastated cities, and nuclear explosions)
-3 stars for the nitpicks I mention in the Spoiler section below
= 3 Stars

Now for a deeper discussion WITH SPOILERS  if you don't want to know any plot points, stop reading now:

The first thing to mention is that, in judging this movie, I understand that its a science fiction adventure and there needs to be some suspension of disbelief to enjoy the film.

I can forgive the comical physical traumas that would cripple or kill in real life.  Things like slamming into the ground in a jet pack or being hurled 20 feet into a wall or to the ground.  Getting up from a trauma and shaking it off is a common adventure movie trait.

I can also forgive the skewed science used to move the plot along where necessary  indeed this is another common sci-fi tactic and is a favorite of Disneys Marvels The Avengers series where anything can happen at any time with some made up science when needed to serve the plot.

Now the storyline for reference purposes (remember, youve been warned that were in SPOILER territory here):

Tomorrowland (a city on another planet) was set up by Jules Verne, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison, and Alexandre Eiffel somehow using the Eiffel tower to pick up signals or something like that.  It didn't really make sense, but it didn't have to.

The quartet set up the city on another planet to allow invention and creativity to flourish without the hindrances of money, bureaucracy, etc.

Tomorrowland took to sending audio-animatronic children (their words, not mine) to Earth to select dreamers to come to live in Tomorrowland.  The movie shows this through the robotic children giving pins to the best and brightest of the world who can then virtually visit Tomorrowland for a specified period of time, presumably to decide if they want to stay.  The movie doesnt really say what happens if they don't want to stay.

Anyway, somewhere along the line, Tomorrowland changes and Frank is kicked out for not going along with the program (remember that hed been there since he was a boy).  By the time we see Tomorrowland again in the third act, its run down and rather desolate.

Frank, living on Earth, has become a recluse and obsessed with something bad that is going to happen.  We don't find out until the third act when its explained to Casey, whos the stand-in for the audience in terms of knowledge about whats going on (i.e. we don't know anything until she finds out).

Through various chases and a spectacular rocket launch in the middle of Paris, Frank, Casey, and Athena (one of the audio-animatronic recruiters) finally make it to Tomorrowland.

There, Nix (Tomorrowlands leader played by Hugh Laurie), apparently leading an empty city with a dozen or so soldiers, takes them into custody, explains the movies plot to Casey so were all in on the coming disaster, and proceeds in trying to send them back to Earth.

It seems that younger Frank invented a device that can see possible future events but it turns out the device is inadvertently shaping those events and nudging the Earths civilization toward a rather nasty worldwide collapse.  Frank, Casey, and Athena are trying to stop the machine while Nix does not want to stop the imminent apocalypse.  You see, Nix is angry with Earths civilization because he feels weve been warned about the collapse by everything from global warming to colony collapse disorder in bees, but our horrible capitalistic ways have doomed us to not pay attention.  Hes content that the utopian Tomorrowland will survive and is busy transferring stuff from Earth that he wants to survive (presumably art, I guess.  Its not fully explained.)

In the end, the machine is destroyed by Athena sacrificing herself, Nix is killed, and Tomorrowland starts rebuilding  and recruiting Earths best and brightest again.

My nitpicks:

Horrible parenting 
When we first meet Frank, hes without his family on a bus to the Worlds Fair in New York.  From the fair, hes recruited by Athena to Tomorrowland.  Frank spends years there until he is kicked out.  Was Frank an orphan?  Is the movie positing that many of the missing kids in the world might have met a similar fate?  Again, not explained.

Likewise, when the 16 year old Casey disappears for days to run off to find Frank and get to Tomorrowland, she simply instructs her brother to tell their father that shes gone camping with friends.  Assuming its summer (no school), Caseys still given a lot of leeway by her father considering she had just been released from jail (for sabotaging equipment at a Cape Canaveral demolish site).  The kicker is that when she finally gets back, her father is shown working as usual in his garage workshop, apparently not concerned that his daughter was gone.  Great parenting

Story gaps 
What happened to Tomorrowland by the third act?  When we first see it, its a wonder-filled place with amazing vibrancy and bustling crowds.  In the third act, its desolate and rundown.  Its implied that the place started to get run-down after Frank invented the future-telling machine and Tomorrowland stopped recruiting people from Earth.  But they don't explain why they stopped recruiting.  And why would they need a constant stream of talent from Earth?  A city the size of Tomorrowland has tens or hundreds of thousands of people.  Assuming they started as the best and brightest from Earth, shouldnt their kids be able to keep the city in good shape?  So many questions not explained about how the city functions, where did all the people go, why did they knuckle under to Nix for all that time?

Nix was fine with killing Frank and Casey via his surrogates on Earth.  Why doesnt he just do that in Tomorrowland?  Instead, to serve the plot, he decides to send them back to Earth since its going to be destroyed anyway.

When the machine is destroyed, its ostensibly to give Earth a chance to avoid the devastating future that was imminent.  But then Tomorrowland goes right back to culling Earths future prospects!  Arent they keeping Earth on the same downward trajectory, just at a slower pace?!  The characters kept blaming the machine for putting the idea of the apocalypse in peoples heads, thus creating the downward spiral.  But maybe, just maybe, the fact that Tomorrowland plucked the best among us off the planet for their own purposes is to blame!

The denizens of Tomorrowland are quick to point out Earths problems, but Id like to look at Tomorrowlands issues:

1  They use capital punishment pretty liberally.  Frank is sentenced to death for helping Casey. Casey is sentenced to death just for knowing about Tomorrowland.  Sure, they weren't tried and convicted and you could make the argument that it was just Tomorrowlands corrupt leader, Nix, trying to have them killed.  But who put Nix in charge?  Why was he given so much power and free reign by the people of Tomorrowland?

2  They are playing with forces they clearly don't understand.  Most notably, tachions  one of science fictions favorite plot devices.  Not so bright after all.

3  Their motto is Imagination is more important than knowledge.  Really?  Arent they equal at best?  I can imagine grand buildings, but that same imagination hasn't been able to lift one steel girder

Acting problems:
The acting itself is fine.  Im just not a fan of taking mid-twenty year old actors and having them play high-school age kids. Occasionally, they look the part. But in this film, Casey looks to be about 26 - but flashback videotape stamping and her riding a motorcycle point to her being 16. Why not just use a younger actress, or make the character older?

Maybe some of this will be explained in the Blu-ray extras.  Which brings me to my last note.

This review is being written after seeing the movie in the theater. I do plan to purchase the movie on Blu-ray (with a digital copy) when it comes out and will update this review if warranted.",1432684800,6,12210,4.7567824845311755
7129664,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"I am a little bored.  Wish I had my laptop earlier so I could have written reviews while watching.  Imagine being on a cool Disney ride for 2+hours, but the entire time they are preaching a message of overindulgence, evill corporate practices, etc.  Gets a little tiresome no matter how interesting the ride.

This movie starts with two big characters explaining the situation through a flashback - genius Frank Walker (George Clooney), and genius inventor teen Casey Newton (Britt Robertson).  They are your key characters, along with Nix, the naysayer and doompreacher.

There is a big message here, and that is that Tomorrowland will end, the earth will end, because we are not taking care of the world - glaciers are melting, people dying, etc.

Ultimately, this movie is supposed to be a ride of fantasy, one that reaches deep to the inner child in all of us.  You can't take it seriously, even with the serious message, and it is kind of fun at times, and if you can just suspend belief for a while, you can have some fun with it.  But it is hit or miss throughout.

It is an OK movie, but I didn't get a sense of where everyone came from, how things happened, etc. - lots of problems and unanswered questions, and I was left unsatisfied.",1432684800,30,1244,4.563063063063063
7129665,3,B00WAJ8RBI,"I enjoyed this movie but was expecting more (a lot more). In the beginning they put so much of it in the future but most of it is in the present running from other people.
  What i wanted to see is less running more future, more flying jet packs and other cool flying gizmos like maybe stuff from back from the future and other inventions beyond our imagination.
  For a 2 hour movie I don't think it is a good movie at least in 2d. A lot of the movie is slow but still interesting. I consider this movie a prequel to possible future Tomorrowland movies. I still would recommend this movie  just don't expect a complete W O W factor in this movie.",1432684800,4,647,4.185483870967742
7129666,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"This will probably be the only movie I see in a theater this year, and we did the IMAX version.  It was one of the best mainstream movies I've seen in a while, and one of the best Disney films I can remember---aside from the ""Pirates..."" franchise of course.  The trailers were brilliant as well:  They show enough to give you a feel for what the movie will be about, yet in many of the scenes shown in the trailers, what you think is happening is not what actually happens at that point in the film...  Sadly, we don't get enough time in Tomorrowland, but to say why is the worst sort of spoiler.

It's 1964 when the movie opens, and the child Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) has taken off for the Worlds Fair in New York, with a jetpack he's made from vacuum cleaners and other stuff.  Since it doesn't quite work, he doesn't get the prize, but he does meet a pretty little english lass named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who has faith in him, and lets him in after her father tries to keep him out (of Tomorrowland, of course...).  After he succeeds  in getting in, we're fast forwarded to what seems to be the grown up Walker (George Clooney) trying to narrate a film, or some sort of document, and constantly getting interrupted by a young woman (Britt Robertson)---and then we go back to meet her as a child.  Getting  Walker and Newton together is the prime focus of most of the film, as she is essential to the resolution of the story.  Eventually, they do cross over to Tomorrowland, and how they do it is perfectly ridiculous, in a fun way.

The takeaway message of the film is that we've too lazily accepted the idea that the future is going to be awful because it allows us to do nothing about it (""What can we DO?"" we wail).  Such an attitude is probably a self fulfilling prophecy, and it would be more practical if we had a more optimistic view of the future and tried to do something to ensure that it turns out that way.  It's very uplifting idea that the movie works to good advantage---the Big Speech at the end in fact is pretty much all on that idea.  Sadly, the inadvertent message also comes across all to clear:  The Future Is For White People.  Diversity is merely a ploy and people of color are no more than props.  None of the prime speaking roles went to anyone of color.  People feel quite comfortable saying the most outrageous things about police---when only a few cops are at issue:  Why do we give Hollywood a free pass on racism?  In movie after movie, if Hollywood isn't using people of color in stereotypical roles, or they don't use them at all, they use them as background diversity while everything up front is white.  The whiteness of this film is its biggest flaw and given the importance of it's intended message, that is really pathetic.",1432598400,3,2774,4.419291338582677
7129667,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"It's always disappointing to me to see a movie getting panned before it's even been released. I don't mean people saying things like, ""Based on the trailer, it doesn't look very good,"" or, ""That doesn't look like something I would like to see."" No, I'm talking about full on bashing before a thing has even been released. Some examples come to mind, all movies which under-performed due to extreme negative backlash prior to release: Waterworld, Daredevil, John Carter. Of course, then there's always a movie like (the most recent) The Lone Ranger to give proof to some of that pre-release backlash. [Maybe I shouldn't say that, though, since I still haven't managed to force myself to sit down and watch The Lone Ranger.]

It's rather unfortunate that it looks like Tomorrowland is going to suffer the same kind of fate, because it's quite a fun movie. The worst thing that can be said about it is that it's a movie with a message, but it's not overbearing with its message, not like Happy Feet which picks up some dead fish at the end and slaps you around a bit until you feel like you've been abused. No, Tomorrowland is a choice, a choice you get to make. And it's a fun ride to get there.

The other thing worth noting is that, all things considered, George Clooney is probably the weak link of the film. However, when you're talking about weak links, Clooney is one you'd probably want to have. The problem is that he's really only in the movie to be George Clooney but, then, he's in the movie to be George Clooney. I have to say, I don't think there's anyone better at being George Clooney than George Clooney, so that was a pretty good casting choice, all things considered.

Britt Robertson is great as Casey. She's spunky, headstrong, and equal parts amazed and freaked out by what's going on around her. I'm unfamiliar with her as an actress, though, so I don't know if this was just a role that fit her or if she did a good job in the part. Either way, she was good, and I'll be checking out more from her to see which is which.

Raffey Cassidy was also great. Great enough that you can figure out the thing about her from her acting before you're told the thing about her.

And Hugh Laurie was really good as Nix. I know (now) that he's the famed Dr. House, but I never watched that, so this was really my first experience with him, and I liked him. I'm not saying I'm going to watch House, but I am now interested.

Thomas Robinson was perfectly cast as young Frank. He's just all kid and optimism, and he was fun to watch.

There are a few logic holes in the movie (like Casey watching her future self do something in order to figure out how to do it (a thing I always hate)), but they are few and, really, not very big. Basically, you can explain them away (though you shouldn't have to explain them away, if you know what I mean).

All said, it's a solid movie and a lot of fun to watch. Actually, I think the biggest issue with the movie is not the movie at all; it's the trailer. The trailer doesn't really give you a good idea of what the movie is about, and what it's about is much better than what the trailer leads you to believe. It's certainly not a movie to pass up for no other reason than the bad hype it's getting., and it's a good theater movie.",1432598400,9,3276,4.341503267973856

7129669,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Directed by Brad Bird, the Disney film Tomorrowland features an extraordinary level of Jules Verne- and World's Fair-indebted visual spectacle.  The storyline turns on Casey (Britt Robertson), a rebellious and whip-smart teenager who, after spending a night in jail for trying to halt the demolition of a NASA launch pad, finds an unusual pin among her belongings.  When she touches it, she is transported to the title futuristic metropolis, a place of flying men and swirling hydroponics as marvelous as it is inexplicable.  Her research regarding the origin of the pin leads her to the home of a reclusive inventor (George Clooney) and into the center of a dangerous conflict over the fate of the strange utopia she briefly glimpsed.

The conflict, with its squads of murderous robots and high-energy chases (including a hypnotic stopover at the Eiffel Tower), doubles as an ideological feud:  pragmatic hope versus fatalism, and the film's overt argument for the former at times lapses into didactic strong-arm sloganeering, but the general air of heartfelt, nostalgic enthusiasm mostly compensates.  And every other element in front of and behind the camera is top-notch or close to it.  Bird is clearly engaged with and inspired by the material, and this is my favorite film of his since the masterful Ratatouille.  It is a lengthy picture, but well-paced and punctuated with delightful moments of action, humor, mystery, suspense, and even a highly unconventional, almost tragic romantic subplot which is hard to explain and could have registered as creepy, but is instead a thought-provoking rumination on the stinging, transfixing impact of first love.

Robertson is a decently down-to-earth presence as the resolute heroine, though the character (a proxy for the audience and, by extension, a catalyst for explanatory dialogue) is never the film's most arresting element.  Movie-star-among-movie-stars slash sexiest-man-alive Clooney challenges himself by playing against type, subduing his usual debonair charm to portray an aging man consumed by grief and resentment, but not entirely beyond redemption.  It is a persuasive and stately piece of acting.  However, the most memorable player in the ensemble is one featured in none of the film's advertising:  Raffey Cassidy, a fresh-faced English girl reportedly aged 12 or 13.  She is sensational as Athena, a robot disguised as a child whose primary protocol involves finding the world's best and brightest and recruiting them to contribute to Tomorrowland.  Cassidy expertly draws on the ambiguity of the rolehow much of her beguiling old-soul sentience is a programming illusion?to create an imaginative and tantalizing science-fiction character, and she more than holds her own against seasoned veteran Clooney, with whom she plays a couple intense and poignant scenes.  Their bond, including a final scene which brought a tear or two to my eyes, is ultimately more powerful than the world-in-peril drama.",1432512000,3,2969,5.407809110629067
7129670,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"Tomorrowland (2015)
 Every day is the opportunity for a better tomorrow intones Governor Nix, the autocratic ruler of Tomorrowland.  But the opportunity for a worse tomorrow also exists.  Nix tell us In every moment there's a possibility of a better future, but you people won't believe it.  And because you won't believe it you won't do what is necessary to make it a reality.  Grim words indeed, particularly grim words for a PG rated Disney movie.  Hugh Laurie (House on TV) can play a bad guy as well as his more common dramatic heroes or comic characters.  For his opposite, the good guy, we have the usual high quality performance by George Clooney, another very versatile actor.
 Writer/director Brad Bird has made several huge budget films to prepare him for this $190 million budget mega film.  He directed both the animated The Incredibles and the block buster action film Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.  He also wrote The Incredibles.  His co-writer Damon Lindelof also has a strong background.  He wrote World War Z and also Cowboys and Aliens.  We will wait a while before we call Tomorrowland a financial success.  The $190 million outlay returned only $42 million over the four day holiday week end, which might not be enough.
 There is nothing wrong with this family friendly Disney film, but it does not have the fire or innovation that will bring people thronging into the theaters.  A budget of a mere $100 million would have served just as well.  We do not attend Disney films because of the spectacular special effects.  We want to see pleasant stories, well played, that avoid the tiresome real world.  Tomorrowland has all of this that we could want.  It also has loads of superfluous cool special effects (of which I will say no more, just watch).
 We have not just one but two young heroines.  A smart teenage girl named Casey (well played by up and coming star Britt Robinson.  At 25 she can still play a teen but she plays a grown woman in the current 2015 Nicholas Sparks based film The Longest Ride) is tracked and recruited by an even younger girl, the mission, to save Tomorrow Land and Regular Land from impending doom.
 The younger girl makes the movie for me.  13 year old veteran actress Raffey Cassidy also plays below her age as the exile from Tomorrow Land (Disney film, right?) who finds the one person on earth who might possibly, just maybe, be the one that can save everything.  Young Cassidy made me a believer.  Her mission is to charm the recruits and she can really turn it on.
 Having stars of the quality of Hugh Laurie and George Clooney to back stop the youngsters is a great idea.  The film works at every level.  The direction of a child actress or actor always presents special problems, but director Brad Bird works through any such that we can do nothing but surrender to Athena (Cassidy), the little girl from Tomorrow Land.
 We found Tomorrowland a nice excursion, safe and containing no adult themes to jar us.  True love rears it's tragic head so watch out for a very moving moment.  The two hour and 10 minute long movie rates a strong three and a half saw blades.
 This is safe for the young people and enjoyable for the older folk.  It might not have enough steam to make back the huge investment.",1432512000,5,3264,4.636998254799302
7129671,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"On paper, Tomorrowland was a film designed and built for, well, me.

Directed and co-written by Brad Bird, who after The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol is one of my favorite filmmakers, and set in a retro-future full of jetpacks, jumpsuits and beautiful angular buildings, the movie seemed to be checking off every box on my personal checklist.

The trailers had been mostly mysterious, a tale of a young girl and a pin, and a world beyond ours. But how did the final film turn out? I absolutely loved it.

Teenager Casey Newton (Under The Domes Britt Robinson) is our entry into the world of Tomorrowland. Living in todays world (or one of those not-too-distant futures), Casey laments what our world of wonder has become. She lives near Cape Canaveral, where a NASA launch site is about to become dismantled  putting her father (Tim McGraw) out of work, and ruining her childhood dream to see the stars. Shes hit with the same ideas in school  the world is ending, war is imminent, were screwed, we cant do anything about it. But even with all of that she wants to know simply  How can we fix it? Then one day, fate intervenes as she discovers a mysterious T-shaped pin  that when she touches it, shows her an amazing world beyond anything we thought possible.

Cut from the same cloth as last years Interstellar  although a more optimistic part of it  Tomorrowland is an adventure about achieving something more, achieving greatness. In the vein of Disney live-action classics like Return to Oz or the Amblin Entertainment films of the 80s, its a family friendly journey grounded with realistic characters, even in the most ridiculous of situations.

Tomorrowland sends us as far back as the 1964 Worlds Fair, in as beautiful locales as Paris, France, and into the darkest parts of a wall-to-wall filled sci-fi toy shop. Its a film peppered with jetpacks, robots of different shapes and sizes, and a cranky George Clooney, playing a recluse inventor with a very special connection to Tomorrowland.

Above all else, Tomorrowland serves as a call to action of sorts. Were in a dark, cynical world  reminded 24 hours a day, 7 days a week about how everything is dying, the Earth is irreparable, and war is at our doorstep. But what the film asks  between incredibly fun action sequences, beautiful imagery, and another fantastic score by Michael Giacchino  is what could we be if we decided to push forward and make the best world we can, even with adversity breathing down our neck?

Brad Bird has been dealing with this sort of storytelling over his past films  The Incredibles showcasing why those who are special should be allowed to indulge their abilities, Ratatouille showing that anyone has the ability to be special  but Tomorrowland acts as a call to action of sorts. If we can all be greater, why aren't we? And its that intense optimism that enveloped me during Tomorrowland.

Yes, the movie isn't perfect  theres some third act problems, and some questions I had weren't well addressed  but even with those issues, you have a movie that captivated me for every one of its 130 minutes, with a great cast, stellar performances, and amazing imagery. If you cant fall in love with a film as a character glides through a retro-futuristic city on a homemade jetpack, you may be a little dead inside.

Be accepting of the movies flaws, and let it take you away. Touch the pin and see Tomorrowland. You might just want to make for a better tomorrow.",1432512000,5,3504,4.774461028192372

Their journey is fast, funny, and enjoyably, for all ages. The theme of fighting for hope in a world of hopelessness may seem to be driven home a little too hard, but when the issue is as big as it is in this movie, subtly really isn't an option. Ignore the reviews. Tomorrowland has something for everyone. If you're just looking for a cool movie with big ideas and amazing action, you'll love it.

7129673,4,B00WAJ8RBI,"This is a big handsome action-packed bundle of PG-rated entertainment with an upbeat ending. Part of the pleasure is who's involved, just look at the credits: Disney Studios; Brad Bird (Pixar's premier writer/director); George Clooney (everyone's favorite heartthrob), Hugh Laurie (one of the UK's finest actors); along with Tim McGraw (ask any Country/Western fan) as a classic dad.

This epic battle is not just between good and evil, but between optimism and pessimism. It incorporates many physical battles, high-tech weapons. space flight and blowie uppie stuff, but it works best when two capable girls are giving George Clooney a hard time for his bad attitude.

We begin with an enthusiastic boy whose jet pack doesn't ""quite"" work but is ""recruited"" by a little girl who tells him he is ""different."" He never looks back.

We enjoy:
  * Thomas Robinson (""The Switch"") as Young Frank Walker, the dauntless little boy with the jet pack. He meets Athena at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. (An amazing set piece by the way!)
  * Raffey Cassidy (""Mr. Selfridge"") is Athena, who entices our young hero into the adventure of a lifetime.
  * Hugh Laurie (""House"") Nix is going back ""home"" after the World's Fair. He has plans...
  * Britt Robertson (""The Longest Ride"") is Casey Newton, who has serious objections when her school teachers preach gloom and doom for the planet. She finds a mysterious coin that flips her into another world when she touches it.
  * Tim McGraw (""The Blind Side"") is her father Eddie Newton, a space engineer who is resigned to being downsized.
  * George Clooney (""Gravity"") is Grown-up Frank; this pessimistic curmudgeon just wants Casey to leave him alone. Wait until you see his house!
  * Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key are the proprietors of a novelty shop where Casey tries to buy another one of those mysterious coins.

We enjoyed the humor throughout, the dazzling scenery and the high-tech gadgets, but we most particularly enjoyed the humans, their relationships and their challenges.

7129675,2,B00WAJ8RBI,"Mystery can only take you so far, and then there needs to be some kind of payoff. Since the very beginning, back when the project was known simply as ""1952"" and was supposedly one of Walt Disney's lost projects, Brad Bird's Tomorrowland has been shrouded in an incredible amount of secrecy. Sometimes that works to the film's benefit when audiences are finally let in on what all the cloak 'n dagger were about. And then sometimes it all amounts to nothing. Tomorrowland unfortunately falls in the latter category. Like the Disney theme park from which its name derives, Tomorrowland seeks to inspire within us a hope for a brighter future full of invention and imagination, but all it really needs to do is tell a cohesive story and that's where the experiment sadly fails.

To be fair, Tomorrowland is often the glorious wonder it aspires to be, tapping into the little kid in all of us who dreams of a fantastical future of jet packs and robots. However, an awkward, labored narrative structure derails any chance for Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof to explore the progressive concepts they're so keen to introduce. In essence, it becomes a film solely about one important but overused message about building a better tomorrow in the here and now. Great idea, but the adventure designed to make that message resonant is unremarkable and pretty boring.

Perhaps the most disappointing thing is that, really, there's no actual mystery to the story. The film is EXACTLY what we already knew it was. George Clooney plays Frank Walker, a former boy genius who is now a cynical and jaded middle-aged man. He connects with the whip-smart Casey (Britt Robertson of The Longest Ride) and the unusual Athena (Raffey Cassidy) on a journey to Tomorrowland, a futuristic world Frank was invited to while attending the 1964 World's Fair. The film opens in aggravating fashion, with older Frank attempting (and failing miserably) to explain the dire circumstances that have led to their important mission.  The film then goes through an extended flashback, two of them actually, and by the time the story's setup is finished nearly an entire hour has passed. For a film about progressing into the future Tomorrowland is often stuck going nowhere.

By the time the story truly begins it's difficult to care because we know the ending can't be satisfying. There isn't enough time left for it to be. That's not to say it isn't a visually dazzling spectacle. There are individual scenes that are jaw-dropping and everything we hoped the film would be. Tonally it often resembles the retro whimsy of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, both evocative of the past and embracing of the future. There are cool robots, space ships; buildings that look like something out of The Wizard of Oz, practically everything a little kid could dream up comprise Tomorrowland's gorgeous structure. However, the vast majority of the film isn't spent in Tomorrowland; it's in the present where things are pretty bland. It's like making a Matrix movie and not spending any time in the Matrix. Oh wait, that did happen in two terribly-received sequels. That combined with no clear nemesis or goal to achieve other than ""get to Tomorrowland"", and the film seriously lacks any kind of clear agenda for audiences to latch on to. We know who built Tomorrowland, but are never given a clear idea of how or why.

That the finale amounts to a hammering rant about our obstinate response to global climate change, while offering no clear solutions, only goes to show how poorly this was all put together. This should be old hat for those familiar with Lindolof's work on Lost, a show he had plenty of great ideas for and zero notion how to pull them off. Tomorrowland references geniuses like Thomas Edison, Nicola Tesla, and more; all men who dreamed big and turned those dreams into reality. Unfortunately, while the film was clearly inspired by these architects of the future, it doesn't do much to live up to their innovative ideals.",1432512000,8,3998,4.873529411764705
