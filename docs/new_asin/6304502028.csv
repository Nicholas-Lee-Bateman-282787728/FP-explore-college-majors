7873069,3,6304502028,"A screwball comedy in the vein of Billy Wilder, ""Plucking the Daisy"" is notable for giving Brigitte Bardot a role to play beyond her typical turns as a ""sex kitten"".

In this film, Bardot plays a young aspiring writer, Agnes Dumont, daughter of a conservative military general, and sister to an artist.  Her artist brother has found a job as a guide for the 'Balzac Museum', and when Agnes leaves home by train to pursue her writing dreams, she joins her brother by breaking in to what she thinks is his ""townhouse"".  Two playboy newspapermen who befriend Agnes on the train take turns trying to woo her when she becomes a fellow Parisian.  The newspaperman (Daniel Gelin) and his photographer buddy play off each other sort of like Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in ""Some Like It Hot"".

Bardot is demure in her role as writer and love interest, with her hair usually worn ""up"" and not cascading loosely.  She looks a little like Nastassia Kinski, when Kinski first appeared on screen in the early 80's: coquettish, but innocent.

As the plot progresses, Bardot is forced to make amends for swapping a first edition of Balzac for cash, by earning some quick dough entering a striptease contest.  Because of her shyness she wears a mask and assumes the persona of ""Sophia"", an Italian girl.  Her newspaper buddies are assigned to cover the contest and the rakish Gelin also falls for ""Sophia"", not knowing she is really Agnes.  When Agnes is forced to repeat her performance in her hometown by her ""contract"", the newspapermen follow her, thinking they will unmask ""Sophia's"" identity.

The hijinks are not up to the level of classic comedy, but the direction and the cinematography are crisp, and there is the added piquancy of the European frankness: when the stripteasers perform their routines, except for Bardot the clothes really do come off.

This film was also known as ""Please Mr. Balzac"", and ""Madamoiselle Striptease"".",1411430400,,1925,4.853211009174312
7873070,4,6304502028,"DVD transfer is very good.  The images are sharp and clear.  This is a black and white picture in French with English subtittles.

Brigitte is wonderful as a runaway school girl gone to Paris to make her fortune.  Her misadventures make the storyline but it's pure Bardot so her fans should enjoy this one.  Oh yes, there is brief nudity but Brigitte keeps it on which is part of the story.  She wins a striptease contest even though her modesty keeps her from ""Plucking the Daisy"" as the title (American) suggests.  This film is about as funny as it can get for American audiences who have to read the subtitles.

Recommended to just about all audiences with a special nod to fans of Bardot.",1245024000,,692,4.524193548387097

7873072,3,6304502028,"Bardot completed her acting apprenticeship by filming Marc Allegret's ""En Effeuillant la Marguerite"" in 1956...

This film saw Bardot do the famous striptease that, even with a heavy dose of modesty, caused a noisy tumult... Catholic cinematic authorities were horrified by Brigitte's particular style of freedom of expression, and advised against showing the film anywhere...

Bardot soon became a symbol of eroticism incarnate, of pure provocation, and, in the conservative societal atmosphere of the time, synonymous with scandal...

This scandal turned even more explosive when the first film directed solely by Vadim, starring his sizzling young bride, had its premiere...",1167177600,3,677,5.75
7873073,5,6304502028,"I first saw this movie when I was ten and it began my lifelong fascination with striptease. But, I had only seen a version (probably trimmed for North America) featuring only partial strip, a version which was later released on video. When I saw the DVD version, my eyes popped out of my head : the contestants performing just before Bardot in the striptease contest were fully nude at the end of their act! It was so unbelievable and unexpected that at first I thought that it was fake, that the remaining clothes had been digitally edited out, but no! As I saw by comparing with the VHS version, those are really different takes on the same scene! And the quality of the transfer is top-notch, much better than on the VHS.",1028764800,21,724,4.492424242424242
7873074,2,6304502028,"The story line of this film is an enjoyable vehicle which displays the timeless beauty of Brigitte Bardot. This VHS version is marred, however, by the terrible audio and video quality. 5 Stars for Bardot + 0 Stars for the quality of the tape = 2 Stars. If you are a big fan of Bardot (such as myself) you may want to pick to this up to add to your collection, otherwise buy something else.",1016841600,4,389,4.2
