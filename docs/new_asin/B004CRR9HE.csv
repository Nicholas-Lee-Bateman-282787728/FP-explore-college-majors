8423456,5,B004CRR9HE,I enjoyed this program and it is fun to recall the great tv shows and to see the stars as they are now while they are being interviewed. I love Linda Evans from Big Valley and Dynasty.,1398124800,,184,4.0
8423457,4,B004CRR9HE,"Had caught some of these episodes on PBS but had missed the one about TV westerns. So that was principal reason for purchase and it did an adequate job. Only an hour (approx.) long so a lot of favorite programs not covered but what they did, they did pretty well. Recommended for those old enough to have caught these shows the first time around or those young enough to be curious about what 50's/60's TV was all about.",1394236800,,420,4.397435897435898
8423458,5,B004CRR9HE,"Yes, I have been around long enough to see many of these show from the beginning, or at least early reruns.  These compilation descriptions of the early years of tv is a great historical time line of the growth and creative genious explaining the series of today.  It also gives you a trip down memory lane of your favorite actors when they were at their best or just starting out.  Giving you floods of memories or introductions to actors or tv shows you have only heard about.",1382486400,,478,4.471264367816092
8423459,5,B004CRR9HE,"I love old TV shows.  I'd seen the Pioneers of Children's Television show when it originally aired and I thought it was a delightful discussion of local children's TV shows and the personalities, such as Willard Scott and Jim Henson, who had gone on to greater fame after cutting their teeth on local television.  I will say, I like what I saw here and S3 but I haven't gotten a chance to see S1 yet and hopefully I will get to soon.",1381017600,,433,4.2682926829268295
8423460,5,B004CRR9HE,"Once again PBS does a great series. Look forward to the next season, this series shows how and who and why we watch on TV today and in the movies.",1358726400,2,146,3.9
8423461,5,B004CRR9HE,An excellent review of the roots of good TV. They don't make them this good anymore! Anyone interested in the roots of TV should see these subjects!,1315785600,6,148,4.518518518518518
