5979566,5,B00FEHCQYW,"I give this 5 stars because it held my attention from the start
all the way to the end and I did not get up or pause the stream.
Plenty of good fights, very realistic, and a very good story line.
Very entertaining. I will buy the DVD.",1380499200,,234,3.8958333333333335
5979567,4,B00FEHCQYW,Tiger Chen is a great fighter and I enjoyed watching this movie.  I was reluctant at first but I'm glad I took the risk and ordered the movie.  If you are a martial art fan and if you like a lot of action you'll definitely get a KICK out of this movie. But Keanu Reeves should had chosen another actor and not himself to star in the movie.  Reeves in the movie reminded me of the Matrix.,1380499200,4,387,4.0
5979568,4,B00FEHCQYW,"Plot was great, could of had some more detail in the fighting scenes but overall it was worth the money!",1380326400,,104,4.25
5979569,4,B00FEHCQYW,"The film centers on Tiger Chen (Tiger Hu Chen) who is a competition Tai Chi fighter. He is recruited by the wealthy and secretive Donaka Mark (Keanu Reeves)  to fight privately for him against a series of diverse fighters. His Chi becomes out of control. Donaka is also playing a cat and mouse game with the police.

The film consists of numerous fight sequences, some long, some short. It also has numerous scenes where Tiger has to cope with problems that require him to keep fighting.  There is no anti-gravity fighting in this film. The film freely mixes Chinese and English and has subtitles in both languages. Unfortunately the font is white as is the garment background making some words impossible to read.

It was one of the more entertaining fight films I have seen.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1380326400,57,821,4.753521126760563
5979570,4,B00FEHCQYW,"I've seen so many underground fight movies in the past few years.  The most mundane and least spectacular but also my favorite of the bunch was Fight Club.  This is not like that movie.  Man of Tai Chi is fairly straightforward, not really about anything other than inner peace and kung fu fighting.  It has a hint of supernatural elements, as well, but it only really uses those elements toward the end of the plot and uses them in a very laid back fashion that does not take away from the story.

As far as martial arts films go, this is nowhere near the best in my opinion, but that is just an opinion.  This movie has a lot to offer martial arts fans.  It shows off a lot of spectacular stunts without going into the ridiculous building climbing or wire work.  Of course, I would not be surprised if wire rigs were used for some of the stunts in this film, because there are a lot of flips and turns, some of which are done in slightly slow motion, and some supernatural energy-based attacks which probably required some way of dragging bodies across the scene.  That said, everything was fairly realistic and down-to-Earth for the bulk of the film.

What this movie lacks is emotion.  You never quite feel at one with the main character, because you barely know anything about him.  He seems like a nice guy who was suckered into kung fu training by an old man who claims it will benefit him.  That would be the appropriate assumption, but here's the golden question: Why is he training in Tai Chi?  This question is not answered.  I was a bit disappointed by the oversight in the plot, but I was also a little relieved, because I prefer to leave some questions unanswered so my mind has something to be creative with.  I like to think about what may have happened to set him on the path he takes in the movie.  Chances are his life wasn't very interesting before the events taking place in the film's plot, but you do not know that, and that is a good thing.  This movie leaves some room for imagination.

Keanu Reeves plays his part as an evil business man brilliantly.  I never quite felt that he was Neo from The Matrix in this film.  He really shows he has some acting skills in this film, that's for sure!  Fortunately, the other actors and actresses play their roles equally well, and there was really only one scene that bothered me throughout the entire movie.  Since describing the scene in any way may spoil part of the plot, I will avoid talking about it, but I must say that it did not take away from the enjoyment of the film.

I bought this movie.  I did not rent it.  I say this to give you some perspective on how committed I was to seeing this movie from the start.  I went into the experience expecting something and get what I expected.  I rated this movie a 4/5 to be fair.  It is not a perfectly crafted film and has a few plot holes that bother me, but it is enjoyable as a fight movie.  You can't really expect much else.  If you're looking for good fight scenes, look no further.  This movie has some great choreography and realism while also offering a bit of classic kung fu movie elements, and it all mixes quite well.",1380326400,2,3151,4.351629502572899
5979571,5,B00FEHCQYW,WOW! Congrats to Keanu for his Directing debut! Also WOW for Tiger Chen's acting debut! The film gripped my full attention and never let go!! Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys not only martial arts movies of course Keanu Reeves is still outstanding!!,1516492800,,254,4.930232558139535

5979574,5,B00FEHCQYW,"This is one of the most fast paced, high energy martial arts movies I've ever seen...coincidentally John Wick is my #1 pick.",1513296000,,124,4.681818181818182
5979575,3,B00FEHCQYW,"its ok, not what I expected from the cover, and  a lot of action, good fighting, but like I said...its ok.",1511049600,,106,4.0476190476190474
5979576,3,B00FEHCQYW,"""Man of Tai Chi"" (2013) is Keanu Reeves' first directorial effort and collaboration with his friend Tiger Chen, who did action work on the ""Matrix"" movies. In Hong Kong, Chief Inspector Suen Jing Si  (Karen Mok) is pursuing businessman Donaka Mark (Keanu Reeves), whom she believes runs an underground ""fight club"" and may be involved in more sinister crimes. When an informant's tip-off leads to nothing, her boss Superintendent Wong (Simon Yam) closes the case against Jing Si's objections. Meanwhile, Mark has noticed the upcoming Tai Chi star ""Tiger"" Chen Lin Hu (Tiger Chen) in the Wulin Wong Championship. He invites Tiger Chen to fight for him for pay, which the young fighter initially refuses, as it would be dishonorable. But when the 600-year-old Ling Kong Temple in which he trains with his Master Yang (Yu Hai) is threatened by developers who take advantage of its safety code violations, Tiger Chen decides to fight for the money.

I can't comment on the creativity of the fight scenes, as I'm not a connoisseur. Yuen Woo-ping directed the action; Tiger Chen is very skilled. There are two scenes that incorporate supernatural elements; the rest are hand-to-hand fighting. They look like real fighting apart from the fighters not being dead or black and blue from head to toe. I didn't find Tiger Chen charismatic as an actor, unfortunately. Keanu Reeves embraces his role as an evil mastermind, but it would have been nice to know more about his character. A lot of talent worked on this film, but more talent was needed in the writing department. The script by Michael G. Cooney is hackneyed, predictable, uninteresting. The Hong Kong police officer is more of a deus ex machina than a character or plotline. Better character writing would have elevated this tired tale. ""Man of Tai Chi"" bombed at the box office, not for the fighting but for the writing. In Mandarin and English with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Anchor Bay 2013): Bonus features include ""The Making of Man of Tai Chi"" (8 min) featurette, in which Keanu Reeves talks about the film's conception and his experience directing. Tiger Chen and director of photography Elliot Davis are also interviewed. There is a feature commentary by director/actor Keanu Reeves and Tiger Chen. The commentary is sporadic. Neither man has much to say. The film is in Mandarin and English with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles.",1509753600,,2419,4.997518610421836

5979582,5,B00FEHCQYW,"This movie is powerful. Keanu Reeves certainly understands his role as an actor, but he nailed it as a director. Normally I do not watch many 'martial arts' movies. Yet this one is meant to prove the various paths we all choose throughout life. Not to be overly 'waxing-karmonic' but that is exactly what this movie proves. The choices we make as a person, the effect those choices have on others around you, & the reasons regarding your own life path. This film has many layers...just like a life.",1505779200,,498,4.606741573033708

5979598,4,B00FEHCQYW,"Keanu is a bad guy. This flick starts out brutal and while it maintains a lethal mentality of the fist and foot kind it never rises above the shock and severity of its first ten minutes. A young, impetuous but naturally gifted martial artist who is being trained by a monk to harness his strengths desires to uncage his inner tiger and go for the kill. He gets sucked into PPV death matches and finds that he likes it. Hes getting rich, getting some notoriety, and going bad despite his best effort not to. Of course his monk master doesnt approve and they have a showdown, as does he and Keanus bad bad guy. You know who wins. Man of Tai Chi was directed by Keanu Reeves and draws slightly from his Matrix film experience and style but the goal of this film is sheer brutal fight attitude and Asian revenge flair. It could have been a lot better by being less obvious. It could have been a lot worse by being less viscerally exciting. 3.75 stars.",1487635200,,947,4.3559322033898304

Me no likey the brain malfunctions. End of important note. You may skim from here.

The movie was extremely cheesy at times, which is par for the course in this genre. It was, however, full of surprisingly well-choreographed martial arts scenes. The plot.... well, it has just enough of a twist (maybe 'twist' is too strong of a word...more like it lilts lazily to the left?) to keep your attention.",1483747200,,533,4.911111111111111

5979655,5,B00FEHCQYW,Man of Tai Chi was a fantastic film. Keanu Reeves did a marvelous job of creating a story about a martial artist spiritually journals down a path were he must decide who and what he is. With the guidance of his master he struggles to hold onto who he is and what Tai Chi is as he's tempted by the protagonist  (Keanu Reeves) by pushing him to his limits to turn a pure hearted man into a killer.,1483660800,,395,4.064102564102564

Reeves was slow and very predictable with his moves.  Granted I couldn't do what Reeves did, but compared to the star, he was slow and an inferior opponent to the star of this movie.  That is where I started to lose interest.  After that scene, my interest was back up.

While it may not be an instant genre classic, it did not disappoint; and I was impressed with Keanu Reeves' film direction. My only reason for not rating Man of Tai Chi 5 stars is the camerawork during the fight scenes. Having grown up watching Bruce Lee, and Hong Kong action films in general, I did not like the jerky-style camera angles, the unnecessary combat close-ups, and the sudden camera cutaways all to make the fight scenes appear more fast-paced or ""fluid"". These effects didn't do the actors or the choreographers performances justice. As for the heart of the story-one fans of the martial arts genre will readily recognize-about proving yourself/ your beliefs, discovering your true path, and ultimately evolving as an artist of your craft, and as an individual.

Overall, this project of Reeves' was tightly well-written and directed.",1480464000,,921,5.059210526315789

Definitely a fine mix of Hollywood, China-Wood, and a silent-scream-antithesis of them both. There is too much junk action out there.  This film succeeds at appealing to the string pulling masters of propaganda and junk (just enough), and simultaneously stimulating the sincere viewer, the seeker of the deep and true.  It is not ironic that Neo, the navigator and mediator of the false and true is responsible for the direction of this baffling dichotomy of a film.  Both those who are lost of reason, and those driven by purpose will find this a worthwhile viewing.

I liked the movie and the martial arts scenes are very good. The actor that plays Tiger Chen is great in them. I was really pleased to see that Keanu also directed this film. I do not think he gets the accolades he deserves as he is so eclectic and morphs to just about any genre.

Without giving away the plot, a couple of times the movie slows down a bit, but it is good search between the ying-yang nature of man.",1470700800,,503,3.9702970297029703

The martial arts sequences are among some of the best that I've seen and are filmed in uncut shots.  Moviegoers who can understand Cantonese, Mandarin, and English will also get a slight tickle from being able to understand the language transitions and recognize stars from different areas of the world.

5980332,5,B00FEHCQYW,"It's actually a good movie.  It has a good balance of being serious without being overly serious or goes the other way making fun of itself along the way.

5980335,4,B00FEHCQYW,"I enjoyed this move a lot. Wished that they could have gone deeper into both the philosophy and martial science of Taiji. Tiger Chen's Gong Fu is very good. As a Taiji enthusiast, it seems that his Taiji seems a bit influenced by external martial training. His Taiji Master in the movie looked to be the real deal.

I found the story compelling and entertaining. The big lesson revolves around his inner battle between ego and spirit. His master keeps telling him to ""meditate Tiger"". As many of us do, it is only when we wake up and become aware of our dark side, can we finally choose the light. I won't tell you how this happens in the movie. A great life lesson awaits those who able to realize it.

Perhaps Keanu Reeves will create a sequel, if so, I will absolutely see. Tell the world more about the spiritual aspect ofTaiji Mr. Reeves, the world needs it.",1463788800,,863,4.421383647798742

You find out that not all have what it takes to get to the top and there are consequences for that.  Pace of this movie was good and the downstream quality was great!

5980395,3,B00FEHCQYW,I wanted this to be better.  It was okay.  I guess I had been building it up in my mind because I had been wanting to see it for a while.  I seem to remember Keanu spearheading a new camera design for action movies.  I was expecting more in terms of cinematography and lighting. Plot was just okay.,1462752000,,298,4.086206896551724

5980397,5,B00FEHCQYW,I enjoyed this movie.  The fight scenes were creative and filmed very well.  Tiger Hu Chen did a great job of expressing the emotional and physical turmoil he encountered when he was reluctantly drawn into the underground fight world.  Keanu Reeves expressed more emotion in this movie than in his last ten combined!  He is aging very well.,1462752000,,340,4.810344827586207

5980400,3,B00FEHCQYW,"Well, what can I say?  As an instructor of martial Ta'i Chi Chuan for the past couple of decades, I had hopes that this movie would incorporate more of the martial applications of Chi and of Ta'i Chi.  However, even though Tiger Chen is good at his fighting style, other than waving his arms around a few times, there is very little Ta'i Chi in the movie.  The closest they came were some of the pushing hands scenes with his Master.  Still, you go get to see some southern style Kung Fu and some stylized White Crane.  Keanu Reeves is clearly giving too much credence to his learning of Kung Fu in the Matrix.  Maybe, he should plug in for a refresher?  In any case, this movie is an alright way to burn a couple of hours.  But, there are a lot more use of subtitles than I anticipated.  I guess they thought it would make the move more authentic.  I've certainly seen worse movies on the Chinese fighting styles.",1462752000,,914,4.323529411764706

5980404,4,B00FEHCQYW,A good movie. Good moral lesson about purpose and considering the consequences of one's actions. My 12-year-old grandson enjoyed it and understood the lesson it was teaching about making good choices and doing the right things for the right reasons. Entertaining and thought provoking  a good combination.,1462752000,,305,5.48936170212766

5980413,4,B00FEHCQYW,"I thought this was interesting twist on a martial arts movie.

5980523,4,B00FEHCQYW,"You want action, you got it. The caliber of the fight scenes is extremely creative and well executed. Not your run of the mill martial arts flick, and that's a good thing. Tiger Hu Chen, et all deliver high caliber fight performances, and one of the most realistic portrayals of a martial arts fighter in recent memory. Although there where many great fighters who tried there hand against Tiger, I will say the last ""sparring"" session with his master had me holding my breath. Two things that could have been improved; character development was well crafted but a little slow, and the ending seemed a little rushed and not quite as polished as the body of the film. Overall I give this movie 4 stars for the non-stop, well choreographed action scenes, & Tigers overall performance. Keanu Reeves performance was reminiscent of his recent roles but that's he we like our Keanu. If I where to compare Man of Tai Chi to another martial arts film I would say it's of the same caliber as ""IP Man"", however I would rate IP Man 5 stars.

5980537,2,B00FEHCQYW,"Reeves is wooden ( as usual) and lives in an unrealistic world of black and chrome ( maybe he misses the matrix universe). The whole concept of some secret underground multi-millionaire fight to the death cabal is an old, and overdone, theme. The martial arts are impressive except the last scene which consists of a climatic fight between Tiger Chen and Reeves. In this scene it is so obvious Reeves is superlatively inferior to Chen; his moves are so slow and imprecise compared to Chen's lighting fast and acrobatic moves. Also the corrupt police chief who falls under the persistence of the honest detective is a theme that should be put to rest. The problem with this movie was the story. The martial arts are superb and the cinematographic details are excellent. Even the mixed acting could be pardoned if the story would have been more compelling. Instead of creating a matrix criminal world of gladiatorial battles, Reeves could have created a compelling, and more realistic, Rocky like drama. Imagine a kid in China going up the ranks to acquire recognition that Tai Chi can be, if properly used, an effective martial art. At the end of the movie he could have used the "" invisible"" punch with a truly dramatic effect, much like the karate kid used his swan kick ( or whatever it was) in his final match. Or maybe the story could have been of a Tai Chi student cleaning his neighborhood from Triad thugs; well now that I think about it all these themes have been done so many times already that the result may have been the same.",1461196800,,1538,4.637362637362638

5980636,5,B00FEHCQYW,I've been a fan of Keanu for a long time. And though I can only admire what those who practice any of the many disciplines of martial arts I can say I really enjoyed this movie... except that even though I bought it in Blu-ray I wasn't able to select to hear the dialect in English. To understand what was going on I had to pause play pause play. But outside of that it was a very good movie.,1459814400,,392,3.9746835443037973

Reeves has a broad range of acting abilities, and this proves it.  He is sadistic and dark in this movie.  I didn't know Reeves directed it until I finished watching it.

5980641,5,B00FEHCQYW,"Same old martial arts story. Nothing to expect more. Screenplay is decent so they don't irritate you with narration. But nicely composed stunts.

5980687,5,B00FEHCQYW,"I started watching Man of Tai Chi half jokingly and with very low expectations (I mean directed by Keanu Reeves? C'mon!,) but was very pleasantly surprised by it's production values and choreography.
This movie absolutely delivers in terms of action sequences.

The story is simple and straight forward, but buried beneath the crimes and underground fighting is an interesting analysis of whether martial arts are used for discipline and self defense, or just another way for one to kick ass and fuel the ego  It is entertaining to see Tiger's change of personalities and use of different fighting styles to reflect this as his character develops throughout the movie.
The pacing starts out a bit slow, but ramps up in pace quickly after the first serious fight.

I am happy to write that there are no pointless sex scenes or obscene amounts of gore  MoTC manages to keep a balance of grace and style despite the hard-hitting fights.

If you like stylish and well choreographed action scenes, then you should absolutely give this movie a try, otherwise you're probably better of looking elsewhere.",1459296000,3,1097,4.972677595628415

There is lots of various martial arts styles in this movie, and the plot is ok.  Keanu shows off his own martial arts abilities as well, as he is very big into the Asian martial arts culture. Sub titles get a little annoying, but they are easy to follow.  All-in-all, its a predictable movie, but its decent and keeps your attention.",1459209600,,444,4.45679012345679

5980865,3,B00FEHCQYW,Man of Tai Chi was an alright movie. There were several times during the movie that the action seemed to slow down but it was better made movie than other oriental movies I have watched.,1458950400,,186,4.3428571428571425

The plot gives us the usual scenarios of ""earnest but rash student must save his school"", so don't look for much there. It's also fun to see Keanu as a real villain and use his considerable fighting skills. This film probably won't grow an audience for martial Tai Chi, but those who love the art will get a kick out of it!",1458518400,,446,4.258823529411765

5980966,4,B00FEHCQYW,"This was actually a good movie. Keanu did a respectable martial arts movie. If I recall correctly the movie was either criticized on the states or maybe it flopped financially.  I suppose it didn't do well overseas, which is interesting due to the large Chinese/Hong Kong audience it seemed to be marketed towards.  I really think it was panned b/c it was Keanu's attempt to escape the yoke of the Hollywood system that had pretty much abandoned him until John Wick. The Hollywood system is like a gang...blood in blood out--you're almost lucky if they forget about you considering some weird gossip that I won't get into here. Anyway it's worth a watch and yes their are subtitles, but don't let that deter you. Watch it when you're folding laundry or some such thing as that so you can stay mildly engage with the screen.",1457827200,2,823,4.6689655172413795

5980969,5,B00FEHCQYW,"I have to give this movie credit when credit is due. Most movies today are full of violence, nudity, and gore, for no real reason. They substitute these things in to replace substance. This movie can tell multiple stories, and can be viewed in a very religious manner. Its a story of the path to darkness, its a story about good vs. evil, and its a story about redemption (or rebirth). Keanu Reeves did a excellent job directing this movie, the main actor did a great job. I am truly impressed.",1457740800,10,494,4.43956043956044

Good martial arts scenes are hard to shoot, and I really found the direction fit perfectly with the choreography. Which is unfortunately rare.

They added a reality show twist, which actually jived and was pleasantly original as far as fight movies go.  The pace was excellently executed.  I loved how the movie kept drawing you in further as it progressed.  The fight choreographs were not the best I've seen, but they were satiating and abundant, without being overly so.  I mean, I was expecting to see way more Tai Chi considering the title of the movie. It is quite kid friendly, no sex, nudity or (out of context) gruesomeness, although there are some abrubt neck breaking murder scenes.  The real bonus was seeing Keanu in his break out role as a villain.  I expect seeing more of him in this role.",1456617600,,835,4.671232876712328

He was not too good in the remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still' but he was terrific in 'John Vick'. I find that I look for his movies now the same way I look for Jason Stratham's.

If a conversation in the movie would have been in either language it would have made it a better scene for me.
Keanu's character needed to be better explained in the fact that he was a martial artist and also what kind of company he owned and how he was able to pull off these ""fights"" under the radar of the police.

The sound design and score is excellent with only one scene where it felt OTT.
I can't fault the direction or cinematography. The way the film is able to move very quickly and still keep all the important details clear is impressive and the viewer is never patronized or coddled with clumsy subplots.
The wire work is subtle and used very sparingly and while overall the movie favors brisk realism you're always left a little space to wonder if there isn't something supernatural going on - just like real life.

This movie proved to me that people will watch anything and say its good, Some of you have given this 5 stars...REALLY, What would you give the matrix or lord of the rings, Gladiator and etc..

And to be honest, I wish that I would have been able to see the ""Keanu Reeves"" I was saw in the ""Matrix"" fighting scenes, as well as the ""47 Ronin"", that showed his proficiency in the ""Martial Arts"" action that I am used to. This movie had the potential to show some extraordinary fight scenes, but were left lacking. Not because of the principles and acting of the ""Tai Chi"", but because of the other styles presented in this film. The story not only lags, but the overall acting in the film could have been quite a bit better, as well as the way the cut scenes.

So essentially, we have a foolish hero who is hard to root for despite his talents as a martial artist. The fights are decent, but little more than decent as they're aided by special wires that are overused. Had the story had characters I could care about and a better story, I would've been more involved in this film. As a big martial arts fan (someone who loves Bruce Lee's Return of the Dragon, Jackie Chan's Drunken Master I and II, and Keanu Reeves in the Matrix as well as John Wick), I was very disappointed in this Reeves produced and directed film.

5981250,4,B00FEHCQYW,"If Bill and Ted were to encounter the villian Donneka Mark, they would aptly say, ""How's it goin', evil crazy dude?"". This film purports to be a metaphysical struggle for an innocent man's soul as he struggles with the pure ideals of Tai Chi vs the down and dirty demands of a fight tournament and his own desire to win, his own aggression and less pure motives. But on a simpler level, it's just a guy who's willing to fight at the rich man's  pleasure, until he finds out 1. That he's being intentionally manipulated, his life being broadcast as a reality show, and 2. that the boss gets off on having the fighters off one another. Unclear which of these two offenses bothers him more. In any case, at this point he's understandably willing to go to the cops. Film is overall compelling and well-directed, our protaganist sympathetic.  Just barely, I was able to suspend my disbelief that puny little Tiger could be such a physical force to be reckoned with. I know nothing of true martial arts, but the supposed ""soft tai chi used in a hard way"" moves to me resembled ice dancing--lots of lateral twirling and landing on one's feet like a cat.  I tuned in for Keanu, who was mostly a lot of fun as the unhinged boss, but his maniacal laugh was just unacceptable, sorry. And for some reason a supernatural element snuck in--in places where the pure Tai chi could not win the day, magical forces took over to ensure that the right man won the contest. I almost felt like this was an Asian redo of Devil's Advocate, and Keanu wanted to try his hand at being Pacino.",1434153600,,1565,4.465034965034965

5981253,2,B00FEHCQYW,"Based on an apparently very simple theme, MTC is a long succession of fighting due to introduce us to the Tai Chi martial art. The professionalism of both choreography and staging, which reaches high clarity, even some elegance seldom combined with such a topic, successfully proves to be a double stylistic achievement to be praised. Having said that, what is left of the script and the film directors intentions?

The Tai Chi fighter, Tiger Chen, who employs great talent and technical prowess for the most laudable sake of completeness, does not however stop palling on us: he manages neither to let us share in his interest in his art, nor to demonstrate the latters specific spiritual dimension!
Certainly the tempter has to play his role: from the very beginning, Donaka Mark, some caricature of an extremely wealthy capitalist, an arrogant and contemptuous high-roller, shows himself to be a murderer marked with icy violence. Ready to pay a lot for treating himself to the decline of a human being throughout his whole process of decay before making this degradation become the property of other well-off in need of thrills, Donaka obviously represents the God of hell.
An absolute aesthetics around underground worlds is implemented, especially in the places which Donaka likes appearing on (crime bunker, personal room for fighting, office, private flat, even the final arena wedged between the temples walls), all of which having the colour of reinforced concrete. These gloomy spots deprived of day light are hell stays from which, according to Jeremy Benthams Panopticon (1787), Gods domination is maintained through looking. Sitting in an arc-shaped sofa looking like some real tear in an ancient theatre, Donaka oversees everything from his living-room of a cooling beauty (as sober and hard as inside the graves depicted by Edgar Allan Poe, but not kitsch like Roger Cormans adaptations). An additional aesthetics for dissimulation is thus elaborated on in such a specific way that dissimulation is entirely shown to the audience: the two-way mirror is broken during a wrestling bout, and wearing a mask is useless since even the female inspector knows the murderers identity. As an indirect consequence, this intended show-up within a plan of deceit pushes the criminal investigation into the background.

Well, what does Donaka Mark actually conceal? Here MTC develops in another way.
It is worth recalling that MTCs very first film frame alternates full-screen white flashes and short fades to black. It can also be reminded that the traditional Taoist symbol (taijitu) represents a black and white inverted double helix, each helix having a centring eye in the other colour. If Tiger Chen and Donaka Mark respectively embody the white and dark parts of the double helix, the whole film aims at demonstrating that death forces are penetrating into the Tai Chi man: I did know that you have them deep in your heart, Donaka is whispering him before dying. Whereas many film directors bore us stiff with the clumsy salvation of an insipid bad guy, MTC displays the best possible ploy. At the end of a voyeurism session, Donaka is heading for a rock-carved chapel which is adorned with a stone garden and a Buddha sheltered in a niche. He is having a seat, going silent in front of a wall engraved with a kind of huge and incomplete three-legged triskel. The hardly 10-second scene is (deliberately) going unnoticed We are still given all freedom in thinking of the substance of this so-suggested existence of an inner life dedicated to meditation The films burdensome and didactic dialectic is taken over by subtlety, with no gratuitous and unacceptable complacency, for a most arduous arguing in favour of a possible way to the light side of evil. This sensitive artistry proves to be just as much as likely to achieve a daring and original iconographic design of good and evil, which keeps away from Judaeo-Christian Manicheanism and meets Orient-inspired requirements (Taoism, Zoroastrianism, etc.). This however is utterly not enough for enabling us to put up with the tedious round of recurring, thus nauseating tournaments What a pity!

5981285,3,B00FEHCQYW,"So it appears that Keanu Reaves SO MUCH enjoyed his intensive training in martial arts for the Matrix trilogy, that eventually he conceived the desire to DIRECT a martial arts movie.one in which he would also STAR (as the bad guy, no less!) and in which the famous martial artist and choreographer Yuen Wo Ping would work the fight choreography and the martial artist who prepared him for Matrix, Tiger Chen, has lead role as a conflicted good guy.

Theres nothing truly groundbreaking about the film in my opinion.  At least it reserves the really non-credible scenes (of which there aren't all that many, fortunately) for the latter half, and in the first half, when there is fighting, it looks at least as if it COULD be real (even if wires were sometimes involved)Well, Ill give it a solid C.  One could probably do a lot worse with a martial arts film, but there are also some that are a lot better.

5981320,4,B00FEHCQYW,"It seems that for years, fans of kick-flicks (like myself) had to import movies from Hong Kong in order to see good fights and stunt work, especially without that awful shaky-cam rock-video editing.  Since prolific fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping (serving here as action director) made it possible for non-martial-artist-Hollywood-actors like Keanu Reeves (serving here as director) to look proficient in kung fu (with 1999's ""The Matrix""), China has essentially fallen off the map in the world of exciting movie fights, mostly from insisting that nearly every scene of martial arts since 2000 be done with either ridiculous wires, artsy slow motion, or both (yes, I know there are exceptions).  So a dozen years later the very same American actor who symbolized Chinese movie-fight downfall would come into China to film his own directorial debut and ironically deliver fight scenes that were more competently filmed and traditional than any I'd seen in Chinese cinema in several years.  What the hell?

Reeves plays Donaka, a wealthy man in Hong Kong who hosts a closed-circuit reality show involving fighters he selects.  He soon chooses a seemingly docile Tai Chi practitioner named Tiger (Tiger Hu Chen, ""House of Fury"", who's very good) as his next prospect.  Tiger has been studying for a long time and is the last descendent of Master Yang (the always awesome but seldom seen Yu Hai, ""Yellow River Fighter"") and the Ling Kong Temple, which is currently being threatened by developers, which causes Tiger to eventually accept Donaka's offer.  Complicating things further is officer Sun Jingshi (Karen Mok, ""Black Mask""), who's after Donaka, but has been ordered off the case.

Thematically, this is the kind of movie that Nicolas Winding Refn (""Drive"") might make if he tackled kung fu and made busier films.  It wasn't until my 2nd viewing that I really noticed the dualistic struggle within Tiger.  In the presence of Master Yang (who is concerned about Tiger's ""chi""), he is calm yet impatient.  While fighting for Donaka, Tiger is ferocious yet compassionate, noticeably more principled than those he's surrounded by.  He has a choice to make.  One method gets results, the other doesn't require them, and it's difficult to see what's better long term from a dualistic (yin & yang) point of view.  Good form, Reeves!

Of the dozen-or-so fights, all but one are 1-on-1's, and all but two are pretty decent.  Reeves and his crew used a new type of steadicam that aids in the fluidity of filming from different angles in tight spaces with continuous flow, so there's a unique look to much of the fisticuffs here.  Editing's more of an asset than a liability, too.  That being said, there's still something missing from the fights.  Lacking impact, I suppose.  I enjoyed them well enough, except for the two aforementioned brawls, where the crew completely forgot that they were trying to make good fight scenes and threw in some unnecessary strobe lights and wires.  Oh, well, I can overlook that.  What I can NOT overlook, however, is their handling of the cameo appearance by Iko Uwais (""The Raid""), his first outside of his native Indonesia.  His presence is brief and adds absolutely nothing to the film.  Bad form, Reeves!

The DVD from Anchor Bay has a nice widescreen picture with 2.40:1 aspect ratio and a 105 minute run-time.  The only available language track has English, Cantonese, and Mandarin with English subtitles.  Additional subtitles available in English (for the hearing impaired) and Spanish.  I would definitely recommend this movie to either fans of fu-flicks, or to students of martial arts or Eastern philosophy.  While the fights are not great, they're far from bad, and the story is interesting and well done.  With just a bit of tightening up, this might've been a classic.

5981330,2,B00FEHCQYW,"I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan from way back, long before The Matrix movies. Partly because he was so handsome in his youth and is still very attractive as a middle aged man, partly because he chose interesting and different stories when he first started out and even after The Matrix franchise hit big he still chose interesting and sometimes supporting roles in small films, and partly because he can act; his strength has always been under-acting, perfect for film, which captures every nuance. His directorial effort is a decent debut, though I didn't particularly care for the slow motion fight scene at the end or the music throughout. And the villain and his organization needed to be re-evaluated and more effectively presented.

Keanu gives us the man of Tai Chi, a young, humble, modest, nice guy (Tiger), a good son who has a great Tai Chi master but is manipulated into fighting for money to help his family/master. He comes to the attention of the evil Keanu Reeves character and is pulled into a faux villainous fight club franchise, all hot air stereotypes with rich, bored people. There are so many truly evil people, governments, etc., that films needn't give us these unbelievable villains, but likely those with power wouldn't really like to be shown as dastardly in movies so films give us cartoon villains that are laughable stereotypes. ugh. The weakness in this story by far are the villains, which Keanu represent: ultra rich and bored, who apparently want more dead people in a world already swimming in death, which makes absolutely no sense at all.

Tiger, though, is a decent hero, someone you can root for, and his master tries to help him and eventually Tiger gets it, and wins the ultimate battle.

This is a fight movie so there are many fights. I don't care for fights so I pretty much fast forwarded past them. It's just lots of fake movie fighting, with obvious gravity-defying wire work. When this type of fighting first appeared in movies, it was interesting, now it is not. The fights aren't poorly done here, it's just that after you've seen a few of them they all look alike to me.

The acting is good. The man playing Tiger is good, the man playing his master is good. Keanu makes a decent villain, though as I said, the villain and his group don't really work for me. How Tiger defeats Keanu, using some sort of magic (Tai Chi) isn't explained well. Perhaps it is understandable to people who practice Tai Chi but as most audience members wouldn't know Tai Chi, writer needed to do more work showing what it is and demonstrating it's advantages over other types of fighting. In other words, as this is a fight movie, then really show the nuts and bolts of fighting: explain the different styles, why people are interested and what it does for them. This film is analogous to a cooking film where there are lots of cooks competing for a prize (their lives) but we don't see them buying the ingredients, prepping or cooking, we just see the finished products, with the judge awarding the prize, but not explaining why. Now in this example, cooks in the audience might be able to follow the action, but non-cooks would be lost. That's what The Man of Tai Chi feels like to me. As someone who knows nothing about different fight styles, and as this film insists on being a fight movie, would've been very nice if the writer and filmmaker had taken the time to explain the core of the movie. Not knowing about fighting, it's like the film is in a language I do not understand.

It was nice seeing modern China, even down to the smog and traffic jams. Wish more of the movie had shown how ordinary Chinese people live; wish they'd shown Tiger's apartment, it would've been nice to see what Tiger could afford in modern day China on a courier's salary; also would've been nice to see his parents home, and what they were able to achieve by late middle age. Action does take place on some of those sets (we see the family sitting down for dinner), but the sets are not really shown. Would've loved to see their bathrooms or kitchens, to compare the differences in my country and theirs. would've loved to see Tiger's mom shop for, prepare and cook the evening meal for her family, instead of having them all sit down and eat it. Would've been nice to see a Chinese market, something most world citizens would never expect to visit themselves because of the high cost of travel. Women's work gives basic information as to how a society functions, and had the mother's simple preparation of a meal been shown, the audience would've been provided alot of information about modern Chinese society.

Tiger at his day job is believable, with his hop-to-it boss.

Stereotypical villain: slick, uber luxurious toys including cars, a jet, a helicopter, no real sense of the villain's life or the lives of the customers paying to see these fights: they are presented superficially as stereotypical rich, bored people. With so much going on in the world, could've presented a much more frightening and relevant group of villains.

The police are presented pretty typically with a dedicated officer versus her corrupt supervisor. With over a billion people in a society and no doubt lots of criminal activity, kinda hard to believe an officer would fixate on an underground millionaire fight club. It begs the question why? The story shows that the officer had promised the victim she'd deal with the problem and then he disappears. Why does the officer feel such a strong desire to focus on this fight club? Would've been good had the writer shown a connection between the officer and the man who disappeared. Made him a long time family friend perhaps. Anything that explained her dedication to this particular case. Merely that she promised him to solve the case is not strong enough motivation, especially considering that she is going against her direct supervisor's orders and therefore risking her job, something many people would not do. Why then is she willing to do so?

Because the hero is sympathetic, is fighting for a good cause, and has a demonstrable skill set; and because the villain murders with impunity [(though I found it odd and somewhat unbelievable that the Keanu character stabs the first guy to death, which would be very messy: would he, the top guy, risk getting his suit bloody? wouldn't he delegate the stabbing to an underling?)], puts out a hit on an officer, and corrupts another, the story works on a basic level of good versus evil, but pretty creakily, as the villains are so poorly developed.  The lead's acting is solid, and everyone else's acting is solid, so give film 2 and 1/2 stars. Fans of oriental fight films are the audience most likely to enjoy the story I think.

P.S. How to fix the problems in this movie.

Major problem: villains. Okay, alot more time needed to be spent storywise on the Keanu Reeves character and his fight club. Why in the world would a handsome, forty something, obviously very wealthy man spend his time operating an exclusive fight club? Is the club the source of his wealth? Is he addicted to violence? Is he on drugs? If he's into bringing this type of programming to rich people, what motivates him? Is he the sole owner? What does he get out of it? Does he have family? What do they think? Is he insane? How does he run his business? How does he get more customers? What do the customers get? How much do they pay to view the action? Why would they pay anything to watch this type of programming? Answering these questions would've provided a depth and richness to the story, not to mention providing basic information which would've helped the story make sense, and was sorely missing. Answering these questions would have made this film an entirely different and superior viewing experience than was presented.

The filmmakers could've cut half the fight scenes and concentrated on the business side of the fight club, the nuts and bolts, and if the writer explained it logically, at least the villains would not have been stereotypes. Stereotypes just mean the writer failed to give enough believable and relateable information about these particular villains.

In my opinion, a story belongs to the villain, but it is sold to the audience through the hero/heroine. The villain's villainy must be a recognizable threat in the audience's reality, and this film meets that criteria by having Keanu arrange a hit on a cop and unnecessarily murdering several fighters, merely because they lost a battle. If the villain's motivation isn't shown/explained, the story makes no sense, no matter how sympathetic the hero. This story should've been approached entirely differently. It could still have been called The Man of Tai Chi, but by properly showing who the villains are and the depths of their evil, Tiger's killing their leader would've been a real achievement instead of the superficial success presented here. Why the villains make the specific choices they do in this particular story must seem logical to the audience. So a certain amount of time must be set aside in the story to show/explain their goals and who is frustrating them and why they are willing to go the extra mile of murder to get what they want. What do these murders mean to them? What do they hope to achieve by murdering their own fighters? Showing bizarre behavior, without explaining it in a comprehensible manner, doesn't help your audience understand your story.

The approach to the story needed to be re-evaluated. If the writer had just shown why the villains behaved the way that they do, in a way that made sense to the audience, it would've boosted this story from slightly below average to B+.  Presenting the fight club as a business would've strengthened the story.

To illustrate what I mean, look at the film Taken. We have evil slavers kidnapping young women, but the movie focuses on the nuts and bolts of the kidnapping ring as a business: we are shown several ways the kidnappers snatch their victims, and by extension, we can infer that any young, slim, attractive woman in the real world would be at risk if she crossed these monsters's path; we see how the slavers control the slaves, i.e., drugs, chains and violence; we are shown the various levels of their business model: the street walker, the drugged women rented to men at a construction site - the slaves there are an employee perk for the male workers and these ordinary construction employees know the women are strung out, but these modern men do not care enough to report this evil to the authorities; no, instead there is a long line of men waiting their turn to rape with impunity. This shows how strong the demand is. We are shown high end virgin slaves going to the highest bidder. And the police allowing all this to happen, even though the young women and/or their parents are tax payers and pay the police to protect society, and by extension, their daughters. But the police in this story can get more money from the slavers, so they disavow their duty and are corrupted.

A story is a proof. In Taken we see supply and demand, and total disrespect/devaluation of women sex slaves and the men who take advantage of them for profit and pleasure. This is the business model and it is proven in Taken. The story demonstrates how the villains capture slaves, how they are able to get away with it (drugging victims, corrupting officers), and why they do it (demand). What is the business model of The Man of Tai Chi? Why are the villains doing what they are doing? How does it benefit them to murder fighters who lose their battles?

In The Man of Tai Chi the villains make no sense. Their business, their organization, is not clearly shown, and showing it is the responsibility of the writer and filmmakers. The audience cannot make it up for them.

To improve this story, the writer/filmmakers needed to understand who their villains are and what motivates them. After that, they needed to give this information in dramatic form to us. Had the film team done so, they would've significantly increased the quality of their story. You can't ignore your villain. He/she drives almost everything in the story - they are the engine. The hero/heroine basically does clean up, aka stopping the villain(s). The hero/heroine gets the glory, but without an understandable villain doing vile things, the hero/heroine has nothing to do. In this story, the villain does vile things, but why, and to what end, isn't demonstrated, and so the Keanu character makes no sense, and Tiger's defeat of him means little. Hopefully in Keanu's next directing project the villain will be developed more fully.",1397952000,,12648,4.753530751708428

5981334,3,B00FEHCQYW,"Man of Tai Chi is a 2013 Chinese-American martial arts film directed by Keanu Reeves.  Starring Keanu's real-life trainer Tiger Chen, it tells the story of a Tai Chi student bent on proving this style is more than just exercise - it's combat capable.

The storyline is a little tired.  Tiger initially is working his way through the tournament circuit to showcase his theory but is soon approached by Donaka, the proprietor of an elegant, spectator-driven blood sport, and is offered a position in this world.  Tiger's first reaction is to decline, advising that fighting for money isn't the Tai Chi way, but quickly changes his tune once the government threatens to commandeer his master's training temple in the mountains over its fire danger from disrepair.  He has thirty days to get it fixed and this, you understand, is expensive.  Cue the fight contract.  I don't need to see anymore films where people have x-amount of days to come up with x-amount of funds.  There are better ways to invoke heroics and passion in a protagonist, especially in the martial arts genre.  That being said, the relationship between Tiger and his master played out well and for that I'll give the writers a little credit.

The cinematography is solid and enjoyable.  This is a crisp film and houses some neat little bursts of original Chinese cityscape shots and environment ambiance, especially the fight locations - they were gorgeous.  Were it not for the camerawork, I'd have spent the duration of Keanu's project staring off listlessly in between fight scenes.  This carried a lot of the slack left behind by this shrug of a script and I was thankful for it.

The acting performances were so-so.  I think Tiger did a fine job and I look forward to seeing his future works, but Keanu was dead weight and it made the movie awkward.  Per usual, this is just another Keanu performance where Keanu is being Keanu and it was dissatisfying from top to bottom.  He's stony and surly here, glaring throughout every scene and pushing his lines out as if they've some resistant MASS to them.  This is obviously my amateurish opinion - I'm only a basement den movie watcher - but the dude reads one note and it's been that way for a long time.  But some folks love Keanu and they'll probably love him here, too.  He's just not my cup of tea.

The fight scenes were good.  Not great, but worth watching, no doubt.  Tai Chi is beautiful on its own and the sparring sessions between Tiger and Master Yang were invigorating to watch.  As the film progresses the fights, of course, become incrementally more difficult for Tiger and he's tasked with sorting out a variety of styles to succeed against.  Paralleling this climb is a slight nudge in the superhuman elements of martial arts.  The bodies thrown start showing that wire-line, in-air loft and it becomes a bit unrealistic, but not egregiously so.  I'd have preferred that it not dip into that realm of unbelievability but again, it didn't go too far.  I'd recommend the film on these battles alone - they're absolutely worth a rental.  Good stuff.

In the end, though, as a whole, I was underwhelmed.  Man of Tai Chi is pushing two hours and a good chunk of that is spent following arcs that didn't excite me.  There's some quiet semblance of a romance and we follow a detective, (Karen Mok - haven't seen her in awhile), as she pursues the sport criminally, neither of which threw hooks at me.  But this is, at the end of the day, a fight film and in THAT arena, I think it does enough to garner a sit-down.  I wouldn't recommend buying the film as the replay value, for me anyway, wasn't there.  I'd rent it first.

5981352,5,B00FEHCQYW,"Man Of Tai Chi is a superior criminal underworld/undergroud fighting club action movie that also has some unusual undercurrents going on.  Tiger Chen plays the sole student of the last master of a highly potent form of martial arts Tai Chi, who is lured by a businessman/ultra-elite underground fight tournament owner Keanu Reaves (who also directed) into a path of increasingly dangerous contests and increasing personal darkness  Reaves's character's legitimate business is security, and so he has tie-ins to all kinds of personal, corporate and government-owned surveillance cameras, security systems, electric eyes, etc.; they even have devices planted in the televisions, etc. of persons thet're interested in, such as Chen, and their family members.  All this gives the organization a really sinister, 'omnipresent' feel, which helps lead in to a running undercurrent I'll get to in a minute.

The action is outstanding, even by the high norms of Asian action movies, and the production is sleek and visually powerful.  There are good subplots involving the growing estrangement between Chen and his mentor, and involving the Chinese police's efforts to crack the organization, who they know of in detail but can prove nothing, and can't move against with so many powerful, big-money people involved.

It's in the organization and in Reaves's character that we find possibly the most intriguing subplot.  Aside from it being obvious that it has far more money and resources than you'd expect from your average mob-run fight club, the true motivations beyond what they're doing seem to go deeper than just the fights, and deeper than the explanation given before one of the big events about three quarters of the way in.  Buried between the lines are, to my interpretation, clues that the organization's hierarchy is looking for a lot more than just the next big draw to their shows, and also (I hope I'm not giving anything away, but this seemed evident to me from early on) that there seems to be a strange, even inhuman aspect to Reaves and at least one of his higher henchmen.  It's a fascinating angle with lots of possibilities, but even without it this is a first-rate, dramatic modern-day Chinese martial arts movie, deserving of a far bigger audience than what it seems to have gotten so far, and surpassing my expectations.",1393113600,,2338,5.099476439790576
5981353,2,B00FEHCQYW,"The basic story elements are there for a good story, but the execution falls flat.  The basic story is a modern take on 80's kung fu movies.  A young expert martial artist (Chen Lin-Hu) is torn between two masters.  One master is good and one is evil (Reeves).  Reeves wants to corrupt young Tiger into an underground fight club killer.  The problem for me is that I didn't quite believe Tiger's descent into temptation because the movie did an inadequate job setting up need, doubt, and desire in Tiger to start the movie.  We see he lives a quiet and frugal life, but not that he is discontent with it or that he desires something more.  Reeve's only leverage into corrupting Chen is through the temple Chen studied in.  The movie doesn't do enough to delve into Chen's inner conflicts.  That could have made a huge difference in the movie.  Further, Reeves character is flat and uninteresting.  He isn't an archetype villain, he is a stereotype.  I expected so much more from an actor of his caliber.  Ultimately, the central crisis that Chen must make falls flat and thus the climax falls flat. I think that is mainly because the lack of internal character development in Chen.  This movie could have been so much deeper if they had taken a few more minutes to develop Chen's conflict, Reeve's character, and perhaps a direct confrontation between masters (Darth Vader vs. Obi Wan type thing).

That said, there is much to enjoy.  The fight sequences are fun and I thought it did a good job of mixing Chinese and English.  The fighting didn't rely much on mythic martial arts things like flying or running on water or walking up walls.  If you liked fighting sequences from old Kung Fu movies or the Matrix, you are bound to enjoy them here.  Tiger Hu Chen is a bright face on the screen and I look forward to seeing more of him in future movies.

In the end, it isn't really a well told story, but does have good fight sequences.",1393113600,,1934,4.534682080924855

Bad acting, bad writing, bad special effects, bad camera angles, bad fight choreography, bad technique. It may have made my kung fu worse by watching. I want my money back.

5981357,2,B00FEHCQYW,"Keanu Reeves, in his directing debut, attempts to tell a compelling story of struggle and redemption, but the plot is so choppy that it comes of as a second rate Chinese film, which is exactly what it is. You want to believe that this has the epic martial arts battles of The Matrix, but it falls way short and gets tapped out in the first round. It had potential but the storyline fails to be compelling and is over simplistic. The acting feels more like a Kung fu movie of old and the characters switch from English and Chinese in mid-sentence leaving the viewer more impressed with their fluency than their life stories or current problem.",1392422400,,642,4.543103448275862

Sets and costumes were nice as well. I did wish that we saw more of some of the main attractions to the film, but I understand how it had to be so, due to the films story. I was happy to see Tiger and Keanu do this together since they were in the Matrix. Glad I have it now in Blu-Ray now, too. I wish It was in theaters for us to see it as it was intended to be watched but due to limited release, I could not.

5981360,4,B00FEHCQYW,"K. Reeves shows here he's a martial arts movie fan who has followed and studied the genre. The story is something old and nothing new and who cares? There's fight scene after fight scene, most of them pretty good though Keanu looks and sounds overworked and slow here, maybe because he directed it. In that regard, directing, he did well. Anyway, Chen Hu is pretty amazing, a good lead; and it's always good to see the great Yu Hai. Karen Mok does her job, I like watching her, she handles her role clearly. Martial arts movie fans will have plenty to enjoy and bits to denigrate. Simon Yam is a pleasure to watch though his part is small so you might find yourself hoping he shows up in the tale pretty soon when things start to teeter. The film is well edited, clearly trying not to waste any unnecessary time on story continuity and I thought they managed it very well. If you want high drama, sensitive portrayals, clever dialogue, this isn't your movie, or your genre though all such things can happen now and then in a martial arts movie it's not why folks watch 'em. Reeves knows why we watch 'em and he's tried to give us what we want. For a first time directing he did very well.",1392249600,,1188,4.380090497737557

Where to start with the disappointments on this one? KR's acting is none existent.  One liners throughout the whole movie in the same not-so-tough guy monotone without any emotion/expression. TRITE. Reminded me of a 5 year old trying to play tough guy.  I think there were 2 scenes where he managed two sentences in a row (with complete structure).  It seems most people loved this movie for the fight scenes?  Really?!?!?!? I've seen old Jean Claude movies with better fight scenes. None compared to ""KF Hustle"" and I don't list that movie among the greats.

I would say watch this for mindless entertainment, but you would have to leave out the entertainment.  So I guess just watch this if you are mindless.",1391990400,,845,4.707482993197279
5981363,5,B00FEHCQYW,"Keanu Reeves is infamous among movie fans for his dual nature: his mainstream career is built on a foundation of 1-note dudebro heroes, yet he spends almost all his free time, and vast piles of his own cash, on indie efforts that his most vocal detractors never even see. He is, in other words, unafraid to invest himself back in filmmaking. So the news that he was taking his stuntman buddy Tiger Chen, going to China, and making a movie actually didn't seem totally weird.

Man of Tai Chi is thankfully less like Reeves' past vehicles and more a synthesis of his indi work and Chinese crime thrillers of the early 2000s. Tiger Chen plays a character named Tiger Chen, a courier by day and Tai Chi practitioner on the weekends. Chen is the sole inheritor of his unique Tai Chi style and plans to represent its power as a martial art in an ongoing televised tournament, to the displeasure of his master who feels that philosophy, not fighting, is the important part of Tai Chi.

Chen is courted by the mysterous Donaka Mark, played by Reeves, the wealthy and saturnine president of a powerful private security firm. Mark hires Chen to fight a series of underground martial arts matches for a private audience. At first reluctant, Chen enjoys the money the fights bring, as well as the chance to test his growing martial arts prowess without limits. However, the fights  become more brutal, and Chen becomes violent and distant, alienating his friends and being expelled from his tournament. After Chen's newfound brutality forces his master to repulse him with a painful chi strike during sparring, he walks away from his school and becomes a full-time underground fighter. Predictably things go South, and it all wraps up with Mark and Chen facing off in a battle not just of fists but of ideology.

Thematically, the film walks familiar ground but it does so very competently. The cinematography and East-meets-West feel are similar to the Wachowski's Ninja Assassin, but while that was a fantasy movie with a few scattered real elements, MoTC is a realistic movie with a few carefully applied fantastic elements. Reeves makes for a bad guy who is sharklike, heartless, and physically intimidating- the perfect foreign devil antagonist to Chen's boyish easygoing Chinese everyman. Special attention also goes to the location shots which pick out modern China in its gigantic, smoggy, sprawling glory and further the latter-day Hong Kong blockbuster feel. And of course Chen is a professional martial artist and stuntman, so all the fights are top notch.

Overall Man of Tai Chi is an amazingly solid first directorial effort supported by a capable cast that will scratch many a cinematic itch, from old-school Hong Kong crime thriller, to classic brawler action, to new-wave martial-arts art cinema. Of the many films emerging from the new era of US/Chinese film collusion, this one easily makes the best of its heritage, producing a movie with a truly international feel and top notch values in all production areas.

PROS
-Tiger Chen does amazing stuff with just a little fun fluff thrown in
-Shot like a BAWS
-Old-meets-new directorial feel (kind of like Iron Man 3 really)

CONS
-Final fight between Reeves and Chen kind of has to stretch to make Reeves seem like a match for Chen
-Some plot loops come in and just don't matter",1391990400,,3333,4.8780918727915195
5981364,5,B00FEHCQYW,"I was very surprised to see how well this movie came out. Keanu Reeves shows his age in this, but none the less it was well made. Tiger Chen has been turning heads for some time now and I'm glad he was able to do it on the American stage.

He just does not have that powerful snap when he kicks.  As far as the Tiger character is concerned, why did they choose an unattractive guy with a terrible haircut?

This movie definitely has many superb fighting acts.  For that, martial art fans will enjoy the film.

After watching this movie, I couldn't help but wonder if an Aikido black belt can beat a Tai Chi master?",1391904000,,537,4.428571428571429
5981367,4,B00FEHCQYW,"I bought this disc for the high quality blu ray picture and it does not disappoint.  The movie is awesome and for Keanu's directorial debut, he picked a FANTASTIC story, brilliant choreography by Master Yuen Woo Ping and of course a great hero in Tiger Chen. Karen Mok is also great as the lady cop , she was the ugly girl who made bouncing shrimp meatballs in that Stephen Chow movie God of Cookery. You might want to check that out if you like the mixture of chinese food and stupid physical comedy.

The music soundtrack is great! Lighting, camera moves and special effects are superb!  Wire removal mostly.  favorite fight is the first tie fight with Tiger wearing a suit thinking he's going to a job interview for the evil Donaka Mark (Keanu). I love love love the leg sweeps in that fight, and that his necktie seems to be made out of spandex because it stretches out to a ridiculous 45cm!

I won't give this disc 5 stars because I am utterly flummoxed why the bonus extras are truly rubbish! There is a teeny interview with Keanu and then a Director's Commentary with Keanu and Tiger,  but this is a really bad commentary. It's not like a commentary from Ridley Scott where he explains everything from casting to set design. Keanu just kinda goes, ""Ah yeah, this is my favorite bit.""
 It's a cop out commentary if you ask me.

I'm also disappointed because there IS a documentary on youtube which shows you the entire Making of Man of Tai Chi from interviews with the stunt coordinator, the DP, the writer, even Master Woo Ping. There's hours and hours worth of stuff from premieres, press junkets, film festivals, chat shows...all kinds! For a chinese-american action film directed by a Hollywood actor in which people speak English, cantonese and Mandarin simultaneously,  you'd think they could put out a better product than this!!!
Yeah I could just watch them on youtube but I actually LIKE watching docos on the same disc! And I feel that this film is just the start of things to come for Keanu as a director so why not put EVERYTHING you got on the disc???!!??",1391817600,,2074,4.583783783783784

The plot is not going to wow anyone.  Think Bloodsport or Best of the Best done poorly with today's camera work, technology, etc.  It's been done.

The subtitles flash on and off a bit too fast.  It is annoying to be reading and watching simultaneously.  You miss facial expressions, settings, action, etc.

This is mostly a foreign movie.  If you enjoy peeking into Chinese-American filmmaking, go for it.  For me, it is an annoying B movie with subtitles.  NOT a winner by any gauge.

Tho what I will give him is his debut on directing tho you could pick out a few faults but overall for a first directional movie he really pulled it off with the choreography,  fight scenes were all nicely executed.

5981417,3,B00FEHCQYW,"Keanu Reeves through his long career from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure to the upcoming 47 Ronin has developed a love for martial arts especially with his experience in the Matrix films, so no surprise that Reeves has chosen a martial arts film has his directorial debut. Plus the Man of Tai Chi isn't a safe risk for the actor turned director with the film having nothing extravagant in story telling or effects, and it pays off for Reeves as the Man of Tai Chi is a fun enjoyable martial arts film.

The Man of Tai Chi opens with Donaka Mark (Played wonderfully by Reeves whom I enjoyed as a playing a villain.) viciously stabbing, and killing his own fighter who refused to finish off his opponent he had defeated, and telling his associate to find another fighter. Enter Tiger Chen Linhu (Tiger Chen) a delivery man who has no direction in life outside of Tai Chi. Tiger's desire to prove himself, and show the world that Tai Chi is more than just meditation and defense which is at odds from his master's teachings as he forbids Tai Chi to be used in violence. Entering a tournament Tiger Chen proves himself, and catches the eye of Mark who offers Chen money, and the chance to prove himself in real fights with no referees or rules. Through the brutal fights Mark turns Chen from a rudderless nave delivery man into an emotionless fighting machine on the verge of becoming a heartless killer, which was Donaka Mark's plan all along as his only desire was turning, and watching an innocent man being turned into a killer.

Man of Tai Chi's script written by Michael G. Cooney simplistic basically verging on a B level film in storytelling, and it shows with the side plot of Hong Kong detective Sun Jing Shi's (Karen Mok) quest to capture Mark, but the script is effective in the type of film Reeves is directing. With nothing complex or any real deeper meaning with the story Reeves could have fun with the Man of Tai Chi, and Reeves does playing Donaka Mark with glee, and it was entertaining to see Reeves play a villain with dialog like """"You owe me a life!"". Through the Matrix films Reeves became a good friend to fight chorographer Tiger Chen who has been involved in many films fights from the Kill Bill films to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and I can understand that Reeves wanted to showcase his friend's skill on film, but he charisma or screen presence. Outside of the martial arts scenes Tiger Chen is an emotionless robot, and it is understandable as Man of Tai Chi is his first starring role, but the lack of emotion especially in the scenes that require Tiger Chen to show genuine emotion lack it taking away need depth to the film and character. While I know that Tiger Chen is a skilled martial artist I think another actor should have been cast in the leading role.

The star of Man of Tai Chi is obviously the martial arts on display, and Reeves displays he eye for detail and understanding of martial arts films. With martial art films the fighting can get repetitive and stale with one fight scene resembling the one before. This happens to almost all martial art films, director Reeves does a good job keeping the fights riveting and fresh with his eye for detail, and his knowledge of the type of films, and of course the advice of his friend Tiger Chen. Reeves keeps the fights generally fresh changing fight locations as well as different types of fights including an exciting two on one battle on a freighter, and bringing in skilled martial art actors including Iko Uwais who many will recognize from The Raid: Redemption, and whom I think would have fit better in the leading role than Chen.

Through his career Reeves has been criticized for bland acting ability and facial expressions as the actor works best in action roles like the Matrix films, and Speed or the Bill and Ted films playing characters who are dimwitted or characters with no emotional complexities or depth, so maybe Reeves can more acclaim as a director, much like Ben Affleck has in transforming an average and criticized acting career into an acclaimed career as a director. Whether Reeves can mimic Affleck or not the Man of Tai Chi is a quality start for actor turned director. While the story is very flawed as well as the acting from Tiger Chen, director Reeves does a very good job acting himself, and directing complex martial art scenes to create a film that celebrates Tai Chi, and is entertaining to boot.",1389052800,,4428,4.615482233502538
5981418,4,B00FEHCQYW,"This one is more in the vain of a Bruce Lee type flick. Keanu is pretty monotone throughout the flick, but this movie really isn't about him. It's actually about a Tai Chi student who wants people to take the style seriously as a practical fighting form, and who, as the movie progresses, finds himself at odds with the basic tenets of Tai Chi even as he utilizes its physical teachings in incredibly violent ways. Eventually, he comes full circle and truly grasps what Tai Chi is really about, finding the man he is supposed to be in the process.
I thought this was a very interesting film, and from a visual aesthetic, you won't be disappointed in the way the fight scenes play out. Well worth a viewing in my estimation.",1389052800,,723,4.484848484848484

5981420,3,B00FEHCQYW,"If you're a fan of the martial arts genre there's enough here to keep you interested. It's got all the classic themes. The teacher and the student, the unique fighting style, the struggling Shaolin-type temple the meek but talented student. Then, all of a sudden the movie turns into a mesh of The Karate Kid, Enter The Dragon, and The Matrix. There are some decent fight scenes here but the movie suffers from what feels like an attempt to improve upon something that doesn't need to be fixed. Listen, the thing that has always made the martial arts genre great is the stories don't really have to be all that complex. All you really need is a basic explanation for why this guy has decided to beat up everyone he comes in contact with. What? They killed your teacher?  Huh? They killed your brother?...no way...destroyed the temple, the village,...hey whatever...just go and beat them up in as many imaginative ways possible. If you don't have a great story like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ip Man, Kill Bill etc;...just give us the action, it's all we really care about. There's no need to fix what ain't broken. I give this three stars because it had some decent action but Keanu Reeves character was completely unbelievable. Personally, I find it a bit insulting when people from other countries portray themselves as dominant experts of a discipline that originates with a culture other than their own. You'll either love it or hate it.",1389052800,,1446,4.784
5981421,1,B00FEHCQYW,"This was not a movie, just the telling of a story using many 15 or 20 second scenes, seemingly disconnected as well.",1388966400,,116,4.318181818181818
5981422,3,B00FEHCQYW,"Tiger is a great character, and his acting is good and inviting. The relationship between Tiger and his Tai Chi Master is the most engaging element in this film's narrative. Sadly, Keanu's strange evil character ruins much of the tension between Tiger and Master, and the movie becomes awkwardly isolated around Tiger's relationship with Keanu while the Master becomes too little a side character for my tastes. Nonetheless, the scenes between Tiger and his Master are the BEST in the movie; these offer fantastically choreographed fights that exemplify the beauty and fluidity of combat Tai Chi. Sadly, Tai Chi's beautiful prowess does not carry over to the other fight scenes, nor do any other characters really pull the viewer into caring nearly as much as the Master.

Keanu (as the director) eschews the powerful drama between Tiger and the Master in favor of a cut-and-dry relationship between Tiger and Keanu's character (I don't even remember this character's name, that's how boring the main villian is).

Understand that this movie is intended for two audiences, Chinese and English speakers, so you can't really ask for (nor expect) highly developed dialogue. Still, Keanu's lines are miserably blunt and monotone (basically, he says ""im evil"" every time he speaks: we get it.) This movie does not flatter Keanu's acting, to say the least.

After the first few battles, the fights not between Tiger and Master are not noteworthy. Tiger stops using very cool Tai Chi (This is understandable at times, since the point of the stories progression is that Tiger loses himself to anger, thus losing grasp of Tai Chi, but this is not shown as well as it could have been), when this is the case, the fight scenes devolve into bland kung-fu chaos that we've seen 1000 times and certainly did not entertain me. The directing in these scenes become painfully obvious, and fictional world we've been pulled into begins to break down.

The end fight between Keanu and Tiger is boring, don't expect anything great. The Tai Chi move Tiger eventually uses (which is supposed to be the climax of the movie) was showcased much more poignantly and beautifully by his Master when they fought each other earlier in the film.

Keanu's villian is the symbol of an American type of greed, wickedness, and general evilness, while Tiger is the symbol of a secular Chinese hero who overcomes American strength with ""better"" Chinese strength that is not evil nor greedy. This east-west propaganda is too black-and-white and so ruins the narrative power of the main villian.

I am not upset that they made an american guy evil, I am upset they made the villian boringly evil, so obviously so that it is ridiculous and evidence of mediocre directing and a confused screenplay. I want to see more fights like the ones with Tiger and his Master, those show how awesome Tai Chi really is!

Man of Tai Chi is worth watching for those few scenes where Tiger's martial ability is incredible and the Tai Chi moves feel new and very exciting. Everything else is filler and narrative garbage.",1388880000,12,3064,4.903474903474904

It had some pretty intense fight scenes, but there was a bit too much wire work at times. I would rather see ""pure"" fight choreography for the most part, and if you are going to do any truly superhuman stuff, make it understated (and not obviously fake).

The plot was so-so, but pretty typical of the source material.

This whole film could have happened without Keanu Reeve's character and the matrix like environment that he seems to have been geared towards. The movie is good at parts, but very far from good at others. The story makes sense.. up to a point. After which it kind of comes off as Keanu Reeve's ego getting in the way of crafting a good movie.

My gripes:
The physics. I understand that this is a kung fu movie, but it's ridiculous to see someone kick someone else into the air and then pull them back down by their leg like they weight 5 pounds so that they can keep beating up on them.

Keanu Reeves. I love the Matrix. It is one of my favorite films, ever. However, that was the Matrix. Keanu Reeve's appears to have put himself in this movie because he was directing it and nobody would say no. I wouldn't have minded it if he did a good job, but it's pretty obvious that nobody was telling him when he needed to not do a morpheus impression and that he should focus on being the character that he was supposed to be.

The Plot. Starts strong and and ends with the question ""What was the point of that?"" The main plot is at least consistent, but the incentives and the subplots are so muddled that they make no sense.

The Good stuff:
The premise: This was actually pretty cool. I was hoping for more, but the idea behind the movie was actually a good one. However, it loses focus about halfway through and the end leaves you with some questions about character's incentives.

The martial arts: There are some ridiculous scenes, but it's good when they are doing legitimate martial arts. The pace is fast and the moves are very impressive.

In Summary:
I liked the trailers for this movie and bought it against my better judgement. I regret the purchase because I will probably never see this movie again. If you are extremely curious about this film, then I would suggest renting it at Redbox. In my opinion it's not worth the money to purchase. However, this does show a promising start for Reeve's career as a Director. The filming is done better than you would expect, and while it seems like the first draft of a production that got rushed to its final stages of editing, it shows that if Reeve's takes Directing seriously he can produce some worthwhile films.. If he allows himself to.",1387238400,,2431,4.451685393258427

Different scenarios present themselves and, although some are typical, others are unexpected.

Don't expect any major work of art if that is what floats your boat.  The photography is well done and the directing stays true to the plot.  The older he gets the more impressed I become with Keanu Reeves and how he approaches his craft.

5981478,1,B00FEHCQYW,"This movie is bad in every aspect

The fighting scenes look stiff and choppy compared to other kung fu movies starring Jet Li, or Donnie Yen.  Probably, it is because of the directing, editing and cinematography. The fighting In the Matrix, starring Keanu Reeveses, looks much smoother and more interesting.

It contains a little bit of kung fu's philosophy but it is skin-deep and it has been used so many times before.

The dialogue is kept to a minimum and it is bland.

The acting is wooden.

According to Wikipedia dot org, its production budget is USD $25 million.
According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie:

Release Date: November 1, 2013
Domestic:  $100,144

But the owner is driving a 2 million dollar car... All to ""perhaps"" see his last fight and what he might do in light of his evolving downfall in character... It's so dumb. I won't go into all the other numerous holes (or bad writing) in this plot... There are many. It had some good fight scenes and decent action besides watching a tall, awkward KR trying to do kung fu. KR was acting was just bad and expected because he directed -- no one there to tell him how bad it is.

for Keanu Reeves, he is not the central character. His character seemed
to be intentionally a man of few words. It works for him.

The back story is ok, no different than many action movies. There is a
fair portion of the movie in action sequences, which was (were) done very well.

Subtitling (in the English version) is not a problem, they only translate
some of the Mandarin to English sub-titles. The movie was shot with
English spoken for the most part.

So, bottom line, I liked it. I watched it in HD streaming, the picture was

It is a sadistic perversion of what is supposed to be a pure practice of a martial arts venue. I was tremendously put off by the ""kill scenes"", and even more put off by Keanu Reeves as the soul-less hunter of candidates to pit against each other - to the death. This is to me, a perversion of the ""Savior Neo"" from ""The Matrix""...as it borrows heavily from that character regarding his manner of dress and aggressive fighting personality. Not what I want to see as a follow up. I stopped watching it after a point. I don't enjoy seeing - even in a movie - beating someone to death, with that being the only motivation and goal.

It looked as though you were wearing a back brace the entire time. After a movie full of some pretty cool fighting scenes to end with that crap was pitiful. The Matrix was a long time ago bud, let it go.

The movie really had it going throughout, even though if it was a martial arts ripoff of Star Wars and Anakin's transformation to Vader.....complete with a slightly taller and white skinned Master Yoda. I jest, but in all seriousness it reminded me of Star Wars. Still it was doing a good job of character development with Tiger and I was enjoying the story and interested to see where it went. When it got there I was pretty disgusted. The final fight scene was painful to watch. If only Keanu could have found a way to end this better.

- Good fight scenes (albeit, the final fight between Donaka and Tiger had much to be desired - it wasn't as realistic as the other scenes)
- Nice Kung-Fu choreography (particularly Tiger's practice time at the Temple)
- Cute girl (yeah, Tiger's girlfriend was kind of cute)
- Reasonable price, at only US$12.99

5981525,5,B00FEHCQYW,"This is possibly one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time that draws the parallel of choices, consequences and motivations.

Tiger Chen is an innocent that begins to walk a path far different from his master's and it all began with one small choice...

The opportunities to make wise or unwise choices compound and the viewer get's to see first hand in accelerated fashion the power of choices and motivations; truth verses deception and the hard path verses the easy one.

The visuals of this movie were outstanding, the casting was sound and the ability to hold the viewer's attention were all definite wins for this picture.

While I would have liked the entire film to be in English verses some subtitled moments (white subtitles on white screen was sometimes difficult to read) overall the movie transitioned well, got to its point without a lot of needless dialogue and quite frankly, the fight scenes were AWESOME!

Keanu as the bad guy was a very interesting break from the roles of dark hero and protagonist.  His countenance sometimes is almost freakishly morphed (without additional make up or masking mind you) to portray a very convincing evil - and while I have found in his youth some performances a bit wooden, in this his true ability as an actor and director shines.

I gave this one five stars because I am a huge martial arts fan, a movie goer who's pretty tired of getting sex and foul language thrown at them just so I can get a good story and I'm partial to movies that actually have a message tainted with truth and a moral lesson that we all can benefit from.

That said, thanks Keanu - I expected to like this movie (if nothing else but for the fight scenes), not to love it. I have to say, I am SO not disappointed!",1382227200,,1756,4.517350157728707

First, if you're planning on killing the lead detective investigating you, maybe something more sophisticated than a trucker choking might work.  Hands to a gun fight, really?  And lastly, the character played by Reeves is pretty good.  BUT... in the last fight, he's kicking the hell out of our hero and all of a sudden ""magical powers"" wins the fight... awful ending.  I don't care how deep you wanted to go in soul searching, magical endings suck.  In this movie, corruption over innocents would have played better.  Tried too hard to have a happy ending, when a realistic moral ending would have played out.  Sometime people choose money over good...",1382227200,3,734,4.902439024390244
5981527,4,B00FEHCQYW,The fight scenes in the movie were pretty good. The plot was a bit lacking. It was obviously made with a Chinese audience in mind.,1382227200,,130,4.24
5981528,5,B00FEHCQYW,"Was pleasingly surprised that Keeanu directed this story & was pleased by the masterful Tai Chi moves, because I was taught combat Tai Chi, I recommend this movie, both Tiger & Keeanu were excellent!!!",1382227200,,201,4.9411764705882355
5981529,5,B00FEHCQYW,"When I went into Man of Tai Chi, I was expecting a brainless but action-packed, simple-minded by fast-paced action flick. What I got was a brilliantly choreographed, stylishly filmed, brutally hard-hitting martial arts film with a surprising moral fiber.

But to be honest, I went in for the fights. Keanu advertised over 45 minutes of action scenes, and they did NOT disappoint. Choreographed by the *legendary* Yuen Woo-Ping, of Drunken Master, The Matrix, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fame, these fights are realistic, violent, gripping, and surprisingly brutal. Each fight has a different tone and style, and the real highlight for me was to view all the different styles - Tai Chi, Wing Chun, karate, boxing, and more - come together into one glorious flurry of fists, knees, elbows, and feet. Tiger Chen (Chen Hu) has got badassery and style, and in his stunning two-on-one fight in a secret fighting ring on a freighter ship, he showed he has all the skills to become the next Jet Li or Donnie Yen. I see this guy going places.

The supporting cast includes the *fantastic* Iko Uwais (sadly underused), Karen Mok, who exudes control and determination, and a plethora of famous Hong Kong actors that you in the west wouldn't know, but to those living in China (like me), are the equivalent of an all-star Hollywood cast. They act like all Hong Kong actors act - over the top, almost caricaturing themselves, but hey, they get the job done.

Keanu Reeves is over the top in the finest possible way, exuding the kind of villainery that would make a Bond villain jealous. This, if I dare say it, is one of Reeves's best performances. He is a worthy foe, releasing his inner animal brilliantly, into a suave, dangerous, unpredictable baddo. His final fight with Chen should go down in the annals of kung-fu fights as one of the most stunning ever choreographed.

The cons of Man of Tai Chi, however, are too glaring and jarring to ignore. They include that phony type of dialogue and acting that is so popular in Hong Kong soap opera, a lack of emotion, a simpleminded screenplay, and some rote acting from some competitors. But let's face it, we're here for the fights, and director Reeves delivers in spades.

If you like action films, kung-fu films, martial arts movies, or all round stylish, fast-paced, and badass films, you will most likely love Man of Tai Chi. If you are looking for the next The Raid or Drunken Master, look somewhere else. But DON'T give this a miss. 4.5 elbow jabs! Er, stars.

P.S. Did anyone notice the *fantastic* use of music during the fight scenes by Keanu Reeves? Color me impressed, and here's hoping Reeves can make more movies in the future.",1382227200,64,2686,4.765591397849462

5981536,4,B00FEHCQYW,"Excellent fight scenes.  This movie reminded me of Fatal Contact, but not quite as depressing where a nave, good natured martial artist descends into a darker world and his character becomes corrupted.

The film however, does seem to drag in portions of the story.  The reason I give the story three stars is because the film did drag in different portions--there were times I fell asleep.  The action on the other hand, works okay, specifically towards the end when Tiger Hu Chen and Keanu square off.  Would I recommend it?  Somewhat.  As I mentioned earlier, its not as good as the Cohen brothers' Matrix Trilogy, but you can recognize the work in this film.  And I think Keanu took a page from it rather than considering something totally new on his own.",1381795200,,703,4.387596899224806

5981541,4,B00FEHCQYW,"Pretty good Kung Fu movie. The main character is someone I haven't seen before but he plays the role well. Keanu Reeves plays the villain in this one and does a nice job acting until the ending where he has a final battle with the hero (and this fight is an enormous let down in comparison to all the previous fights in the film). The problem is that they didn't choreograph enough and Keanu looks slow as a geezer but it appears the director still thinks he can fight as good as if he was taking on Morpheus or Agent Smith! Uh, no.  While the film is predictable and wanders sometimes, the action is pretty constant, and when you watch a Kung Fu related movie, it's about the fighting!

5981545,4,B00FEHCQYW,"The majority of the movie is pretty close to real straight up fighting between martial artists. Not something you actually see to much, it's not crazy and over-stylized.

Say what you want about Keanu's acting, but the directing side wasn't bad. Yes it is not something new but he did a good job, all the shots are smooth, with only a few questionable ones.

My only real issue I had in the movie was the end fight (it was in the trailers, so I don't believe this is at all a spoiler). Having him fight Keanu at the end like that was important for the story, but that fight compared to any of the others was very lackluster. Just comparatively to all the other martial artists in the movie, watching him fight was not fun at all.",1381622400,,729,4.313868613138686
5981546,5,B00FEHCQYW,"I normally wouldn't have paid to watch this, but this caught my eye and found myself asking is that Keannu on the cover? I see that it has nearly 5 stars, so starting reading reviews and convinced myself why not.

Well I am glad I did, the movie was EXTREMELY entertaining, and I was really into the movie. The story was well done, not super original but enough to keep very entertained. The martial arts are actually really good. Nothing ground breaking but if you are a fan of martial arts you will like this. As for the acting this I believe was actually really good, I really enjoyed Tiger's master performance. Just felt his feelings were real, and when you watch you will know what I mean.

I see this is Keannu's first movie as a director, I actually would look forward to watching more of his movies. The flow of the this movie was well done in my opinion, never slow, never too much.

5981550,4,B00FEHCQYW,"""Man of Tai Chi"" arrived with a great deal of fanfare in my present city of employment this weekend, and I rushed to see it. Is it any good? Well, it plays like an unlikely blend of ""Fight Club"" and ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but if you like chopsocky, this is for you. The action sequences feature a minimum of wire-Fu, and the fight scenes are shot in such a way that you see all the kicks and blows. There's a minimum of blood, but I didn't mind that, especially given that the last film I saw (the abysmal ""No One Lives"") was awash in it. In addition to being kickass, ""Man"" is also a meditation on old and new Hong Kong,  and traditional versus contemporary values, especially as they apply to the gentle art of Tai Chi--and did I mention that it's kickass?

Star Keanu Reeves has been toying with this project since he first met stuntman Tiger Chen on the set of ""The Matrix,"" and the film was five years in development, with a budget of $25 million. Keanu not only stars in but also directs ""Man of Tai Chi,"" and he acquits himself admirably on both counts. He plays a reclusive billionaire (is there any other kind?), who collects Lamborghinis and Bugattis (not to mention a Bentley or two), but who is lacking the one thing in life that would make him happy: a soulless fighter who doesn't object to killing his defeated opponents.

Enter the Tiger!

Great locations in Beijing, Hong Kong, and Macau. Great score by Hong Kong film veteran Chan Kwong-wing. Keanu has done the genre proud.",1381104000,,1489,4.443223443223443
