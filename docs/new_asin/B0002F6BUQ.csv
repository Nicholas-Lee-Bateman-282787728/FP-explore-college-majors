2089087,5,B0002F6BUQ,"this movie isn't the sort of movie you really understand the first time. it is thought-provoking and even though it jumps around a little, it has a very good story. i like all of the different themes that are brought into this movie. and despite the serious tone it seems to carry, there are many points of good humor thrown in. i would recommend this to pretty much anyone who has always wanted more for their lives, but we're just afraid to get it. this is an inspiring film once you reflect on its meanings. if you haven't seen this, you should.",1100822400,4,548,4.382352941176471

8027507,5,B0002F6BUQ,"Love this movie.  Hill Harper at his finest.  This film follows four young teens in a rural southern town, each at a crossroads in their lives.  A coming of age story about the sometimes tough decisions we are forced to make when transitioning into adulthood and discovery who we are.",1255651200,,284,4.64

Hill Harper should stick to playing wannabe, halfway thugs named Breezy T in movies where LL Cool J calls himself God.

This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.

Total and Complete GARBAGE!!!",1237593600,,211,4.5
8027509,4,B0002F6BUQ,Interesting movie about something we do not hear about much. Harper and Calhoun give good performances. It kind of drags a little. 4/5,1202428800,,134,4.869565217391305
8027510,4,B0002F6BUQ,"The Spiritual aspect of this movie is admirable.  However, the movie is quite disjointed and a bit difficult to follow.  It probably would have been better to have one story, with maybe one sub-story instead of three different stories going all at once.  Still, with all the movies that show African Americans as either criminals or comedic, it is refreshing to see them depicted in this movie very realistically.  Even the shaman seems believable.  [He was the black man on trial in 'To Kill a Mockingbird' many years ago.]  A few used foul language, but most didn't.  I won't tell you how the movie ends, but Christians will appreciate that it is shown as a real answer to prayers.",1167782400,,683,4.689075630252101
