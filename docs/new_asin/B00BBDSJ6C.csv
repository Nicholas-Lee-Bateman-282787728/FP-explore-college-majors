8565301,5,B00BBDSJ6C,"I love Til Schweiger (you will remember him as Hugo Stiglitz in Inglourious Basterds). He is also a director and a writer. I am learning German, so I bought many of his movies. My older kids (11 and 8 years old) & I loved Kokowh (that's the first movie) (we watch many movies on our cinema projector) and I immediately bought the second one (Kokowh 2) without expecting much. Well, it is even funnier than the first one! If you are a mother or a father you will enjoy a lot these movies. They are funny, sweet and with many daily situations that you can relate to. This is not a masterpiece (there are some cliches, of course, but we don't have to watch always Bergman, do we?), but it is a movie that will make you think, laugh & maybe even cry. It touches many aspects about parenthood, love, and friendship. Ideal for enjoying with your older kids.",1493769600,,851,4.3584905660377355
