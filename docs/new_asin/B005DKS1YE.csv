4660796,5,B005DKS1YE,"If you are wondering if you should buy this movie, you should.  You will laugh out loud the whole time.  If you love 80s horror then you will love this movie for sure!",1323993600,3,167,4.03030303030303
4660797,5,B005DKS1YE,"As a huge fan of the old slasher films I was quite looking forward to watching this movie for some time.  I was not disappointed!  I laughed the ENTIRE time. It was one of the most fun movies I've watched in a LONG time.  There was still gore (which is always good) but the clever dialog, ""inside"" jokes, and the wonderful acting of the cast really made it shine.  I will be sure to check out anything these guys put out in the future.",1320537600,4,435,4.142857142857143
4660798,5,B005DKS1YE,"Hilarious slapstick with lots of nods to other classic slasher flicks.  Also, a lot of <wink wink> ""we know its silly"" jokes.  Surprisingly good effects for not so big of a budget.",1318032000,2,180,4.59375
4660799,5,B005DKS1YE,"Caesar and Otto's Summer Camp Massacre is the third great horror-comedy I've seen lately, with the other two being Scream 4 and Gingerdead Man 3: Saturday Night Cleaver. And it's a treat, since the horror-comedy is my favorite genre of film. They are just usually so much fun, and Caesar and Otto's Summer Camp Massacre is no exception. It's a tight 75 minutes, full of comedy, gore, and in-jokes, with special appearances from B-movie veterans Brinke Stevens, Joe Estevez, and Felissa Rose. Rose actually has a good chunk of screentime and her appearance is obviously a homage to Sleepaway Camp. And I must say that Dave Campfield is absolutely hilarious as Caesar. He's like Don Knotts on speed. He delivers his lines quickly and most of his lines are funny. So if it's an independent horror-comedy that you want, you should definitely buy Caesar and Otto's Summer Camp Massacre!",1317945600,4,881,4.919463087248322
4660800,5,B005DKS1YE,"Everything about this film has a classic slasher film to it. However instead of being unintentionally funny like most of the 80's slashers, this movie purposely incorporates a good amount of humor into it. The Caeser and Otto duo very much remind me of a Three Stooges style of comedy. It has a very slap stick, old school feel to it. It's just all around goofy, but being that its SUPPOSED to be goofy and not be taken seriously is what really works for this film. I thought it was extremely entertaining. My favorite character in the film is Dick, played by Deron Miller. Although he has a relatively small part in it, it's very memorable. My favorite part about the movie is the dialog. The interaction and jokes between all of the characters made it very enjoyable. I literally laughed out loud at certain scenes, and I don't often do that. Another thing I really liked were the bonus features. I often buy blu ray versions of movie just for the bonus features they seem to skip on regular DVD format. There are HOURS of extra bonus scenes and commentary. I would highly recommend this film to any fan of horror, or fans of comedy, I think both would like it well. Even though it was just released I feel like I'm watching a movie straight out of the 80's. Its a modern film, with an instant classic feel. There's no better way to describe it.",1317859200,5,1347,4.4574898785425106
4660801,5,B005DKS1YE,strange how the other reviewer loved the movie but only gave it 3 stars. im pretty much writing this to offset that average. i was happy to be a part of this film. look out for deadly x-mas coming soon!,1317254400,2,202,4.075
4660802,3,B005DKS1YE,"Starring: Joe Estevez, Felissa Rose and Brinke Stevens.

This reminded me of those `Don Knotts & Tim Conway' comedies of the '80 s,Well its more like Chuck McCann and Don Knotts style of fun on film.

The cameos are spread out and alot of fun,We remember a time,When b-movie cameos were wasted in VCR fodder; Not anymore Joe Estevez again in a month has some very funny lines and Felissa Rose & Brinke Stevens have alot of stuff to convey to their audience.

The plot of script is very clever and has alot of jokes about Charlie Sheen, Sleepaway Camp, and Gore Humor,Yeah, Gore Humor.

There is hints this two fellows are going to make a series of horror-comedies,Please Do,We say.

Now,You're probably not going Camping,Counseling or seeing 3D after this C & O effort,Anytime soon or email us as a dare completed, IF YOU CAN !!!",1316995200,4,829,4.612244897959184

8467041,2,B005DKS1YE,"I read the reviews and thought I would be in for a treat, but in the first 3 minutes I realized this movie was going to suck and I had to force myself to watch it in its entirety. Caesar and Otto are character clones of Daffy Duck and Porky Pig and there were only about three or four mildly amusing gags in the whole movie. When I think of the potential they had with this script it really frustrates me that they loused it up. Take for example the scene of Caesar (Campfield) punching the police chief's retarded brother, which sounds like a mean spirited hilarious black comedy scene, but isn't thanks to Campfield's flare for over the top stupid Looney Tunes comedy. The short film about Dracula's lawyer was slightly better than the main feature, but suffered because Campfield is stuck in Daffy Duck mode.",1367539200,,811,4.523809523809524
8467042,1,B005DKS1YE,"It could have worked but this is not worth watching. I usually like to give this type of low budget movie a chance but it was really bad; once the subtitles that you cannot disable, that take up 1/4 of the screen, started I was out (the beginning).",1365724800,,248,4.1875

8467044,1,B005DKS1YE,"I tried watching this flick but was so annoyed with the damn subtitles i had to shut it off. This HUGE flaw is the DOWNFALL of the film. I can not give this film a good rating due to sloppy mastering on this DVD. Coaster material, 2 bloody thumbs down, way down!",1357862400,2,262,4.0576923076923075
8467045,4,B005DKS1YE,"I have a friend who actually was part of this film.  I had wanted to see it for that reason alone, but after watching the film I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie.

You should know already if this type of film will appeal to your or not.  It's a fun spoofy take on the horror genre.  Layered with plenty of cheese, the film never becomes boring or dull.  It manages to stay funny and entertaining from the very start until the end.",1330905600,2,454,4.172413793103448
8467046,1,B005DKS1YE,"This Movie has to Win Top Prize for Most Annoying Characters in one Movie.  The lead guy ""Caesar"" has to be the worst character ever caught on film.  I Don't know how this is getting 5 star reviews, it is painfully awful to sit through... I was just waiting for them all to DIE!  I hate this movie, and everyone in it.  If you want to see a GOOD Horror Comedy, with Lots of Laughs and Plenty of Gore, go watch ""TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL"" Instead!",1325894400,2,443,4.057471264367816
