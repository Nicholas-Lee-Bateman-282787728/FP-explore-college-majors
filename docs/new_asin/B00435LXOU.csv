8414160,5,B00435LXOU,"This is a fascinating collection of shorts. Although they were produced for the government, they show a side of the Vietnam era that is compelling and disturbing. You cannot wathc these films without thinking of Full Metal Jacket. But this is the real deal shot at Parris Island, South Carolina where Marines are trained. You'll feel like a girly man compared to these trainees and what they have to endure. Watch them crawling under barbed wire, climbing walls and ropes, swimming while carrying a rifle, being gassed, and more. All while the drill sargeant glears daggers at you! Amazing.",1285027200,2,590,4.96969696969697
