702907,5,630365164X,"This must be the most kitschy Joan Crawford movie I've ever seen and one of the most entertaining as well, being sort of the predecessor of the TV soap opera genre, especially the Alexis Carrington (Dynasty) type of character, vixenish, glossy and sexually charged. Joan manipulates everybody in her family to have her own way, all the other players being merely puppets to the star. Nice bit by the great Fay Wray. Oddly enough, this DVD was released first for the zone 4 market (I bought here in Chile in late August), great picture quality in glorious black & white. A must see!!",1003708800,4,582,4.660194174757281
702908,5,630365164X,"So sayeth the Legend, Queen Joan.  ""Queen Bee"" is prototypical middle-late era (or is it late-middle era?) Crawford.  She's so deliciously good when she's so wickedly bad!
Joan ""vogues"" her way to screen immortality in this one, sashaying around in wildly inappropriate attire, using a riding crop to destroy someone else's room, and uttering snide, catty remarks that cut her co-stars down to size: ""Darling, parties are to women what a battle is to men...oh, I'd forgotten, you weren't in the army, were you?  Something about drinking, wasn't it?""
Joan gives a much more spectacular performance in this than in ""Mildred Pierce,"" the film for which she won an Oscar.  See ""Queen Bee"" and be amazed and delighted that this Woman Among Women actually walked among us mere mortals only 50 short years ago.",997833600,4,803,4.970149253731344
702909,5,630365164X,"funny stuff here, folks---if high camp a la Joan Crawford is your style. truly a camp classic. joan playing the vindictive Jenny, holding her southern in-laws hostage to alot of bitchiness and wardrobe changes. if you cross Tennessee Williams with Aaron Spelling together you MIGHT have an idea of how good-bad this is. the laffs are mostly unintentional & joan is at her best. its easy to see how Lypsinka saw this film & got inspired. Another thing, did Joan really slap the actress who played her neice across her face w/ such force? I've rewound that scene over & over again & that slap looked very real & very painful. I felt sorry for the poor actress in this movie!

the film is basically joan holding a rich ""southern"" family hostage with her knowledge of ""secrets"" and blackmail.  BTW, no one in the film bothered to even attempt a southern accent so the idea that they're suppossed to be ""southern"" is virtually forgettable.  But Joan as Jenny chews scenery as she flutters around a sweet naive neice who knows nothing at first but slowly realizes the tangled web she's entered--w/ sweet aunt Jenny as the QUEEN BEE!

She pretty much gives you everything you could want in a film like this--dramatic outbursts, physical violence, cutting comments, tears, you name it....oh and the outfits. this is the definitive Joan Crawford film.",981676800,2,1342,4.796536796536796
702910,5,630365164X,"A laugh-till-you-ache classis, Queen Bee ranks up there with ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""Female Trouble"" as one of the campiest  movies ever made.  The only difference is that they didn't mean it!  Or  maybe they did?

In any case, Joan is the only focus here, swaddled in Jean Louis gowns and jewels by ""Ruser of Beverly Hills"", she mows down cast members and sets with equal fervor.  But can you blame her?  I wanted to smack Lucy Marlowe, and I wasn't sharing a soundstage with her.  Everybody else just stands there, watching Joan act.

But God love her, Crawford actually manages to mine a grain of humanity from her Gorgon-in-sables.  She has a few scenes that make you see how the Queen Bee actually needed to develop her sting to survive- and how sometimes she has bitterly repented it.

That's the fun of these late Crawford movies- they're waaaaaaaaay over the top, but Our Joan takes the time to actually try to create a character amidst all that cheese.",964137600,6,962,4.633136094674557

703096,3,630365164X,"Plot moves briskly, if implausibly, Joan glitters with evil like a Disney witch, and the production values are high--and this includes the performances of her supporting cast (for, let's face it, this is a one-woman show). So it's hard to hate ""Queen Bee""--it's got too much going for it. At the same time, it's not much fun outside of the obvious camp factor. A more appropriate title might have been ""And Then There Were None,"" since the Queen is essentially a one-woman firing squad, assassinating each character, one by one, with no real motivation. This might have been more palatable if anyone in the house had enough grit to fight back, but they don't. So after awhile, you get tired of feeling sorry for them. What gives?  Is this a plantation of masochists?

Joan tackles her role with such zesty aplomb however, that she is fun to watch, even while meting out her distasteful punishments. Like Bette Davis's ""Baby Jane"", she is the one having all the fun, and so becomes the accidental heroine of the piece,  when it's supposed to be Lucy Marlowe as Cousin Jen. But mousy Jen is so hapless, the audience doesn't WANT to identify with her. So the key to enjoying ""Queen Bee"" is not unlike a John Waters movie, or for that matter, Godzilla--just root for the monster and assume the victims had it coming!

To their credit, the writers do try to infuse Crawford's Eva with some vague pathos, but the effort is not wholly convincing (she claims that the other characters in the house made her the way she is, but it's never explained just how).  And a few characters do bite back here and there--but never hard enough, which over the course of a feature film, has a cumulatively wearying effect.

Crawford fans and camp enthusiasts will likely enjoy its flawed grandiosity, but personally, I think ""Female on the Beach"" gives you more bang for the buck. She's just as smart and just as tart in the sandy melodrama, but it's a less mean-spirited affair.",1447804800,2,1958,4.6773255813953485

703098,4,630365164X,Interesting movie. Joan Crawford was outstanding. The acting by all of them was terrific but I didn't care for the plot twist when one of the characters does something I thought seemed totally out of character. The ending was one that had to happen because of the morality of that time period. I'd like to see the movie re-done today with a comeuppance that would be more fitting. I felt sorry for the kids in the story more than anyone else. However it is a thoroughly watchable and enjoyable movie.,1447027200,,500,4.566666666666666

703101,4,630365164X,"This movie is a classic Joan Crawford.  She is in her element as the evil wife, Barry Sullivan is at his brooding resentful, and long-suffering husband.  Betsy Palmer as the sister-in-law Queenie destroys.  It is like watching a snake devour a kitten slowly.  You feel the underlying terror of the soft hearted Betsy as Black Mamba Joan meticulously destroys her life by taking away her fiance.  And the young ingnue who is captivated by her at first is so appalled and so helpless battling the feelings of love for brooding Barry.  Ms. Crawford's children are tortured too, as Queenie insists on an abusive caretaker, and the end is so predictable as she pushes her husband far past his limit of endurance. But you still want to go along for the ride.  Her daughter once said that Joan in this movie was her true self.  I can believe it.  I believed Christina about her childhood abuse.  Why would anyone be able to make up that specific and unique abuse?  Like another favorite, Bette Davis, Mommie Dearest seemed to have a special affinity for playing the evil ones.  Her horrible make-up, like a hideous carnival clown would give anyone nightmares.",1441584000,4,1152,4.762626262626263

703489,2,630365164X,"Joan Crawford is JOAN CRAWFORD in what is perhaps her campiest and silliest role.

Crawford, at this stage of the game, was eager for a buck and Columbia provided the oppotrunity for the Academy Award winning actress to tilt the wheel, yet again, in her disfavor.

Every woman in this film is an idiot.  Every man in this film is twice the idiot and horny.

It becomes messy.

And for all of Crawford's gowns and her highfalutin ways, she exposes herself as just as much an idiot of those that she has chosen to surround her.  But Crawford, at 55 or so, is the SEXIEST woman in town.  Really?  Please.

The woman is whacked yet no one, no script-writer, or producer, or director, or studio head was going to rein her in.  She, Joan, is taking this role right through the finish line.  Oh, she'll tromp on anyone and everyone to do it.  Snd she'll win.

But WTF has she won?  After this film, her career became more disturbed and odd and selfish and distraught.  Yet she was willing to do anyting to prolong her big fame and her questionalbe talent.

Sadly, there is no real future for Joan after this film. She winds up always horny and stupid.  With a checkered past; ergo: the horniness and stupidity.  Her characters are always clever, but her arms always ALWAYS enfold themselves into harms way with the wrong man.

Her Eva Phillips comes across as a washed-out version of her character in ""The Women."" She does have a few zingers in this film but  she should have played this role 20 years earlier. As was often the case with later period Crawford films, Joan is overly made up, over-dressed, and laughably too old to have two young children, as she does in ""Queen Bee."" Poor Betsy Palmer is stuck with a drab wardrobe, lousy lighting, and  neurotic dialogue, all designed to make Crawford look better. Crawford did this to Hope Lange in ""The Best of Everything"" and to Mercedes McCambridge in ""Johnny Guitar,"" two other marginal Crawford films of the 1950's. The men in ""Queen Bee"" look like drones compared to Joan, until the predictable finale, which is unsatisfying.

703569,5,630365164X,"Crawford's Columbia period resulted in some of her very best movies.  In fact, the 50s as a whole were great for her, and I'd rather watch a 50's Joan movie than a 40s or 30's--for the most part.  She seemed to be trying out many different things, showing different colors.  All right, most of them pretty garish, but she wasn't afraid to think big.  But in one respect the fifties let her down, and that is her men.  OMG, they are pretty dire, by and large.  Here and there you have someone unique, a Jack Palance, a Sterling Hayden, a Jeff Chandler--not that any of the three are particularly good actors, but they're masculine!  But what's a girl to do when paired up with a dud like Wendell Corey or Michael Wilding or, as in QUEEN BEE, Barry Sullivan and John Ireland, none of whom could keep up with her a minute.  (I can't make up my mind about Cliff Robertson, in AUTUMN LEAVES, a superb picture, but wouldn't it have been better with someone ballsier?  Or should he have been weak and weird, like Cliff?  Oh, the eternal questions when you're ranking the different Joan Crawford eras.

I liked QUEEN BEE a lot, but never has Crawford been surrounded by so many inept supporting actors.  Everyone loves Betsy Palmet, me too, but she was not the right actress to play the sister-in-law part.  Fay Wray is great, but Ranald McDougall's screenplay trapdoors her right out of the film after the first ten minutes, and in her play we get the eternally deadfaced Lucy Marlow, with her tiny eyes the size of baby caviare eggs.  To her credit, Lucy Marlow pioneered a screen presence for the presentday star Renee Zellweger.  They must have thought audiences wanted baby voiced, tiny eyed chipmunk faced stars and to our shame, we sat there and took it like wimps.",1275350400,,1764,4.555555555555555

703571,4,630365164X,"The South must hold the monopoly in bitter, fractured families.  In QUEEN BEE, based on the novel by Edna Lee, every member of the Phillips family has their own axe to grind...and it all stems from matriarch Eva (played brilliantly by Joan Crawford).  Eva manipulates everyone around her with precision skill.  In a loveless marriage with alcoholic husband Avery (Barry Sullivan), Eva is also dallying with her cousin's fiancee (John Ireland).  When Eva's distant relation Jennifer Stewart (Lucy Marlow) comes to live with the Phillips clan, Eva's ""sweet sting"" soon infects her as well.  The machinations continue as Eva twists the lives of her family members until they all shatter.

Joan Crawford lets the venom flow with her masterly performance as Eva, the queen bee of the title.  Dressed in some gorgeous Jean Louis gowns and filtered through soft lighting, ""La Crawford"" commands the screen in every possible way.  Notice too, how her voice changes from soft and honeyed when Eva is trying to get what she wants, to gruff and unforgiving when her temper snaps.  The brilliant supporting cast includes Betsy Palmer as ill-fated cousin Carol-Lee, and Fay Wray as the jilted Sue McKinnon.  Contract player Lucy Marlow, in one of her first lead roles, provides the innocent core of the story, yet our eyes remain riveted to Crawford.  She was the ultimate Queen Bee!

From the moment she comes on the screen she owns it as well as all of her co stars. Crawford makes the film as a ruthless woman who destroys everyone around her in the South. The film was written by her ""Mildred Pierce"" scripter Ronald Mcdouggal who captures the coldness that Crawford can transfer to the screen. One is amazed at her performance and even her daughter Christina fled the movie theatre halfway through  because it reminded her of how Joan was at home. Many Hollywood actresses could learn a few things from Crawford's stellar performance. A great picture with wonderful film and audio quality. A rare gem.",1193097600,3,723,4.784
703642,5,630365164X,"Joan rules the roost and this movie as Eva Phillips, whose sharp tongue tears her family apart one by one.  She's married to Avery (Barry Sullivan)--or Beauty as they call him (despite the ugly scar on his face)--he's turned to drink because of his bitch of a wife.  Avery's sister Carol Lee (played by a perky blonde Betsy Palmer, preparing herself for her later stardom as Jason's mother in 1980's ""Friday the 13th""--""Queen Bee"" is a horror flick of a different kind)--anyway, Carol Lee is in love with Jud (John Ireland), who used to be involved with--yup, you guessed it--Eva! But poor Carol Ann doesn't know this secret.  And when she and Jud announce their engagement, Hurricane Eva doesn't take the news very well.  You'll have to watch the film to find out what happens next to this dysfunctional clan--but four stars of my review belong soley to Joan (the remaining one is for the wonderful black and white cinematography), who is the reason to watch this melodrama.  Her outfits are divine, her face is always lit perfectly in her every scene and her smooth delivery of outrageous lines that slap her ""loved ones"" across the face (and she even delivers an actual slap to one unfortunate soul) is a delight to watch.  If you love Ms. Crawford, then you gotta see ""Queen Bee""--it's one of my favorites of her flicks.  And the DVD also includes the campy theatrical trailer, which is a hoot.  You can't take ""Queen Bee"" too seriously or you'll be horrified by Joan's horrible behavior.  Instead, you just need to sit back and enjoy a delicious dark comedy--that's the way I view this over-the-top classic--and laugh and hiss at Joan's evil ways.

703643,5,630365164X,"""Queen Bee"" is perhaps Joan's defining picture of the fifties. Not because it's a great movie, but because Joan worked so hard in this film.

Joan plays Eva Phillips, a family matriarch that rules her hive with an iron fist and an iron tongue. Eva has no use for other women, and as far as she's concerned, the men in her life are only good for 1 thing. (Take one guess what that is!) Eva will stop at nothing to manipulate the people around her; the woman is absolutely conniving. The question is, will anyone be able to stop The Queen-Bee before it's too late...?

If you're new to Miss Crawford's impressive fifties film resume, might I also recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harriet-Craig/dp/6303962068/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harriet Craig</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Story-of-Esther-Costello/dp/6304329016/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Story of Esther Costello</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sudden-Fear/dp/B00000IPHP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sudden Fear</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-Guitar/dp/6303391931/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny Guitar</a>&nbsp;and ""Female On The Beach.""

After you see ""Queen Bee"" you will see why Joan and this film are so loved. Because in this movie Joan is dramatic, very beautiful, fashionable and way to bitchy for her own good. In all her mean-spiritedness, Eva Phillips manages to make Leona Helmsley, Madonna and Barbra Streisand all look like very sweet Disney characters!

I also enjoyed Betsy Palmer very much in this movie. Incidentally, I just recently watched a game show that Betsy and Miss Crawford did together many years after this movie. They did that one dramatic part from the movie when Eva says, ""any man's my man if I want him."" It was so funny!!

Incidentally, I really love the cover of the VHS for ""Queen Bee."" Like the movie, it's just so over-the-top and dramatic and theatrical.

""Queen Bee"" taught me that Joan was a fighter who never gave up! Like a cat holding onto her 9th life hanging off the GE building, Joan always knew how to endure.",1189900800,,2202,6.1797385620915035

703646,4,630365164X,"This was one of Joan Crawford's last Glamour Queen movie roles, before she started doing horror films and TV, and this part itself is transitional, as she plays a legendary beauty, pathological in her manipulations of the people around her.  Despite the huge 1950s eyebrows that could be seen on Joan, Audrey Hepburn, Kim Novak, and others during this period, and the weird heart shaped hairdo, Joan remains both a beauty and a really compelling and totally invested actress.  This was after Joan did POSSESSED and proved she could both underplay and play full tilt.  Here she plays a woman so deeply dishonest that she is unconvincing in every emotion - we don't even know if she believes any of this herself.

 The real stand out performance of this film is Barry Sullivan as Joan's physically and emotionally scarred husband.  He is completely believable in a roller coaster role.  The prototype of the sexy damaged man.

 The film itself is average, the script is soap opera predictable, and the biggest mystery (how he got scar) is never revealed, only hinted at.  Despite Joan's title character and her entrance-making Jean Louis wardrobe, this really is an ensemble piece, and everyone does a good solid job in this Southern gothic potboiler.  The ""town and country"" set of this film feels both ostentatiously grand and a little too cramped and small, and that is a good way of describing the whole thing.",1164844800,18,1412,4.866108786610878
703647,5,630365164X,"Being an unapologetic Joan Crawford fan, I could enjoy just about any cinematic drivel she has appeared in (and I'm sure I have).  While Queen Bee isn't drivel, it's no Mildred Pierce either - - but I loved it all the same!

Joan plays Eva Phillips and although she is probably a good 10-15 years older than the scriptwriter envisioned, she still looks remarkable.  She is married (unhappily as we will find out) to the alcoholic Avery, whom she stole away from the sweet Sue (played too briefly by Fay Wray).

The movie revolves around Eva and Avery's unhappy union, her chasing of Judson, who is enamored of her sister-in-law Carol and with whom she had an affair some years back, and Eva's annoyingly meek cousin Jennifer who has just arrived at their southern mansion.  Soon, the fur is flying, Joan is wearing some fabulous Jean Louis designs and the witty barbs are everywhere.

The only weak part of the movie is Jennifer, who is so cowardly and timid, it's a hard sell to think that she's even remotely related to Eva.  Seeing her cowering and tearing up over Eva raising her voice just makes me want to cheer when Eva finally slaps the daylights out of the girl.

But one weak character aside, the movie is a fun and exciting 1950s soap opera -- and seeing Eva take out her frustrations with a riding crop is worth the price of the movie itself!

Joan, Joan, Joan - completely over-the-top in this movie, yet, completely *under*-the-table in her private life. This is her last gasp of her semi-respectable moviemaking period before she gave way to the scream-queen roles and went full-throttle into her alcoholism. ""If this is what America wants, then, by God, I'll give it to them,"" she was quoted as saying at the time. I don't know if it's what *America* wanted to see, but it's certainly what *I* wanted to see - Joan in her best ""mow-`em-all-down"" mode, chewing up the scenery, and looking divine in clothes by Jean Louis (that's *Zsh-an Lu-wee*). They don't make actresses like this anymore - and they certainly don't make movie roles like this anymore. The inherent Joan-violence was more insidious, rather than graphic, as it later became in such charmers as *Berserk* and *Strait-Jacket*. Except at home of course, where Joan performed her Queen Bee routine nightly under the name of Mommie Dearest. Daughter Christina has said that this movie comes very close to home in Joan's portrayal. The story (this time) seems to revolve around Joan (naturally), as Eva Phillips, wife of ""Beauty"" Phillips (Sullivan), who is anything *but*. The arrival of a cousin to fill a rather nebulous ""secretarial"" position for Joan/Eva sets off an ugly chain of events. The secretary, Jennifer, who is ""so quiet we ought to put a bell on you,"" becomes the recipient of one of Joan's famous slaps. A lot of ""Beauty's"" dysfunctional family and friends hang around a lot, including Carol, played by Betsy Palmer (""Carol, don't you look sweet, even in those tacky old riding clothes!""), who hangs around so long, she winds up hanging on the business end of a rope. Everyone drinks a lot and Joan keeps the whole show hopping with her machinations and new outfits for every other sentence. With a particular shot of Joan in an evening gown, standing on the staircase in her home as its calling card, this movie definitely bears several viewings to absorb the excess of high camp, but, like drug store perfume, once absorbed, you'll never quite rid of it.

Aside from ""Strait-jacket"", which, in fact, made Joan Crawford seem more sympathetic as an axe-murder(!), this film, ""Queen Bee"" most portrays the movie legend as she apparently really was.

You can tell--- all the outrageous neuroses are in full-swing.

""Mildred Pierce"" showed Joan in a light she'd like, but ""Queen Bee"" rings the most true...

Despite totally incompetent direction from Ranald MacDougall, it's still a good potboiler, with occasionally saucy lines to (and from) Crawford, like, ""Whatever you are, Eva, it's on wheels!""

Unfortunately, the DVD is one of those false-widescreen prints they're doing now (Columbia seems most guilty) in which the top of the heads and feet are cut off to create a rectangular shape, losing part of the original visual composition.

She is abetted with a fine supporting cast, especially the tragic figure of Betsy Palmer who is driven to suicide by Crawford.

703734,5,630365164X,"Joan Crawford appears to have a field day in this silly, but extraordinarily engrossing, overheated family melodrama. Ranald MacDougall's script is like Tennessee Williams without the poetry or the subtext. And it's like Douglas Sirk without the sumptuous color or the inner turmoil those autumnal hues disguise.
Eva Philips is possessive, controlling, and self-absorbed, and Crawford plays her to the hilt. What more could any fan ask?
A monument of selfishness, Eva fascinates like a cobra about to strike. In one memorable scene, her cousin asks what the doctor said (about Eva's troubled child). ""Such extravagant things!"" responds Eva. She continues: ""Did you see how the doctor trembled as he spoke to me? You'd think he'd never seen a beautiful woman before!""
Moments like these are pure gold (or should it be 'honey'?) in this wondrous opera-without-singing.
The rest of the cast consists of some more than adequate talent: Barry Sullivan (Eva's booze-soaked, trampled husband), John Ireland (a former lover, still caught by her stinger. He gets one of the best lines: ""Whatever you are Eva, you're on wheels!""), Betsy Palmer (the deer in Eva's lethal headlights). Lucy Marlow (another deer, that starlet from the opening sequence of A STAR IS BORN, 1954) is passable. (In a TCM documentary, it is revealed that Crawford really slapped the younger actress with all her might.). Fay Wray makes a brief, but noteworthy appearance early on, a past casualty of Eva's rampaging ego.

As the arch-manipulator Eva Philips, Joan excels for a number of reasons: She's clearly the only capable actor in this otherwise awful movie (although John Ireland's performance is very good), and looks absolutely spellbinding in all of her glorious costumes (custom-made by designer Jean-Louis). In fact, if it wasn't for the indomitable Miss Crawford's formulaic scenery-chewing this film would probably never have been converted to VHS, much less DVD.
Anyway, trapped in a loveless marriage to a bitter alcoholic, Joan sets about destroying all happiness around her, craving power and attention as her only means of comfort. Her cousin Jennifer Stewart (played in the most woeful manner by the consummately irritating Lucy Marlow)comes to stay and all hell breaks loose as Joan tries her damndest to break up her sister-in-law's engagement to her ex-lover Judson Prentiss (Ireland).
Memorable scenes are when Joan learns of their engagement ('Isn't it REVOLTING??!!?'), Joan getting out of a dinner party engagement (nobody does phone like Joan!), and Joan viciously slapping her idiot cousin Jennifer (clearly a real slap, and clearly in response to Marlow's woeful 'acting').

You could see the obvious - that she sleeps around on her husband and hurts the people around her. Or you could look deeper and see that Eva is trapped in a loveless marriage to an alcoholic! It comes as no surprise to me that she would want Judd.. The sympathy that Joan generates for her character - near the very end when she loves Avery again, after he begins to at last show affection towards her - was probably not written into the script at all. It certainly wasn't in the book by Edna Lee. Joan takes some of the implications of the story and molds sort of a tragic character...a woman who does wrong because (1) she is surrounded by people who don't care about her and (2) her husband doesn't love her. It's true that the character was designed to be a femme fatale, but I believe Joan didn't view this character as all black and she added a little bit of her artistry to the performance.
  As for the film, Queen Bee is a class A production. Certainly there are some contrived moments but the overall effect of the movie is very powerful. There is a surreal, larger-than-life quality to its excesses and could be in a genre all its own, thanks mostly to Joan's performance - which is one of her greatest and most memorable. It really proves why Joan is often remembered as the most glamorous star ever - and she had the guts, ambition, talent, and heart to back it all up. I agree with a reviewer who once wrote that Joan treated this film like one of her silents...her eyes convey more emotion than possibly any actress I've ever seen before. Just watch the mirror scene with the cold cream (a scene that has been copied many times but never equalled) or the scene where Joan tells Carol, ""Any man's my man if I want it that way."" The look in those sad, haunting Crawford eyes is priceless!",1063584000,6,1888,4.360795454545454
703739,5,630365164X,"Joan really rhymes with WITCH in this movie....and I loved every minute of it! It is classic Crawford every step of the way...Miss Crawford sets the tone of her character from her entrance where she verbally exhibits her cruelty on her son from then on she ""strikes"" like a scorpion injecting her deadly venom into the souls of those around her....Certainly the woman is a control [person] who rules those around her with fear, but she wouldn't be Joan Crawford if she came off like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm now would she? The movie is excellent in explaining the reasons why Joan is so miserable let alone destructive to the women around her....and her poor husband..trapped in a loveless marriage....See this one for sure!",1059782400,,726,4.862903225806452
703809,4,630365164X,"Joan is at her delectable best, as she steamrolls her way over the supporting cast, totally stealing every scene with her over-the-top style.
This is one dame who's not going to blend into the scenery. If you are a Crawford fan, and if your reading the reviews of this film, you must be, you simply must add this film to your collection. Joan plays Eva Phillips, a conniving southern socialite, with a taste for the finer things, only matched by her taste for other women's men. Eva's the queen bee, and there's no doubt that she's the one running the hive. Joan delivers some wonderful lines in the film, for instance, ""Any man's my man if I want it that way"". Joan looks wonderful slinking around in drop dead gowns designed by Jean Louis. Whether she's verbally abusing her alcoholic husband or driving the poor unfortunates who dare cross her to suicide, Joan can do no wrong. Of course in the end, Eva gets what she deserves.
Add this film to your Joan collection, it's really a keeper.",1043884800,3,991,4.573033707865169
703810,3,630365164X,"""Queen Bee"" is a must for any Joan Crawford fan. As the self-absorbed southern socialite, Eva Phillips, Crawford barrels through the film, destroying anyone who stands in her way, chewing enough scenery to make even the most ravenous pirahna green with envy, all done with perfect clothes, hair and makeup.
The soap-opera like plot revolves around Crawford's Eva (did you expect anything different?). As the film opens, we learn that Eva has already trapped her wealthy husband, Avery (Barry Sullivan) into marriage after destroying his engagement to Fay Wray (who seems to be heavily medicated here...perhaps she should stick to big apes!) Sullivan responds by turning to the bottle. Not the first person Crawford has driven to drink, I'm sure.
Still not content, Eva sets her sights on reigniting her love affair with Avery's sister's fiance, Judson (I told you it was a soap-opera). Judson (John Ireland), however, loves Carol Lee (Betsy Palmer) and wants nothing to do with Eva. Unwilling to let a little thing like love stand in her way, Eva schemes to break up the lovebirds and she succeeds in a big way! Finally, Avery decides he can take no more and resolves to put an end to Eva's back stabbing and attempts to atone for past sins (both his and Eva's).
The film is not very good and is redeemed only by Crawford's over-the-top performance. Her lines are delivered with such sickenly sweet innocence that she could send any diabetic into a fatal coma!! Crawford's star was beginning to dim at this point but she continued to play the grand diva to the hilt, refusing to give in to a faultering career. Her acting in the film fairly screams....""LOOK AT ME! AREN'T I GREAT!"" Funny stuff on the surface but also kind of sad too.
Some of the film's dialouge is delightfully campy as well. After being caught in a near clutch with Judson by her visiting cousin, Crawford sweetly smiles and says, ""I didn't see you. You're so quiet we'll have to put a BELL on you."" Classic Crawford.
For the average movie goer, this film may not make much of an impression. The pace is slow and the ending is all to predictable but for Crawford afficienados it's must viewing.",1043798400,6,2163,4.75531914893617
703811,4,630365164X,"I had waited a very long time to watch this movie, although my friends had recommended it over and over. It was very much worth the wait! Joan is as mean and hateful as she could be and she gets great costumes as well. Sure, the story line is pretty transparent, the overall acting is pretty awful (sometimes they all ""try on"" southern accents and then seem to abandon them), but it's Joan's show and she does her best to upstage everyone and usually does a very good job of it. For pure camp, you can't beat this movie.",1041552000,,520,4.262626262626263
703812,2,630365164X,"What a disappointing film. A dull storyline, and an overacting Crawford to make it pathetic.  It's not a classic even though on the box it says 'Columbia Classic'.  It's only worth owning if you are trying to get the complete Crawford set. While 'Strait Jacket' was bad too, it is ten times better than this because it has some funny scenes.  Queen Bee fails in two ways - weak storyline, and poor acting from everyone.",1036454400,2,419,4.56
703813,4,630365164X,"This relatively little-seen yet thoroughly enjoyable latter Crawford performance is essential viewing for her fans (I'm not one of them particularly). Joan chews the scenery and tries to ruin the lives of those unfortuate enough to be in her orbit. Eva Phillips (Joan) is a selfish, insidious and rotten-to-the-core (rhymes with rich) who appears to be the embodiment of charm and love. In this particular review, I shall refrain from giving away details of the plot for this one: just know that when Crawford gets her much-awaited comeuppance, it's a relief to us all...In her frank, celebrated expose of her famous late mother, Christina Crawford related that she was stunned when she first viewed this film back in 1955 upon its initial release. Why? Christina stated that her mother was EXACTLY like that in her personal life and it took very little acting ability on her part to pull off believably the role of a scheming shrike (!). Whether this is a grossly exageratted statement or not shouldn't matter much to fans of LaCrawford's films, however - the actress got paid for what she projected to her many fans in the audience, not as a model mother. Perhaps it would have been wiser for both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford to have kept pets instead of raising children...Once in the 1940's, Crawford was dining in an L.A. restaurant where a mother tried to discipline her irritating young child in vain at a nearby table. When the woman asked Joan for advice, stating ""I don't know what to do. I've tried everything"" Crawford's sardonic reply was ""Have you considered infatricide?"".",1032912000,,1589,4.910780669144981
703814,5,630365164X,"This is not a classic 50's movie by a long shot, but it is a showcase/vehicle for noneother than Joan Crawford herself. She's in practically every scene and the film itself is her slave. As a neurotic, dominating manipulator she ruins everyone's life because she ""can't help it"". Her character, Eva, believes it's not her fault but everyone elses' that she's the way she is. As per her contract, Crawford is given the ""star treatment"" and her costumes border on gaudy drag queen ensembles. And her dialogue? ""I don't know when I've been in such a temper!"" she tosses off after demolishing a room with a riding crop in front of a horrified guest. Frankly, I like this movie. Crawford is ultra-camp any way you slice it and this movie is prime 50's Crawford.",1031961600,,756,4.649253731343284
703815,3,630365164X,"A dozen years after her M-G-M contemporaries had settled into their involuntary and disgruntled retirements, Joan Crawford was still in the game. Her ""Queen Bee"" is not the world's greatest movie, but it's not the worst either, not by a long shot.
Crawford plays Eva Phillips, doyenne of an Atlanta mansion and married to a facially scarred husband she's nicknamed Beauty, which gives a glimmer of how twisted Eva is. Eva gets her kicks out of manipulating hubby, her old lover, her old lover's fiancee (who is Beauty's sister- this is a very close family, if you know what I mean, and I'm sure you do), and dear cousin Jennifer. Crawford also has two pre-adolescent kids, a biological coup for a fiftyish woman in 1955, when this movie was made.
Much has been said and written about Crawford's scenery-chewing in this one, but it's interestingly done. La Suprema Joan uses the movie as a showcase for all the acting tricks she had so painfully acquired over thirty years in front of the camera. So polished had she become, she's able to convey menace simply by entering a room with a smile on her face. And when she gets mean, no one is meaner, as the rest of the cast finds out by slow degrees. Crawford causes one character to commit suicide, and she has a little tour-de-force moment when Eva learns what has happened. She's seated in front of her dressing table, creaming her face, and suddenly, chillingly, loses it when she hears the news. Both the script and the actress have the intelligence to refrain from explaining the reaction. Is she horrified by what she's done? Is she terrified that she has the capacity to do it? Is she just putting on an act expected of her? We don't know, and it's to Crawford's credit that she is able to communicate the ambiguity in the middle of a bit of Grand Guignol.
Most other actors in the cast take their cues from Crawford, acting more floridly than they ever had before or ever would again. Barry Sullivan and John Ireland do well by the husband and the lover, respectively. Betsy Palmer attempts to stand up to Crawford's acting and to assume a Southern accent: both efforts were doomed to failure. The great and underutilised Fay Wray plays a Southern belle whom Eva bested in the race to see who could get Beauty to the altar first; she's lost her mind over it, and Wray's portrayal is touching, if overdrawn. The one cast member who comes out smelling like a rose is Lucy Marlow, whose arrival as a guest sets the movie's plot spinning; Marlow is the one natural and unaffected thing in the cast, and in the movie.
The camp aspects of the film are many, not least of which is Crawford's appearance -- wigged, sporting Kabuki-like makeup, and corseted so sternly Playtex should have gotten screen credit. Her wardrobe's a delight, with one knockout Jean Louis strapless in black velvet with a white satin fishtail, and more jewellery than you could shake a stick at, much of it Crawford's own. The Southern mansion in which all the action takes place is more lavish than anything really found in 1955 Atlanta (I'm from there, and the Coca-Cola heirs don't live this well), but it's properly grand and creepy.
Watch this for what it is- a camp classic. Appreciate it for something else, as well. Crawford was the one star of her generation to have the studio system figured out so well, she was able to survive and prosper during its demise. ""Queen Bee"" may just look like fun to us today, but it's also a document of how hard one actress fought to keep working in the years when the lights were going out on soundstage after soundstage, all over Hollywood. Crawford may be the most villainous villainess ever on-camera, but her performance also reminds us of how ruthlessly she kicked aside the wreckage that was 1950's Tinseltown, and rose above it to get the one thing she wanted above all else: to stay a star.",1022457600,65,3865,4.627365356622999

703817,5,630365164X,"Queen Bee comes out of Joan's own world behind the camera, so her daughter Christina told us in the Gospel of dysfunctional diaries of kids, Mommie Dearest.
Here Joan poses on steps and then descends, says things to people that render them speechless, powerless, and (on occasion) lifeless.
She sweeps things off mantle pieces with a riding crop, steps on plans others have for a new house, scars her husbad(before the film opens) and calls him ""Beauty."" Joan flirts with the doctor caring for her sick child, and enslaves an in-law, dominates a niece and makes everyone serve her in some capacity that takes up most of their lives. The finale is surreal and surefire entertainment.
Sometimes hilarious, always camp in the extreme, and yet you cannot take your eyes off Joan as she buzzes through lives and stings them to death.
Buy this one and thrill to the extrvagant things within the DVD's chapters.",1010707200,5,904,4.838709677419355
703818,4,630365164X,"This is a stagey drama in which Joan Crawford is cast as the villainess. She plays the role of Eva Phillips, a manipulative, rich witch, who thrives on making those around her as miserable as is possible. She is married to Avery, well played by a brooding and dour Barry Sullivan. Avery is a wealthy mill owner who is bitterly unhappy in his marriage and drowns his sorrows with alcohol. Eva is the queen bee and autocratically rules over her hive, and, boy, has she got some sting! Whatever Eva wants, Eva gets, and the hell with anybody else. She is the character that the viewer loves to hate.
Betsy Palmer winsomely plays the role of Carol Lee, Avery's sister. She is engaged to marry her brother's right hand man, Judson Prentiss, played with appropriate melancholic angst by John Ireland. What Betsy is about to find out from Eva about Judson is calculated to hurt her. What Eva does not count on is the fallout that will ultimately encompass her own precious self with tragic results.
Lucy Marlow plays the role of the ingenue, Eva's cousin who has come to stay with her. At first, she is fooled by Eva, but quickly realizes just what a piece of work Eva is. Avery and Eva's cousin fall in love, however, and end up having the last laugh on Eva.
