8551210,2,B00AG4765M,"This is a 2012 SyFy made for US TV complete with anachronisms from haircut to shoes. Aladdin (Darren Shahlavi) and his treasure hunting side-kick Luca (Noam Jenkins) unleash an evil Jinn and spend the rest of the film trying to get the evil Jinn back into the lamp. Kandyse McClure provides some harem girl outfit eye-candy. Eugene Clark is the voice of reason...oh yea there is a bad guy who wants the lamp.

Difficult to sit through. Might have some appear to young boys. Acting and script cardboard.",1471392000,,502,4.704545454545454
8551211,3,B00AG4765M,I wanted to be the first person to give this movie a review but two other people beat me to it. They have also given this movie such a beaten too with bad reviews. What good about this movie was that most of these actors and actress came for already hit TV shows & movies. This movie wasn't the best of their works but they did a very nice job in it. Giving that most of SyFy movies are sorry at best this movie was truly a breathe of fresh air for me.  It was like seeing very the first Wishmaster movie but instead of rated R it was rated PG-13. I hope this review help give this movie back some creditibility.,1371600000,3,612,4.016393442622951
8551212,1,B00AG4765M,"easliy the worst movie of 2012. You can call it a ""syfy"" and get away with childish acting, storyline and effects. Spead the time reading a newspaper will be more valuable.",1367712000,,172,4.580645161290323
8551213,1,B00AG4765M,"They could have done so much with the story, but all they did was cheap graphics, cool-wannabe dialogues, and a very bad delivery....Luckily, I didn't pay for it",1365724800,2,161,4.785714285714286
