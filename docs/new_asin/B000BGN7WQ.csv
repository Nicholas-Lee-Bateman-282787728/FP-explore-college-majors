Although the crime plot is without doubt worth following, it's a far better bet to enjoy this for any among a multitude of other reasons.

The irreverence appealed to me, and its hasty pace, the blocking and the acting (the score by Georges Delerue is better than all right, too) - and Fanny Ardant is captivating. The French (Truffaut, in this case, in his last film) do know how to utilize their actresses in a different, far richer way than most recent English-speaking film-makers: they're so much more than pretty faces, after all, aren't they? Truffaut and Ardant lived together, and she'd had his child by the time this was made. He featured her in several films, and in this she seems fully  comfortable left to make the most of her part.

I'd say that this flick is more theatrical than cinematic, and it also has strewn about rich little ironies about the business of being a cop thriller. Trintignant plays it straight and earnest, while Ardant carries the lead convincingly enough, yet with such joy as to seem almost in raptures through much of it. From various angles her sharp features are hard and have a vague masculinity, yet for all that she is quite alluring: shaped like a model, her starring, sometimes edgy part is strident and often near-athletic. A love angle is an unneeded bond for the pair, at least to me, and does not quite gel or convince. But, still, this too doesn't mar the production.

There's one brief, half-seen scene, an over-macho act that jabs like a thorn - making no sense, having no real place, and, besides, it reeks as politically inept for most of us in the politically-obsessed 21st century.

Still, a fun couple of hours. In atmospheric b&w.",1368230400,,1868,4.6314199395770395
8086377,5,B000BGN7WQ,"Even though he made so many more ""important"" and/or groundbreaking films, it's ""Vivement Dimanche"" (released stateside as ""Confidentially Yours"") that I keep returning to, like a favorite restaurant.  It was Truffaut's last film, and his legendary humanity and love of character are just as strong in this film as his love of Hitchcock, American film noir, and smart, strong and beautiful women.  I treasure owning a copy of ""Day for Night,"" which was pulled from its DVD release over a threatened lawsuit with its distributor, and have strong feelings about so many of his movies, truly too many to list, but this one seems to sum up Truffaut's gifts sublimely.  That it was to be his final film only makes that fact even more satisfying.  Enjoy!",1325980800,2,747,4.904761904761905
8086378,4,B000BGN7WQ,"Vivement dimanche is a complex and fun take on film noir. There are all the usual elements: murder, disceit, mistaken identity, romance, infidelity. Truffaut's touch is ligth but masterful. His actors hit the right tone.",1295481600,2,220,5.314285714285714
8086379,5,B000BGN7WQ,"Once more we have here the most beloved French filmmaker in North America, Francois Truffaut, dealing with one of his favourite genres, the thriller. But the irreverent style in which it's told, the suggestive hints of humour, double sense and fine irony, enrich the script, enhancing it notably as a pleasant summer breeze.

You will understand why Truffaut is Truffaut after you watch it. It's useless to talk about the delicious performances of Jean Louis Trigtinant and Fanny Ardant in this amusing and innovative film.
