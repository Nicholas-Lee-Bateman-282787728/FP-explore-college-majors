8309782,5,B001HVZOE8,"I have never seen a so fantastic spectacle.

It is an intelligent and artistic combination of the Tschaikowski's Swan Lake with (let's say) the Bolshoi Ballet, the Circus of Moscow and the Canadian Cirque du Soleil (acrobatic circus). And all this magnificent arrangement having as background the traditional Chinese culture.

It is impossible to describe in words the ballet spectacle produced by the Chinese, mainly the very difficult accrobatic show presented by the artists.

The swan, the artist Wu Zhengdam, won the toppest prize in Russia. The director is Zhao Ming, and the prince is Wei Baohua.

It was well worth the purchase !
