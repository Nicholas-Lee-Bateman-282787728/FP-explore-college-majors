2697287,5,B000KSQJ7A,I was required to watch this in college (I am a teacher) and last year it was shown as a staff development workshop at my school.  I am amazed each time I watch this video as I can relate to what students experience in school.  I have a son who is now 22 and was identified as LD in 1st grade.  I cried the first time I watched this not realizing how he looked at the world or vice versa.  It really teaches adults what a learning disability is and how these students feel trying to overcome their obstacles.  This is a must see for parents who have a child with a disability and should be required every few years for teachers to view or review.,1230854400,,646,4.095238095238095
2697288,5,B000KSQJ7A,"I was shown this video while by ds was being screened for dyslexia and I have searched for it to own so I can share it with my own family and friends.  It is a PBS video and because they are so expensive, 49.95 at pbs site, I am still searching for a used copy and I will keep on as it was that good of a video.  I recommend that EVERY single person who teaches, works at any school, daycare, or church, even if not teaching watch this video.  Make sure you watch the 1989 version.  You'll regret not seeing it sooner.",1229040000,2,518,4.0
2697289,5,B000KSQJ7A,"This video changed my life.  A friend of mine loaned me her copy about 8 years ago, when my sons were diagnosed with ADHD.  This video helped me understand my children in a whole new way.  It made me more patient with them, and more compassionate.  It didn't preach at me or shame me -- it CHANGED me from the inside out.

Rick Lavoie is an incredibly gifted speaker and gifted educator.  But besides that, he is deeply passionate about unlocking the potential inside every human being, and he has a heart for those kids who are misunderstood because their learning differences make them, well, different.

In this fast-paced video, Lavoie leads a room full of adults through a series of hilarious exercises, which make them (and YOU) feel like they have various learning disabilities -- dyslexia, ADHD, discalculia, etc.  The exercises are very interesting and the participants are good sports. You can see the light bulb going on for each one as they feel what it's like to have a learning disability.

Lavoie demonstrates in a powerful way that what LD kids need is (1) time and (2) unconditional love.

I thank God that He put this video into my hands while my kids were still young. It kept me and my husband from destroying our kids' self-esteem through impatience or saying the wrong thing.  I sincerely wish that every teacher in America would watch this video.

For school districts, I would recommend the DVD. For people on a tight budget, you can buy the VHS from PBS for about fifty bucks.  It is one of their best-sellers.",1223337600,7,1535,4.661710037174721
2697290,5,B000KSQJ7A,"This video was recommended by someone from our state department of education as being a ""must-see"" for anyone in education.  Although it was directed toward the special education world, it is a must-see for everyone who works with children.  This is the single BEST video I have in our library and I have watched it at least 5 - 6 times in addition to showing it to teachers and aides at our school.  In fact, I try to watch it at least once a year to keep myself focused on how to help all children.  I moved to another school and wanted to purchase a copy for them, but the prices are about 3-4 times what I originally paid for a new copy 4 years ago.",1219449600,,653,4.158730158730159
2697291,5,B000KSQJ7A,"Rick Lavoi does an excellent job in bringing awareness about Learning Disablities to those that do not have one or do not have a child with one. If you do not have one or a child with one, you won't ever understand until you see this video. This should be a required video to watch for any teacher. My daughter with a LD was thrilled after watching the video. She realized she was not stupid and realized some self discoveries.",1215734400,2,427,4.35
2697292,5,B000KSQJ7A,"I have learning problems and I thought that this was the closest way one could get to understand what it is like to live with a learning problem of any kind.  Many people with auditory processing issues find that people talk too fast because their brains can't process what they hear the way they should or as fast as they should.  I have this problem.  In the video the listeners are spoken to at a fast speed and they clearly act nervous, frustrated and upset.  They are then told the way they are feeling is what it is like to live with a LD problem.  This is just one example, the adults were clearly changed by the experience.  They learned that saying things like, ""why can't you get this, this is easy"", would only makes things worse instead of being of any help.

Anyone that teaches at all should see this video.  I got my copy to view from the library.

2697293,5,B000KSQJ7A,"Wow...this video really opened my eyes about the challenges 'different' learners face...especially in the tea kettle called the classroom.

For these kids, forcing them to ""try harder"" is not only misguided, but downright unfair.

Kudos to Lavoie for this powerful experience...it's well worth the cost.",1187827200,18,303,5.711111111111111
2697294,5,B000KSQJ7A,I saw this at a workshop for Autism Spectrum Disorder. Richard Lavoie is a dynamic speaker and gave an excellent workshop. As the parent of an Asperger's child I came away with a better understanding of what my daughter must go through every day. PBS would do well to give it a wider release on DVD at a cheaper price than currently available here.,1172620800,35,348,4.453125
2697295,5,B000KSQJ7A,"I saw the video in grad school and it forever changed the way I view children with learning disabilities and how I teach and interact with all students.  (I am a regular ed kindergarten teacher.)  I was astounded that Richard LaVoie could create the disabilities in me while I watched.

I think that every school district should have this in their library.  It makes teachers more empathetic and therefore more effective for their students.",1171497600,21,440,4.905405405405405

2697320,5,B000KSQJ7A,"Since I have started my endeavor into education (almost 15 years ago), I think I have watched this workshop about half a dozen times, but it always seems like the room I am in, almost no one else has seen it. It is refreshing to see a workshop that is about 30 years old still have an impact on teachers today. As I say after every time I watch it, I hope that someone does an updated version of it. Dated, but still relevant.",1448668800,,426,4.083333333333333

2697324,5,B000KSQJ7A,"A must-watch for everyone working with struggling students.  Some of the tasks demonstrated imply less-than-accurate science (i.e., activities that make it appear that reading difficulties are primarily a visual problem rather than primarily a phonological processing problem).  However, this video does VERY well at capturing the frustration and anxiety that students with learning disabilities experience, even if it is not a scientific summary.",1442188800,,447,6.079365079365079

2697337,5,B000KSQJ7A,This is an amazing video and a true eyeopener. EVERYONE that works with children should have to watch this video. It totally brought tears to my eyes to actually be able to understand what these kids go through everyday of their lives. Its something that all parents should be able to watch also so they can have a better understanding of what kids go through. I have 6 children and my youngest has autism. He is very high functioning and is going to start school this year. I already have things going for every teacher and staff member to watch this video. I know this can help not only my son but many other children as well. It is well worth the money!,1434240000,3,656,4.341463414634147

2697339,5,B000KSQJ7A,"I saw this workshop years ago during my college years and never forgot the impact it left on me.  It will change your understanding of learning disabilities.  Richard conducts this workshop as a simulation and not as a role-playing activity.  To get the most out of this workshop, I'd recommend you participate in the simulations - have paper and pen ready, your remote to pause during each exercise, and a mirror.  Take your time.  Take several days to finish the workshop.  Live it.  You will come out as a more sympathetic person at the least, or an advocate for the learning disable as Richard hopes.",1428537600,4,604,4.695238095238095

2697345,5,B000KSQJ7A,This is an excellent video for anyone who wishes to work in the classroom with children. One of the most useful things is that watching the video gives the viewer just a small taste of how students with disabilities may feel in the classroom.

2697350,1,B000KSQJ7A,Despite the message I think it is utterly offensive to constantly refer to children with developmental disabilities as 'retarded.'  A video from 1989 is not acceptable in today's society.  Consistently allows a disability or disease to define the child (i.e. autistic child rather than child with autism).  Reinforced offensive vernacular throughout.,1410134400,,350,5.823529411764706

2697353,5,B000KSQJ7A,One of the best videos to watch if your child has learning issues at school. Watch carefully because all Mr. Lavoie does is increase the stress level and make all mistakes be the participants fault. It is one of the best examples of what happens when people are stressed out. The question then becomes - what is stressing out your child? What foundations are missing? How can we alleviate that stress? I use this video with every client. I think this video needs to be seen by every teacher in every school district in the nation. Communication is always 50% between the person you are talking to and the person who is listening. By changing our (instructor's) behavior & modifying our environment  we can modify most of the stress our clients/students are experiencing. I really enjoy Richard's examples and actionable helps. I'd rate this even higher if I could.,1407801600,2,864,4.798657718120805

We have all come across children who have difficulties sitting still and being quiet in certain situations and places such as super markets and restaraunts.  It's easy to judge the child and parent.  You may be thinking, my child would not behave like that!  Watching this workshop may help in understanding during these times.  I'm looking forward to seeing more of workshops like this one.

I don't have any learning disabilities, but people I know DO, and a review of this tape once in a while is very helpful in restoring the self equilibrium and balance that everyone should use in communicating and teaching other people.

2697418,5,B000KSQJ7A,His workshop really gave an excellent perspective of what an LD student goes through on a daily basis. As a teacher the idea of how we learn and how an LD student learns is very interesting. The best part about this video is when we gives general ideas on how to eliminate the ways we hinder LD student's. My favorite part was the comprehension section in the video; this could be used for any student in the classroom or child at home.

2697420,5,B000KSQJ7A,"I watched this video 8 years ago when my daughter had just been diagnosed with a learning disability and it left a huge impression on me, enough so that this year I purchased it to show to the teaching staff at the public elementary school where I teach. It is such a common misconception that we all make to assume that struggling students would do better if only they would try harder, if they weren't so lazy. This video is really effective at exposing the reality of what school and learning really looks-and feels-like from the perspective of students with learning disabilities. I know I look at struggling students differently (including my own children) now that I have seen this and I hope that my staff will gain some understanding and empathy too.",1358208000,,758,4.706766917293233

Even though the footage (and some of the terminology) is a bit dated, how Lavoie presents learning disabilities to a room full of stakeholders is a moving experience for the viewer and created learning experiences for my students that we were able to refer to throughout the semester. People who may not fully understand the issues students with learning disabilities face will gain a lot from watching, processing, and discussing the ideas presented in this video. I can say a number of classrooms in our area have changed for the positive as a result of Lavoie's video.",1354924800,,760,4.809160305343512

Rick LaVoie is an engaging speaker. The participation of real people (parents, students, teachers, administrators, business professionals)  in the video and the real classroom environment he presents really brings home how difficult well meaning teachers, ed techs, and parents make school for our LD kids.

I have plenty of patience, but this video opened my eyes and helped me understand some of the disabilities much better than any textbook could.

2697440,4,B000KSQJ7A,This is an excellent video for helping people to understand what a person with learning difficulties goes through every single day.  The only complaint is the very high price makes it inaccessible to many people who really need to see it.  To pay three to five times what a multi-million dollar Hollywood production costs for something that cost nothing to produce (and should be a public service) tragically limits the help it could render to so many.  The producers should be more interested in helping children rather than making a profit on the suffering of others.,1301270400,5,569,4.90625

We were shown this video in a class for my ElEd program, and even if I were to learn nothing else in the class, the understanding I gained from watching this video was worth my tuition money.  Mr. Lavoie does a great job in helping us to understand what a school day must be like for a child with learning disabilities.  The video is broken up into small sections that simulate differences in perception, problems with decoding and comprehension, motor-visual coordination, and others.

Mr. Lavoie effectively uses analogies to help us see how bizarre some of the instructions given to learning disabled kids can be.  He also defines ""fair"" in a way that makes sense.",1287360000,5,748,4.858267716535433

Richard Lavoie's training sessions on what it's like to be a learning disabled student are not only clear, practical, and moving, but they are applicable for any kind of parent-child or person-to-person teaching or training. And learning-disabled doesn't have to be part of it. Lavoie conveys two basic principles: people learn differently from each other, and only practical responses to those differences will help. No amount of pressure, motivation, threats, rewards, pleading, or disbelief will do it. Think you would never try those ""solutions"" at home or at work? Watch the video. Lavoie also tells you how to do it right. It's so obvious once you see it.",1266710400,2,801,4.985074626865671

My son has a very high IQ but had difficulty in school...the old 'work harder' 'pay attention' style of teaching did nothing for us...even I was stuck in that mentality until I saw this video....it's been more than ten years since I saw it for the first time and I watch again from time to time to remind myself that 'fair' doesn't really mean the same for everyone...thank you Mr. Lavoie,1265846400,11,614,4.491071428571429

2697454,4,B000KSQJ7A,"This is an outstanding presentation by a very bright and capable educator. I would have given it 5 stars were it not for some production problems related to the original taping.

Lavoie takes a group of people through a series of exercises designed to give ""normal"" people an idea of what it is like to have learning differences (LD). The exercises are remarkably effective and amazingly enlightening. He also dispels myths and discusses common errors teachers and parents make in teaching and communicating with children (and adults, for that matter).

The exercises take one through experiences dealing with processing problems, memory problems, perceptual differences, motor function problems, reading problems, and behavioral challenges.

While there are some obvious problems with the sound at times (probably malfunctioning wireless mics in the original recordings), the material is still extremely valuable and well worth the minor inconvenience of the sound issues.

I first saw this while running the control room for a distance class in Special Education. Since the love of my life has multiple learning differences, the impact on me was particularly strong. I actually cried as I watched, realizing just how incredibly difficult her life must be. I have since seen it many times again, and purchased my own copy. I will soon be buying another copy, as I gave mine to a relative who teaches, who also loved it.

While somewhat dated (notice the width of ties and lapels), it is an extremely important work, especially given the increase in such problems today. It is still very powerful and relevant today. This program has helped make me an advocate for LD people.

However, this is not just for educators or those who know LD people. I think every business and organization should have their employees watch it, especially customer service folks, as it would be extremely helpful for them to understand the behavior and problems of many people. Since it has been shown that up to 80% of the people in prison have learning differences, it would be good for law enforcement and related people as well. In fact, I think it should be shown to everyone on a regular basis.

Learning differences are not the same as mental retardation, a common mistake many people not in Special Ed make. I like to use the example of color blindness to try and explain this to people - these are errors in processing perceptual and memory data that are simply not under the control of the person, just like being color blind. No amount of sarcasm, shouting, punishing, or ""motivating"" these people will change what they cannot physically process, PERIOD. You have to be a better, wiser person than that.

Given the massive amount of ""moral"" and related misjudgments society heaps on those who are different, I consider this material extremely important, and I heartily encourage everyone to watch it at least once. I owe Lavoie a tremendous debt of gratitude for what this information has done in my life, something I imagine he hears a lot. I have also learned a lot from the professor who introduced me to it. The world needs more people who care this much.

By the way, give yourself a pat on the back if you get the first perception test (fuzzy picture) without his direct instruction. My significant other (LD) got it instantly.....I didn't.",1242432000,13,3336,4.953488372093023

I have given or loaned copies of the DVD to many of those involved in my grandson's high school education.  It shows that LD folks are not necessarily stupid or obstinate, but that they learn differently than many of the mainstream students.

It was after watching this film and realizing just how different the world is, to how dyslexic people perceive things was vastly different than everyone else.  As an artist, dyslexia is why I became so good in my career.

This film explains how vastly different the dyslexic person experiences the world.  The truth of the film is so shocking for someone who is dyslexic, that I have purchased this film over 10x and given it to people whose families don't understand why they are so different if they are extremely dyslexic.  As an adult who is the CEO of a company, this film is required viewing for every employee.

There have been multiples times when a new employee, after watching this film, is crying at the end of the film.  They suddenly realize that someone they know is dyslexic and how wrong they were about the impressions of what the dyslexic person was doing.
