8572137,5,B00BPBTHK2,"A very fun rom-com with more finesse and better writing than most. Sexy and charming lead actors, and even the supporting parts are well done. I especially liked one scene where there is a romantic dinner. Instead of the usual setting, they sneak into a modernist building masterpiece, and he tells her its fascinating background. That's the kind of nice touch and added dimension this film is full of. It has heart and doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence, while still being a good romp with lots of great comic moments and lines.",1473638400,,535,4.826086956521739
