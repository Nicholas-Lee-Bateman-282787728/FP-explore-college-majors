8082319,5,B000B69TEG,"Although this isn't a history channel production with a history channel budget, the content of this series is outstanding. What I appreciate are the stories of early black figures who are rarely mentioned in American history. The episodes are less than 30 minute, which leaves enough time for discussions. We are viewing this series at the Senior Retirement home where I work. It has been extremely popular. I recommend this series as an educational tool for all ages.",1517529600,2,468,5.012820512820513

8082326,4,B000B69TEG,"My DVR broke so I thought I'd take the time to look at some of the many dvd's I have in my collection.  This set, although a bit tedious in its presentation (repetitive uninspiring music, uninspiring host....), has solid information and a short video clips so that you can sit for the entire session or watch over a series of small periods of time (i.e. if you are watching with younger children).  The video format is also user friendly a school environment.  I learned a great many details from this set - so many that I've recommended that other people borrow and\or buy it.  Just make sure you don't let the presentation style scare you off.  It is worth your time!",1309737600,3,669,4.4958677685950414
