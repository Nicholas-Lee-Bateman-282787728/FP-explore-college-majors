920090,5,6304707606,"Tulsa, Tokyo, and the Middle of Nowhere is an awesome movie - you get to see the guys and best of all hear the music. We also get to see where the  guys were during their world tour, which really rocks, plus you might even  see yourself in it! Great movie, great music. Definitely recommended,  although I suppose you wouldn't enjoy it if you don't like Hanson's music.",966643200,,369,4.397058823529412

7876688,5,6304707606,"If you're a hanson fan, get this immediatley and don't go anywhere! If you're a new Hanson fan you may be the age they were in this film so you may want to get it anyway, or just to learn a bit of history of the band.  For the rest of us, besides the pure awesomeness that is Hanson, it's nostalgic- and a backup becuase most of us can't play our VHS' anymore!  It came within a reasonable amount of time and was in good condition, played perfectly.  Who knows what people are going to come out with next...I think we need it digitally...",1362009600,,538,4.153846153846154

I think Taylor is Still My Fave even though He's Married and got kids,He'll Always Be my fave In my Heart & Soul.
When I saw Zac in A white room which is Part of ""Where's the Love"",Screamin the title of that song @ the Camera,I thought it was funny but Priceless & I Love it!!!!.i'm Glad I got the Dvd & I'm NEVER Goin 2 get rid of it :)",1299110400,,547,3.892857142857143

This is AWESOME dude! All hanson fans should see this its SOOOO funny...u should buy it for 74.99 EVEN IF you don't have a vhs player! NEVER sell it in a yard sale like kathie douglas!!!! Its a great documentary for years to come! It will go down in history as a classic vidgeo (vid-gee-oh) I recommend it to all asians, caucasions, blacks, and spaniards! I don't recommend it to northwestern indians due to the lack of footage in their continent! BUT to all others PLEASE buy this VHS. HANSON LIIIIIVES! P.S. Taylor I will always love you, I will always be waiting!",1278633600,,779,5.7155172413793105
7876691,5,6304707606,"This video is flat-out awesome.  Those Hanson boys do some crazy things!  From the footage of touring around the world (""in Frahnce, haha!""), to clips of them interacting as a family (""We love each other!"")it is so much fun to watch.  Also, the two music videos (MMMbop and Where's the Love) are excellent.  You will not be disappointed with TTAMON.",1099699200,5,349,4.766666666666667

From Ike's ""documentary"" of redwood trees (Hi, my name is Joe...) lmao, to the end where they all fight, while talking about not fighting.  Wow... now I want to go watch it.  Unfortunately, I have the VHS, so I'm gonna buy the dvd... the vhs is all messed up from watching it so much.  So... funny....
you will love it.",1089763200,,425,4.2625
7876693,5,6304707606,This video is the classic Hanson at their best. You aren't a true fan if you haven't seen this video... at least a dozen times!,1079049600,2,127,4.12
7876694,5,6304707606,That is the best way to describe this movie. I own the VHS and it is one of my favorite Hanson items. It gives you a look into the world of the boys. Full of hilarious scenes between Ike & Zac and concert footage - even interviews. I cannot stress enough the necessity of this movie for any Hanson fan!,1064275200,,302,4.05
