7871406,4,6304432550,"I received this item and wrapped it and gave it as a gift to 2 small children, ages 5 and 7.  They opened it and found that one of the four items was missing.  That is, it was four videos and one of the covers was empty.  The children kept the 3 that were included.  I took the empty cover and contacted Amazon.  I was told that I must return the entire package for refund.  I did not want a refund, I wanted the missing video sent to me.  I am not going to tell the 2 little children that they have to return their gift.  Amazon may keep that item, I will do without it and look for the item that was missing, elsewhere.  I am not happy with Amazon's handling of this order.  I will be very surprised if I find this review on Amazon.",1255824000,2,734,3.931972789115646
7871407,3,6304432550,"The only reason this would be worth it is for the first one. The one Don Bluth Directed. For some reason right with the second one it turns into a meaningless musical that is afraid to do anything like the original did.
So Find the first one and get that because I would probably burn the extra 3 that comes with it.",1186358400,,316,4.112903225806452
7871408,5,6304432550,I loved these videos I only own one but I plan on collecting them all.  They do not sell them anymore in the stores where I live so I will probably order them from amazon.,924912000,4,171,3.8857142857142857
