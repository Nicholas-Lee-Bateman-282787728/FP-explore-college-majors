7868051,5,6304341679,"The first time I saw this film, I fell in love with it. Every time since then, have only liked its nuances more and more.

It's a dark, tongue in cheek comedy about aliens taking on human identities temporarily (and badly), trying to find the perfect human match for them to assume. Has some wonderful, little scenes that are so, so reminiscent of the 50's, but much more gore 9(done in an amusing way) and sex than the 50's ever got away with.

Definitely something not to miss for lovers of sci-fi, especially if you like a comedic twist. Great stuff! ! !",1275782400,,557,4.398058252427185
7868052,3,6304341679,"Disgusting little film about 2 aliens who skin human beings in order to walk among us unseen. The movie beautifully introduces the characters and the ol' boring town 'Tranquility' where all those strange killings take place. The 2 characters Anita Clark (Joanna Pacula) & her husband Sam (Peter Onorati) suspect what's underneath the newcomers' skin could be deadly!
Below average: Produced by schlock meister Roger Corman.",1033430400,3,423,5.424242424242424
