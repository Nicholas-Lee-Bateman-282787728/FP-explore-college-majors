8453447,5,B00520L2D2,"I call this a small documentary because the subject matter is covered in about an hour without any unsatifying gaps. The subject matter is presented by those who favor the practice as well as those who are dubious of the benefits. In spite of what another viewer suggests there are very graphic visual depictions of the process involved the most thorough of which is in a very primitive setting. I might well have found these depictions intolerably disturbing were I not so fascinated by the process Itself as well as curious as to what benefits the procedure might be able to offer to me.

The most shocking revelations were in the testimony of those who claimed to have successfully performed the procedure upon themselves. I do not doubt the veracity of their testimony. I can imagine circumstances which, over time, could adapt a person sincere in their desires to accumulate the self-assuredness as well as the finesse to accomplish the task for themselves. Clearly the avoidance of intervention would be the motive. These self-healers are clearly desirous of the procedure to bring them a desired effect rather than wishing to become famous ""freaks"" by the ordeal.

This documentary is of value to anyone who takes so-called fringe ideas seriously. I found the film while seeking the video footage of the African ritual which dates back to a mondo film from decades ago. To find that footage as well as so much more modern testimony was a pleasure and a surprise.

I will be glad to have a copy of this film for myself as I am certain that this is a subject to be revisited. (Five stars out of a possible five stars)",1506038400,,1622,4.724381625441696
8453448,1,B00520L2D2,incorret item.  Thought I was ordering the movie of the same name with Frank Sinatra.  I returned it and am awaiting a refund,1414540800,,125,4.391304347826087
8453449,5,B00520L2D2,"this documentary is about a very ancient practice of ""brain improvment"" involving the drilling of a small hole
into ones skull, usually the front just above the pinneal gland. do NOT expect a graphic demonstration anywhere on the dvd, because this is an educational film giving a fair and equal explanation from both advocates and detractors
in medical and patient communities. i WILL NOT go into the details of the method by which this is done because it is NOT my right to do so and furthermore, after seeing this myself, i had come to based on my own view of sanity
decide that i DO NOT condone this very radical medical procedure be done by just anybody, because if the surgical
procedure is executed with the slightest mistake a person can die from it. the cost to get this done is very high and many states in our union and various other countries have apparently outlawed this rare form of brain surgery to protect the common public good, making this right of passsge among adults incredibly spotty.

after thinking long and hard about the affects this procedure has on the human brian, though i am not a member of any faith and personally do not believe in religion, i would probably get into scientology rather than try this.

please understand, this documentary should be treated by most people as a rare glimpse into the world of a said
dangerous method of conscience expansion, most medical hospitals flat out refuse to perform due to how unorthodox
it really is. i did enjoy watching this as a personal education project, but i would not loan this dvd out to just anybody, due to the odd looks which could be casted ones way and choose to keep this to myself.",1327968000,,1672,4.60738255033557

But the thing is well-directed and professionally edited:  it's not some home movie (although it was filmed on video).

It was very satisfying:  when you're done with it, you'll have the feeling that you definitely know what is what with trepanation.  I particularly liked how the documentary struck a balance between skeptical doctors and enthusiastic advocates, with the common ground being a desire for clinical, peer-reviewed research.

Before ordering, I thought it was basically a film on an anthropological subject.  In other words, I thought it was a history of trepanation in ancient societies and so forth.  No:  its chief focus is contemporary people doing this to themselves despite the best medical evidence.

It could easily have been longer:  I wish they had followed the daily lives of the trepanees a bit more:  what do they do for a living, etc.",1327881600,,986,4.975460122699387
