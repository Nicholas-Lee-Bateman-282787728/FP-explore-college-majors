Electricity  in  grocery  stores  would  only  last  about  10  days  to  2  weeks.  After  that  electric  motors,  generators,  power  plants,  start  shutting  down.  &  some  dogs  &  cats  try  to  survive  but  only  the  best  will  carry  on  without  us.  Others  will  die.  &  yes  its  a  terrific  story  &  exactly  what  would  happen  in  your  local  grocery  store  to  all  the  food.  Big  difference  in  the  way  a  grocery  store  would  look  20  to  30  to  50  to  100  years  from  now.  Pretty  good  footage  about  the  land  &  vegetation  reclaiming  all  the  cities  in  the  world.  I  have  seen  this  show  on  the  History  channel  many  times.  The  pictures  are  amazing.  All  the  other  creatures  in  the  world  suddenly  in  a  struggle  to  survive  for  as  long  as  they  can  without  us,  those  that  were  closest  to  us,  dogs, cats, horses  &  whatever  else  goats, cows, pigs.  Who'd  have  ever  thought  you'd  be  able  to  watch  the  statue  of  Liberty  fall  apart,  or  look  at  a  church  or  an  elementary  school  after  its  been  deserted  30  years  from  now?  I  look  forward  to  buying  seasons  1  &  2  together  as  quick  as  they  have  more  information.  How  much  it  costs  &  how  many  hours  it  has!
I  would  love  to  get  this  on  DVD!  Fascinating  TV  Show!!!!!!!!!!",1478044800,,1535,4.2682926829268295
