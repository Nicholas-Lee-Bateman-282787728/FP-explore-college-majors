It keeps you at the edge of your seat, gripping suspense, nail-biting scenes, causes goosebumps - overall, it is worth your money!
One of my favourite movies of all time!!! I was ""s*** scared"" after watching this movie...
If you are a hardcore HORROR fan then you have to watch this!",1473379200,,320,4.517241379310345

8544119,1,B009SLANP4,"I ordered this movie from a very reliable Amazon merchant and I thought I would receive a standard version of the movie since it was not mentioned anywhere that it was the 3D version. I was surprise to receive the 3D version on a DVD with two pairs of glasses included. To avoid the trouble of returning it, I decided to give it a try. Let me say that this 3D version on DVD is a pure piece of crap. It is almost unwatchable with or without the glasses included. Without the glasses included, the picture is blurred. With the glasses included and on the top of it if you are already wearing glasses, it is really a pain to watch this movie till the end and you can hardly see the 3D effect. Otherwise, without the 3D this movie would not be a bad one. This is really a very cheap and very bad use of the 3D feature.",1364342400,2,815,4.1
8544120,3,B009SLANP4,"Shanaya Shekhar ( Bipasha Basu) is the old guard in Bollywood who is gradually losing ground to the younger and rising Sanjana( Eesha Gupta) The last straw is when Shanaya loses the best actress award to  Sanjana. Shanaya is religious but decides that it is time to worship the dark side. Together with her boy friend ( Emraan Hashmi) and an evil spirit ( Manish Choudhary), plans to make life a hell for Sanjana are set in motion. However, Emraan falls for Shanaya and thus hampers Sanjanas plans.

The Bhatts have successfully launched and executed several movie franchises such as Raaz, Jism, Haunted and Murder. Raaz 3 is another successful continuation of the franchise. People ridicule these films but audiences love them. These films have a lot of thrills and excitement and don't tax the brain too much. If you do like complex plots then this is not the film for you. A decent one time watch. Three stars.",1362268800,,913,4.735849056603773
