8172621,1,B000MV8BDA,This video was absolutely awful.  I expected performances and all I got was the same music on everything and no Elvis singing.  What a disappointment!!  This return policy said to return it it had to be unopened.  I threw it away.,1344384000,,230,4.536585365853658
8172622,4,B000MV8BDA,"The only thing I didn't like was the Madison Square Gardens press conference was not complete and Elvis does not sing in any segment.  I don't think that's the producer""s fault, though, EPE probably wouldn't allow it.

I had never heard some of the interviews before and it was nice to hear Elvis' voice and not some actor's.

It is pretty expensive when you look at the cost of some other DVD's.  I am still looking for one the has the complete Houston and Madison Square Gardens press conferences on it.

I also very much enjoyed the footage from the Ten Outstanding Young Men Prayer Breakfast.  Seeing a young George Bush. Sr. was a surprise.",1214784000,3,645,4.565217391304348
