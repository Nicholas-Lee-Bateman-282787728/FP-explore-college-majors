6015407,5,B00FN93T6U,"I caught this film at a preview screening last June, not knowing what to expect it was a pleasant surprise.
The story is told beautifully capturing the essence of youth through the characters of George, Paul and Angharad. Paul is on Holiday with his overpowering mother in Wales and soon meets George and is pulled into a land of dreams, fantasy and escape. The campsite daughter Angharad is never far behind them adding humour in some very touching scenes.
George and Paul plan to meet back at the campsite a year later and run away, one year later, Paul returns and George does not, what follows is the darker half of the film which shows the reality of dreams and youth. I loved the comic book feel to the film, and the story is told through the total innocence of Paul. It's refreshing to see Britian making gay films and focusing on good storytelling ! This is a must buy for fans of British cinema and LGBT cinema!",1382918400,18,920,4.482142857142857

6015415,3,B00FN93T6U,"I have to agree with other commenters who indicated that this film is a bit amateurish, somewhat predictable and not a little trite, yet, despite it's flaws, I ended up being surprised that I sort of liked it overall.  It wasn't a captivating film and though it tried in the most brazen and melodramatic of ways, it didn't wrest any deep emotions from me, but for some reason I found it to be fairly entertaining. The leads, Bradley Cross and Joe Gosling were pretty easy on the eyes and though the writing didn't really demand great depth from it's characters, I was pleased to see each turn in a few solid scenes with a measure of gravitas.  And, some of the supporting actors turned in decent scenes too.  I certainly wouldn't place this film in the same arena as Beautiful Thing, but it did cause me to think of that terrific film, and though the story of Paul and George was no where near as compelling as that of Jamie and Ste, it was a bit touching and not really that bad overall.  To quote an old saying, 'it was rentable'.",1418774400,3,1032,4.387434554973822

_____________________________________

I am just really sick of gay-themed movies where someone has to die.  I suppose I can sort of kind of understand why this was done 30 or 40 or 50 years ago but I don't understand why these filmmakers persist in this today.  I know that life isn't all fluffy teddy bears and roses but give me a break already.",1407283200,14,372,4.676923076923077
6015417,1,B00FN93T6U,"This is a dismal film.  The script is amateurish.  The story is melodrama.  Every character in it is made excessive and extreme.  Paul's mother is a harridan.  George's father is a besotted alcoholic.  The girlfriend of the two lads is a tart.  The barkeep in the Welsh town is, as it turns out, a dominatrix with a girlfriend who grovels.  Paul is almost unbelievably naive and innocent.  George, once he begins his fall, falls all the way down.  Many of the other characters might be right for farce.  But this film, formerly a play, means to touch on deep and serious matters.  Yet, when it becomes necessary for the plot, the mother turns from a bitch into a sweet and gentle hearted soul once you get to know her.  I don't mean that precisely.  I mean that the sentimentality of this movie seems to have no control over itself.  Hearts of gold, at least toward the end, start shining.  I don't know why so many gay-themed movies of recent vintage (though this one is set in 1987) repeat the gloom and glumness of another, more troubled time.  Even in '87, even in Wales and Northern England then, there were other worlds, other images to find.  Yes (spoiler alert), Paul does break free at the end and, as he says, finds his own voice.  But this, too, is the release of melodrama.  In characters so close to caricature throughout the movie no real freedom is possible.  They are bound by the melodramatic trappings in which they have been tied by their playwright and director.  Paul's big move is as sentimental as was George's death.  It means to tug the heartstrings.  But it all comes too cheaply, derivatively, without real imagination.",1386201600,10,1646,4.615916955017301
8617121,5,B00FN93T6U,"You will either love or hate this comic-book take on young love.  When you are a teenager, everything about being in love is melodrama.  For my money, this film captures that beautifully. Great acting by most of the characters.",1530921600,,227,4.794871794871795
8617122,5,B00FN93T6U,"Minus a half star. Bradley Cross, a terrific actor, is not convincing when it comes to being 17 years old. He looks no younger than his mother.
As an adaption of a play to screen, the seaside location and the shabby buildings are a striking setting. The camera work is excellent. Eventually the age of the actors is irrelevant. Strong emotions are convincingly acted and the cast and production draw the viewer in.
Deeply movingk memorable characters brought to life. Some vivid and completely memorable scenes.
Eyre-Morgan brought a fine script to life for us.",1496793600,2,561,4.91578947368421
8617123,2,B00FN93T6U,"It looks shyly appealing at firstthen rapidly spirals and skids into a hopelessly turgid and overwrought tangle of clichs--perhaps more forgivable in the 1980's.  But in 2013? No way!  Too bad.  The two lads have both charm and talent, but their gifts are squandered on bad writing and bad direction.  The mother is a travesty . . . and I'll stop here, because it's a buzzkil to think about how far these (one suspects) booze-hound filmmakers missed the mark and wasted everybody's time.

8617124,4,B00FN93T6U,"Very low budget, but it has a certain magic. The cast is lovable, and does the best they can with the awkward dialogue and low budget sets. A bit tough at times to understand the dialogue through the thick accents, but it's kind of charming. The plot of sweet at first, and kind of slow moving, but the second half of the movie delves deeper into darker themes of alcohol abuse, a dead beat dad, an overbearing mother, and a relationship brought to a heartbreaking end. The film ends on a bitter-sweet note with the remembrance off a loved one lost, and the celebration of a voice found setting off to follow a dream.",1485993600,3,617,4.421052631578948

It's about not letting some of the ugly parts of life hold you back. Good or bad, we will only be happy if we take changes and be true to ourselves. Yes, life isn't always easy.
