When You are working to enlighten people and charing knowledge that you have came to a conclusion because of others work to create your own.

7544722,1,B018AXRM6I,"This guy is really awful. He makes very huge leaps with data, correlating data together as causal when they are in fact not related or at best not KNOWN to be related. He is also misinformed about history. He is not an enlightened individual and would not recommend this to anyone since it provides a lot of false information as facts. While the truths he did find are good, he came up with a lot of bad information to justify it. Watch Inner Worlds Outer Worlds 4 part series instead for actual truths and scientific facts.",1465171200,3,524,4.46875

This guy makes claims his friend carried a name of a guy he want dead so he cursed him by placing a name on a chicken and after a week the cursed person died.  This guy claims he witnessed it.  Laughable.  I don't know how i stumbled onto this prgram maybe cause the words Secret, Universe and the fact it was new made me curious.  For the folks who don't believe in superstition and other godly phenomenon i advise you to not waste your time.",1463875200,,462,4.146067415730337
7544725,1,B018AXRM6I,"He lost me at ""We all come from stars..."" (say what?) Perhaps these beliefs are part of a religion I am not even vaguely familiar with. Perhaps I am so far from enlightenment that I am doomed to return to the earth (which is probably going to end soon according to this guy!!!!!! sorry for the spoiler...) many many times. But I'm ok with that. Perhaps on my 100th return to earth as a cockroach, powerpoint presentations (such as this guy's) will have improved drastically. However, as excited as said guy was about propelling forward with personal growth and never returning to earth again, his powerpoint skills probably set him back a few caste systems. Wait. I'm combining religions...well, I think you understand what I'm saying nonetheless.",1459900800,3,747,4.889763779527559
7544726,1,B018AXRM6I,"I want my 30 minutes back... I say 30 minutes because that's about all I could stomach. This low budget powerpoint was nothing more than unbacked up statements that this person claimed were facts backed up by more of the same. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but as the presentation moved forward he started going into ridiculousness that eventually led my mind to start thinking ""Why am I continuing to watch this silliness?"" If you like watching hyperbole and gazing into the mind of a semi-creative storyteller then you might enjoy this. But if you think this is real... then I have some high value land for sale in south west florida for very cheap.",1459641600,4,666,4.558333333333334

Mitchel Earl Gibson MD appears to be a fine educator, bringing attention to some very important aspects of energy, how it works an can work to help each of us better our lives.

8741965,5,B018AXRM6I,"This was thought provoking, and he's definitely well spoken and easy to listen to. I would be interested in listening to more of his seminars. It seems like his teachings are from a combination of different ancient cultures and religions. Volume 1 doesn't go into enough detail on the energies, prayers, or gates to start practicing anything though.",1515024000,,349,5.0344827586206895

I found that difficult to believe (Mercury is 35 million miles from the sun) and so I did a quick google search. The spacecraft was in fact in Earth orbit, not in an independent orbit around the sun as implied. Sorry, but once you state something as fact that is so completely WRONG, whatever else you have to say is highly suspect and therefore the ""documentary"" is no longer worth watching.",1488240000,8,525,4.479166666666667
