2566848,5,B000FI9OF4,"An amazing 3 hour doc. on the greatest season of one of the NFL's least known and unlucky teams. In 2005 The seattle seahawks made a noise so loud they could no longer be ingnored. Setting a NFC record of 13-3 and harbering the League MVP Shean Alaxander with 28 touchdowns. The seahawks have been plaqued with failure since thier 1976 introduction into the NFL as an expasion team. For years the Seahawks had no titles and had never won a playoff game, in 05' that changed. This documantary of my Favorite Team in Professional Sports Chronicles the greatest season in franchise history and the begining of 4 year davision champion team.
Currently the Seahawks have clentched the NFC West Title 4 years in a row and i have high expectations for the 08-09 season.",1197244800,,762,4.651851851851852
2566849,5,B000FI9OF4,"This is an excellent video capturing our best season and post season. We are original
season ticket holders, over 31years and throughly enjoyed this dvd. We actually rented it
first and then purchased.  It also documents how well we got ripped in the Super Bowl by
the ref's.",1189900800,5,275,4.729166666666667
2566850,5,B000FI9OF4,"2005 was the Seattle Seahawks best season to date. They were the best team in the NFL that year, and that was demonstrated to the world when they wiped up Detroit's Ford Field with the Pittsburgh Steelers on February 5, 2006. The ONLY thing that saved the Steelers that day was the officiating.

The DVD contains virtually everything a Seahawks fan would want it to contain. A review of every game of the regular season and the playoffs, the full half-hour NFL Game of the Week presentation of the NFC Championship Game against the Carolina Panthers. There are mini-documentaries about the Seahawks 2005 training camp, Mike Holmgren's career, Kenny Easley, Steve Largent, and a genuinely moving story about linebacker Isaiah Kacyvenski's rough life growing up in rural New York.

The only disappointment with the DVD was beyond the control of the makers of the DVD: HOW do you present to Seahawks fans the NFL championship game that was openly and deliberately thrown to the Steelers through biased officiating? There was no getting around it. The game was a complete, total, and utter travesty of justice and sportsmanship, and I lost a tremendous amount of respect for the NFL that day.",1186790400,7,1188,4.935
2566851,5,B000FI9OF4,"Excellent; the best DVD there is covering the 2005-2006 Seahwawk season.

Great coverage of play off games including the Super Bowl, and tons of cool extra content.",1163030400,3,164,5.074074074074074
2566852,5,B000FI9OF4,The 2005 season for the Seattle Seahawks was an amazing year.  This video truly captures the excitement that was the most successful year in Seahawks history.,1162512000,4,158,5.076923076923077
2566853,5,B000FI9OF4,"What has it been now - five years of watching the season-end Super Bowl DVD's?  Unbelievable.  How time flies when you're having fun!

I've always enjoyed those Super Bowl DVD's.  Granted, they were only about 60 minutes in length.  But to see the winning team's season recapped game-by-game was enjoyable year after year, especially because I never had time to watch games during the actual season.

I never believed I'd see the day when my Seattle Seahawks received a season-ending review of their own.  When they went to the Super Bowl last year, I hoped beyond reason that they would win it all, if only to see them get their own DVD.  When the Pittsburgh Officials, I mean Steelers, beat them soundly, I thought, ""that was it, that was their chance.  Now I'll never see a season-ending recap"".  Lo and behold, I was wrong.  Thank you NFL Films for releasing this 2005 NFC Champions DVD.

The DVD itself is worth the money (and worth the wait for us diehard fans).  In addition to the 60-minute season recap, NFL Films also included the NFC Championship game as the ""Game of the Week"".  Add to that a few mini-features, subtitles (the NFL is one of the only sports establishments to utilize them), and miscellaneous promos, and you have yourself a fine summary of the glory that was the Seahawks 2005-2006 season.

And for all who doubted the ""officials wanting the Steelers to win"" conspiracy theory (I counted myself one who doubted that as well)...  watch this video, and the representation of Super Bowl XL contained within, and see if you don't have second thoughts.  I know I do.

Good luck Seahawks in 2006-2007!",1154649600,18,1623,4.715302491103203
2566854,5,B000FI9OF4,It was great watching the game again. You can see how we got the penalties  the same ones Pittsburgh didn't get. We got cheated out of winning that game. Matt Hasslebeck a great quarter back.,1399680000,,191,4.457142857142857
2566855,5,B000FI9OF4,It may not have ended how we liked but you have to start your Super Bowl collection at the beginning. Only one of many now that we have won the big one (SB48). Go Hawks!!!,1398297600,,171,3.914285714285714
2566856,5,B000FI9OF4,My husband the Seahawks fan thought this DVD was nice to watch and put together well.  Nice collection with his other championship items.,1394409600,,137,4.956521739130435
2566857,5,B000FI9OF4,As a Seahawk fan it is great to have a copy of the 2005 season and the 1st attempt in the Super Bowl as part of our collection.,1394150400,,127,3.5714285714285716
2566858,5,B000FI9OF4,"I relieved the season all over again...  It only seems like yesterday when the Seahawks went to the superbowl and got robbed, ""THANKS REFS""....  But when I watch the footage and see the old Uniforms and players.. it seems like a LONG time ago.  =)

All die hard Seahawks fans should get this for their collection.",1384992000,,313,4.535714285714286
2566859,5,B000FI9OF4,I'm a big Seahawks fan and I love this DVD maybe soon there will be another DVD when we go to the Super Bowl again,1367107200,,114,3.6
2566860,5,B000FI9OF4,"For a Seahawks fan, this was the year to remember. It was such a heartfelt, amazing season for fans. Unfortunately, it had the wrong ending. Either way, this DVD reminds me of the good (regular season + post season) and the bad (when we got the shaft at the SuperBowl).

Glad I have this to add to my collection. A true fan would love this!",1270857600,,340,4.230769230769231
2566861,4,B000FI9OF4,"When I bought this, I thought it was going to show all the games from the 2005 season. Instead, it shows brief highlights from each game. It was still really cool to watch...though the Superbowl loss was still just as disappointing as I remembered.",1244419200,,248,4.659090909090909
2566862,5,B000FI9OF4,"This was a good DVD, provided some historical context to the Seahawks season and a lot of coverage on Alexander and the Offensive line. I didn't like the Sabol line about the Seahawks being the most anonymous team in the NFL. How about Arizona and Detroit or even New Orleans.",1219708800,,276,4.54
2566863,5,B000FI9OF4,"This is a good DVD for anyone who has never paid any attention to the Seahawks before 2005, which is basically most of the NFL's fans. I like the way it shows the Seahawks blasting through a 13-3 season, including 11 straight wins. It shows good reactions of the opposing sideline's coaches and players when they know it's all over. This DVD glosses over the horrible officiating in Super Bowl XL. I'm not going to say that's the ONLY reason Seattle lost that game, but it certainly took away a lot of their points, and therefore took the fight out of them toward the end of the game. My final word on the Super Bowl is that soon after, head coach Mike Holmgren publicly commented that he was surprised that his team had to play the guys in the striped shirts as well as Pittsburgh, which is basically publicly calling the NFL officials corrupt and unfair, and he was NOT fined by the NFL. What does that tell you?
Anyway, back to the DVD.. There are a lot of funny extras from the sidelines that you'd never hear otherwise, such as QB Matt Hasselbeck commenting to a ref about a booger in his nose right before the coin toss at the Super Bowl, and how poor Matt responds to a bee sting in training camp. Also lots of opposing players BSing with the Seahawks in a friendly way that you don't see too much. It's a good DVD overall, well worth the cost, which is not that much anyway.",1200700800,10,1382,4.33976833976834
