8530636,5,B008UXZXH4,"I gave inuyasha 5 stars, because me and my family love this cartoon...I'm glad they finally got the last ones the final act the only problem I have is that the people that was the voice for the actors is not the same people...I hate watching a cartoon and then when a new one come out the voice is different.",1363824000,3,308,4.15
8530637,3,B008UXZXH4,"I feel a tad ripped off. For the price it's not surprising that it would be such a disappointment. The cases are cheap and flimsy, the discs often skip and the Final Act isn't even dubbed with the official version. Really, it sounds god awful.  I'm going to purchase the Final Act from another vendor. If I get the same result as this I will return it. For a sham, the main series isn't bad at all. But the Final Act is worse than a fandub! My ears have been abused to the point of no return. No matter what I do I can't get the audio un-muffled on the Final Act. Dolby Digital my butt. Seriously, save your money up and get the official dvds or blu-rays. Still need to watch the movies. I'll give an update later.",1358121600,4,714,4.136690647482014
