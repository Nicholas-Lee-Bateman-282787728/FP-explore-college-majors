8355655,2,B00284BV8G,"I saw this movie years ago on tape-  a rental from a club I may have paid to belong to, and a period when watching just about anything at home was a new and exciting experience.  I saw it under the title, ""Portrait in Red"".  I thought the idea behind the movie was interesting, but that the actuation was lacking something, or perhaps the content had been edited.  Apparently not so.

Marginal acting, marginal production values, marginal execution.",1394582400,,449,4.705128205128205
8355656,3,B00284BV8G,"Not a bad B-Movie thriller, but it clearly needed more actual suspense by the female killer (Lisa Comshaw). I would have liked to see more Cynthia Rothrock in this as well, but overall not a bad movie.",1233532800,4,201,4.45945945945946
