2886557,3,B000SIWH0K,"While still a good show, the writing was noticeably weaker with the loss of the primary writers that created seasons 1-4.  Thus, much of the humor fails miserably and you can clearly see why it led to cancellation of what previously was a strong ensemble comedy.  The lower quality is even reflected in the set, the only season without show summaries to select on the disc and no commentaries or extras.  (Unless you count selling other shows as an extra--I don't.)  I got the set on an Amazon half price sale and it is worth that price to complete the set, but don't pay full price.",1261526400,2,583,4.471698113207547
2886558,3,B000SIWH0K,"and it was the last episode because they fast fowarded her pregnancy. I wish the writers had written the pregnancy into season 3 or 4, there could've been some funny one liners between Sean & Claudia. The series finale was disappointing, but I still bought this season (And will buy the other seasons) because ABC Family seems to only rerun it on Saturdays now.",1221782400,,361,4.65625
2886559,3,B000SIWH0K,"I hate having to give this one a mediochre rating.  Grounded For Life (alongside Seinfeld) still stands as my favorite (non Star Trek) TV show of all time.  Unfortunetly, by the time season 5 came around, the shows creators had been called off to write for other shows and did not write this season.  I must admit that it shows and the series suffered for it.  And what ever happened to Henry?  It was like he was wiped out of existance and out of everyones memory in this season.  I think they said his name once in the last episode, and that was all for the whole season.  I figured he'd at least come back in with Walt (who was also pretty much non-existant in the season) in the end of the final episode, but he was no where to be found.  I was disapointed in the DVD.  It seems like the production company just threw it all together to get it out of their hair and onto the shelves as quickly as possible.  The first four seasons had a lot more care put into the DVD production.  I'm not trying to diss the show, as mentioned before I love this show.  I'm just saying that the DVD production was second rate and the writing lost some of its flair.  But for the sake of completing your Grounded For Life collection, I would still recomend picking this up.",1201219200,10,1259,4.239495798319328
2886560,4,B000SIWH0K,This is one of my all time favorite shows for the simple reason of it's hilarious.  My only regret is that it ended after five seasons cuz the network that owned it could have probably milked a few more seasons out of the actors.  The show is also a great depiction of middle class family life that several shows boast of having but fall short of.,1200441600,,347,4.242424242424242
2886561,5,B000SIWH0K,"Ah, the show is freakin hilarious and has been for five seasons. I'm sad it's over.",1193788800,,83,4.25
2886562,5,B000SIWH0K,"Best Buy already has this dvd out...exclusively. This has to be one of the realest middle class family show ever. This is real family working class situations. The actors just fit in with the characters. The best character has to be ""Uncle Eddie"". I think all middle class american families have a ""Uncle Eddie"" somewhere...I know I do. Why the network decided to cut the show beats me. You can relate with this show. Its not your fake bogus shows that nobody lives that way. Even though The Finnerty Family is Irish,it feels like any family can be like The Finnerty.",1188691200,7,567,4.623762376237623
2886563,5,B000SIWH0K,I just bought season 5 from Best Buy today.  It was released today (Tuesday 8/28/07) at Best Buy.  It has 2 discs and has all 13 episodes.  Why is it a pre-order here? Was this something special only for Best Buy?  Does anyone know?,1188259200,,232,4.204545454545454
2886564,5,B000SIWH0K,"This show (by the writers of Roseanne) has been able to defy the trend of so many shows who slowly go down hill after the first few season eg Dawsons Creek. Grounded For Life has only improved with each season. The characters becoming more and more lovable and familar, the storylines funnier and the relationships between the characters deeper.

It feels like the show gained confidence with each passing season drawing on its full potential in the 28 episode 4th Season - the best season released so far. The Most amazing thing about Grounded For Life is that every episode has something to offer, there are no fillers, the consistency is really a great achievement and a true testament to the writers hardwork and talent.

Donal Logue and Megyn Price are just wonderful actors and its great see them place the lead roles - GREAT CASTING DECISION!

All the actors selected for the cast seem to be just write for the charater in the show they are playing.

This is a Great Show with an even Greater Cast.

I will watch the dvds forever, everytime I watch them they only seem funnier and more uplifting than the time before!

Can't wait for SEASON 5!!!",1188000000,4,1152,4.622549019607843

8205656,4,B000SIWH0K,"I love this series and season 5 is one of the best. The only thing that bothered me was that they never showed Henry's character...at all! He is in all the other seasons, but for whatever reason he did not appear in this one. They continued to mention him like he was there, but he never made an appearance. Very strange.",1391817600,,321,4.278688524590164

8205658,4,B000SIWH0K,This entire series is just hilarious but season 5 isn't my absolute favorite. There are still plenty of lol moments only sans Henry.,1295654400,,132,4.782608695652174
8205659,4,B000SIWH0K,"One of the greatest shows ever - except this is the weakest season released. It may have Henry (the youngest brother/son)on the cover and the spine of the DVD case, but he isn't in any of the episodes/season 5.  The packaging of the DVD is much simpler than previous releases other releases - slim cases, slipcover, double sided covers, ect. This one is just a standard black case, two disc holder, and insert. It's an okay season. I recommend it anyways.",1295308800,,455,4.617283950617284
8205660,5,B000SIWH0K,definitely worth buying in my opinion. whether you've watched it before or not because this show is one of the funniest shows you'll ever watch.,1266364800,,144,4.8
