4134222,4,B003KZ27N0,"I am writing this review to not just comment on the episodes but, to shed a little light on a long argument between fox broadcasting and consumer. I have seen most of these episodes, they are for the most part memorable The parent Rap is my favorite I love the spoof on judge Judy. My second most would have to be when Homer gets his jaws wired shut mainly because it reminds me a little of the first two seasons where they put sap into many episodes. This season will most likely be one of the last I buy, mainly because the show starts to fizzle and the writers try way too hard to be funny. Now that I have taken part in my consumer report on how I feel about the season I would like to throw my 2 cents in about packaging. I know it sucks I completely agree with every person that has complained about it but, I also understand a few things for instance Fox is nothing but a big corporation it's common sense people whatever saves them money on packaging is a plus for them it most likely does not take more than a few bucks to make this junk anyway. If they make it look 3D and can slap a collector's label on it to make a few extra bucks, well then they are doing what big corporate does, No matter how many people whine and cry about how value goes down on their 2 cents worth of plastic there is some big corp. guy that will turn down the little people, and that's another thing the value will most likely never be seen in this lifetime why? you may ask because they are mass produced, stores are flooded with these seasons you will not see value for a long time and I highly doubt anyone would be so anal as to keep their collection in mint that long when they finally do show value. The best thing to do is to suck it up, accept what most likely will not change and enjoy what you pay for after all it is only entertainment I state that in most of my recent views because I notice how people are taking things way too seriously these days. No one should let entertainment control their life.",1281052800,,2001,4.133333333333334
4134223,5,B003KZ27N0,"I was so turned off by the 20th season's bare bones release that I never did buy it (which surprises me). I'm so glad to see season 13 is coming and is back on track. I always enjoy the commentaries very much as well as other extras, but more importantly it just feels like a celebration of The Simpsons.

It's easy for me to rate this package before watching it: the previous 12 season on DVD have all been 5-star in my eyes. Still think you won't enjoy it? Just ask Ralph Wiggum on the front of the box. He'll tell you that's unpossible.",1279152000,13,539,4.1826923076923075
4134224,5,B003KZ27N0,"I have bought every season of the Simpsons, except 20 that is.  I would just like to say 'bout time, my favorite tree house of horror, pierce brosnan 2001 space oddesy spoof is finally getting released. I knew it was in season 13 and then when they decided to release 20 first, I couldn't stand it.  But I will not let my fanboyism of the simpsons cloud my judgment, 13 is still a very good season and I will buy it.  The only thing that will stop me is if this doesn't have audio commentary like season 20.",1278547200,2,507,4.153061224489796
4134225,5,B003KZ27N0,"First off, this rating should really be 4.5 out of 5, but the half star isn't really an option.  Anyway, Season 13 is a long awaited release, as we got Season 20 for the 20th anniversary.  Al Jean took over as show-runner, who is still in that position today, although he is no longer doing this (at this point) with Mike Reiss.  Lots of people say this season (maybe not 13 specifically...say the 12-15 area) is where the quality of the show started to decline.  I am diehard Simpsons fan.  I have seen every episode, many times.  I own every season, and the movie, that is available.  Now, Season 13 is certainly a time of change, but while the show is changing, I don't think that the quality has changed necessarily.  We see more episodes that have two (or sometimes even a third) plot or story.  An ""A"" and a ""B"" story, if you will.  One thing you do see happen often in these latter seasons is that the ""B"" story that is supposed to be the subplot, is more exciting or interesting the main plot.  The Simpsons still today, and in Season 13 do things very well.  They can still entertain better than anything on television.  They are still able to touch your heart in more ways than one.

Below is a list of the episodes with brief tidbits :)

Treehouse of Horror XII--There's a Gypsy story here, a ""smart house"" with Pierce Brosnan, and a Harry Potter spoof this year.

The Parent Rap--A solid episode with Homer and Bart being tethered together until Marge frees them.  The judge then decides Bart only acts out because of Marge and Homer being poor parents.

Homer the Moe--This is one of the gems of this season in my opinion.  Moe returns to bartender school after losing the passion for his work.  He completely renovates his bar leaving Homer and the rest of the regulars feeling out of place, prompting Homer to open a bar in his garage...guests R.E.M.

A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love--This episode is both funny, and fairly emotional.  I always really tend to enjoy episodes that feature heavily on Mr. Burns.  Homer gets a job writing fortune cookie fortunes, one which leads Mr. Burns to love, unfortunately to Snake's (ex)girlfriend.

The Blunder Years--This episode has a few good laughs, but is mediocre overall.  Homer sees a hypnocist and relives a tragedy from his childhood, that for some reason ties into Smithers and Mr. Burns...

She of Little Faith--Bart and Homer destroy the Church with a rocket which prompts Mr. Burns to buy and sponor the rebuilding.  Lisa becomes fed up with this and begins exploring other religions, eventually deciding to be Buddhist.

Brawl in the Family--This is not only the worst episode of the season, but one of the worst of the whole show.  Homer and Ned's Vegas Wives return, and the family gets arrested while having a fight break out while playing a board game...

Sweets and Sour Marge--Here's another magnificent episode.  Homer and the town are trying to get themselves into the Guiness Book of World Records, which they do, but for being the worlds fattest town.  Marge, doing her humane duty, bans sugar in Springfield, causing Homer to start boot-legging the goods into town.

Jaws Wired Shut--Homer accidentally runs into a statue of Drederick Tatum and break his jaw.  Dr. Hibbert puts head and mouth gear on him that completely leaves him unable to talk, or eat essentially.  He becomes a great loving, listening, and compassionate father.  However, Marge is bored when Homer heals and doesn't revert to his old self.

Half-Decent Propsal--Another mediocre episode this season, Artie Ziff, for one weekend, gets Marge to stay with him, for $1 million (if I recall correctly) to pay for home repairs.  Artie recreates the senior prom and forces himself on Marge, and Homer thinks she doesn't want him anymore.

The Bart Wants What It Wants--Bart ends up in a relationship with Rainer Wolfcastle's daughter, Gretta.  He blows her off for a date and they break up, leading her to a sympathy relationship with Milhouse, leading the Simspons to Canada.  Principal Skinner works on coffeehouse/bar stand-up comedy, a la Seinfeld.

The Latest Gun in the West--Bart and Lisa befriend an old TV actor, who was a cowboy.  They arrange for him to have a comeback special on Krusty's show, but turns out Buck is an alcoholic, who ends up shooting Krusty on live TV.

The Old Man and the Key--Grandpa uses Homer's car to woo women but they are only using him for his ability to drive, as he is warned by Homer and Marge.

Tales From the Public Domain--Shows like this I usually don't enjoy, Homer finds a years overdue library book, and reads Simpson style parodies of the Odyssey, Joan of Arc, and Hamlet.

Blame it on Lisa--The pun in the title might be the most humourous part of this episode.  I may be wrong, but didn't Rio de Janerio sue the Simpsons and/or Fox for how the place was portrayed?  Anyway, the family visits this place as Lisa looks for an orphan.

Weekend at Burnsie's--Homer after picking a fight with a murder of crows has his eyes pecked, and Dr. Hibbert prescribes him medical marijuana.  This leads Homer to become Burns' Vice President from always laughing at his jokes while high.  Meanwhile, the town votes on whether or not to ban medical marijuana.

Gump Roast--Another clip show, which is just a roast of Homer.  Kang and Kodos make an appearance, and Maggie saves the day.  The end actually is rather touching.

I am Furious Yellow--After seeing an assembly, Bart creates a comic that stars Homer, which becomes an ultra-popular internet cartoon.  Guest Stan Lee as himself, who harasses the Comic Book Guy.

The Sweetest Apu--A reasonably sentimental episode (eventually) as Homer and Marge discover Apu having an affair with the Squishee lady, until Manjula finds out by watching the Kwik-E-Mart security tapes.

Little Girl in the Big Ten--Lisa befriends some college students, and begins leading a double life while still going to Springfield Elementary, and attending Springfield Community College.  Meanwhile, Bart gets bitten by a chinese mosquito and must live for a week in a bubble.

The Frying Game--Homer buys Marge a coi pond, which neither of them knows, contains a rare ""Screamapillar"" which Homer kills, or so he thinks, and obviously is unable to care for.  Homer and Marge get sentenced to care for an elderly woman, who is murdered, with them as the prime suspects.

Papa's Got a Brand New Badge--Season finales are usually hit or miss, here we have a bullseye.  During a blackout, Homer, Lenny, and Carl become Spring-Shield, a police force, that Mayor Quimby lets replace the police.  All is well, and Homer is even good at this, until Fat Tony steps into play.

In short, I'll be buying this set, along with every other season, as I figure all true fans will.  Take my review for what you will.",1277683200,10,6805,4.755764304013663
4134226,1,B003KZ27N0,"I'd rather not rate this season yet because I haven't seen it and thus can't comment on the episodes. But since I need to in order to leave this review, I'm giving it 1 star, because I predict it will have the new packaging the last few seasons have had. I love the Simpsons and was never able to catch it when its being aired so I'm always excited when a new season is released to dvd.

However, given the way the last few seasons have been packaged, I would recommend the everyone holding off and seeing if they've fixed the packaging issue before spending (wasting)$30 on it. The last few season have been packaged in an accordion style box that makes removing/inserting the disks very difficult and almost always ends up in resulting in a scratch on the disk every time its used. My solution for the last season I bought ( I stopped buying it after season 10) was to store the disks in separate cases, but the amount of room required to do this over and over and over again for me isn't worth it. You can call fox at 310-369-1000 and ask for the Simpsons department and leave your thoughts there on voicemail, if you share my sentiments, but they don't seem to care enough about the fans to bother returning calls or acknowledge the feedback given to them.

I will wait to see the newer reviews left about the packaging and let that determine whether or not I purchase this season. (Sighs), if I don't get it, at least the library will have a copy so I can at least see the episodes once. Also hopefully this one has some special features on it.",1276473600,11,1549,4.356401384083045
4134227,4,B003KZ27N0,"This show is timeless.  I loved season 13 just like I loved all the previous.  Let's be honest, simspons die hard fans will buy it either way.  The only thing I have to complain about is this: the box.  It is horrible.  I bought sons of anarchy on dvd, and it has 4 discs packaged perfectly.  Why don't they use that design?  Oh, that's right, we have to have tons of pretty pictures of our favorite towns people, how could I forget?

Buy this season, it is just as good as the rest of the show.  It has highs and lows like every other season, but it is still good.",1275782400,2,565,4.0636363636363635
4134228,3,B003KZ27N0,"""When did the Simpsons start to lose its steam?"" Such is a timelessly debated question amongst nerds, and the responses couldn't vary more over the years, from assertions that Mike Scully turned the series into a 'cartoon,' that episodes like 'The Principal and the Pauper' nailed closed the coffin of the show, that once Dave Mirkin rolled in, the series began moving away from emotionally centered stories, even the infamous quote 'Worst episode ever,"" came from a blogger scribing his hatred for the episode 'Itchy and Scratchy: The Movie,"" from season 4; but these days most fingers start to point to Al Jean's tenure as showrunner for a clear illustration of the family's fall from demanding adventures that commanded viewing. In 2004, during the series' 15th year, Harry Shearer was infamously outspoken at what he saw was a declining quality within the series over the previous three years. With Season 13, you can judge for yourself, as that is year one of Al Jean's tenure, and would be the first of those declining shows.

Truly the Simpsons has never stopped offering funny adventures for our classic characters, however its tone has surely shifted as time has passed, but as such it has managed to keep itself capable of renewing its palate of comedy and expanding its universe. It has managed to produce great episodes even during this past decade, but in contrast to the consistency within the first ten years, the show has certainly given justification to comparative criticism. Season 13 is filled with humorous offerings and many explore mature and inspired themes like spirituality, medicinal marijuana, reality television executions, and the infamous skewering of Rio. There is a lot to like here. Many episodes are wonderful examples of the series thumping its chest with refined wit and social criticism, and most are creative continuations of various setups that have worked to great effect in the past. Apu gets a nice infidelity tale, Homer takes on the role as the new Moe, Lisa flirts with adulthood, Bart falls in love again, a clip show, and the three act offering 'Tales from the Public Domain,' which is a nice alternaverse collection of re-purposed classics, even Homer and Ned's Vegas wives return.

While the 22 episodes included here are a certain source of mirth and continued adoration for the series, there is certainly more than enough room for reflection on the seasons' illustration of fans' indifference towards the show. The series has, since season 12, began to air the Halloween adventure, a long standing tradition of the holiday, on the first Sunday in November due to Fox's broadcast pre-emption by the World Series. This seemingly inane action has sadly influenced the perception of the show's urgency. Fortunately, season 21 has rectified this error, but nine years too late. Also, many episodes here feel to be the antithesis of the series' usual approach to storytelling, with nearly every episode using a broad setup that feels like traditional sitcom territory. While in said territory, the series was once reliable for reflexive comedy and biting satire, here the comedy seems to be relying on physical humor and passing sarcasm more than usual. Many episodes feel light in laughs, and our characters all seem to engage in scenarios where they learn lessons they've learned before.

While there are signs that things are becoming much more mechanized in the creation of episodes, and that perhaps the days of the show as the forefront for cutting edge animated humor are now behind them, this season still manage to charm. The many voices behind the past genius of the series continue their contribution to this season. John Schwartzwelder credits five episodes to his writing credit, Jon Vitti offers two, Simpsons 'brain' George Meyer even gets in an episode with now former show-runner Mike Scully, and Ian Maxtone-Graham too. But most of the writing is credited to the new staff at the show who have since established themselves as giants in their own right. Dana Gould begins his credit on the show, and has since become perhaps the most visible of Simpsons writers, and one of the greatest comedic contributors to the series. Current regulars Matt Selman, John Frink & Don Payne, Matt Warburton, Carolyne Omine, all contribute episodes that further establish a new tone for the series. What you get here is exactly a reflection of the transitioning writing staff: many episodes have a quality that feels reminiscent to the previous six seasons but are often next to ideas and comedic passages that are distinctly new to the series. That doesn't mean that this dualist approach hurts the series, it merely creates a new atmosphere within the show, one that some may not like, but that others may find perfectly suited to the series.

There is something about these episodes that makes the series feel as though it has entered a new age of sorts. What that may mean in the long term historical context of the series is uncertain. Many would say it is the beginning of the long winter before the Simpsons Movie, while others may say it is the continued illustration of the already declining urgency of the series. Certainly season 13 is a mixed collection of tales, but it is worth owning for any fan of the Simpsons. There is still a renewed energy from having a new voice in charge, and from a new writing staff excited to make its mark. There are great examples of the continued quality the series has been able to exude despite the occasional recycled plotline or brazen trudging out of a guest star. It may not be legendary, but it's better than most shows after 291 episodes.

An Episode Listing:

-""Treehouse of Horror XII"" : Homer is cursed by a gypsy, Pierce Brosnan is a murderous computer, and the kids riff on Harry Potter. Definitely one of the better 'later' treehouse entries.

-""The Parent Rap"": Homer and Bart are tethered together. Marge and Homer are put in the stockades for being bad parents. And Judge Constance Harm makes her first of many appearances. The KBBL Party Penguin!

-""Homer the Moe"": Moe's swanky repurposed bar 'M' turns off his regular customers, so homer opens a bar/hunting club in his garage. R.E.M. guest star. It's a good Homer/Moe adventure.

-""A Hunka Hunka Burns In Love"": In a strange entry in the pantheon of both Mr. Burns and Snake, Mr. Burns falls in love with a cop named Gloria, who later turns out to be the ex-girlriend of Snake. Enter Homer to his aide, to help Burns win the heart of Gloria, armed with an extremely potent aphrodisiac (which leads to a truly hysterical shot of combined horror later on). Gloria has since made several returns as Snake's love.

-""The Blunder Years"": After Homer starts freaking out for no reason, an investigation leads to a truly wonderful flashback homage to Stand by Me with the roles recast as Moe, Lenny, Carl, and Homer.

-""She of Little Faith"": A Christmas episode about Buddhism that takes some nice swipes at the commercialization of Xmas. Plus this episode continues the show's trend of wonderfully sweet Lisa-centric stories.

-""Brawl in the Family"": Homer and Ned's Vegas wives return, Delroy Lindo guest stars as a moderator attempting to wrangle the dysfunction out of the family. ""Another case of Monopoly related violence.""

-""Sweets and Sour Marge"": Homer tries for a world record and the town gets one: World's fattest town. Sugar is banned, Homer becomes a sugar smuggler. Ben Stiller stars as a corporate junk food executive.

-""Jaws Wired Shut"": Homer's jaw is, you guessed it, wired shut. He communicates by chalkboard and becomes a much better father and husband because he learns to listen. Popeye parody included.

-""Half Decent Proposal"": The Return of Artie Ziff, and he's a billionaire (which was aluded to in season 4's the Front). Artie tries to buy off Marge's love, to which leads to a recreated prom night love triangle quite cleverly. Then Homer joins an Oil Rig with Lenny, whose heartbroken over Carl for some reason.

-""The Bart Wants What It Wants"": Bart falls for Rainier Wolfcastle's daughter (voiced by Reese Witherspoon). Bart then find himself in a love triangle with Milhouse. Plus, see Skinner at an open mic night.

-""The Lastest Gun in the West"": Dennis Weaver of Gunsmoke guests as an aging cowboy whom Bart helps to revive his career on the Krusty the Clown Show.

-""The Old Man and the Key"": A Grandpa Simpson episode that revolves around him getting his license to impress a hot new woman at the Old folk's home. A solid episode.

-""Tales From the Public Domain"": An inspired take on three classics: The Odyssey, Joan of Arc, and Hamlet.

-""Blame it On Lisa"": The Rio episode full with rainbow rats and roaming monkey gangs.

-""Weekend at Burnsies"": The Homer as a pothead episode. A classic.

-""Gump Roast"": An uneven clip show, that doesn't stand well on its own, like most of the later clip shows.

-""I am Furious Yellow"": Greetings True Believers! Stan Lee guest stars as an insane version of himself. Bart creates a comic book based on Homer's angry life and becomes a poor successful writer in the process, paid only in worthless stock. One of the best this season.

-""The Sweetest Apu"": Homer catches Apu cheating on Manjula and walks backwards in shock all the way home. Another great one from Schwartzwelder.

-""Little girl in the Big Ten"": Lisa pretends to be in College so she can be challenged and Bart becomes a Bubble Boy.

-""The Frying Game"": Homer is accused of Murder and sent to death row with a 'shocking' revelation.

-""Papa's Got a Brand New Badge"": Homer and his cronies become the law enforcement in town when the police are once again deemed inept to handle crime. A very funny episode with a great ending.

Don't avoid season 13, there's too many bright spots of hilarity.",1275004800,201,9794,4.887281494876431

4134253,4,B003KZ27N0,"SIMPSONS fans can never agree just when the show lost its original magic. Some maintain it was around season ten or eleven, while some grumpers point to as early as season nine. I myself have not been unable to determine the exact moment of shark-jumping, but I can say with some authority it ain't Season 13. While by no means one of the best seasons and containing a fair share of clunkers, it still delivers enough classic satire and laugh-out-loud stupidity to be worth the asking price.

My favorite episodes:

""The Parent Rap"" - The villainous Judge Harm orders Homer and Bart to be shackled to each other as a punishment for Homer's bad parenting. The slap-fight between Homer and Bart is one of the funniest things I've seen on this show in years.

""Homer the Moe"" - Going back to his roots, Moe returns to bartending school, but when he stylizes Moe's Tavern into the Eurotrashy ""M,"" Homer, Lenny and Karl revolt and start their own bar...in Homer's garage. Homer forcing Lisa to cut lemons at 3 AM on a school night was classic Homer parenting.

""A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love"" - Spurred by a fortune cookie written by Homer, Mr. Burns falls for the ex-girlfriend of Springfield's resident felon, Snake.

""She of Little Faith"" - Any episode where Homer manages to burn down a church has got to be worth watching, and the guest appearance by Richard Gere as Lisa's Buddhist teacher is funnier than I expected (""You're lucky I've found enlightenment,"" he snaps at Lenny. ""Or I'd be kicking your ---!"")

""Jaws Wired Shut"" - Whenever Homer returns to college, wackiness ensues. In this case a broken jaw leads him to become a better father and a more attentive husband, the problem being that everyone prefers the old, moronic, lazy, selfish Homer.

""The Lastest Gun in the West"" -- Bart befriends a washed-up old Western star who turns out to be a raging alcoholic. This episode has some terrific one-liners (""Sorry don't suture my colon, son."").

""Blame It On Lisa"" -- The Simpsons go to, and wreak havoc in, Brazil. This episode is worth watching just for the T-shirt Homer wears on the beach: A picture of Uncle Sam devouring the globe with the caption, ""AMERICA - TRY AND STOP US.""

""Weekend and Burnsie's"" -- Homer on medical marijuana. Nuff said. (Except that the sequence where he is attacked by crows at the beginning is freaking hilarious).

""I Am Furious (Yellow)"" - An instant classic. Bart creates a cartoon about Homer called ""Angry Dad"" which briefly becomes an Internet sensation. A great send-up of the dot-com bust of the 90s.

""Little Girl in the Big Ten"" -- Lisa becomes a gymnast and is mistaken by her fellow girls as a college-age student, much to her delight. Unfortunately for her, Milhouse intervenes. This episode has one of the best and most ruthless Ralph Wiggum moments ever, and one of Homer's best manglings of a song lyric: ""I take a whiskey drink! I take a chocolate drink! And when I have to pee, I use the kitchen sink!""

""The Frying Game"" -- Although the ending of this episode is somewhat too ludicrous for a non-""Treehouse of Horror"" story, the opening plot, involving a EPA-protected insect called a ""screamapillar"" which lives on the Simpsons' property, which of course Homer is forced to take care of, is so freaking funny I choked on my Duff.

As I said, this is not the greatest Simpsons you will ever see. A good barometer of where the show was going was the strength of the ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes, and after season ten they were never quite as good, largely because the normal episodes became increasingly outrageous and thus weakened the impact of the Treehouse tales, whose strength was that they were not bound by the rules that governed the other stories. Also, this was the point where stories became more rigidly formulaic, to rely more on gags and one-liners than overall plots, and to depend too heavily on guest starts who very frequently brought nothing to the table. Having said all that, I laughed my butt off at more than half the episodes here and found Homer's stupidity and Bart's mischief to be just as engaging as it was back in the day. When Homer stares at Carmen Elektra's boobs and she indignantly says, ""My face is up here, Homer!"" he replies calmly: ""I've made my choice."" So have I. I'm moving on to Season 14.",1448668800,5,4293,4.677718832891247

4134304,2,B003KZ27N0,"The 13th season of the Simpsons is definitely a deviation from the style of the previous 12. The jokes are dull and hover on the absurd, the plots are rushed and seem ridiculous. There is a general pull away from the life lessons learned as a family in a quirky, crazy town and the episodes focus on just the crazy.

There are a few episodes which are still decent, but they are far and few between.

The quality of the audio and visual is actually ok for a DVD set. There is minimal to no graniness, and the sound is spot on. Every episode comes with commentary, which is the saving grace of this season (and the funniest part). The extras are interesting, deleted scenes etc but beyond commentary nothing to write home about.

As for the box set itself we see, as with 12 and 11, the discs slip into sleeves. The overall effectiveness and longevity of the set is much better compared to the glued plastic cases of previous sets, but I am not a fan. The discs tend to fit way too tightly and do end up getting scratched. However, I do not see myself re-watching this season much, if any, so for season 13 I guess that won't be much of an issue.",1407888000,2,1145,4.267281105990784

My newish Phillips Blu-ray player has no problem with most disks, but the last 5 Simpsons season sets I bought have issues. At least one and in some cases all 4 disks will skip or stutter, locking up mid-episode. When I play them in an old DVD player they work, though with very occasional stutters. This only seems to happen with FOX DVDs and specifically simpsons season. Why is this? I can find no info online. The packaging is horrible, you actually have to grab the dvd to pull it out, smearing fingerprints on the bottom and rubbing them against the cardboard box. Why does fox use this cheap and damaging format? I've actually stopped buying Simpsons dvds because of this, but because I'm a huge fan I still get them as gifts. My season 11 set the discs were actually glued inside the box! Charging 20-40$ for damaged goods is an insult. Fox, fix this issue. Don't be stingy with packaging!",1391472000,,978,4.658959537572255

They are ages 7 and 11 and although I personally would have not
put them in the direction of ""The Simpsons"" in general, their
parents love it, watch it with them; and ban them from watching

their parents are teaching/directing them toward appropriateness,

You have to wait until you see a pair of scissors and then press 'enter' on your DVD remote before it disappears to actually watch them.

4134407,4,B003KZ27N0,"I hesitated writing this review because, while I love The Simpsons, I'm not in love with them anymore. I don't want to be yet another fan wailing into the ether, ""What the hell happened to The Simpsons?"", but yet here I am. Seriously, what happened to this show? It used to be so damn good! Memorable lines, hilarious plots, guest stars that were more than just the flavor of the minute, smart yet stupid humor - it was pretty damn perfect. So perfect that I memorized all the requisite lines and rarely missed an episode. Then Season 12 aired and something changed (some say the decline happened sooner). The feel of the show changed and I stopped watching new episodes around that time. In fact, I haven't sat through an entire new episode in over six years. I chalked it up to me being an old fogey (I did start watching the show when I was in junior high after all), and moved on.

Despite my waning love for The Simpsons, I still remembered to good times we shared so I bought the DVD sets when they were released. I have nearly every season on DVD up to Season 12 (I never really enjoyed season 1 so I never bothered to buy it). After watching the same episodes from Seasons 2-12 repeatedly over the years, I got a little restless and wondered if perhaps I was being too harsh in my judgement of the newer episodes. So I caved and bought Season 13 and 14 a week ago.

Since I haven't watched the show in years, a lot of the episodes from Season 13 are brand new to me. After watching them over the course a few days, I agree with other reviews that this is a pretty average season. There's not one episode that truly stands out. I think some of the stronger episodes in the season are ""The Blunder Years"", ""Jaws Wired Shut"", and ""Half Decent Proposal"". The weaker ones like ""A Hunka Hunka Burns In Love"" just didn't work for me because Mr. Burns isn't a strong enough character to sustain an entire episode (we get it, he's old and weak), ""The Frying Game"" was just irritating and ""Tales From the Public Domain"" reminds me of ""Simpsons Tall Tales"" which was only mildly funny. I actually didn't mind ""Gump Roast"" because Simpsons clip shows are usually pretty good (with the exception of ""Another Simpsons Clip Show""...ugh), and the song ""They'll Never Stop the Simpsons"" was funny (and evidently true).

As for the packaging, that's been covered by many here too. I have nothing of real substance to add except to say that yeah, it is horrendous and annoying. I think whomever designed the packages for the newer seasons is trying too hard to be inventive when they should just stick to the classic, non-scratchy design. I guess we should be thankful that they didn't try to make those silly, plastic head shaped boxes happen again.

So, did I love Season 13? No, but it's The Simpsons and by virtue of it being The Simpsons, it is still enjoyable to a degree. Having said that, it is highly unlikely that I will buy future releases. While $21-22 isn't a huge sum of money, it's going to take a little more than a few decent episodes a season for me to shell out the dough again.",1353024000,2,3086,4.4373897707231045

4134418,3,B003KZ27N0,"And so it begins!

It's no secret that The Simpsons fell into a steep freefall about ten years ago. The erratic quality of the show began about 1999, but there were still many great episodes produced in that time. Season 13 (which aired between 2001/2002) isn't a bad season, as a matter of fact it has mostly brilliant episodes, but the episodes which ARE bad, are among the worst ever, and drag the rest of it down.

Of the 22 episodes featured about 18 get a 4-star rating. A couple get 2 or three stars, and the worst of the bunch...get minus infinity. First of all, the episode 'Gump Roast' is a cheap clip show. I think it's appalling that 13 years into a billion-dollar cash cow they thought it was still acceptable to churn out a half-assed episode filled with recycled animation, mostly of things that weren't funny first time around. The other bad one is 'The Lastest Gun in the West', starring Dennis Weaver as a old-time cowboy. Weaver's heart isn't in it, his voice is completely wrong for the character, and the story of the episode itself is grim and depressing. Really not funny. I can't stress enough how utterly awful these two are. The writers try to cover it up with self-referential, depreciating humor, but it doesn't, and never has, worked. They use this cheap trick time and time again and I wish they'd focus more on making a better show than trying to jokingly cover-up their failings by wearing them on their sleeve.

But, like I said, the remaining 18 are well-written, have smart stories, and loads of great humor. Where else would you learn that Otm Shank is the biggest star in India? It's just a shame that two bad shows reduced the overall rating to 3/5.

The Blu Ray looks great in 1.33:1 1080p, with DTS HD-MA sound. I wish Fox would release all the early seasons on BD, but in order to upgrade the picture they'd have to re-edit every episode digitally from scratch, as the were edited in video-quality before, and would not hold up well in HD. There are loads of extras and 15 minutes of hilarious deleted scenes.",1308700800,5,2050,4.547425474254743

The story-telling is still good with little of the sloppy lazy easy humor you find in so many other animated shows.

4134421,1,B003KZ27N0,"We witnessed The Simpsons losing steam last season (S12); As we enter season 13, it is painfully obvious that the producers have abandoned the tried and true techniques which made the earlier seasons such masterpieces of Hollywood history. Gone is the wit and intelligent humor; Gone is the satire and parody of contemporary American culture; Gone are the memorable quotes and most of all, gone is the laughter. In their place are plot-driven cartoon dramas, reminiscent of your average live-action sit-com, with dull humor which appears to be aimed the lowest common denominator (as if the producers felt that anything witty or intelligent would be far above the heads of their intended audience and offend them).
  Whereas previously, you could watch Simpsons episodes countless times and still laugh and enjoy them and even find things you had missed in the previous 30 viewings, with this new crop of crud, you watch the episode and are bored immediately, and have no desire to ever re-watch them, because once you have seen the story (the drama which has replaced all the jokes) you've seen all that there is to see.
  Perhaps the producers felt that if they had continued on in the footsteps of previous seasons, that they would grow stale; but there was nothing wrong with that formula, as it did not even seem formulaic, as it always managed to generate interest and enjoyment and contained many levels so that the show was appropriate for every demographic group; but in departing from what had made the show so beloved and great, they have made the show one-dimensional and formulaic, and have removed all satire and intelligence, and all the little references to obscure things and the jokes that only a percentage of the audience would ""get"" but which would keep that percentage coming back for more, because this had been the only TV show to offer us such treats.
  In addition to the show itself, the quality of the commentaries has also seriously declined. With the previous seasons, I'd enjoy the commentaries as much as the show itself, and would watch them every time I watched the corresponding episode....but now, it seems the commentaries consist largely of cast and crew members sitting around watching the episodes and laughing at them (at what, I don't know) and occasionally making a semi-relevant comment or observation.
  The packaging, as with the previous season, is abhorrent and ridiculous, and seems to suggest that this DVD set is a disposable item. I formerly felt no shame in admitting that I- a 48 year-old man- was a fan of a cartoon.....but I would never want to admit to watching this stale witless garbage which is season 13. Not that I was expecting too much with S13, as I had heard that the quality decreased markedly- but as one who does not watch TV, purchasing these DVDs was the only way I could view previously unseen episodes. I had looked forward to seeing these virgin (to me) episodes which I'd never before seen, but as I quickly came to observe: The magic is gone and we are left with just another bland empty sitcom. Somewhere before this season, The Simpsons jumped the shark. The show has become as bad as the cheap packaging in which it now comes. :(",1298764800,10,3208,4.809437386569873

Season 13 has similar packaging but not as bad as 11. Season 11 has skinnier slots so I have to cram the disks in and it's a chore to fish them out. I would love for them to bring back the jewel cases and more sturdy boxes, but I will continue to collect the seasons I love.

As for the show itself, I refuse to watch new episodes ever since I saw Homer strangeling Bart while blowing fire in his face shouting, ""Burn Barty burn!"" I can't say for sure what episode or season this was, but it aired in 2010. I thought that was so tastless and low for the show I have watched and adored most of my life.

2. Can the commentators please be aware that not everyone listening to the commentaries is an American. Quite a lot of the guests are national celebs unknown in the rest of the world, and it'd be helpful to have them explained. Ditto some of the more arcane cultural references.

3. Can the commentators please stop plugging John Swartzwelder's novels and recommending we all go on Amazon and buy them. I've made this mistake and don't need reminding of it.

4. Why does each episode have to have 6 producers, 6 executive producers, 6 consultant producers, 6 co-producers and on and on? This was mentioned on a commentary in this box, but not explained.

4134449,3,B003KZ27N0,"Ever since season 9 there have been complaints from the fans about what they see as a decline in quality of The Simpsons. I'm sorry but I have to agree, I love the earlier Simpsons episodes and seasons but that doesn't mean the latter ones don't have any value. Actually I still find enjoyment in watching the show even today but you can't just ignore that the show is not as good as it once was, and that' being objective. I loved the first 9 seasons, 10-12 are still good to me, season 13 less so but is still watchable.  Season 13 definitely has some good moments and provides laughs. As it turns out, I enjoy those episodes much more now than I did when they initially aired. The thing is, after so many seasons it gets incredibly hard for a television show to stay fresh and keep all viewers happy, season 13 struggles with this. I like season 13, I do not LOVE it like I did earlier season but that's normal, I'm just glad it's still watchable and entertaining. There's no real problem, a show changes and sometimes it's not as good as it once was. No one is forcing you those buy anything as far as I'm concerned.

Some episodes I particularly enjoyed from season 13 were ""A Honka Honka Burns In Love"" which had Mr. Burns falling in love, the three story episode ""Tales From The Public Domain"" was particularly a good and clever one in my opinion, and ""I Am Furious Yellow"" in which Bart makes a comic based on Homer called ""Angry Dad"" and gets successful. I thought this season's Halloween episode was average, the Harry Potter story was a great one thought. Interesting to note, this season brought back Homer and Ned's Las Vegas wives and Marge's admirer Artie Ziff, also from this season on the Halloween shows would not be shown in October but rather in early November. I don't hate any episodes in season 13, for a letter season there's plenty of good in it, I'm just being objective an expressing my feelings towards this season (please don't see this as bashing!). If seasons of the show are still being released on DVD there must be fans who want them right?

Now an issue I feel is important to address; the packaging. The first season of The Simpsons was first released on DVD in 2001, since then they've kept coming and now, in 2010 season 13 was recently released. The history of the packaging seems to interest many here but the reality is that it is not all about packaging, there's the content as well. Season 6 introduced the ""limited edition"" character set, there is also the regular edition of season 13, this year it's Ralph that's on the cover (One has to wonder who's next? Bumblebee man or Kent Brockman perhaps?). Season 11 introduced bad packaging; season 12 continued this trend but season 13 aims towards perfecting the art of bad packaging.

 At this point if you're obviously going to have an opinion about the quality of the show, good or not. There are good episodes in this season and the show is still worth watching if you're a fan. If you can live with the fact that it's not as good as some of the previous season, and the packaging that comes with it, I bet you'll find plenty to like from season 13. 3/5.",1288137600,15,3149,4.460069444444445

4134467,2,B003KZ27N0,"Season 13 of the Simpsons is a decent one, offering many funny and laugh out loud moments. You can, however, see the beginning of the decline in quality as the season progresses. The elements of change are evident, as more pop culture celebrities become the norm, and Homer becomes more mean spirited and less oaf-ish. That said, the worst part of the season is the packaging itself. It's almost like they see the complaints and purposely make them worse. So, last time, when we complained about the terrible packaging that is Season 12, they release Season 20 with even worse packaging. When we complained about Season 20, they release Season 13 with the same packaging. It's almost like they're going out of their way to make things worse. I mean, why add a closed flap when you can save money by not having it? I'd almost swear it was vindictive. If not, then they have no clue what people are saying about the packaging, and they'll continue in the future so we might as well get used to it.

So, the show gets 4 stars for content, and I take away 2 for packaging, as if they'll actually listen.",1283212800,5,1099,4.522613065326633
4134468,4,B003KZ27N0,"I pre-ordered my set from Best Buy and was forced to get the 'limited edition' version, even though I didn't want it (I couldn't trade it out as there were no other sets yet out on the shelves). But I was happy to discover you can peel the Ralph face cover off, allowing the set to fit in my shelf nicely. Still though, I hate the packaging because the outer box is much cheaper and flimsier than in earlier years. And ONCE AGAIN, those idiots put the discs in the disc-destroying and hard-to-remove cardboard sleeves! ARG! It's so frustrating that they continue to package them this way. I wish they'd go back to how they were packaged in the early seasons where the discs were easy to remove and the construction was of good quality. OK, enough ranting, but it needs to be said in the hopes that FOX will quit this crap.

On to the shows...
By the time this season aired, I had lost a lot of interest in the series and only caught a few episodes. So I've actually not seen a number of these shows. And it's been a great surprise to enjoy them much more than I expected. I'm talking laughing hard at jokes like you would during the golden era. I've only watched the first eight episodes or so at the time of this review, but my favorite ep so far is ""Sweets and Sour Marge."" The quality of the shows is great and the set appears to be up to par with previous ones in regards to deleted scenes, commentaries, Easter eggs, etc.

In short, the packaging is infuriatingly bad AGAIN. But the discs are worth the money.",1283212800,6,1514,4.3087719298245615
4134469,4,B003KZ27N0,"Being that season 13 was about the time I started to lose interest in new episodes of The Simpsons, I was looking forward to this release, but with some reservations. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the episodes are not nearly as bad as I remember them being, and in some (most) cases are actually pretty good. Yes, the plotlines are generally ridiculous, and the episode flow is terrible, but there are still some very funny moments and lines throughout the season.

Maybe over the past ten years or so, I've come to accept that we can't have Season 6-8 over and over again. Maybe my sense of humor has changed. Whatever it is, this season was definitely worth the purchase for me.

Of course, there's the recurring issue with the poor packaging that has to be mentioned in every review. I thought the packaging for Season 12 was a step up from Season 11 (at least the discs didn't scratch in the casing), but Season 13 is far below both of them. They've reused the disc storage idea from 12, but for some reason put the discs in a flimsy box that has to be opened, instead of just sliding out. All of the boxes at Best Buy were already damaged. I also opened the case to find that the booklet for this season was bent and folded, damaged beyond belief for a new product. I see from other reviews that this was not unique to my set. Disappointing.",1283126400,9,1356,4.398406374501992
4134470,4,B003KZ27N0,"Well, here we are now with the release of the 13th season of The Simpson's.
This was the beginning of bad trends in the show & Fox.
1.  The shows were NOT as funny as before, showing its age trying anything as a reason for a show
2.  The years Treehouse of Horror aired AFTER Halloween due to starting the season late.  Baseball.  How many years did it take Fox to figure out what a mistake this was BUT they still now show, Treehouse AFTER Halloween.

For the 2cd year in a row due to the chain store I purchased this from I was FORCED to purchase the collectors edition.  I do NOT like these for myself, I just want the normal regular DVD package.

Standard normal extras on this season.

Even though the show was not as funny as it once was when you have an episode with Yoda & briefly Tinker Bell it can not be all bad.

The DVD's are hard to remove from the package.  The booklet with episode list CAME FOLDED INSIDE.  Gee, thanks Fox for that.  High priced & damaged.

IF you are a true Simpson's fan buy the season.",1283040000,,1022,4.153061224489796
