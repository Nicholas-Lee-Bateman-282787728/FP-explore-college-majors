8450264,2,B004ZMBKQ2,The problem I have with this disc is that it doesn't want to play on 3 of 4 players that I own. I don't have any idea why it is so finicky. I will not buy any more from this company.,1405900800,,182,3.4634146341463414

8450267,2,B004ZMBKQ2,"Its a compilation of basic coreographies. May be my mistake, but I did not like it a bit at all",1355356800,,95,3.8
8450268,3,B004ZMBKQ2,This DVD is three hours long. Lots of music all from the T-Series brand. But almost all of the videos feel like a commercial for the movie instead of dance numbers from the movies.  There are four songs on here from one movie that uses all the same movie clips. This gets real boring real quick.,1324771200,3,295,4.267857142857143
