7909461,5,B00000I1WB,"Hey, kiddies; you're back! This hardcore installment is fun, but not as sickening as the first! The racing footage takes up a good chunk of the tape, but I find it provides a much needed diversion/ dichotomy! Great slammin' soundtrack!",1426118400,,235,4.9
7909462,3,B00000I1WB,"This movie, in the interest of being ""fair and balanced"", presents a female-to-male sex change operation.  It also has some grisly scenes of carnage from around the world.  It made me feel grateful to be sitting in the quiet comfort of my living room, seeing things that I hope never to experience in real life.  This is really strong stuff.",1169164800,2,341,4.65
7909463,4,B00000I1WB,"i liked the traces of death 2 it was all real footage and that's what i like, faces of death is just all bull crap 5 stars for traces of death just from 1 or 2 scenes,  very shocking and all real.the only stupid thing is that dumb ass music.",1066694400,,241,3.82
7909464,4,B00000I1WB,"this film is great in a group setting. grab some chips, a few close friends and prepare to be sickened. highlights of this film are a man falling from a 10 story building and bouncing, an africam tribesman getting his penis and hand cut off, a female to male sex change(is that the fakest package u've ever seen or what??) and a man getting his arm ripped from the socket and dragged behinde a jeep until he dies. all of these scene are genuine unlike the faces of death series, but this series lack much of the production quality. it tends to drag at times with footage of plane crashes and nascar disasters, but all in all the most vile of any death film.",1047427200,,657,4.306451612903226
