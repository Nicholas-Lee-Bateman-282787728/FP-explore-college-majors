2831234,3,B000Q6775E,"I was too old for most of these Disney cartoons from the 1980s-1990s.  But I have purchased several for my daughter, like Duck Tales, Tail Spins, ect, and figured this one would be more or less like the others.

It is, in the general format sense.  But I have not been as impressed with this series as the others.  Maybe it is a generational thing, but I am just not as crazy for Darkwing Duck as the other series.  My daughter seems to enjoy them just as much and I have no trouble recommending them, but as a dad who has to sit through them sometimes, I do not plan to buy any more than season 2, which I bought at the same time as season 1.",1199232000,3,643,4.031496062992126
2831235,5,B000Q6775E,Excellent product. Dvd is exactly what it says on the box. Darkwing Duck is just as fun as I remember from my childhood.,1192579200,3,120,4.260869565217392
2831236,5,B000Q6775E,I love this carton and am glad that another dvd set is out with more of this hilarious series.  Get it!!!  Has anyone heard if any more volumes will be coming out in the near future?,1189296000,3,182,4.027777777777778
2831237,5,B000Q6775E,"I'm a college student now, but I still love DW just as much as when I was 9 and it first aired. I used to watch almost the entire Disney Afternoon just waiting for Darkwing Duck to come on!  Now that I'm older, I enjoy another dimension to the show - all the jokes I didn't get when I was younger! Star Wars references, Batman references...and the genius of Jim Cummings never fails to make me laugh. (Especially when he voices 'Negaduck.')

 While we certainly aren't spoiled with any of the DVD packaging, menus, or extras - it's still great to have all the episodes at my fingertips.

 And they'd BETTER release the rest of them!!!  [Including the so-called ""banned"" episode, ""Hot Spells.""]",1187049600,6,693,4.59349593495935
2831238,4,B000Q6775E,"You can't help but love Darkwing Duck--the sarcasm and humor, along with the campy-ness, always made it fun to watch. I'm very glad that Disney has finally decided to listen to the fans and get to releasing these classic cartoons. I bought the first set, and will definitely buy this one. Only problem for me is I think I've seen many of the episodes so much I've burned out on them! But don't let that spoil it for you :)

28. All's Fahrenheit in Love and War
29. Whiffle While You Work
30. Ghoul of My Dreams
31. Adopt-a-Con
32. Toys Czar Us
33. The Secret Origins of Darkwing Duck

2831239,5,B000Q6775E,"Finally! More Darkwing craziness. The cartoon Gods must be smiling.
  The second volume continues to add to the total of episodes  available on pristine releases - If the pilot episode is counted as two we're up to 54 now. (Out of a total of 91.) Those of you with furtive bootleg copies - you Darkwing diehards - can now purchase episodes of your favorite wacky cartoon legitimately.
 Pre-ordering doesn't hurt - you're charged only when the set is shipped.

2831344,4,B000Q6775E,"(Copied from my review of Volume One, as the same applies) The DVD came in perfect condition, it's just these DVDs are very bare-bones. Not the seller's fault, but seriously Disney could have done a way better job with these. It just contains the episodes, no bonus features or anything, and not even creative menus! They didn't even pick nice thumbnails for each episode, and the choice of artwork on the separate DVDs is baffling.

Definitely worth buying as its hard to find these shows these days!

This particular copy is in a pretty nice box too - each DVD (3) is in its own small case with artwork.  Plus, the whole thing seems well constructed.

My ONLY complaint is that this is the last one Disney has released (as far as I know) so we're missing about half of the series!",1462665600,,569,4.380952380952381

The DVD's great except it doesn't display the title on the main menu and not all of the episodes are released on DVD.  Nonetheless, if you miss all these old-school 90's cartoons filled with humor, wit, morals, action, great voice acting from legendary voice actors, and all around great creativity, I definitely recommend this show.  It's worth buying for the fun old times, unforgettable memories, and nostalgia.  I'd relate it to Ducktales, Talespin, Goof Troop, and Batman.",1368576000,,578,5.052631578947368

I've been a major Darkwing Duck fan since the day it first came out on TV, and was always in a hurry to rush home to catch the next thrilling episoded of the series. *lol* I'm glad to see Disney is FINALLY put it out on DVD, but blast it!

I wish they would put it out on DVD in ORDER instead of putting episodes from different seasons out of order on each disk! *pouts* I want to watch them in the order I remember it, and see characters like Liquidator, Negaduck, and the electro guys secret origins, or even the episode where Goslyn goes into the future and meets the now homicidal daddy DarkWARRIOR Duck, who went crazy in the years she was missing while she was away time traveling. *lol*",1328227200,,716,4.296296296296297

EVEN the theme song amazing! I think one of the best theme songs for a children's show ever. I really can't think of a better one:

Daring duck of mystery,
Champion of right,
Swoops out of the shadows,
Darkwing owns the night.
Somewhere some villain schemes,
But his number's up.

(3-2-1) Darkwing Duck (When there's trouble you call DW)
Darkwing Duck (Let's get dangerous)
Darkwing Duck (Darkwing, Darkwing Duck!)

Cloud of smoke and he appears,
Master of surprise.
Who's that cunning mind behind
That shadowy disguise?
Nobody knows for sure,
But bad guys are out of luck.

'Cause here comes (Darkwing Duck)
Look out! (When there's trouble you call DW)
Darkwing Duck (Let's get dangerous)
Darkwing Duck (Better watch out, you bad boys)

This show is as good as it ever was back in the day when I watched it after school. It's one of modern day Disney's best toons & the number of episodes gives a good variety of characters & storylines to enjoy. It's well worth the purchase price.",1293321600,,399,4.194805194805195

I couldn't detect any editing, but I did notice that in ""Time and Punishment,"" the scene in which Gosalyn mistook Darkwarrior's gun for his old gas gun was left in, whereas it was taken out during reruns, back in the day.

As I mentioned in my review for the first volume, don't be discouraged by negative aspects of the DVDs and go ahead and buy them while they're still available.

Let's hope the subsequent volumes will be released soon and with more thought and care than we have seen so far. Otherwise, we will probably all have to get dangerous...",1288656000,,717,4.5859375

I was suprised at how much I can relate to him, even now. But like i said, It's a shame that the episodes are out of order. It's because Disney had seasons 1 and 2 runninng simultaneously on different networks, so they put them on the DVD by air date, not story.",1287792000,,431,4.204819277108434

2831651,5,B000Q6775E,"Darkwing Duck is back with 27 more episodes on three discs.  And he's just as egotistical as ever.

For those unfamiliar, this cartoon follows the misadventures of Darkwing Duck, crime fighter in the city of St. Canard.  There he faces such villains as Quackerjack, a demented toy maker, Megavolt, an eltrocharged duck, Negaduck, a manifestation of his evil side, and the organization F.O.W.L.  And he does it all with his trusty gas gun and the help of his sidekick Launchpad and his daughter Gosalyn.

The episodes in this set contain some real winners.  We get the origin of Liquidator, easily my favorite villain from the series.  Neighbors the Muddlefoots head to a strange town with mutant cabbages.  We get two time travel adventures, one that takes us back to the middle ages and one that takes us to a future ruled by a militant Darkwing.  DW even must face off again death himself after he crashes while not wearing his helmet.

This show is so incredibly fun, and these episodes are no different.  They are filled with mystery and adventure, yet also combine plenty of laughs.  I especially enjoy their pun filled episodes, but their spoofs are just as fun.  I'll admit a couple were slightly creepy.  And the shows are filled with all the cartoon violence you can handle.

As with the first set, the episodes are in original aired order, which means they are in random order.  It's rather hard to follow any storyline as character relationships seem to change at will as a result.  There are also no extras, but the picture and sound are great.

These shows are great whether you want a laugh or a thrill.  If you missed this show when it was on TV, jump on the chance to own the discs now.",1207267200,7,1702,4.613333333333333
