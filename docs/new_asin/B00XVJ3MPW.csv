7201805,4,B00XVJ3MPW,This was good a little bad direction gives it 4 stars...good story,1436054400,,66,4.583333333333333
7201806,4,B00XVJ3MPW,"In the Indian Ocean, a diving bell with a crew opts to make repairs with a storm coming. S@#t happens and it becomes a fight for life among a crew that doesn't always get along. The acting was Goode, but the storyline grew old. I can only take so much drama of people trapped in one place. This is a drama/thriller and not a horror.  Not much more exciting than the cover art.

3 1/2 stars

7201808,3,B00XVJ3MPW,"I thought that PRESSURE was okay, just not particularly original. If you like underwater ""disaster"" flicks, I thought that BLACK SEA with Jude Law was better than this movie. I really like Matthew Goode and I really wanted to ""love"" this movie, but for me, the whole storyline was way too predictable and has been done before in more suspenseful movies.",1434067200,7,353,4.80327868852459
7201829,3,B00XVJ3MPW,Not so good - I bought only because I am a Matthew Goode fan and movie not released in U.S.  It is very sad but acting quite good.,1443484800,,130,3.642857142857143

7201831,3,B00XVJ3MPW,Matthew Goode and Danny Huston were great. Script was a bit weak.  I appreciate the dangers of commercial diving now.,1438214400,,117,4.85
7201832,2,B00XVJ3MPW,Didn't state that it was subtitled so I give only 2 stars.  Only watch subtitles that are prime included.  Otherwise good story.,1437523200,,128,4.7727272727272725

7201834,2,B00XVJ3MPW,"Good underwater camera work won't save the poor script and predictable story line in this cheap straight to DVD underwater disaster movie. Almoust everything that could be said in this genre was already said by James Cameron in Abyss many years ago. I don't understand what exactly this low budget flick tries to tell the audience? Some scenes are ok, the actors play is relatively good, but the movie feels cheap from one scene to another, the script is dull and non captivating. Like they did not have even money to show the sunk ship at all, even as CG. And by the way since they are breathing helium oxygen mixture (they mentioned that in one scene) their voices should be high pitched and since they talk normally it is totally ruin the immersion for me. The movie could be interesting if they explore something else in the story than rather straight survival topics. Well at least movie is actually shot underwater, I remember some cheap movies that did not even do that, just shot the scenes on the dry set and added bubbles via CG.",1437177600,,1039,4.591397849462366

7201837,1,B00XVJ3MPW,"This movie had the potential to be really interesting and full of dramatic tension.  The cinematography was was interesting and well done.  The actors were good actors. I have to assume the director and/or the script was lacking.  I would wait until it comes out on Prime or Netflix, which won't be long.  It began with the feel of The Abyss was that is as far as it got.",1436918400,,371,4.333333333333333
7201838,5,B00XVJ3MPW,"This excellent film is a fine example of why it doesn't take 500 million dollars to make a great movie with suspense and depth (literally!)

Caught nearly 700 feet under water in a small submersible, after their ship is destroyed in a storm, four deep-sea divers fight for survival - when all seems lost. Will everyone make it out alive? Well...you'll have to watch!

A terrific cast, with fine acting, cinematography and a mesmerizing story of staying one step ahead of impending demise!",1436918400,,488,4.867469879518072

8716826,3,B00XVJ3MPW,"Story idea had all the potential for very tense, suspenseful, and riveting movie.  Acting was decent as well.

However, the direction and development were really lacking, and that made for a disappointing result.  Character back stories, which explain a lot and should've added to the drama, weren't explained/developed sufficiently for me to really feel the emotion.  In addition, the tension given the situation and personalities were not executed in a way that left me in any suspense.

quite sad since there was so much more potential for a really good movie.  I can't say I didn't like it, but I probably wouldn't recommend it",1452556800,,631,5.019230769230769

8716828,3,B00XVJ3MPW,Seemed little unrealistic that crew would go so deep without properly prepared gear. Some scenes dragged for a bit too long.,1444262400,,124,4.9523809523809526
