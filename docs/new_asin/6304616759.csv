The ford LTD painted orange is stunning jumping 34 feet over train tracks in rural duarte, c alifornia circa 1987. The outlaw girls in this film are rogue biker chicks gone wild. The scenes in the torture dungeon devised by mr. goser mckay are the most realistic ever seen.  Some of the stars are now gone, but their acting skills in 1987 were highly developed and believable. This is a must see for all car chase fans and kevin callahan fans around the globe.",1341705600,,611,4.554545454545455

His debut is worthy of comparison to classic films such as Terminator, Gladitator, Shakes the Clown and all other blockbuster action films!  With this movie Kevin is destined for greatness.  He is a modern day Clark Gable, with a mix of Russell Crowe.  This movie has changed my life!!!!!
Thank you Kevin, you Rock!",991267200,,372,4.857142857142857
