8520141,5,B0050WBZFW,"The teachings reflected in this book ring true.  No where in these teachings is one asked to have blind faith.  One is asked to use one's intellect to discover the truth about the seen and unseen world.  And then once the truth is discovered to act in harmony with this truth, not ignore it.  How can one argue with this logical and rational path?  Especially when, upon reflection, it becomes clear that such a path is really the only one to a sustainable peace and happiness within. I have tasted many spiritual paths in my hunger for knowledge to guide me the right way.  Although it may sound a bit over the top,I think the true answers lie in the teachings found in this very readable book.  Rick Kaufman",1306281600,,709,4.449612403100775
