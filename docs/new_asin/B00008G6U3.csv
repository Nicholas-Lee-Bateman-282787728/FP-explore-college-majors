1845544,4,B00008G6U3,"After a split between Artmic & Youmex, Youmex proceeded to a sequel on their own, Bubblegum Crash which ran three OVA episodes and is conjectured that it was a shortened version of how Crisis was to end. Artmic promptly sued Youmex, cutting Crash short and tying the entire franchise up in legal issues for the next several years.",1124755200,5,330,4.706896551724138
1845545,5,B00008G6U3,"This movie is the 3rd part in the Mega Tokyo Trilogy (AD Police Files, Bubblegum Crisis, Bubblegum Crash). Since the incident with Largo and the Sexaroids, intelligent boomers have been removed from society to make sure no more of those ""incidents"" happen again. This brings up an interesting question of ethics since some of the boomers in BGC had full AI that placed them on the level (some surpassing) of humans. I found the new hardsuit designs to be rather pleasing along with the new style of music for the series. Overall it was a good series for people who are technologically inclined, along with politically and socially aware of the world from the 1980's to modern day. I reccomend it to people that fall in those catagories.",1115164800,2,736,4.7578125
1845546,3,B00008G6U3,"To straighten out some of the people that reviewed this that clearly don't know what they're talking about - this is the second ""Bubblegum"" series to be produced.

First, there was simply ""Bubblegum Crisis"", then there was ""Bubblegum Crash"" and finally there was ADV Films' ""Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040""

While ADV Films' Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 is arguably the best of the series (simply because it's newer and has the advantage of improved animation technology), the first two series stand up surprisingly well on their own.

Both the original Bubblegum Crisis and Bubblegum Crash series are considered by many today to be ""classics"", including myself.

Bubblegum Crash does take place ""in continuity"" after the original Bubblegum Crisis series, so I'd recommend wathcing that series prior to watching this one for the full effect.  You could certainly watch Crash by itself, though.

Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 is a ""re-visioning"" of the original Bubblegum Crisis series and does not really fit into the same continuity as the original Crisis and Crash.

So, now that I have the continuity covered, I'll say that of the three different series, Bubblegum Crash is the weakest of them all.  It's still a ""classic"" though, that hardcore fans like me will always love.",1108684800,57,1272,5.140776699029126
1845547,1,B00008G6U3,"Bubblegum Crash (1-3) sci-fi/action. Even though it takes place in the same universe as the Bubblegum series,  Crash is a disappointment. The quality in this series is very poor and insults the other BBGC series. The characters didn't act like themselves. Sylia isn't moody anymore, now she's very friendly and has an upbeat attitude. Same goes for Priss,  she was happy and laughs a lot which was not consistent with the other series where she was always dead serious about her job. And the voice actress for priss is different as well, she is not bad but her singing is not as good as the other actress, who made very good sound tracks for the show. Nene isn't cute or bubbly anymore, now she's a bit like a tomboy, I really missed the old Nene character. Not to mention the fact that they all look different too- they are all less attractive looking. In addition to the human characters being different, so are the ""boomers"". The boomers seem dumber with very little intelligence, they all talked like programmed machines and not like advanced A.I.. which didn't make sense in the continuity because if Crash takes place after BBGC 2040, then the boomers should have been smarter and more advanced, but here they seem to have de-evolved back to primitive robots. This also affected the action sequences. The action scenes weren't as intense because the Knight Sabers easily destroyed the dumb enemy boomers. Actually that's just one of my many complaints about Crash.  Lack of intensity! The overall designs and atmosphere of previous series are missing in crash. It no longer has that gritty Bladerunner-like quality.  Now everything is bright and colorful. Also there was: cheap animation with a low framerate, cheap sound fx, subdued sound fx, out of sync dialog with character's lip movement (in both japanese and english dialog), snail pace story, unattractive characters, lousy dubbing in english. They even toned down the blood and gore. The story was boring as heck. A roboticist  created a new kind of robot named, Adama. It  was more intelligent and acted almost human, everybody wants to get Adama for themselves, so the Knight Sabers step in and protect Adama and save the city blah, blah, blah...The story and the overall quality of Crash is much inferior and cannot compare the other series. And watching Crash for the sake of seeing the ending is not really important, because it doesn't have good continuity. Good for teens and adults.

1845604,4,B00008G6U3,"Bubblegum Crisis 2032-2033 was meant to have thirteen episodes but was cut down to eight as the series wasn't a hit in Japan as well as disagreements between the animation studio's Youmex and Artmic. Artmic decided to make the last five episodes but Youmex found out and sued them. Instead only three episodes were made.

The story is about the return of Largo aka Brain J. Mason. The Knight Sabers have broken up as a result of not getting contracts. Largo has hired a mercenary group known as the illegal army to steal parts to control all the boomers on Earth. The Knight Sabers must comeback together and fight their new opponents as well as their old enemy.

The story is hit and miss. The relationship between Leon and Priss is almost nonexistent. In the original series, they were close to having a relationship but in this series they only see each other at the end of the last episode. The other characters: Nene, Linna, and Sylia mostly stay the same. Nene is more confident and mature than in the original series where she was shy and weak. Linna is still greedy and ultimately fails at her job. Sylia continues to upgrade the hard suits and watch over Genom while her brother has moved to Europe.

The animation is great. Mostly 1990's style animation with some updated effects. The music and voice overs is still excellent both in Japanese and English. No extra's on the DVD.

I recommend to watch in the following order: A.D. Police Files, Bubblegum Crisis and Bubblegum Crash.

Bubblegum Crash could have been excellent. The last three episodes should have been given a deeper story. It would have been great to see Leon and Priss finally together but it doesn't happen here. That's up to the viewer and the imagination. However I still recommend Bubblegum Crash to complete the Bubblegum Crisis collection.",1402963200,,1822,4.753164556962025

1845608,5,B00008G6U3,"It's the latter half of the twentieth century, and hi-tech humanoid robots called ""Boomers"" have freed the citizens of MegaTokyo from all types of drudgery.  Unfortunately, cheap Boomers often go haywire, and when they do, the city calls on the Special Felony Crimes Elite Team known as the AD Police.  And when things get too hot for even the AD Police force to handle, they call on the hardsuited ladies of the Knight Sabers: Sylia, Priss, Linna and Nene.  Their story is told in this exciting three-chapter saga...which is entitled `Bubblegum Crash' despite the fact that it has nothing whatsoever to do with bubblegum.  As you probably already know, `Crash' is the sequel to `Crisis' (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crisis-Remastered-Edition/dp/B0002TSZME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crisis: Remastered Edition</a>)...and that didn't involve bubblegum either.

In the first episode, red-eyed Colonel Lando and his `Illegal Army' of power-suited mercenaries rob the Groly Bank of thirty billion dollars' worth of gold bullion after mercilessly cutting down Bogarde the Boomer in a hail of blue machinegun fire.  The AD Police are powerless against the gang's military mobile suits because their stubborn new Chief refuses to approve the use of heavy equipment due to the risk of civilian casualties.  So, officers Leon and Daley hang out at the local diner, where the cute Boomer waitress serves up a mean cup of coffee--literally!  ""Even though they look like human beings,"" Leon complains, ""they've got no more brains that an orangutan!""  Meanwhile, Priss is in the recording studio working on her debut album while very effectively fending off unwanted advances from her amorous, goateed producer.  Linna has given up aerobics for a lucrative position at a securities firm.  And ""little miss cyberpunk,"" Nene, is busy at her computer digging up data on Lando and his power-suit army, and tearfully dreading the possible break-up of the Knight Sabers in the wake of team-leader Sylia's unexplained absence.

Part 2, `Geo Climbers,' centers around the irascible Priss and her unrelenting anti-Boomer sentiments.  ""I hate Boomers and all the jerks that make `em,"" she proclaims.  The motorcycling singer's prejudice is challenged when she looses a game of rock-scissor-paper to Linna and Nene, and is sent into the sewers to rescue Adama, a noble second-generation Boomer falsely accused of a brutal murder at the laboratory where he was assembled.  Although he has no moving mouth parts, Adama possesses a special AI that gives him a conversational ability indistinguishable from that of a human (aside from the metallic echo).  Together, Priss and Adama must battle the fiendish Dr. Yuri's collection of ruthless, heavily-armed combat Boomers on their way to Geo City, while ignoring the MC Hammer video playing on the huge outdoor TV screen.

The trilogy comes to a thrilling conclusion in `Meltdown,' as DJ Tommy, the Max Headroom-inspired newsman, reports on the city's latest Boomer riot.  Construction Boomers are going berserk after having their batteries recharged, yelling, ""All power to the Boomer revolution!"" before smashing everything around them to crumpled bits and tossing massive I beams through car windshields.  Garbage collecting Boomers are throwing dumpsters at terrified citizens, and that cute Boomer waitress is making her coffee meaner than ever!  The AD Police force is swamped with Boomer complaints, and before they can even think about taking action, a trio of angry military combat Boomers has plowed through their headquarters in an enormous truck.  The maniacal malfunctioning machines are headed straight for the armory, intent on blowing the Advanced Police building to smithereens!  ""Knight Sabers, it's showtime!""

`Bubblegum Crash' may not be as great as its predecessor, but it's still great...with appealing animation, a stylish opening montage, slick mecha designs, and lots of ""totally faboo"" music, sung in both Japanese and English.  The `Total Crash Collection' DVD from AnimEigo includes a plethora of full-color and black-and-white paintings and sketches, and comes with an insert that lists the Japanese lyrics to all the songs, along with their English translations.  This anime contains brief nudity (in `Meltdown'), gunplay, and occasional S-word use.

7983481,4,B00008G6U3,"It is just over 30 years since this OVA series began, and it has stood up remarkably well, despite multiple authors, lawsuits between participants, truncated series, reboots, and no definitive ending.  That such a thing is even watchable today is amazing, that most (but not all) of it has appealed to so many different viewers over so many long years is a tribute to the genius (mostly) displayed in creating it.  You won't like all of it, for too many different directions were tried, but you will likely like most of it, and of how many things is that true?

Lets begin with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crisis/dp/B0002TSZME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crisis</a>&nbsp;(1987-1991), a probably intended 13 half-hour-to-hour-long episode series, cut short to just 8.  In 2032 just seven years after Tokyo was hammered by the Second Great Kanto Earthquake, a colossal corporation, Genom, is rising, unchecked by the government entities it corrupts or owns.  Its products are artificial cybernetic lifeforms that are usually in the form of humans, with most of their bodies being machines.  These wondrous inventions do great good for mankind,... when they are working properly.  When they are not working properly, by accident or design, they become a menace to life, and are subject to destruction by the largely overworked and outmatched AD Police and the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of powered exoskeleton equipped mercenaries.  Interestingly, the ultimate goal of the Knight Sabers is not to destroy Genom, against whom most members have a blood debt or two, but rather to control it by destroying only its most destructive projects, products,... and people.

The first three episodes form a loosely contrived trilogy introducing the Knight Sabers, explaining their origin, depicting their struggles, and showing their ultimate triumph over the schemes of Genom executive Brian J. Mason.  This is followed by a single episode savage road duel between an automobile driver and a motorcycle gang, then by a two-episode heartbreaker about love-dolls, apparent vampirism, and Genom corruption.  The last two episodes involve a character with a vendetta (based upon the events of an earlier episode), and a final episode focussing on Nene.

Unfortunately, now the two rights holding companies began to angrily split apart, forcing all sorts of problems.  A truncated 3 OVA episode version of the arguably intended ending of the Bubblegum Crisis series, ""Bubblegum Crash"" (1991), was produced, but it pales somewhat in comparison with the preceding (being a bit too silly), though it is necessary to watch for fans of the original.  An additional truncated 3 OVA prequel series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AD-Police-Files/dp/B0002J4X3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AD Police Files</a>&nbsp;(1990), depicting the origin and earlier adventures of character Leon McNichol, was also produced, but it is overly downbeat and depressing, not to mention inconclusive about the fates of characters other than Leon, especially his first partner.

Next are the reboots, and as near as I can tell, no serious attempt was made to link any of these together.  The first was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crisis-Tokyo-2040/dp/B00TQGGG8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040</a>&nbsp;(1998-1999), a 24 episode TV series plus 2 OVA episodes reboot of Bubblegum Crisis and Bubblegum Crash.  Now, as a rule, I don't think much of reboots for obvious reasons: Wow, the original was brilliant, unique, nothing quite like it!  How can we achieve similar success?  I know, lets COPY it!...  (What can possibly go wrong with that, the world wonders?)  More seriously, the problem with doing this (which I don't recommend by the way; instead Id advise adding sequels to the original story) is how do you do it successfully?  Steer too close to the original, and (unless your animation really is better, which it usually isnt, especially if you are going from OVA to TV) all youve got is a copy.  Whoopee.  Steer too far away, and you risk destroying whatever appeal the original had for its audience.  For this reason IMHO most reboots aren't worth your time, but there are exceptions, and one Im thinking of involves&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Double-Trouble/dp/B00015HUUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Double Trouble</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Final-Force/dp/B0001KNHU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Final Force</a>&nbsp;the 4 episode OVA series and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Decode/dp/B00BLQRFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty: Decode</a>&nbsp;the 25 episode TV series, plus 1 OVA.  At first glance, with the OVA series animated by Madhouse and the TV series NOT animated by Madhouse, it should have been no contest, but the TV series succeeds by being better written.  For one thing the main male character is less of a whiny wuss and more of a thoughtful contrast to Birdys insane recklessness.  In addition a lot more thought was put into the complications of Birdys life and universe, including the whole hilarious Birdy_pretends_to_be_a_model/idol running joke.

Similar things are going on in Bubblegum Crisis, Bubblegum Crash versus Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040.  The biggest problem with the original IMHO is that except for the 3 episode opening and the 3 episode Bubblegum Crash closing, there is no particular structure to the 5 episodes in the middle, and most of the several different creators seem to have focused on Priss, excepting the 8th episode focusing on Nene.  In contrast Sylia is largely a mystery, and Linna is largely a nonentity.  However, in Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 all four of the main characters are more carefully plotted out and, in particular, are a lot more in conflict with each other, both over Sylias secrets from them... and problems with each other.  A number of things brought over from the original series are more carefully planned, explained, and implemented in the reboot; in particular Mackey Stingray has been significantly changed.  Finally, the multi-episode stories have no original series equivalent.  About the only criticism Id make of the reboot is that in contrast to the careful plotting of the beginning and the build up to the end, the final events of the ending seem a bit confused and rushed; however, it is noteworthy that it does make considerably more sense in the Japanese with English subtitles format.

Next, although arguably a prequel, is the 12 episode TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-D-Police-To-Protect-and-Serve/dp/B00005YUN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve</a>&nbsp;(1999); essentially its a cop show about the adventures of a couple of mismatched partners,... REALLY mismatched partners, who just happen to serve in the A.D. Police.  On the one hand it is pretty well written, and, unlike AD Police Files, this series actually has an ending; on the other hand, it is rather poorly animated and has a fairly downbeat and depressing ending, which goes with the downbeat and depressing halfway point.  Now, if you like cop stories, you will probably like this; there is definitely some clever writing about the problems of being a cop at any time, in any situation.  However, the science fiction seems a bit underwritten.

Last is the 3 OVA episode series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parasite-Dolls/dp/B0083QJVJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parasite Dolls</a>&nbsp;(2003), which is arguably another reboot since its connections with A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve (or AD Police Files for that matter) are iffy at best.  Yet Another Serious Look at the Underbelly of Tokyo/Genom City starts out pretty well, if pretty dark and grim, but the individual episode endings don't make much sense, and the final episode is so off the charts insane that it really messes up the series IMHO.

Note: Naked female breasts pop up infrequently but occasionally in many of these shows (in the OVAs) so be ye warned.

7983483,4,B00008G6U3,"Actually the series did quite well in Japan when it originally was released. And that was part of the problem. The voice cast were doing better as idol singers as a result than they were on the paltry offerings of the studio making an anime OVA. The original Bubblegum Crisis was not scuttled by ratings but by legal conflicts (It can be argued that the ratings were not so good as to overcome the legal conflicts.)

Of the 4 series that came out of the property, the original Bubblegum Crisis (sometimes referred to as Bubblegum Crisis 2032) is arguably the best. And that is mainly for its unabashadly 80's stylings that hold up extremely well to this day. And in many ways improves with age. It is as if someone had Michael Mann create a sequel to Blade Runner. The music and deeply detailed environment are what sell it. Plus the awesome Hardsuit designs from Kenichi Sonada.

The 90's remake/re-visioning of the series Bubblegum Crisis 2040 is fondly remembered by many North American fans as it got some air time on cable. It was a much more complete story with much deeper and developed characters. It does suffer a bit from shrieky grungy overbearing 90's music that feels out of place, and the classic ADVision English dub shrieky grungy and overbearing voice acting. Yeah this was dubbed at the same time and by the same people that were producing the patented Shinji Akari Scream. Be warned.

Bubblegum Crash, this series ranks third. But is still quite good. It really was simply designed to complete the last three planned original Bubblegum Crisis episodes. It picks up after the 8th episode of Bubblegum Crisis (2032). It's a great little series harmed mainly by the facts that A. It is little. Only 3 episodes. B. It doesn't really stand alone well. Yes each of the original episodes were essentially stand alone self contained (unlike 2040's deep episodic arc) These are really the last three episodes of the first series. You can't get past that. And finally C. It lacks some of the shear energy of the original. The music just isn't as compelling. The art styling and animation seems a slight downgrade, etc. It's more than sufficient to task. It just suffers a bit in comparison to the original. You will find no equivalent to Konya Wa Hurricane here.

The fourth series was the spinoff AD Police Files essentially set in the same universe as Crisis 2032 and Crash. Meh! It feels like a look alike cyberpunk police procedural that were all too common at the time. It suffered greatly for the lack of the Knight Sabers.",1454025600,,2538,4.70945945945946
