1566263,5,B00005JOEK,It's a real shame that this show was cancelled and the way it happened was pretty bad (getting taken off the air for a few months and then abruptly moved to another day).  Out Of Practice was funnier than any other comedy on television right now but CBS screwed it over.  Thanks a lot you stupid network.,1151971200,20,304,4.315789473684211
1566264,5,B00005JOEK,"""Out of Practice"" will go down in TV history for its truly original scripts and for the exceptional timing of a brilliant cast.",1146441600,14,127,4.565217391304348
1566265,5,B00005JOEK,"You know what they say, ""The show must go on"". I think that saying totally applies here. Out of Practice is like one of the few good sitcoms left out there, and all of the sudden CBS tries to take it away, my day was all good until I looked at the TV guide and saw that OoP had been pulled. Out of Practice has a great mix of characters, my fav. would have to be Dr. Lydia Barnes, and Dr. Regina Barnes, both incredibly funny. I love this show, you would too if you gave it a shot.",1144195200,10,481,3.8686868686868685
1566266,5,B00005JOEK,"In this times where everytime we change the channel on our TV's we get more reality shows than we can really take, it's refreshing to see a show like Out of Practice.  Starred by an amazing Stockard Channing as Dr. Lydia Barnes and Henry Winkler as his ex-husband Dr. Stewart Barnes we have a show that combines the life of a complete Medical Practice family, being as functional as dysfunctional as only they can be. The rest of the family is formed by Ty Burrel as Dr. Oliver Barnes, Christopher Gorham as Dr. Benjamin Barnes and Paula Marshall as Dr. Regina Barnes, who also happens to be a lesbian. To finally complete the story we have Jenniffer Tilly as Crystal, Dr. Stewart's girlfriend. So mix, this great characters, with their own unique personalities, with the gossips and rumors passing by in the hospital they work, their acquaintances, their co-workers and fiends and we get an odd mix to a very funny, refreshing and witty comedy.

I hope this show is made to DVD, but furthermore, that it goes for subsequent seasons because shows like these sometimes go by unnoticed and when they finally get the attention they deserved they get cancelled.",1137110400,18,1157,4.751243781094527
7941742,5,B00005JOEK,"""Out of Practice"" was such a great TV sitcom, with an all-star cast! Amazon, please make this show available for sale on DVD-R, as you have with some of the other canceled sitcoms.  Thank you!",1381536000,,192,4.485714285714286
7941743,5,B00005JOEK,Somebody fell asleep at the wheel when this show was cancelled.  The Thanksgiving episode is an all-time classic.  Please get off your duffs and start doing things correctly!,1308700800,,174,5.178571428571429
7941744,4,B00005JOEK,"Oh I really liked this series. I use to look forward to seeing it and having a good laugh. The cast was wonderful and of course Christopher Gordham is easy on the eyes. Thats always a good thing when you have the combo of being humorous and delicious. Each episode seem to get funnier and funnier. One of my favorites was when guest-star Wendie Malick was on as a friend of the family, particularly Stockard Channings character and she hooked up with Ben ( Christopher's character ). This was way before Cougar Town. They had great chemistry and it was very funny. Each week the show was finding it niche and than it was canceled. CBS should of definitely kept this one cuz I miss it.",1307750400,2,684,4.436507936507937
7941745,5,B00005JOEK,"You have to release this series because it was so! much! fun!! This series was going the way like fraiser, cheers, friends etc... Please, let it go so we can enjoy the entire cast. Thank you.
  Steve fredenburg.
P.S. I am on the list to get this great first and only season so i can enjoy the work and fun that they went through together.",1241049600,3,338,4.184615384615385
7941746,5,B00005JOEK,"I was so disappointed when ""Out of Practice"" was cancelled.  It was one of the funniest shows that I have seen on TV in many years.  The cast was superbly talented and had incredible chemistry.  I am dying to have the DVD of the complete series.  Also, I am praying that somehow this show could be resumed.  I know that Paula Marshall has another show she is on now, but this show was unbelievable.  I cannot understand why the networks keep airing idiotic, brainless shows that are just contributing to the dumbing down of America.  This show was incomparably funny and intelligently written.  I was looking forward to seeing this show on TV for six or seven seasons easily.  Let me finish by saying that I fell in love with the talent of Stockard Channing.  Her lines and the delivery of them were hysterical.  Please bring back this treasure!",1229644800,4,845,4.604026845637584
7941747,5,B00005JOEK,"Please bring this out on DVD soon, and include the shows that never aired.  This was one of the best comedy shows in the past 5 years.",1229558400,4,134,3.962962962962963
7941748,5,B00005JOEK,"I don't understand why shows like Out of Practice and The Class get cancelled. They were great, funny, smart sitcoms, that people want to see. I think many are tired of reality shows. You see it reading reviews that people write. So if so many people want good sitcoms, how do they end up cancelled. I love How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory and Rules of Engagement. If any of those are cancelled, it may finally be the push I need to stop watching CBS. Whoever is running the station, obviously is not in tune with what people want.",1207526400,4,541,4.313725490196078
7941749,5,B00005JOEK,"I am beginning to think that Sumner Redstone (the owner of CBS and Viacom) lost a bet with (FOX's) Rupert Murdoch! How else would you explain cancelling a CBS owned show and leaving on the mediocre at best Fox owned ""How I met your Mother""?

""Out of Practice"" was a witty well-acted gem that if given a chance to find an audience would have garnered a slew of emmys. I'm also mad at the cancellation of ""The Class"". Guys, CSI and it's offspring are not going to be able to hold the fort down forever. You better develop a backbone and nurture these new shows if you want to build a solid foundation for the future. If ""The Big Bang Theory"" gets cancelled I'm going to boycott the network!",1201219200,6,688,4.333333333333333
7941750,5,B00005JOEK,"I am (my family) is disappointed that this series was discarded by CBS. I am a cousin to one of the actors, and will not disclose which one, but regardless thought this series had legs.
The writing was brilliant and the acting was superb by the entire cast.
It was original, current and although not cutting edge, had substance and an undeniably entertaining theme. Family interaction and conflict at it's best.
I am truly sad to see it go. And cannot wait for it to be released on DVD.
In the meantime we have yet another series to review and contemplate. 'Back to You' is going to succeed, mark my words, and both the writing and acting are going to be recognized as universal hits. I would go as far as an Emmy contender! This is after only 2 episodes!
(I hope I'm invited) ciao.",1191196800,4,782,4.4
7941751,5,B00005JOEK,"I have never felt so strongly about a television show as I do about ""Out of Practice."" I'm so angry with CBS for not giving this brillant show a chance that I stopped watching the CBS Network. I sent so many emails to CBS to give the show a fair chance with no avail. From the first show, I was hooked. I couldn't wait to see what was next.  I told CBS that I wouldn't watch their network until they have the show a change and if that meant never watching CBS again so be it. And you know . . . I meant it and I haven't watch CBS since. I wish one of the other networks could show it but I don't know if that is possible.",1152144000,13,621,3.813953488372093
