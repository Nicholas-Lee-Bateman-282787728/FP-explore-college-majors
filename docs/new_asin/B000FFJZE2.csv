8121828,2,B000FFJZE2,"I loved Paul Mooney, he was not on long enough. I thought the DVD would feature him as a central figure, he was only on about 15 min. Save your money, purchase one of Paul Mooney's feature DVDs.",1508716800,,194,4.131578947368421

8121830,4,B000FFJZE2,"Another funny from Paul Mooney and friends.  Not as funny as other collections, but funny non-the-less.  Mooney is comic genius,",1376697600,,128,5.35
8121831,3,B000FFJZE2,"Paul Mooney is O.J. without the knife and the thirst for blondes. Excuse the pun, but he is as cutting edge as they come, and his weapon of choice is a rapier-like wit.
Mooney doesn't mind a little bloodletting, as long as it isn't his, nor that of those who look like him.
Most white people won't get it, but those who listen carefully will. And while this is not some attempt to guilt-trip white America, it will present some uncomfortable truths.
In short, Paul Mooney is  a hero in the 'hood, as well he should be; and he need not be one anywhere else. He is UNIQUELY black--and ours...period.",1272240000,8,597,4.427272727272728
8121832,1,B000FFJZE2,"I bought it just for Paul Mooney, his segment was funny but the rest of the dvd was a waste of time, don't really recommend",1269907200,6,123,3.96
8121833,5,B000FFJZE2,"AWFUL!!! Pointless, Tasteless, Not Funny!!! Got this because I thought Paul Mooney was the central figure....not so! He has a ""brief"" appearance in this mess, but thats it. Waste of money.",1265932800,,188,5.096774193548387
8121834,1,B000FFJZE2,"I'm going to start with saying that I'm one of Master P's biggest fans out there and I have everything he ever put out including cd's,dvd's and so on. This DVD is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and I just can't believe Master P would sell this to his fans because he knows basically only his true fans are buying his stuff these days and for him to even except this movie to be released highly disapoints me! I say this because I know that Master P himself can't sit down and enjoy this movie without wanting to take it out and break it in half, so why should he sell this crap to us? He should be very embaressed. Anyway, the soundtrack is good so at least I have a reason to keep this dvd/cd in my collection! I still got love for Master P, he hooked us up BIG TIME with the Release of Good Side Bade Side because it came with 2 cd's, a music video, AND the full lenght movie ""Decisions"" if you were one of the first people to buy the package like I was, now they sell it as a double disc and the movie ""Decisions"" sold seperetly.",1192320000,3,1045,4.0047846889952154

8121836,1,B000FFJZE2,I USUALLY BUY MOVIES IF IT IS RATED 3 OR MORE STARS BUT THAT'S OUT THE QUESTION FROM NOW ON. I TOOK THIS MOVIE OUT BEFORE IT STARTED PLAYING GOOD. IT IS STUPID AND I'M SORRY I WASTED THE TIME BUYING IT,1170720000,2,201,3.8095238095238093
