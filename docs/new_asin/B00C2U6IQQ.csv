5689311,4,B00C2U6IQQ,"In 1937, Alice Faye was on the cusp of major stardom and ""You Can't have Everything"" is the best of the films which lead the way. The film may seem at first like a programmer, a typical 20th Century Fox musical of the time packed with various acts such as the Ritz Brothers and Tony Martin, but at 100 minutes, this is a beautifully crafted showcase for her, neatly directed by Norman Taurog. The plot is simple. Faye is an intense young playwrite trying to get her script produced. Ameche plays a producer who takes her ""serious"" script and turns it into musical comedy much to her disgust. He recognises her talent and she becomes the leading lady. The outcome is pleasingly predictable.

Along the way, Faye creates warmth with Ameche in their first teaming, strikes obvious sparks with Tony Martin, her soon to be first husband, and spars with Louise Hovick (Gypsy Rose Lee) as her sarcastic rival. The script gave her some range as an actress and she plays her part with a delightfully wry hint of satire and her usual overwhelming personal charm. The songs are plentiful and her renditions of the title song, ""Please Pardon us, We're in Love"" and ""Danger, Love at Work"" are all highlights. Even the Ritz Brothers, contained as they are, are bearable and Harry Ritz meets his match with Hovick.

The film has been released in the Fox Cinema Archives Series which means it is a very expensive bare bones release. At least the print is good.",1388966400,2,1444,4.63671875
5689312,5,B00C2U6IQQ,"Zanuck brought the popular vaudeville & nightclub comedy trio, Al, Harry & Jimmy Ritz, to Fox to spark some of their musicals, usually starring the fine Alice Faye or skater Sonja Henie. You Can't Have Everything actually cast the brothers in roles in this backstage musical, and they deliver the goods along with a solid cast of pros including Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Charles Winninger, Gypsy Rose Lee, Tony Martin and the great, slip & slide dance act: Tip Tap & Toe!
My choice for the best made Ritz Brother films are You Can't Have Everything, So This Is College (with Joan Davis), and The Three Musketeers (a fairly straight retelling of the Dumas' adventure classic with excellent performances by Don Ameche and Binnie Barnes).
Some folks get hung up because they cannot tell the three brothers apart. Harry (the youngest) is invariable placed in the middle of their eccentric song & dance routines and takes the comedy lead. Harry's face is fuller than Al's (the oldest) or Jimmy's who do truly look almost twin-like. Al plays comparatively straight yet Jimmy was nearly as good a comedian as Harry, and Jimmy nose is more hooked than Al's. People are always trying to compare them to the Marx Brothers, whose screen personas were markedly different. That is a useless dead end. Instead, enjoy them for their surrealist approach to comedy, sometimes acting as one manically comic unit and then splitting into three refracted images.

8576803,5,B00C2U6IQQ,"So glad to see the Fox films featuring the zany but very talented Ritz Brothers (who are largely forgotten today unfortunately).  Harry was the perfect centerpiece and in spite of a stock plot line and some rather bad acting by Rose Hovick (Gypsy Rose Lee), the Ritz boys steal the picture.  There is even an early appearance by Louis Prima (who wrote the immortal Sing Sing Sing that was made very famous by Benny Goodman and featured innovative for its time drumming by Gene Krupa). The Ritz Brothers could dance amazingly, do comedy, and in spite of them being forgotten, I am going to attempt to find more of their work on film. It will probably show up on more of these DVD-R archive collections. I think they charge too much for them as a rule because they are just straight transfers and have not been restored but when I have the money, I buy select films.",1422144000,3,864,4.496815286624204

8576805,4,B00C2U6IQQ,"Chalk up Alice Faye as one of them old-timey Hollywood stars that a lot of folks today, when you mention her name, would go ""Whazzat?"" I'll have you know that Alice Faye, during the late 1930s, was a top ten money maker at the box office. She's one of my favorites, with her cool look and her moxie and that rich, warm alto singing voice. You Can't Have Everything, from 20th Century Fox, from 1937, is one of her very best pictures. It's a lively, sunny musical comedy. And while it plays out like your standard backstage musical, man, it's a lot of fun, barring a thing or three. Director Norman Taurog keeps things moving.

Judith Poe Wells (Faye), great-granddaughter of Edgar Allan Poe, had relocated from rustic Hannibal to New York City to make her mark as a serious playwright, except that wide-eyed aspiration gets stomped by harsh reality. The movie opens to Judith, starving dramatist, standing outside a restaurant, eyeing the sumptuous repast within. In desperation, she goes in, she orders, she wolfs down several plates, and she asks the waiter to call the police as she cannot pay for the meal. And because this is a musical, she ends up literally singing for her supper, singing the title song, in fact. Her warm voice captivates a fellow diner, the inebriated George Macrae (Don Ameche). George happens to be this influential playboy Broadway playwright, and it's covertly thanks to him that Judith gets her foot in the door.

Judith scoffs at frivolous musical plays, would rather generate Serious Work, much like Joel McCrae in Sullivan's Travels. But there's George's play in the works, and there's the Broadway diva walking out, and, oh, only if there were someone talented enough to step into her shoes. Get the picture?

I can never take my eyes off Alice Faye when she's onscreen. In other films, she exudes this streak of independence, this tough, savvy exterior, as if you cannot ever put one over on her. But then she reveals moments of vulnerability, and you, dear viewer, sort of melt. In this one, she maintains an unassuming sweetness that persuades you to her side from jump. I love her singing; it's distinctive. She does justice to two other songs: ""Please Pardon us, We're in Love"" and ""Danger, Love at Work,"" in which she shares the nightclub stage with that very cool gent, Louis Prima, and his raucous band.

Don Ameche spends plenty of camera time profiling that mustache and mooning over Faye. In a crucial turning point, he even gets to serenade her. Tony Martin, fantastic voice, has a supporting bit and does a marvelous rendition of ""The Loveliness of You."" My favorite snooty butler, Arthur Treacher, pops in and out. Louise Hovick (a.k.a. burlesque queen Gypsy Rose Lee) makes her screen debut as Ameche's manipulative fiance and sorry I was to be rooting against her (but she stands in the way of Faye's film happiness). ""Those merry madcaps,"" the Ritz Brothers try their durndest to ruin my good mood, but not even their annoying ""Long Underwear"" routine could dampen it. If you're a fan of the Ritz Bros. then you're in for a bit of nirvana as they're folded more comprehensively into story continuity as opposed to other screen appearances in which they're featured only as the specialty attraction - or, as I call those, the GOOD Ritz Brothers movies.",1414454400,3,3303,4.799648506151143
8576806,5,B00C2U6IQQ,Alice Faye is my ideal and her wonderful singing and her wholesome way about her. She is a sweetheart also.,1399593600,2,107,4.4
8576807,5,B00C2U6IQQ,"This 1937 behind-the-scenes musical comedy has all the ""old Hollywood"" elements: Appealing leads, good production numbers, good supporting cast, and a memorable title song (which gets covered several times in different ways). In true classic film tradition, Alice Faye is a down-on-her-luck playwright (her opening scene in the Italian restaurant is very similar to Julie Andrews' ""broke but sated"" meal in ""Victor/Victoria"" decades later. Coincidence?) whose encounter with tipsy but well-to-do play producer Don Ameche (looking natty but still likable) gets off on the wrong foot. Naturally, there's more obstacles in their rocky romance as the story unwinds, including stubborn pride, production problems, and an alleged marriage license (when Ameche was smashed, of course).
The zany Ritz Brothers get second billing in this film, doing some of their best antics along with some amazing precision dancing. The song ""Long Underwear"" is delightfully offbeat, and brother Harry's ""crazy eyeballs"" bit (you'd swear it was CGI when you first see it, but it isn't) is always good for a laugh because it's so startling. Some may find the Ritzes annoying, but I thought them quite funny with uncanny timing.
A slickly done 20th Century Fox production that pretty much gives you everything!",1393286400,3,1285,5.43
8576808,5,B00C2U6IQQ,"This is such a great film. As far as the Ritz Brothers go, you either love or hate them. as for me I Love them.
As for the transfer it's good. Some moderate wear at the head of reels, but mostly clean. This seems to be from 35mm elements. I've seen 16mm prints on this title and those have a hiss on the soundtrack. This print has a clear clean track.
All in all well worth the money. Let's encourage Fox to release more of the Ritz Brothers. ""Straight, Place and Show"" ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" and the official Fox release of ""The Gorilla"".",1393200000,5,540,4.201923076923077
8576809,4,B00C2U6IQQ,"Alice Faye is a favorite of mine. I have many CDs and records of the songs from her films. I've known the songs from this film for a long time but had never seen the film because it doesn't appear on TCM and was never available on VHS. The songs were totally out of context for me until this DVD was released. Finally, many of Alice's earlier films are being released and what treasures they are!

The Ritz Brothers are also in this - they are, in my opinion, an acquired taste however, I think this film is one of their best. The ""Long Underwear"" routine is very funny and Harry is given a chance to do a little extra acting without his brothers.

Don Ameche is as charming and suave as ever. His make-up, however, makes him look rather ""paste-y"" and not to his advantage. I'm so glad that he had a long career and that he had the chance to appear in films well into his senior years. They don't make 'em like Don Ameche any more.

Like all of the DVDs in the Fox Cinema Archives series, the DVD is strictly bare bones: no chapters, no extras, no fancy inserts, no trailers - just the movie.",1389398400,11,1092,4.215311004784689
