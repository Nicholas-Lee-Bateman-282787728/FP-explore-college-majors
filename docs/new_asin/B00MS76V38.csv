6600781,5,B00MS76V38,"This is a difficult documentary to see but I strongly recommend you to see it.  There is so little known here in the states regarding human trafficking.  If you have kids, girl or boy but especially a young girl, take the time to see this.  Not trying to scare anyone but we should be informed.",1376438400,14,294,4.3090909090909095
6600782,5,B00MS76V38,"Unless you have done extensive research into the sex trade, you will learn all sorts of things from this movie that you never imagined could be true. Through interviews with former (and even current) prostitutes and ""johns"" and even pimps, the film bares the devastating ugliness of the sex trade. One of its most valuable contributions is its hammering home--via statements by the prostitutes themselves as well as people who have worked for decades to help former prostitutes--that virtually no prostitutes are in the business because of a free choice. In some cases (e.g., some Las Vegas call girls) there may be choice, but it clearly is not a FREE choice.

It is almost certain that your thinking will be transformed by this film. I highly recommend it for every individual over an age somewhere in the midteens--and I can say that about VERY few films.",1352937600,17,858,4.876712328767123
6600783,5,B00MS76V38,"I wanted to buy this movie after viewing a friend's copy, but it is unavailable on Amazon.  It is a psychologically brutal movie that lets you know exactly what life is like for those caught in the web of prostitution, told in full detail by people who are in a position to know.  Scenes in the life of girls and even pimps are enacted clearly without being salacious or graphic, in between explanatory commentary.  It is appropriate for viewing by mid to older teens.  The various flavors of prostitution are portrayed in places around the world; Eastern Europe, Thailand and the East, Amsterdam, America, and Sweden! (There isn't any in Sweden, because the govt prosecutes the end user....""business is bad in Sweden."")  It is very hard to watch because the tentacles of Prostitution are very firmly entrenched in money, crime, and sexual pleasure, and it can engender a sense of helplessness to know where to begin.  A lot of collusion is happening.  Nefarious is a precise title because this is a wicked, wicked trade.  This movie opened my eyes a lot wider than they were.  If you see it, you will walk away permanently changed.  I think everyone should watch this movie and we should rise up as a nation and do what Sweden did:  End it!  Note: can be bought at [...] for 20$.",1346457600,27,1280,4.64
6600784,5,B00MS76V38,"I was really moved by this film. I saw it at Onething 2011 public screening. That was pretty intense too- seeing in a room with thousands.

As a former porn addict this movie REALLY hit me hard. I watched it with my wife of 4 years (2 of which she stood by me regardless of my addiction). I couldn't believe the industry I supported and thought was ""OK"". I got a BIG revelation that the women you watch on the internet clips actually aren't enjoying what's happening to them. That was a lie that I had believe which perpetuated my actions- I thought they liked it so it was alright. I was totally wrong.

I liked how the film showed the realness without destroying hope of change. It didn't sugarcoat the situation, but was encouraging in the midst of despair. I intended to purchase the copy to help support Exodus Cry and so that I will be able to share the experience with my community.",1346198400,55,889,4.381818181818182

6600792,5,B00MS76V38,"Nefarious is probably the best documentary I have ever seen. I have taught workshops on this subject, so I have had to do considerable research.  I have watched several documentaries about human trafficking and the horrors of the sex trade, but this is the most comprehensive. It's instructive for parents,  educators, law enforcement, clergy, health workers, and men and women who are still deceived into thinking that people in the sex business really want to be there. It also goes into the psychology of victims of human trafficking and forced into sex work. It explains the question many ask, which is:""Why doesn't she just leave?"" By the way, Nefarious 2 is supposed to be released this year, so be on the lookout.",1434672000,2,720,4.89344262295082

6600798,2,B00MS76V38,"The organization is supposed to be Christian but I didn't really see a Christ foundation in the movie.  In fact, if I recall correctly (I watched the movie a few months back) one of the guys almost physically threatens a child molester in the documentary instead of giving him the good news.  If you just want to know what's going on I suppose it's alright but if you want to see the transforming light of Christ in action in the darkness, I wouldn't recommend it.",1420934400,,464,4.447058823529412

6600801,5,B00MS76V38,"This movie helps you to have hope after seeing the most hopeless situations in the world. It opened my eyes to just how big the slavery trade is in current times.  It would be nearly unbelievable if not for the first-hand testimonies.  It can be very disturbing to watch, but it would be more disturbing to me if I remained blind to the issue. I have been recommending this to friends and family to spread the word about the state of human trafficking.",1415059200,,452,4.433734939759036

6600808,5,B00MS76V38,"The first great majority of the movie was the careful documentation of sex trafficking and what that looks like in its distinct different forms over several different countries/sites including America, Europe, and Asia.  This was incredibly well done and the end just wrenched my heart off. perfect 10/10 ending that gets u every time.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!!!!!

6600812,5,B00MS76V38,"Also, Heart-crushing and Soul-rending. This insightful documentary rips away the facade of the Sex Industry to reveal the horror of Sex Trafficking hiding beneath. Unfortunately, the people who need to see this film are not as evidenced by the lack of 1 star reviews. Most johns and willing prostitutes hate these sorts of films and steer clear of them. Looking forward to more from the producers. God bless and if anyone reading this isn't supporting a counter-trafficking org yet, please look one up!

Made a discovery today. Well sort of. What I found is kind of like walking into a room I knew had no lights on and discovering it is dark.

Critics of the counter-trafficking movement don't watch our documentaries.

No. Really. I mean I can't find a single criticism of ""The Day My God Died"" or ""Nefarious: Merchant of Souls"" or ""Not My Life"" from the usual suspects like Maggie McNeill (aka The Honest Courtesan). I did a google search for all three films using key words of as ""misrepresentation"" and ""criticism"". Found nothing after 2 pages so I quit looking.

I think this is very, very telling on the willful ignorance of counter-trafficking critics. I have peered into their literature complaining about how law enforcement and the healthcare industry trample their rights over Prostitution. Yet they won't return the favor it seems. I mean, here is their chance to say: ""see, that girl Gita ... totally brainwashed into saying what she did"" or ""well, sure, it happens in this one hellhole, but that is hardly representative of the rest of the Prostitution world."" Or you think they would have shown up to the commenting forums just to point out how psychologically scarring brothel raids are and how half of those women lined up are probably just poor working girls and not victims and are hiding just so they won't be deported""

Instead ... total silence (well nearly, I actually found one critic from 2007 on a PBS forum for The Day My God Died). Because if they saw then they might have to doubt their rhetoric and realize that NOTHING is worth allowing this evil to continue.

Update 12/8/14 - I finally found a critical review of the film by a Danielle Vermeer
at http://daniellelvermeer.com/blog/nefarious-review. At first blush, I don't see anything unfair in her review. She voiced some of the same thoughts I had on where the film could be improved.",1391731200,,2369,4.837037037037037

6600819,5,B00MS76V38,This video is well made.  I knew of the sex trade; but I had no idea it could be happening in our communities without our being aware of it.  It was very eye opening.
