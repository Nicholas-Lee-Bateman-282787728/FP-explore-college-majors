1973593,2,B00015YVPO,Made for tv movie from the popular books. Movie was a bit cheesy. Overacting is key. Too good of actors for such a bad script. Adam Beach and Wes Studi were poorly casted for such an amature movie. I couldn't possibly dumb down their talent for this case.,1194220800,4,255,4.333333333333333

1973595,4,B00015YVPO,"This is a good movie with Studi and Beach turning in solid performances again in this sequel to ""Skinwalkers"". If you enjoy detective stories, you should find this one entertaining. Fans of the first movie or those that enjoy movies like ""Thunderheart"" should like it. This Amazon price is a good since these Hillerman DVD movies are not easy to find unless you go to [...]. However; there they are overpriced since by the time you pay for shipping and tax you end up spending about $[...].

1973597,1,B00015YVPO,"fell asleep twice trying to get through this movie. I kept hoping it would finally get interesting but it never did.

As reviewer: B. Chandler ""xyzzy"" (Arlington, Texas)said,""Jim Chee sits drinking coffee while partner Tribal Policeman Delbert Nez meets his demise. Chee catches the obvious perpetrator. A Navaho shaman, with a bottle in one hand and THE gun in his belt. Case closed.""

The Tony Hillerman books are good stories - read them and skip these god awful movies.

I should have rented first instead of wasting money buying. There were so many good actors in this movie I thought it would be okay but even they couldn't get past the stinky script writing.

 I also thought Adam Beach was terrible in this movie. Unemotional, sounded like he was unsure of his lines, fresh from his first acting class?

Wes Studi and Graham Greene were great, as usual. Wes wore some pretty spiffy threads in a lot of his scenes so that helped make up for suffering through such an awful film. Although there was a scene where Wes wore sunglasses when no one else was wearing them so it looked awkward. See how boring the movie was? I made it through the movie by napping, checking out their outfits, watching body language, and looking over the sets and scenes.

The blond TA character was also awful. Jeeze, what a friggin sterotype - yet another dumb blond TA doing her professor. EEEch. Then trying to come on to Adam Beach's character. Eyes rolling....

Get a lot of foam bricks if you are determined to watch this awful movie.",1167523200,4,1524,4.66044776119403
1973598,1,B00015YVPO,Typical Hollywood mangling of a good book. Read the book instead. But the book is tougher on the reader than some earlier Hillerman books.,1138579200,5,138,4.791666666666667
1973599,4,B00015YVPO,"""Coyote Waits"", brought to the small screen by the same team that produced the lamentable ""Skinwalkers"", is a satisfying experience for Tony Hillerman fans, for fans of movie mysteries in general, and for folks interested in the portrayal of Native Americans, in this case the Navajo (Dine'). It would appear that the writers listened to the complaints about ""Skinwalkers"" and came up with a story that adheres much more closely to Hillerman's plot and to the author's portrayal of his main characters, particularly Jim Chee (played by Adam Beach) and Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi). Like any novel adapted into a two-hour movie, there are conflations of characters and substantial trimmings in the narrative. Nonetheless, the major plotlines in the book are dealt with here in a generally satisfactory way, although the climax was a bit too pat based on the information that the viewer was given during the course of the investigation into the death of Officer Delbert Nez. The principal character change in the film involves the substitution of Leaphorn's wife Emma(who died in the earlier book) for Professor Borbonnette, a change that is not particularly jarring in this context. Kept intact from the book is the relationship between the traditionalist Chee (studying to be a haatali, or medicine man) and the rationalist Leaphorn (firmly in touch with his own Dine' culture, but deeply skeptical of some of its beliefs). All in all, the treatment accorded to ""Coyote Waits"" bodes well for future productions in the series. Hopefully, ""Thief of Time"" will be next.",1071705600,105,1562,5.129411764705883

1973662,5,B00015YVPO,"This sequel to Skinwalkers is possibly the best in the series. Wes Studi isn't as abrasive (his telling of when his father took him to a bar one night is unforgettable) and Adam Beach plays a more mature cop, with the focus on his sleuthing abilities. Their relationship becomes better. Leaphorn's (Studi) relationship with his wife is extremely well done and makes his character much more likable than he'd be without her, so I'm glad they didn't follow Hillerman's template for this. Though in the books, her loss certainly deepens Leaphorn's character. The movie flows and the atmosphere of mystery is well complemented by the reservation setting. Plus, it's got Butch Cassidy. Who can resist that?",1443139200,,701,5.051724137931035

The film is set across the spectacular southwest and is respectful of the talents, cultures and beliefs of the Peoples who live there.  Wes Studi (Leaphorn) and Adam Beach (Jim Chee) are true to the characters Hillerman created.  Chee's slower, thoughtful path is nicely complimented by Leaphorn's less patient personality. Chee and Leaphorn are joined by Emma Leaphorn, Janet Peet, and a less-than Holy preacher, played by Graham Greene. Mysteries include the murder of a Tribal policeman, the painting of rocks,  an aging shaman, and the hint of Butch Cassiday.  A true Hillerman story.",1394496000,2,694,5.216216216216216

Unfortunately the movie made from the book dropped the ball on this one.  They took the title and used some of the same character names, but then created their own story, almost changing every single relationship, person in the book into more shallow representation. what a disappointment. do not waste your money on this movie, enjoy the book and wait hopefully for someone to do a better representation of the book, which is wonderful.",1391644800,,668,4.741379310344827

1973795,4,B00015YVPO,"I own some Hillerman books, and he's a good read, neither too stodgy in details nor too rapid in action. The movie is, naturally far from the experience of reading a book.

Secondly, I loathe most mysteries, so I won't touch that from an artistic point of view though I'm a writer. I'm not a Hillerman fan, I read him on my mom's insistence that I try - she was right.

This has little of the things I hate about mysteries, so maybe mystery fans won't like it? That is - ghastly old houses, butlers, missing heirlooms, overdressed heroines in fur and diamonds, jealous heirs, and bad weather ... crooked cops, gory emotional scenes of murder ... without which, I suppose, the mystery would not be worth pursuing?

Coyote has - yes, a lot of Navajo culture, yes, some of it gets explained for us White ignoramuses. So? We ARE uneducated about other races, liberal media or not - and there were something like 500 Nations of Amerinds. Even U.S. regional cultures can seem alien, and especially so over 100 years or so ago ... so why would someone criticize Coyote (or Hillerman) for showboating the culture/setting that he builds tales in? Eeek.

The story was interesting. Some of it seemed awkward, as far as forcing the plot and having stereotypical reactions to things, but this could be (is?) the producer's fault? I don't see any cliche or racially stereotyped stuff in the novels. Scenery was lovely at times - and I thought relevant. If you are ignorant of Indian beliefs it could seem excessive ...

But, when Chee or others gather a medicine pouch and stand to face the 4 directions or a span of red rocks - that is like invoking God and facing the altar. Or for a Catholic or Buddhist, facing the holy relics and then going ahead to pray. It fits the characters.

I disliked what felt like a forced ending. I won't spoil it, but I felt the old Indian could have disclosed more of his thinking so we could follow the story better. His actions seemed senselessly obtuse, or alcohol poisoned - then he suddenly gets coherent?

Overall though, I liked the twists and interplay of characters. There wasn't time to make them all deep ones.",1344470400,,2142,4.577023498694517

Jim Chee (Adam Beach) is a Navajo policeman who was giving a girl a ride to work when he got a call from another officer, Delbert Nez, that indicated he needed help, but didn't seem to make any sense. Also, Chee couldn't hear it well enough to know what was going on. Nevertheless, when he finds Nez dead in his burning police car, Chee suffers in two ways: he feels guilty for not getting there sooner, and he burns his hand pretty severely on the handle of the burning car getting Nez's body out.

On his way out of the side road where all this took place, Chee comes upon a drunken old man, Ashie Pinto, and assumes he is responsible for Nez's death. But once Pinto is in jail, and his clan all insist he could not possibly be guilty, Chee and his partner Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi) investigate.

What makes Hillerman's books so wonderful is that he portrays Navajo culture with such profound authenticity. But in this film, Hillerman's Navajo characters were transformed into cardboard cutouts, and the culture that Hillerman so skillfully conveyed was reduced to some flute music and close-ups of elders telling old myths. However, even the stereotyped image of the wrinkled elder in braids recounting the ways of the ancestors looked pretty good compared to the completely lifeless acting. Adam Beach was horribly miscast as the traditionalist Navajo, Jim Chee. He slurred his way through his lines and couldn't even muster one convincing scene. Sheila Tousey, as Emma, sounded like she was reading her lines from a prompter. Wes Studi, as Leaphorn, was marginally better, but he only had one facial expression--hard-boiled cop. (And Jim Chee only had one shirt...) I'm afraid even Graham Greene, that warhorse of Native American films, couldn't save this one.

He can't quite make out what his friend's saying, so he continues taking the young teenage girl to her job.  Later, he finds Delbert shot to death in a burning car.  He injures his hand trying to rescue his friend and blames himself for Delbert's death, reconsidering his decision to be a cop.

Joe Leaphorn (Studi) didn't want to be involved in this case at all.  Ashi Pinto (Jimmy Herman) who is arrested for the murder is kin to his wife, Emma (Sheila Tousey). She's not going to let a kinsman be framed.

This puts Chee and Leaphorn at odds momentarily until they opt to work together.  Wonderful reappearance of Graham Greene as the tribal Christian reverand and taxi-cab driver.  Overall, this is a well done film and worth seeing.

1973828,4,B00015YVPO,"As Hillerman fans we did enjoy the movie and would watch it a again. I did prefer Thief of Time as a story however, but that is Hillermans story not the movies issue. The actors were well chosen for their roles, and personally I just think Adam Beach is dang good looking and just like watching him lol. Anyway, I liked that Leaphorns wife was alive, less depressing than the book where he is always missing her. And in a book you can be in his head, where in a movie it works better to allow conversation with her instead to move his perspective along.

I had a heck of a time finding this to rent, finally found you can rent this movie and Thief of time on Netflicks! Skinwalkers is still more ellusive, and most expensive to purchase on here. I wonder why that is.",1201219200,,767,4.2534246575342465

Because of his guilt at not backing up his partner and at the insistence of Chee's on again and off again relationship with the defending attorney, Janet Pete, Chee must find out for him self what happened and if he may have made a mistake.

Because of a relationship through is dead wife with Ashie Pinto's (the defendant) clan and also being pushed by Dr. Bourbonette (anthropologist), who insists that Ashie is being railroaded, Joe Leaphorn but also investigate from a different angle. He is constantly thinking about what his dead wife Emma would say in the situation.

Both men are pushed into what looks like an endless amount of overlapping mysteries of which the murder of Delbert Nez is just one. They - and we - must deal with the history of the CIA and that of witches.",1503446400,,992,4.6571428571428575

8006970,5,B00015YVPO,Caught this series on Netflix & loved all three of the movies (which I bought here!). They also introduced me to Tony Hillerman & I managed to find all of his Leaphorn & Chee novels which are a great read. The movies follow the books fairly well and the actors well suited for their roles. Wish they would do some more of these movies!,1498867200,3,335,4.25
