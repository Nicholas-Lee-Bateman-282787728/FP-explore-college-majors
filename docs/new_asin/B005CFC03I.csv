4652820,3,B005CFC03I,"This is going to sound weird but Strangers was in one hand interesting and in the other disappointing. It started out as I expected. We follow Eyal first as he arrives in Germany and travels to his ex-girlfriend's house whom he made a pact with years ago. They promised each other they would go to the World Cup together no matter what, even if they broke up. Well keeping his end of the promise, he shows up at her house only for her not to answer his phone calls or answer the door. As he searches for a place to sleep for the night, he meets Rana on the subway. They accidentally switch bags which later results in them meeting back up. This leads to them spending time together, going to the World Cup together, and sharing a place to sleep for the remainder of their stay. Basically they do a lot of talking, drinking, love making, and cigarette smoking (which I am fine with up until later).

Things start getting interesting once Rana receives a mysterious phone call and tells Eyal she has to go back to Paris. As she is about to board the plane, she tells him to not call her, basically to forget about their little affair. I figured maybe she had a husband waiting back at home, or maybe family that would completely freak out at the thought of her being with an Israeli man. Of course Eyal is a total romantic (as shown in the beginning when he keeps his promise to his ex) and decides to fly to Paris to surprise Rana with a visit.

Once in Paris, Eyal gets settled in at a hotel and starts searching for Rana. After getting some info from a cafe that she frequents, he surprises her on the subway. Of course, she tells him he shouldn't have come. He gives her a card from the hotel he is staying at just in case she wants to talk to him.

The twist is *SPOILER ALERT* Rana has a little boy that has serious asthmatic health issues to the point where he must use a machine. One night she wakes up to him having trouble breathing and takes him to the hospital. While filling out paperwork, it is revealed that Rana is staying in Paris illegally and the nurse calls immigration. She has no family in Paris, so the only person she can call to watch over her son while she is locked up is Eyal.

Okay so up until this point I was hooked. Did I think the beginning was a little slow and boring? Yes. But once she left Berlin to go back to Paris and Eyal follows her, things really started to heat up. Being able to see that she is a single mom, struggling to make ends meet and to provide the best kind of care to her little boy who is sick, definitely touched a chord in my heart. And obviously I was curious to see Eyal's reaction to not only finding out that Rana has a child, but that he literally has to take care of him until further notice.

Here is where things go down hill and unrealistic for me. The first thing that confused the heck out of me is when Rana gets released. The people from immigration gave her such a hard time and from what is said in the movie, they had proof that her papers had been expired for awhile. How and why was she released??? It is never mentioned. I have watched movies before dealing with immigration and they never just release you 24 hours later. I guess maybe if there had been some sort of explanation I would have been okay. But what was the point of adding that plot device if they weren't going to further explore it?

The second problem I had with this movie was actually Rana's character. I think by the end of the film I was annoyed with her. Here is why. Once I found out she not only had a child, but one that obviously is very sick and frequently, I started questioning her motherhood skills. She takes off for Berlin at the beginning of the movie and it is never explained why. I mean, did she just decide she wanted a vacation? If so, I think she took one hell of a risk to fly to Berlin and leave her kid with a neighbor/friend, especially being in Paris illegally. I guess once I put that all together, it started bothering me. What mother would just up and leave the country for a few days of booze and a hot love affair? Yes, yes, I know she didn't PLAN on meeting and sleeping with Eyal, but come on!

Okay so here is the biggest thing that annoyed the crap out of me about Rana. Her son is an asthmatic. I mean a serious asthmatic that is on medication and sometimes needs a breathing machine. Why in the hell would she be smoking cigarettes around her kid??? Once she gets out of immigration and she invites Eyal back to her place, all they do is smoke cigarettes in that little tiny apartment while her son is sleeping! WTF!!!!!!!!! It just makes no sense! He JUST got out of the hospital from a SERIOUS asthma attack and she is sitting there smoking away! Okay, I need to calm down! But seriously??? The other thing that further annoyed me was later when you see her and Eyal at a club, drinking and getting drunk. Where is the kid??? When they get back to the apartment you see him laying on the bed I think. What, did they just leave him there while they went out partying?

Yup, that is where I pretty much gave up on the movie. I was appalled at her unmotherly, teenage behavior. It kind of spoiled the ending for me which actually wasn't that bad. I guess I just stopped feeling sympathetic for her. As for Eyal...I think he had a little more common sense but hey, I had to fault him too because he was smoking right up in there with her and went out partying with her instead of staying home with the kid. Overall, Strangers wasn't a bad movie, but the writer(s) of the film should have thought things through a little better if they wanted people to feel more sympathetic towards the main characters.",1321056000,29,5680,4.252777777777778
4652821,3,B005CFC03I,"Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict --I've seen quite a few films now where an Israeli falls in love with a Palestinian and I'm starting to get the sense that, in essence, they're all the same. It's clear from the opening moments how romance between the characters will work out and Strangers does nothing to make me question my notions of these films. It's not a bad movie by any means; the performances are strong and the story makes sense, but there's no drama here because everything they do has been played out by every other film that uses this cross-cultural matchup. Granted, it's rife with political baggage, but it seems like these films are afraid to actually approach the politics. Guy Nattiv and Erez Tadmor, the writer/director combo of Strangers, appear to try to breach those boundaries by using the Israeli attack on Lebanon, but it winds up only being used as a roadblock to their romance instead of the drama it might have had. Eventually, these films all feel like Romeo and Juliet knockoffs played during modern times, pushing aside any actual relevance for the rote progression of a romance film.

Still, Strangers is a decent filmed, well made and solidly acted. Even if there's no question as to how the relationship will work out, the performances from Levo and Azabal are strong. They have good chemistry together and it's easy to root for their success, though there's no suspense in the drama to make you wonder. The story is well-filmed and there are some interesting soccer sequences that try to parallel the political struggles going on outside of Berlin, which the lovers see and deal with together, but none of it ever gels into anything substantial or all that interesting.

Strangers comes to us from Zeitgeist Films in a very standard package. The anamorphic image is nothing spectacular, but is an adequate image with good detail and colors. The sound is a standard stereo mix with nothing to laud, but nothing to complain about, either. The only extra is a trailer.

Strangers is a frustrating film. There's much about it that could have been great, and the setting could have made the politics behind the romance both muted by the distance from the action and more explosive for the same reason. Unfortunately, Nattiv and Tadmor cut the corners on all counts, using the national conflicts to force some personal conflict, but betraying themselves by allowing it to all be okay with a smile. In the end, it's cheap romance that, while competent in all facets, is a film I have a hard time recommending.

4652822,5,B005CFC03I,"That a child back home was asthmatic with a sitter did nothing to deter me from empathizing with the mom's dire need for a bit of time to herself, and that she and her Israeli friend strike it off and become involved seemed totally appropriate given their dire isolation prior to meeting.  If we choose to attach to the rapid rhythm of their love affair and empathize, we have some experience of joy in sharing their love.  It is a movie about passion overcoming mediocrity and prejudice.  It was the beauty of their sensitivity to the possibility of love that rescues them from the garbage bin of history. The Jewish-Arab dimension was treated sensitively and well.  Knowing people on both sides of that unfortunate historical fact lead me to believe the writers really were sensitive to the impossible situation Israelis and Palestinians face.  Unlikely opportunities presented themselves in this story, but the love-shared value overcame all improbability and the plot sounds true and is in no way not plausible to me. The aesthetically perfect gentle ending smashes all the rough edges into a sort of dream stuff. The fragility of love scares us throughout, but surrendering to the ""newness"" they find in one another redeems two lives otherwise set in a dreary mold. Their love for each other grows in unusual circumstances and audience and actors are surprised at ""love's"" power growing rapidly enough to keep apace with the odd fury of their lives.  To me it was a wonderful story of how love can hurry if need be in order to survive in harsh circumstances.  It also brings home over and over that we get few chances at true love.  I took it as a romantic and found it a fabulous romance.  The kid is also a big winner in the deal! Things could have gone wrong at every turn!  It was a wild ride, and lovely.  Childlike joy and rich passion dance.",1313020800,13,1853,4.688271604938271

They ""meet cute"" as in old Hollywood movies, and they fall in love against the backdrop of the Israeli bombing of Lebanon in 2006. The main characters (as well as all others) are dreary cliches, the feeling is Harlequin romance, the acting is amateurish and the cinematography is fake Dogma 95.

4652826,4,B005CFC03I,"I wanted to leave a review for this movie because I think it touched on something very close to my heart.  It is a movie about crossing boundaries and not living your life based on worldly prejudices.  In this movie an Isreali man and Palestinian woman allow themselves to develop a relationship despite the presence of war and hatred that enveloped the two cultures at the time.  It may not be likely that such a couple might have stayed together at that time, but I think the point of the movie is that everyone has a choice to make when it comes to how you choose to view the world.  Are you going to live with the prejudices passed down from generation to generation, or are you going to allow good things into your life that you may not have imagined for yourself?",1298678400,23,769,4.356643356643357

4652845,5,B005CFC03I,"I watch as many Israeli films as I can. When I watched Liron Levo in this film, I was drawn to his acting. Not that in his other films he is the good guy, but he is believable even as a bad guy. In this film he is most romantic, and I can see why Gitai has him act in his films, especially in KIPPUR, where the beginning scene with acrylic paints is amazing.
Back to this film where the Mid East conflict is a component, but not the actual killing and brutality, we have two main actors who would put THE WAY WE WERE to shame.
This actor is amazing and the emotional connection is dynamite.  I don't think he is in KIDON, but I can see that if he were to act with Amos Tamam in a film, the theater audience would watch over and over again. Levon is an Israeli gem. Literally tall dark and handsome and I do hope he doesn't or hasn't let this go to his head. He can be filmed silently in a helicopter in KIPPUR and the muscles in his face, his profile, all say what words do not require. The same in STRANGERS.
GREAT FILM EXPERIENCE FOR ME.",1389571200,,1039,4.019323671497585

Enough it kept this from seeming plausible really.  Plot is too thin, and story is too choppy.  The middle and ending seem very poorly worked out.

4652867,3,B005CFC03I,"The movie was fast paced and interesting at first.  The cross cultural dynamic was definately interesting and handled well.  I thought there might be more to do with the family reaction since it was brought up so early about whether or not her family would accept him.

But truly, the real reason I am writing this review is because it wasn't made that long ago and they have a severly asmathic son laying on the bed while they  light up cigarettes?  SERIOUSLY?  Only ignorant people do that - in any culture or country.  So, I'm just saying that it doesn't matter how adorable the lead actor is or how sympathetic the lead female character is, don't put smoking on the screen.  It totally made me feel like she is a selfish mom who despite her son's asthma, would put him at risk by smoking whenever, whereever.

4652868,3,B005CFC03I,"The film is well-crafted, the actors are very good, and some of it develops feelings with minimal effort.  The presentation, however, is misleading even fraudulent.  The script devalues the political realities around which the players must move presenting equal pathos,representing then two peoples vying for a single land for reasons irrelevant to the film, an ""even steven"" presentation. A casual viewer may even get the impression that the enmity underlying the love affair is ancient and immutable, just human tragedy and unavoidable, ill-fated lovers. Similarly,the film presents death and destruction as equal valued on each side, a convenience in terms of stirring romantic sentiment but a misrepresentation nonetheless.

First, the battle is incommensurate.  Israel controls the ground air and sea and has for a long time. There is no trained mechanized army opposing Israel, no Hezbollah F-16's, tanks or artillery.  Furthermore, the fighting does not take place in Israel but in other states, here in Lebanon.  It is Lebanese society that is destroyed by F-16's, not Hezbollah.  Furthermore, the enmity is only rooted in modern Zionism and not ""cultures.""  Zionism is basically the bizarre belief on the part of some Jews that the Jewish people could move into a land, chase out the inhabitants of hundreds and hundreds of years, take their property, patrimony, rights, and self-determination and live there happily ever after.  This violent displacement of a people from their land is based, if any actual claim is made, on a land deed in a ancient book written by Jews!  For generations, Palestinian Arabs have been oppressed, imprisoned, murdered, tortured, their homes demolished, their children arrested and imprisoned.  For this stupid idea.  Zionism set out to take the land and destroy the people and it has been doing so painstakingly decade after decade with the collusion of the US Zionists. The final annexation of the West Bank, the final destruction of a people will complete the Zionist dream and this is happening right now before the eyes of the world. Palestinians will not be welcomed in Greater Israel and will be rooted out to a thin minority.

Accordingly, the film is simply an error, a fantasy grounded in cinematography and handsome players  and very little of substance.  It is, to be blunt, a work of aesthetic narcissism, plain and simple and can be admired for its ""artiness"" but not for its art. In this sense, it is little more than an exercise.",1375833600,2,2486,5.133995037220844

Hollywood has us spoiled but then again, there is also a lot of crappy movies out of Hollywood, too!",1363564800,,308,4.517857142857143
4652880,5,B005CFC03I,Great o see a movie that tells the true feelings of the heart in times of real need.  Not just half of a story.,1363478400,,111,3.625
4652881,3,B005CFC03I,"It was a very complex movie.  Strangers had to be viewed from several different perspectives.  Relationships at best are very complicated; this movie was over the top.  It started out as boy meets girl, girl and boy fall in love seems simple enough.  After that everything gets more and more complicated. This movie is really worth watching.",1363392000,,341,4.9298245614035086
4652882,3,B005CFC03I,"Parts of the movie confused me! I was wondering how a single mother, with no legal status in France and nobody to financially support her was surviving living in Paris. She was able to travel, to go out with her friends. So not realistic! I do like the love part of the movie, but I wouldn't watch it again.",1362787200,2,307,4.220338983050848
4652883,5,B005CFC03I,"It is only love that will bring a Palestinian and an Israeli to forget their immense differences in all manners and enjoy the moment. So lovee each other and stop hating each other. May be that is the way for the Palestinians and the Jews to solve their differences, mass falling in love. Wish it was that simple.",1361923200,,313,4.413793103448276
4652884,4,B005CFC03I,"A love affair between an Israeli man and Palestinian woman is obviously going to run into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  That fact could have made this a very trite film.  The director and actors, apparently using improvised dialogue, keep this film fresh and original.  The acting is very good.

It is also refreshingly short at about an hour and a half.  I have come to suspect that any movie over 2 hours is the result of poor editing.

While it has nothing to do with the quality of the film I do get tired of all of the smoking that goes on in these foreign films.  Will they ever break with this 1940's Bogartian cliche?",1361577600,,630,4.473684210526316
4652885,5,B005CFC03I,"Guy Nattiv and Ezrez Tadmor explores mutual attraction, lust and love as common ground between two completely opposite strangers who connect by happenstance in Berlin during the World Cup,  He's Israeli, she's Palestinian, what could possibly go wrong? We see the couple fall in love - in classic movie romance style - swept away by lust and the World Cup's incredible energy, only to be interrupted by turmoil at home.  Here, the directors smartly avoid expectations and clich in focusing on our characters emotional and respectful reactions to violence at home, not on politics or history.  Brilliantly, this multi-language film, mixing French, English, German, Hebrew and Arabic, the script isn't heavy on dialogue.  It relies on the wonderful acting and chemistry between Liron Levo and Lubna Azabal to show the nuances of attraction and love between and beyond the multiple languages they speak.",1360713600,6,900,5.2727272727272725

4652888,5,B005CFC03I,"Today is my night off. I was really looking for a good romance movie to go along with my glass of wine. I was skeptical about this movie, seeing how the cover seems more erotic. But I'm glad I watched it. It touched my heart in so many ways. Two people of opposing backgrounds who find a common ground in a unfamiliar place. Since I am a soldier I can relate to that situation. The fact that the woman wasn't Hollywood typical being a single mother struggling with a child made it more realistic. I'm no critic but I give props where props are due. This movie has a beautiful storyline and call me old fashion, but I just love it when the man goes after the girl.",1359676800,10,663,4.1875
4652889,5,B005CFC03I,I wasn't sure what to expect but i found the movie to be great. It definitely kept me interested to see what would happen next. With the background of ongoing war it was fascinating to watch as these 2 people find love. We need more movies like this to show everyones point of view and maybe we could live in a more peaceful world.,1359504000,,331,4.1875
4652890,4,B005CFC03I,"An Israeli, a Palestinian, and an exploration of (im)possible love in the face of ongoing conflict and death between their people.  It's a somewhat simplistic Indie-type film, but the themes and questions posed are not so simplistic.  Worth the time if for no other reason than to just gain some level of a new or broader perspective.",1356825600,,334,4.842105263157895

Very realistic... very much like life.. nothing is ever perfect... neither is love.. I smiled & cried throughout the movie... the end is good as well...

4652893,5,B005CFC03I,"This is a 'must see' film. For anyone with an interest in the seeming intractability of the problem in the Middle East and the inability of politicians to reach any kind of agreement - the story is powerful and hopeful.  A reminder that ordinary people who encounter each other, even in difficult circumstances somehow sweep away the ingrained prejudices and point a way.  Memorable performances by the actors too!",1337904000,3,414,4.9855072463768115
