8654167,5,B00EULXONA,This is a great representation of people with color making a blunt straight to the point /classy movie. A New Mentality is very real and needs to be seen by the masses. Nikki Dacosta gets a two thumbs up for her part in this breath of life we must classify as a movie. Ronald Dillard Jr (director) is on his way. Peace and blessings to you.,1394582400,,340,4.166666666666667
