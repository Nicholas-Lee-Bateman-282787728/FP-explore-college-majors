8157145,2,B00004CP81,"I saw this film in the 1970's, when it was considered a novelty in structure and way of showing things, so in what in Art theory is called ""the form"". Indeed, the author mesmerized us with fuzzy situations, passages read while anothe voice was heard, and so on. But, after all these years, I think it is time to deal with ""the content"".

The film is divided into four parts, each 90'-120'. The first two parts have excellent ideas, as to display the sound of a real Hitler speech about the greatness of Germany, while you can see him working, painstakingly painting a wall. Or to show an actor acting as the Hitler's private servant, telling his everyday life. Or another one representing Hitler's private projectionist, telling his preferences.

But the third and fourth parts are only long monologues about the arguments in favor of the nazis. When you hear these arguments shortly described, or shown as deliberately cynical, it is ok. But when they go on for two or three hours, it is too much, and it is time to start to feel suspicious about the author.

Moreover, in the last part of the fourth film, and shortly after having mentioned the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, a puppet representing Hitler asks the public: ""What have you done with the World after me?"". And near the end a text is displayed in the screen, saying: "" After the journey into this world, who is nearer to God than the guilty?"". I am sorry, but what I passed over being a youngster, is unbearable to me now, and makes the author openly suspicious.",1377043200,3,1525,4.599264705882353

8157147,3,B00004CP81,"Hans Jurgen Sybeberg's 7 hour opus about Hitler came very highly recommended by Susan Sontag, who shed some light on the film's obscurity at the time of its American release.

The film is however, in my (albeit preliminary) judgment, a fundamental abuse of the cinematic form. The filmmaker seeks to reconcile the tarnished history of his country (via releasing a 7 hour prolegomena on the particulars of Hitler's being, which Sybeberg conceives of as the distorted apotheosis of German Romanticism) with the sophistication and apparent brilliance of the heart of European civilization. However, the film is highly pedantic; passages proceed with monologues that recount the microscopic details of Hitler ad nauseum. There are endless discussions of Hitler's clothes, of the films and composers he loved, etc. etc. Not all of it is uninteresting, but this seems to me an exercise in absurdist-intellectual-Brechtianism, and an utter disregard (and lack of faith in), the cinematic form's narrative capacity to disclose truths about a given subject. Sybeberg's grand stage is baroque, creative, and yet at the same time economic, yet it is also clumsy and long-winded.

I suspect that the intellectual community admires this work for the density of its text, and for the filmmaker's audacious, far-reaching sociological register. However, 7 hours of Sybeberg's pontifications fail to convey the philosophical/political horror that was the Holocaust that 30 minutes of Alain Resnais' `Night and Fog' was able to convey with mere photographs and documentary footage. This is an undeniable failing as a filmmaker in my judgment.

Never the less, Sybeberg's film is undoubtedly rich, and everyone should see it. Perhaps I have merely misunderstood his lengthy piece, but I suspect that my initial reaction is correct. See it and judge for yourself.",1151971200,23,1843,5.392361111111111
8157148,5,B00004CP81,"Syberberg's grand, hysterical, haunting, beautiful, and profoundly original attempt to piece together images, ideas, feelings, and concepts about Hitler and the demise of Europe in the 20th century.  A bit OTT, to say the least, but unlike anything else ever put on film.",1136246400,5,271,5.3023255813953485
