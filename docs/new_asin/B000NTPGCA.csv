2781759,5,B000NTPGCA,"Wanted Dead or Alive is one of the best Western shows created during the golden era of TV Westerns in the late 50s and early 60s. In my opinion, Season 2 of Wanted Dead or Alive is the better of than Season 1. I have not seen Season 3 yet so I cannot comment on it. The main reason I prefer Season 2 is due to the change in demeanor and personality of the main character, Josh Randall. In this season, Josh Randall undergoes a major overhaul. In Season 1 he was a pretty normal and straight guy who didn't have much personality. In Season 2, Steve McQueen does a 180 degree turn and makes the Randall character a truly fascinating and somewhat humorous person. His dry sense of humor and perfect delivery of one-liners make the Randall character one of the most memorable and entertaining in TV Westerns history. I suspect this is one of the main reasons why the First Season finished at number 16 in the TV ratings while Season 2 finished at number 9. The plots are extremely well thought out and very suspenseful. If it's possible to put a human face on a bounty hunter, Wanted Dead or Alive does it. Randall's philosophy throughout each episode is basically this: If I bring you in, at least you'll get a fair trial. If someone else finds you, they'll simply kill you and collect the reward money. This makes Randall the bounty hunter seem like a compassionate and caring rescuer in comparison to the other bounty hunters. One strange thing about Season 2 is that near the end of the series, a side kick named Jason is introduced to help Randall track down wanted men. I prefer the show when Randall works alone. Giving screen time to Jason means less screen time for Randall resulting in a decrease of entertainment. Season 2 is well worth the investment. In my opinion, the only western show that surpasses Wanted Dead or Alive in quality is Gunsmoke.",1187827200,8,1856,4.510385756676558
2781760,4,B000NTPGCA,"I just wanted to say im glad season 2 was finally released. I was a big fan and havnt saw the show in a long time. McQueen was at his best in this series,they don't make em like it any more. I thought the quality of the set was great,the only thing i would have like to have seen was some colorized episodes like was in season 1. But over all I was very pleased,hope to see season 3 coming out soon.
  Thanks Leo",1186617600,,412,3.892857142857143
2781761,5,B000NTPGCA,"Apparently someone other than consumers reads these reviews, because the packaging people hated from the first season is gone.  Instead of a light cardboard wrapper around 4 hard plastic DVD holders kept in place by tape, the new season has the 4 DVDs in flexible plastic, ultra-thin boxes.  The DVDs are held securely, but can be easily removed without bending or cracking either the DVD or case.

I'm also happier with single-sided DVDs in this season, instead of the double-sided ones from the first season.  Unfortunately, where the first season had 8 DVD sides to work with and numerous extras, this season had only 4 DVD sides of episodes and almost no extras.  In fact, there seems to be no subtitles or closed captions, although there is audio in both English and French.  While I'm amused by the French language track, I'd prefer subtitles or captions.  I would've been happier with an additional DVD or so to allow for extras.  Then again, there were so many extras on the first set, maybe they used up all they had.

Contrary to what Amazon's description says, this set is B&W, not colorized.  I'm grateful they were wrong.",1185753600,8,1134,4.769230769230769
2781762,4,B000NTPGCA,"Truth to be told, the wait for these episodes would make almost any trouble negligible!! However, it's possible the DVDs I got were somewhat defective.  The last disc would not let me access the second screen of the individual episodes.  I had to resort to playing all the episodes and fast-forwarding through the prior episodes to reach those I hadn't watched.  The access is tricky, if you simply ""page down,"" you end up back at the main menu.  However, if you use the right-hand directional button, you can reach the second screen and the other four episodes.  At least this worked on the first three discs.",1185408000,,610,4.716981132075472
2781763,5,B000NTPGCA,"Steve McQueen personified cool.  He was a natural.  He made acting look so easy and effortless for an actor with such depth and versatility.  I prefer the 2nd season since, as a previous reviewer noted, McQueen's character was more fully developed and one can sense McQueen's comedic side without losing the dramatic aspects of each episode.",1184716800,,341,5.053571428571429
2781764,5,B000NTPGCA,I have seen most of the episodes for season two and Mcqueen is more comfortable in the character of Josh Randall then he was in season one.  In fact some of these episodes are more of a comedy than a drama. In Wanted Dead or Alive Steve Mcqueen shows why he was the top box office star of the 60s and 70s.  I must buy for a Steve Mcqueen fan.,1177804800,23,342,3.8714285714285714

2781766,5,B000NTPGCA,"One of the most memorable and famous characters of the '50's Western genre was Steve McQueen's ""Josh Randall"", who spoke softly (with the Southern drawl he cultivated in his early days roaming around the South, particularly Myrtle Beach, S.C.) and carried a Big Gun, the sawed-off Winchester lever-action rifle then known as the ""Mare's Laig"". I remember the excitement each week eagerly waiting for each episode of this great Western.

It's release on DVD has been just too long a wait!

One of my fondest childhood memories was the weekend I spent with my Dad, helping him to hand make my own custom-made leather belt rig from scratch for my toy ""Mare's Laig"" in time for use as part of a Halloween costume when the plastic original proved to be a poor replica.

With all the second- and third-rate wastage flooding the DVD market lately, it's really great to see SOMEBODY bring back such a great actor in this really great Western!",1175385600,35,934,4.753086419753086

2781852,4,B000NTPGCA,"Film icon Steve McQueen returns as bounty hunter Josh Randall, in the second season of Wanted Dead or Alive.  Things get of to a slow start, as Randall is at first involved more in domestic matters than in corralling outlaws.  The producers may have wanted to emphasize the character's human side, however things soon get back to familiar ground, with Randall also employing a six gun, as well as his trademark mare's leg, in the pursuit of wanted men.  The quality of the writing is mostly good, but does slide bit at times, as Randall finds himself in some clichd situations that he mostly avoided in season one.

Rarely injured in season one, Randall takes a slew of bullets in season two.  Fortunately he's a fast healer.  At the end of `Reckless' (Episode 46), Randall gets shot in his left arm, then in the very next episode (`Desert Seed'), he gets shot again in the precredit opening scene.  He is nicked on the arm in `Pariah' (Episode 63), and then his skull is grazed in `Vendetta' (Episode 64).  In `Jason' (Episode 57) he takes his most serious hit, and is taken out of action.  This episode, introduces the character Jason Nichols (Wright King), a lawman who wants Randall to help him to become a bounty hunter.  The writers finished off Season Two, teaming Josh with Jason Nichols, in nine of the last twelve episodes.  Perhaps giving Randall a partner was a change the writers were contemplating making in season three.  If so, it is fortunate that it did not happen, as Josh Randall operates best alone.  Jason Nichols, while mildly likeable, does not really have particularly good chemistry with Randall.

Some noteworthy episodes include, `Black Belt', where on the trail of a man who is an expert in karate, Randall receives a blow that almost kills him.  An interesting situation arises in `Tolliver Bender', where Randall uses Jason Nichols as collateral, to `borrow' a condemned man so he can testify and save the life of a friend.  In `The Tyrant', Josh helps free a town from the grip of a dictatorial marshal.  Running afoul of the law, Randall ends up working in a gold mine in `Chain Gang'.  `The Monster' is a farfetched tale where an elephant is apparently being used as a tool for robbery.  `Vendetta' is a poorly written adventure, where after Josh has his prisoner taken from him by a deranged army officer.  He is conscripted by the army to relieve that same officer of command.  In `Prison Trail', Josh and Jason face danger while escorting four prisoners to Leavenworth prison.

The thirty two episodes of Season Two are on four single sided discs with eight episodes each.  The episodes now have chapter stops.  No colorized versions this time.  The lone bonus is the short featurette, The Women of Wanted Dead or Alive, which unfortunately doesn't have much substance.  Women are an interesting subject, as Randall doesn't have much time for the ladies.  He has no inclination to settle down, and women often appear just for decorative purposes.  When a female is actively involved in the story, unfortunately for Randall, she often turns out to have bad intentions toward him.  Females who murder are a common occurrence on this program, perhaps serving as a reflection of Randall's ethical code.

If you liked the first season, Season Two delivers much of the same.  The writing, while still creative, shows signs of taking the easy way out, and Josh gets shot up a lot.  Giving Randall a companion was an experiment with mixed results, and he would be back on his own, for the final season of Wanted Dead or Alive.",1243814400,,3555,4.758169934640523
2781853,3,B000NTPGCA,"Bought all three seasons from independent vendors on Amazon. Eight episodes from each season are missing - a total of 24. That's the bad news and it's probably my own fault for buying cheap. The good part is the quality of the picture is sharp and clear. Steve McQueen is brilliant, just as I remember. The stories are well written and the acting is great. There's a lot of action, enought to keep you glued to your seat for 26 minutes.

2781854,5,B000NTPGCA,"As a Steve McQueen fan and remembering WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE from television when I was a kid, I was a little disappointed in Season One. It was a little perfunctory and McQueen was just starting his career. Considering that often the first season of any show can be a little weak until it establishes itself and its characters, I ordered the second Season and was glad I did so. McQueen's character was more developed and had more edge, the stories were more about bounty-hunting than the helpful saddletramp that McQueen was mainly in the first season, and overall the packaging was much better and the disks were one-sided (not double-sided as with the first season). Now I wish someone would bring out the other great Four Star Films, Inc show - RIFLEMAN - in its entirety and in a professionally done package rather than the Chinese version of 23 disks mostly recorded from TV that is available now. I will be buying Season 3 of WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE.",1230595200,3,954,4.617647058823529

2781856,5,B000NTPGCA,"I remember watching these shows on TV as a boy.  They were re-runs back then (1960's).

I was hooked on them from the start.  Steve McQueen's facial expressions were so, well, expressive that you could tell what he was thinking as Josh Randal.

His body language skills would serve him well throughout his acting career.

See how it all started in the Season One DVD's and you'll just have to get this one and Season Three as well!

The DVD's are just like watching the TV show with the commercials removed.  Picture and sound quality are very good.  It is amazing that a 30 minute show when they were originally broadcast ran for something like 25 minutes.  The commercial breaks were very short compared to today.

2781862,5,B000NTPGCA,"Season One was a little barebones, as if Fourstar is testing the water with it's new star. Season Two is more sophisticated and ambitious. It also just gets better as the season progresses. McQueen fully shapes out his character and is beginning to become too big a star for a mere TV screen. However, he certainly displays his generosity as the intriguing and original character of Jason (played by Wright King) is introduced and is a part of the Wanted: Dead or Alive cast for several episodes. King is surprisingly likeable and interesting onscreen, considering he is sharing it with Steve McQueen. Perhaps McQueen was working on Never So Few and somewhat preoccupied, but hats off to him for allowing another character to play on his turf. Normally, I would just be annoyed that the writers would decrease my man McQueen's role for some upstart, but Wright King is really excellent in his character and I found myself looking forward to the next episode that continued the ""Jason"" storyline.

2781865,5,B000NTPGCA,"Steve McQueen's star started to shine with this fun series about an 1800's western bounty hunter.  I became a big fan of his and he never has diminished as the prototype of an upbeat action hero.  He was successful in motion pictures after this series and in my opinion earned his stripes in ""The Great Escape"", ""The Magnificent Seven"" and Bullett with his rugged portrayals of a ""different"" but very admirable and upbeat hero.",1189296000,2,427,4.756756756756757

8181394,4,B000NTPGCA,"Growing up in Cleveland suburbs (before cable tv) I watched  ""Reruns"" of westerns Gunsmoke, Maverick, Wild wild West (which I really liked ... a western James Bond; I thought it was so cool - then). Sunday morning tv sucked (for a 10 year old kid), except for the 9 and 10 a.m showings of Bonanza and The Big Valley (before Lee Majors was the Six Million Dollar Man....).  I eventually heard about westerns Have Gun-Will Travel with Richard Boone and wondered why there were never ""reruns"".  Just recently H & I has been showing Have Gun and it is not as good as I expected ... Unlike Rawhide and, finally, WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE with Steve McQueen.
Yes, I know, shows like Rawhide and, especially, WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE are not great but both are better than just average ""novelty"" shows only of note for casting eventual movie icons ""Clint"" and the King of Cool himself, Steve McQueen.  It's mostly cool seeing these reruns for the first time, after all these years.
The bad episode of DEAD OR ALIVE SEASON 2 is the obviously NOT Indian kid given WAY to big a part.  Ughh.
Otherwise, Josh Randall and his sawed off Winchester '92 are, generally, a cool enough place to start watching some old, ""rerun"" westerns (even when McQueen begins too mumble like he's channeling James Dean from movie ""Giant"" or something..).
So, keep in mind I am giving WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE SEASON 2 a 4 star rating - at best - due in large part to the really inexpensive less than $8.00.  The show does get repetitious with Bounty hunter Randall getting knocked out a bit too often and easily.
Anyways, one episode of note is the quite entertaining dirty duo of Warren Oates and Wayne Rogers(!) (M*A*S*H) as very conniving bad guys
The black and white is very nicely restored too.
I also saw some original black and white Gunsmoke (Marshall Dillon) recently that looked nowhere near as good as Wanted DEAD OR ALIVE.  Dillon much grainier.
And, hey, there is an xtra feature on disc 4 about The Women of Wanted Dead or Alive!  It's not great or anything but it is an extra 10 minutes of (some) highlight footage that was/is not mentioned on SEASON 2's box cover.
John Carradine pops up (talk about somebody who was in everything!) late in season in a 'hanging' episode that is 'almost' real good.  The eventual ending falters.
By the way (worthless tidbit) John Carradine is actually in Guinness Book of World Records for most movie and tv appearances of any actor ever.",1491264000,,2446,4.604597701149426
