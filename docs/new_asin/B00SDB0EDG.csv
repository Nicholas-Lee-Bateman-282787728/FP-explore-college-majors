6980018,5,B00SDB0EDG,"For centuries they called tuberculosis, captain of death. By the dawn of nineteen century it had killed one in seven of all the people it had ever lived, more than any other illness. Greeks called it ""Consumption"" as they did in the U.S., or ""Wasting Disease"" since people coughed themselves to death. One in seven all over the world is what they knew then with hardly any telecommunication or surveying in between continents in regard to health. In 1884, American doctor Edward Livingstone Trudeau, a Columbia College graduate verified Robert Kochs findings, a German physician, scientist and 1905 Nobel Laureate. In November 1954, Larry miller, the last tuberculosis patient left Trudeau Sanatorium. In 1980, tuberculosis in US spiked as a result of Aids epidemic. Since then it has become more common with nearly ten thousand cases in the U.S. and nine million worldwide.

After watching this documentary you will have more appreciation for clean clear cold air and better understanding of the killing power of tuberculosis. Bravo.",1423699200,24,1034,5.191616766467066
6980035,5,B00SDB0EDG,"This is one of the better documentaries I've watched on disease and plague and how it affected history.  In this particular documentary, the focus is on the United States and an American doctor who was influenced by a European doctor and his findings based on test studies.  Interestingly, this documentary highlights a different aspect of the great rush to the west. In school, I remember learning about the Gold Rush but I don't recall learning about the rush to the Western United States by those that were ill and thought fresh air and being away from the city could help heal them.  It was definitely rather mind-boggling just how much this plague influenced many of the cities we see today.  This plague was vicious and so highly contagious, it's rather amazing that we don't give it much of a thought anymore thanks to the wonderful doctors that were able to really isolate and study the plague. The documentary explains all the Sanatoriums that popped up in the US, why and why they were later shut down. The documentary kept my attention the entire time, I didn't find myself bored at any point, and once it ended I actually wanted more.  It's definitely worth anyone's time to view it and learn about the forgotten plague that plagued so many people for thousands of years.  Hard to believe that you and I were saved from it by maybe forty-fifty years at best.",1513468800,6,1370,4.6875
6980036,5,B00SDB0EDG,Great documentary. This really made me question some of the values that Seventh Day Adventists say about their beliefs and why they started hospitals etc. A great learning opportunity for anyone in healthcare or things related to Public Health. If you like this one you should also watch the one on Ellis Island!,1512777600,2,312,4.90566037735849

Drug resistant TB is back now, having found its way here again. Please be careful.

This was an excellent, informative documentary. Being really old, I certainly remember The March Of Dimes, from the 1950s. It went on forever, it seemed.",1512259200,2,312,4.867924528301887

6980041,5,B00SDB0EDG,"This is a story not known or understood even by medical professionals.  I remember being on the staff of a hospital and asking the administration WHY did they not test the patients we cared for.  I just got a long stare.  Some coworkers had a new patient who they found out later had active syphilis.....so, I am sure there was active TB around as well.  Health professionals are NOT protected.  We have the tests so use them to protect the caregivers!!!!  End of my ""soapbox"" presentation.",1510876800,2,490,4.6395348837209305
6980042,5,B00SDB0EDG,A fascinating movie. I had no idea that the early settlers in Los Angeles were TB sufferers looking for a cure,1510790400,,110,4.285714285714286

6980059,5,B00SDB0EDG,"These are the many names of TB throughout history. A disease so deadly and so prevalent for so long that it's bizarre how it might be so forgotten by the general public.

One of the best documentaries I've seen in a while.  Not due to any bells and whistles in its presentation... but because I learned so much about a disease I already knew something about.  It's based in part on the book by Sheila Rothman, ""Living in the Shadow of Death: Tuberculosis and the Social Experience of Illness in American History.""

I think one of the most interesting aspects of the documentary is that it shows the changing views of people with TB.  And the changing treatments.  In earlier times, people didn't understand germs and TB victims were... victims.  One view was that there was a ""climate cure"" for consumption... that being in fresh, natural air and environments could help.  Eventually, land developers had an impact on those looking for a climate cure and lured people into new, unsettled or developing territory.  The city of Pasadena started as a colony of consumptives from Indiana!  Los Angeles was initially ""a city of invalids"" (many newcomers arriving by train to LA were actually greeted by a 30 piece band in 1886).

But new cities paid a serious price for their recruiting success... they didn't have the resources to care for so many poor and sick.

Understanding the contagion ultimately brought about a serious stigma on the individual because the disease was so wildly contagious.  By the 1890s the medical community got a clue about the bacteria/germs and the name ""Consumption"" was dropped and replaced with the name that linked it to the bacteria... Tuberculosis.  People were shunned, isolated, quarantined in subtle and extreme ways.  It's interesting to see how prevention of the disease impacted education campaigns, clothes, beards, hygiene, and working conditions and labor laws.  So many cultural changes... because people had to.

Then came the streptomycin breakthrough in the 1940s... then other antibiotics treatments, and by 1950, most were recovering... sanatoriums closed, things changed, life improved... we began to forget.  But the end of the documentary reminds us we're certainly not free of the disease.  In the 1980s, TB spiked as a result of the AIDS epidemic and drug resistant TB has become more common since then.  There are nearly ten thousand cases of TB in the US and 9 million worldwide.

Sure leaves you something to think about.",1479859200,7,2475,5.002444987775061

6980100,5,B00SDB0EDG,"Great documentary. I believe this movie is based on, or owes a lot to, a book that has the same name. I have been interested in tuberculosis ever since I read that book. This movie adds a lot of detail to the story and tells how tuberculosis has changed our lives even today. For instance, men started to shave off their beards because it was believed that TB germs would be trapped in ""dirty beards"", and woman started wearing short skirts and dresses because long garments dragged on the sidewalk where people with TB spit, and it spread the disease.
TB has been removed from the consciousness of most of us in the USA, but in many parts of the  world it is still a big problem. Highly recommend this movie.",1454889600,7,709,4.412213740458015

In fact, after watching The Forgotten Plague, I realize there is an awful lot we didn't learn about in school!

This documentary was extremely well done and I would highly recommend it. HOWEVER, it is scary how many people had TB and how prevalent it was. Even today, it is even more scary how many people have TB in our society.",1443139200,3,557,4.514851485148514
6980137,4,B00SDB0EDG,"This was a very interesting documentary to watch. Of course in other reviews I have written of videos dealing with historical events I have stated I am a bit of a history nerd. But really this is something a lot of people I think would find interesting. It looks into one of the most deadly plagues that has stymied as well as kill humans for over 3,000 years. Referred to a lot before the 20th century as ""consumption"" it is of course more well known today as tuberculosis.

This documentary titled ""The Forgotten Plague"" is an excellent production from the PBS series ""American Experience"". It looks naturally at how this deadly disease affected this country and what measures were being done to try to combat and hopefully eliminate TB once and for all. But what makes this interesting for anyone to watch isn't just how and what was done in the medical field to find a solution to cure it. It also looks at how living with this epidemic would effect everyday life for Americans from women's fashions to men's facial hair to cities originally formed as places for patients of TB to come to rest and with hope recover from having it. One of the more interesting parts to the program is a couple of TB survivors who came down with the disease as young adults and tell their experience what it was like living with TB while at the same time watching family and friends who succumbed to it. This is not some dry fact filled documentary. This is a documentary that shows the human side to this plague and how it effected everyone whether they had TB themselves or not. And that is what makes this program interesting to watch regardless if you are a history nerd like me or someone hated taking history in school. Sadly as is pointed out at the end TB is still with us thanks in part to the rise of the AIDS virus outbreak in the '80s. The fight goes on to eradicate this plague. But there is an old saying, ""Knowledge is power"". If Americans take the time to watch this documentary it will help to have a greater awareness what this disease is about and what can be done to hopefully make TB one day one less concern to worry about for humans everywhere.",1443052800,5,2153,4.450632911392405

6980145,5,B00SDB0EDG,"This documentary was totally fascinating! I had no previous idea of the incredible scope of the disease and what it did to people's lives. The most interesting part was the revelation that many cities were either started or grew because of folks with ""consumption"" seeking better climates - cities like Colorado Springs and Albuquerque. Climate turned out not to be a factor but that knowledge didn't stop the developers from advertising areas as great for restoring health. This story pointed out how difficult it is for new ways of looking at things to be accepted. TB could have been cured at least a decade before had the doctors and scientists listened to new research results.  Most every documentary like this I watch could be used in classrooms not just for historical purposes, but as catalysts for conversations about how much in our world has changed and sadly how much of it has not.

8698171,5,B00SDB0EDG,"Like another reviewer it was in my watch list for a while, but I put off watching it... WATCH THIS !  I agree with another commenter they didn't teach this in school, they should have.  Our education system is so lacking and boring because of what they neglect to teach.
  When I heard Salman Waksman  found streptomycin in soil i immediately googled him.  I read the ACA article that came up 1st above Wikipedia on Bing from my fIre tablet.
  There was a Biblical sounding quote but not Biblical ?  By Ecclesiasticus XXXVIII ,4-1. The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them.  I didn't find it in the Bible, so I assume he was an early Greek or something writer.
  Well I've read several stories about eating dirt for curing certain ailments, one was the guy who started a vitamin company, he had an uncureable colon type disease where he'd wasted away to being very thin.  His father brought him a bag of dirt and told him to eat it and he got well ! Evidently he was missing enzymes or something from his system.  I know of more stories also.
  The point that struck me immediately is how we've polluted all our soils, from farming also all the household chemicals they sell us for cleaning, laundry, all those scented pellets, sprays, air fresheners are all chemicals.  Lawn chemicals etc on and on....  Good soil is a living mass of all kinds of things.  We got one of the best cures from soil, yet we went on polluting it because we were told and sold all these chemicals by people or corporations who only cared about getting rich.
  America has to stop idolizing rich people !  They care nothing about the environment or anyone else's health or anything.",1533427200,,1708,4.4772727272727275
