8092424,5,B000BTGXX8,a wonderful film chronicling the emergence of the bossa nova sound in Rio de Janeiro in the fifties and sixties.  Interviews as well as vintage and contemporary performances by the original artists make this film a treasure for  fans of the genre. The dialogue and lyrics are in Portuguese but the language of music has no bounds. It's unfortunate that this delightful documentary is no longer available according to Amazon.,1233964800,,424,5.042857142857143
