  The job of notifying next of kin by the Army Casualty Notification Unit is an extremely sensitive one. Such a job is not entrusted to just anyone in the military--you have to undergo significant training before you're assigned to such a specialized unit. That's why it's hard to believe that Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) would be thrust into the job when he only has three months of enlistment time left. What's more, would the Sergeant have been chosen since he's only recently come back from Iraq and may have been traumatized there? As for his training, his commanding officer, Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), merely throws a training manual in his lap and expects him to learn the job as they go along.

  To confess, I'm a bit biased against movies such as 'The Messenger' because I find characters who like themselves to be vastly more compelling and believable than those who don't. In general, characters who don't like themselves are dull and rarely add to the dramatic flow of the narrative (can you imagine a sad-sack Tony Soprano ever capturing the public's imagination?). The strategy of the Messenger's scenarists is to start us off with the two angst-ridden soldiers, Montgomery and Stone, and eventually show how they redeem themselves by overcoming their depressing background and circumstances.

  Montgomery is basically a putz who can't accept the fact that his former girlfriend has dumped him and is now engaged to someone else (how many sad-sack soldiers do you know who would actually show up at an ex-girlfriend's wedding intoxicated and wearing unwashed military fatigues?). The implication of course is that somehow, due to being traumatized in Iraq, he would end up acting that way. The contrived wedding scene is designed to show Montgomery at his lowest moment--after acting in such a boorish manner, he can now redeem himself by lending a helping hand to Olivia (Samantha Morton), the widow who he recently notified that her husband had been killed in action.

  Similarly, Captain Stone also has self-esteem issues. On the surface, his by-the-book demeanor masks a deep self-hatred. This is manifested in his constant skirt-chasing and avoidance of any meaningful relationships with women. The basic question arises: would the Military actually have put someone like Captain Stone in charge of an Army Casualty Notification Unit (i.e. someone so broken and negative?). I would suggest that such a negative character is a complete exaggeration anyway, designed merely to create dramatic scenarios where none would exist truly in reality. But even if such a character existed, he would probably be the last chosen by the military to head a Casualty Notification Unit.

  It takes a good deal of time before the central conflict comes to a head between Stone and Montgomery. And that is basically Montgomery believes in being a little more sensitive when notifying the next of kin as opposed to Stone who wants to follow 'procedures'. That's about the essence of the conflict between the two principals and when they finally confront each other, it's not much of a payoff. The sub-plot involves Montgomery trying to start things up with Olivia--his decision to not make the moves on her is designed to show that he's a 'good guy' after all and through his efforts to help her, shows that he's attained a measure of redemption.

  The Messenger also consists of various scenes in which the next of kin are notified of the deaths of their loved one's. Given the variety of the people we meet, it's probably the most interesting aspect of the film. Steve Buscemi's performance is probably the most notable (for better or worse) of these characters, where he strikes Montgomery after being notified about the death of his son, and later offers a rather predictable apology.

  I've read that the men and women who perform the job of the Casualty Notification Units are dedicated, trained professionals who by the nature of their employment, must set an example by living lives of great integrity (unlike the two troubled malcontents in 'The Messenger'). The contrived characters of 'The Messenger' do nothing to enhance the reputation of these specialized units; rather, their opposition feels artificial, contrived, all part of a plot artifice that calls for the type of conflict one might expect to see in the movies but never in real life. While I have no doubt, 'The Messenger' was meticulously researched as to how these Notification units operate, it still feels like it was written by an outsider. 'The Messenger' might have gotten many of its 'facts' right, but unfortunately I could not believe I was watching a story about real people.",1265760000,61,4735,5.037131882202305
4077919,5,B0036RPM98,"A tremendous movie - I'd not heard too much about it going in and was blown away by the tale crafted and presented by director and co-writer (with Alessandro Camon), Oren Moverman.  Why isn't this great, small film getting Oscar buzz?  It deserves it.

The movie is structured as a series of searing vignettes in which two Army officers (Woody Harrelson, Ben Foster) notify the 'N.O.K.' (next of kin) of a family member's death while serving in Iraq.  None of these encounters unspool in the same way - we see how many variables enter into how each notification plays out - the emotional state of the message's recipient, where the news gets delivered, the current state of the relationship between the NOK and the deceased, and - most notably - the current emotional state of the messenger himself.

What weaves the vignettes together is the evolution of the relationship between the two messengers.  Harrelson is seen first as harshly mentoring Foster as to how to do this very delicate task...then, slowly and very realistically, a bond builds between the two of them.  It's visceral and tangible.  The screenwriters play this out with nuance and deftness.  But they call upon Harrelson and Foster to make it work.  Foster is very good.  Harrelson is other-worldly good.  In a perfect world, he'd walk away with an Oscar.  He presents a mixture of paper-thin bravado that, when scratched, yearns for companionship.

The movie's two best scenes, however, both involve a third person: Samantha Morton.  There's the heart-stopping scene when Harrelson and Foster inform her of her husband's death.  The emotions this brings out in Morton's character are...puzzling and not quite as expected.  It's such a finely acted scene that the New York Times spent an entire article breaking it down - Morton's shaking and re-shaking of the messengers' hand, her deflecting to the messengers (""this must be hard for you""), her glancing back to the house worriedly a couple of times, Harrelson's character's misinterpretation of a shirt she's drying on the line.  All of this is important.  Its meaning comes out in pieces as the movie progresses.

The other scene of note:  many days later in Morton's kitchen between she and Morton.  It can't be explained here without a plot revelation.  But, again, it's expertly scripted, directed and acted.",1264982400,5,2334,5.005194805194805
4077920,5,B0036RPM98,"With the exception of Woody Harrelson getting nominated for Best Supporting Actor, THE MESSENGER has not been getting the attention that it deserves from the critics and awards.  This is the film that should've been nominated for Best Picture (Drama) by the Golden Globe Awards.  This is the film that should've been nominated for Best Picture by the Broadcast Film Critics Awards.  With the exception of the Independent Spirit Awards, THE MESSENGER is being grossly overlooked.  I think it may be because it is not released by a major distributor.  And it is overshadowed by THE HURT LOCKER.  To tell you the truth, I have seen both films, and I'll take THE MESSENGER over THE HURT LOCKER anyday.  THE HURT LOCKER was more suspenseful, but THE MESSENGER did a much better job examining the human condition from both the soldiers and the civilians' point of view.  In a way it reminded me of a contemporary version of ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT because it depicted the horrors of the war, and the effects that it had on both the soldiers and their loved ones.  I highly recommend this film.  It is one of the best films of 2009.  One last thing--it is about time Woody Harrelson wins an Oscar for his performance as an actor.  He is incredible in this film.",1264032000,72,1261,4.63063063063063
4077921,5,B0036RPM98,"I would classify this quiet small movie among the brillant average ones, if such a label exists. There is nothing outstanding about it (maybe apart from the main actor), it does not really have a message despite its title, it carries no ideology, it doesn't proselytize. Plain realism.
A simple story: a man (Foster) returns from Iraq, a staff sergeant, wounded, highly decorated, sceptical about the merits of his decoration, and for the last 3 months in the army he gets assigned to carry 'the message' to next of kin of soldiers killed in action or otherwise. He resists in the beginning, gets broken in by an a...hole of a superior, played by Woody H., who in the course of events turns out to be rather more human than needed. We follow the duo to a few assigments, each hard in so many different ways. We follow the private lives of the two men: WH an alcoholic and sex addict, Foster disturbed by his old girl friend's desertion, by loneliness. The two make uncomfortable friends. Foster's character develops a shy friendship with one of the women that he had to notify. The ending is open, like in real life. All endings are open until the message comes.",1262736000,5,1162,4.618357487922705
4077922,5,B0036RPM98,"I have seldom seen a more moving or seamless antiwar film than Oren Moverman's ""The Messenger."" Its Iraq War theme makes it absolutely up to the minute, yet its portrayal of the raw grief that war creates echoes throughout human history. In some ways, ""The Messenger"" serves as a companion piece to Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker."" ""The Hurt Locker"" portrays the effect of the Iraq War on combat soldiers; ""The Messenger"" concentrates more on its effect on the loved ones waiting at home.

Ben Foster, who was so excellent in ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""Six Feet Under,"" exceeds even those achievements as Sgt. Will Montgomery, an Iraq War soldier recovering from grievous physical and psychic wounds who receives the unwelcome assignment of notifying the survivors of soldiers killed in action. Making the assignment even harder is Capt. Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), a hard-nosed military lifer who commands Montgomery to stick to the script: never touch a survivor, and never express more than the most perfunctory sympathy. Stone, a recovering alcoholic, has his own problems: a veteran of the First Persian Gulf War, he never saw any combat worth the name, and suffers a world of guilt he tries to hide by playing the martinet and chasing every skirt he sees. Meanwhile, Montgomery, who has been jilted by his high-school sweetheart (Jena Malone), starts to develop feelings--totally against the rules--for a young military widow (Samantha Morton).

Featuring sharp dialogue and brilliant performances (including one by Steve Buscemi as the father of a fallen soldier), ""The Messenger"" is a powerfully moving cinematic experience.",1261267200,46,1631,5.221374045801527

4078109,2,B0036RPM98,The Casualty Notification job has to be one of the worst jobs in the world  The idea of assigning a wounded hero who has lost close friends to the job for his last three months of his enlistment is just appalling.  I guess I would end up in Leavenworth because I would refuse to do the job.  It would seem cruel to me.  That is the plot of the movie and it is a slim one because it is not handled well and the two men involved are not very likeable.  Woody Harrelson in a officer who longed for action and never saw it and is heartless except for feeling sorry for not having seen action.  Ben Foster seems too wooden and the idea of hitting on a widow of another dead soldier seems creepy.  There really isn't much to the story and if it had not been for Woody Harrelson getting an Oscar nomination for the role I would have given this a one star.  I don't think he deserved the nomination for this one any way.  This is a serious job and I didn't care for the low life way the soldiers were portrayed.  Pass on this one.,1425081600,,1022,4.065

As a veteran I wasn't looking for military accuracy or any more details of any missions. But I was left wondering where the movie was going.

They also went way too far with the sex scenes. Ben Fosters role was very believable. He is a great actor.

This movie took the erosion of war on individuals a step beyond the battlefield and showed how those who simply had to deliver bad news to family members of lost soldiers were themselves just as damaged by the news as were the affected soldiers and the recipients of notification of their sons' and daughters' deaths.  One character sought solace through a human connection; one through drink.  This was not an easy set of circumstances to observe, hence the movie could hardly be called diverting entertainment, but as rank and authority reversed themselves during the story's progression, the viewer came to realize that the true nature of society will never be revealed through titles and arbitrary authority.",1419811200,,832,5.33587786259542

4078366,2,B0036RPM98,"While it must have sounded great in development, The Messenger is one of those movies that just badly missed in execution.  It covers a number of important topics - the effect on families of losing a loved one, the effect on soldiers for surviving - and within the limits of the script the actors do get into their characters.  Unfortunately, the overall screenplay just doesn't work.  2 stars.

Part of one good (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Were-Soldiers/dp/B000J159N8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Were Soldiers</a>) and most of one great (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taking-Chance/dp/B009M8Q3O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taking Chance</a>) film deals with the notification process for military casualties.  The Messenger nominally covers it in a much deeper way, involving the effect on next of kin.  Add that to the PTSD suffered by the two main characters, and the topic is very much worthy of a movie.

Unfortunately, the film doesn't execute, largely because the notification process is so far from reality that it takes the rest of the film down with it.  Another reviewer, Kay Cruz, explains the notification process from both ends.  That review is worth a read.

Another glimpse of the process from a third party can be found by searching for ""death's messenger vice"", which tells the story of a casualty notification officer, CPT Siemion.  A couple lines in the interview explain much of what the filmmakers got wrong: ""One thing is the idea that no job is more important than this job. So, if you're in the middle of an important brief with a Colonel and you get called to give a notification, you say, ""Gotta go.""

That urgency and respect is missing, and it fatally wounds the film.  While Harrison and Foster act well, the characters and situations just aren't that believable.

It's a shame too, as a movie that used notifications to reflect on how deaths wound survivors - both family and military - could have been great.  Unfortunately, this isn't that movie.  Two stars.",1419292800,,2078,5.446875

Not only did I go through the training myself at Fort Rucker, AL, I also am a U.S. Army Veteran and an Iraqi War Widow.  (The picture included is of my son and I visiting our hero's grave at Arlington National Cemetery.)

I have had the heartbreaking experience of hearing ""The Knock"" and having two men in Class A uniforms come to my home at 7:00 in the morning to inform me that my beloved husband was killed in action just outside Kirkuk, Iraq.  There is so much wrong with this movie, to include the involvement these soldiers had after notification.  That isn't how it works, at least not on the Active Duty side of the house.  The CNO and a Chaplain notify the family and then they leave.  It is set up that the original notification team members do not stay, because they are the ones the family now associates with bringing them the horrific news of their soldier's death.  Shortly after notification, the newly assigned CAO (Casualty Assistance Officer) makes contact with the family and they are the ones that will be available 24/7 to help the family through the paperwork, the funeral and entitlements process.  Also, a soldier doesn't get assigned this job as a permanent duty.  They attend the class and get put on a roster.  If, God forbid, a soldier falls, then Casualty Affairs will choose someone from the roster that is the same rank or higher of the fallen soldier to act as CAO.  They are then pulled from their unit and regular job and temporarily assigned to the family.  Once they have completed everything necessary (in my case it took six months), they return to their unit and regular job.  If they are on the notification team, then they perform the task of notifying the next of kin, but do not leave their unit or regular job as notification usually only takes 24-hours.

I can't even get into the relationship between the new widow and her notification soldier!  I am not saying that some widows haven't gotten involved with their CAOs.  I am sure it happens.  It's is a very traumatic time and this soldier is constantly helping and offering support.  But I think it is incredibly rare.  And it made me cringe to see how this woman was portrayed.

I had such great hopes that this movie would show what it really is like for not only our brave men and women who have to go up to the door of a family and change their lives forever with one knock, and also show what it is like for those of us on the receiving side of this devastating news.  Instead I just felt angry and betrayed at how this was all portrayed!

If you want to watch a movie that really will touch you and open your eyes to what it means to honor those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""Taking Chance"" with Kevin Bacon.  [...]",1419206400,80,2861,4.48742746615087

In my opinion, this movie did not receive the attention from the critics that it earned as it does not buy into our country's belief in ""the mythology of war"" ie-bravery, heroism, redemptive suffering, dying for a cause, glory, honor etc. These items may or amy not come into play at various times in the film- but things are not ""prettied"" up in a neat and clean way. As far as believability- I'd give it 100%  The people whose children die in battle are shown as the ordinary workaday and poor folks that they normally are. Sadly nowadays, the poor fight the wars that benefit the wealthy and large corporations. This film undercuts out national belief in the cultural norm of ""the mythology of war"" by showing the heartbreaking grief of a parent/wife on learning that their son/daughter has died for a questionable cause -as many Americans- and many of our political leaders felt about the Iraq war was a mistake and an atrocity",1392508800,,1087,4.661458333333333

It was rather boring much of the time. The pace is very slow and the subject matter is of the sort that one wonders just how many people who see this film would really want to explore the tragic task of informing next of kin that there son, daughter, wife or husband was killed in battle. I am also not sure why some people are comparing the film to Hurt Locker, which was a film completely removed and totally not at all like this one what so ever. This is not a war film at all. There is no violence in this film except one fist fight which we really never see. This film is more about how two military officers handle the task of informing people their loved ones had died in the course of battle. Though Harrelson gave a perfect performance, I don't know that the role here was all that demanding either. Hes certainly very good in the role, but its not a character that a lot is demanded of from an actor. Anyway several times I kept saying under my breath things like ""Damn, their right, this movie is rather dull and uninspiring"". At the same time I was interested enough to keep watching. I mean after all the subject at hand was important. I felt however the same job given to the women back home in Randall Wallace's film 'We were soldiers' was much more moving and heartbreaking.

this movie highlights an aspect of military life that seems to exist well outside of the public view.
i know i couldn't notify parents and spouses that their soldier has been killed.
but how could a person refuse to?
it's a sacred duty.  sometimes sacred duties must be performed by unholy people.

the most moving moments of the movie are when they must notify next-of-kin.
there's suspense there because you don't know how the person will react.
i love that the movie doesn't try to wrap things into a tidy package because sometimes, life is just messed up.

The conflict created by these rules was also very real, you felt yourself wanting to console these people who were hurting so bad, you felt the plight of the characters in not being able to do so. It was all very real and believable. Then apparently the writers ran out of ideas.

Spoiler alert, I guess.

The second half of the movie is a cliched mess. Soldiers who were so professional and dignified in the first half are now so vile, drunk, and obnoxious I was embarrassed for them.

His one-liners are priceless. (Mamma said they'll be days like this...)  I was afraid that this movie might just make me burst into tears, but I didn't cry at all.  And thats saying something.  This movie is not meant to be depressing.  I actually think it's the opposite.  Every civillian should be required by law to see this movie.  The story told in this movie made me think of how, in the past, WWII and Vietnam, it wasn't just our troops at war, America as a whole was at war.  ""Support the troops"" was more than just a slogan.  It seems like the general public view the war as a 30 second newsclip on CNN or FOX news.  We forget that those boys and girls fighting over there were our classmates, played on our soccer teams, went to prom & now they are far away seeing real things that we choose to avoid talking about.  Most of us are more concerned about the newest gadget or who the bachalor gave the rose to.  This movie addresses that apathy, I think, and also addresses the reality of what a returned soldier goes thru.  The most heart wrenching parts of the movie are when the Messengers must deliver the news to next of kin whose loved one was just killed.

4078421,5,B0036RPM98,"You think your job`s bad?  Imagine being Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster), whose duty it is to deliver death notices to the families and loved ones of soldiers killed in action.  With just three months of active duty left before he's honorably discharged from the service, this decorated war hero has been placed under the tutelage of Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), who's been doing this sort of thing for so long now that it has become almost - but not quite - routine.  Things become complicated, however, when Will becomes romantically attracted to Olivia Pitterson (Samantha Morgan), one of the young widows to whom he relates the shattering news.  But the real focus is on the conflict and uneasy friendship between the by-the-book, struggling alcoholic Stone, who harbors a certain degree of guilt for never having actually served in battle, and the moody, sensitive, and slightly shell-shocked Will who's seen more blood-soaked action than he cares to think about.  Yet, neither is a stereotype, for each is a complex individual dealing in his own way with the traumatizing effects of war - be it on the home front or on the field of battle.

""Less is more"" is the defining principle of ""The Messenger,"" a vivid and powerful movie that understands that there is often more drama in what is left unsaid than what is actually spoken.  Everything that occurs in the film seems to happen beneath the surface, as each of the characters tries to put up a brave front even when lives and souls are being torn asunder right before their eyes.  Screenwriters Oren Moverman and Alessandro Camon are not afraid to give each scene its due, even if that means letting it play out at great length or having the characters fumble in their efforts to articulate what it is they're trying to say.  The emotions are raw and complex in this film, and Moverman's elegiac direction does full justice to the seriousness of the subject.  He allows his characters the dignity of space, yet is never so detached from them as to render them objects of curiosity or pity.  It's an impressive debut effort for the obviously gifted Moverman.

The scenes in which the two men deliver the news to the various loved ones are staged and executed brilliantly, beautifully capturing the manifold ways in which people deal with sudden tragedy.  Particularly effective is Steve Buscemi's devastating cameo turn as a father who can't accept the reality of his son's death and, thus, strikes out at any convenient target as a means of channeling his rage.

Foster and Harrelson deliver breathtaking, perfectly calibrated, award-worthy performances, and they are matched every step of the way by a first-rate cast of supporting actors who never resort to grandstanding in the brief moments they appear on screen.

The one false note occurs when the two drunk officers crash the wedding party of Will's former girlfriend (played by Jena Malone, the young version of Jodie Foster in ""Contact""), but it is a minor weakness in a film that earns each and every one of the tears it asks its audience to shed.  And for a movie in which death plays such a central role, ""The Messenger"" still manages to affirm that emotional and psychological healing, though a long and painful process, can actually be achieved in the end.

Without a doubt, one of 2009's best films.",1294963200,7,3344,4.859154929577465

The whole drama goes within two characters whose task is to inform relatives about casualties. What called my attention the most was not only the moving story and the elegant tone in which it's told but also Ben Foster's acting. He's absolutely GREAT! Woody Harrelson (Oscar nominee as Supporting Actor for this movie) is also excellent, probably his very best role so far, and so is Samantha Norton in some heart-breaking moments that consolidate her figure as one of the finest movie actresses at present. A wonderful movie, dramatically intense, with brilliant, unforgetable performances.",1293494400,4,749,5.147540983606557
4078423,5,B0036RPM98,"Now playing on cable, this 2009 film held my interest, saddened me and showed me a point of view I had never thought of before  -- that of the soldiers whose job it is to inform the next of kin that their loved ones are dead.  This is a serious film about a serious subject and it is all done with a sensitivity that makes it all too real.

The film stars Ben Foster as an American soldier wounded in Iraq who has just been released from the hospital and has a few months left to serve out his term of enlistment.  His new assignment partners him with career officer Woody Harrelson, (who won an Academy Award nomination for this performance). He teaches Foster the ropes of how to deal with their uncomfortable and important assignment.  It is their job to personally deliver their sad message to the next of kin in person before the death has been made public.  They show up at the person's place of residence.  Often, just their presence is message enough.  But sometimes they have to spell it out.  It is always a heartbreaking experience.  And it takes a toll on the messengers as well.

Harrelson is a fast talking loudmouth recovering alcoholic;  Foster has not quite recovered from his emotional and physical wounds which include eye problems.  Together they form a bond and, as the film progresses, their back stories come out.  Foster's former girlfriend has left him for another man.  Harrelson talks a lot of military talk but there is doubt that his exploits really happened.  And Foster finds himself attracted to a young widow with a child who he has just informed that her husband is dead.  Little my little the plot becomes more complex and the characterizations deepen.

Although the film is quite depressing, it makes some important points.  I enjoyed it with the one criticism that it dragged on just a wee bit too long for my taste.",1290902400,6,1853,4.594512195121951
4078424,5,B0036RPM98,"A tremendous movie - I'd not heard too much about it going in and was blown away by the tale crafted and presented by director and co-writer (with Alessandro Camon), Oren Moverman.  This film got Woody Harrelson a well-deserved Oscar nomination.  It deserved a Best Picture nomination to go along with it.

The movie is structured as a series of searing vignettes in which two Army officers (Woody Harrelson, Ben Foster) notify the 'N.O.K.' (next of kin) of a family member's death while serving in Iraq.  None of these encounters unspool in the same way - we see how many variables enter into how each notification plays out - the emotional state of the message's recipient, where the news gets delivered, the current state of the relationship between the NOK and the deceased, and - most notably - the current emotional state of the messenger himself.

What weaves the vignettes together is the evolution of the relationship between the two messengers.  Harrelson is seen first as harshly mentoring Foster as to how to do this very delicate task...then, slowly and very realistically, a bond builds between the two of them.  It's visceral and tangible.  The screenwriters play this out with nuance and deftness.  But they call upon Harrelson and Foster to make it work.  Foster is very good.  Harrelson is other-worldly good.  In a perfect world, he'd have walked away with that Oscar.  He presents a mixture of paper-thin bravado that, when scratched, yearns for companionship.

The movie's two best scenes, however, both involve a third person: Samantha Morton.  There's the heart-stopping scene when Harrelson and Foster inform her of her husband's death.  The emotions this brings out in Morton's character are...puzzling and not quite as expected.  It's such a finely acted scene that the New York Times spent an entire article breaking it down - Morton's shaking and re-shaking of the messengers' hand, her deflecting to the messengers (""this must be hard for you""), her glancing back to the house worriedly a couple of times, Harrelson's character's misinterpretation of a shirt she's drying on the line.  All of this is important.  Its meaning comes out in pieces as the movie progresses.

The other scene of note:  many days later in Morton's kitchen between she and Foster.  It can't be explained here without a plot revelation.  But, again, it's expertly scripted, directed and acted.",1288828800,,2397,5.027918781725888

How do I even begin to explain the brilliance of The Messenger? It's a tear jerking journey of two men's quest to respectfully and consistently do the unimaginable: deliver the news to the loved ones of fallen soldiers.  In person, mind you.

I'll start by saying that this is the kind of film, much like Forrest Gump, where at its end we are sad it is over, and want to spend more time with the characters. Their story took a toll on us, sure; but we have fallen in love with them. This film has the hold over us that a great novel does. We spend so much time with the characters, that by the time the screen goes black or we reach the author's credit page, we feel like we've lost a close friend.

Aside from the amazing screenplay, and the personal way the movie is filmed, this feeling is due mainly to the sensational performances of Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson. Harrelson received his much deserved Oscar nomination, but where in the holy H-E-double hockey sticks was Ben Foster's nomination? This kid is continuously being overlooked in his movies, and it's growing tiresome.

I was in the Military for five years, and while I was in the Navy rather than the Army, I did a stretch of six months with them in Afghanistan. Six months may not sound like that long, but when you're in Afghanistan, there isn't much to do, so we got to know each other pretty well. The reason I'm telling you this is, both of these gentleman, Harrelson and Foster, were so convincing as U.S. soldiers, that real soldiers wouldn't know they were pretending, were it not for their fame.

I know that all I've done is go on and on about how great this film is without telling you anything about it, but there is a method to my madness found in faithful repetitive praise, here. And I'm not going to tell you much else folks; as you can see by looking only a few lines below, this review is almost over.

There is no reason to reveal too much in this case, for it is better served up fresh without knowing any details. And you already know all you need to, to tell if this is a film you would be interested in seeing. I will add that the film does not spend any time defending or bashing the war, or the choices our government has made. It simply tells the story of two extraordinary people and the demons they must face. And that my friends, is something we can all relate to as human beings; regardless of where we stand politically or where we may come from.",1288224000,2,2677,4.442857142857143
4078426,4,B0036RPM98,"This movie explores the second worst job in the army (of course fighting is the first), which is to give the news and condolences to the family of the dead soldier.

4078428,3,B0036RPM98,"With Netflix on-demand internet streaming on my bluray player, I get the opportunity to watch some great new release indie movies like The Messenger (2009). This finely crafted story about two Army officers who notify next of kin of the death of a solider is a surprising addition to the growing collection of Iraq/Afghanistan war movies.  I know the press and Hollywood like to talk about how these recent war movies of the last decade aren't making a big box office splash like Saving Private Ryan (1998) or Pearl Harbor (2001) did, and yet these films keep getting made and finding an audience.  And I'm definitely a member of that audience.  I don't think any of them are as good as Saving Private Ryan or the other great WWII movies of the last 15-20 years, but these wars are different and the movies reflect that. WWII will probably never be matched in its clarity and power of story.  Hitler was such a perfect black-and-white villain, whereas the Iraq and Afghanistan wars really have no ""clear"" villain.

The Messenger stars Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster, both giving some of the best performances of their careers.  Harrelson was rightly nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of a damaged army officer in this film. First time director Oren Moverman has mad a nice first film.  I really enjoyed the first half of the film as it built up emotionally, but I felt that the second half just drifted away without enough focus on plot.  It's definitely a film worth seeing for the good cinematography (as evidenced by the still images below that I captured from the trailer) and the great acting.",1286236800,,1626,4.74113475177305

Woody Harrelson, in an Oscar-nominated role, and Ben Foster deliver the performances of their careers as they portray conflicting views of patriotism and service to one's country. Both soldiers are coping with survivor's guilt, and their brutal struggle to make sense of their experiences in battle and in grief is both painful and cathartic. This is a well-written and emotionally honest film that moves slowly in spots, but its unflinching honesty provides redemption. If you overlooked this one in theaters (or if it never made it to your town), catch it on DVD.",1284163200,,719,5.0
4078431,5,B0036RPM98,"Ben Foster is brilliant in this movie.  The nuances of his performance are remarkable. He's one of the best actors I've seen in years.

The other actors also shine - Harrelson doing his usual great work, Steve Buscemi powerfully performing a small serious role, and Samantha Morton beautifully portraying the ambivalence of loss and attraction.

Amazing that this is Oren Moverman's directorial debut. The way he uses space between his actors is dancelike and stunning.

I was a Navy officer and I don't call myself a liberal.  I understand that some wars are necessary. That being said, this movie makes me want to join the next protest of America's military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It's about our kids dying over there and the devastation it wreaks on their families and the soul of America. See it.",1282435200,,815,4.912408759124087
4078432,5,B0036RPM98,"The Messenger is a superbly crafted film that shows us an aspect of war we don't often see on the screen--the military duty to give a ""casualty notification,"" which means they have to inform next of kin that their relative died while serving in the military. Just as others have said, this film is neither anti-war nor pro-war; it examines this single aspect of war, a horrendous consequence of war that no one can deny. The cinematography and the choreography are wonderful; and I am very impressed with the largely improvised scenes in which people are told their relative died. In addition, the script was wonderful and the casting couldn't have been done any better.

When the action begins, we meet Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) who has been injured in Iraq; his left eye and one of his legs were wounded and it's not at all certain that he will fully recover his sight in that eye and the complete use of his leg. Will has three months stateside to finish his enlistment; and he is consequently assigned to ""a sacred mission"" by Colonel Stuart Dorsett (Eamonn Walker): informing next of kin that their relatives have died while serving in the military. Especially because Will has no training in this field, Colonel Dorsett assigns Will to work with the tough as nails and by-the-book Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) so that Tony can show Will the ropes. At the same time Will has the bitter disappointment that his now former girlfriend Kelly (Jena Malone) has left him for another man while he was in Iraq.

We soon see that casualty notification isn't easy. Tony and Will get spit at, slapped in the face and more when the next of kin gets the bad news; their reactions are hard just to watch but it's all very realistic. However, one newly-widowed woman, Olivia (Samantha Morton) remains relatively calm and she instantly strikes Will as being remarkable; and gradually Will and Olivia develop a relationship that is strictly against military policy. Tony, of course, is against this although he can relate to Will's need for a woman; and while all this goes on Will's relationship with Tony develops in unforeseen ways as well.

The plot can go in several different directions from here but I don't like to give spoilers--I don't want to ruin it for you! However, I must say that Woody Harrelson gives a brilliant performance as Captain Tony Stone and Ben Foster plays his role very well. Look also for a solid performance by Will's old girlfriend Kelly (Jena Malone).

The DVD has some extras; there is an optional running commentary with director and co-writer Oren Moverman, Lawrence Inglee, Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson; and the ""Going Home"" brief featurette with the principle actors and filmmakers discussing the film is excellent. There's also a short film that has interviews with real life people, not actors, who have lost relatives in Iraq or Afghanistan and what their experience with casualty notification was like for them.

The Messenger seems rather overlooked and underrated as a motion picture and I'm not sure why this is. It deals very honestly with the human pain and suffering that go hand in hand with the horrific consequences of combat fighting in war. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to see a very high quality, timely film about war and people who like the actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections, too.",1282262400,6,3406,4.805460750853243

The two main characters seem interesting in the beginning, but unfortunately this movie had a meandering and ultimately unintelligent script and the two main characters ended up becoming not much more than charicatures. The direction was also poor -- the director allowed scenes to go on aimlessly, indulging himself and the actors rather than thinking of the story, and the best way to get it told. Part of his problem may have been that the movie just didn't have an ultimate direction, or ultimate reason for being.

I saw one occasion of family notification but the rest of what I saw and heard was vulgar language and nudity. It's too bad that so many movie makers seem to think they have to include such scenes in films in order for them to sell. In my opinion, adding such scenes does not honor our soldiers at all.

With all of the films out there today about the war I liked this second to The Hurt Locker.",1277424000,,376,4.094594594594595
4078439,5,B0036RPM98,"War films usually concentrate on the exploits of the war hero, charging into battle, guns ablaze, mowing down enemies without so much as a care in the world, and come out with nary a band-aid on their forehead. Occasionally, the best friend dies, in order to get the hero back on track and advance the plot. One never thinks of the people at home, waiting for the best friend to return. And one certainly never thinks of the people who have to notify those loved ones. This film centers on two such soldiers, who live to bring news and grief, as they deal with their own grief, in this quiet film ""The Messenger"".

Woody Harrelson turns in another award worthy performance as Captain Tony Stone, who teams up with just out of combat Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster)  to deliver news of combat deaths. Foster is dealing with an severe eye injury and an injury of the soul as he learns the details of this terrible job. On the heels of an unrequited love, Montgomery struggles with the tenets of the job as the two become a harbinger of death to those they meet. One particular widow strikes Mongomery's fancy, Olivia, who deals with the death of her husband as well as the growing attraction to the soldier who told her of it. The dichotomy between the two is delicious.

Yet, the film rests squarely on the shoulders of Harrelson and Foster, and together, the two make an intimidating and formidable pair. When either is alone, the film loses a bit of its luster, and you long for the two anti-heroes to come back together again. Kudos must be given to all of the actors who performed those loved ones receiving the news. There isn't a dishonest one in the bunch, starting with a small cameo by Steve Buscemi as an angry, irate father.

This isn't an easy film to watch. War isn't ever easy, and so it follows that the aftermath of it is even less so. This film celebrates all of that messiness, and honor, and valor, and realism with a honesty that is not often seen in movies now.",1277164800,3,1993,4.482093663911845
4078440,5,B0036RPM98,"I find that often times, the less information I know about a movie when I dim the lights and prepare to watch it, the more rewarding the experience turns out to be. Going into screenwriter Oren Moverman's directorial debut ""The Messenger"", I had heard some terrific things, but nothing about the story itself. It opens with Iraq War veteran Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) applying some prescription eye-drops to his freshly scarred eye, a result of a recent near-brush with death in battle. Soon to be discharged, Will is assigned to a three month post as a Casualty Notification Officer.

It is explained to Will that this is not only a vital duty, but a sacred one. He is mentored by Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), who has not experienced the action that Will has, and who has a strict policy regarding his job. The two soldiers walk up to doors belonging to deceased soldiers' next of kin, knock, and deliver the bad news. It is fascinating how Tony systematically explains to Will the method by which this is done, and then to see the method in action, often times failing and leading to a flurry of tears, aggression, denial and horror. Among the unfortunate souls that they meet are Dale Martin (Steve Buscemi), whose son has died, and Olivia Pitterson (Samantha Morton), whose husband has died.

Will begins to develop feelings for Olivia after he and Tony inform her of her husband's death. Moverman's script, written with Alessandro Camon, beautifully unfold the effects of war on people, and the conflicting choices that tug on Will's conscience as he tries to figure out whether or not his feelings for Olivia are ethical, honest, or even decent. It's a relationship that carefully walks a tightrope between appropriate and improper. Foster is terrific in this part, as he reaches out and goes to the darkest of places, playing a man who has seen terrible things and now has to be an angel of death to families of less fortunate soldiers than himself. One father comments on this, asking Will ""why aren't you dead instead of my son?""

Woody Harrelson is just as inspired, and brings an immense amount of controlled energy to Tony, who harbors much pain and sadness from having delivered the bad news so many times to so many people. He is also in AA, which is another clue that there is far more beneath his surface than he is willing to show. Having attained the rank of Captain, Tony may have made some bad decisions, and ended up on CNO duty through his own unstable temperament. The relationship that develops between Tony and Will seems familiar at first, but manages to evolve and to exude an undeniable power and originality that allows the two soldiers to constantly question the rules and methods of the job. These methods are challenged again and again, and it seems to get more and more difficult each time, rather than easier.

Tony sizes Olivia up when he first sees her, but Will finds it much harder to pinpoint what drives her and what her life is like. Samantha Morton, who I believe to be one of the finest actresses working, is incredibly moving and believable as usual as the wife of a fallen soldier who she claims died long before his final tour of duty. What makes this story work is that it doesn't solely focus on the Iraq War and its casualties and victims, but exists and works on a much broader and universal level. The ideas and questions that the film raises are intended to inspire more than just tears-they are intended to make you look at the situation from another perspective and to ponder upon your own beliefs and preconceptions. Moverman's direction is tremendous, as he handles each scene with great care and creates a subtle but effective atmosphere in the door to door scenes, which are some of the most heartbreaking pieces of film ever done.

""The Messenger"" somewhat resembles Katherine Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"", the best picture winner this year, structurally more than any other way. We have these two men going to people's doors, informing them of their loved one's demise, and then sort of getting lost in their own lives in between. In the case of this film, however, there is more to look at and study, as the story focuses on Will, Tony, and Olivia, showing how each manages to live in spite of the death that surrounds them. I enjoyed this movie on a different level than I enjoyed ""The Hurt Locker"", despite the similarities, and I think they both deserve to be recognized for their respective achievements.",1276905600,3,4479,4.7225063938618925
4078441,5,B0036RPM98,"Several years ago, The New Yorker Magazine had an article about the military personnel who was killed in action.  Article described the process of preparing body for the burial, shipment of the body to US and the family notification process.  This film focuses on the family notification process.

Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster play two soldiers paired up to perform this difficult task of notifying the immediate family about their sons' and daughters' death.  Their seemingly steely faces mask lots of pain both personal and professional that haunts them during the hours when they are alone.  It is amazing to watch these two actors show all the different reactions they see during their duty.  Regardless of family's reactions, each duty leaves a mark on their psyche in a manner that is impossible to describe.

Ben Foster steals the show in this film.  His experiences in Iraq, estrangement from his immediate family, disappointment in his long term relationship with his girlfriend and meeting with newly widowed Olivia (Samantha Morton) change him irrevokable in a ways he wants to conduct his duties with the Army and his personal life.

Movie is very well crafted.  Well acted. There are no ""filler"" scenes. A respectful study in how men and their families find the courage to deal honorably and honestly with the physically and emotionally wounding experiences of war.",1276300800,,855,4.5519480519480515
4078444,2,B0036RPM98,"Going into this movie, I expected to love it. Rave reviews, Oscar nominations, an interesting topic - what could go wrong? Quite a bit, unfortunately. First though, the positives. I think why so many people loved this movie is due to a few very powerful scenes. The moments of grief when family members learn of their loved ones death is hard to watch - it's so real and well done. Since you cannot just watch a movie where that happens over and over again, you have to develop a story around that - and that's where the problems come in. Ben Foster plays a soldier who is recovering from massive combat injuries. He is given the ""safe"" job of accompanying a more experienced notification officer (Harrelson) as an apprentice of sorts.  Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster turn in two very touching performances in a movie that ultimately is not deserving of their talent.

Where the movie veers into ""are you kidding me?!?!?!"" territory is when the young soldier starts to develop a relationship with one of the women he notifies of the loss of her husband. I won't spoil anything, but if you think the movie is going to justify both of their actions, you may be let down. A lot of the film is just an uncomfortable mess. Maybe that's the message we're supposed to be getting - war is messy - but well, I get that, I didn't need a movie to come along and tell me. So while a few scenes are definitely extraordinary, this movie is bogged down by ludicrousness to the point that I cannot recommend it as a whole.",1276214400,10,1506,4.472727272727273

So realistic, so utterly respectful, with such terrific performances across the board, I agree with a previous poster whose five-star review is the highest rated here: WHY WAS THIS MOVIE IGNORED? I never heard of it until the 2010 Oscar nominations were announced and Harrelson was nominated for best supporting actor.

My entire family watched this film together. I was extremely anxious for my two video-game-loving teenage boys to watch it, to give them a more realistic look at war's suffering and sacrifice than in their beloved ""Call of Duty.""

Warning: Parents, it's not rated R because of violence. It's rated R because of one graphic nude scene of sexual intercourse, one instance of full frontal female nudity after another sexual encounter, and one scene of sex sounds heard from the next room. I was embarrassed in front of my teenagers but it was worth it. And I didn't like the sex scenes but it did immediately tell you a lot about Harrelson's character, and dispel any notion you might have going in that this was going to be a ""warm and fuzzy"" movie.

Samantha Morton's performance was recognized by a few. This is a riveting account of some guys who are given an unpleasant job, notifying families of the death of a family member. Woody and Ben go about their rounds, and it's often hard to watch, and so well presented. It's a part of life, and life's not always pretty.

4078451,5,B0036RPM98,"This movie is magnificent! From my perspective of being a military veteran and a VA service provider for wounded soldiers...i was spellbound by the realism, repressed emotion, and successful delivery of the message. Ben Foster is superb (Oscar nominee?) in portraying a confused, angry, frustrated soldier whose repressed guilt and shame manifest in private glimpses of his hidden PTSD symptoms. His newly assigned mission in the Casualty Notification Team is taken initially as one of the worst assignments a soldier could get, notifying ""Next of Kin"" that a soldier has been captured or killed. Even harder still is working for Captain Stone (Harrelson), an obnoxious, loud spoken, blowhard, whom SSGT Montgomery (Ben Foster) despises. This path, for SSGT Montgomery, a wounded Iraq (reluctant) war hero, takes him from extreme rejection of a horrid job... to that of profound compassion for the most honorable duty. The ""messengers"" of tragedy and loss carry out their visits and encounter a wide range of human reactions. These notification visits, accompanied by the untold backgrounds of involved families, are marvelously played out by main and supporting cast.

A huge part of SSGT Montgomery's journey is the unlikely bonding with his bombastic CNO supervisor, Captain Stone---played flawlessly by Woody Harrelson. My vote is the Oscar for Supporting Actor (Harrelson) in this movie! Captain Stone has his own demons and time and circumstance yield trust, friendship and mutual sharing, for these two very different soldiers. SSGT Montgomery and Captain Stone's bonding creates a tremendous sense of understanding and unspoken allegiance. Samantha Morton is outstanding in the role of an army wife and now single mother. She presents an inspiring show of dignity, whilst feeling simultaneous guilt and relief, over her husband's death in Iraq. This shared sense of shame brings a very tender, extremely touching connection (unethical, but unavoidable) between her and Foster's character. The movie is a winner...it is fantastic and REAL..a poignant portrayal of military life and the complex emotions of being a modern soldier and wounded warrior. Get the popcorn and settle in for one of the best movies of the year.",1275436800,2,2226,5.396551724137931
4078452,4,B0036RPM98,"You never know how you are going to be received, and knocking on the door of someone's home to tell them their son or daughter has been killed in the war is fraught with all kinds of danger. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have created a divide with all of us. We are split between the people who have been directly affected by the war and those who have not. Staff Sgt. Will Montgomery, played by Ben Foster is just home from Iraq with a medal for heroism.  His superior officer has given him a new job to round out his time and the Army calls the job ""bereavement notification.""  His new officer will be a captain named Tony Stone, played by Woody Harrelson.

There are many rules to this new job and communication of the right kind is topmost. You only talk to NOK (next of kin), you never touch the NOK, you deliver the message sometime between 7am and 10pm at night. You provide a set sentence, letting the loved ones know their soldier was killed within the last 24 hours. Someone from the army will be in touch soon to assist. Is there someone we can call for you? You can imagine the responses are mixed, always sorrow and often hysteria. Many do not thank you, but most do. You are the bearer of horrible news. This takes its toll, and the two men drink or not, carouse, and at times talk. Communication is the name of the game. Both men have been through a great deal and have friends and lovers by the wayside.

Very few of us understand what our soldiers have been through and there are several examples shown throughout the film. They have become a part of a very select part of society, and most of us will never enter that ring. I finished reading Sebastian Junger's book 'The War' a few days ago. Junger was embedded with an infantry platoon in Afghanistan. He tells the stories of the men and of the War. It is harrowing and exhilarating, and I recommend this book to all. Now, here I am at the other end of the schism.  Someone has died, and most often traumatically. Families must be told. One helluva job.

4078453,4,B0036RPM98,This is one of the best dramas I have watched. No one wants to have a people of its own family in a war. But this movie shows you the complete stupidity of it. Great performances and excellent video quality. The movie just could be around 90 minutes to be perfect.,1274918400,,264,4.196078431372549
4078454,4,B0036RPM98,"4.2 stars

With a subject as emotionally loaded as this, it feels like the filmmakers almost just need to stay out of the way and let the inherent intensity come through. And when that's done here, the movie is excellent. Harrelson and Foster are both very good, and their relationship builds well; the last twenty minutes here are outstanding in many ways.

But there are a few rather disjointed moments on the way there, which is unfortunate, as what's good here is very good. Foster's budding semi-romance, which is touted in the ads and on the blu-ray box, is tertiary to the story at best, it seemed, and never began to touch me in the way that some of the other scenes did. But I guess there's always got to be a love interest to get Hollywood to make a movie.

It would have been nice if the film just focused on the terrible nature of the job, on both sides of the message. Those are the moments with serious power here and they are done well. If that and the two leads' bond were explored more in depth, I think this would have been one of the best movies I've seen in years. It's still very good, but I felt like it could have been even better. All the actors are solid, and the direction is good, but the script wanders here and there when it might have been more pointed and powerful.

That's brought home strongly by the short documentary included on the blu-ray, called Notification. As good as this movie is, that doc hit me far harder. It's worth getting this disc for by itself; together with the movie, it's a very fine package. The BD transfer is excellent, btw, very crisp and clear.

All in all, The Messenger is well worth watching, and its own various quiet messages are worth considering. It even fits in some subtle shots at the fact that perhaps there would be no need for any messengers at all if we'd keep out of the rest of the world's business. There are no doubt many childless parents out there who would be glad to get a chance to talk about that on film, but it seems unlikely we'll be seeing that movie any time soon. Nonethless, the scene here in the shopping mall is excellent, as is the perfect bit where Foster explains how he's no hero. Those two scenes add a much deeper resonance to this film, and let's face it: how can you talk about this subject without addressing the question of what these soldiers are dying for? Those two scenes are perhaps the touchstones of The Messenger, and meant to be pondered long after the film is over.

And I almost forgot Woody's great little speech about how every soldier's funeral should be on tv. What a great idea, but of course, as with our not being allowed to even see coffins coming home from Iraq, we can't have people thinking too much about all that. At least this film is here to encourage Americans to consider the real cost of war to so many mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and children. It says everything about who controls what that the Hurt Locker won Best Picture while The Messneger was almost forgotten at the last Oscars. This is a much better movie, but its message is not exactly one that will make the Pentagon's budget bigger.

Make sure to watch the documentary here; it's something very special. The Messenger is good, but Notification is even better.",1274745600,,3260,4.459731543624161
4078455,5,B0036RPM98,"I'm normally pretty hesitant about watching movies that have to do with war, but I'm glad that I chose to watch The Messenger. The movie took a completely different stance than what I'm used to when watching a movie about war. I never really thought about the people that had to deliver the message about a loved one that died in the military, and the way the story is told made me really care for the characters and feel for Harrelson's and Foster's characters and the important job that they have to perform. I would never want to have to do their job, but I truly respect the people that have to perform that job on a daily basis.

Harrelson, Foster and Samantha Morton put on really powerful performances that I honestly believed. And the rest of the cast did a fine job, as well. The emotion was so intense that I could feel it,  and I easily got sucked into the story. It was a powerful movie that really made me think about the hardships in a sincere and thoughtful way. Overall, I enjoyed the film and I will continue  recommending it to all my friends because I think everybody should watch it at least once.

4078456,5,B0036RPM98,"THE MESSENGER, even from the 'impersonal' title choice, places the complete picture of the emotional devastation that wars create.  The horrors and psychological destruction that occur on the battlefield and in the trenches awaiting encounter are only one aspect of the insanity of war. The afterburn - the effects on returning soldiers permanently damaged by the experience as well as the effects on families and loved ones who have wither been completely killed in action or simply damaged at time beyond repair - is the subject of this powerful film THE MESSENGER written (with Alessandro Camon) and directed by Oren Moverman. It follows the lives and post engagement assignments of two men fulfilling their obligations to the government by taking the roles of notifying the next of kin at the earliest possible hour after the death of a soldier is verified.

The 'all business' Col. Stuart Dorsett (a powerful portrayal by Eamonn Walker) in forms the newly returned home Staff Sargeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster, in one of his most sensitive roles of his career) that despite his physical traumas he is nursing he has been assigned a Casualty Notification Officer and will be taught the ropes by ex-alcoholic Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harelson, a finely nuanced and controlled performance).  The two bond, share past experiences (Will has just been ditched by his girl Kelly - Jena Malone, etc) and begin the learning process of notifying the next of kin.  What follows is the spectrum of anguish and crushing agony played by actors Steve Buscemi, Yaya DaCosta, Portia, Lisa Joyce, et al and the effect of the encounters is blisteringly brutal.  The Will and Tony deliver the news to on Olivia Pitterson (Samantha Morton) whose failing marriage to her now deceased husband makes her reception of the news outlined with dignity.  This incident makes a deep impression on Will and a relationship develops between these two needy people, one that is completely forbidden by military code.  How Will and Tony deal with this miserable job and how it affects both of them is the run of the film.

The film is tough to watch, so gut-wrenching is the subject matter, yet director Oren Moverman guides the film with restraint, ably assisted by the actors whose performances are all of outstanding quality, and this 'quiet' manner in which he unravels this story makes it just that much more tough to digest.  If more people would watch this film hopefully there would be more attention paid to the madness of war.  It is an important lesson, perfectly delivered.

4078457,5,B0036RPM98,"Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery, just back from Iraq, is a decorated war hero, wounded, with only three months left.  He gets assigned to deliver death notifications, under the supervision of Captain Tony Stone, a man hardened by what he has (and hasn't) seen.  When Will begins to fall for a woman whose husband has just died, he becomes a conflicted man, with his loyalties shifting between morality, the Army, and the urges of his own heart.

THE MESSENGER is a beautiful film.  The two lead performances are outstanding; Ben Foster has proven again and again that he is one of the best actors on the scene right now, even in films as ho-hum as the third X-MEN and PANDORUM.  It's nice to see him in a good film again, a film that's up to the standards of his talent.  Alongside him is Woody Harrelson, an actor finding a well-deserved resurgence lately (from blockbusters such as 2012 to indie flicks like DEFENDOR).  Harrelson and Foster carry the film; they're working with a marvelous script, and some superb direction, but this is their film through-and-through.  They command every scene, as their characters get to know each other, and come to a greater understanding of what it means to be human.  Surrounding them are a stellar bunch of supporting actors (most notably Samantha Morton as Will's new flame, and Steve Buscemi as a bereaved and violent father).  Even the minor roles are filled with fine actors; certain scenes are genuinely gut-wrenching.  This film is, at times, an uncomfortable viewing experience.

I suppose, on some level, THE MESSENGER is an anti-war film.  But it doesn't have an agenda.  It has a heart; it has a sense of humanity.  It is about two men doing one of the worst jobs imaginable, and how they cope in their respective ways.  This isn't a film for everyone; it's slow-burning and rather ambiguous.  If heart-wrenching, intelligent dramas aren't your thing, pass this one by.  However, if you appreciate films that are deep and powerful, anchored in reality, then you could do far worse than THE MESSENGER.  (Also, the DVD/Blu-ray features a documentary about actual members of the Casualty Notification Team, which is almost as interesting as the movie itself.)",1274486400,,2207,4.900269541778976
4078458,5,B0036RPM98,"I won't repeat what most of the reviewers have written except to underline the fact that this film was very moving. Telling loved ones their spouse, child, sibling or sweetheart has been killed in combat has to be the hardest task outside of actual combat. Personally, I'd rather take my chances with combat.

Something that added to the realism of the film, of course, is the reaction of the bereaved families. What is not widely known is that neither Harrelson or Foster knew what the reactions of the families would be. This put them in the same position as actual military ""messengers"" when they encounter families of the fallen soldiers/sailors/airmen/Marines. No script, just raw emotional responses. I've never seen Woody Harrelson better.

I have a son currently in Afghanistan (for the third time) and I felt tugging at my heart every time they walked up to a door. While the ""Hurt Locker"" was a great film, its' emotional impact paled by comparison with ""The Messenger"".",1274054400,2,980,4.933333333333334
4078459,5,B0036RPM98,"If you saw Black Hawk Down and The Hurt Locker you might have gotten an idea of modern warfare - what the Soldiers are going through on a daily basis. Although Hollywood made, these films do not glorify the violence or the people; they just get you there.
Of course watching a movie - that is any movie - is nothing close to the real thing. But at least some films try to transmit an accurate picture of the situation, including the angst, shock, anger, and demonstrate the professionalism that so often is the Soldiers' only way out.

This one takes the war home, into the living rooms of the family members, lovers and children of the men and women who will never return.
No guns or battles, just pain and shock - but just as dramatic as the two previously mentioned. And just like them it shows us a part of the war most of us don't know anything about. Magazine articles, TV news and what not - nothing comes close to the scenes we're shown here where families are destroyed and lives forever changed.
I feel we need to watch this, each and every one of us, so we better understand the next time we talk about war.

Without the Army's framework, Woody Harrelson's character would probably have ended up on the wrong side of the road. Married three times, AA, frustrated about having missed out on the real battle experience, it's his job to deliver the horrible message. He get's Ben Foster put to his side as a partner. A War-hero with his own demons to fight.
Sure, this is a fictional tale, with the characters' personalities adding to the drama. But with the excellent camera work and the fabulous script the story hits home from the first scene on.
And when you think it's boring to watch these men deliver their message over and over again - think again. These two actors - and the others - are perfectly cast with each of them delivering award worthy performances of the highest order.

The Blu-ray comes packed in a plastic-free box and includes the dvd version on a separate disc. Another plus: the disc loads and there are no disturbing commercials or other previews messing with the experience. Press play and the film ""rolls"".
The picture is crisp and very detailed. A few night scenes lack depth in the blacks (didn't disturb me much) but all in all it's a great disc.",1273968000,4,2285,4.501204819277109
4078460,5,B0036RPM98,"Well, it took long enough. Someone has finally made a film that gets the harrowing national nightmare of the Iraq/Afghanistan wars right. Infused with sharp writing, smart and unobtrusive direction and compelling performances, ""The Messenger"" is one of those insightful observations of the human condition that quietly sneaks up and really gets inside you, staying with you long after the credits roll. First-time director Owen Moverman and co-writer Alessandro Camon not only bring the war(s) home, but they then proceed to march up your driveway and deposit in on your doorstep. Quite literally.

Knock, knock.

""The Secretary of the Army has asked me to express his deep regret that your (son, daughter, husband, wife) (died/was killed in action) in (country/state) on (date). The Secretary extends his deepest sympathy to you and your family in your tragic loss.""

Those are words that no one ever wants to hear, and I can't imagine any job in the world that could possibly be any worse than being the person assigned to deliver that message. ""There's no such thing as a satisfied customer,"" deadpans Casualty Notification Officer Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) to his new apprentice, Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster), who is emotionally shattered by his virgin encounter with bereaved ""NOK"".

Sgt. Montgomery is a decorated, recently returned Iraq War vet whose enlistment is almost up. Although he accepts this one last thankless assignment with the stoic obedience expected from a professional soldier, he appears to privately suffer from PTSD; a condition that makes an odd bedfellow with his new responsibilities.  Stone is a hardass, a cynical careerist who carries a fair share of personal baggage himself. When he bluntly asks Montgomery if he is ""a head case"" right after meeting him, you suspect that this may be a case of ""it takes one to know one"". Stone (and Harrelson's portrayal) is reminiscent of SM1 Buddusky, Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Last Detail"".

In fact, there is a lot about this film that reminds me of those episodic, naturalistic character studies that directors like Hal Ashby and Bob Rafaelson used to turn out back in the 70s; giving their actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters in a very real and believable manner. A subplot involving a relationship between Montgomery and a recently widowed Army wife (Samantha Morton) strongly recalled one of my all-time favorite sleepers from that particular era and style of filmmaking, Mark Rydell's ""Cinderella Liberty"" (worth seeking out, if you have never seen it, BTW).

Although the filmmakers hold back from making any overt political statements, the notification scenes in the film say it all-we continue to ship scores of young American men and women overseas whole of limb and spirit, and return many of them home sans either or both (or in a box)...and for what justifiable reason, exactly? And as heartbreaking, gut-wrenching and hard to watch as these scenes are-I am sure they pale in comparison to the agony of those families and loved ones who have answered the door and received that news for real. I would challenge anyone who feels we ""need"" to dig ourselves in deeper into our present Middle East quagmire(s) to watch this film, reassess the justifications, and get back to me. Go. I'll wait.",1268697600,5,3326,5.091743119266055
4078461,5,B0036RPM98,"The Messenger is the story of Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery, played by Ben Foster, a wounded soldier who has returned to the base and is placed on the notification team until the time of his discharge. Colonol Dorsett, played by Woody Harrelson in his best performance to date, shows him the ropes. The two are an unlikely duo, and despite both being combat veterans (Dorsett in Desert Storm), this assignment provides a very different stress. The two soldiers are on call every hour of every day. When a soldier dies, they race to notify the family before they hear about their love one's death somewhere else. Given their unique jobs, they spend more and more of their time together even when they're not working.

The extended supporting cast members of this film are amazing. Their notifications are met with a variety of results, as we all process grief and shock differently. The supporting actors and actresses have one scene to deliver their messages of despair and grief. The film is a fascinating look into the human psyche, and it's the best war movie I've ever seen. It's a deep, thoughtful, uncomfortable look at the effects of war on individuals. Woody Harrelson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but I'm surprised Samantha Morton was not nominated for Best Supporting Actress.

The Messenger is not always an easy film to watch, but it's well worth the time. It's not a movie I want to watch over and over again, but it a film I will buy and watch once every year or two. Mostly, I'll pass along my dvd to anyone who will watch it. Everyone has jumped on The Hurt Locker bandwagon, but The Messenger is a better film. It's smarter, more nuanced and a more fascinating look at this war. I was surprised when it wasn't nominated for the Best Picture Oscar.

Ben Foster plays Will Montgomery, an injured soldier, hardened by war, forced to work alongside a Gulf War Vet. Together they travel through New Jersey informing family members that their son, daughter, husband or wife has died in combat. Montgomery fights this position that requires such human contact, but soon finds kinship with a young mother whose soldier husband has just died. Moverman echoes back to the films of Hal Ashby and Robert Altman in several sequences, using long takes and a constantly probing camera lens. Ben Foster, Woody Harrelson and Samantha Morton all give very strong performances in their respected roles. The weakness, if the only one, comes in Jena Malone's performance. Her development is weak and, worse of all, she never fully commits to the words or moments being experienced by her character. This drags the pacing of the story, but only for the few scenes that include her. Her character requires very little screen time, but this only further pushes the need for a stronger development, yet she fails. However, Foster, Harrelson, Morton and Moverman all succeed in accomplishing something truly honest and sincere in every moment the audience gets to experience with them.

8390157,1,B0036RPM98,"What an awful movie.  It felt like three hours long and painful.  The very first scene of the movie is a sex scene.  From there, it was just a steady stream of painfully drawn out trash.  I watched this because we loved the movie ""Taking Chance"".  Do your self a favor and don't make the same mistake.  I had to watch ""Taking Chance"" again after this to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",1508457600,,388,4.1066666666666665
8390158,5,B0036RPM98,This is an excellent movie on many levels. Acting/subject/writing. It is about two soldiers who are damaged in different ways and coming to grips with how life is now. One is a returning soldier with wounds and the other who never had to go overseas but has to notify families of deceased sons/daughters and the wounded soldier is assigned to duty with him.......,1506211200,,363,4.777777777777778
8390159,5,B0036RPM98,"There are few reviews out there about this movie, but the ones I've seen/read are all right.
This is a great movie and is without a doubt worth ever second used.",1505260800,,161,4.225806451612903

8390161,5,B0036RPM98,This is a well acted film telling a story rarely heard about the people who report military deaths to survivors and the prices they pay to do so.  Ben Foster's deeply moving performance was intense and apparently heartfelt.,1497398400,,223,4.868421052631579
8390162,5,B0036RPM98,Great movie! Appreciated that it didn't sugar coat anything. Beautifully written and perfectly cast. 10/10 would recommend.,1496016000,,123,6.294117647058823
