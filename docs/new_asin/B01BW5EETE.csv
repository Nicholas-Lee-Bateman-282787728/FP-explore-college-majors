7669724,2,B01BW5EETE,"It is well documented and established that in the US, English-dubbed anime outsells non-dubbed by at least three or four times.  So why does Bandai continue to dump their old GUNDAM material on the US market without dubs (they did the same thing with the original MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM movies on DVD)?  The dubs clearly exist [they are available on VHS] so they are only shooting themselves in the foot by not releasing them.  How do they expect to attract a new (younger) audience by releasing them in a form that will not sell?  (My kids unfortunately won't watch anything in black & white or not dubbed).  Note that this short-sighted action is equivalent to releasing DVDs of old TV series and then stripping out all of the original music but without the excuse of ""not being able to release the music due to excessive royalty costs (examps- WKRP IN CINCINATTI, THE FUGITIVE, etc"".  People won't buy them because they ""are not what they remember seeing"".",1289347200,6,955,4.72289156626506
7669725,4,B01BW5EETE,"This movie trilogy is awesome, I saw it when it originally came out in 2005-06. Unfortunately since it was all Japanese with no subtitles I couldn't understand the whole thing (especially the new scenes). That being said, when it comes to anime, I prefer subtitles over poor quality dubbing. Something just seems to be lost in the emotions conveyed by the characters when it comes to english dubs, especially when the english voices themselves are generic and emotionless. Instead of complaining, just be happy it's finally released here in the U.S. 5 years later after the original release. If it bothers you that much, don't watch it.",1288915200,5,636,4.953271028037383
7669726,5,B01BW5EETE,"After watching these movies in their entirity I can say they are incredibly enjoyable. While a little disjointed due to the need for some considerable editing to fit the movie format, those who have viewed the Zeta series will have no issue with following the story. The added new animation is simply superb. And the matted subtitles are easy enough to follow. Now, this series was not created for an English speaking audience, funnily enough it was made for Japan. While I too would have loved an English dub, Bandai have at least provided us with an opportunity to view with subs. Now this gets my goat, there are reviewers who criticise the Japanese 'dub'. There is no Japanese dub, it is the original soundtrack, created for their own market. To profer reviews at a lower rating due to this takes away from the value of the films themselves. Hell, you don't see a bunch of idiots giving Pan's Labyrinth the thumbs down because there's no cheesey English 'dub' on that. Zeta is easily one of the better entries in the Gundam canon, but I guess we all have different priorities when watching.",1283904000,16,1094,4.6735751295336785
7669727,3,B01BW5EETE,"Each DVD in this package is a therater release of a reproduction of Z Gundam's 50 episodes. It use some of the old scene from the TV episodes and mixed with new CG scene. The only thing that annoys me is the Japanese dub. I was hoping that it has the English sub title. Also, the old closing music theme is being replaced.",1280016000,3,322,4.126984126984127
7669728,3,B01BW5EETE,"If you are considering purchasing this compilation, chances are you have already seen the Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam TV series. And if you haven't I suggest you watch the original Mobile Suit Gundam (1979) so that you may have a better foundation for the forthcoming story...but I digress. Zeta Gundam take places seven years after the ""One Year War"". In order to combat the splinters of what was once the mighty Principality of Zeon; the Earth Federation establishes an elite force known as the ""Titans"". The Titans soon obtain vast influence and develop tyrannical characteristics, eventually fixing their sights on controlling the entire Earth Sphere. Two resistance groups emerge know as the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) and Karaba. Kamille Bidan, the main protagonist of the series, is a colonist on Green Noa 1 when it is attacked by a reconnaissance party of the AEUG looking for Titan's advanced Gundam prototypes. Out of resentment for the Titans, Kamille finds himself stealing a Mark-II prototype for the AEUG and eventually joins them in their quest to destroy the Titans.

This new iteration complies the 50-episode story into a film trilogy; ""Heirs to the Stars"", ""Lovers"", and ""Love Is the Pulse of the Stars"" respectively. Yoshiyuki Tomino, the director and writer of original wanted the movies to not only celebrate the show's 20th Anniversary but to also introduce the series to the influx of newer viewers from Gundam SEED. A large portion of the series was digitally re-mastered, putting the trilogy's visuals (IMO) more on par with Gundam UNICORN, but with distinct stylistic differences reminiscent of the Zeta Gundam series. Some of the storyline; which I won't spoil, has also been changed, most notably the ending. This aspect is lover or hate and I doubt it will have any bearing on newcomers. However there is a major deterrent in this trilogy for me--it is a Japanese dub with English subtitles (somewhat ironic considering its subtitle is ""A New Translation""). I am a devout Gundam fan which is why the announcement of this trilogy was so exciting. However, as you would imagine, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment after discovering this fact. Some might argue that a Japanese dub adds to the authenticity of the movies but I for one couldn't care less when reading subtitles distract from enjoying the visuals and being immersed in the experience. Thus I do not understand what Bandai was thinking if they were under the impression that a Japanese dub would sell well in North America. Who knows, maybe it will sell well and I am in the minority, but the lack of an English dub is why I cannot give this movie trilogy the rating it deserves. However, for those of you who did enjoy the Japanese dub from the original, the majority of the Japanese cast have reprised their roles except for some female characters such as Fa Yuriy and Four Murasame.

Over all, if you are a Gundam fan, Zeta Gundam fan, or Mecha fan, or all three, you will enjoy this movie trilogy, that is if you can get past the Japanese dub.",1278806400,18,3049,4.872832369942197

7669730,2,B01BW5EETE,"This seems like a good idea - condensing the series down to essentialized movies with some added material. But these shows are *really* complicated - lots of characters, lots of plot nuance, lots of time spent developing motivations. Whether you think it's a soap opera or good writing - either way, most of what makes the show really engrossing is lost in sifting it down. I've seen the whole thing and still I had a hard time following these - remembering why characters did what they did, etc. It might be fun for some people as a reminder of the original, but I couldn't get into it. There is just too much missing.",1398297600,5,619,4.486725663716814

7669733,5,B01BW5EETE,I big original gundam fan and i wanted to watch the new trilogy with the new animation. Liked how the changed and highlighted the best parts of the already amazing zeta series. Only thing that got to me was they omitted possibly the best speech in all anime by Char but that may be a personal sentiment otherwise it was awesome and highly recommended,1367366400,,350,4.484375
7669734,3,B01BW5EETE,There is a lot of story and events from the original Zeta series to ram into a three movie trilogy.  I can't say that was done well in this series.  I was totally lost in the first movie.  Its important that you either read the story in advance before you watch the movie or invest the hours into watching the original series.  The new animation is quite nice.  The first movie is almost all put together with original footage but the last two videos are mostly new animation.  Not having the English dub is quite annoying.  You practically miss all the new animation because there is so much text to read and you need to keep up with it or get lost with the story.,1311984000,2,665,4.272
7669735,3,B01BW5EETE,"If you've already seen the original Zeta Gundam series and liked it, please press ""add to cart"" and skip this review. If you haven't, read on...

First off, I am not new to Gundam. I've watched all of Mobile Suit Gundam, Char's Counterattack, War in the Pocket, 08th MS Team, Stardust Memory, Gundam Wing, Endless Waltz, 00, X, Turn A, Igloo and Unicorn.  Every other series (except Zeta, Double Zeta, F91 and Victory) I watched enough episodes to determine I wasn't interested.

I wanted to experience Zeta Gundam, and I chose to go with the movie compilation over the original TV series because I no longer have the time to dedicate to a 50-episode series. I'm not sure that this was the right decision. I'll get straight to the point: It was all kinds of confusing.

Trying to boil down 21-22 hours of TV series into a 5 hour movie trilogy just doesn't work that well, even when a lot of the original scenes are re-done. The problem is that, while you can easily read a summary or watch a recap, trying to watch massively cut scenes that are presented as a coherent story is stupendously taxing on the brain.  Even if you know where you came from while watching a scene in the Zeta movies, you're not likely to be given even the briefest moment of reflection before you're suddenly in a totally different location and a new plot point is shoved into your face, accompanied by dramatic music saying, ""Stop thinking, pay attention to THIS scene!""

Of course, trouble keeping up with the plot can be solved by hitting the pause button or pressing back for the previous scene. The director made sure that the main plot is all there. What can't be fixed, however, is the brutally truncated human story and character development.  If you are like I was and haven't seen Gundam Zeta, you will be frequently wondering things like ""Who is this person?"", ""Why are those two pissed at each other?"" and ""What happened to so-and-so?""

The end result is that I now know what happened, I know who the important people are, I enjoyed sopping up the Zeta suits/tech, and I was impressed by the new animation (especially the well executed battles). But watching this trilogy was strenuous and ultimately left me feeling nothing for the characters other than ""Oh. So that's how it ended."" Not a very fulfilling experience.

So, if you haven't seen the original Zeta series, or ESPECIALLY if you aren't familiar with Gundam, I highly recommend you don't watch this yet. If you *have* seen Zeta, buy it now. I'm positive you will be blown away by the new animation.",1308960000,16,2547,4.642222222222222
7669736,4,B01BW5EETE,"For those who don't know, the original Zeta Gundam tv series was released back in 1985, as a sequel to Yoshiyuki Tomino's original, groundbreaking Mobile Suit Gundam series.

Considered a favorite among 80s mecha and gundam fans for it's complex politically driven plots, great characters and cool mobile suit/mecha designs which are still considered cool looking and iconic even 20 years later, Zeta Gundam was my first introduction to the gundam franchise and still one of the favorite series.  Once again exposing characters to the horrors and brutality of war, unlike the original MSG, this series turns the original on its head by making the Earth Federation the villains with their brutal police force, the Titans, and the rebels, including former MSG villain Char Aznable, known as the AEUG, as the heroes.  This 50 ep series climaxes in a final battle that costs all the characters far more than anyone expected.

In 2005-6, Tomino decided to give Zeta Gundam the original MSG film treatment by creating a new trilogy of films based on the sequel with a big difference.  While the movies used the original story and some of the original TV footage, some of it was replaced with all new updated animated sequences and new scenes with dialogue rerecorded by the original voice cast (whenever possible).  As a result you get a somewhat disjointed visual look when the films switch from older footage to newer, but all in all they are still good compilations.

The first film uses about 40% newly animated footage and by the third movie its closer to 70% new footage.  I assume for production reasons they didn't reanimated the entire films from scratch, but still it would have been nice knowing that they could.

Animation and visuals aside, there are some cool new OP and ED credit themes performed by jrock fan favorite singer Gackt, who, unbeknownst to many, despite his rock star status, is actually a pretty hard core gundam fan and allowed his inner geek to come thru by performing music for the movies, and they actually work pretty well.  The majority of the film score still retain the original symphonic soundtrack of the original TV series, which is well done even by today's standards.

Now here is where some fans of the original TV series may take issue.  The loss of many key parts of the story can be considered unavoidable when you try to condense 30 hrs of story into 6, but certain scenes that were critical to the Zeta Gundam storyline were omitted from the movies (like Char's speech at Dakar) and others were radically altered (like the ending).  Also character development is changed in someone because of the altered sequence of events.  Still these movies are great to watch, if possible, watch both the TV and movies and decide for yourself which ones you like more.",1298160000,6,2798,4.838574423480084
7669737,5,B01BW5EETE,I liked this better than the television version of Zeta and recommend it for anyone that hated the television show ending.,1293840000,,122,4.857142857142857

8751704,2,B01BW5EETE,"I can't really recommend this release. This is not to say that Zeta isn't good, Zeta is very good, but this take on it is really problematic. As you have likely read, this movie series condenses the 50 episodes of the original series own into three 2-hour movies. However, they changed parts of the narrative to accommodate this massive compression, so they reanimated a number of the scenes. They also changed the ending. So with that we'll move to the pros first:

+ The new art is beautiful: The scenes with new artwork look great. The 2006 animation is framed well and animated wonderfully. It really is a shame they didn't just reanimate the whole thing, because for the third movie as much as 70% of it is new animation.

On to the major cons:
- The original series is about 17 hours long. Going from 17 hours to less than 6 hours, you're losing about 2/3 of the series into the movies, while trying to cover the game ground. Because of this, the pacing is so breakneck it's hard to keep up with who's who and what's going on. Even significant details like where the Zeta Gundam came from are omitted from the movies. The result is that the movies are hard to follow.
- The flip-flopping of the art styles is VERY distracting. Even in the middle of a scene, it will flip from the classic 1985/1986 animation to the modern 2006 animation. Two characters can be having a conversation and when you're seeing one you're seeing the 80s style, and when you see the other you're seeing the 2006 style. It completely takes you out of the moment and makes it even harder to follow these already difficult to follow films.
- When are ARE seeing the 80s style animation, they committed the cardinal sin of zooming the 4:3 original cells to fit the 16:9 format of modern televisions. So instead of seeing the charming original art the way it was drawn, it's far too close to the ""camera"" and pans up and down when details or off screen. It looks terrible enough as it is, but then when it flips back and forth from the properly framed new animation, it just looks horrid.
- They changed the ending.

In short, just watch the original series. It's much, much better than these compilation movies. The only way I could recommend these to anyone is if you've already seen all of the original series and want to check out the new art.",1530748800,3,2324,4.476415094339623
8751705,5,B01BW5EETE,Excellent,1526688000,,9,9.0
8751706,5,B01BW5EETE,"Overall it was a nice edition, the one thing I didn't like was that it wasn't in English",1518652800,,88,3.9444444444444446
8751707,3,B01BW5EETE,"In the mid 2000's when I first heard this compilation was being made I was excited. I had only been able to view the series with iffy fansubs at that point and was happy to hear a movie trilogy version was coming that shortened things up. After all the original Gundam trilogy is exceptional with many people even preferring it to the original series due to its lack of filler and its retconning of several silly aspects of the 1979 anime.

However while the original Gundam show had quite a bit that was able to be left out and re-worked, Zeta Gundam was not quite as compromised by its marketing and budget and thus it's a lot more difficult to compress. I'm not saying Zeta Gundam is the best paced show in the world, I think it could easily be reduced to 25-30 episodes instead of its original 50 episode run without losing much due to having so many repetitive battle scenes and some unnecessary plots in the middle of the series, but 3 movies is not enough to the complex plot that's stuffed with major and minor characters justice.

The end result is many characters having unclear or sometimes completely unstated motivations as well as very awkward developments that were handled better in the show. Kamille Bidan, the protagonist often feels like side character given how his development from hot-headed teenager to mature newtype is barely handled or shown on screen. Several other events just happen without explanation such as new major character mobile suits just appearing with little fanfare like the Hyaku Shiki. The titular Zeta Gundam itself shows up with no explanation of how it was developed (something pretty integral to Kamille in the show) nor is it ever explained why it has such special abilities in the final film. Other important plot elements regarding the political situation, including one iconic scene involving Quattro, don't make into the movies causing the main conflict of the story to play out in a chaotic and confusing manner, jumping from one battle to the next often with very little context.

If you are a fan of the original show and have already seen it in its entirety then you can fill in the gaps and enjoy the ride. Seeing some of battles in modernized animation is a real treat for Zeta fans even if the animation cutting back and forth between new and old is often extremely jarring and it probably would have been for the best if they had instead re-animated the entire thing. This is most noticeable in the first film and gets better at things move along.

There are several story changes, some interesting and some kind of pointless, most in the service of patching up a few of the plot holes that were created when condensing a 50 episode series into three hour and a half films, though there perhaps isn't enough of these to really make the package work as a standalone product. The ending is the most drastic change that is somewhat controversial as it retcons the events of the sequel series ZZ Gundam.

So to reiterate if you are already a fan of Zeta Gundam and just want to watch these films out of curiosity or because you want a refresher without sitting through the lengthy and at times slow-moving series again, ""A New Translation"" is worth having. The new animation alone makes it worth it. If you have not seen Zeta Gundam yet then I recommend you watch the series instead, even if you have to skim through some of the middle-episodes you'll have a much more satisfying experience. If you're new to Gundam entirely this is a very, very bad place to start and I recommend checking out the original movie trilogy instead.",1514332800,,3586,4.667721518987341
8751708,3,B01BW5EETE,"I'm a big UC Gundam fan and especially of Zeta.  I feel like most people reading this have already seen the series before so I won't go into details on the actual story.  Only advised if you've already seen the full series and want either a refresher on it or a new take on the story.  The new animation is great but very difficult to adjust to when it keeps switching between old and new footage (the last of the 3 films being the best about minimizing this).  Most people know of this choice already and it is what it is.

As for the blu-ray quality, the sound is excellent.  Japanese with English subs only but it sounds wonderful.  The picture quality is excellent and what you would expect of a blu-ray release in 2017, EXCEPT there is a significant amount of noise on the picture.  Like, you can see black dots dancing all around in Char's blond hair.  While this is expected in the older footage (although it wasn't anywhere near this bad in the First Gundam movie releases) it is almost worse in the new footage and definitely distracting.  If you crank your noise reduction up on your TV you can make it a bit less noticeable but you should not have to do that for a new release.  Kind of a bummer.

Overall, I'm glad this got a US release on Blu-Ray but, as a videophile, it's unfortunate that the noise is so strong.  Worth picking up for the different take on the story but only advised for big Zeta fans who want a physical release of it.",1505692800,2,1451,4.3099630996309966

While some detest it, it's not as jarring as some would have you believe and you start to get used to it after a bit.

You get 3 discs that include Heir To the Stars, Lovers, and Love Is the Pulse of the Stars. These compilations are fast-paced but done well and look amazing. The changes to the story are nice and work well but aren't exactly canon as it basically makes ZZ Gundam no longer exist.

For the Mobile Suit fans, keep an eye out for some captured GM Cannon IIs and GM Customs from Gundam 0083 as well as a glimpse at the Titans' Gundam TR-1 'Advanced' Hazel! There's also a quick glimpse at a Gaza-E as well!",1465603200,10,860,4.302469135802469

1. No English dub as said on the product details. The sub is fine however and there a minor audio enhancements.
2. The movies flip between old and new footage. This can take some adjusting to. With the amount reanimated, it makes me wonder why they didn't go ahead and reanimate the whole set of movies? Probably an aesthetic plug. . .
3. Die hard fans will be disappointed by the lack of original introductions from the TV series.

The Good:
1. Reanimated portions look crisp and up to date. This adds to the experience.
2. Quick. If you want to revisit the series without a 50 episode plunge, this is your best bet. It runs just over 5 hours total.

I think this is a must for a collection and a maybe to pass for someone interested in getting into the Gundam Universe. For newcomers, I'd recommend other series (like Wing, Unicorn, or even Seed or 00) before going into this.",1462320000,4,887,4.402439024390244
