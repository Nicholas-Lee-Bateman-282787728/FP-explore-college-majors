8502641,4,B006P5QFJO,This review is for the 4-movie DVD that comes with 2 movies on each of 2 discs.  Don't expect Award-winning performances or plots.  These movies are targeted for families with younger kids.  For that they are good.  A little silly yes but aren't all kid shows?  It was fun watching them with my kids.,1402185600,,300,4.481481481481482
