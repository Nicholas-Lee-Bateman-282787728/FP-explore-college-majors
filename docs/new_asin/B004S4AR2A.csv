8439473,5,B004S4AR2A,"Besides having to watch Mr. Mehta run around in a dress this was outstanding.  What makes it so is the music, and for the most part the production does not distract from it.  I found Ms. Schafer intensely interesting to listen to and watch.  Mr. Mehta was equally as good minus the dress.  I can't stress enough the profound beauty of the music.",1418515200,,345,4.428571428571429
8439474,4,B004S4AR2A,"We have before us two celebrated versions of Handel's masterpiece oratorio 'Theodora' - the older Glyndebourne (mid-1990) directed by Peter Sellars and conducted by William Christie, and this 2009 Salzburg directed by Christoph Loy.
I do not pretend to say that I 'understand' Loy's direction, though.  Even if the production is minimalist, it is not 'concert-like'.  I do not even attempt to label this as a 'concert performance'.  Nay, as always with Loy, he has lots of dramatic 'direction' during the singing, be it by soloists or chorus.
Clever staging in the aspects of 'deployment', since the chorus has also plenty of things to 'act out', but they multiple 'actions' are not easy to decipher if you are not totally familiar with the libretto, as for instance, when in Act 1's beginning, Valens show much sexual interest in Theodora (which is quite unnecessary according to the libretto), and the actions between the two characters detract much from the plain meanings of the lyrics.  Such instances of dramatic detractions abound in Loy's direction, as a result of which the production is not easy viewing as with Sellars' Glyndebourne, where he works out a 'plot' that is not situational but more logical dramatically, and hence much more easy to follow.
So much for the staging that I do not particularly find attractive.  As for the music, I must say that this one is an out and out winner, despite Christie's tremendous direction at the pit in Glyndebourne and the great performances by Lorraine Hunt (as Irene) and David Daniels (as Didymus).
In the title role, we have perhaps the best sung Theodora in Christine Schafer, and by that I am comparing her not only with 21st century performances but also those date back to a quarter of the century. Schafer is a notoriously underrated singer.  Her timbre is unique - she can handle baroque (with limited vibrato), and Verdi (La Traviata).  You cannot 'brand' her voice type to soprano leggiero or full lyrical, and she is adept at lieder to the extent of top expertise.
So, this is a major soprano talent.  Her Theodora is utterly convincing.  Matching her, Bejun Mehta (in 2009) is is top vocal estate and almost surpassed David Daniels.  His duets with Theodora are amazing.
Joseph Kaiser as compared to Richard Croft does not gain much ground, but he is vocally more than competent.  The two bass singers for Valens are equal in vocal strength.
The chorus, I must say, is very effective in this Salzburg production.  The individual singers act and sing in full dramatic committment, yet never losing sight of the vocal coherence required for the daunting choral pieces.
Had I liked the staging a bit more, it would definitely be 5-star.",1401926400,5,2701,4.899122807017544
8439475,5,B004S4AR2A,"This stage version is completely successful as improbable as it sounds. Christof Loy as the director has faith in the audience and he treats us to a simple but painstakingly choreographed version. There is no revolving stage, no jaw-dropping light effects, no scene changes really. I admire Loy's restraint: his effort not to insert himself between the music and the listener. He lets the music itself speak. The contemporary political resonance of the work comes through crystal clear. Theodora is fundamentally a story of human beings struggling to act inside and beyond institutional power structures. This version illuminates the work's political content beautifully. Yes, it is very well sung too, but this is not a surprise given the venue.",1324598400,5,746,5.277310924369748
8439476,5,B004S4AR2A,"I like this modern staging of Theodora from the Salzburg Festival.  It is really well done, and while the scene never changes (a few chairs are moved, and that's pretty much it), it doesn't get boring at all, thanks to the excellent cast.  The staging might actually be considered rather conservative, apart from the modern dresses.  I feel that the director Christof Loy is trying to tell a simple story without adding distractions, so the focus is really on the music and the words.  All the main singers are also excellent actors and are able to make their characters' struggles seem believable.  I don't think there is anything ""creepy"" or ""repellant"" about the production, as another reviewer noted.  And just to explain the cover photo, which is perhaps not a wise choice by the production company: the plot requires Theodora and Didymus to exchange clothes in the dungeon to allow Theodora to escape, but the scene is miles away from an R-rating.  As for the set, there is a huge stage to fill in Salzburg, and here, a large organ dominates the scene (a performance of Haendel's g-minor organ concerto is added in the third act).

There is not a  weak link among the five main singers, and the music is amazing.  When in Act 2, after many arias, two voices finally join for a duet, the effect is absolutely stunning.  This duet (""To thee, thou glorious son of worth"") is an amazing piece of music, and Christine Schaefer and Bejun Mehta sing it beautifully.",1313452800,11,1464,4.701960784313726
8439477,5,B004S4AR2A,"Presented at the Salzburg Festival in 2009 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the composer's death, Theodora isn't a Handel opera, but rather a staged version of his 1750 oratorio.  It would however be more accurate to say that this is semi-staged, and perhaps even more accurate to say it's barely staged at all.  It doesn't take a lot of imagination, and it certainly doesn't place any demands on the costume or set designers, to scatter a few chairs about the stage and have the chorus and principal singers dress in the modern formal black evening-dress of a concert performance, unless there's some hidden significance in updating the martyrdom of Theodora and Didymus from Antioch in 3AD to a concert stage.  It's semi-staged in that rather than all face the audience, the singers move around a bit, remove the occasional item of clothing and put a little more acting into the singing.

As it turns out though, it doesn't matter in the slightest if it seems like the production team earned an easy paycheck for this one, because it works.  Theodora is not an oratorio that lends itself easily to a dramatic staging and attempts to do so (such as Peter Sellars' Glyndebourne production) can potentially detract from the true qualities of this remarkable work, so thankfully this version hasn't been messed around with at all.  The oratorio considers the fate of Theodora, a Christian woman who tries to hold her virtue from the assaults of the Roman governor Valens and refuses to worship Jupiter, who is eventually martyred along with a young Roman soldier Didymus who attempts to help her escape from the life of forced prostitution that is her punishment.  It's a religious work, made up of contemplative prayers that espouse virtue and chastity, but, along with the fate of Didymus, who loves Theodora in a pure fashion, there are other noble sentiments in the work that celebrate valour in the face of tyranny and martyrdom.

The music itself - really some of the most exquisite music Handel ever composed - expresses this perfectly and as evocatively as you could imagine.  The music is warmly rapturous, the singing heavenly and the choruses inspiringly uplifting.  The producers clearly recognise where the strengths of the piece are and give them centre stage, doing nothing in the dramatisation that could interfere with the singing performances.  Those performances are magnificent, the English diction perfect in every case, with Christine Schfer's Theodora exhibiting fragility turning into steely determination, Bejun Mehta a glorious countertenor Didymus, and Joseph Kaiser a fine, emotionally moved Septimus.  Ivor Bolton conducts the Freiburger Barockorchester with great sensitivity through a breathtaking performance.  This is a stunningly beautiful work, perfectly performed and very well presented in High Definition, with a terrifically detailed image and two fine audio tracks in LPCM Stereo and DTS HD Master Audio 5.1, where every element of the mix is crystal clear and perfectly balanced.",1306108800,20,3025,5.174180327868853
