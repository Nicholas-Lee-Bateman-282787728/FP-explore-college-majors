7276176,5,B00ZCOF0I6,"The only issue I had was that it was too short. I wish they could have made it longer. But as you will see, it's a scary movie considering all this man had to go up against, knowing what we know now. I feel as though he was goaded into doing this against Hitler, and then when he failed, as you will see, the man that did the goading offered him money to escape essentially. They could have made more of his plight afterwards, but I felt the power of the threats against him during his case were really explosive, not to mention Hitler's gaze and somewhat controlled hatred toward him....WOW. A very good movie though. Love the BBC.",1448236800,4,632,4.319327731092437
7276177,5,B00ZCOF0I6,"A very thought-provoking drama about a real-life situation several years before Hitler assumed full power.  Ed Stoppard is very good as the young lawyer Hans Litten, who actually had the courage to summon Hitler to appear in a trial of some of his ""Brownshirts"".",1447027200,6,262,4.954545454545454

7276179,5,B00ZCOF0I6,"Nazism today is thought  as the ultimate example of ""evil"". This film provides some insight into the reason why the German world embraced Nazism so fervently. The fundamental ideas this time are not clearly explained. However, the effect on the populace is presented vividly. The freicorps are mentioned, but not explained. The hatred of Jews is shown by direct verbal attack.

The reason for the hatred, the rejection of Christianity in previous centuries, the acceptance of Hegel and other German romanticists, the worship of 'volk' and the elevation of the Prussian State as the 'end of history' is not presented. (Freidrich Meinecke - the German Catastrophe) This is a real loss. Insofar as it avoids context, the film subtly persuades the viewer of the - mad, incoherent, incomprehensible, irrational - motives of the German populace at that time. This is incorrect. The true causes rest in worship of German idealism and enthusiastic devotion to Darwinism. (See Mark Lilla - ""The  Stillborn God: Religion, Politics and the Modern West"") Hitler understood this and used preconceived ideas for his own ends.

The film starts with a murderous attack on a small communist group in a cafe. The reason the nazis did it is never explained. Again, implying madness, not a planned program. The key person, Hans Litten, hopes to use this event to expose Hitler and Nazism as something disgusting. He failed. The majority agrees with their ideas. Why? This is never addressed. Hitler was popularly elected. Litten went to his death in the camps since he believed in the residual morality left over from the Judeo/Christian culture. He was wrong. (See Peter Gay, a German scholar, ""The Enlightenment: The Rise of Modern Paganism."")

The contrast between Litten's trust in law and moral principles and the majority's devotion to the 'general will' is clear. The Biblical truth that God gives morality, not humans or any human group, to me explains the vicious hatred of the Jews. This is the people that delivered an unalterable, uncompromising system of law and ethics not open to change by anyone at anytime. It removes the power of the majority, the state, the leaders and everyone else. This seems to come accross in the film. (See George Steiner: ""In Bluebeards Castle"" pages 29 - 56)

Also, the Jewish scholar Jacob Talmon explains in ''Mission and Testimony'', ''Christian antisemitism permitted the Jew to exist for generations as a degraded witness, but the anti-Messianic antisemitism insisted on murdering the bringer of good tidings, the people identified with the Messianic idea. Talmon saw the Holocaust as the murderous crossroads of the historical encounter between Jewish Messianism and the bastard Messianism embodied in Hitler. 20 The Jews, the eternal people, represented for the Nazis the idea of the unity of all races and universal brotherhood. To kill them meant killing those who gave the world the universalistic commandment: Thou shalt not kill. Judaism was an ideal and at the same time a disturbing nightmare, both a souce of inspiration and a stimulus to aggressive impulses. The Jewish uniqueness which embodied the gospel of the unity of mankind was attacked by those who inscribed on their banner war against the unity of mankind and saw the Jews as the enemy as well as the yardstick of their deterministic-racist gospel. The apocalypse of the Holocaust was an attempt to murder the Messianic idea and its representatives.'' (loc. 329) These are explanations that this film does not provide.

Also, Isaiah Berlin noted the German poet Heine wrote in 1832 that the Germans would destroy Western civilization. ""Implacable Kantians with axe and sword will uproot the soil of our European life to tear out the roots of the past. Armed Fichteans will appear restrained neither by fear or greed. . .and most terrible of all would be Schelling's disciples, the Philosophers of Nature who, isolated and unapproachable beyond the barriers of their own obsessive ideas, will identify themselves with the elemental forces of the demonic powers of ancient german pantheism."" (As quoted by Melanie Phillips in ""The-World-Turned-Upside-Down"" page 208) This film confirms Heine's prophecy.

This is a fine drama. Nevertheless, it creates more questions than it answers.",1445731200,7,4281,5.176300578034682
7276180,4,B00ZCOF0I6,"Everyone in the audience wants justice. In this case in 1931, a Jewish attorney - Hans Litten -wants to put Fascism on Trial - and what better way than to subpoena Hitler and force him to undergo cross-examination.

The issue was the murder by the Brown Shirts of German Communists and the German Prosecutors think that they can prove that Hitler is a perjurer and that his ""non-violent stance"" is nothing but words.  While the lawyer does succeed in embarassing the Fuehrer and showing inconsistency in his views,  he cannot stop the Nazi menace with one trial.  Nor does he really nail Hitler as he should have by clearly showing that Hitler expressly ordered the murders.

We learn that too many Germans do not want the truth or care. They want a strong leader...although the consequences of making Hitler too powerful are clearly revealed in the trial.  In the courtroom, Hitler testifies that he is following German law and not advocating violence UNTIL he becomes supreme leader and THEN he will change the laws to fit his views. .People did not listen to the import  of thos words - not even the Judge and surprisingly not even Hans Litten's Jewish father who thinks that Hitler may be a good choice for ""law and order"".  That response really shocked me.

We know the rest.",1440374400,14,1280,4.7040358744394615

8719827,3,B00ZCOF0I6,"-The acting is superb; the plot (focusing on Hitlers real-life, 1930 trial), compelling.....However, the screenwriters who penned, Hitler on Trial did the very young a grave disservice by portraying Hitler as the tediously overdone, Leftist Fantasy Villain (a far-right spinner of slogans; slow-witted, to the point of imbecility; unable to understandor even answerquestions posed to him by the hero, leftist prosecutor, without the constant assistance of HIS attorney). Not only did they fail to portray the genuine Hitlerbut they added to the false narrative that the NEXT Hitler will be just as easy to spot, due to similar, obvious attributes....

-The real Hitler was (as his meteoric rise proved) an incredibly smooth operator. Not only was he a giftedand mesmerizing speaker, he was also quick on his feet (the portrayal of him being at a constant loss for wordsor answersis laughable. Hitler was able to deceive and manipulate the most brilliant men of his erawith ease, and on a regular basis). Furthermore, he was a master at disguising his own feelings (as many duped great Statesmen would attest to); there was no loss of control on his part (as shown throughout this film), nor obvious, outward physical manifestations of stress....In short: no one of the era who knew Hitler at all would recognize the silly, clueless dolt portrayed here......I find this fairly frightening, for, as time passes, and the last of the WWII generation disappears, later generations only know the cardboard, bogey-man Hitlers, as portrayed here....When the next one appears (and he WILL), is there even the vaguest hope they will recognize him?.......",1525046400,8,1644,5.250950570342205

8719832,4,B00ZCOF0I6,"Good film which deals with the infamous trial of Hitler. Shows the megalomania of Hitler before he assumes power in Germany and the pathological liar he was. Well acted. It is a dramatized story of Hans Litten, the young German Jewish lawyer who wanted to expose Hitler and the Nazis for what they were and the fate that awaited Litten once they assumed power.",1489622400,,360,4.640625
8719833,4,B00ZCOF0I6,"I am giving this film 4 stars for the story. This is because the character playing Hitler was awful, but the film was nonetheless interesting & the bonus feature - even better. Based on court transcripts from the actual court case, it was incredible to witness the strength and conviction of the 27 year old attorney who had the guts to put him on the stand, especially being a Jew. The film is set in Berlin in the summer of 1931. Hans Litten is fed up with what's happening to his city and decided to subpoenas Adolf Hitler as a witness in the trial of some Nazi thugs (SA33) responsible for shooting up a bar full of Russian communists. Ian Hart was wonderful as Hans, but again I wish anyone other than Ed Stoppard would have played Hitler. He just stood at the witness stand looking like a pissed off teenager. The acting made you feel something entirely different than what I am sure Hitler was feeling at the time. But other than that, it was an incredible story. The true gem of this film is the bonus feature where we learn of the tragic fate of the young attorney who cross-examined Hitler for three hours. In 1933, Hitler retaliated and Litten was arrested on the night of the Reichstag fire along with many other other leftists and progressive lawyers. For the remaining five years of his life, Litten was moved from one German concentration camp or another. He was forced to endure endless torture and many interrogations. After they moved him to Dachau his treatment worsened and he committed suicide.",1484697600,,1515,4.594095940959409
