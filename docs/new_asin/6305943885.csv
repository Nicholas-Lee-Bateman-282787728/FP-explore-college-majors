7898110,5,6305943885,"While the first installment of this series is pure exploitation with little or no promise of what the follow-up would hold, Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41 delivers beyond belief. I had the fortune of watching this one before the first film, and I can gladly recommend anyone not to invest any time in the first, but indeed to watch this one. This is art. The strong script with the social-feminist critique in combination with beautiful footage, along with great acting and imaginative editing makes it a film to return to many times over.",1362096000,2,546,4.881720430107527
7898111,5,6305943885,"If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, check out this amazing film. The opening scene alone is worth the price of admission. I saw this at a film festival and knew I had to own it so I could loan it out to other people. This easily makes my Top 10 Best Movies You Never Heard of list.",1086048000,11,298,3.9833333333333334
7898112,5,6305943885,"Well, I think I should cut right to the chase: FEMALE CONVICT SCORPION: JAILHOUSE 41 is quite possibly the most fascinating and visually stunning film I have ever had the pleasure to see ... And that praise comes from fan who loves ( and also admires ) films such as BLACK NARCISSUS, KWAIDAN, SUSPIRIA, and VERTIGO to name a few ......  To simply describe the plot of FEMALE CONVICT SCORPION would be a great injustice .. This is not your run-of-the-mill women in prison film ( although I do enjoy that genre ) ... YES, the story is fascinating and so perfectly simple ... The true beauty comes in the genius of transforming a simple story into a visual and creative feast for the senses, in particular, your eyes ......  But what are visuals without performance ???  ... This film wouldn't know ....  The acting is brilliant, particularly Meiko Kaji who, with one glance, can send either a chill down your spine, or send butterflies to your stomach ...  Does it sound as if I love this film ??? ... I DO !!! ... I highly recommend FEMALE CONVICT SCORPION: JAILHOUSE 41 .... The colors are breathtaking, and the overall look for the film is awesome ...If there is one flaw regarding this DVD, it is in the transfer: during dark scenes, a ""transparent"" ( for lack of a better word ) band can be seen down the right side of the screen ... Strangely, this line is NOT visible in the trailer ... This band can also be seen occasionally in BLACK TIGHT KILLERS, a Japanese film released by the same manufacturer .... It's not bad enough to take a star away, but it is noticable during dark scenes ...  Simply put, FEMALE CONVICT SCORPION is one of the best films I've ever seen ...",1018137600,23,1675,4.457516339869281
7898113,5,6305943885,"A masterwork as only the japanese can deliver it! A mix between kabuki-theater, women in prison trash and stylish revenge flick! If you are into entertaining trash with an edge, buy this film now! If you are into linear non-experimental movie, than forget this one...
I'll never forget the vicious female convict scorpion answering the police officers question about the prisoners in the bus... ""They're all dead"". What a mean motha she is!
By the way, I had no probelm with the disc, non at all.",977875200,4,496,4.77906976744186
