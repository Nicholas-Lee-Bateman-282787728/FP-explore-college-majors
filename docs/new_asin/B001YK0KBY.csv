3829854,4,B001YK0KBY,"I purchased these DVDs in April because I am not a fan of working out.  I usually get bored after a short period of time but I figured that ""dancing"" would be a little more interesting.  So far I have only used ""Booty Beat"" and ""Chair Fit"" and I have enjoyed them.  The moves on Booty Beat are not difficult but they do combine together to create a nice little workout when you are crammed for time.  (About 30 minutes.)  The Chair Fit takes about an hour and is definitely worth it.  It is designed as circuit training using hand weights gradually building up the weight.  I purchased this product off of the flirty girl website, (I did not receive the boa) and have been pleased.  It's kept me interested enough to continue doing it and I have noticed more definition in certain muscles.

Granted this video is not going to teach you how to be a stripper.  But it is definitely more entertaining than any other aerobics routine I have been apart of.  It's worth actually trying the moves rather than just watching it and making fun of them.",1244073600,21,1042,4.431578947368421
3829855,1,B001YK0KBY,"I watched the routine for video vixen, the chair dances, booty beat, and just teasing. None of them where as exciting as the commercial portrayed them to be. The pink boa sent with the videos is in pieces just from taking it out of the packaging. I too will be returningt these videos. These workouts aren't worth the money. Get them used for under $10 or not at all.",1241913600,18,367,4.333333333333333
3829856,2,B001YK0KBY,"The only two videos I have opened so far are the Booty Beat and the Chair Dance. I haven't learned the moves for the chair dance yet, but i can tell you that it is not going to be a workout at all. Furthermore, if you are a horrible uncoordinated dancer like I am then this probably won't be for you. You have to spend some time learning the routine before you can ever do the so called workout. Once I learned the Booty beat routine, it seemed like the entire workout was about 15 minutes. You do the same routine 8 times in a row. I am overweight and haven't exercised in a very long time and I barely broke a sweat...you'd probably have to do the workout 3 times in a row and incorporate weights in order to get an actual workout. I can't stop thinking about middle school cheerleading tryouts.",1239926400,41,797,4.215686274509804
3829857,1,B001YK0KBY,"I saw the informercial to this numerous of times and thought wow ok I want to have some additional sexy moves to add a little extra fire in the bedroom and get a good workout doing so. Didn't care too much about the packaging but I popped in the dvd (Booty Beat) and watched it before getting down to the ""workout""...I was sooo disappointed. The ""instructor"" was not even into none of the so called sexy ""moves"" the girl in the back in all black was more into the moves/energetic than the instructor (if she was the instructor I probably would've gotten my moneys worth). The moves was if as though she was making them up as she went along and they weren't at all challenging just sitting watching the horrifying ""workout"" you can tell you are not going to bust not one sweat. Granted her body is amazing but if she was an exotic dancer based on the moves alone she would get change. As far as the bedroom goes..I'll stick to my moves it's far less disappointing. Oh, and I am shipping this thing back to the factory it came from I may be short changed in the end with shipping but it's not worth having it collecting dust on the shelf.",1238889600,45,1136,4.313084112149533
3829858,2,B001YK0KBY,"I saw a infomercial for this product and was really excited to receive it and it wasn't what I expected.  My first impression after opening the box was that the appearance of the packaging and DVDs seemed cheap but I always believe you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but I believe my first impression was accurate on this one.  The best way I can describe this is it comes across to me as a teenage dance routine.  Where you are repeatedly walking through a series of moves and ultimately combining them to form a supposedly sexy dance.  I am in fairly good shape and was hoping for it to be more along the lines of a fun workout-didn't break a sweat.  I was also very annoyed by the sound of the instructor's voice (my husband was in the other room and mentioned it as well).  [...]",1237593600,69,790,4.304054054054054
3829859,2,B001YK0KBY,"I agree with most of the reviewers; as a 30+ year veteran dancer trained in various dance styles as well as yoga, I found these DVD's to be not at all challenging.  However, if you push yourself harder than the umm...""instructor"" while doing them, you can get a decent little, albeit slow, cardio workout on the fly.  Out of curiosity, I purchased only the teaser pack from the infomercial; it was less than $20.00 including S&H for 2 DVD's, so I don't feel too bad about the money spent.  I really didn't see the need to have the whole ""enchilada"" package, as it was just another way to get in some movement when I was too tired to do something more challenging.  What I hated was sitting through a phone barage of the most annoying package pitches ever; I finally hung up after 15 minutes of this noise. They obiviously got the message and sent just the 2 ""try out"" DVD's - with nothing more to buy.  And again, they're just okay, but that's it.  However, if you want a challenge, try Rodney Yee, Sean Corn or Baron Baptiste's power yoga series'; even Denise Austin's power yoga DVD gives you a run for money.  I also like Sara Ivanhoe's DVD's for some quick, effective yoga workouts.  For dance workouts, try Neon's trio of ""Luscious"", ""Hard Candy"" or ""Love Potion"" belly dance workouts, and she has lots of other titles to choose from as well.  There's also Sera and her ""East Coast Tribal Dance"" series from World Dance NYC, and many others under that brand name.  You can also try any number of ""Samba"" dance DVD's, but I caution you, if it's a good Samba DVD, you're going feel like your heart is about to burst in the beginning; but if you work through it (and that will take time and diligence), it will reward you with amazing stamina and a ""sexy, bitchin' bod"" to boot.  So if you really want to break a sweat, these DVD's and others like them will get you there.  Unfortunately, most of these particular titles mentioned are not for rank beginners, but there are tons of excellent ones out there for those folks just starting out or just getting back into to doing some type of exercise.  Read the reviews before you purchase anything; Amazon's reviewers are some of the best and most savvy shoppers around!  Getting back to the Flirty Girl series, DO NOT expect a whole lot - they're just to get you moving and nothing more.  And we all know that any type of movement is better than being a couch potato - LOL!!!",1284076800,9,2425,4.45475113122172
3829860,1,B001YK0KBY,"I thought this workout would be fun since I saw a pretty good trailer on tv. Nope. It was terrible. The dance section was retarded. Nothing was ""sexy"" or flirty. If you did any of these routines on your guy, he would probably laugh at you. I think this was created by some out of work strippers because even the video quality was poor. Don't waste your money.",1281398400,6,359,4.294117647058823
3829861,1,B001YK0KBY,"I watched the infomercial and went directly to the offical site and purchased the 2 DVD's.  If you're looking for a REAL fun flirty exercise dance DVD, this is not it, trust me.  The exercise routine comprised of just a few moves, repeats over and over and over, get the picture?  This is a great example of how a with marketing and advertising, it makes you eager to buy, but leaves you saying,""what a waste of money"".",1280534400,5,419,4.415584415584416
3829862,2,B001YK0KBY,"When I watched the infommercial, I could hardly wait to order the DVD.  I was completely disappointed with how ineffective the workout was, I couldn't break a sweat no matter how hard I tried.  Waste of time.  Not a workout at all.",1268438400,,231,4.4523809523809526
3829863,1,B001YK0KBY,"I got my first shipment of flirty girl fitness dvds a couple months ago & was super excited to try them out. i love dancing & really wanted to start working out again. after trying them out i was frustrated. they are not easy to follow & i hate to say i turned it off before it was finished. i tried it again another day thinking i was just having a bad day, but once again, even after replaying parts i couldn't understand multiple times, i just turned it off. when i my second shipment came i just sent it back, asked for a refund & requested no more shipments. since i'm stuck with my first shipment i've tried each dvd several times & am so disappointed. i've done many video workouts, been on dance teams, & i've never been this frustrated before. even worse, i don't feel like i got a workout at all! i'm going to sell the dvds, they just remind me of wasted money.",1266019200,5,871,4.190476190476191
3829864,5,B001YK0KBY,This is a unique video but after doing the exercises I was so sore the next day and realize I had a lot of fun being flirty and working out!,1264032000,3,140,3.7
3829865,1,B001YK0KBY,"If you have any interest in making a serious effort in your fitness, body toning and aerobics do not get this collection.  It looks like it was done in someones spare apartment room. The person who leads the moves has no confidence and obviously lacks training herself.  The sound quality is non-existent. The people who are putting this out don't believe in putting out quality. I can't believe people remain in business putting out a product as cheap as this one.",1253404800,10,465,4.728395061728395
3829866,1,B001YK0KBY,"I got very bored with this work out very fast.  I am a beginner at working out, when I first started it I was sore, and I'm sure the more I do it the more I will be sore.  I did break a very small sweat the first time i did it, then the more i did it the less i sweated, and now i don't sweat at all.  And i've only done it maybe 5 times at the most.  It is just not challenging and the dances are cheezy and corny, the instructor is annoying and seems like she thinks the routine is ridiculous too, this dvd is ridiculous!",1250121600,9,523,3.727272727272727
3829867,5,B001YK0KBY,I love these videos! They are fun and can definitely give you a good workout!,1245974400,3,77,4.2
8348109,5,B001YK0KBY,"I have had this workout routine for many years. When I first started the program I slimmed down so much that people would say I was getting too small. I allowed what others thought about my weight loss to discourage me from doing the workout. However,  I  realized that this workout is so intense I dropped weight effortlessly and easily. Also as long as I do this routine 3-5 days a week I don't have to diet the fat just melts aways. I have to be honest this is very difficult program and very intense but it works.",1479427200,,517,4.26530612244898
8348110,5,B001YK0KBY,I used the booty beat workout in 2010 I went from a size 11 to a size 3. Just in three months so it does work if you do it. I did it everyday and was amazed,1436227200,,156,3.2432432432432434
8348111,1,B001YK0KBY,"I had purchased the flirty girl fitness dvds on their website so I could warm up/ break a sweat before going on a jog/a real work out. I was highly dissatisfied with the product altogether. It was slow paced, I never really caught a burn nor the sweat I was intending to get either. I was more successful just using a cheap work out ball from Walmart and the perfect push up.

Do NOT buy from the site, if you don't return the dvds within 30 days you will activate a membership account where they will send you more dvds for twice the price you paid for the first two. I had called their customer service and requested a cancellation and the man on the phone only offered me a $10 credit from the 26.99 they had charged me and told me that I had to pay 9.99 for the next months membership payment as well. It has been such a head ache.

 I have had to call in disputes with my bank to get any reaction from the company. Needless to say, you may have to order a new credit card because they will keep taking until you file harassment and fraud.

Not a very respectable company, if I do say so myself. I suggest finding a different routine dvd, or going to your local video stores for work out dvds so you can avoid the scams of online fitness dvd sellers altogether.

I did not read any negative reviews on their website and now I know why. Let it be known, they will take and take until you straight up change your account information with the bank. NOT worth the stress or head ache.

Save yourself the time, you'll end up getting a better work out getting pissed and throwing shit around than actually doing their routines.

I had purchased Booty Beat and G.I Jane, neither were what they were cracked up to be. Also, if you want to see the workouts first hand before buying them, you can youtube flirty girl fitness workouts... FOR FREE.",1369094400,,1840,4.2701149425287355
8348112,4,B001YK0KBY,"I am a stay at home Mom with 5 children ages 2 to 12. I don't have a lot of time to get much excercise between hauling the kids back and forth between school, gymnastics, swim lessons, etc. I thought the Flirty Girl Fitness program would be fun and get me off my butt for a couple of hours a day. I started out doing one full video in the morning after the kids go to school. I thought it was a lot of fun and my two year old likes it too. Usually he won't let me get anything done. If I do sit-ups or push-ups he climbs all over me. He'll let me push him in the stroller while we go for short walks, but eventually gets restless. This is something I can do at home and he just kind of dances along and does his own thing. Some of the other reviews are kind of dishartening, but I thought it was fun and it is a workout. Obviously it's not like hard core physical training, but it doesn't claim to be. I'm not a body builder or a gymnast but I'm in pretty good shape and this is all I really have time to do.",1356998400,2,1008,3.8509615384615383
8348113,5,B001YK0KBY,"I actually really love these dvds. I personally have a lot of fun doing them. They might not be right for everyone, but I love them. I'm a girly-girl who likes to be sexy and have fun while working out. You do not have to necessarily sweat to lose weight, though it helps get rid of toxins. Cardio is what makes you lose weight, along with a healthy diet. I even sweated a little bit with Booty Beat, but I have a lot of fun doing it, making me get into the dvd more.
Just Teasing is a dance routine with a boa. I had fun doing it, but it's the one that is hardest to follow for me, but I just watched the section I had trouble with a few times and then get it down.
Chair Fit can get kinda hard, especially if you can't do tricep dips, but I do feel the workout, and still have fun. I think the chair makes it a bit more fun.
Chair Dance is also fun to me. It kinda reminds me of the chair dance in the Burlesque section of the Pussycat Dolls workout dvd, the 2nd one I believe.
I think I have a lot more fun with these workouts than some people because I'm into dancing a lot. You just have to have fun, and actually work for it.
The Abs and Booty I can feel the workout too, and I still can't do some of it. I'm not new to dance workouts, but I'm not the best at aerobic/strength/weight lifting type exercises.
As for people who keep saying that they are a scam because they sign you up for the program, if you purchase on the site, there is a link, under the picture on the site saying that they will sign you up for the Flirty Girl Fitness Program. I'm just kinda getting tired of reading reviews everywhere that they didn't know they were going to be signed up for it, and then calling it a scam, when there is something telling you that they are going to. As for the phone calls, you just have to stand your ground. They are a company wanting to sell you stuff. Just say no if you don't want something, and be firm about it.
*I added this on* I bought some of the newer Flirty Girl Fitness dvds, including the Ultimate Booty Beat 1, and the quality of the dvds have definitely been made better!
For anyone who has bought from the Flirty Girl Fitness site, have you had any problems buying from the site?",1333584000,2,2210,4.059496567505721
8348114,4,B001YK0KBY,"When I first saw this on an infomercial, I was completely skeptic.  However, it was a different approach to my workouts (always went to the gym and it got a little boring)and I heard that it could help with weight loss as well I purchased the Chair Dance, Chair Fit,Booty Beat, Abs & Booty, Pole Dance, Pole Fit plus the pole to give it a try.  Believe it or not, it's not that bad!

The Chair Fit workout is very inventive and utilizes what you have at home so you're not buying a ton of other things to work out with.  It was a very great workout that left me sore the next day.  Even though I workout almost every single day, I subsitute that for two workout days and I've noticed that I'm getting stronger from the last time I use that particular workout.  Chair Dance and Pole Dance is just a nice little bonus so you can learn something sexy for your partner.  I wouldn't use Booty Beat nor Chair Dance as a form of exercise though.

I do agree with the other reviewers that the packaging is less than ideal. When it was shipped to me, the Pole Dance DVD's container broke and the DVD has a scratch on it and I can't see the second part of that workout because I haven't had the time to get a DVD doctor to fix the scratch.  If you're a bigger woman, you won't be able to use the stripper pole because of a weight restriction.  Abs & Booty seems really disorganized.  You will feel and see some results but not as dramatic as the commercial states.  I was also given a menu of food I can eat and since I have Celiac Disease, most of the things on the menu I can't have.  The food that I can have, it's not bad. I really wish that one day they'll have a fitness center in my area but for now, I'll use the videos!",1332806400,,1718,4.092537313432836

I love it!!! I am slightly overweight and have trying dieting walking, running, trendmills, sit-up, push-up, and the WII with very little success.  But with the flirty girl fit program not only is it fun it works for me too.  I have a short attention span but I am absolutely addicted to this program!  I like that they set it up in three stages, if you're a whimp like me, an average exerizer, and a super human.  I also am a fan of the fact that their is a whiner in every group. = ) I think of it as encouragement and I have lost five pounds already! YAY!!!! If you are on the fence my suggestion is do it.",1302220800,4,659,4.038461538461538
8348117,5,B001YK0KBY,"I always look at amazon reviews before purchasing something, but usually never write one. I love these videos so much that I feel inclined to offer my opinion to others who are considering buying.

Honestly I am shocked after reading the other reviews on here. I have tried MANY other videos, dances and classes and have never enjoyed any as much as these. I have everything from the Firm to a 24 hour fitness membership... and usually have a hard time being motivated to work out. I usually get bored within 1-2 times of doing anything, but these videos are so much fun. I have the complete set and also the pole.

The videos are EXCELLENT. They are NOT hard to follow and are very challenging. You go at your own pace with the weights and if you are disciplined, you WILL see results. The whole set has a wide variety of exercises so it's not hard to switch around and get a great workout. I have done one video everyday for the last 3 weeks and have already recommended them to everyone I know... including my mother.

I did not buy them directly from the site, but did have to get a replacement part for the pole... I agree that the credit companies calling after I made my purchase were irritating, but I just ignored them. If you can purchase elsewhere do so. But if you are serious about getting in shape and need something convenient at home, these videos are great! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1299024000,5,1393,4.454901960784314
8348118,1,B001YK0KBY,I also bought this through the main website and I have to say that I am not happy with it at all.  I don't feel that you get a good workout from this.  I like to feel the burn but with this there is no burn.  I don't recommend this to anyone who is wanting a good well worth it workout.,1298332800,2,286,3.6557377049180326
