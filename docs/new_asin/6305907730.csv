7898472,4,6305907730,"I got this movie on a lark, although I tend to like early pre-censorship B+W films. The film told a story without the hang-ups of worrying about what the audience would think and considering it is from another era, I found it to be a most interesting film. I had to watch parts of it twice to catch some subtle nuances, which made the film even more enjoyable. If you like early B+W films, I highly recommend this one.",1008460800,23,418,4.30379746835443
