8196033,5,B000QFCFXE,"Everything in this DVD is great and practical - Self confidence really is everything!  He says to have a clear goal and remind yourself of it every single day. He also says that negative thoughts attract negativity, and I totally believe this.  A common denominator for success is confidence, and successful people absolutely believe that they'll be a big success.  You become what you believe in!  You can't afford to have low self-confidence.

I love this DVD and watch it every once in a while for a reminder.  Highly recommended!",1194566400,7,533,4.866666666666666
