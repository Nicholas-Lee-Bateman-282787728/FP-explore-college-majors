8458111,5,B0055DXR84,"As a beginner/intermediate player, who has no pro-musical experience, I found that this DVD is very intuitive, well thought, of excellent clarity and overall extremely practical. If your skill level is beyond intermediate, you can still grab some cool licks from this DVD. After all, advanced players don't need DVDs.

Menu: Lick 1-10, Lick 11-20,... all the way up to 50

Style: Real genuine authentic jazz. A little bit of effects just to spice it up, no crazy stuff. Every single one of these licks, sounds like jazz. Personally, I don't like Richard Smith's jazz tutorial, which is a jazz-rock tutorial. Sounds weird to me.

Learning Curve: If you are better than beginner, you can learn this. It starts off with very easy stuff, and builds your way up.

What I don't like: If you really want to learn jazz instead of just a few licks, you need a book. So it's not the DVD's problem, it's Lick Library and it gives you the licks. However, I do hope that Stuart Bull could explain more behind the licks.

The good thing is, all licks in this DVD can be easily applied to most jazz backing tracks, very practical licks.
