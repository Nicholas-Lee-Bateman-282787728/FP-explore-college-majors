3649596,5,B001IS0G02,"I bought this DVD because my VHS tape finally just wore out and stopped playing! I've been using this workout for over 10 years, along with others, and find that it is the best for reshaping my body.",1391644800,6,199,4.2631578947368425
3649597,5,B001IS0G02,"The Hare and the Tortoise are two of my favorite FIRM workouts. I have been a huge fan The FIRM for many years, and have several favorites, but these rise to the top. I love the music (I am a dancer) and the work out can be adapted to make it more strenuous if desired. After doing  each of these two workouts I feel energized and motivated.",1366934400,2,341,4.08955223880597
3649598,2,B001IS0G02,"I was very disappointed, I was expecting much more from Tracie Long...
This video is OK.
The music is rather boring, it's slow, and the cardio segments on the step are very low intensity.
I couldn't get my heart rate up at all.
The lifting segments are very general, consisting of very few lunges, step ups, and curls.

I would recommend this workout for a beginner to the Firm or for pregnant women.

If you are someone who is familiar with the older Firm workouts, this probably won't do much for you either.

As a side note, The Hare is literally the same thing, it isn't any faster and it includes some general lifting segments.",1302998400,6,632,4.478260869565218
3649599,5,B001IS0G02,"I had this DVD in VHS format years ago and made the mistake of loaning it to a "" friend"" and never got it back!!! This video killed me but I loved it!!!",1273449600,,152,3.6363636363636362
8311332,4,B001IS0G02,Always happy with the firm. Tracy Long is awesome. Only problem is transitions are quick between exercises and I find myself pausing to adjust weights.,1492992000,,151,5.08
8311333,1,B001IS0G02,Love the video - but can't get this copy to work. Seems to be blank.,1492732800,,68,3.6
8311334,5,B001IS0G02,Love it.  Some new moves and I like Tracie Long.,1444348800,,48,3.8
8311335,5,B001IS0G02,"Definitely NOT the DVD to start with if you are new to The Firm.  It can be a good companion to other Firm DVD's from the classic days, though.  I am a Firm Believer from WAY back, when Volume One was advertised in Cosmo, and the VHS tape cost $50.  An exorbitant price for the mid-nineteen eighties.  But the classic workouts from the 80's and early 90's are truly, truly the very best workout tapes on the planet.  I turn to them again after going astray.  Please note that in this video they do not suggest weight numbers, for example, no one says, ""Pick up three to five pounds""  They just pick up some weights and let you guess.  They use a barbell of indeterminate weight and a very short, maybe 6-inch step-up box as well as a tall box.  Again, they don't say what they are using.  I had to get used to it, but now I love it, and it is a favorite.
 Stick with it!  The dance moves take some getting used to.  All of The Firm classics are wonderful, make no mistake about that.  It's a good overall workout.",1442880000,3,1013,4.181347150259067
8311336,5,B001IS0G02,"One of my top 10 ever workouts. While it is true that the cardio here is not very challenging, if you use the heavy weights that you should, you will be thankful for the little break. The cardio is a short respite and back we go to heavy weights. Tracey is great here and this is one of the handful of workouts that helped me lose 40 lbs without really dieting over a period of 8 months.",1430352000,5,387,4.038961038961039
8311337,4,B001IS0G02,This is a great workout!  You get a fully chaptered DVD at Collage Video for $14.99.  What gives with the ridiculous pricing here?,1429056000,3,130,4.608695652173913
8311338,5,B001IS0G02,everything was fine,1426291200,,19,5.666666666666667
8311339,1,B001IS0G02,The day I received the dvd I anxiously opened it to review the entire workout! My other copy of the Firm is a VHS and is worn out from years and years of use. During the first review the workout paused several times but only briefly so it was tolerable. Over the next couple of weeks the dvd now stops and the amount of inactivity increases  each time. It has become very annoying! Can you please advise what guidelines to follow to get a good copy of the Firm which I really want or to get my money back.,1420416000,,505,4.101010101010101
8311340,5,B001IS0G02,"The Tortoise and The Hare are my 2 favorite Firm Cross-training DVDs. I'm 50+ and an intermediate exerciser. These were perfect: challenging and yet DOABLE. The ballroom dancing segments were fun, and I loved the floor work of the Hare. Recommend as ""just right"" for those who find the original Firms a bit too much.",1395014400,3,316,4.763636363636364
8311341,5,B001IS0G02,"Yes it is old, but you will feel it, and you will feel it in the areas where you want it, try the gluts, the upper thighs, and the triceps.  Tracie Long you are superb!!  She's the bomb.  This workout consist of light aerobics and resistance, resistance that includes: forward lunges, backward lunges and leg lifts, each one of the lunges and leg lifts include weights, for the experience person that does exercise, it will be undeniable that you will  feel this in the gluts and the frontal and rear thighs, what  a synergistic and good combination, this workout is. For the experience person, this will be a challenge for you, you will find yourself huffing and puffing saying ""the step again""  As the cover says, you will see results, if you remain consistent, you will see results in those problematic areas (glut, thighs and upper arms) your body will be your report card.  This is a good workout to do 3 times weekly with a cardio the other day, trust me, if you have any other tapes/DVDs,  in resistance, I don't think it will score to high over this one.  This is one of the many classic firm workouts that deserves a ""Platinum''  It takes about three workouts to tolerate this one, but well worth it.  You will not be sorry.",1394409600,6,1233,4.509009009009009
