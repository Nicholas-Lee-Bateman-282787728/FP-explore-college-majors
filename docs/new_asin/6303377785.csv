7845740,5,6303377785,"I love this movie!  Julie Brown gives you two hilarious stories when she portrays Tonya Hardly and then Lenora Babbitt, those dangerous 5'2"" women.

You already know what the ""attacks"" will consist of, but wait'll you see what she does with these stories.",1463443200,,255,4.906976744186046
7845741,2,6303377785,"Needed This for my National Lampoon's Collection
They have made some funny films Animal House, Van Wilder, Christmas Vacation, and more
However This is not one very few laughs here but it is a oldie and hard to find and Stars Downtown Julie Brown from MTV personality
but not worth running to store for or online I might add because it's not the greatest slice of cinema.",1458086400,,371,4.552238805970149
7845742,5,6303377785,"Julie Brown is one of the funniest comediennes i've ever seen! i just wish she had more material available, i remember a song of hers about a homecoming queen with a gun.  she's jus amazingly talented and also very good looking.  i had been wanting to own this movie for a very long time now.",1362614400,,292,4.290909090909091
7845743,5,6303377785,"Be careful, men!  Lorna Bobbsit is after you!  It is very well written and Julie Brown is amazing.  Timely for 1994, but if you remember Tonya Harding and Lorena Bobbit, you'll be completely entertained.",1328140800,,203,4.911764705882353
7845744,5,6303377785,This movie has been released on DVD by Julie Brown herself... and it's available EXCLUSIVELY through her store on EBay... just search for it and you will find it!  justjulieproductions is the username!,1264032000,4,201,5.090909090909091
7845745,5,6303377785,"This one of the ""Classics"" of the comedy spoofs. Kind of corny but very funny.",1249171200,,78,4.266666666666667
7845746,5,6303377785,"This video contains two movie shorts starring JULIE BROWN. She has repeatedly shown she is a woman with an enourmous Funny Bone, and this is no exception. My favorite song is ""Queen of the Ice"". Just hilarious. She should have release all these songs on another album. Already have ""Trapped in the body of a White Girl"" from the 80's and it was fantastic as well. JUST LOVE HER!!",1091232000,2,379,4.507246376811594
7845747,5,6303377785,"This ""double-feature"" Julie Brown vehicle captures the mid-90s scandals of Tonya Harding and Lorena Bobbitt and hilariously parodies them to great effect.
This movie originally aired on Showtime and I'm glad it's available on video, but I can't wait (and I'm holding out hope for) the DVD.  I would love to have Julie Brown's hilarious performance of ""Queen of the Ice"" blasting out of my surround sound! :)
Get this movie...it's great!",1014768000,4,436,5.055555555555555
7845748,5,6303377785,"The scandal and controversy that surrounded the Tonya Harding/Nancy Carrigan ordeal was begging for a parody and Julie Brown delivers it with  all the overblown melodrama that it deserves. I think the funniest thing in  the entire movie is when Tonya is reading her ""death threat"" to a  group of reporters and uses VapoRub to start crying but instead ends up  yelling that ""it burns"" and then punches her trashy bum of a  boyfriend. Though the Lorena Bobbitt portion of the movie is a bit dragged  out, it too is a funny parody of a ridiculous story from American culture  in the 1990s. Julie Brown is a comic queen and extremely underrated  performer. Check this movie out for yourself!",947203200,3,687,4.714285714285714
