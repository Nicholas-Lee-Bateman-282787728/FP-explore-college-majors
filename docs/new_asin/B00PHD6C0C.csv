8687920,5,B00PHD6C0C,"I was stunned to find a documentary about the Yukon Gold Rush.  It is such an unusual period in history that I felt certain it would not be featured in any historical programming.  Thankfully, I was wrong!  Great program (definitely in ""Ken Burns"" style) and wonderful in the classroom to help students understand this event and to help them interpret Jack London's pieces set in this period.",1468972800,,392,4.82089552238806

""From July of 1897 to December of 1899, over 100,000 men and women journeyed to the far North in search of gold...

They became known as `stampeders.'""

The above is printed on-screen at the beginning of this excellent, informative documentary.

The Klondike Gold Rush (KGR) was a migration (or ""rushing"") of an estimated 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike region of the Yukon (in north-western Canada, just east of the Alaskan border) between 1897 and 1899.  (Gold was actually discovered in the Klondike region during the summer of 1896).

The KGR is famous because it was the richest gold strike in North American mining history.

Throughout the film are excerpts from the book ""The Klondike Stampede"" (1900) written by a correspondent who was actually at the KGR.  There is also a letter (dated March, 1898) that was written by an actual stampeder!

As well, there are brief comments made by historians and authors.

I was impressed with the brief black and white film footage and still-photographs of that time.

You'll find that this is a story of determination, luck, fortune, disappointment, loss, and even death.  As well, it isn't all about the gold but rather the difficult journey to the Klondike itself.

Finally, there are no extras.

Oh.  I forgot.  The last name of the narrator of this documentary is (you probably guessed it) GOLD.

In conclusion, this film presents the true story of the Klondike Gold Rush, said to illustrate ""capitalism at its rawest.""

8687922,5,B00PHD6C0C,"Some years ago i read an old paperback on this subject. I could not put it down. That book had a number of pictures that helped the reader and the writing was great.
This movie reworks my previously created personal impressions into a more tangible representation. The entire era and the phenomenon are breathtaking and mesmerizing. The film captured stunning sights!  I loved it.  I only wish there could have been more.
The only factual issue I had was that in the book I read previously, nearly all of the miners left from Tacoma to begin their trek. The documentary implied that Seattle was the original first leg.  Otherwise, the stories and pictures describing the horrific journeys that took place mid-trip were the same. What a fascinating time to have lived in the Northwest.",1427846400,2,784,4.835820895522388

8687924,4,B00PHD6C0C,"This is a 60 minute DVD with no extras. It does have English subtitles.
There are actual films and photos used. Some do show the dead horses and men that died along the trails to the gold fields.
The film does a good job in illustrating what the men who wanted to get to the gold fields had to go through - the weather, the amount of supplies they had to take and what some of the conditions were when they arrived.  It includes a present day niece of a man who went there and died in an avalanche.

There is an interesting section about the women who went. Not all the men who went were extraordinary, but all the women were.
It also includes what modern day Dawson, where many of the hopeful miners set off to, is like today and also gold mining today.
It seems that some of the history is shortchanged with the inclusion of modern day Dawson, but this is still an interesting and educational film especially for those who wish to learn more about the history of the gold rush in Alaska.",1425600000,3,989,4.25531914893617
