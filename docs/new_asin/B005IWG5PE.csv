When I saw Suzanne Andrews on my local PBS station, I was very happy to find a program that allows me to go at MY pace.  She shows you how to do the exercises sitting on a chair, or supported by a chair or standing up, so you can go at the pace that suits you.  I started off sitting down and now I do the standing exercises.  You don't work up a sweat with the seated exercises, but you can get a bit of sweat with the standing exercises, which is just fine for me - I'm not looking to be a body builder - just want to keep being independent and stay out of the doctors office. If you're looking for a gentle workout to get you started, this is perfect, but if you want a really challenging workout that gets you out of breath and exhausted, this is not the DVD for you. She offers you two workouts and I appreciate her style, no screaming or yelling.  At my age I don't need to be screamed at. I also like the music, no headache music and you can do the exercises along with Suzanne's instruction and music or the bonus section offers you a choice to do the exercises to music only and just follow along.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Functional-Fitness-Fat-Burning-Workout-with-Suzanne-Andrews/dp/B005IWG5PE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Functional Fitness: Fat Burning Workout with Suzanne Andrews</a>",1322092800,11,1483,4.754863813229572

8475165,3,B005IWG5PE,This workout is a good one for seniors.  The instruction is well done and the moves are appropriate.  I find the instructor a little annoying,1392076800,2,141,4.6
8475166,3,B005IWG5PE,Too much commentary in between exercise.  The feature without commentary was the same workout with all the commentary time but no audio.,1368748800,,136,5.181818181818182

8475168,3,B005IWG5PE,"The work outs themselves are ok but the presentation is a little annoying
I do not like its disjointed and its not consistent
They focus on middle person and crop the modified moves out  often",1362960000,3,192,4.485714285714286
8475169,5,B005IWG5PE,"Wow!! The Functional Fitness with Suzanne Andrews Fat Burning DVD has helped me tremendously! I have been struggling to lose weight for years and have even considered weight loss surgery. When I normally try to exercise, I usually get frustrated and quit. But this DVD makes it easy to workout, even when you are a plus size like me. I know the fat burning is taking place because my clothes are already getting smaller. I have more energy throughout the day and the exercising is motivating me to eat less at meal time. I know I'm getting healthier every day as I workout with this DVD. It is truly the way to go when you want to exercise and get fit, but not in a room full of people. Being overweight makes me uncomfortable about working out in a crowd. I have gone to the gym, but being a 44-year-old fat chick in a room full of skinny 20-year-olds is no fun. I feel awkward and think everyone is staring at me struggling to keep up with the rest of the class. But with the Functional Fitness with Suzanne Andrews Fat Burning DVD, I can do a workout in the comfort of my own living room and not worry about what others think. I also like the fact you can skip the intro and go straight to the exercises when you are short on time. The music is great and something I would normally listen to when I'm not working out. Not only am I enjoying the DVD, my 82-year-old grandmother is even able to do it! Since the exercises can be done sitting down, she gets a workout in daily and feels ten years younger! Thanks to Suzanne Andrews for creating this fabulous fat burning DVD.",1322524800,11,1575,4.306397306397306
