8242327,5,B0011U526A,"If you are reading this, you are probably already a fan or at least know something of Robben Ford.  Robben is without doubt one of the very best guitarists around today.  He is the epitome of taste and tone (live or in the studio).  Never overly distorted or understated.  His music is a perfect fusion blend of blues, rock and jazz with no shortage of sophisticated, complex chords, progressions and scales.  I am a long time guitarist myself and he is my guitar guru and idol.  Let's not forget he is also a very good singer and a prolific songwriter as well.  I have all of his live concert DVD's and they are all great.  I like this one and the Paris concert from May 2001 the most.  His bands are always made up of great players and this band is excellent.  Robben really cooks on this one and has never sounded better.  Every song, each performance is top notch.  My one complaint is that this is not the whole concert.  The band's introduction and first song, Red Lady With Cello, a fine song from the Tiger Walk CD, were left off for some inexplicable reason.  I find this to be extremely puzzling and irritating.  This makes no sense to me and I find it to be inexcusable.  I mean, they couldn't fit one more song on there?  Come on now! Anyway, after getting over that disappointment this DVD is still well worth buying.  The photography, sound and production are done very well.  You can't go wrong with Robben.  Outstanding, superb performances, great music and superlative guitar playing.  It doesn't get any better than this.  What more can you ask for? I would also recommend his newest CD - Soul On Ten - which was recorded live in San Francisco.  It includes some blues classics as well as new R.F. originals and demonstrates how awesome he sounds live.  You won't be disappointed.",1253750400,,1798,4.512422360248447
8242328,5,B0011U526A,"This is the third Robben Ford dvd that I have purchased from Amazon, and it is very well done. There are lots of camera shots of Robben playing guitar, and many of them are closeups. He is supported by a great backup band, and my only complaint is that the keyboards are a little too loud on a couple of songs, but that Robben is still jamming on these songs and so is the rest of the band. The other two live dvd's of Robben Ford and his band, are also very well done.",1249171200,,469,4.0
8242329,5,B0011U526A,"Well I have been a Robben Ford fan for about 20 years. I even got to meet him when he came to Sydney with Larry Carlton last year. This DVD is his second outing with the excellent Ohnre Filter Musik Pur SWR series. The first one with the ""Blue Line"" band is the best. His very best is the New Paris Concert I reviewed about three years ago. This concert features a great band (as always) and is highlighted by the drummer Gary Novak. The keyboardist, Deron Johnson, is also superb.

This set features the greatness of Robben Ford's fusion of Jazz, Blues and R&B in an instrumental context. Most of the tunes on this disc are instrumentals which span the genres of Blues, Blues-Rock to Smooth Jazz. Robben plays his early 1960s Telecaster throughout the performance and, interestingly, he also includes one tune played on a vintage Stratocaster (""Tiger Walk"").

The set includes ""Just Like It Is"" which is an instrumental which becomes an ode to BB King in the 2000s as ""Indianola Blues"".  Robben sings  ""When I Leave Home"" as a straight ahead Blues-Rock tune. ""The Miller's Son"" is a variation on the Clapton-Mayall Blues cover instrumental ""Steppin' Out' and is very well done. ""Chevrolet"" features Ford's great knack of redefining other tunes, in this case ""Hey Gyp"" by Donovan and the Animals. It's a great version. ""Freedom"" is an interesting instrumental which brings to mind the smooth Jazz of Peter White (who played guitar on the ""Year Of The Cat"") and it has an interesting change in the bridge.

""Top Of the Hill"" is a Steely Dan inspired tune that also reminds one also of John Lennon. It's fantastic.  The last three tunes on this disc are instrumentals. ""Tiger Walk"" is an interesting tune which Robben plays on a 1950s Strat- very unusual (he now plays Gibsons!). ""The Champ"" is another hard hitting instrumental played on his Telecaster. The final tune ""In The Beginning"" is a great tune which goes into the final credits of the show. I own almost all of the ""Musik Pur"" series and in no other DVD does it do this. It tells me that this show was a ""second issue"" and it was the original show as it was aired in Germany. If this is true it makes this disc very unusual and special for this series.

The bottom line is if you are a Robben Ford fan this is a great, and a bit of a different show. If you are a guitarist you can watch Robben play his various diminished scales and Jazz chords. It's a fun show, good value and interesting. A lot of good music but different than his other DVDs. By the way, the cover photo, like with the Albert Collin's DVDs in this series, is not from this concert but the previous one.",1206489600,,2631,4.50314465408805

8242331,5,B0011U526A,"Somehow this DVD is sold where I live a week or so before the official release date in Europe. I paid twice as much as is the price at Amazon, but don't regret. If you have the previous Robben Ford DVD's you will now by now you need this one too. The video and sound are terrific. At ""Inakustic Gmbh"" studios they know what they are doing. There are PCM stereo and surround mixes and the picture is clear even zoomed in for the wide screen(the pic is in the 4:3 format unfortunately). The only other ""complain"" - the usual Ohne Filter 55 minutes length...The music is of course the expected high standard R.Ford delivers in the studio and live. You will enjoy this.",1204675200,,665,4.370967741935484
