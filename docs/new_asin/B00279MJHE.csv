3862870,5,B00279MJHE,"I loved this movie very much!!!!  It was scary how much Shirly MacLaine looked like Coco Chanel in her later years!!!  Brigitte Boucher was excellent at the young Coco Chanel...  Watching this movie, I felt that I was given entrance into the private world of Coco Chanel...  Being that I am a fashion designer myself, I learned so much from Madmoiselle's experiences in the fashion industry...",1249689600,2,393,4.909090909090909
3862871,5,B00279MJHE,"this dvd arrived in perfect condition. and the movie itself is amazing. i had always been a fan of chanel and having seen this movie made me love and appreciate the clothes, and the woman behind them, even more. thank you amazon.",1249603200,,229,4.476190476190476
3862872,3,B00279MJHE,"This movie is a wonderful story of love, heartbreak and the ability to overcome great odds and become extremely successful. I loved it when it was on TV and enjoyed it so much more with the additional scenes. I could not wait for it to come out on DVD. While it looks and sounds magnificent in widescreen on DVD, I was disappointed that the additional scenes were not included in the DVD version. They added depth to the story, and I cannot believe they were excluded from the DVD. I give it 5 stars for the story itself, but unfortunately, I only give the DVD 3 stars for leaving out the additional scenes.

5/11/10 - I decided to add to my review because apparently some people have not seen the extended version of Coco Chanel on TV.  Following are some of the additional moments I saw on the extended version (WARNING:  SPOILERS!):

When Boy was visiting Etienne at Royallieu, Coco overheard Etienne tell Boy that he was going to marry Coco.  However, when Coco confronted Etienne, he told her that he had only told Boy that because he thought he was losing her.  She knew she would never have a life with Etienne, so she left him.

Coco's sister who was left behind at the orphanage became pregnant.  She had a difficult delivery and Coco was summoned to be with her.  Coco arrived in time to see her sister, but she died shortly after childbirth.  Coco wanted to adopt the baby boy, but the nuns would not let her because she was not married.

During the war, Coco met up with Etienne in a military hospital.  He suffered a leg injury and told her that he was going to have to learn to ride side-saddle.  He told her that he often thought about her and he gave the impression that he was sorry he had let her go.  When he asked her about Boy, she told him that she loved Boy with all her heart.  Etienne was obviously hurt by this.",1247875200,3,1837,4.346041055718475
3862873,2,B00279MJHE,"As a fashion history buff, this movie dissapoints. It wallows too much in the love story between Coco and Etienne, then the years 1912-1914 when Coco made hats. Her real breakthrough was in the WW1 years, but the movie almost skips this period altogether. The acting is mostly bad... with the (french) voices sounding stiff and funny.
Also, the older Coco`s (Shirley Maclaine) comment that ""I have no one to thank but myself for my success"" is uncredible when the movie quite clearly shows her accepting a lot of grants from her lover Boy to finance her early career.
""Chanel solitaire"" from 1981 still stands as the major movie about Coco Chanel. Let`s see what ""Coco avant chanel"" brings when it opens this late summer.",1247702400,9,721,4.776
3862874,5,B00279MJHE,"I absolutely love this movie. i am so excited that is on dvd now. if you love fashion history then this is for you. if you love drama and romance then this is for you. if you're at all curious about this movie-just get it! it will not dissapoint you, i promise. this movie details what chanel is really about and how ""it"" came to be. it tells the story of coco's life starting from when she was a poor little girl in an orphanage to how her drive to succeed took her through many emotional and social challenges in order for her to become what ""we"" all know her as- ""THE GREAT COCO CHANEL"". Coco's stubbornness is both her gift and her downfall. I won't give anymore away-but that will become most evident throughout the whole movie.",1243814400,33,733,4.318840579710145

It does an excellent job of hitting the most important points of Chanel's life and centers in on her relationship with the love of her life, Boy Capel.

All of the facets of a woman who defied logic and the usual as to who could and/or should become a successful designer of fashion and perfume.

3862914,5,B00279MJHE,"Well Who doesn't love Shirley MacLaine Beaty  and Coco Chanel.  The convergence of two geniuses. A story told in Coco's youth and in the last decades. When a biography is made we all are aware of how much great people struggle and endure without calculation. Why they become great  and achieve more than most of us is :luck, hard work, endurance, huge talent, timing. MacLaine is such a magnificent  actress that it was seamless that she should portray this magnificent woman. For the person who loves biographies, fashion, retro and a great story this film won't disappoint .",1416700800,,576,4.846938775510204

3862932,5,B00279MJHE,"A must see for aspiring designers and those with careers in women's retail fashion. I won't go into the timeline story, as it is covered in several previous comments.  The filming was exceptional, the music is beautiful and the acting quite good with mostly Italian actors. The viewer gets a glimpse into the challenges and successes of Chanel's life.  Her original quotes throughout the film are inspiring and depict her resilient but often shrewd nature. My only comment would have been for the older Chanel, played by Shirley MacClaine, to have had a slight French accent, even if not perfect. Despite this, MacClaine projected the mature Chanel character quite well through her mannerisms.

Would still love to see a film/movie produced that captures Chanel's life and liaisons during and after World War II up to her death.  This could have easily been accomplished in this film by cutting a few non-essential scenes and adding a few others.  All I can say is I truly loved this film!  I think it's pretty close to factual.",1382832000,2,1028,4.879310344827586

Just a note:  If anyone hasn't seen her in ""Some Came Running"" (a 1958 classic), you have got to see it.  Her performance is outstanding!  My favorite part is where she sings, when she, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Carmen Phillips are at a nightclub... her character's singing is classic! :D",1364860800,,350,4.88135593220339

3862954,5,B00279MJHE,Shirley MacLaine did a suburb acting as Coco.  I watch one movie of Coco and rate this one as the one to watch,1353628800,,110,3.782608695652174
3862955,5,B00279MJHE,"Really enjoyed the movie with Shirley MacClaine as Coco Chanel. The way that the movie went back and forth from one era to another was well done and the young Coco was a good choice to play for the characterization of Shirley. They got it right. However, it focused pretty much on her love life rather that her fashion and perfume empire.",1353542400,,338,4.467741935483871

3862959,5,B00279MJHE,"The life of Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel, later known as Coco Chanel, is told as a child who becomes an orphan and then as an adult meets her first love Etienne Balsan and later her greatest love of all, Captain Boy Chapel, who helped her get started in her own business of making hats, becoming a fashion designer and ultimately the world's most famous Eau de Parfum, Chanel No. 5.

 Barbora Bobulova as ""Coco Chanel"" as a young woman. Shirley MacLaine as the older ""Coco Chanel"". Sagamore Stevenin as ""Etienne Balsan"", Olivier Sitruk as ""Captain Boy Chapel"".

 Also in the cast: Valentina Mezzacappa, Malcolm McDowell, Francesca Cavallin, Brigitte Boucher, Emilie Caillon, Alice Cambournac, Jean-Claude Dreyfus.

 The television-movie has an excellent cast, but for me, it was French actor, Olivier Sitruk who was perfectly cast as ""Boy Chapel"". He made this love story worth while to watch.

 It was Shirley MacLaine as ""Coco Chanel"" that attracted me to this movie.

3862963,4,B00279MJHE,"A lovely movie, filmed in Paris, at the seaside town of Deauville, and at a chateau near Paris.  Vintage automobiles.  The surprise of a charming French star, unknown to English language audiences, as Coco's special friend and lover, is OLIVIER SITRUK.  This is his first English language movie and I loved the sizzlingly passionate tango he does with young Coco in Deauville!  He is The Star of this movie.  His voice is dubbed but you can hear his real voice in the Behind the Scenes segment.  I expected more accurate costuming but they are a Hollywood take on Chanel designs.  In the last scene Shirley McLane's ill-fitting suit is a shame, a couturier would not make such an ill-fitting outfit.  Since the suits were not made like Chanel did, hers did not fit properly.  Chanel did not have princess seams in her jackets and she stitched the linings into the top fabric, quilt style, which you can see were not done in the glimpses of the last fashion show.  Four stars because of the poor costuming, otherwise a wonderful love story.",1316649600,2,1039,4.69060773480663

3862966,4,B00279MJHE,"Shirley Maclaine is divine as the older version of Coco Chanel, a French fashion designer, in a male dominated industry who was a female pioneer of sorts. She was ambitious, determined, and motivated but a genius as well. This film version is a fine example of her history as a fashion designer from an orphanage to working for a seamstress to her own shop and the pitfalls along the way. Coco did everything she could to be independent, successful, and artistic in her own way. This movie is a tribute to her legacy as well as a biography.

My only complaint about the DVD is not enough information about Coco Chanel. While the acting and the film is fine itself, it would have been nice to have a biography or more information about Coco's life in the special features section. They only showed about five minutes of behind the scenes of the film.",1304985600,,849,4.549019607843137
3862967,5,B00279MJHE,I have seen both this movie and Coco Before Chanel and this movie is definitely the stand out of the two. This movie has much more emotion in the character of Coco and a true love story as the main plot. Intriguing and interesting Coco's raise to riches as a top fashion designer with the trials and tribulations of the loves of her life.

3862969,1,B00279MJHE,"I was so looking forward to this movie and adding it to my collection of artist biopics. When will America learn that movies about foreign personalities or stories are best done in their  native language and with actors from that country or who at least speak the language??? I don't know what they were thinking when they cast Shirley MacLaine as Coco Chanel and Malcolm MacDowell (who always plays Malcolm MacDowell).  Another travesty was doing Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" in English (though I must admit I loved their casting of Xavier Bardem)!!! All the effort that went into the beautiful filming of the movie in Colombia; hearing it in English was such a major let-down. Look at how successful Edith Piaf's story ""La Vie en Rose"" with French actors was---and how authentic it felt. ""Maria Full of Grace"" was done in Spanish in Colombia with native actors and that too was an amazing movie with a true feeling of authenticity. A few other awesome movies not done in English that portray an air of authenticity: ""Defiance"", ""Apocalypto"", ""The Passion of the Christ"", ""The Stoning of Zoraya"".",1299196800,,1123,4.87434554973822
3862970,3,B00279MJHE,"This happens when trying to portray a very famous, creative, historical figures.  And I think the cast is wonderful and tried their best but maybe what happens is the actors have so much reverence for the character, they seem to loose sight of the fact that they were also human, had bad habits, drank/smoke too much, swear, are moody, smell, burp all the disgusting things people do/and are, but put together in the right order can come up smelling like a rose.  If you follow my train of thought. I liked the movie with Audrey Tatou as Coco better, maybe because she's French and understands the character better, not take away from the actors in this film who I thought did a good job but just didn't quite pull it off.",1297814400,,722,4.5038167938931295

3862972,4,B00279MJHE,"COCO CHANEL is a well-made film whose few flaws unfortunately detract from the enjoyment of what seems to be a rather firm biography of one of the great inventive minds of the 20th century. Though all publicity (and nominations for awards) focused on Shirley MacLaine who appears only periodically and for very brief amounts of time, the starts of the cast are a number of European actors, some strong, others, only medium strong.  And while the real contribution Coco Chanel made to the world was her instatement of the equality of women, changing the manner in which they dressed (read fashionable) from corseted and plumaged mannequins to comfortably mobile and real personas, the writers of this version her life (Carla Giulia Casalini and James Carrington) elected to stress the women whose ability to adjust to being  repeatedly deserted/used by men and turn this movie into a romance decorated by fashion.  And even that idea, valid though it may be, is fairly well buried by a musical score that is so loud as to cover the dialogue - and the dialogue is in some nearly indecipherable language, a mixture of accents and lack of projection on the part of the actors who play more to the sets and costumes than to the audience.

Christian Duguay directs, electing to begin his story with the unhappy childhood of Gabrielle/Coco and Adrienne Chanel, orphans laced in a Catholic sweatshop to make clothes. These episodes of childhood to old age are well transitioned by a black and white, old movie film transfer that does add to the feeling of history.  The girls grow into young women, Coco (Barbora Bobulova) goes to live with Etienne Balsan (Sagamore Stvenin), falls in love, faces the fact that her time with Etienne will be transitory, moves on to Paris where she struggles to make a living making hats until Boy Capel (Olivier Sitruk) becomes her benefactor and lover.  But Boy leaves for the Front as a soldier for the French army, leaving Coco in Deauville to set up shop with the aid of her sister Adrienne (Valentina Lodovin).  The back and forth aspects of the story show Coco in the 1950s (as Shirley MacLaine) making her comeback with the aid of her faithful manager Marc Bouchier (Malcolm MacDowell) and the film ends in a standing ovation for the woman who not only survived but who changed the world of fashion and feminism forever.

There are many other characters in the film who play important parts but they all look alike and have such heavy accents that keeping track of them is almost impossible.  No subtitles are supplied: subtitles would enhance this film immeasurably! Fabrizio Lucci does wonders with the cinematic adaptation of the times frames of the piece, but composer Andrea Guerra (in a slushy replay of Tchaikovsky symphony themes) buries the lines of the actors and nearly destroys what is in essence a very good film.

3862973,2,B00279MJHE,"I love fashion. Need less to say...i love shoes! What woman doesn't, right? For the more of us who cant afford brand names like Chanel, Versace, Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci, Prada and Coach to name a few, the chances of owning an ORIGINAL piece of a collection is well, pretty slim. But we all hope (most of us at least) to become powerful business people when we grow older, and we know that at some point in our lives we will be able to say ""I own an original..."".  Behind every design there is of course a designer, but behind every designer, there is a story. I don't know about the rest of you but I love learning about where and how important people came to be. Because not all of them were born into privileges.

Yesterday for example, I was watching a movie called ""Coco Chanel"" and it was of course because of its title, the biography of the world renowned woman's fashion designer Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel, ( I bet you didn't know her name was Gabrielle hehe). I chose to watch the 2008 version in which starred legendary actress Shirley McLaine as the older Coco. Chanel was French...and Shirley is well...American. That was the first fault. The movie started off promising a good over view of Chanel's early childhood... but then came the blunders... After watching the movie i read up her entire biography and of those who were the main cast in the movie. For starters, the people who were supposed to be french, weren't, and their take on a french accent was horrid. The woman cast as Coco in her teen and later years was beautiful, she looked like Coco herself but the actress tried so hard to think about having a french accent (she is Slovenian) that she forgot how to act... There were some major changes in the movie, i guess to keep the audience interested but it was just too long. The France we all know wasn't the France in the movie... You can most definitely notice that the movie was based on a staged set, obviously not the scenes that took place outside or at the beach.

Knowing that Miss Chanel had to sacrifice so much in the process of starting her own business, makes one think that anything is possible and to never give up. But the movie focuses too much on the personal notes in which they didn't capture very well either. Another thing that bugged me about this movie was the voice over work. In case you didn't know, after a movie is done, actors go into a sound booth, kind of like if they were voicing a cartoon character, but in this case they are just repeating their dialogue from the movie. Some you don't even notice, but in some movies you can see that when you think the actor is saying something he really isn't and then the director notices and asks the actor to record the dialogue in the sound booth. In the Chanel movie, the voice over work was beyond horrible. You could tell that the actor's voice wasn't in tune with how they would say it while filming. Especially the character of Addriene. In the movie she is Coco's best friend, (in real life she was her aunt); as her biography says, Addriene had a deep voice, maybe in the 1940's woman had to chirp instead of talk LOL. But you could tell that the voice that came out of the actresses mouth, wasn't hers. The person who did the voice over spoke with no passion in her voice, she made up a horrible french accent and well it just wasn't a voice for that actress.

The other actors did voice over work too, and sometimes they would speak slower than the actor was speaking, so yeah, pretty bad.

Over all the movie disappointed me. I spent 2 hours waiting for some excitement. The only moment I felt sorry for her was when the love of Chanel's life, Boy Capel was killed in an accident. And I felt sorry for Chanel, not by the way she was portrayed. The biography Wikipedia has on her is way more exciting to be honest.

All i can say is she smoked a lot, but i mean a lot! and that her rise to fame took a lot of sacrifice, hard work, dedication and strength. I admire her as a woman because she never gave up and because she showed women that we don't have to dress how somebody else wants us to, but that we should dress how we feel.

I hope my review wasn't too critical, I am no expert, but it is just a point of view which I hope people take into consideration.",1282435200,,4272,4.339173967459324
3862974,3,B00279MJHE,This movie is long (over 2 hours).  The very beginning is about her life and how the brand came about. I read about her in wikipedia and realized there is a lot about this woman's life that isn't in this movie.  I thought that the move was slow placed and could have been condensed. They showed a lot of the same scenes 3-4 times. Wasting the viewers time while adding filler to make it longer.,1278028800,2,394,4.24
3862975,2,B00279MJHE,"Coco Chanel has become a pretty popular subject for biopics in the last few years, and the first of them was the TV movie ""Coco Chanel,"" which traces the legendary designer's rise from poverty to worldwide fame. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't do her justice -- it focuses more on Chanel's love affairs than her life as a businesswoman, and painstakingly whitewashes her personality.

It opens in the post-WWII period, when Coco Chanel (Shirley MacLaine) is attempting to stage a comeback as a dress designer, which sets her to thinking about the past. As a young girl (Barbora Bobulova) was abandoned by her father, raised by nuns, and plucked from a tiny tailor's shop by the wealthy playboy Etienne, who installed her in a country estate as his mistress.

During her time in the countryside, she became acquainted with the English polo player Boy Capel, who encouraged her when she became making hats -- and funded a hat shop after she left Etienne. Of course, she and Boy eventually ended up lovers, but their passionate affair was interrupted when World War I broke out. While Boy fought in the trenches, Coco expanded her business to include jersey clothes tailored for women's comfort -- which launched her into fame and fortune, but of course romantic problems ensued.

""Coco Chanel"" was released by the Lifetime Channel, and it doesn't surprise me. We've got a woman succeeding despite some cliche sexism, rotten men who done her wrong, melodramatic tragedy, soppy sentimentality and lots of love-life stuff. In fact, ""Chanel the designer"" takes backseat to ""Chanel the naive romantic with extreme daddy issues.""

And it painstakingly whitewashes the seedier aspects of Chanel's life -- her life as a professional mistress is depicted as being purely based on LUVLUVLUV, and her involvement with the Nazis is completely ignored.

Christian Duguay does a decent job as a director when he simply sticks to telling a life story, such as showing Chanel's growing success as a designer and her increasingly hardened personality. But when he tries more dramatic tacks (the whole ""tango"" scene), it ends up being insanely cheesy. I ended up giggling through the entire ""white scarf"" scene after a fatal car accident, because it was so horrendously mawkish.

The acting (not to mention the French accents) are a mixed bag as well. Barbora Bobulova is excellent as the young Chanel -- she's chic, striking and a very good actress, and manages to make you feel for Chanel despite her painful naivete. And there are some good supporting work by Olivier Sitruk and Valentina Lodovini. Too bad MacLaine sleepwalks through her role as ""old Chanel,"" which mostly involves fighting with Malcolm MacDowell and grinding out complaints in a gravelly monotone.

""Coco Chanel"" spends more time on the designer's love life than her life as an individual, and whitewashes anything that isn't pretty. Bobulova is excellent as Chanel, and it's too bad she couldn't have played her in a better movie.",1276646400,25,2985,5.0425963488843815
3862976,5,B00279MJHE,i first saw this movie on lifetime and two days later i was looking for it on line! sooo happy when i found it was going to be relesed on dvd. shirley maclaine not having an accent lame but besides that the movie is great.,1275868800,,222,3.9555555555555557

3862978,3,B00279MJHE,"This is an entertaining and beautifully produced film, perhaps not as factual as ""Coco Before Chanel"" and obviosly this DVD left out some scenes that could have helped to clarify certain points, such as who was Julia (In real life it was her older sister who remained in the orphanage, but how will you know if you haven't read Chanel's bio?) ) and who is that niece suppose to be? Adrienne's daughter? But Adrienne was not her sister, but her aunt (Her mother's youngest sister). And who is the baby that in one scene the Coco character takes to the orphanage?
All this I'm willing to overlook, after all, this is a Hollywood product. What really bothered me was that the movie is advertised as having English subtitles, but they are nowhere to be found, and they are necessary in many scenes because the accent of the actress who played young Coco at times couldn't be understood no matter how many times you went back trying to figure out what she said.
Although I never bought Shirley McLaine as a French woman and the arbiter of French Fashion, she did a good job as usual.
All together, it's worth watching for the scenery and photography,and for those interested in fashion, the final fashion show at the end of the film was quite impressive.",1272153600,23,1249,4.605381165919282

Then I watched the film and for the first time, I was introduced to CoCo...the amazing woman behind the name, behind the fabric I so longed for, behind the brand. To my delight and surprise, she was even MORE captivating then her namesake. Her story a tragically romantic one. It's the story you long to watch without knowing the title of the film: this is it. What an absolutely fabulous tribute to such a phenomenal, strong, icon of our time. I can't believe I had never heard her story before watching this.

And just in case you're wondering, this one is worth buying because you'll want to revisit her story, her romance, her struggles and triumphs again and again.",1264809600,,784,4.52112676056338
3862983,4,B00279MJHE,"If you want to travel to another era and get a full introduction to the
world of fashion, here's a great way to do it.

Even if it is a melodrama, it's so well made, with such obsession with
detail, refinement, (as Chanel's works, by the way) that you can't but
fall for Coco's challenges. And yet it doesn't shy away from her daily
struggles. As a business student, I couldn't help noticing how often
she was verging on bankruptcy, and how she came out of it with a
mixture of audacity, being at the right places and yes, bedding rich
gentlemen ""above her station"" as a Victorian would put it.

Music is fine, as is of course, wardrobe and photography. Being from
Argentina, I found a happy curiosity that there are a couple of tangos
and Argentina is mentioned twice, as a ""land of hope"". The first
company mentioned on the titles that produced this film is called
""Pampa"", I suppose it must have something to do with it.

Barbora Bobulova is stunning as young Coc. Probably more likable
besides more beautiful than Audrieu Tatou, with which obviously one is
drawn to compare it all the time. Both are fine, probably ""Coc avant
Chanel"" emphasizes the sad and grim aspects more, whereas this version,
being longer, can indulge into more romance and yet show us, for
instance, what happened to her beloved sister, something absent from
the feature film. Also in this version we see the origin of the famous
perfume N 5 and her famous ""little black dress"". tienne Balsan and Boy
Capel are totally different in both films. So much they almost look
like if one of the two films got it all wrong. tienne in particular is
always amiable and respectful to Coc here, whereas on ""avant Chanel""
Poelvoorde makes a perfect ""good for nothing spoilt boy who never grew
up"". Boy is also given much more screen time and importance here.
Emilienne d'Alencon is barely shown here, and the game of differences
could go on and on. I suppose purists and people who really know the
real story will love one story and hate the other. But for us newbies
both are surprisingly enjoyable. I understand Mc Laine got all the
prizes but in my opinion Boulova should have got them.

My ""favourite little moment"" is how the beautiful countess who lost
everything becomes her shrewd ""royal secretary"", even suggesting her
it'd be advantageous for Coc for ""everybody loves nobility. Specially
in a republic"". I suppose it's a worthy lesson on how money matters are
fleeting indeed. I could only wonder, if this is a TV series, what
would they have made were they given the ample resources of a feature
film...",1262649600,2,2578,4.634573304157549

Coco's love life was tragic as she let her pride get in the way of her love.....like many of us do! But  it all added up to make Coco who she was, is. This is  very enjoyable movie that lets us share with Coco her life.
I even enjoyed Shirley Maclaine in her advancing years.  She is a master at any role she plays, and as I am an Elderly woman, I loved her style and design.  Coco was not a softie!!

I had seen it on television a few times but only got to see part of it each time. So that's why I bought the DVD.,1254182400,11,277,3.711864406779661
3862993,5,B00279MJHE,"Absolutely loved this movie - One of my all time favorite films!
Love the mix of fashion, romance, and struggle.  Will watch it over and over. The actress who played Coco for most of the movie did an exceptional job.",1253491200,6,216,4.4
3862994,5,B00279MJHE,"Great bio, Mc Claine is tart and moving as the aging Coco.  Fascinating early life of an independent smart woman.  Of course Chanel went on re-inventing her past but still always a rags-to-riches epic.",1252886400,2,201,4.882352941176471
3862995,3,B00279MJHE,"I really like this film. However, why did they get an actress with a French accent? Not Shirley!!!! She was terrible in the film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The french part of the film with the young actress made the film!!!! It is worth seeing despite this Coco Chanel version has a ""hick"" acccent thanks for Shirley. Just bad casting!!! I don't care how amazing she is, this was not her film!!!!!",1252195200,,390,4.75

8354297,5,B00279MJHE,Very fast transaction.  However the movie has no close caption so I am unable to really watch it.  I am hard of hearing and rely on the words being on the screen.  I thought all movies have close caption.  Apparently not.,1525824000,,221,4.317073170731708
