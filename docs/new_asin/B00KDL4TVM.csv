6422064,5,B00KDL4TVM,"...for a program whose complexity assumes rather than insults your intelligence. By necessity, both the story and the motives of the characters unfold gradually. Your grasp of detail and your imagination will be challenged in each episode.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is phenomenal, and the performances by Stephen Rea and Katherine Parkinson (Doc Martin) are eye-opening.

This is one of the better things I've encountered on DVD. Pure pleasure.",1414886400,16,437,5.507462686567164
6422065,5,B00KDL4TVM,"This is an excellent series in every way. I bought this on a whim at target just based on the description, and I was not disappointed.

Many people might find it a bit slow, but I found the pace to be refreshing, and with only 8 episodes it never feels like it's dragging too long.  We here in the states have become so used to constant action and huge cliffhangers that it is expectes, and that's a shame. This has action and cliffhangers, but it is much more subtle which allows the plot to take center stage.

Speaking of plot, that is where this show shines. It presents information over time. The first couple episodes will leave you a little confused because you are missing crucial info. However, things start to come together by the third episode.  I love this! Too many TV shows are dumbed down to accommodate our ever decreasing attention span. Just watch the average procedural on American network television, and you'll know what I mean. They put all the info out front and remind us of it every 10 minutes. Not here. This is a thinking man's show. You will have to pay attention.

The acting is great all around especially Maggie Gyllenhaal in the lead. In addition, pretty much all of the characters are fleshed out. There are very few one dimensional characters.

The amount of episodes is about right. Again, this sets it apart from most US shows. The cable networks are starting to realize that you should let the story dictate the number of episodes not vice versa. Serialized shows like this just tend to fall apart when forced to do 20+ episodes. They have always understood this overseas.

So, get this now is what I'm trying to say. I wish we had more shows like this here.",1413849600,40,1695,4.537704918032787

Yes, it's slow, but it doesn't create tension or build any suspense - unlike Alec Guinness' portrayal of George Smiley.  Clearly the BBC made out like a bandit by co-producing this series with American money from Sundance Channel.  What a waste of talent and money.

6422069,4,B00KDL4TVM,"My wife and I were desperately looking for a new series to satiate our ""Homeland"" withdrawal. ""Honorable"" is simply not as engaging; however, it's worthwhile and does grow on you- gradually... at times painstakingly. It never was boring to either of us- likely because the acting, the wonderful filming, and the excellent musical score keep you watching. The subject matter is very relevant for today, regardless of whether you find the drama to be more politically correct than accurate. We didn't find it to be too heavy handed. As in any series with personal and political secrets, there are some subplots which are more compelling than others. There are any number of ""clues"" and ""events"" which you will eventually need to piece together, and that's part of the fun of this series. Occasionally, there are events which simply seem dumb, but these are few and far between. One such example is the kidnapping which takes place at the end of the first episode. The security was laughable and with such a high profile family, that makes it unbelievable and silly.
...Maggie Gyllenhaal is fantastic as is the rest of the cast! One final compliment- this show simply feels different- the way it is shot, the slower pacing, the musical score and the initial complexity of characters make it so. The director has put together the right ingredients for an intriguing and entertaining series.",1409616000,34,1386,4.952789699570816
6422070,3,B00KDL4TVM,"Most of the following was written as the serial was being broadcast and describes my experience of the drama as the story was unfolding. My feelings about the way the plot was handled were altered to some extent by the very last episode. Some people may find it useful, if they are put off watching after seeing just the first few episodes, if it then encourages them to persevere. But is it worth persevering? Perhaps it depends on whether you have an interest in the current state of TV drama or need to know what TV drama is saying about the Palestine problem.

Perhaps surprisingly in the case of a drama that is being aimed at an intelligent audience, there is plenty of evidence of the 'Beat Sheet' in the gratuitously violent and mechanically contrived finales signaled in advance by the ratcheting up of tension towards the end of each episode. The trouble is they are not very credible if some critical common sense is applied to the circumstances in which these violent episodes occur and are too obviously there to 'excite' the audience - except in the case of the first episode which was necessary to get the plot going. After that none of the extreme violence was necessary, or convincing on the level of a well crafted plot. Indeed it was either so lamely contrived (the murder of Bloom the bodyguard); or so cliched (the murder of the whistleblower Professor) or so unconvincingly straining to pile 'ingenious' twist on twist (the murder of the phony ex-mistress of the Palestinian contractor in episode 2); or just the extra corpses thrown in picturesquely at the end of episodes ( shown from above, tastefully arranged among vegetables on a cart; on the back of a small truck in a wide landscape; in close-up spread on the familiar sofa from which we've never seen him rise) that all this violence was insulting to the better half of the audience, as well of course as being intensely unpleasant where it wasn't just tasteless (the cart, truck and sofa images). But to be quite clear, my primary objection is that these events are not integral to the plot and so the reason for them being there is all too obvious.

It was of course David Hare who complained that the body count in television drama was much too high for believability and he wrote a three part political conspiracy drama shown recently to prove that it didn't need that to engage an intelligent audience. Unfortunately the usual commercial need to excite a mass audience means that lots of violence now has to be bolted on clumsily to every kind of production where possible. There is no censorship or self restraint to hold this back as far as I can see from the sort of examples I have come across, many far worse than here. This can only get worse after the huge popular success of Game Of Thrones which clearly pulled in the audience figures largely for this reason.

The formula, giving special prominence to the art direction, seems to have been arrived at because of the success of 'Breaking Bad' in which the art direction was the most impressive feature, and the structure of the plot was obviously closely determined by the commercially tested Beat Sheet (on audiences of AVERAGE intelligence by definition).
But Hugo Blick of course can always claim that he had tested the other formalistic and formulaic aspects of the plot in his previous TV serial 'Shadow Line' which also had plenty of gratuitous violence as well as the almost continuous threat of violence guaranteed by the presence of an unpredictable and  dangerous psychopath as one of the main characters (Rafe Spall gave the scariest performance I have ever seen) . Unfortunately Blick neglected to ensure that the plot had adequate motivation especially for one of the main central characters Joseph Bede (Christopher Eccleston) with whom the audience was meant to sympathise - especially after Blick had killed off the only character who had the makings of a conventional hero in the third episode. Sound familiar? Yes, of course, he did exactly the same thing in 'An Honourable Women'.
But this style of highly aestheticised art direction/cinematography does not sit well with the realistic violence in a realistic context. The art direction in Breaking Bad on the other hand tended heavily towards defamiliarization, and even the surreal, especially in the opening sequences, and it worked very well in the context of that serial which was essentially a kind of black comedy or, again, a pastiche of Jacobean tragedy.

So what we end up with is an overcomplicated, inflated and padded-out story presented in two incongruous narrative styles or cinematic idioms appealing to very different audiences. The padding is particularly noticeable in all the scenes involving the MI6 man, played by Stephen Rae, which are ponderous, conspicuously mystifying and ultimately pretentious especially when his scenes even involve an ongoing slow game of chess, taking these effects to the furthest possible extreme. This kind of thing can work in a novel but the new concept of the 'television novel' is surely not intended to be such a material or literal transfer of one medium into another. This character even has his own domestic sub-plot which would be a routine way of building up a background for a character in a novel but do we really need it in a serial? - unless it's one of those setups intended to run for several seasons rather like a soap opera.

Eight hours are definitely more than this deserves. It could easily have been no more than four if we lost Ephra's domestic difficulties, Stephen Rae's personal sub-plot, his unproductive meetings with his Israeli contact, if the superfluous violence had been left out, and if Rae and Gyllenhaal had been directed to speed up a bit. I blame Hugo Blick entirely for the pace of Rae's scenes for obvious reasons, though it isn't so clear in the less problematic case of Nessa whose English accent may only work on the Margaret Thatcher model and for which she may be excused.
But how was it that Blick was allowed to inflate this to this length. In eight hours I would expect something like the TV equivalent of 'War and Peace', 'Dr Zhivago', or 'The Brothers Karamazov' especially with this kind of art direction. Apparently Blick has his own production company but he still has to get screening time from the BBC. Maybe they thought it would be the ideal filler for the dead time summer schedule when half the country is on holiday.
Eight hours is what 'The Devil's Whore' deserved but it only got four - and that for a story, the content of which defined it as an epic of the English Civil War.

The 6th episode was more interesting in some ways, especially as regards Schlomo who is by far the most interesting character, but Ephra's wife is really getting on my nerves, and it seems even more explicit that all the good people speak extre..ee..mly slo..wly; and whe...n... tw...o o..f the...m ge..t to.ge..ther, we...ll....

Last episode - rather good, to my surprise, with what looked superficially like satisfactory dramatic resolutions - mainly delivered in the form of three dialogues: first a very direct and honest one between Nessa and Atika, all pretenses dropped; then more importantly a confrontation between Nessa and the Jewish/Palestinian boy's grandfather who is revealed as the 'OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN'; finally a scene involving Atika and the same, leading to Atika  becoming 'the honourable woman' for the high action finale.
In view of the intended reference to the ASSASSINS this might arguably go some way, in retrospect, towards offering some justification for the very high body count all the way to the end. But, does it account for all the killings, or justify the way they were presented. Isn't it something of an illusion based on the short memory of the viewers? Weren't some of the killings ordered by Monica Chatwin, the other villain, and carried out by those directly under her control. Is she one of Fatah's assassins??? No, she has a different agenda. But on the other hand why didn't one of her agents kill the bodyguard Bloom? It seems odd that the first thing that the man from Gazza does is to go after him, especially as he goes about it in such a roundabout way. This sort of fuzziness I find annoying. Another fuzziness remains around Atika's part in the original kidnapping in Gaza (in which the Palestinian driver was killed) and what she thought she was doing then and afterwards.

Anyway although the emphasis on killings throughout this serial may in some part be justified by the finally revealed motive of REVENGE according to the old medieval code of the 'Old Man Of The Mountain' it doesn't justify the emphasis on elegant or beautiful art direction or the other self indulgent aspects of this serial which led to it taking 8 hours of my life in exchange for just one reasonably satisfying dramatic exchange which was satisfying more for its context than its actual content.",1408838400,6,8936,4.823222439660796
6422071,4,B00KDL4TVM,"In the first few episodes of this thriller, the action proceeds slowly; however this is a deliberate technique that
not only builds up tension - nothing is quite what it seems - but also indicates the complexity of the issues tackled
in this series. While Nessa Stein (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her brother Ephra (Andrew Buchan) appear philanthropic on the surface, using their wealth to foster better relationships between the Israelis and the Palestinians - they are also involved in underhand schemes, none of which are overtly revealed in the opening episodes. Instead director/writer Hugo Blick uses a montage technique comprised of short scenes which might appear meaningless in themselves, but which cumulatively build up a
picture of the Stein family's way of life in the present as well as the past. It is the viewers' responsibility to put these pieces of
information together and try and work out what is going on. This task is often difficult, as Blick brings in characters who superficially
seem to have nothing to do with the main plot-lines. It is only later on - in subsequent episodes - that we discover what their role in the overall story actually is. This technique draws attention to the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where it is often
very difficult to identify who one's allies or one's enemies actually are. People have to be taken at face value, until one gets to know
them. THE HONOURABLE WOMAN takes a bit of time to get going, but by the fourth episode it has gained in momentum, not only explaining the Stein family's shady past, but showing how the British security forces, led by Julia Walsh (Janet McTeer) and Hugo Hayden-Hoyle (Stephen Rea) have to get their hands morally dirty in order to make sense of what they are doing. There are no heroes or villains in this world; the most successful people are those who know how to play the system by forging
and re-forging alliances, as well as exploiting others for personal gain. Viewers need to be a little patient with this series; if they do
so, they will be amply rewarded.",1406678400,64,2074,4.845070422535211

Unfortunately there are any number of problems; suicides, kidnappings, murders and intrigues beyond counting. Nessa seeks to negotiate her way through this complex situation with ever increasing stakes.
This is a complex and confronting drama. There are very strong scenes involving violence and sex. Many of the characters are conflicted and the choosing of allies is fraught. It is all superbly conveyed. The horror and deadliness of the disputed territories and the blighted people there is graphic and wrenching. The machinations of the various security forces is chilling. This is gripping drama. The cast is excellent and the scripting is tight. There are twists and tension galore.

6422075,2,B00KDL4TVM,"There is a lot to recommend about ""The Honourable Woman"" - the lead characters are almost all female, and Maggie Gyllenhall puts in an incredible performance as the title character. But there is just so much to object to, and so many times you roll your eyes to the heavens and just want this miniseries to end.(Janet McTeer's line about being the only one in a room full of pussies with a vagina was particularly cringe worthy)

 SPOILERS

Wanting to be head of MI6 was the motivation behind Monica Chatwin's extensive conspiracy? With her powers of manipulation, she could have ruled the world - I know the British refuse to believe their Empire is truly gone, but surely a woman with such capabilities would have set her sites far higher.

Why on Earth would Nessa Stein tearfully accept the responsibility of all the horrible things that happened to her - ""I deserved it!"" How? Your father is murdered in front of you, your stupid brother won't tell you what he's doing, which leads you into a trap when researching the missing funds, not to mention the betrayals and the crime that happens to you twice! This is the kind of misogynistic crap Latin American literature is all too often riddled with: the woman with the martyr complex. As for the key twist, someone please look up Halakhic law - any child born to a Jewish mother is a Jew, irrespective of the father! (The Old Man of the Mountain seemed to understand this, as he lamented tainting his bloodline, which of course leads one to ask why did he bother, then!)

I wanted to like this series, but the never ending abuse heaped on the title character irritated me. The critics reviews of this series turned my stomach. My favourite was from the Telegraph: ""[Nessa Stein] is a new kind of female protagonist: one not only driving the drama and outwitting the male characters, but looking amazing as she does so"". How patronizing and just plain inaccurate - are the fashion choices of a male character ever lauded? And sadly, Nessa doesn't outwit anyone.",1455321600,2,2014,4.677966101694915

6422087,4,B00KDL4TVM,"This is about as depressing as it is great but that speaks to the power of its vision and the talent that put it together.

Here's the scoop. The Stein Company in Israel, as a measure to lessen the gap between Israel and Palestine, initiates a program to lay optic cable in Palestine to help bring their communications into the 21st century. But the kidnapping of a child, and intelligence operatives crawling all over the place, jeopardize everything.

This is a filthy, ugly, underhanded, double (triple) dealing story that makes one wonder if and how these two countries will ever get it together. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Nessa Stein who has taken the reins of the Stein company from her brother. But why? What is his secret? Then there's the kidnapped child. Who does he really belong to? Then there is a head operative (Stephen Rea) who is trying to unravel this mess while other operatives jockey for his job.

This is extremely well written and directed. It's unbelievably complicated and, as is stated in the opening sequence, ""one wonders who you really can trust."" And that finger points to nearly everyone involved. It gets so ugly you'll want to take a shower when it's over. It is also a very savvy script. It seems to understand the politics of the region all too well. It also seems to understand the positions of other countries (particularly the U.S. and Briton) in their stake in things. The actors all do an outstanding job. Rea is as good as I've ever seen him. He has this hang-dog look of a man who has been doing his job way too long. Gyllenhaal sleeps in a panic room and seems to think she needs to be beat up both physically and mentally for her secret. Her brother Ephra (Andrew Buchan) has his secret and it's at the heart of much of what happens. But...too much blood has been spilled over the decades and eveyrone wants their pound of flesh. It's a sad world.

This is a great series but you need to keep on the ball. If you so much as blink, something important will pass by.",1438128000,,2006,4.533149171270718
6422088,5,B00KDL4TVM,Maggie Gyllenhaal is amazing in her role as Nessa Stein. I won't comment on the series plot because it's far too complicated and another reviewer did an a great job of that. I only wanted to say here that Gyllenhaal is a serious actress that immediately captured my attention and then my empathy. One thing I will say about the series is that it demonstrates that women in the secret services of the world can be as ruthless as any male spy ever was. Made me a little sad actually. If you like a good believable spy story then I highly recommend this one. P.S. I am also now convinced that there is no more privacy anywhere.

Full marks to the cast who all give outstanding performances although having an American actresses play a British Baroness seems a bit odd when there so many talented British actresses who could have done an equally good job.  I usually don't have problems but too often this dialogue was difficult to understand so I had to resort to using subtitles.  There was more gore than necessary; the camera didn't need to linger so long on  the frequently oozing blood -- hence my 4 star rating.,1437004800,,707,4.7073170731707314
6422091,4,B00KDL4TVM,"I enjoyed this superbly-cast eight-hour dramatic series, and it's easy to get caught up in.  On reflection, though, the almost baroque complexity of the plot can make you wonder if it's all not just a bit too clever.  When I think of it in context of other thriller series of international intrigue, like the Smiley series, for example, it seems that the writers have gone out of their way to ramp up the violence, the sex, and the plot complications -- and we get the point that by their doing so, we, the audience, have our noses rubbed in the unreliability of our judgments about people, entities, and institutions.  ALL of them are full of secrets and internal conflicts, and in all of them both ideology and personal ambition drive them to conceal and to work surreptitiously for advantage.  It might seem, given the title, that Nessa Stein (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is the one dependable lodestar of integrity in the movie -- but she has her own secrets and she is driven by a fierce and naive insistence that her company's dealings with both Israel and the Palestinian authorities and businesses in the West Bank and Gaza must be ""uncompromised.""  That's naive in that it fails to recognize that any choices that one makes in such dealings are going to be interpreted as compromising and that one HAS to deal with that.  It's not enough to know that ones own motives were pure.  That doesn't mean, though, that all compromises are equally morally suspect, and what is intriguing about the series is coming to try to develop in ones own mind a kind of scale by which to judge the various compromises.  Can some be labeled simply hypocrisy?  Or is consideration of intention -- which involves the question of on whose behalf beyond ones own one acts -- the most important thing for us to be thinking of?  Can we always sort out the personal from the political intentions?  And should any of the characters have reason to trust others, when the groups that others belong to might take actions that reveal deep divisions within them.

You'll notice that I'm saying little about plot details here, and that's in the interest of avoiding spoilers -- and trust me (!), there's plenty of suspenseful action.  The basic set-up is that Nessa Stein and her brother Ephra run a business involving telecommunications by means of which they hope to improve communications in the Middle East in such a way that Israelis and Palestinians will find it easier to talk with each other and thus lower tensions and improve the prospects for peace.  In addition, Nessa is involved in having her company sponsor educational opportunities for Palestinians and Israelis so that the younger generations will be more able to break out of the cycle of distrust and animosity that marks the older generation.  The question is -- is the older generation too fixated on revenge and the status quo to be amenable to these opportunities, even as it is willing to take the Steins' money?  The Steins are Jewish, and their father was murdered when they were children, so Nessa's determination herself NOT to get caught up in a cycle of revenge seems more than honorable -- it seems saintly almost, and it has won Nessa a seat in the House of Lords no less.  But is she effective?

Nessa wants her company -- and perhaps more, herself -- to be uncompromised.  Her counterpart in seeking effective solutions to the problems that face him is Sir Hugh Hayden-Hoyle (Stephen Rea), the head of the Middle East section of British Intelligence -- but the problems he faces are not problems of seeking peace in the Middle East.  They are more immediate problems caused by Nessa's efforts to do the right things, efforts that cause problems that Nessa doesn't foresee, even if one could argue that she ought to have foreseen at least some of them.  But she's trusting -- even though she likes to see herself as clear-sighted -- and that's a problem in itself.  Hayden-Hoyle is a deeply-compromised man, both personally and professionally . . . but there's a bit of the George Smiley about him, and Rea gives a wonderful performance.  His interactions with his boss, Dame Julia Walsh (Janet McTeer), are marvelous, and his dealings with all the other stakeholders -- the Steins, the Americans, the Palestinians, the Israelis -- are rivetingly played and very well written.

The procedural aspects of the story, and the personal interest we develop in weighing motives and intentions, outweigh any reservations that I had, retrospectively, about the story itself, considered from the point of view of plausibility.  It might be true that no one in the story really knows anyone else, but it becomes clear that there are characters who know themselves and characters who THINK they know themselves, and it all plays out intriguingly.  I've mentioned Rea, Gyllenhaal, and McTeer, but there's a large cast, and they are all excellent in their roles.  I'm not sure that overall the series has the tragic dimensions of, say, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,"" but it's compelling all the same.",1436313600,,5039,4.822299651567945

6422097,4,B00KDL4TVM,"Most one season series are presented in a fashion so as to grab the audience immediately. This is to ""hopefully ""ensure tuning in next week. This series on dvd was presented as an 8 parter. It actually took me a full 2 and part of  the tjhird episode before I was committed and looking forward to the revelations we are promised will come. It was worth that committment. I must assume the production and creative departments felt the need not to overwhelm the audience with the mountain of subplots and characters in the first 90 minutes or else eliminate much of the text. It was a good choice. All of the subplots are tightly brought together by the end of episode 6. The last two episodes are filled with excitement and action as one would expect from a thriller with major political overtones. The subject matter is timely and controversial. Some may feel it a little to one sided in its presentation of such an emotional topic. Our protagonists are just as ruthless as the characters we have early on deemed the bad guys (the ""intelligence agencies"" ). Every player has their own agenda. Some are based on duty to the cause and others are more selfish and egocentric.
The actors are superb. But major kudos to three in particular. Maggie Gyllenhaal who plays a woman determined to find a true beginning in solving the herculean task of Isreali/Palestinian acceptance of each other. Stephen Rea is a British ""intelligence"" agent assigned to the middle east. He is having a crisis of self worth and must decide how he can play the role of gatherer of information for his employer or get involved with the peace process .There doesnt seem to be an inbetween for him. The other very fine performance is that of Igal Naor. His character is a long time friend of this family who now finds themselves in a period of self destruction. He is very convincing at keeping us guessing if he is a loveable friend or a business man with his own agenda. I really loved watching his scenes. Not enough screen time for my tastes. A very perplexing character. The other cast members are also wonderful . They fly in and out of scenes so frequently that you really can not get an accurate feeling on which side of the fence the stand until the end. Just as a good thriller should. And that is exactly what happens with unexpected consequences. There are top rate supporting characters at their best in this series.
To enjoy this series you must make that initial commitment of getting past a slow but informative beginning. The action of a political thriller does come in a thunderous burst but only from episode three on. It is well worth the wait.
On a personal note :: This topic is very emotional for both sides of the main issues. No one film can present a totally objective point of view. I was not watching for greater insight to the problems of the middle east. As we see on the  big and small screens objectivity is lost depending on what a station owners policy is towards this issue. The same applies to films. Our objectivity is clouded by who and how this complex material is presented. I have always tried to be as objective as possible .I have looked at the history of this region and still hope a peaceful solution is possible. I don't feel this series leaves us with that hopefulness. But anything is possible.",1431993600,5,3312,4.574074074074074

6422105,1,B00KDL4TVM,"Look. I've always hated negative reviews that don't critique the actual content... but this, imho, is absolutely warranted. (Negative reviews, especially for this particular series, will gain the most exposure as there will be so few.)

First off, let it be known that this was and remains my favorite television release of last year. Last year we had Fargo. We had True Detective. The Affair. House of Cards. The end of Boardwalk Empire. The best season of Game of Thrones to date (Alex Graves for pres. >.> (inside joke for all you West Wing fans)). The best season of Homeland since the debut season. Mad Men. Masters of Sex. Manh(a)ttan. Rectify. The Game... The list goes on.

^ All of the above, save for the two BBC exports and Rectify, have or will be receiving respectable Blu-ray treatments... Why on God's green earth is this? Another recent one was the 2nd season of the Americans. It received only a DVD after the first season got both... Seriously. I love Swans every bit as much as the next guy, but it's 2015 for crying out loud. (This LUNACY is not at all appreciated.) If you're gonna choose to forgo a format in favor of saving cost, why is it the DVD that's prevailing? -face palm-

I just... I think this show is easily one of the most deserving of the HD treatment... and it infuriates me that the BBC has seen fit to neglect it along with several others.",1429228800,3,1377,4.544354838709677

And that sums up An Honorable Woman extremely well. Its as if the filmmakers asked how they could really and trulyand thoroughlyconfuse viewers from one disconnected scene to the next, and they employed conventional means to accomplish it: flashbacks, flash forwards, flash sideways. To manipulate our emotions, they rely heavily upon music of great sadness or grief. Some of it consists of violins, violas, and cellos, mournfully bowed. Some of it is Middle Eastern wailing or keening. And there are too many moments of directorial preciousness. For example, a chess piece dropped on a table that miraculously lands upright. Surely that's meant to imply something profound, but it comes across as  meaningless and gratuitous.

Whats missing is a graspable sense of story, flow and continuity. Its been hacked up, through editing, into confetti. And the result is confusion. There are too many jack-in-the box surprises, violent or shocking onesas opposed to suspense leading to unpredictable but inevitable outcomes.

6422126,3,B00KDL4TVM,"The Honorable Woman an eight hour English made mini-series premiered first on the BBC and then on the Sundance Channel in July of 2014. Currently, as of January 2015 it can be seen in its entirety on Netflix. It stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and was written, directed and produced by Hugo Blick.

I braced myself for this teleplay, because of the bad experience I had in 2012 when I watched a previous English production of a Jewish/Israel/European topic. The absolute deconstruction of the history of the Israeli Palestinian dispute as seen through Peter Kosminskys eyes in The Promise from 2011, left me untrustworthy of English filmmakers to treat these subjects with reverence. There is a difference between taking some creative license and totally distorting history for a particular political agenda.  So, I was expecting the worst.

To see the review of The Promise click here http://amzn.to/1zwO3F2

Maybe because my standards were set so low, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I found myself intrigued with the smart story line,  plot twists, and the building to the conclusion which was a little disappointing but nevertheless held my attention, and gave me some entertainment for a couple of nights.

The play is about Nessa Stein,(Gyllenhaal) a liberal, nave, idealistic woman whose principles manage to promote the peace between Jews and Arabs, she so desperately drives her corporation to support, farther away rather than closer to reality.

In the end, all the audience can conclude from Nessa Steins efforts, is that hatred in the Middle East will continue no matter how much western goodwill is poured into the Palestinian world. In other words, the fight isn't over financial equality, or equal political terms, or even about land. It is about one side totally dominating the other until it is exterminated. That is what we have been living with since 1948 and a million Nessa Steins will never change that.

Because of my previous disappointments in British television about  the Middle East, I was concerned that director Blicks political leanings might strike a moral equivalency between the two sides.

It does, but I don't fault Blick for creating his story. As far as the made up history, like all other fiction about highly volatile international problems one has to accept the creative license given in telling the tale. And, he does that with a certain amount of expertise. The problem lies in the gullibility of the audience. People not familiar with how things really are in the Middle East tend to see digitized drama on those subjects as truth rather than just a story.

I submit, Oliver Stones 1992, JFK. There are people still walking around thinking that Lyndon Johnson was implicated in Kennedys assassination. A scandalous rumor, completely unfounded, but the director Stones creativity allowed for Johnson to be involved. Johnsons participation since the release of the movie has spawned a cottage industry naming him as a conspirator which distorts the factual history of the crime. I should add that Stone was entirely irresponsible for not ever setting the record straight and that has contributed to the rumor.

Hopefully, Blick realizes more of the power of the medium in which he works and takes the proper steps to let his audience know the reality of Palestinian actions and Israels retaliation for those actions in the actual world we live in.

Blick shows Palestinian terrorists to be thoughtful, soft spoken, courageous if at the same time a little scary, but always gives them a way out to point to the justification of their acts, no matter how heinous. The Israelis on the other hand, are all loud mouth, fat, sneaky , and shiftless, unless they are politically of the left wing and unrepentant with bias against their own country. I wanted to turn down the set every time the actor playing the Israeli ambassador to England was in the scene.  It is an unfair description of the conflict, but, without the fantasy of balancing the moral scales Blick would have been unable to drive his plot.

Palestinian terror is tinged with justification while Israeli actions are seen with contempt and dubious claim.

The brutal, bloody, simply horrifying killing of the patriarch Stein in front of his two small children in the opening scene of the play, we later learn was because Stein industries made its fortune in building armaments for Israel, marking it as the culprit behind Palestinian misery over its defeats to Israel. The audience has an oh well moment when they find that out. No one deserves to die like that but I can certainly understand now why they killed him.

On the other hand, The Samarian Defense League, an Israeli terrorist organization with the moral equivalency of the Islamic Jihad/ Hamas group in Blicks imaginary world, is a totally fictional creation.  This creates for Blick the right kind of push pull tension that a spy thriller like this needs to succeed but  is also an overt description Palestinians have been accusing Israel of since the end of the Six Day War in 1967. Even the murder of Jews is not beyond them, something not even Blicks apparent model for the group,  the Stern Gang of the 1940s has been accused of.
The Samarian Defense League is Blicks  Oliver Stones LBJ assertion in JFK. He has a responsibility to make clear that this is a fictional account and bears no similarity to any reality in the Middle East today.

Another scene at a function where CEO Nessa Stein is to sponsor an evening with Palestinian musicians trained with Stein group money, a loud angry protest is apparent as Nessa walks into the building.  Palestinian supporters on one side and Israel supporters on the other yelling at each other separated by only caution tape, would never happen in our real world. In 2015 England is far too dangerous for Jews to protest against any Muslim assertion, least wise, support for the Jewish State.

Still even for someone like myself who knows this history intimately and have naturally raised those issues here, I found the play intelligent, intriguing and very interesting.  I understand the story could not have unfolded the way it did without inventing a world that didn't exist. Unlike the Promise mentioned at the beginning of this review, The Honorable Woman is clearly a figment of a writers mind.

The Honorable woman, is a good spy story. Just remember that it is fiction and bears no similarity to what is happening in our world other than Mr. Blick got the names right, Israel and Palestine.

6422127,5,B00KDL4TVM,"Hugo Blick, an amazing story teller. This is a sprawling story, covering an international conflict, with highly political content, but is also a spy thriller and a family tragedy. The story told in 8 episodes is spellbinding. It is complex with many story lines yet ends rather neatly.
At the center the role a woman entangled in this story is played exceptionally by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who won a Golden Globe for this role.
But al the players are very, very good. Hugo Blick, whose resume in film/TV making is very short is an amazing talent. He also wrote and directed a crime saga, ""The Shadow Line"" which is also exceptional.. Mention neats to be made for a very good Stephen Rea. Highly recommended.",1422662400,2,704,4.7317073170731705
6422128,5,B00KDL4TVM,"Stunning, beautifully made 8 hour mini-series that attempts to humanize a situation as impossibly knotty as the middle east, and against all odds, succeeds. The biggest triumph here is by writer/director/producer Hugo Blick, who creates an amazingly dense and cinematic landscape of characters and tragedies.

Nessa Stein (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a tremendously wealthy Israeli determined to use her wealth and influence to try and bring together Israelis and Palestinians. Her father  assassinated before her eyes as a child  was an arms merchant amassing a huge fortune, but at a human cost Nessa finds hard to live with. Now, as an adult, along with her brother, she plans to bring the high-speed internet to the Palestinian areas of Israel to help jump start their economy and self-sufficiency.

But, understandably this plan raises hackles and suspicions on both sides and before you know it Nessa's brother's Palestinian housekeeper (and Nessa's friend) has her son kidnapped. Thus begins a complicated, tense, tremendously intelligent and demanding trip down a rabbit hole of lies, secrets, hidden histories, violence, spies and counter-spies and the sadness of watching your ideals hacked to pieces by all those around you.

The series deserves credit for many things, among which is managing not to take sides, but to examine the madness on all sides of living in perpetual war.

The acting is tremendous. Maggie Gyllenhaal cements her position as one of our finest and most versatile actresses. Her Nessa is an admirable if deeply flawed woman. Gyllenhaal deftly melds all the character's sides; absurdly smart, brave, afraid, powerful, hidden, foolish, naive -- into a great tragic heroine. Stephen Rea is endlessly fascinating as a very smart UK spy attempting to uncover the many hidden truths. Quiet yet immensely powerful, watching Rea's Sir Hayden-Hoyle interrogate and manipulate those he interviews is a master class in loaded understatement in performance.

But the whole cast is absolutely first rate; the brilliant and under-appreciated Janet McTeer as Rea's boss, Andrew Buchan as Nessa's brother, Lubna Azbal as the mother of the kidnapped boy, etc.

Just as wonderful is the cinematography, editing and music, combing to create a show that feels stylistically far more like a top flight auteur film than TV. This is challenging, complicated stuff. You will inevitably get lost at times. But have faith Blick and crew will bring you back around if you pay attention. And you'll want to. I greedily watched the 8 hours in 2 days.

My biggest complaint? No US blu-ray so far. For a show this well photographed, that seems downright absurd.

This also lead me to watch Blick's previous BBC mini-series ""The Shadow Line"" -- a tale of police corruption and drug dealing that's almost a complicated and great as ""Honorable Woman"".
