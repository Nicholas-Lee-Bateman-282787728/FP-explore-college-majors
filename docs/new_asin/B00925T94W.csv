8534568,3,B00925T94W,"I have a somewhat different view from that of the other previous reviewers, in fact I will probably not watch the main item on this disc very often.  I do agree with the positive comments about Accademia Barocca and about the technical quality.  In general, I did not enjoy the singing, as it has an overdose of ""UEV"" - ubiquitous excessive vibrato, especially coming from the three Marinas.  I really cannot understand why a director will go to such lengths to maintain authenticity with the orchestral intruments, only to allow this 20th century scourge to filter into the singing.  Not only is it probably not authentic (latest opinion is that vibrato only appeared widely in the late 19th century), but to my ears it sounds awful, and completely spoils my enjoyment of an otherwise beautiful composition.",1424304000,,808,4.919117647058823
8534569,3,B00925T94W,"Il Prigionier Superbo (The Proud Prisoner)(1733) is Pergolesi's second sortie into the staid, rigid, sacred world of Opera Seria. It shows many improvements over his Seria effort Salustra (1732). There is a clearer more directional harmonic planning (he had just completed a lengthy sacred piece about a saint). The arias allow more character development such as Sostrate great aria ""Salda quercia"" at the end of act 1 with it's vivid and stirring imagery and depth of feeling. There is clear flow to his melodies now; pathos becomes sentimental with restraint. At the end of act 2 Rosmene (who is THE noble person in this Seria) has to choose life for either her father or her beloved and the other will be executed. This highly charged scene with its use of bare octaves jumps and intense rhythms  conveys the terror she is feeling. This well constructed music is to me the best in the opera. But there are many excellent sections. Several arias have a martial chracter with use of trumpet. I feel that this writing excels even Vivaldi at his best in the development of Italian Opera.
The libretto is by Francesco Silvani that he called La Fede tradita e vindicata (Faith betrayed and vindicated) with names changed and revised by G.A. Frederico. It was given 5 September 1733 as a celebration of the birthday of the Austrian Empress Elizabeth Christina. (This was to be the last year of Hapsburg rule of Naples and was replaced by the Bourbons of Spain.) Silvano's drama had been given in Naples before in 1707 with music by Gasparini and Vignola. It was received with great acclaim. It was again presented with music by Leonardo Vinci in 1726 under the name of Ernelinda. Again to great enthusiasm. The plot was well known to the Neopolitans but Pergolesi's main presentation was not well received but overshadowed by the comic intermezzo La Serva Padrona also by G.A. Frederico with music by Pergolesi.
History
Silvano's original drama had a character in it named Ricimero. In later scores he is named Metalce. There appears to have been a ""Prigionier"" early in the 1700s in Italy but the score is lost so that the composer of the music is unknown. The story that Silvano used was not original but based on a series of libretti developed in the 17th and 18th centuries. The story actually concerns an historical person Flavius Ricimer, a Roman patrician who was ""magiste militum"" (master of Roman Soldiers) 456-472 c.e. Roman emperors came and went, the Vandels attacked and later Ricimer subdued the city and saved it. His story became an Opera Seria plot in 1684 by a Matteo Noris with music by Pallavicino. Noris added the love affairs to make it more ""operatic"". The revered librettist Zeno took the story, revised it changed its name to Flavio Ancio Oliberio and made it a ""work of art"".  Remember at this time the libretto of the Opera Seria was the great art; the music was incidental. The plot of Flavio was revised by Francesco Silvani and Ricimer(o) is now a Visigothic King Athaulf and the title is changed to La fede tradita e vindicata and as noted above was set to music by Gasperini in 1704. It became Il prigionier superbo of Pergolesi in 1733 and then Ernelinda, Princesse de Norvege by Philador in 1767.
A note about Opera Seria. As was noted in a review of other Pergolesi opera seria, this was an art form conceived in the 17th century soon after the birth of the art form opera in 1599 in Florence. Opera Seria had rules as to number of people (no more than eight), use of chorus (supposed to be prominant but this rule mostly ignored), time period (must be in 24 hours), no killing or suicide, noble people with one acting out the major noble resolution (here it is Rosmene)all of which are set forth in Aristotle's ""Poetics"". Thus the libretto was considered the high art form with the music incidental. This art form flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly in Italy. It was thought of as the high form of music. But its rigid rules were broken and a livlier art form developed in operatic literature. One of the last great composers to write opera seria was Mozart in his Idomeneo and La Clemenza de Tito.
The Production. The best way to enjoy this disc is to leave the video off. The performance is exciting delightful and incredible accurate. The Accademia Barocca de I Virtuosi Italiani with the conductor Corrado Rovaris is a joy to hear. They have pep, drive and eloquence. I would love to hear a whole evening of them in concert. With modern technology and the Blu-ray disc every nuance of the lute and theorboe is made clear.
The singers are all excellent, they act as well as sing this very difficult and complicated score. We have a surfeit of Marina; three Marinas in a cast of six. Marina de Liso gets special mention as she has so much to do. She is the central character as King of the Goths, Metalce(hense her horrible costume) and is in the original score a soprano(alto) in travesti, the Viridate, King of Denmark here played by Marina Comparato and Micisda, the King of Bohemia played by Giacinta Nicotra were originally castrati. Metalce really runs the show. No more so than when she is badgering Rosmene to become his(her) wife. Rosmene is another Marina, Marina Rodriguez Cusi. She is excellent in her dramatic put downs of Metalce. Her aria that ends Act 2 is heart rending.
The only man (a tenor) in the show is Sostrate as performed by Antinio Lozano. His portrayal of the dispairing, defeated king at the end of act 1 was most moving.
The stage director is Henning Brockhaus. He has directed a long list of operas, I hope better than this one, On an already complicated plot characteristic of Opera Seria, he has added many other layers of complexity. But to what purpose? I have always assumed that what the director was supposed to do was direct the composition to the audience, to clarify it, to enlighten it. Not here, he seems to wish to divert your attention from the Pergolesi opera to himself. So we are confused by the cave, the silly marionettes, all the girls playing men's parts, the wheelchair etc. etc. NO! It is better to hear the very beautiful music with the video off.
La Serva Padrona was a most amusing and enjoyable (in fact my only previous encounter with Pergolesi) vehicle for Roberta Peters when I saw it in the 1950s. It had verve and sparkle. The performance on this disc has neither.
I wish to thank a previous reviewer for providing a synopsis as the Art Haus Music people neglected to provide one.",1368316800,5,6497,4.678321678321678
8534570,5,B00925T94W,"Read the reviews by Keris Nine and Giordano Bruno first. Everything they say is bang on. (Even their points of disagreement make sense. You won't get unanimity about this DVD.)

First, what's good about this DVD and why should you buy it if you are a serious music lover and opera afficionado?

1.) Pergolesi's music, melodically straightforward, often hard-driving, often rhythmically inventive (in a way that makes it fun to listen to, but tricky to play.) Most music lovers know and love Stravinsky's Pulcinello, which is based on the music of Pergolesi. Stravinsky has beautifully captured the charm of Pergolesi's music, and given it a neo-classical update.

A good many of us know about La Serva Padrona, which changed the course of opera and opened the way for longer and more ""serious"" applications of commedia dell'arte, such as The Marriage of Figaro (which may not have been possible without Serva.) The evening recreated by these DVDs is one of the most significant evenings in the history of music. Pergolesi's music is inexhaustibly charming and accessible, and, frankly, should be better known. (Here's your chance to help remedy that shortfall.)

2.) Pergolesi's bio. Irresistible three-hankie story about the gifted artist who was taken from us at the obscenely early age of 26, leaving behind an already impressive body of work, much of it in the standard repertoire today. Pergolesi was the John Keats of the 18th century. Both men died of TB in their mid-20s, leaving us to shake our heads and wonder ""What if?""

3.) Production quality. Very hi def video and audio. Outstanding microphone placement (this is a live stage recording.) Great camera work. Absolutely first-rate singing and instrumentals. Lovely ladies. Interesting acting. (Each singer must portray a modern party-goer portraying an 18th century singer portraying a historic/legendary character. All of that is before the costume and casting gender-bending, of which more later.) Also, this production was played in the G.B. Pergolesi Theater in Iesi, Pergolesi's home town. This one is for the Gipper, and the musicians rise to the occasion.

That said, I must warn that these DVDs are not for everybody. They will require work to be even marginally comprehensible. Don't expect to put Prigionier in your DVD and settle down with a bowl of popcorn for an evening's entertainment.

Now I will try to give some tips to purchasers to cut down on your bewilderment and homework time and help you get inside Il Prigionier as quickly as possible.

1.) The story. First the back story: Sostrate became the king of Norway by slaying Clearco, the previous king of Norway. (Clearco is the only character mentioned in this synopsis who is not a character in the drama.) Ericlea is Clearco's daughter. She loves Micisda, the prince of Bohemia. Note that Clearco's daughter, Ericlea, appears onstage with Sostrate, the guy who killed her father.

Metalce, the king of the Goths has defeated Sostrate in battle (with the help of Viridate, the prince of Denmark) and taken Sostrate prisoner. (Sostrate is the ""proud prisoner"" of the title.) Metalce, the Goth, hopes to marry Ericlea in order to cement Metalce's claim to the throne of Norway. (Remember, Ericlea is the daughter of the old king of Norway.) There is a lot of tension on the stage, between war winners and losers and between killers and bereft survivors when the curtain rises, and the libretto gives full voice to it. (More importantly, the 22-year-old kid G.B.Pergolesi sets the expressions of anger and grief to masterful Baroque music.)

Now the story itself: Metalce (the Goth) changes his marriage plans when he meets and is smitten by Rosmene, the daughter of Sostrate, and decides he wants to marry Rosmene, rather than Ericlea. (What the heck, they're both daughters of Norwegian kings. One ought to serve as well as the other to legitimize Metalce's claim to the throne.) However, Rosmene is also the object of Viridate's affections. (Remember, he's the prince of Denmark and was Metalce's ally in the recent war with Norway.)

Double-crossing and deceit begin immediately. Metalce (the Goth) disingenuously tells his ally, Viridate (of Denmark), that Rosmene is too small a reward for Viridate's aid in defeating Sostrate. (Hint, hint, hint.)

Metalce becomes increasingly intransigent. He finally gets really ugly and presents Rosmene with the ""Sophie's choice"" of condemning either Viridate or her father to death. She has to sign the death warrant herself and ""gets"" to do this as a reward for agreeing to marry Metalce. If Metalce were not a cross-dressing role, he would be sneering, twirling his mustache, and chuckling ""heh, heh, heh"" at this point.

However, Metalce has gone too far. Apparently he didn't read his Machiavelli carefully enough, and he now has too many enemies. (To the best of my knowledge, old Niccolo never suggested condemning to death an ally who helped you win a war.) Led by Viridate and Micisda, Metalce's army rises up in revolt and Metalce is overthrown. Happy ending. (Gotta have a happy ending. This opera was performed to celebrate the birthday of a Habsburg empress.)

2. Keeping the characters straight. There are four male characters and two female characters, but there are five female voices and only one male voice (a tenor, at that), so you know we've got a problem. (For those who are unfamiliar with Baroque opera: Yep, you read that right; that's what turned them on way back in the day. Actually, the original casting was even worse. Viridate, a male character, was sung by a castrato.)

So here's how to tell them apart. First, the two female characters wear strapless evening gowns. (Rosmene's gown is red, reflecting her name; Ericlea's is blue.)

The male characters are where it gets more interesting. Sostrate is easy to figure out. He is sung (big surprise!) by an actual unsnipped man, who starts the opera in a wheelchair, and gains the ability to walk during the course of the drama. (There is other symbolism that you should keep your eyes peeled for.) Viridate and Micisda are sung by women wearing evening gowns with straps. (Viridate's is pale green; Micisda's is black.) Finally, Metalce, the king of the Goths, is sung by a mezzo wearing the punk style known as . . . Goth! How clever can it get?

There are also full-size dolls for each character. They're actually easier to figure out than the singers. Rosmene's doll is a woman wearing pink (echoing the red of the singer's strapless gown); Ericlea's is a woman wearing green (pretty close to the blue of the singer's dress); Sostrate's is a coatless Byronic hero in shirtsleeves; Metalce's doll is dressed exotically and wears a turban; Viridate's and Micisda's dolls are males in formal wear of green and black, respectively, matching the singers' gowns.

3.) The staging. The central idea of the staging is that the singers have been at a party, where the vita was dolce, the vino was flowing, the gowns were overflowing, the hands were groping, and the stiletto heels were five inches high. The party-goers stagger down into a basement or grotto, find the dolls and decide, like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney, to ""put on a show ourselves.""

This staging conceit adds another full level to the already whacked out concepts of the opera. We get to do some Italian people watching a la Fellini. Metalce (I will use the character names to refer to the party goers) appears to be neck deep in a mid-life crisis. She's a middle-aged woman walking around in black leather, black fishnet stockings, a mid-thigh skirt, and spiky hair. She swigs vino (or something stronger) straight from the bottle, lets Sostrate get his hands and arms around her thighs, and struts her stuff by clomping around on her five-inch heels. Early on (in aria number 7) Metalce (who, don't forget, is a military conqueror) sings a vigorous complaint about how tough his life is. The singer puts enough real emotion into the aria that we suspect he (she, actually) is singing about his (her) real life.

Well, if you decide to buy Prigionier, I hope this helps you cut through the puzzlement and get on to the fun.

I agree with the previous reviewers about La Serva Padrona. The production qualities are fine, and I'm not sorry that I own it as a freebie with Prigionier. But I would have been very disappointed if I had paid money to buy it as a single opera. The main problem is that the story just doesn't translate into a circus setting. In a domestic setting, it is plausible that Uberto, a proper gentleman, would accept the need to get married, despite Serpina's lack of social rank, before enjoying the privileges of marriage. But a circus? I always thought that promiscuity was a primary reason why you ran away to join a circus. It is not credible that Serpina can use the ""love and marriage/horse and carriage"" moral conformity approach with Uberto the animal trainer. To own a DVD with a more believable staging, I suggest the Brazilian production with Silvia Klein as Serpina. It is altogether heartwarming and fun, and probably comes much closer to what the kid Pergolesi had in mind.",1357344000,12,9133,4.929082628497072
8534571,3,B00925T94W,"Read Keris Nine's review before continuing with mine. Keris says all the nice things about these two productions that I would prefer to say, and Keris is a consistently fine reviewer. However ...

These two DVDs make a very good case for the value of sound-only CDs. The staging of La Serva Padrona, mis-en-scene in a circus, is not offensive. In fact, it's modestly amusing. But it completely disregards and diminishes both the humor and the earnest social commentary of the libretto, which is all about class consciousness and class resentment. If the drama is so dispensable, why not just stage it as a concert, even though it was the drama more than the rather workaday music that kept this intermezzo popular far longer than any other stage piece by Pergolesi?

""Il Prigionier Superbo"" is another matter. Several of the arias and ensemble pieces in it are very fine, fiery/luscious Vivaldi-worthy Baroque, and some of the principal singers are musically magnificent in their roles: Marina di Liso as the cruel usurper Metalce, Marina Comparato as his rival Viridate, and Marina Cusi as Rosmene, the woman they both desire. But the staging is a horror show of unnecessary confusion and distraction. Each of the six main characters is represented on stage by a bunraku-style costumed puppet. Unfortunately, the puppetry isn't very skillful or consistent, and the camera close-ups of the singers pay spotty attention to the puppets at best. All of the principals except the prisoner-king Sostrate are sopranos or altos -- women in this production though the roles were probably composed for castrati. The women singers, however, are not gender-costumed, so one needs to pay rather close attention to who's who. Could it be that the costume designer simply permitted all five women to clad themselves according to their individual whimsy? Four of them wear bare-shoulder evening gowns with spike heels, looking precisely like the maids-of-honor at a bourgeois wedding in a provincial city south of Roma. The cruel usurper Metalce is tarted up as a lookalike for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Sostrate, for no apparent reason sings most of his role in a wheel chair. There are curiouser & curiouser bits of stage business, including cut-out oil drums and unglued paper boxes in which the characters lurk or hide. There are unexplained non-singing extras bopping on and off stage intermittently, some of whom are bulky men of color. The characters pat and prod each other, and offer each other glasses of champagne, in a manner that has nothing to do with their ""dramatic"" interactions. The best word for this staging comes from Yiddish; it's meshugga!",1354060800,6,2654,5.057077625570776
8534572,5,B00925T94W,"Last year saw the Blu-ray release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adriano-in-Siria/dp/B005UOK9HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adriano in Siria</a>, the first Pergolesi opera made available through a new initiative by the Fondazione Pergolesi Spontini to not only stage new editions of all the existing opera works by the composer - all of them rare, most all-but forgotten - but to have them all released to the public on DVD and, if we're lucky, Blu-ray.  The hopes raised by Adriano in Siria at the possibility of recovering some unheard of masterpieces are met with yet another extraordinary work (or should I say pair of works, since the composer's Intermezzos are also being recorded and released alongside the main works) in the 1732 dramma per musica Il Prigionier Superbo (The Proud Captive), which is released here alongside its rather more famous Intermezzo, La Serva Padrona.  And, happily, it's another exceptionally well-performed production of a work that truly merits rediscovery and re-evaluation, which also looks and sounds just incredible in the High Definition Blu-ray format.

Il Prigionier Superbo, right from the outset, demonstrates a sense of melody and use of instruments that sounds to me quite unlike anything else from this period.  The work as a whole reveals similarities to other contemporaneous composers in certain respects - an unrelenting rhythmic force that reminds one of Steffani, with some furious Vivaldian flurries and a sense of Handelian dignity in the how it carries the 'affetto' emotional core of the drama - but there is at the same time something unique about the way the musical approach reveals the emotions behind the drama.  Directed by Corrado Rovaris and recorded in the intimate and acoustically sparkling surroundings of the Teatro G. B. Pergolesi in Jesi, it's the quality of the HD sound formats that reveal those telling details in the scoring and in the variety and use of the period instruments that the conductor and the Accademia Barocca de i Virtuosi Italiani tease out of a work that would otherwise seem fairly conventional in form.  The musical arrangements rather seem to reflect the more involved circumstances and nature of Il Prigionier's drama, showing a sophistication that suggests deeper conflicting sentiments and even connections between the characters and their individual motivations.

Set for some reason within a cave, Henning Brockhaus' staging also reflects the complications and sophistication of the arrangements.  Or at least it attempts to, but I'm not sure it doesn't just end up needlessly complicating things further.  Nearly all the roles are played by females (Jesi seems to prefer the female voice to countertenors) who wear modern dresses, regardless of whether they are playing men or women, their roles (""artistic alter-egos"" apparently according to the booklet) acted out by more traditionally attired near life-size marionettes.  It makes it all a bit more visually interesting than the usually static nature of opera seria, enlivening the recitative sections in particular, but it's also a little cluttered and doesn't really add anything that couldn't be expressed a little more conventionally by the singers alone, since there is a very strong cast here more than capable of bringing it to life.  There are no main starring role and no show-stopping arias, but each performer nonetheless has the opportunity to express their ability and serve the dramatic purpose through wonderfully written individual arias or scenes, and each of them rises to their moment with some fine singing.  The success of the production lies not just in the singers or the direction then, but in how they are marvellously brought together, with consideration for the nuances of the music and for the drama as a whole.

It was the practice for Neapolitan opera to have a short comic farce for two or three singers played out in the intervals between the acts of the main 'dramma per musica', and Il Prigionier Superbo is paired here with its original Intermezzo - and the work that would come to eclipse it, at least in terms of historical importance - La Serva Padrona ('The Servant Turned Mistress').  It was this little comic interlude that would become the focus of a heated debate in France known as the 'Querelle des bouffons' (1752) over the superiority of Italian comic opera over the rather stuffy long-winded academicism of the royalty-approved native French form.  It's not difficult to see why a work like La Serva Padrona would be so popular, its subject matter and irreverence showing a pre-revolutionary disrespect not only for the nobility, but also in how takes opera further away from the myths, gods and legends of opera seria by making common people and their down-to-earth affairs the subject of the work.  You can see the influence this might have had on Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, but La Serva Padrona goes one step further here with its suggestiveness and the outrageous situation where a shameless maidservant, Serpina, not only demands to be treated as an equal with her exasperated master, Uberto, but also believes that she is worthy of marrying him and becoming the dominant one.

That's evidently not as shocking an idea now as it might have been back in 1732, and that's maybe why the director Henning Brockhaus chooses not to rely on the traditional setting of the noble/servant relationship, but sets it instead in a circus which is perhaps more in keeping with the farcical, colourful nature of the work and its historical legacy.  Again though, rather like the staging for Il Prigionier Superbo, this doesn't really add anything to the work - which as an Intermezzo was never intended to be fully staged in any event - but it serves well enough for the comic elements that ensue.  Aside from its historical importance, La Serva Padrona's reputation and fame is merited as a comic drama as well as for its musical qualities.  It's only 50 minutes long and there is quite a bit of recitative within that, but there is also a great deal of humour in the situation and some lovely lyrical beauty in the arias which have the same effervescent character that is in all Pergolesi's compositions.  It's sung and played reasonably well here with an appropriately light touch by Alessandra Marianelli and Carlo Lepore, even if it's not the most witty staging or interpretation of the work, but that could be as much to do with the work being placed in its original context for the first time in centuries alongside a work that now looks to be the superior achievement.

As indicated above, credit goes not just to Jesi for putting on these works, but also to distributors who are putting them out on Blu-ray, since the High Definition format allows these rare opera works to be fully appreciated by a wider public.  The quality of the A/V on this Arthaus release is impressive, all the more so for the detail that the audio mixes in particular bring out of the period instruments and playing of the Accademia Barocca de i Virtuosi Italiani.  Unlike the interweaving of Adriano in Siria and Livietta e Tracollo one within the other, the Dramma and the Intermezzo here were filmed on separate occasions (one in 2009, the other in 2011) and you have to watch each piece separately, which is probably preferable for the home viewer.  The BD is all-region compatible with subtitles in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Korean.",1350000000,11,7486,5.101390024529844
