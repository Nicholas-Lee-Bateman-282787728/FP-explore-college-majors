4593202,5,B0056YMDVE,"My 5 year old daughter loves this movie and it's nice having a shorter movie to be able to have as an option when a full length movie is too long :-)

Perfect for all ages!!",1354233600,,173,3.8055555555555554
4593203,5,B0056YMDVE,"I really like this DVD.  The color and graphics are amazing.  This is not a bluray disk, but the color and detail are excellent.  It has a nice plot.  I understand this is an abbreviated version.  I would like to have seen the full version.  I also have the first Monsters vs Aliens in bluray, and I don't think it is quite as good as this one.  Something to watch every Halloween.",1352592000,,381,4.208333333333333

4593205,5,B0056YMDVE,"We have watched this the past 2 years, being released in 2009. I was just lamenting the fact that I couldn't find it being broadcast on my local stations this Halloween Season. But now! Here it is.

If you liked the original movie, this holds all of the fun, light thrills and goofy comedy as the original. All the characters are present and a few more. The Mstant Pumpkins are hilarious, growing bigger and stronger by eating Halloween candy.

This is only a 22 minute TV Show, so don't be disappointed by the short length. It was originally just aired on TV. But its worth it. Not too scary but not The Great Pumpkin kind of tame. (and lame, in my opinion).

Enjoy!",1319414400,,667,4.40650406504065
4593206,1,B0056YMDVE,"First of all...we have the full length movie and my son ADORES it! He is 2 and mimics all of the characters:)
Needless to say I was excited to see a new one out (even if it went straight to DVD) especially that it involved Halloween seemed perfect. I had no clue that it was only 20 min or so long. Before you can even start to get into it, it's over.
Story (or lack thereof) is very basic and silly. What a waste. Cost me just as much as the regular movie too...",1317686400,4,463,3.9361702127659575
4593207,5,B0056YMDVE,"This is a delightful short feature (27 minutes) of mutant pumpkins vs. monsters. This would make a great seasonal family film for the kids as it lacks the traditional frightening features of traditional movies at this time. The movie starts out with aliens accidentally mutating pumpkins in Modesto, by disposing of their waste. The monsters are called on to save the world. The mutant pumpkins eat candy.

Most of the humor is geared toward the younger crowd, with only a few jokes that only mom and dad might get. ""If they give you candy, they are human. If they want to probe you, they are probably an alien.""",1317427200,3,612,4.666666666666667

8460036,2,B0056YMDVE,"It was more like a commercial than a movie...too short, no story, ends abruptly.  I'm going to send it to my 6 yr old niece as a ""trick"" for Halloween.",1414108800,,151,4.033333333333333
