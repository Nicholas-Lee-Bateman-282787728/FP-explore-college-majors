8636826,4,B00HW76F30,"This is a really nice flick for everyone. A baby monkey is re-introduced to his birthplace, the Amazon forest. There is no  script, just animals. Not sure how but I think it took them 1000's of video hours to make this movie. All the different journeys that this baby monkey  goes through, eating, meeting new friends, meeting new animals who want to eat him. A real great look at some different animals and insects of the river basin.
A real delight for little kids up to the elderly.
Also a nice gift that won't be forgotten.",1401926400,,527,4.479166666666667
