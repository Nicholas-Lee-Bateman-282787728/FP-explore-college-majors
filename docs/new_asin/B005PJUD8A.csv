This is obviously a much different Zatoichi, starring a young Shingo Katori, a hugely popular actor/singer in Japan. His take on the iconic character is much different than the classic take. There's less flash, less comedy. It is a much more serious character that Katsu's version. Basically its like Timothy Dalton's take on James Bond compared with Sean Connery. Yet License to Kill was critically one of the best Bond movies ever. If you're stuck On Katsu's character, you may not like this movie. If you're open to a more grown up and realistic version, as well as a more complicated and less straight forward movie, than you will probably enjoy it. The cinematography and camerawork is great, and a lot of the experience is just soaking in the images. I previously saw another (bootleg) version of this on DVD that had horrible subtitles. The subtitles on this version are better. There are a few portions I think the subtitles have been overly simplified, but this is a minor complaint. My DVD player for some reason defaulted to a director's commentary audio. I simply switched the audio over to track #2 by pressing the ""AUDIO"" button on my remote while the movie was playing as all was good. DVD is excellent quality in terms of video and audio quality. It is anamorphic widescreen. The DVD played just fine here in the USA",1317081600,,1471,4.727626459143969
