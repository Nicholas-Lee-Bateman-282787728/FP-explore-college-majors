The take on Cannibalism is very limited focusing mainly on cases of extreme survival: to get through harsh winters in the days of North Americas move westward, or stranded soldiers on a boat afloat. In such cases I see more an act of survival then what the term cannibalism evokes in my mind.

Lacking, was clear links to cultures that act out cannibalism for cultural, sacred, and spiritual purposes. Lacking was a link to cannibalism on a global scale putting the act into perspective through the intellectual an open prism of academia.

What was included was reference to modern day forensic science attempting to crack historical cases of survival in which cannibalism was suspect. This in fact is not bad. I was expecting more from the History Channel, I would watch it as an episode on TV: UNLESS your aim includes a viewing with interests primarily in forensics and challenging situations of survival in which humans ""had to"" consume humans. One of the cases investigated, a good 15 ish minutes of the documentary, yielded a negative result (forensics determined cannibalism did not exist). I wondered why the case was included as a feature, and simply not just referred to, as the aim was looking at the history of cannibalism; not the history of non-cannibalism.

I did enjoy viewing it, but thought it lacked a lot.",1321056000,2,1344,4.834782608695652
8177305,4,B000NDIAVK,"I was hoping that this DVD would be a documentary about cannibals in Africa or New Guinea, alas, they were not even mentioned.
This DVD covered 3 specific events that involved cannibalism.
This first one covers the Donner party. The segment is alright, it dispels some fo the common myths regarding the event. The dramatizations are ok and the information is alright too. Nothing really ground breaking in it though.
The next segment talked about an instance of cannibalism that took place during the infamous Bay of Pigs incident. It is a little known and fairly interesting situation.
The last segment went over a group of pre-historic people from England (pre-historic is, in this instance people around 3500 BC, before records began on the British isles.) It is probably the most interesting segment of the 3, as it is more along the lines of I was expecting.
Overall, this was an interesting DVD but it didn't cover the roots of cannibalism. It didn't really explain why people choose to be cannibals either. It could've been much much better, but as it is, it was alright as a documentary and entertaining as well.",1204329600,6,1120,4.838541666666667
