8134194,3,B000GRUTGM,Wasn't really what i had expected. Really low budget making and the story line was rather easy to follow and watchable. Some good gory kills but nothing you great you seen worse in other horror movies. A great watch tho.,1508976000,,220,4.525
8134195,5,B000GRUTGM,Fun and original slasher film with a killer in a clown mask getting revenge using telekinesis in some scenes.  Good kills and a fun final girl chase with an interesting plot twist for the end.  The film made perfect sense to me and was entertaining!,1487548800,,249,4.511111111111111
8134196,1,B000GRUTGM,"This is probably one of the rarest horror movies from the 90s to be released on DVD. The film is directed by Todd Cook, who's known or not so known for making quite a few low budget films over the 90s and early-mid 00s. I actually wasn't even aware that this movie ever even existed, due to it's budget, until I came across its trailer on Youtube a couple of months ago. But now lets get into the review!

So for starters, this is pretty much a low budget film with a typical plot. The movie opens with the main character Jimmy Fisher, who's the high school nerd and is constantly being picked on by a clique of preppy, popular, bratty kids. That afternoon as he walks home from school, he's offered an invitation by head bully, Peter, who's throwing a party that night. Jimmy foolishly accepts and unbeknownst to him, the invitation is all a ploy to set him up for their latest prank. The opening credits then begin.

That evening when Jimmy arrives to the destination, which turned out to be an abandoned house for sale; he steps inside the house to find Jennifer, Peter's girlfriend and his long time crush. Jennifer seduces Jimmy before the rest of the bullying kids step out and attack Jimmy. After the prank leaves Jimmy unconscious, Peter and his gang run off to his house down the street for the real party. When Jimmy awakens later that night, so does an evil within him that's been building inside of him for quite some time and been waiting to be unleashed.

Jimmy goes on a killing spree and knocks off his tormentors one by one. The bullies  may have given Jimmy Fisher a night he'll never forget, but Jimmy will give them all a night they won't live to remember.

A few things need to be said about this film. First off it was in made in the early 90s. 1992 I believe, so although the plot may sound a bit bland and boring in today's times; the whole high school nerd vs high school bullies was a common and acceptable movie plot back then. Second, the budget for this film is EXTREMELY poor. This is pretty much the lowest of the low budget films. The camera quality looks as if it was done on a $10 camera bought at a yard sale. Because of that it makes it nearly difficult to fully see any shots done in the dark.

The dialogue for the film is dreadful as most of the time there are these awkward 3 second pauses between interactions with the characters. The characters also talk awkwardly and lack in acting skills, almost sounding like they were actually reading from cue cards. It wouldn't surprise me if they were. Speaking of the characters, there's absolutely no build-up for them at all. No background information, no nothing. The attire that Jimmy wears when he's in killer form is a bit mediocre as it's a black coat and a scary clown mask. But I will give props to the mask. GREAT clown mask! Very creepy! The kill scenes are gory but at the end of every kill scene, the movie suddenly freezes for a second and jumps to the next scene. One guy even stands there and allows himself to get killed. Seriously?

Overall, this movie is pretty bad. And it's not one of those bad horror movies that are good. On a scale of 1-10, Evil Night gets about a -1000. The ending is pretty lame and makes absolutely no sense. Then again, the whole entire movie didn't make sense. It's almost as if logic was tossed out the window and a horror movie was made just because. In a way, this movie seems like a rip-off or a bad sequel to Slaughter High; a 1986 low budget horror film with a similar plot.

When it comes down to it; if you like movies that are extremely bad, probably have a budget of less than $100, makes no sense, has bad acting, has a bad ending and doesn't measure up, then by all means buy Evil Night. If you're looking for a horror movie that will entertain you and make you feel like you got your money's worth, stay far far away from this one. If anything, Evil Night is best for sleeping through. I always wondered why this movie was so rarely known, talked about or for sale, but after watching it myself, I now know why. If you still decide to buy it, don't say you weren't warned",1405641600,,4114,4.34765625
