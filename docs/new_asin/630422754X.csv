813575,4,630422754X,"I love Pilates and Yoga, and this combines the best of both.  Jennifer Kries is terrific.  She's warm, and friendly and explains the moves and positioning of your body without talking down to you.  The video video is 40 minutes, with 15 minutes of upper body sculpting and 15 minutes of lower or ""total"" sculpting for the legs, buttocks, and thighs.  Some of the moves are hard, especially towards the end.  There are some variations on push-ups that if you have little or no strength in your arms I would either skip or do less of them until you gain the strength.  When paired together with The Method's Precision Toning you have the perfect 1,2 punch to your workout regime.",988502400,11,677,4.6
813576,5,630422754X,"If you've ever admired and/or desired to have a dancer's lean body then this workout routine will be a good place to start. As someone who takes belly dancing lessons weekly (and soon weekly Flamenco dancing lessons) I find Ms. Kries' workout to be surprisingly helpful even with my dance practice and performance - especially her constant attention to proper posture and good form.
In fact, my instructor uses Mr. Kries workout routines for a toning and strengthening class she teaches. She has an optional 1 hour class before the belly dancing class where we do precisely this workout. The funny thing is, she didn't tell anyone where she got the routine. I only recognized it AFTER I bought this tape when I popped it in the VCR and discovered to my great surprise I was doing the routine from my instructor's class!
There are some important points about this tape potential purchasers may wish to know. For one, you will need to keep your chest lifted, stomach in, buttocks tight, thighs tight and chin lifted AT ALL TIMES throughout the workout unless Ms. Kries tells you differently. Otherwise, you will get no - I REPEAT - almost no benefit from these exercises. This is harder than at first it may seem simply because you will also be trying to follow all the various exercise instructions Ms. Kries gives. This is a lot to remember and in the beginning when I first learned this routine I was continually having to remind myself to keep my muscles contracted and chest lifted. After a while however it becomes second nature.
The good thing is, if you do keep your posture good, muscles contracted, etc - basically follow Ms. Kries instructions - you will get a very good workout indeed. It will definitely tone your body, thin your thighs, stomach, etc. She uses very light weights in this video - they look like maybe 2 lb. dumbbells but you can use more, less or none if you desire. I'm up to 12 lbs. and get a fantastic muscle-building burn.
She often reminds you to stretch. Really stretch for that ceiling or reach out for that wall which will help elongate the muscles as well as add flexibility. Ms. Kries is one of the better video instructors I've seen when it comes to cueing and describing precisely how and where you should feel certain muscles working. She is very encouraging saying things such as, ""This may be a difficult at first - perhaps more work than you're used to, but it WILL get easier."" She also moves at an easy pace so beginners will find her easy to follow.
There is no music except at the very beginning of the tape. It is only Ms. Kries instructions and counting out of the repetitions. Actually I think this is a plus because you will be so busy trying to follow precisely all her directions and cues while maintaining proper form that I think music would have been more of a distraction. Also, the exercises and pace seems more typical of yoga or a stretch video. No high-tempo aerobic exercise or music here so you will need to get your cardio workout some other way to compliment this routine.
Occasionally Ms. Kries will remind you to do these exercises while keeping your muscles contracted and chest lifted. ""Squeeze your thighs together as tight as you can - like you're pressing a very thin ribbon between them."" or telling you to get your navel to contract inward like you're trying to get it to touch your spine. It would be more helpful for a beginner if she had said these reminders more often. That is probably the one potential downside to this tape. Unless a beginner remembers to keep their form proper at all times even w/o reminder cues from Ms. Kries they will not get much from these exercises. On the upside, if a beginner CAN remember to maintain these form pointers throughout the exercises it is one of the most effective workouts around for getting toned without building muscle.
This is one of my favorite exercise videos and I work out to it even on days when I don't go to my dance instructor's class. I use it in conjunction with a Karen Voight video (another favorite video fitness instructor of mine who's tapes are also available at ...). If you are willing to make the commitment to learning the routine properly you will definitely be rewarded with a better body all around for the time spent.",983577600,39,4268,4.602362204724409
813577,5,630422754X,"As a child I dreamed of being a ballerina. Dancing across a field of flowers or standing with perfect posture. Yes, I do feel taller after each session. I am already tall enough but being taller makes you look thinner.  Why do we women wear high heels? Case Closed! The plan is to do these  exercises so precisely that you don't need to spend all day at a gym. I  find these videos to be up there in the top 10 of my collection. Yes,  working out does take motivation and an hour may seem long until you look  at yourself in the mirror and see the new you and it is worth the effort.  Believe me, I am no where near perfect but I do have goals.  If you are  tired of loud music, bouncy exercises and annoying instructors (as I am),  add this to your collection. You will feel like a dancer and may start to  look like one too.

813578,4,630422754X,"Precision Toning is a very refreshing approach to  exercise. In an easy to follow (although not so easy to execute) program.  Jennifer walks you carefully through the movements that are fairly simple, but very effective.  I have noticed lengthening of muscles, greater strength and flexiblity. It  seems that you can continue to be challenged by this video for quite a  while. This video focuses on abdominal strength and overall flexability.  My only complaint is the length of the video. An hour is a bit too long for  me.",953769600,10,524,4.886363636363637
813579,2,630422754X,I think the workout is rigorous but the tape is too slow.  After the first 2 or 3 times viewing the tape I did not need her extended explanations.  I found I was waiting for the next exercise which made it a tedious  experience.,948672000,16,228,4.136363636363637
7865554,5,630422754X,"This was recommended to me by my Alexander Technique teacher.  The sculpting exercises are easy and give you a good stretch without discomfort.  Jennifer also explains things slowly and clearly.  She's just not there to ""show off"" like some instructors are.  She really wants you to learn and benefit from this Pilates time.",1367971200,,324,5.056603773584905
7865555,5,630422754X,I love this video & am having transferred to a dvd for ease of use.  I am so glad I was able to get it again as my old copy got lost.,1360540800,,133,3.15625
7865556,4,630422754X,"I have owned this tape for about 7 years and after doing it 2-3 time when I first got it, it has just been collecting dust.  I grew tired of the intense and exhausting weight training and aerobics that I had been doing for a few years and decided a little over a month ago to take a break.  I decided to do Pilates in the meantime to maintain my muscle tone.  I dusted this tape off and was pleasantly surprised.  I noticed visible results after the first week even though I was only doing it 2 or 3 times a week.  This tape has helped to tighten my stomach considerably.  A feat I could not accomplish after years of weight training and ab work.  My thighs and [...] are also considerably firmer.  All of this in a little over a month's time.  The tape is not the most energizing or interesting, but I don't think that is the point of the excercises.  If you are looking for a way to calm down after a long day and still tone your body, this is a wonderful tape.  The instructor can be a little dry and over explanatory, but she is clear and concise in what you need to do.  She very rarely gives instruction without being in a pose or an excercise herself.  So, once you become familiar with the instruction, there is no need to wait for her to finish.  Just start the excercise without her or maintain the pose while she is talking.  I am enjoying my hiatus from strenuous excercise that I really dreaded and still seeing amazing results thanks to this tape.",1127174400,5,1461,4.242753623188406
7865557,5,630422754X,"I LOVE THIS TAPE!!! Finally, Finally, Finally an excercise tape that doesn't assume I'm an olympic gymnast! This tape is perfect for someone trying to incorporate excercise after having rather sedentary habits. This is the fourth or fifth tape I've purchased and out of those only one was even do-able by someone like me. ( Perfect Pilates: I would do half the tape but still had some trouble) This tape isn't boring because the excercises change from one to another. Also just when you think OH-no, here we go... a really difficult excercise... she only has you do it three or four times and gently moves to something else. Her voice is calm and she TEACHES how to stand correctly during the excercises so your not hurting yourself..It's like having a personal instructor!! But one I can afford! I feel every muscle in my body but they aren't KILLING me, they feel GOOD. Before this tape, I had a pain in my back for about four months that.. And I am not exaggerating... that 4 month old pain that was making it hard to sleep, went away after doing the tape...not for a month or a week but after the FIRST time I did the tape. It used to hurt when I took in a deep breath and that night suddenly I noticed it was gone!! I'm almost 42, not very physically active..this tape is THE perfect group of excercises if you need to become flexible, strong without being screamed at and jolted around the room like your in bootcamp. I also had no trouble following along without cranking my neck in the middle of an awkward stretch because she explains and eases you through from one excercise to the next.  (I watched the tape through one time before starting). Really, at the end of the tape Jennifer says ""Thank You"" and I find myself saying ""No, Thank YOU"". This is a tape that I KNOW I will actually do! ~A HEART FELT THANK YOU TO JENNIFER KRIES~",1109635200,4,1842,4.449704142011834
7865558,2,630422754X,"i BOUGHT THIS TAPE, AND WAS SO EXCITED, SO i PUT IT ON AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS NOTHING OF WHAT i WAS EXPECTING, SHE STARTS TALKING EXPLAINING THINGS YOU ALREADY KNOW AND THE WORKOUTS ARE VERY BORING

ON THE BACK IT SAYS:

 PART 1- UPPERBODY 15MIN. WORKT USING LIGHTWEIGHTS FOR ARMS, CHEST AND SHOULDERS( THESE ARE THE SAME ROUTINES YOU KNOW THAT IS ON EVERY VIDEO WHICH IS NOT WORTH IT

PART 2- 15MIN. WRKT FOR LEGS, BUTTOCKS AND HIPS ( AS USUAL THE SAME THINGS YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT DID NOTHING FOR ME I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING IN MY LEGS THAT MADE ME FEEL THAT I HAS A GOOD WORKOUT

IN CONCLUSION THIS ARE THE SAME WORKOUTS YOU HAVE IN ALL YOUR OTHER VIDEOS THIS IS JUST MORE OF WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE

--I AM A BIG FAN OF JENNIFER KRIES BUT I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS WORKOUT IT JUST WAS NOT CHALLENGING FOR ME AND MOST OF THE WORKOUT SHE SPEND TALKING INSTEAD OF WORKINGOUT AND THE WORKT WAS SUPER SLOW WHICH GOT VERY BORING--",1097452800,5,934,4.161111111111111
7865559,4,630422754X,"I want to begin by noting that this workout is very different than how it's described on the box. First of all, the box states that the workout is made up of two segments, 15 minutes of ""upper body sculpting"" and 15 minutes of ""total body sculpting."" In reality, the routine does not have distinct breaks into separate sections, and the upper body work accounts for the majority of the workout. In addition, the box states that you will shape your muscles ""without push-ups"" when in fact several sets of push-ups are included in the workout. Finally, the box makes no mention of the ballet segment which is included towards the end of the routine.

 Despite these discrepancies, I found this to be a nice full body, light toning routine. The workout is based on Pilates principles, and thus it would be helpful to have some prior familiarity with Pilates. The first 6 minutes consists of a slow warmup to stretch your muscles, introduce breathing techniques, and familiarize yourself with the movements. Standing arms toning using light weights comes next; this segment is approximately 12 minutes. The movements are small and the repetitions low, so precise attention to form is very important.

 The routine then moves to the floor for another 12 or so minutes of upper body work. You will begin in a seated position for additional arms moves using the weights and then move on to the push-ups, which include a set of push-ups on your knees plus several different sets of plank variations. Finally, the workout moves on to the lower body. This last section (about 10 minutes) includes a bridge series and a ballet segment. The latter requires balance and control, although a chair can be used if needed. The workout ends with just a few minutes of additional standing stretches for a total of 43 minutes.

 I was familiar with the instructor, Jennifer Kries, from other workouts in The Method series. I tend not to like her style--which I find a bit condescending and show-offy--but she generally instructs well and provides adequate non-mirrored cueing. In this video, she spends quite a bit of time on form details, which would be helpful for beginners but which makes the routine move a bit slowly for more intermediate exercisers like myself. Overall, this routine is most ideally suited to beginners in strength training who have some background in Pilates or intermediates who wish to alternate a light routine with their heavier weight work.",1090454400,5,2450,4.891566265060241
7865560,4,630422754X,"This video DOES work and it DOES change your physique but you must have the right form!  I have worked out regularly in gyms, run etc for over 15 years and think that this Precision Sculpting video is a gentle way to tone your body.  The trick is to listen to Jennifer Kries's instructions and concentrate on maintaining the proper form. The first time I did this video, I thought it was too easy. But, then I read some reviews and went back and really concentrated on keeping my legs in the proper Pilates stance, tightening my buttocks and keeping my navel to the spine.  I only use 5lbs weights (and won't use more so I maintain my form) and this tape does keep me toned. And, it's fun!  I fastforward now through some of Kries's instructions but it's still a great alterative to traditional weight work which frankly, after all these years, is really starting to bore me!  The ideal mix, in my opinion, is this video alternative with a more traditional pilates video which focuses on lots of lower abs,back and leg work.  Throw in a bit of cardio and you have a toned supple figure!",1030924800,,1086,4.459595959595959
7865561,5,630422754X,"No disrespect, but she must have been thinking of a differnt tape. The instructor does not wear a headset at any point in the tape, and there are no aerobic moves whatsoever....
This tape is awesome, my favorite workout tape. No jerky movements at all. The routine is smooth and focused and very effective. You will feel the results the first time you use it. Jennifer Kreis is great. The first half is an upper body workout with light weights, the second half is a fabulous and fun workout that really targets the abs and glutes. I agree with some of the other reviewers, the ""push-up"" routine is the best, and don't worry you don't have to be able to do many traditional push ups to do it at all. It's very unique and you really will feel taller after this one!",1027468800,8,763,4.380281690140845
7865562,1,630422754X,"If you've never taken a dance class this video is not for you! The moves are complicated and change very quickly. The instructor in the second part (weights and aerobics) screws up and subsequently the class seems less than synchronized much of the time. The third part's instructor speaks too low to be heard so she wears a headset microphone. As a result, you hear every breath and ""popping p"" throughout the section.
I'm sorry I bought this tape. Try The Firm videos instead, they really work.",1026518400,,496,4.712643678160919
7865563,4,630422754X,"When I first tried the video, I thought that it is too fast paced, with the instructions taking more time than the exercises.  After you get used to it and learn the basics, however, you can either fast forward the instructions or just start the exercise while the isntructor walks you through.
The editorial review says taht the tape is broken into two 15-minute workouts.  This is not the case--the tape is one entire 40 minute workout.  Jennifer, (the instructor) is very good, no nonsense ""You are doing a great job"" type.  Since 40 minutes is hard for me to fit into my weekdays, I use the tape on the weekend for an overall practice and use the Method: Target Specifics 15 minute workouts during the week.",992822400,,711,4.574803149606299
