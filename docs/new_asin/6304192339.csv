805367,4,6304192339,"If you love movies, you have to be curious. I'm well aware that it's not possible, even for the most resistant among us, to see, let's say, the whole american production of the year. So how could we find the time to  admire the european, asiatic, african or south american movies presented  each year ? Oh yes ! I forgot one thing. Most of us have a 50 hours working  week to digest... How but how to make the right choice ? I'm pretty sure  that everybody has his own answer to this question. Personally, I choose  the movies I see by the name of the director. Because I'm convinced that  the only movies that'll pass the test of time will be the movies shot by  authors-directors.
John Cassavetes was one of these authors-directors  and his movies are already classics. A few weeks ago, Pioneer has presented  SHADOWS, the first movie of John Cassavetes, in the DVD standard. Shot in  black and white, with unknown actors, in the streets of New-York, SHADOWS  is a magistral first movie. An improvisation if we have to believe the  final credits.
SHADOWS is the kind of movie which is going to make you  love cinema once again and forget all the trashy images you have swallowed  this year. It's not perfect but John Cassavetes was a movie lover and  that's the only thing that matters. He was honest and he deserves  respect.
A scene access and a two pages essay as sole bonus features.  Sound and images are below average but I don't care. I'm curious.
A DVD  dedicated to the independent ones.",957571200,6,1498,4.5055762081784385
805368,4,6304192339,"""Shadows"" possesses a special place for many would-be film historians as the film that launched ""independent film"". If nothing else, it launched one of the most chronically misunderstood -- but  utterly essential -- series of American film. Lots of small things happen  in ""Shadows"" despite its short running length: this is due in  part to the fact that the film combines half its material from an earlier  film of ""improvisation"" with a collection of more scripted scenes  shot two years later with the same cast. What's stunning about the  completed film is how GORGEOUSLY it presents human behavior in all its  fascinating, modern messiness. Cassavetes was perhaps the first filmmaker  to deliberately -- and successfully -- attempt the feat, which he  subsequently honed as a skill in his future masterpieces.
Like the others  in this Pioneer series, the DVD is merely adequate: it presents the picture  and sound. As in the others, Ray Carney provides a short analytic essay in  the insert that is useful to anyone not already familiar with Cassavetes'  art. We're lucky to have this film available in any form. Highly  recommended.
[Incidentally, whatever other Amazon reviewer it was that  thinks they found a racist agenda to this film completely missed the boat.  However, racism is faced by the characters and plays an overt role in the  narrative, and significantly, comprises much of the oldest material in the  film. The original project was for an unrealized film ABOUT racism; the  material added later was not, and the complexities of the resulting  combination make the film what it is.]",951609600,9,1605,5.076628352490421
805369,5,6304192339,"Cassavetes' work has always not gone down the genre-driven, formulaic Hollywood studio system path. Rather, and Shadows is a fine example, he is ever asking the audience questions instead of providing cheap answers. The  performances of the players are nothing short of brilliant for  nonprofessional actors as are the New York locations. This is a bittersweet  comedy which was supposed to be more of a comment on racism but later  cutting and reshooting shaped the picture into more of a study on what  drives us all: Emotion; instinct; stuff we don't even know about ourselves.  I fell in love instantly with the Lelia character, played by Lelia Goldoni.",930700800,3,657,5.037037037037037

Cassavetes already showed a rare gift for letting characters be more real life than standard movie heroes or villains.

805492,3,6304192339,"In 1957, actor John Cassavetes who had appeared in a good number of Hollywood films had also ran a workshop for fellow thespians in New York City.  One of the things he taught was method acting and during an exercise done at the workshop, Cassavetes explored acting and race relations.  Having been inspired by the exercise, he went out and created his first independent film featuring the actors at the workshop and shot it with a 16mm handheld camera.

The film was known as ""Shadows"" and although the 1957 was shot and screened to critics but after observing how the audience reacted, Cassavetes contacted his fellow talent two years later and filmed additional scenes and crafted another version of the film which was screened at the Venice Film Festival and winning the Critics Award.  Also, the film went on to become the spearhead for Independent film as Cassavetes funded the film using his own money which he made from various acting gigs and didn't utilize any major talent but utilizing his own talent from his workshop to help make the film possible through improvisation.

As a precursor to the Beat Generation eventually transitioning to the hippie culture, ""SHADOWS"" was a film that took on race during a time that race relations between Caucasian and Blacks were still at an all-time high and focuses on interracial relationships.  So, important that this low budget Independent film was selected for preservation in the United States National Registry by the Library of Congress in 1993 as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""SHADOWS"" is featured in black and white (1:33:1 aspect ratio) and as shot in 16mm film.  It's important to note that at this time, John Cassavetes' first film shows his focus more on the acting talents while in later films, we see his view on cinema and his role as a filmmaker start to emerge.  The film does have its share of dirt and dust and even hair like particles that show up but there is a restoration demonstration of what it took to restore and remaster this film which had not been taken care of and desperately needed repair work.  So, just for what the restoration team were able to accomplish is amazing.

As for audio, audio is presented in Monaural, Dolby Digital 1.0.  The film is center channel driven but for those with a modern receiver can opt to switch the audio to stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""SHADOWS"" is an intriguing film and I can imagine if I put myself in the shoes of the viewer watching it back in 1959, I would imagine that this film could be seen as rebellious a film that invokes realism.  The film's importance which provided that spark and help ignite the independent film movement and showcasing America's breakaway from traditional filmmaking.  People who watched ""SHADOWS"" were inspired to create their own films, not have the expensive talent and to see a film created with a 16mm camera on a low budget but yet still be provocative enough to make people think but also to enjoy.

Using no written screenplay, ""Shadows"" is entirely improvised.  Acting and even camera work seems to be off at times but no surprise as the talents for the film were improvising and the fact that this film was low budget at $40,000 (no doubt a lot back in the late '50s) and only a crew of six people.

But what makes this film work is to see interracial relationships featured in an earlier film from the late '50s, shot a decade before ""To Sir, with Love"", I often think about how people at the time view this film.  In a way, it's quite exciting to know that Cassavetes would create a film that would push the button during those high tension times.

Also, what works is capturing that New York City feel.  Sure, it was done via a low-budget but to see Lelia wandering through New York City, through the park and then see the various parties held by Hugh featuring his friends (who were mostly all Black) and in contrast to a party that Lelia was part of (who were all Caucasian).

Add in the memorable scenes of a so bad it's fun song sung by the Caucasian women who have no talent to the aftermath between Lelia first sexual experience and her words of ""I never imagined it could be so awful"" was surprising.  There are these shorter scenes that you watch and somehow, just be impressed of what was captured on film.

It is important to note that in 1957, a first film was screened for critics.  This film was lost and was recently discovered by Boston University Professor who spent 11 years of his life and a lot of money in trying to find this film.  Carney was originally planned to give commentary for the Criterion DVD release and even offered the film for free.  But according to Carney, Cassavetes' wife has suppressed the film from ever being shown (and claims there is no first film) and the drama going on behind-the-scenes of trying to get this film out to the public is just shocking to read.  But what is surprising is that a film critic who saw the original 1957 film and the 1959 film (which is featured on the DVD and screened in theaters) said the former is much better.  Carney even saying on his website they are essentially two different films and we are left wondering when will we ever see this film.

It would be a shame for Cassavetes fans if they never had a chance to see this film and I just hope somehow in my lifetime and for other Cassavetes fans, we can see his original film someday.

Overall, ""SHADOWS"" is an enjoyable film but definitely far from being a Cassavetes masterpiece.  This is a precursor to showing how his style of filmmaking would develop overtime but for the most part, his importance in helping jumpstart independent films with a low budget.  An important film that I'm glad to see included on the"" John Cassavetes Five Films"" DVD box set.

The box set is highly recommended!",1265328000,5,7045,4.731147540983606
805493,2,6304192339,"They say Cassavettes opened the door for the independent film movement with Shadows, and that is probably why any importance is still attached to this film - that and the fact that Cassavettes had a long and important career after this.

This movie is a true 'beat' movie: sparse jazz soundrack, late 50s/early 60s cool.  This had been done before and with much better results: Shadows was made in 1959, same year as Jean Luc-Godard's BREATHLESS, also a 'beat' film which has been credited for heralding in the French New Wave Movement of the early 60s.  Before that in 1957, French director Louis Malle did ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS, Miles Davis doing the soundtrack.  Either of these movies is better than ""Shadows"".  What gave Shadows distinction is that Cassavetes seemed to have applied the concept of jazz music (improvisation) to the movie.  What an idea!  Characters going through a scene without a script (mostly), just playing the dialogue as they felt it.  I probably don't need to tell anyone who has made it all the way through this movie - the idea sounds better on paper.

With actors just kind of 'wingin it' all over the place, doing to film what jazz musicians were doing to music (TRYING TO at least), the bare-bones story line is about the only thing keeping this flick together:  light skinned woman with black brothers brings white boyfriend home.  He doesn't react correctly and is 'thrown' out of the house.  Other brothers include singer and manager, and Benny who spends time trying to pick up chicks with his friends and gets beat up in the end.

With this film, we learn that 'expirimental' doesn't necessarily translate to 'enjoyable'.  The characters in the film aren't that likeable, scenes and character relationships aren't that believable, the editing work looks like that of a high school film student and the acting is like improv high school drama class taken out into different locations in the city.  No wonder this film heartened other film makers.  They were thinking - if he can do THIS, anyone can make a movie!  And they were right.

Interviews with Lelia Goldini, the main actress, and associate producer, Seymour Cassei, shed some light on the times and what Cassavetes was trying to do.",1254787200,5,2231,4.841688654353562
805494,3,6304192339,"In many ways, the filmic career of independent filmmaking legend John Cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock, the consummate studio director.  Where Hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle, Cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally. Where every element in a Hitchcock shot is composed immaculately, Cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt, or what it conveyed, emotionally. Hitchcock's tales were always plot-first narratives, with the human element put in the background. Cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films. If some things did not make much sense logically, so be it.
  One can see this even from his very first film, 1959's Shadows, filmed with a 16mm handheld camera, on a shoe string budget of about $40,000, in Manhattan, with Cassavetes' acting workshop repertory company, and touted as an improvisatory film. The story is rather simple, as it follows the lives of three black sibling Manhattanites- Benny (Ben Carruthers)- a trumpeter and no account, Hugh (Hugh Hurd)- a washed up singer, and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni)- the younger sister of both. The film's three main arcs deal with Hugh's failures as a nightclub crooner, and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny's perambulations in an about Manhattan with his two no account pals; and Lelia's lovelife- first with a white boy Tony (Anthony Ray), who does not realize light-skinned Lelia's race, even after bedding her; then with stiff and proper Davey (Davey Jones), who may be a misogynist.
  In the first arc, nothing much happens, except dark-skinned Hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs, and opening shows for girly acts. He dreams of making it big in New York, or even Paris, but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill, for the one time we actually get to hear him sing, he shows he's a marginal talent, at best. That Rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work. But, this is the least important of the three arcs.... While this film is better overall than, say, Martin Scorsese's first film, a decade later, Who's That Knocking At My Door?- another tale of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers, it has none of the brilliant moments- acting-wise nor cinematographically- that that film has. It also is not naturalistic, for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve, especially in film, although the 1950s era Manhattan exteriors, at ground level, is a gem to relive. While Shadows may, indeed, be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit, it certainly is nowhere near a great film. Parts of it are preachy, poorly acted, scenes end willy-nilly, almost like blackout sketches, and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle. All in all it's a very sloppy job- especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film, as Cassavetes proved that as a director, at least in his first film, he was a good actor. The only reason for anyone to see Shadows is because Cassavetes ultimately got better with later films, and this gives a clue as to his later working style.
  The National Film Registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as `culturally significant'. This is all in keeping with the credo of art Cassavetes long championed, as typified by this quote: `I've never seen an exploding helicopter. I've never seen anybody go and blow somebody's head off. So why should I make films about them? But I have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way. I've seen people withdraw. I've seen people hide behind political ideas, behind dope, behind the sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and I've myself done all these things. So I can understand them. What we are saying is so gentle. It's gentleness. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems.' That this film is `culturally significant' is true, but that truth is not synonymous with its being `artistically significant'. It is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives.",1221609600,18,4282,5.00561797752809
805495,4,6304192339,"The remarkable, sometimes infuriating, often brilliant films of John Cassavetes occupy a unique position in American cinema... Low-budget, partly improvised, inspired by cinma verit documentary, and related to underground film, they have nevertheless frequently managed to reach a wide and profoundly appreciative audience...

After drama studies, the young Cassavetes quickly made his name as an unusually unrefined, intense actor, often appearing in films about disaffected, rebellious youth such as ""Crime in the Streets"" and ""Edge of the City.""

Setting up an actors' workshop, he worked to transform an improvisational experiment into his feature debut... The result, ""Shadows,"" taking three years to complete and partly financed by his performances in TV's Johnny Staccato, was a breakthrough in American cinema... About the effect of racism on an already fraught relationship between two black men and their sister, two of whom pass for white, the film is impressive for its irregular, seemingly formless style and naturalistic performances...

805497,4,6304192339,"Cassavetes was just warming up when he made this in the late '50s, but what a debut!  He'd have better actors and more focused scenes in future movies, but the willingness to tackle intense subjects in unexpected ways is already here in full force.  Race isn't so much the issue in ""Shadows"" as it is an occasion for exploring a whole range of folks uncomfortable in their own skins, from the 'racist' lover who wants Lelia back to the goofy hoods in Ben's gang.  Cassavetes is especially sensitive to the way that people who are forced to conform to any of society's ideas--about the artist, the intellectual or the racial outsider--can be violent in turn towards others.  A great taste of the films to come!",1037318400,5,709,4.648
805498,5,6304192339,"In constrast to the sanitized images of 1950s television and motion pictures, SHADOWS is like a breath of fresh air. It's independent filmmaking at its best. You'll find no silly ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best"" plots here. Instead, you have characters that respond and speak like regular people. This is in large part because Cassavetes allowed the actors to improvise their dialog. This is particularly true for the black characters in the film, because they aren't constrained by an outsider's view of them.
There are several stories in the film, but perhaps the most interesting is that of Lelia (played by Lelia Goldoni). Living in a Manhattan apartment with her two brothers, she's somewhat naive of the world. At a party she meets Tony and they soon hit it off. Just as quickly, things start to sour between them. If it already isn't bad enough, all hell breaks loose, when Tony is unable to conceal his shock when he discovers that the olive complexioned Lelia is actually black.
In a Hollywood film, this scenario would have been thrown under the rug or handled in a stiff and artificial manner (like ISLAND IN THE SUN). Fortunately, we get a much more interesting and realistic view of the situation. Granted some of the dialog might be a bit on the nose at times, but when the improv works, it works fabulously.
One of the best scenes in the film involves Lelia on a date. Without revealing too much, her dialog is a killer. John Sayles couldn't have written it any crisper.
As the whole, the cast is very good. All of the major players have the same first names as their respective characters. Rupert Crosse (who later received an Academy Award nomination for his role in The Reivers) is very funny in this film. Hugh Hurd (father of Michelle Hurd on Showtime's ""Leap Years"") is very believable as a frustrated vocalist who is also the caring older brother of Lelia. Also look out for Lynn Hamilton (perhaps best known for her recurring role on ""Sanford & Son"") in a small role.
The film is raw, but like sushi there is much to savour here. Just sit back, relax and pop this movie into your machine. A little patience will go a long way with this gem. Check it out.",998092800,10,2189,4.615384615384615
7864418,3,6304192339,"I love cassevettes and usually am really into a directors early works but for some reason have never been able to get into this one. I understand the significance of the low budget approach as well as the on location filming, and the controversial for the time, racial themes . There is not much of any of the auterisitic signature techniques that i love from his later work like Opening Night or Woman Under the Influence.
I do see Cassavettes as a true hustler of the movie business. I mean hustler in a good way in that he would do odd commercial projects to help push forward what he really wanted to do. The interesting thing about his actor projects is that as corny as some of them were they were usually very entertaining like the bad remake of The Killers.
As for this early attempt as a director i am not a fan of it. I feel the same way about Too Late Blues. I feel he really found his voice with Husbands which was destroyed by Roger Ebert and has for some reason not received the recognition it deserves.
The criterion box set that came out should of left out shadows and replaced it with Husbands.
The main aspect of Shadows i dislike is the main character is unintentionally laughable because he looks just like late 1960's Lou Reed. I just cant take him seriously and he tries to act too tough and again it is just a bad performance.  I am rarely negative in my reviews and i think Cassavettes is a true master. I do feel however that sometimes an artist just one day gets it and that with Cassavettes there is not much worth in the material that came before the enlightenment.",1520553600,,1593,4.363636363636363
