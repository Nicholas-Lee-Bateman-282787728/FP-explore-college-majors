8279908,4,B001AVTO14,"Good twists, just the right amount of action. Not quite as good as the original Infernal Affairs (then again, very few films are!), but still well worth watching.",1470700800,,162,4.821428571428571
8279909,5,B001AVTO14,"This is of obviously Part 2 of a 3 part series. I recommend watching the first one (Infernal Affairs), just so you start off from the beginning (duh) Great storyline and very intense and certain parts. The story in this take place before the first movie so you get a little background on the characters. Highly Recommend.",1260403200,2,321,4.649122807017544
