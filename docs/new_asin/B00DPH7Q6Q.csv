8595941,5,B00DPH7Q6Q,I loved it BUT Howard Jones Sounds way better on his CD's and I expected the big time show production and was kind of disappointed considering I love Howard Jones' music.  So I will have to find a better Howard Jones live in concert production.,1504483200,,244,4.4222222222222225
