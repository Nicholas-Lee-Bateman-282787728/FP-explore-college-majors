2174951,3,B00067Z2SM,"I have never felt compelled to get on here and leave anything less than a five star review for any product.  However, I just could not pass up the opportunity to comment on this dvd.

I bought this yesterday, with very high hopes.  First of all, new age is very interesting and relaxing to me, so my tolerance for it is very high.  I enjoy kundalini yoga, so I thought from reading some of the reviews that I would enjoy this dvd.  This instructor is beyond odd, even for someone who enjoys alternative ideas.  Her moaning and groaning throughout the entire thing was just too much.

Her instruction and cueing are great, but her phrases she uses are just over the top.  For example...

""Feel yourself well-rooted like a tree, with your arms like a little bird opening its wings for the first time.  Beautiful willow."" (pant, moan, groan)

""Your treasure box is your greatest possession."" (pant, moan, groan)

""Pour your energy into the Earth.  The Earth can hold it all.""

""Why do we lift the sky?  Because it is not high enough."" (pant, moan, groan)

This dvd is a blend of yoga, kundalini yoga, ballet, stretching and ""trance dance.""  I still think I like the workout, but I sure hope no one comes in and sees me doing the workout.  I'll never hear the end of it as long as I live.

One very positive note, and the reason I bought this in the first place, is the color meditation at the end.  I have studied chakra meditation and this is a wonderful introduction.  It is 10 minutes long and is very effective.  This is done with color filters over the cast.  You can still see the exercisers, but through a color filter corresponding to whatever chakra they are working at that time.

I will probably do this workout from time to time, but I see myself using the color meditation practice very often.  It is the best part of the dvd.  The funny thing about this dvd is..when I finished doing the workout, I actually felt very connected to the Earth and felt very confident.  However, the instructor's style is just a little much, so if you allow yourself to become distracted by her over the top style, it can ruin the entire experience.",1145318400,28,2140,4.476683937823834
2174952,4,B00067Z2SM,"I like to treat myself to a more relaxing workout on Fridays and this is it!  This is a feel-good workout that has smalls elements of cardio, toning and stretching.  The instructor takes you on a journey through 4 elements - earth, air, fire and water and along that way she gives you beautiful visualizations.  To some the instructor might seem a bit ""out there"" - but I try to just let go, enjoy myself and go along with it.  Overall, it's a great work-out experience.",1120780800,6,470,4.430232558139535
2174953,5,B00067Z2SM,"This is an awesome video! The moves are relaxing yet toning. Ms. de Phillipo, if you read this review, could you make another video and incorporate Kundalini Waist circles into the routine.  (to me, that is the move where you are sitting on the floor and are ""mixing a huge bowl that is between your legs"").  I have never seen them in a DVD before.  Very happy with this DVD!  And I like the things she says, like ""reaching for your goals and dreams.""",1112313600,8,451,4.333333333333333
2174954,5,B00067Z2SM,"This is a great workout that combines aerobics with simplified Qi Gong/Chi Kung, tai Chi, yoga, kundalini & hatha yoga using 4 background ladies of different cultures, one who is senior for modifications. The music was perfect, slower when the pace was slower & faster w/great beat for earth for example. The set is beautiful room with drapes, etc. The music is new age & changes with the type of element as you exercise: earth, air, fire & water for a total of 45 min with a 15 min color meditation after.
She's very encouraging throughout without being annoying. She's easy to follow & goes slow at first, then goes normal speed so you have no trouble following along. Almost all the exercises incorporates stretching w/o you realizing, so you always feel more energy & more relaxed after every single one. You will sweat though, especially in the fire section, warm up workout your legs in earth, work your arms in air, cool down & relax in water.
This was one of my first workouts to start getting myself into an exercise routine since the pace, her & the music kept me from being bored, I felt more stretched out & energized & I didn't get bored after replying over & over.
She points out YOUR left/right, not hers. She uses great analogies such as climbing a mountain, shooting a bow, etc. so you don't feel like you're doing mindless aerobics, but doing Qi Gong movements that have helped Asian people achieve their longevity for thousands of years.
Check ""Dr Beth T Cholette ""doctor_beth""  review on the VHS version since she wrote a great review that I totally agree with.
To a reviewer who complained about Stephanie panting, I never noticed her doing it at all, only a little strain & breathing a little more deeply during the fast aerobics or her voice muffled slightly when she was doing a standing fwd bend (her head meeting her knees/hands touching toes.) The reason is, unlike most workouts, she teaches as SHE does along with you, she takes no breaks, her voice is always relaxed, eloquent. I like to see the reviewer speak so well while doing this workout. I love best when the teacher speaks as they do it rather then a voice over.
To this day this is still one of my favorites.

There are pictures on Stephanie's site tantrictoning com & more info about her training & experience.

2174957,5,B00067Z2SM,"Let me preface this review by telling you that I hate working out and finding a workout that I can enjoy was quite a challenge.  This workout changed it for me.  With soothing music, great dialogue, and easy to do exercises, I found that working out can be fun, not a chore.",1390176000,,274,4.25
2174958,5,B00067Z2SM,"Love this workout. It's a combo of yoga , toning and cardio and also meditation.  Very easy to follow . I wish she had other releases but I see,there is nothing new by her as of yet.",1379894400,,182,3.918918918918919
2174959,5,B00067Z2SM,"This is a blend of yoga, gentle aerobics, and stretching. Nothing ""hardcore"" just an uplifting and flowing workout. I wish there were more like this out there.",1378598400,,159,4.925925925925926
2174960,5,B00067Z2SM,"This workout is from 15 years ago and I think now that it was ahead of it's time in the world of workouts for home use! I just did this one and really loved it! It was an excellent mind-body yoga and toning routine and Stephanie uses a lot of verbal visualizations to help you get the most out of each pose and movement. It was lovely and the set, music and even the outfits of the backgrounders were pretty good for that long ago-not too dated. I am glad I discovered this one and gave it a try. I may not have been ""ready"" for this one when it was new-but I am at a place where I am now! I really wish Stephanie would put out another workout on DVD ! For all you  Trekkies out there, I felt like I was Deana Troi in the Holladeck doing this one! ha ha I do Like it!",1362009600,6,767,3.8544303797468356
2174961,5,B00067Z2SM,"I bought this workout on VHS years ago and like it so much I decided to get it on DVD.  I like the DVD because it has chapters.  There are 3 workout sections and I can do all 3 or do them individually if I'm short on time.  There's also a color meditation that is on a separate chapter.

It works all parts of the body and is aerobic and toning at the same time.  I love the creative visualization affirmations she states while doing certain movements.  It's a mind-body-soul workout that you can do in your bare feet and get good results from.  Highly recommend.",1357084800,2,563,4.254716981132075
2174962,5,B00067Z2SM,"I used to own this on VHS and loved it. I just recently bought it on DVD . It's a great combination of aerobics, yoga and even a meditation.  It leaves me feeling fantastic and calm .",1354579200,,183,3.945945945945946
2174963,2,B00067Z2SM,"I keep trying to like this DVD, but the corny comments and the constant view of Stephanie making sure her ""fake and purchased"" breast are seen by the world distract from a good workout.  By no means am I a prude or someone that doesn't appreciate the human body, but this is ridiculous.  Her nipples are almost hanging out.  I just don't understand why this was encouraged or even tolerated by anyone editing or directing the workout.",1329696000,4,434,4.6103896103896105
2174964,5,B00067Z2SM,"I love this workout.  It's an engaging workout that utilizes powerful yet fluid movements from many traditions.  Although I said, 'imagination' in my title, I think how she guides the movements are integral to mental and emotional aspects of health and healing.  She risks being different, Thank God, from the more traditional exercise videos.  I feel invigorated and positive and am ready to take on the day.  I'm an acupuncturist and will be touting this to my patients.  Thank you Stephanie!",1329004800,2,494,5.037037037037037
2174965,5,B00067Z2SM,I had the video..but I moved and left it in storage. Had to have it again! Got the DVD and am pleased as punch! Stephanie is so tranquilizing. You will feel great physically and the BONUS color meditation will leave you feeling so  calm and ready to take on your day! Love it!,1323648000,,276,4.2075471698113205
2174966,5,B00067Z2SM,"I am particular about exercise and dislike the usual boring music and constant chattering of instructors.  Also, I have watched a lot of yoga DVDs and been to many yoga classes.  This is the only one I will ever go back to--the I have been waiting for!!! I love the instructor. She is inspiring in a mother earth kind of way. I love that its not just poses but more a set of flowing moving dancelike routine. This is how I like my yoga -calm,  breathing through,  stretching,  moving.  It makes me feel like a goddess. The only thing that could be better os if it took place outdoors in a scenic surrounding, but other than that it is perfect for me!!!",1313625600,2,652,4.30327868852459
2174967,5,B00067Z2SM,"This is a great workout!  It's definitely for women and although Stephanie can be a bit full of estrogen at times, it provides great exercise and meditation with no stress to the joints.  She uses all the elements, earth, wind, fire, and water, to get the body moving.  The 40-minute workout just flies by!",1272412800,,306,4.62962962962963
2174968,5,B00067Z2SM,"Nice change from regular stretch routines. Somewhat like dynamic stretching. Definitely get value for your dollar. There is narration throughout. It is pretty harmless and sometimes helpful. If you prefer silence, mute and watch.",1252022400,,229,5.764705882352941
2174969,5,B00067Z2SM,"I rely on this workout for when I just can't face jumping and dancing, but want something energizing and even a bit meaningful. I work up a sweat, get stretched out, and mentally motivated to start my day each time I follow these routines. If I don't have much time, I'll only do one or two sections and save the rest for later. Both the visualizations and encouraging words, while they seem like they should feel sappy, somehow work within the context of the workout. It's one of my staples.",1250294400,2,492,4.477777777777778
2174970,5,B00067Z2SM,"What a lovely workout! This is a highly underrated workout in the world of ""Biggest Loser"" and such. It's a shame that such a beautiful, gentle and effective workout has not gained more notoriety the last 13 years!

I love the focus on elements and the visualizations. I even love her cute little couplets. This is a nice fusion workout to do on quiet day. I primarily do fusion workouts of Kundalini yoga, ballet, hula and Pilates. This is an excellent addition to my collection.",1241136000,,480,4.647058823529412
2174971,5,B00067Z2SM,"I love this workout. It has a unique blend of visualization and energizing movements. I agree that the phrases she uses are a bit over the top. I watched it once without following along to get a feel for it before trying it. I laughed so hard.

When you are actively participating and visualizing the pictures Stephanie paints, the feeling is very different. For the majority of the work out, you are relaxed and calm. What difference from having other trainers yelling at you to keep going. The 45 minutes goes by fast and you don't even notice you are working out until you are done. When you have completed it, you know you have done something good for yourself.

I would consider this to be a light workout. It makes for a great off-day or morning routine. When done in the morning, my day seems to be brighter and more relaxed. I feel this is due to the grounding and centering throughout the program.

I don't often do the color meditation. Not that it is a bad meditation but it is so relaxing that I often fall asleep. Since this is part of my morning routine, falling asleep causes me to run late and completely ruins the balance I had just gained.",1238716800,5,1157,4.422535211267606
2174972,5,B00067Z2SM,"I was pleasantly surprised at this DVD. I was looking for a toning workout and this dvd does that but it also gets you working quite at hard at times without being too challenging. I suffer from Fibromyalgia and have lost alot of fitness and this dvd is helping me to regain that again and putting my curves back where they belong!
My only complaint is that the commentary can sometimes be off putting.",1233705600,2,402,4.445945945945946
2174973,5,B00067Z2SM,"I actually found this in a bin at the local Dollar Store, and figured 'Why not?'. It didn't look too difficult or too taxing. It turns out to be one of the better dollars I've spent.

For some background, I have chronic pain problems that make it difficult to find a workout that I can do without hurting myself, or having to stop in the middle because I'm hurting too much to continue. I can complete this workout without more than a few minor aches, and I feel incredibly energized at the end. What's more, my body doesn't hurt much for awhile after finishing. It's not overly strenuous, so I don't imagine I'm burning too many calories, but for the level I'm at, this DVD is a Godsend.
I would suggest this to anyone who is not working out because of chronic pain (I'm hoping I can move on to harder workouts as my level is built up) or who would like a light, energizing workout. It really surprised me how much better I started feeling as I started doing this. The lines are a little hokey sometimes, but it works.",1230508800,3,1019,4.335078534031414
2174974,5,B00067Z2SM,"Tantric Toning Workout is a very easy yet envigorating work out DVD. Great even for beginners.
I usually give up on work out videos because they are either too hard or want you to sit down, stand up repeatedly. But with Tantric Toning you are standing the whole time.
By the end of the 50 minute work out I always feel relaxed. And at the same time I have worked up a sweat.
Very unique low impact workout. I'm sure I will be using this for months/years to come.",1230249600,2,462,4.202247191011236
2174975,5,B00067Z2SM,"Wow, what a great workout. In this program Stephanie really takes you to that special place we all belong. Her dialog is the best there is out there, I really enjoy it in the morning before going to work. The routine is very well put together and the stage is beautiful. I recommend this program to anyone, it is simple and yet powerful, take it light or raise the  intensity you will feel great afterwords.",1229212800,3,407,4.426666666666667
2174976,5,B00067Z2SM,"Throughout this lovely, elementally-themed workout, Stephanie de Phillipo exhorts you to use your powers of visualisation. You'll imagine scooping up armfuls of earth energy or bathing in glowing fire energy. You'll glide your hands over a glass pond, wave in the wind like a tree or become a waterfall or a sparkling diamond. These visualisations combine with strong, expressive movements to give a powerful workout for mind and body.
Unlike the previous reviewer I didn't find De Phillipo's attire at all offensive. I suppose when it comes to clothing people have different standards. I do agree though that vocally she can come across as a little over the top. She talks all the way through, her delivery is dramatic, and once or twice her voice gets a bit loud. But to me the benefits of the workout vastly outweighed the odd cringe that this caused.
The movements of the earth section are rooted in horse stance and plies. The air section covers arms and balance (with frequent references to flying). The fire section has familiar aerobic moves and the water section is cooling and flowing with hints of qi gong and yoga.
I always enjoy myself when I use this DVD. I break a light sweat and the time flies. At the finish I feel stretched, toned and uplifted.
European readers may be interested to know that it plays fine in region 2.",1222128000,4,1338,4.746781115879829
2174977,5,B00067Z2SM,"I stumbled upon this toning workout video about 10 years ago and it's remained my favorite since that time.  I was ecstatic when I found it on DVD a couple of years ago as I no longer had a VCR and missed doing the workout.  It may not be as strenuous and calorie burning as other workouts, but it does tone your body and helps you focus.  Whenever I do this workout it in the morning, I am more focused and my body is more energetic for the rest of the day.  I was having problems with my feet from all the walking I do and doing this workout also helped alleviate that stress.  I highly recommend it as a part of your workout regimen!",1212192000,4,636,4.056
2174978,5,B00067Z2SM,"Oddly enough, this $2 DVD is moderately useful.  Don't think for a second you're getting a real workout.  It's definitely all toning and stretching, if you couldn't tell from the title.  But it is a unique way to work your muscles and a nice change from the usual motivational blondies.  I'd recommend it to anyone.",1209427200,5,315,4.672727272727273
2174979,5,B00067Z2SM,"January 16, 2017  - Think that it's about time that I added this to my current exercise routine - dance fitness and swimming/water aerobics!  Please see my comments below dating back to 2008. I am actually looking forward to revisiting this DVD with a  new body sense.  Based on how I felt after a deep tissue massage last week (ouch!) and the comment by the massage therapist that my muscles were very tight, I realize that I need to be more mindful about stretching and I am hoping that this DVD will help with good, all over stretching.
From 2008:
I tested this DVD out this morning, and I have to say, that it was GRRREAT!  I loved the movements. They were easy to learn, but certainly beneficial. I have felt good since the morning.  Incorporating breathing really helps, and when you can master the movements easily, all the better.  The instructor's voice is soothing, but not too ""ethereal"".
It is a wonderful head to toe workout and stretch, and it will certainly help your overall circulation.  It is low impact, but with a cardio segment. It is all done while standing - no mat exercises, so for those who grimace at getting out the mat and dropping to the floor, I recommend it highly.

December 20, 2008 UPDATE  This dvd will energize you for the day.  In addition, you will feel that you have taken a good deal of air into your lungs which helps with singing - at least I think that it does.  Recently I began using two-1 lb. exercise balls or one 2 lb. pilates exercise balls with almost all of the routines. The soft plastic balls are easy to hold and they give you a little more of a workout, plus they seem to help with some of the balancing exercises and deep ""lunge"" stretches. I cannot say enough good things about this dvd. I think that it helps in so many ways - you WILL feel more positive about yourself, more focused and energized, but not in a ""hypercaffeinated"" way.  This dvd is a way for you to prepare for a challenging day ahead or to separate work or hectic family life from time for yourself.  Give this a couple of tries before you judge it.  If you find the instructor not to your taste for some reason, remember that the focus should be on you.  You need to give this your all, and soon after you start using this dvd, you won't be looking at the dvd - you'll be concentrating on following Stephanie's direction and getting the most out of the routine. You will feel the stretch in your back and hips (the hip stretches feel great!) Your arms and back will get a good workout, and you will trim inches off of your waist, torso and back.  Your posture will improve as well. This dvd would probably be especially beneficial in combination with walking, using a treadmill or stepper, or in addition to swimming or water aerobics.  This dvd is a hidden gem!
January 14, 2009 Love It! Love It! Love It!  This workout gets a real boost when you add the pilates exercise balls to the routine.  You can really get an extremely good stretch and workout from this dvd.
March 15, 2009 Still love it!  All I can say is that I wish that I could fit in the time more often to do this routine.  I have now begun adding two handheld soft 3-lb. weights to much of the routine.  This really takes up the workout a few notches, but I did feel some immediate soreness in the middle part of my back during the exercise. I continued exercising and worked through most of it except for some minor stiffness. I am wondering if the use of the soft weights contributed to it...I would caution against the use of weights for the entirety of this routine to anyone with limited mobility or strength.  A great workout!  And here's one of those ""TMI's"" - you may find yourself grunting through parts of this if you really try to work your hardest.  Have fun!
November 30, 2010
I still think that this is a good workout even after an injury.
Recently I injured my left knee and ankle.  I had to ""lie low"" for a little while and it has been a slow recovery, but I can see how this dvd can be part of the recovery process.  The difference is that for the time being at least I need to be mindful of every move to make sure that the position or twisting of my body isn't painful. I also need to work very supportive tie shoes with orthotics (no more crocs for now!)  I find some of the stretches, postures and movements extremely unique and great for visualization - for example, ""climbing the highest mountain"", aiming your bow towards your goal and hitting it bullseye and ""flying"".  I still love this dvd very much.  I see that the price has increased tremendously.  It must be in short supply.
Give this dvd a whirl.  You may enjoy it!
January 3, 2011 I am going to get back to using this dvd.  It's been awhile.  I don't know why I stop doing what works.....human nature, I suppose.",1205366400,5,4790,4.361894024802706
2174980,5,B00067Z2SM,"This is a routine much different than any of the other toning and workout videos out there. It is a mix of Tai Chi, Yoga, and Ballet that's quite entertaining. Its like you enter this fantasy world: be playful with it and it's lots of fun and you'll feel sexy if you go with it. It's similar to Shiva Rea's flow yoga where you'll dance and connect with the elements of earth, air, fire, and water. There is an absolutely lovely 15 minute color meditation as an extra. Stephanie dePhillipo is a little dramatic (and shows a lot of cleavage) and the students are right out of the 80's with their high thigh leotards, but if you can get over that it is really quite fun and so much different than any other DVD out there. The whole routine is done standing and you will work all of your body muscles. Not really an aerobic exercise, but works your muscles and gets lovely energy moving throughout your body. I liked it!",1197158400,4,916,4.362573099415204
2174981,5,B00067Z2SM,"I enjoy working out at home and when I read the other reviews about this blended workout, it sounded like a DVD that would hold my interest.
I have worked out with the DVD 2 times so far and it grew on my the second time. The first time, I wasn't sure that I was getting a ""true"" toning workout, but I felt it in my arms the next day!  There are lots of arm, thigh and balance segments.  Abs are worked the whole way through by the hip shakes, rolls and leg lifts.  The instructors uses Tai Chi, ballet and yoga terms, but they are explained, so you will not feel lost.
At first I thought that some of the encouraging remarks by the instructor were a little hokey, but after truly listening the second time, they were heartfelt and helped me start the day on a positive note.  Nothing wrong with being told you're a Beautiful Goddess first thing in the morning!
The movements are all well instructed and not so fast that you use momentum as opposed to your muscles.
Overall, I give this toning workout all 5 stars",1195084800,11,1013,4.260416666666667
2174982,5,B00067Z2SM,"I feel that this is a wonderful start for most people getting into Yoga, Tae Chi, and any Mind / Body workouts.. Especially the color Meditation at the end.  I have Stephanie's Stress Free workout on VHS so that is how long I have had it.  I bring it out again and again. It has been some time now since I last workout with it. Maybe 5yrs.  But, I have now been diagnosed with arthritis, am 58 and tried going to the gym, I cannot bear the pain on the machines etc.. so I decided to review Tantric Toning and some other yoga tapes I have.  I have to say , even though this is stress free workout, you still work up a sweat, the calming of her voice and the exercise ladies with her, with one doing alternative moves for those with problems was more than helpful.  I came on here to see if there were more of her workouts.  Now I find them in DVD.  Thanks , Stephanie you have given me hope to a better life with my new workouts for my body.",1171497600,5,940,4.021505376344086

2174984,4,B00067Z2SM,"I found Tantric Toning to be an interesting blend of workout styles, namely low-impact aerobics, yoga, and Tai Chi. It reminded me a bit of Petra Kobler's BREATHE, but unlike that video, you don't have to repeatedly ""take it from the top,"" which I find to be boring. Instead, this workout includes a very wide variety of different movements, flowing from one to the next. The workout begins with an 8-minute warm-up focused on ""being present."" This section consists mainly of simple standing poses such as horse, a basic pose in which your feet are spread and your knees soft. There are also plies, hip movements, and ankle circles to warm up the lower half of your body.

The main body of the workout consists of four sections which flow seamlessly from one to the next. The first, Earth (8 minutes), continues the standing poses for slightly more intense stretches, such as triangle pose. The Air section (8 minutes) is similar and adds some balance moves such as leg lifts. The third section, Fire (10 minutes), is both the longest and the most fast-moving. This segment provides low-impact aerobics: you'll do poses such as bow and arrow (similiar to warrior pose), but you'll move through them very quickly. The arms are thoroughly worked in this section, as most of the poses require them to be held up at shoulder level or higher. Finally, the workout ends with Water, a 7-minute cool down. The poses here are more recognizable from traditional hatha yoga, including standing forward bend and variations on tree pose (called waterfall and water droplet here).

The total workout is about 41 minutes in length, but the video ends with a 15-minute ""Color Meditation."" This is a seated meditation (either in a simple cross-legged position or hero's pose) focused on color:  as a lens filter fills the screen with color, instructor Stephanie talks about the positive and negative emotions associated with that color, going through red, green, yellow, blue, and ending with white. I usually don't enjoy meditation, but I was pleasantly surprised that the 15 minutes passed very quickly. Overall, this workout is definitely ""stress free"" as it promises. Although the toning benefits are probably limited, you will raise your heart rate, particularly during the Fire section. This is a nice program to use on weekend or other light days, and it can be performed with or without the color meditation at the end.",1151366400,29,2410,4.931034482758621

8040022,5,B00067Z2SM,"This is a great workout routine. The things she says throughout feel a little cheesy to me, but it's okay. I like the movement and stretching involved in this workout. She goes through different workouts based on the elements (earth, air, fire, water) and they are very well thought out. I likes all of them but fire kicks my butt from time to time, which is probably a good thing.",1498521600,,381,4.457142857142857
8040023,4,B00067Z2SM,"This easy to follow standing workout is a good stretch for hips and shoulders.  I had a hard time getting past her catch phrases, sighs, and the dated outfits, but I felt great at the end of the workout.  I had the video tape version when it came out and don't remember being annoyed with her instructions then, so I guess dvd workout sessions have evolved quite a bit over the years!",1496275200,,384,4.319444444444445

8040025,5,B00067Z2SM,"This is the best toning workout on the market. Stephanie's workout is pretty easy as workouts go, but the positive reinforcement woven into the mix gives a boost of extra energy and an ""I can do it!"" feeling to your day. It's better than a cup of smooth mocha and it will leave you toned, limber, and sleek. This is not a building big muscles, must pump iron type of workout.",1458518400,,375,4.295774647887324
8040026,5,B00067Z2SM,"This has long been (for over a decade) one of my favorite workout routines. These days I primarily use it on my ""rest"" day and/or when I need a lighter routine when my knees are acting up. Its combination of yoga, Tai Chi, and aerobics offers an energizing routine that stretches out your body, calming your mind, and raising your heart rate. It's not as intense as other routines I do, but still offers me health benefits that I appreciate.",1453593600,,441,4.525
