8034256,4,B0002XL284,"An odd, somehat dry, yet informative English documentary that focuses on the recording of various representative tracks from the period 69-72, including ""Space Oddity"", ""Life On Mars"", ""Queen Bitch"", ""John I'm Only Dancing,"" etc.

It is interesting to see how Woody Woodmansey composed his drum parts with subtle strategies, and the same for Trevor Bolder.  And of course Mick Ronson.  Also Rick Wakeman--but beware the section on him becomes a bit cheesy.  One really gets an appreciation of the class of the Spiders' musicianship.  With second rate musicianship this never would have been possible.

Aside from the musicians, various hardworking record producers and studio musicians are interviewed with their perspectives on Bowie's composition, etc.  One music critic offers incorrect factual info about Bowie...

Only watch this if you're interested in the technical side of this music, or if you are a rabid fan.",1111795200,13,919,5.3776223776223775
