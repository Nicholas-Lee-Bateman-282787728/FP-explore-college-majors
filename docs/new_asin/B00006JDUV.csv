1779757,5,B00006JDUV,Great viewing for children and adults alike. For once a great non-violent show where children can learn the value of friendship and how to work together as a team. Highly recommended.,1036454400,5,183,4.935483870967742
1779758,5,B00006JDUV,"Hamtaro is the coolest little hamster. Him and his friends get into alot of mischief. Hamtaro's friends are Oxnard,Boss,Bijou,Pashmina,Dexter,Howdy,Jingle,Elder Ham,Pepper,Auntie Vive,Maxwell,Panda,Penelope,Capper,and Snoozer. Laura has just moved in the neighborhood and meets alot of people such as Kana who is the owner of Oxnard. So the episodes in this DVD are when Hamtaro meets up with with all his friends. All the hamsters make a group called the Ham-Hams. Join Hamtaro and friends while go on crazy adventures. Thats it for now. Bye!",1033776000,3,543,5.634146341463414

1779773,5,B00006JDUV,"Hamtaro is one of the few cartoon shows that I truly enjoy.  Unlike many others of its time, Hamtaro is decent and hints teamwork and learning to children.
I'm twenty years old, and I may be just a big geek/nerd, but I love this show.  I would recommend it to anyone.",1317945600,,267,4.215686274509804

You like anime.
You like non-violent anime
You love animals
You love incredibly cute animals.",1208649600,,153,4.5
1779787,5,B00006JDUV,I bought this not too long ago after finding it in a discount section. It had been years sinse It had been canceled from tv. I must say that it's just as good as it was when it was on TV. Hamtaro is adorable. I love all of the ham-hams.,1194825600,,236,3.74
1779788,4,B00006JDUV,"I bought my first Hamtaro DVD as a present for a friend who has a sweet tooth for cute little animals, and then got a copy to satisfy my own curiosity as an anime fan (plus the DVD was on special). I must say I enjoyed what I saw.

First of all, it IS cute, but not absolutely disgustingly cute - it's just a visual style that you quickly get used to.

Second, even though it is technically a ""kids' show"", it's not exactly mindless. Just as in more ""mature"" anime, there are story threads that continue through the series, the characters (while being stereotypes) have some complexity in their relationships, and, thanks to the normal human characters and good background art, there is a sense that the show takes place in (a nice part of) the real world, rather than some airy-fairy cartoon utopia.

Third, visually this show is superior to any US children's cartoon show I've seen recently, especially in the directing (i.e. frame composition & editing) and the painted backgrounds. And, finally, while I would have liked the option of Japanese language and subtitles, I think this DVD is that rare thing - a pretty good dub of a Japanese anime.

The great thing about Hamtaro is that, although it's for kids, it's not as ""dumbed down"" as some shows, which means that adults (parents and, er, *ahem* others) can enjoy it too, and parents don't have to worry about their kids being treated like morons.

The downside: with only three episodes per disc, you only get an hour for your money. Also, due to some quirk with the sound mixing, your ears may suffer from some fatigue after half an hour of Ham-Ham adventuring.",1150934400,18,1620,4.611111111111111
1779789,5,B00006JDUV,"People may think that ""Hamtaro"" is simply a silly, children show, but that is not the case. At some points, the show can be VERY entertaining, and intersting. Yes, the show is mainly targeted to a younnger audience, but the adventures, and life lessons, that Hamtaro and his adorable freinds experience can be very beneficial. My sister is a HUGE fan, and enjoys every show available. I recommend this DVD to anyone out there who has kids or is looking for a sweet, enjoyable, viewing expierence. HBP. ""HAM-Ha!!""",1143158400,2,512,4.829545454545454
1779790,5,B00006JDUV,Hamtaro is better than a real hamster. The show is good for anyone. It's repetitive but understandably so because of the target audience. However I like the games rather than the show. I recommend this show to anyone who adores cute things. A perfect pokemon substitute.,1133827200,,270,4.891304347826087
1779791,5,B00006JDUV,My daughter loves these shows and she is slowly collecting all the toys to go with them. This movie has a positive message and super cute. Girls may like it better than boys. The only drawback is the 'typical' cheaply produced Japanesse anime so don't be looking for very rich production values.,1072224000,2,295,4.6923076923076925
