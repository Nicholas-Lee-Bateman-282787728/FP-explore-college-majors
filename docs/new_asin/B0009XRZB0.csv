8069952,5,B0009XRZB0,"this movie is so much better than 3/4 of the crap on Lifetime, and yet somehow it never saw the light of day, even on Television.  Interesting story line about a guy who comes back to mend his life 15 years later after he witnesses his dad murder his crazy artist friend.  Some great subtle acting, and great stars.. scott cooper.. etc.",1430611200,,336,4.403225806451613
8069953,3,B0009XRZB0,"Ignore the 3 rating: I honestly can't rate this movie cos I've never seen it but for those who care, yes, there is another Water Under the Bridge: With Judy Davis, David Cameron, Robyn Nevin. Australian Mini Series 9 x 1 hour episodes made for TV 1980. Based on Sumner Locke Elliott's novel about life in Sudney 1932-1948 and produced by Shotten Productions. Personally, if anyone can provide a copy I would LOVE to know about it - it was brillo.",1152748800,5,446,4.518518518518518
8069954,1,B0009XRZB0,"The cast listed for this title is wrong!!!!! No Judy Davis etc,,are there two movies with the same title? Anyway,,,,the summary  given about SF and painter/killer plot is correct to my sorrow,,,I bought this because of the favorable reception at the SF festival,,this is junk,,junk of a high order I will grant you but a total waste of viewing time,,so many flashbacks many of which are just a few seconds long,,,an attempt to be overly-arty I presume,,the director is one I will watch (out) for and do my best to avoid,,I was one of the minority who hated Memento and I think this falls in the same ""nothing to say"" genre,,the added DVD feature on making the film is one of the most boring and ineffectual pieces of self indulgence I have witnessed in a long time. Rent if you must but don't expect  anything of the view.",1139875200,4,822,4.547297297297297
8069955,5,B0009XRZB0,"I saw Water Under the Bridge at the San Francisco International Film Festival and really enjoyed it on several levels: the cinematography is excellent, the lighting is beautiful, the locations in SF are very interesting and the story is gripping. By the way, Amazon incorrectly lists the director - the REAL director (also writer and producer) is Clark Brigham. Watch for his next film!",1124236800,7,386,5.046875
