The drawings from scene to scene were a wonderful idea and addition to the story.  Altogether, this was a very nice film and worth the watch.",1534896000,,282,4.264150943396227

8718456,5,B00YJ1GMCG,"I've watched this movie a couple of times now a festivals - where the various honors it received were well deserved. It is a winsome and thought provoking story of awakening that is well told by writer/director Ron Judkins. The cast, in particular Michael O'Keefe, Catherine Dent, Blake Bashoff, and Julie Mond, offer understated performances that both contrast with Sam (the lead character's) world of graphic novels and draw us into the small but richly textured world where mere physical proximity can become the discovery of living in a neighbor-hood. Along the way there is a ripple of subtle drama and poignant humor that makes time spent in this world always engaging and ultimately deeply satisfying.",1437436800,2,708,5.112068965517241
