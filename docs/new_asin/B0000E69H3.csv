1936707,4,B0000E69H3,"This movie takes me back to my childhood memories, with my mother and grandmom watching... i couldn't escape from watching and loving it! Although today i can realize it has some flaws, with a huge cast to support this II world war trough the 70's plot... it get lost a few times. James Caan and Geraldine Chaplin plays double characters which can be confusing. But still a good movie with a grand finale at the eiffel tower!",1082332800,7,425,4.532467532467533

Unfortunately, after ordering this twice I received discs that cannot be played.  I've seen this movie and recommend it highly if a good set of discs can be obtained.

1936743,2,B0000E69H3,"These are two DVDs. The first one was OK, but the second one has problems, and we couldn't watch the movie till the end.  Subtitules not in spanish. The quality of the images is bad.",1394841600,,182,4.2
1936744,4,B0000E69H3,"'Les Uns et les Autres' is possibly the most wonderful and deeply moving film I have ever seen.  It is a film about humanity, about love, war, loss, and redemption.  It spans the years from the mid 1930s to the 1980s, and follows four families , French, American, Russian, and German, and the threads of their lives finally come together at the end.  It is beautiful and sad and contains some wonderful music.  The acting throughout is superb.
The reason I have only given it four stars is because the sound is very uneven.  You really do have to watch it with your thumb on the volume button, and I'm not exaggerating.

I bought this multi-region version because I live in the UK, and I also wanted English subtitles.  It is a 2 disc version and it came new and sealed.  The first disc played all right.  The second disc played all right for about five minutes, after which it went horribly wrong.  Both the sound and picture were continually jumping and sticking, and it was just unwatchable.  Partway through there was about twenty minutes where it was all right, and the last half hour was another unwatchable mess.  I returned this to Amazon and received a refund.  I thought perhaps I had just been unlucky to get a dud dvd, so I bought it again on eBay, and once again the second disc was useless.

I have now bought it again from Amazon France.  This is the original one disc dvd, and it is Region 2, with no subtitles.  Thankfully it plays perfectly from beginning to end, apart from the volume problems I've already mentioned.  There is not a great deal of actual dialogue in this film, and some of it is in English.  As for the rest, I did manage to get the gist of it with my rusty school French.  Some of the most moving and memorable scenes in the film did not have any words, and didn't need them.

When I was looking for this film initially, I think there was a Region 1 version which was also a one-disc version, and I'm guessing that that would play OK all the way through.

So, I cannot recommend this film enough, but be careful which version you buy, although obviously if it's faulty you will get your money back from Amazon.",1394236800,4,2147,4.398477157360406
1936745,1,B0000E69H3,"Although I got the video fast, and the case looked intact, the quality was not good. Especially, the second DVD worked badly, until close to the end, it stoped working and I was unable to watch the end of the movie, very upsetting.",1387152000,,231,4.395348837209302
1936746,5,B0000E69H3,"When I first saw this movie, in the 80's, I was stuck by the gimmick, in this 3 hour saga covering the adventures of three generations of four families (of different nationalities) of using the lead actors and actresses to portray their own children, and then grandchildren. But the highlight of the movie must be the performance of the Russian dancer in his two standout extended dances, one to the music of Ravel's Bolero (which is also the alternate English Title of the movie)
This is a very clever movie, covering pre, during and post World War Two, linking the lives (often unknowingly) of Russian, French, Jewish and American families, and despite it's length, the action and interest never flags. There is a huge cast of well-known top actors, the director is Claude Lelouch, and it is one of my favourite movies of all time.
Unfortunately for some reason it does not seem to be available anywhere in DVD format so when I discovered it on Amazon as a 2pack VHS video I grabbed it.and enjoyed it all over again, and again. Great.",1380067200,,1036,4.666666666666667

1936748,4,B0000E69H3,"Good story, very well directed, great actors, great music, all great
except some problems with subtitles that are missing in some scenes, in French version some subtitles instead of being in English
are in French when the language is German. Also the sound in some parts is extremely low that we can barely hear a word and suddenly very loud, I should say, back to the regular level. However, beside these editing problems, the movie itself is great.",1373673600,,450,4.782051282051282

1936769,5,B0000E69H3,"Have been wanting to get this movie for years and very pleased that I now own it. Only drawback is that it is an Asian pressing and is split over two disks, so the first disk just stops in the middle of a scene... Oh well, I suppose I cannot have everything! :)",1372550400,,261,3.943396226415094
1936770,5,B0000E69H3,"One of  the great but little known movies!!! I will watch it several times.

1936771,4,B0000E69H3,Long long story but interesting. I remembered this movie from my teenage years in Canada and remembered the ending more then anything and just loved the Bolero song.... Watching it as an adult I understood it more as it has alot to do with ww2.,1361836800,,244,4.444444444444445

1936774,5,B0000E69H3,"I first saw this movie when it came out in Portugal in 1982. I was 12 years old and it was the first ""grown up"" movie I had seen.  To this day I remember it as an amazing and powerful story.  It was a history story, a love story, a story of survival.  I am still in love with this film and recommend it to all - yes, some parts could be stronger and at times the story line looses it's way, still it remains a wonderful movie with some great performances and a sweeping view of European history.",1319673600,,495,3.9797979797979797
1936775,5,B0000E69H3,"One of the Best Epic Films from France. The Film tells the stories of 4 families, from Paris, NY, Berlin and Moscow, since the beginning of WWII to the 80's, their lives and their tragedies,  overcome these difficulties to finally all being reunited in a spectacular show at the Eiffel tower's feet listening Ravel's Bolero performed directed, danced and sung by the main characters.

You will enjoy the film If not for the ploy for the music and choreographies. This film could be confusing when some actor plays the part of their own decedents, which is required by the plot to establish that he/she is a next of kin.

it's still  one of those rare films that you will love to watch from time to time, to remember us that we are all humans,  life always ends in a full circle, the music is all around us  and  there is always hope that better times are coming.",1305504000,,862,4.452229299363057
1936776,5,B0000E69H3,"Every film that I have ever seen that has dealt with pre WW2 and the during and after effects all combined together in this amazing and sweeping epic film LES UNS ET LES AUTRES (roughly translated ""These people and the other people"") and released in America under the title BOLERO.It is difficult to give an accurate review of such a film,directed by Claude Lelouch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Man-and-a-Woman/dp/B00007G1ZH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Man and a Woman</a>) because frankly it is overwhelming in it's scope and characters,as it is also a film of music and feeling that evokes the senses,and yet tells a powerful story of people's lives affected by the Holocaust, starting in the 1930's, in four different countries,four different languages, and following the after effects into the 1980's!!!! There is A LOT to take in this movie. One viewing is simply not adequate to express all that is in this film. That it is a tribute to the human spirit and to the power of music is undeniable. The characters in this film are all based from real life, except the names are changed. Some characters I could figure out such as the German Pianist/conductor Karl Kremer, who seemed a composite of Wilhelm Furtwangler (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taking-Sides/dp/B0001DCR0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taking Sides</a>-the film about his complicity with Hitler)and Herbert van Karajan. The Russian ballet dancer who defected to America as Rudolf Nureyev or possibly Mikail Baryshnikov (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Nights/dp/B000GDH9JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Nights</a>-a film based on his defection). The other characters were harder to identify;the failed boxer and the American singer (played by Geraldine Chaplin), and the author who was abandoned on the railroad tracks as a baby! Someone will know who all of these people were that Claude Lelouch places in this tribute to music and humanity. This film is SPECTACLE and I honestly can say that in all my years of watching films,I have NEVER seen anything quite like it. It runs for 177 minutes,just slightly edited from it's original 188 minutes. The music flows from Beethoven,Ravel and Liszt to the contemporary Michel Legrand and Francis Lai. The choreography by the French great Maurice Bejart is astounding. Bejart is well known as the choreographer for the rock group QUEEN'S&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-Rock-Montreal-Live-Aid/dp/B000VZBCWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen Rock Montreal + Live Aid</a>.The film can be a little confusing as certain actors,James Caan, Geraldine Chaplin, Nicole Garcia etc.play dual roles. You must keep up with this this film especially in the third hour when the story shifts into the 1960's and then into the 1980's. It is all there, but don't blink.

I would have never known that this film existed unless a friend had given it to me who said,""Dedicate three hours of your life, non stop, to 'experience' this film!"" SHE WAS RIGHT.This is as epic and grand as any film I have ever seen.",1205280000,15,3182,5.843010752688172
1936777,5,B0000E69H3,"This is a movie that was released when I was six years old, but its main score, Ravel's Bolero, was forever indelibly imprinted in my mind.  My parents introduced me to this movie and when watching it I was completely transported to the era, during and after world war II, when values were different than those of today, life was much simpler and family ties stronger. This movie depicts the lives of three different families who are affected by the vicissitudes of war and how each copes with its multiple effects throughout the different generations.  It's as if the clock is stopped and the observer becomes enveloped in the human drama which is inexplicably intertwined and inexorably real. It is a masterpiece of film making and one of the best French movies I have seen.",1198281600,2,776,4.7407407407407405
1936798,5,B0000E69H3,"I was very glad to find this movie on Amazon. I had first seen it when it originally came out. Back then, I saw it in Italy in Italian.  I was struck by the choice and sequence of events and how they were developed.

Now I have seen the original French version (this copy had subtitles in English) and am happy to say that it was as good as the first time.

The ending was a bit confusing since the actors of the main characters played their role twice, once as the main characters, then as the grown up children of the main characters!

I don't remember getting confused when I saw it the first time in Italian.  But then my French is not as good as my Italian! I have also grown older!!",1179878400,2,688,4.104477611940299

1936800,5,B0000E69H3,"I saw this movie with a dear friend back in 1982 while visiting his family in the Netherlands.  I was in love with the movie and emotionally moved by the story and the music that I desperately wanted to see it again. When I returned to the the US, the movie never came to my hometown's film festival--probably only showed in theatres along our coastal states.  I came across some old journal entries and had a notation about the movie.  I longed to see it again so I went on-line,typed in the title and there is was on DVD!  Cannot wait to see it.",1173744000,6,547,4.230769230769231
1936801,5,B0000E69H3,"This movie moves me very deeply. The first time I saw it was at the cinema. When ended the whole audience applauded for 5 minutes. Nobody seemed to want to leave.

This movie confronts you with the facts that we humans are connected and cannot ignore eachother. While I am writing this review, somewhere there is a baby being born and/or a man being shot. Somewhere in time I might actually meet this baby or the mother/wife/child of this man. If you are aware of this fact you cannot ignore the world around you. Lelouche made us see this by showing the lifes of those families around the globe and how somewhere in time they (their offspring) meet",1171324800,2,649,4.5

1936803,3,B0000E69H3,"I'm from Taiwan.  More than 20 years ago when we watched this movie in the theater, something very unusual happened.  After the ballet dance by Jorge Donn at the palace, the whole audience stood up and applauded.  I mean, the audience at the very theater. It was such a powerful feeling that the audience just couldn't help it.  We all stood up and applauded so hard to express our strong appreciation of his performance, even though we were NOT at the scene .  Therefore, watching this movie became the most impressive experience I've ever had.

His dance for Bolero is such a ""natural"" body move along with Ravel's music tempo, both simple, repetitive, yet ""powerful"" !!

There isn't too much talk in this movie. Yet, the facial expression of each persona, even taken at long shots, tells you what's DEEP inside of them, the sorrow, the confusion, the regret, the compassion .... all silent....

Hope everyone would have a chance to ""feel"" this movie and share the common feelings of these common people.",1168387200,11,1006,4.77456647398844

As an adult watching it again I was struck more by the contrast between the two parts  - the first World War II part where there is very little dialogue and the story is told in pictures and sound seems far more affecting to me. Then it moves into what can seem like a completely different film - more of a French character film with the focus much more on relationships than events.
