1372419,5,B00004Y7S5,"Since I was young, Disney animation has been a staple of some of my favorite watchings.  With the reniassance of disney in 1989  with ""The Little Mermaid,"" my hope to one day work for the Walt Disney Studios and become part of that greaty legacy of animators has kept with me.  Fantasia 2000 was the greatest movie recently that showcased the talents of Disney and what animation truly can be!  I saw Fantasia 2000 6 times in IMAX and regular theaters.  The first Fantasia was the earliest film I remember seeing.  And Disney's plans to make this 3 disc set was the greatest idea so far (along with the Tarzan Collector's Edition).  I've always been keen to the special effects and making of aspecials for movies on TV, and this DVD set has all.  Most notable I'm looking forward to is the reinstatement of ""Claire De Lune,"" a deleted sequence from the original, fully restored (and hopefully with original intro by Deems Taylor, Fantasia's first host).  As well as the storyboards, concept art and more.  Fantasia 2000 I can't wait for because of the additional commentary by Roy Disney, conductor James Levine as well as each segment's supervisor and art director.  My favorite has been the ""Steadfast Tin Soldier,"" followed by ""Firebird Suite.""  Both seem to feel like they could have been conceived in the time of the 1940's, and the classic feel of their animation works well.  ""Carnival of the Animals,"" is the animal segment that replaces the ""Dance of the Hours"" segment from the first Fantasia.  ""Pines of Rome"" has that great feel of having someone let their imagination ""soar"" while daydreaming.  ""Rhapsody in Blue"" has the edge of being the most original because it deals moreso with the art style of master caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, and it's minimalist style leaves room for very spastic motion.  ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" and ""Pomp and Circumstance"" have Mickey and Donald doing things from bringing brooms to magical life and helping Noah get the animals aboard the ark.  ""Symphony No 5"" takes the feel of a ""living painting,"" with the touches of giving a triumphant story of good and evil.  Needless to say, I recommend this to everyone.  I can stil remember seeing it in IMAX on January 3, and the impulse to see it again (saw it 3 times in 2 days, and I was from out of town).",969494400,22,2298,4.728643216080402
1372420,5,B00004Y7S5,"The original 1940 ""Fantasia"" has to be one of the greatest animated films ever and was made with an unbelievable level of creativity  by all participants.  The animation in the film is fantastic, whether it it  is fairly abstract (as in the Bach Toccata and Fugue) or more  representational (as in the ""Rite of Spring"" segment).  My belief  is that visually speaking, the original Fantasia is a stunning film, with a  level of artistry that has never been equalled.  The colors of the early  Disney films were wonderfully rich (I am thinking of Pinocchio).  In  Fantasia, images were drawn in very fine detail and there are  lots of very  fine colors and effects (e.g., reflections from pools of water) here.  The  film was years and years ahead of its time and is way ahead of the  corner-cutting animation that is too common today.  I think Fantasia 2000  is a good film too, but can't quite reach the greatness of the earlier  film.

Although all of the pieces are set to classical music, they are  appealingly presented.  The kids will love most of the segments of the  film, especially the brilliant ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" with  Mickey Mouse that are included in both films. These films are great ways to  get kids interested in music.  The original had Stokowski conducting the  Philadelphia Orchestra at its peak and the sequel has Metropolitan Opera  conductor James Levine leading the Chicago Symphony.

In terms of the music, Disney and  conductor Leopold Stokowski  made a multi-track recording that could only  be played in very few theaters at the time (I think 40 speakers were  needed).  It will be very interesting to see how the original film's  soundtrack is presented on the DVD.  The sound for the sequel was of course  excellent and performances were good too.

  Disney's DVD releases of its  cartoons have been very good in the past.  If any films need to be well  presented on DVD (in terms of sound and picture quality), they must include  Fantasia and its sequal.  It sounds like the DVD is going to have lots of  extra background features for the fans of these films, and I for one am  really looking forward to getting features about the background of the  films, including music pieces that were not included.

  My only  complaint here (common when it comes to some really great older movies) is  why does it take so long to get them to DVD when there surely is an  audience for them?  Let's hope more great films make it to DVD.",967593600,54,2460,4.6879432624113475
1372421,5,B00004Y7S5,"No, it's not there to stock copies of The Eagles or Cream.  It's there for timeless pieces of music with a rich feel.  It's really hard to describe  classical music with anyone word save for emotional.  Composers created the  music to express personal emotion, and to stir that same emotion in the  listener.  Disney decided to supplant that emotion, in a good way, with  imagery.  Disney's early experiment with animation and music resulted in  Fantasia.  Originally concieved as a constant work in progress, the film  was to be a film/concert piece that would be continously updated every so  often with a few new pieces replacing some of the elder pieces.  Kind of  like a rotating schedule, some pieces would stay others would leave.  Well,  the film opened to little fanfare and Disney move onto bigger and better  soon after.  Some 55+ years later, Roy Disney resurrects the Fantasia  concept to be updated with new segments.  The two films, hopefully to be  the first two in a more frequently visited series, blend incredible pieces  of classical music with varying cartoon images.  Some pieces carry entire  stories with them and others serve merely as background music for freaky  shapes and objects.  There are memorable piece in both films, most notably,  The Sorcerer's Apprentice, starring Mickey in his tour de force, The  Nutcracker Suite as told in nature's settings, and in the new version,  Rhapsody in Blue circa 1930's NYC, and a retelling of Noah's Ark (starring  Donald and Daisy Duck!) with Pomp and Circumstance (The Graduation  Song...). Finally, after nearly ten years of it's supposed final release  ever (on any format....) on VHS and LD, Disney gets the idea in their head  that Fantasia is a good film to release on DVD, and it goes even better  with Fantasia 2000 with bonus supplements.  Enter the 3 disc set which  looks to be quite promising.... The good thing about the two films which  make them as good as they are is that there's no need for the film at all  to pander to a child's point of view, and the film never has to beef itself  up with smarmy (read: for parents sitting through the film) inside or  ""grownup"" jokes.  It's all visual, and the stories, where one  exists, are universal and simple.  It's one downside is that neither film  is easily approachable by all.  Despite the simple stories and great music,  some just do not have the patience for classical music, or a film with no  dialog. Bear this in mind as for all but the most patient children will get  ansty or bored with this at times.  They can only watch so many volcanoes  blow or whales fly before they have to give up and flip in a Pokemon DVD or  Tarzan.  But for those who appreciate animation of all kinds as completely  as I do, this is an essential set of films that cannot be missed.",967161600,20,2805,4.662551440329218
1372422,5,B00004Y7S5,"Everywhere you look, you can see the comment ""This is not your classical Disney production"", and they are all right. Fantasia (and  his fellow, fantasia 2000) are movies that don't search for money but to  give us the reason that explain why cinema is named ""the 7th  art"". This movie is a piece of art.

I like the content of the Fantasia Legacy DVD is wonderful (I particularly enjoyed the short for Clair de Lune, which had not been included in the original Fantasia) but organization of the content is a little putzy and the menu etc for the visual development/character development portions is especially fussy to navigate, as one cannot just go to the next image like a slideshow but go back to the thumbnails of the images in that menu.  However the artwork within said menus is quite good (I wouldn't mind prints of a couple of those!) and it's nice to see the ideas and skills the various artists had/have at the Disney Animation Studio.",1411603200,,722,4.768

1372493,5,B00004Y7S5,"Fantasia holds its own as #58 on the AFI top 100 lists against many classics such as The Godfather and Citizen Kane. What elevates this cartoon to such levels?

First, its key feature is fantastic, classical music. Playing this DVD is like sitting down to a wonderful concert. You could simply play it through without visuals and enjoy it.

Of course, Disney is famous for its images, and Fantasia is no exception! They bring each song to life in its own unique way. Some tell a specific story, like the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Others are more impressionistic. There are twirling hippos and dancing mushrooms. Centaurs and dinosaurs.

This DVD has a minor tweak to the storyline - a short clip of an 'African-American lower-class centaur' was trimmed out. While some might find that to be extreme, I'm content with that change. What remains are centaurs of all colors, representing all of us. There was no reason to single one out as being the ""servant"" one with stereotypical traits.

If I have one issue, it's the scene with the ""teenage girl centaurs"". They start the scene with the girls neck-deep in a pond, clearly leading the viewer to believe they are humans. It's supposed to be a ""surprise"" when they emerge from the water and reveal themselves to be half horse. So as these girls are slowly emerging from the water, they're all naked down to the waist. I feel uncomfortable with half naked teen girls on the screen. Yes eventually watchers realize they are centaurs - once we get past the waist. Still, the whole scene is given an ""ogling something that should be private"" atmosphere and the idea of ogling naked bathing teen girls doesn't appeal to me.

Still, with that one caveat, the scenes are great.

Well recommended; a true classic.",1324684800,,1750,4.7781456953642385
1372494,5,B00004Y7S5,"As an artist, I've always loved this movie. As a kid, I found this movie to be kind of long, but I had always been captivated by the images and music when I could ever muster up the sitting the power.  Of course getting older gives you a little more patience for these types of things though, and I'm so glad because the features on this are amazing.  The are hours of extra footage, interviews, and future sequencing they were thinking of adding in later.  I have gotten to the special features dvd itsefl, but I can only imagine the type of information they have on that sine the dvds of the films themselves are chalk full of things.  I love Fantasia.

Walt Disney had a series of television releases called ""Tricks Of Our Trade"" that gave thirty minute detailed break downs of Disney's art traditions that set the standard for animation studios around the world. These videos have become very difficult to track down and all of these short documentaries are on the third disc of this set!

I can now share these DVDs with my grandchildren, to show them the different artists both visual and auditory. I grew up watching the original Fantasia.

1372498,4,B00004Y7S5,"After several years of trying to locate Fantasia on DVD locally, I turned to Amazon to obtain both films. Needless to say, I am knocked out by the DVD versions and on my new Sony HD set with a Blu-Ray player spinning the discs, I am not disappointed. In fact, I want to view the films in total black some night so I can truly have the experience. Mr Stokowski knew exactly how to handle the music and disney knew how the animation should go. That is why Fantasia has always ranked high on my list of must haves. Fantasia 2000 with Levine wasn't too bad either. I think that having Roy Disney on as animator helped that film. As an example of great animation, these two films are fantastic. the third disc in the set which has all the extra stuff is also good. I just never though there was that much left over from a project of this magnitude.  all I can say: If you haven't seen Fantasia on DVD, get hold of this set as you will soon see what I saw upon initial viewing: A fantastic piece of film that is worthy of a place in the film collection.",1267920000,,1047,4.157635467980295
1372499,5,B00004Y7S5,"I finally have both Fantasia movies on DVD. Had one on VHS but it was starting to show wear from playing for the grandkids.

1372500,4,B00004Y7S5,"The other reviewers are right.  The silly (and at this point futile) cropping of the ""offensive"" scene in ""pastoral"" is sill there, and Deems Taylor may as well be nonexistent without that sonorous voice (which you may recall if you watched the VHS of this film, or saw one of it's rereleases).

That being said, the audio and video remastering is quite good- though if Disney thought there was any money in it, they could do better.  And the extras are actually interesting- unlike most of the tripe they package into Disney special editions.  The ""extended"" (or roadshow cut) is also very intersting, but since I grew up with the shorter-running-time VHS version, this one seems a little on the long side.  But I'm not going to complain about more of this spectacular film.
At it's heart this is a triumph of film and particularly of animation.  It is a valuable addition to any collection.",1201392000,,892,4.72258064516129
1372501,4,B00004Y7S5,"I am a big fan of Disney films. The animated classics will be forever imprinted in my mind. I do have a huge problem with any censorship! Unfortunately, the people at Disney decided to buckle under to it, because of a few cry babies complaining about racial stereotypes in some of their films. I know I am not the first to say this,but really are these people serious? I am Italian and German, do you think I have not seen my share of stereotyping in my 45 years on this planet? Why hasn't Stromboli from Pinochhio been altered for it's depiction of an Italian? It seems we are very selective with what we censor..hhmmm! I don't mind it because I know the characterization is just that and it doesn't reflect the entire race! Please stop censorship of any kind especially regarding these historic works of art. You can not change history you can only learn from it!",1173225600,14,865,4.515923566878981

It's sad that this is the world we live in now. So sensitive that we are ruining works of art? Companies are scared to death to offend anyone now. So, sadly, we may never see this original film in its uncut state (although the box says 'Original Uncut Version', which is a big load of hogwash). We may never see films like ""Song of the South"" released on dvd, which is a shame because it's a great movie.

I just don't get it. Hiding (or disguising or censoring) a part of history doesn't make it go away.",1165017600,10,632,4.302521008403361

Walt's original dream for ""Fantasia"" was to keep releasing it with new segments replacing older ones. ""Fantasia 2000"" was an attempt to continue that dream, and it worked. The picture and sound on both films is perfect. I would buy this boxed set instead of the single releases of the two films, because the special features on each film are very lacking, but this boxed set includes the extra ""Fantasia Legacy"" disc, which includes deleted scenes and deleted concept art. If you are a ""Fantasia"" fan, I highley recomend getting ""Make Mine Music,"" a lesser known Disney movie which includes a deleted scene from ""Fantasia"" set to different music.",1074729600,,812,4.725352112676056
1372504,5,B00004Y7S5,"In 1940, Walt Disney released his most ambitious art-house project: Fantasia. With World War II barely beginning to rage in Europe, Disney sought to entertain as well as educate audiences. Never before had audiences seen such a miracle. Fantasia combined aesthetic animation with classical music. Disneu had already released ""Snow White"" in the 30's to people who had never seen animation on the big screen before. Generations would be enchanted by Fantasia for decades. It spawned a second installment in 2000. This DVD gives us both the 1940 Fantasia, restored with greater sound and color and Fantasia 2000. The first Fantasia features behind-the-scenes look on its making. We see how a brainy Disney gathered the best and most talented animators to create fantastical imagery. He was fortunate enough to employ the great conductor Leopold Stokowski, who arranged Bach's ""Toccata And Fugue In D Minor"" from organ work to full orchestra. Stokowski was one of the greats, right along such legends as Toscanini and Karajan. Look also for Mickey Mouse attempting to imitate Stokowski's conducting. The bonus features for Fantasia 2000 gives us never-before-seen segments that never made it to the final version. They include animated sequences set to Debussy's ""Claire De Lune"" and Richard Wagner's ""Ride Of The Valkyries"". They should have at least shown us Ride Of The Valkyries in the final version!!!This DVD is a must have for hardcore fans of Disney and of Fantasia. It is the perfect introduction to classical music. It's how I got hooked into classical music in the first place. I watched Fantasia of 1940 when I was seven and the memories of the music and the imagery remained a lifetime.
1940's Fantasia begins with Bach's Toccata And Fugue. Originally an organ work, it's orchestral arrangement is far more dramatic to listen to, with its dark D minor chords. It's the famous theme most people associate with Dracula. The sequence is nothing more than a chaotic swirl of indistinct figures and abstractions like an early 20th century abstract painting floating in the air. The second feature is Tchaikovsky's Waltz Of The Flowers from his ballet The Nutcracker. It's breathtakingly beautiful to behold -the nocturnal fairies playing with flowers in an orgy of color. Impressive is how the waltz closes with the ice-skating fairies and falling snowflakes. The French composer Dukas' ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" tells the story of a mischievous apprentice who gets himself into trouble when he casts a spell that goes wrong. Mickey Mouse plays the apprentice. Fondly remembered are the living brooms that Mickey had hoped would obediently do his chores for him. Perhaps the most controversial sequence is Stravinski's ""Rite Of Spring"" sequence, taken from the jazz ballet which at its premiere caused a riot. Stravinski's harsh, dramatic and violent-sounding music was not well-received at first but is now thought to be extremely innovative. Disney perhaps meant to shock and to tread new frontier with animating a sequence depicting the Evolution Theory. The primitive earth, nothing more than lava and pangea terrain, becomes the fertile breeding ground of the dinosaurs. Violent raptors and vicious tyrannasaurus rex rule supreme. We also get the theory of how they were wiped out possibly though changes in climate.
The most famous moment is the Dance Of The Hours. Who doesn't remember the fat hippo ladies in ballet tutus being chased by the lusty red-cloaked alligators ? The Pastoral Symphony by Beethoven is beautifully presented against a backdrop of mythological and bucolic Greece. It's gorgeous to look at the variety of creatures, both earth-bound and heavenly- Pegasus and his family of winged horses, the seductive nymphs, centaurs and centaurettes, satyrs, Bacchus the drunken wine-god and his entourage as well as the imperious Zeus who hurls thunderbolt from the clouds during the storm portion. The closing scene is the moon goddess Diana with her hunting bow as she shoots the night skies with stars. The scariest moment is of course Night On Bald Mountain. The towering Devil and his ghouls and goblins dance during the night and are driven away at the first light of dawn. I remember being horrified by the Devil in that sequence. But at least it got me into Mussorgky's Night On Bald Mountain. The music is incredible.
Fantasia 2000 begins with Beethoven's first movement from his 5th Symphony. The famous music is not hard to forget, the four powerful notes Pa-pa-ra-ra! is supposed to represent Fate knocking at someone's door according to Beethoven. This sequence, like the 1940 Fantasia opening sequence, is abstract triangles and circles imitating butterflies and bats in a shapeless background. Respighi's Pines Of Rome follows the life of whales swimming at night, Rhapsody In Blue portrays New York City in a very jazzy and comic style, the Carnival Of The Animals is hilarious and the concluding Firebird Suite is by far the most beautiful depiction of nature as holy as anything.",1074556800,7,5022,5.170761670761671

1372506,5,B00004Y7S5,"The two-fold achievement of the 1940 film Fantasia -- breaking new ground in the art of film-making while evoking the essence of another art form (music) -- was profound and unparalleled.  This groundbreaking Disney feature comprises of eight individual animation sequences, each with an abstract or concrete theme and accompanied with a well-known piece of music -- with the music often seemingly having little in common with the animation.  The Nutcracker Suite, for instance, is paired with images of the passing of the four seasons, and Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony is used for depicting mythological creatures.  The result may upset music purists, but it shows vividly and effectively how pictures and music can enhance one another -- how pictures can offer interpretation (or re-interpretation) of a piece of music, and how existing music can be used to enhance a film with a totally different context (such as in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Brief Encounter, and the many films that make use of Wagner's Rides of the Valkries).
Fantasia 2000, the ""sequel"" made in 1999, only manages one animation segment that is close to achieving the lofty goal set by the original film.  In the ""Rhapsody in Blue"" segment, the Al Hirshfield-style animation is a perfect fit for the jazzy Gershwin's tune, with one capturing the spirit of the other almost note for note, frame by frame.  The rest of the segments are pretty unexceptional, with the exquisitely drawn ""Firebird Suite"" segment perhaps the best, and the nonsensical interpretation of Beethoven's 5th Symphony perhaps the worst.
The 3-disc DVD collection THE FANTASIA ANTHOLOGY includes Fantasia and Fantasia 2000, as well as an enormous amount of extra material that reveals the history, craftsmanship, and artistic achievements of the two films (and also of Disney animation itself).
The first disc, the Fantasia DVD, contains what Disney claims to be the uncut, original theatrical version of the 125-minute film, but it isn't exactly so.  Although the introductions that begin each segment have been restored in full on this disc (5 minutes of Deems Taylor's introductions have been restored since the 1990 re-release version), their soundtracks couldn't be fully recovered.  So Taylor's voice has been re-dubbed entirely with someone else's.  Also, some footage was cut from the Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony segment in the 1960s due to its stereotypical depiction of African Americans.  It remains cut on this disc.  Hence, this is ""almost"" the uncut, original 1940 version.  The disc contains both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.0 audio. The restored Taylor introductions describe each segment more fully, both in terms of the underlying story of the animation and the significance of the music.  Extras on the Fantasia disc include a 30-minute featurette ""The Making of Fantasia"" that recounts production history and provides technical and artistic insights on all 8 animation segments, and an audio track of Walt Disney's comments on the film, either straight from his mouth from old recordings, or read by others.
On the Fantasia 2000 disc, all the music is extraordinarily recorded with Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 sound.  The 74-minute movie was originally shown in IMAX theaters, so the picture quality (depending on the monitor you see it on) is startling clear and sharp.  The disc also includes 2 cartoon shorts from the 50s that teach kids the basic principals of music.
It is the third disc, titled ""The Fantasia Legacy"", that should please animation fans.  Its main attraction is the hundreds of still-frame concept arts, storyboards, cel drawings for all 15 segments in the 2 movies.  All the images were scanned at a very high quality, and many of them almost full screen.  The images are well-organized into sections: ""Visual Development"", ""Character Designs"", ""Abandoned Concepts"", etc.  None of the images is captioned, but their artistry and purpose pretty much speak for themselves.  Other noteworthy material on the disc include: a film clip demonstrating that music from one segment could easily be made to fit another segment (hence, the subjectiveness of music), a tongue-in-cheek segment showing artists studying a ballerina's movements while sketching elephants and hippos on their drawing pads, a still-frame comparison of Al Hirschfeld's original cartoons and the animation used in the ""Rhapsody in Blue"" segment, a fully-animated but never used segment from Fantasia titled ""Clare de Lune"", a chronology of theatrical showings of Fantasia from 1940 to 2000 that also notes how the film was altered for each release.  The original ""Roadshow Program"" for Fantasia is also reproduced in the still-frame section, but unfortunately the words are too tiny to be legible.  Also present are the usual supplements such as trailers, TV commercials, posters, filmmakers' bios.",1061856000,8,4840,5.29242819843342
1372507,5,B00004Y7S5,"I think Walt Disney would be happy in knowing what a hot seller the original Fantasia was and be proud of his nephew Roy with Fantasia 2000.  The Fantasia Anthology does include the original Fantasia with previously deleted scenes from Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony reinstated (at least my copy does).  In addition, some of Deems Taylor's dialogue had been edited out on the 1991 re-release.  Ironically, the title card was originally not at the beginning of the movie but right after the intermission ( just before the orchestra breaks out into an impromptu ""jam"" and Deems introduces the soundtrack).
As for both movies, I'm more familiar with the original and my main regret about Fantasia 2000 was not seeing it in the theatre.
The 1st includes Bach's Toccota and Fugue (the animation is impressionistic and leaves much to the viewer's imagination).
Selections from Tchakowski's Nutcracker Suite follow this (cleverly done with seasonal fairies, mushrooms, fish and flowers dancing).
To follow is my favourite segment, Dukas' The Sorcerer's Apprentice (if you haven't seen it, Mickey Mouse tries his hand at magic while his master's back is turned and is more successful at performing the magic than he is controlling it!).  Immediately after the segment, Mickey shakes conductor Leopold Stokowsky's hand!
Stravinksy's Rite of Spring follows this with the beginning of time animated to the impressionistic piece.
Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony follows with unicorns, cupids and centaurs.
Then we move onto Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours.  This is one of the funniest sequences here, with hippos, ostriches and alligators dancing around (I think it inspired Allan Sherman's novelty record ""Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah"" and a scene in Animaniacs where one of the Warner Bros belches out the melody!).  Probably not what Ponchielli originally had in mind, oh well!
The animation used for Moussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain is very stylistic and quite frightening (I probably wouldn't show it to kids too young!).  Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera were probably quite inspired by it.  Immediately following is Schubert's Ave Maria.  After seeing what was meant to go in, the animation here was a bit of a letdown.
Fantasia 2000 builds on Walt's plans 60 years later (technology has changed in the course of time but Roy has assembled a worthy ""sequel"").  This time, there are several narrators including Steve Martin, Penn and Teller, Quincy Jones, James Earl Jones, Bette Middler Angela Lansbury and conductor Jim Levine.
The animation for Beethoven's 5th Symphony is very abstract.  Ottorno's Pines of Rome is an impressionistic piece with  surrealistic animation of whales dancing in the heavens.
Gerschwin's Rhapsody in Blue is my favourite piece on F-2000(musically and visually) with cartoon-strip style animation inspired by the late Al Hirshfeld.
An interpretation of The Steadfast Tin Soldier accompanies Shostakovich's Piano Concerto 2.  This had been in the planning since 1938.
There's a brief sequence of Saint-Saens' Carnival of the Animals with a carefree flamingo annoying his friends with his yo-yo!
Afterwards, the original Sorcerer's Apprentice follows and then Mickey gets Donald Duck ready for the next movement.  Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance (aka The Graduation Song) includes an animated reading of Noah's Ark featuring Donald and Daisy Duck (Donald is depressed when he is temporarily separated from his beloved Daisy).
Stravinky's Firebird Suite helps translate an environmental tale as the wrath of the firebird erupts from a volcano and a surviving elk and Sprite try to re-vitalise a damaged forest.
Give yourself a week to enjoy the extras here, which include full-length commentaries on both films, interviews with Roy Disney and some of the crew, alternate ideas which never made either films (sketches and animated sequences for other musical pieces that didn't make it), 2 classic Disney cartoons and stock footage of Walt Disney explaining his secrets for Fantasia.  If it weren't for Fantasia, cartoons featuring classical music probably wouldn't exist.",1044748800,6,4084,5.369327073552426
1372508,5,B00004Y7S5,"This is the set for showing off your home theatre, and for enjoying one of the best films of all time (Fantasia -1940) and its worthy successor Fantasia 2000.  There are not hours, but DAYS of ancillary materials, interviews, commentary, old reminiscences and inside stories here. This set could be the basis for a film-school course on animation or on Disney.  Classy all the way, the visuals are flawless and the loving reconstruction and remastering of the original Fantasia shows the dedication of these talented artists and technicians. The sound quality is also a treat, from the THX swoosh to the rich orchestrations in the film.",1040947200,,636,4.990566037735849
1372509,4,B00004Y7S5,"Walt Disney's 1942 FANTASIA was a groundbreaking film and remains a landmark to this day, a brilliant series of animated sequences set to notable concert music conducted by Leopold Stokowski of The Philadelphia Orchestra.  The three disk FANTASIA ANTHOLOGY, however, is extremely overrated.

The first disk is the original FANTASIA, which Disney describes as restored.  This is not strictly true.  First and foremost, the restoration of visual elements is sloppy at best, with the film plagued by streaks and blips, and at least one sequence (""Dance of the Hours"") appears to be slightly cropped.  That aside, portions of the Deems Taylor narration have been completely lost, and these have been rerecorded by Tim Matheson--and Matheson's voice is not a good match for Taylor and the sychronization is poorly done.  Lastly, one selection (""Pastoral"") has been censored: a brief image, which would be considered racist by today's standards, has been deleted from the sequence.

Even so, it is still FANTASIA, and it overcomes all of these liabilities.  The animation, which was created by hand and photographed through a number of laborious processes, shows Disney Studios at the height of its powers.  Every one is certain to have their favorites among the selections (mine are ""Dance of the Hours"" and ""Night on Bald Mountain""), but every selection is brilliantly conceived and executed, and although the content varies from sequence to sequence the overall style of the film hangs together in a most remarkable way.  FANTASIA was, is, and will no doubt will forever remain a touchstone in animation art.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the second disk, FANTASIA 2000.  This particular film is extremely uneven, the sequences lack the same cohesive style that held the original FANTASIA together, and the entire film is beset by a series of often obnoxious ""celebrity"" introductions that give the film the feel of a made-for-TV variety show.  Still, some of the visual ideas are very impressive, and while they are too few to offset the portions of the film that do not work, they still make FANTASIA 2000 mildly entertaining.

Both the FANTASIA and FANTASIA 2000 disks include documentaries and commentary tracks on each film.  The third disk, called ""The Fantasia Legacy,"" is a bonus packed with interviews, archieval footage, and sketches that show how each sequence in both films was developed and then filmed.  Some of this material is redundant, for it is included on the documentaries on the first two disks, but most of it is unique to this disk alone.  Disney originally saw FANTASIA as a film that could be re-released with a mix of old and new selections every few years, and the most interesting material on the ""Legacy"" disk is a restored ""Clair de Lune"" (made for and then cut from the original FANTASIA) and various storyboard ideas for future sequences.

The only way one can obtain the ""Legacy"" disk is to purchase this three disk package--and therein lies the rub.  The original FANTASIA is brilliant, and even in its so-so state it is worthy of a place in any DVD library.  FANTASIA 2000, however, is trivial, occasionally interesting but not greatly memorable and not a piece that one would normally go out of the way to purchase.  And the price for the three disk package is quite steep.

If you are a Disney fan who must have every scrap of material available, I would recommend the investment this package requires.  But if your primary interest is the original FANTASIA, you are much better off simply purchasing a DVD of that film alone--the other two disks are simply not worth the expense.  Purchasers should also remember that the original FANTASIA does not often appeal to very young children, and if the purchase is being made for a child you are likely to be disappointed in their response.  Final thought: the original FANTASIA is brilliant, FANTASIA 2000 is so-so, and the bonus disk is for hardcore fans.  This pricey package is recommended to the latter only.

1372510,5,B00004Y7S5,"I already owned the original ""Fantasia"" (on VHS), and bought ""Fantasia 2000"" when I bought my DVD player. I wanted to buy the ""Legacy"" DVD when I was down in Orlando, but the Disney people told me that the only way I could get it was to buy the Anthology boxed set. So I bought it, and I'm glad I did.
I'd forgotten how wonderful the original ""Fantasia"" is. I worked as an usher at my local movie theatre when I was in high school (in the 70's). For several summers back then, Disney ran their own little festival of their greatest animated films, and the kids flocked in to see them. Sadly, one summer they showed ""Fantasia"" as part of the festival. I say ""sadly"" because ""Fantasia"" is NOT in the same vein as ""Snow White"", ""Cinderella"", or even ""The Jungle Book"". Although it is an animated film I see it as too sophisticated for young children (with the single exception of the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" segment with Mickey Mouse) - and my point was proved when at least two thirds of the audience fell asleep during the film. But for older kids (ages 14 and up) it is a marvelous introduction to classical music - they can listen to several pieces of music and watch one man's interpretation of that music. And adults can both appreciate the music, and relive their childhood for a time by watching the animation.
""Fantasia 2000"" will never really have the same emotional impact as its predecessor, but to compare these two films is really to compare apples and oranges. The animation in this film is completely different than the animation in the original. It's not a question of evolution, although the process has indeed evolved. The original ""Fantasia"" showed what could be done with the animation available at the time; so too does ""Fantasia 2000"" show what can be done with animation as it now is. Each in their own way, these films are the ultimate achievement of their time, and will serve as guideposts for animators for years to come. The major difference here is that ""Fantasia 2000"" was never marketed as a children's movie, even though Disney included the ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" sequence in it.
But the major reason to buy this set is the third disc - ""The Fantasia Legacy"". There are so many extras in here that it would take far too long to describe them all. I'll just focus on one set - the pieces that Walt Disney had to drop from the film because they made it too long.
There is only one complete sequence - ""Clair de Lune"". The music and animation are just as spectacular as those that made into what is now considered the final cut. The others contained on this disc are only storyboards, but the music is included on a sequential showing of each of them. What a pity that World War II forced Walt to abandon his dream of replacing some of the existing sequences from time to time with some of those shown here - if the artwork is any indication at all, ""Fantasia"" could have been something REALLY special.",1029542400,2,2930,4.5406427221172025
1372511,4,B00004Y7S5,"Musicians who love music are all over classical music. No other style can be more expressive, and more effective in causing the mind to create its own ""images"", if you will, than classical. Classical music is also the most under apreciated music out there. There isn't enough focus on it, and the vast majority of music sales fall under the rock catagorey. But classical, and neo classical remain my favorite genre. As such, the two Fantasia films are amoung my favorite DVD collection on a shelf for all to see, rather than in a DVD storage box like the majority of my collection. I will confess that I never got around to watching the third disk of this collection, but I really enjoyed the movies despite the agrivating cuts made to the original to make it more ""politically correct"" (I don't know why people get so upset about such trivial things, but oh well.) My only concern is the condition of the original. Neither the sound or the video was as good as it could have been. Perhaps it is because the original footage is so old, but it does make one wonder why Disney didn't take the oportunity to try and restore the film during the nineties. Mr. Lucas did it with Star Wars, and granted Fantasia is much older than Star Wars, but the film preservation could have been better. They could have restored it earlier, thus saving more of the visual flare that I believe this film has lost due to the age of the footage. Because they did not do this the film looks pretty bad. But the movie is more so about the music anyway, which thankfully was restored earlier in the films ""life"". While Fantasia may be boring for some, for music lovers it is a must have, and the DVD format will give you the best possible presentation of these two spectacular films.",1022630400,,1758,4.496875
1372512,5,B00004Y7S5,"The value of this anthology lies in thebonus material disk, which includes a wealth of background information, artwork, and reconstructed scenes and storeyboards for ""The Fantasia That Never Was.""  The true jewel is the reconstituted ""Clair de Lune"" sequence, finished but cut from the original Fantasia in 1940.  You may have seen portions of the animation, re-edited and rescored, as ""Blue Bayou"" in ""Make Mine Music.""  If so, I'm sure you'll agree that the animation is much better used in its original context.
The Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 disks are wonderful too, but not nearly as epiphanic as the bonus disk, with its inclusion of ""Clair de Lune.""  One tragedy of the Fantasia 60th anniversary DVD is the failure to include the original Deems Taylor voiceovers in the interstitials.  Apparently, the disc producers had within their control ALL original interstitial material (some of which had been cut from previous editions), but could not locate ALL of the audio for the previiously cut portions.  As a result, they were left with a choice to either present a full and complete version of the original with a new or partially-new voiceover, or present another edited version completely voiced by the original narrator, Deems Taylor.  They went with the decision to include all of the scenes with a new voiceover.  Their voice choice was Corey Burton - an excellent choice, yet, sadly, no substitute for Taylor.
Rediscovering Fantasia has, for me, refreshed the notion of Walt Disney as an artist and friend of the intellectual.  It's tremendously easy, in this tepid Eisnerian era, to dismiss 'Disney' as a commercialistic, pap-spewing corporate evil.  But in Walt Disney's lifetime, that wasn't necessarily the case.  Fantasia made Mr. Disney the darling of the intelligentsia!
So.  Don't throw away your old Fantasia videos, but DO add this wonderful anthology to your collection.  It offers some fresh material, encouraging you to make fresh insights regarding the film, the men who created it, and the time in which it was made.  Plus, it offers the added fun of the visually-breathtaking Fantasia 2000, the darling of the IMAX screen.",1021593600,3,2151,5.126074498567335
1372513,5,B00004Y7S5,"You MUST own this set if you are a lover of Fantasia, Disney or animation in general. I have never seen a more complete DVD, or one that so embraces the format as this. There are extras spilling out all over the place. I watched this for 5 hours straight, and didn't even scratch the surface of what surprises were included. It may be months before I even get to the films themselves!
The boxed set includes both Fantasia films & a DVD of just extras. Each of the DVDs for the individual films not only include extras themselves, but 2 commentary tracks each. On Fantasia the commentary is by Disney himself, taken from audio interviews and reading of transcripts from story meetings. It's incredible! The extras disc breaks down all of the individual parts of the films with discussion, unused animation, story boards or whatever else may have been available for that particular film.

1372514,5,B00004Y7S5,"Review 1 of 7 set reviews:  ""The Fantasia Anthology"" was released in 2000.  This set is probally the one with the greatest legnth for one of the greatest motion pictures of all time.  When you order or buy this set, it comes with three discs in a cardboard box and a letter from Roy Disney.  The clef on the cover changes it's color at angles.  The letter includes a list of all the features on the third disc.  The set's three discs are the original ""Fantasia"", ""Fantasia 2000"", and the ""Fantasia Legacy.""  The original ""Fantasia"" has great things.  Including the 1940 ""Roadshow"" version of the film.  Over the years, it has been cut.  This is the original 125 minute ""Fantasia.""  Complete with intermission and narration.  There are two audio commentaries.  One with Roy Disney, James Levine, John Canemaker, and Scott MacQueen.  The second one is an audio commentary with Walt Disney!  It is gathered from interviews spanning three decades.  They are all hosted by John Canemaker.  The final feature is ""The Making of Fantasia"" featurette.  It is a great way to see the making of the film.  The technical features are two captions, english and french.  There is DTS 5.1 digital sound and Dolby Digital 5.1 digital surround sound.  Final thing is the THX Optimode.  The second disc is ""Fantasia 2000,"" the long awaited sequel to ""Fantasia.""  Walt wanted ""Fantasia"" to be a work in progress, with new segments replacing existing segments over years of continual release.  His idea never happend for 60 years until ""Fantasia 2000"" was released.  This movie contains ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" and seven new segments.  The hosts are celebrities.  There are also two audio commentaries.  The first one contains Roy Disney, James Levine, and Don Ernst.  The second one features the segment directors, art directors, Roy Disney, Mickey Mouse, and Donald Duck.  There are two musical shorts: ""Melody"" and the Academy Award winnning short ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom.""  There is a showcase program featuring highlights from the feature, a Roy Disney introduction, a ""Fantasia 2000"" booklet, a french language track in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, and finally ""The Making of Fantasia 2000"" featurette.  There are also these technical features: THX Optimode, Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 sound, captions for english and french, and DTS Digital 5.1 sound.  The final disc is the ""Fantasia Legacy Supplemental Disc.""  It is the crown jewel of the set.  It is the detailed making of both of the movies.  There is an introduction.  Then you go to Fantasia.  The eight segments feature introductions, deleted scenes, ""Disneyland T.V."" excerpts, and about the music.  In the more features, there is the ""Fantasia That Never Was.""  Featuring an introduction and the following suggested pieces for the future ""Fantasias:"" ""Clair De Lune.""  This has a visual developement gallery.  This piece was scheduled to open the original ""Fantasia"" but was cut out because of ""Fantasia's"" excessive legnth.  There were previous attempts to restore this but were disabled.  In 1993, they found the complete thing.  This piece was used in the late 1940s in ""Make Mine Music.""  ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" was a piece that only got to the story reel.  At the time it was being considered because the war didn't have America in it but it was raging in Europe.  So they thought it would be too dramatic a piece to be inserted into any future ""Fantasia.""  ""The Swan of Tuonela"" was cut because it never came to frution.  It is a lovely, moody, slow piece.  Another piece is ""The Invitation To The Dance.""  Walt put Peter Pegasus from the ""Pastoral Symphony"" in the original ""Fantasia.""  The final piece is ""Adventures in a Perambulator.""  This piece is in an elaborate story reel made in the 1940s.  There is art for other concepts.  These are for ""The Flight of The Bumblebee,"" ""Baby Ballet,"" and ""Mosquito.""  Also at the more section, there is ""The Special Effects of Fantasia"" featurette, a publicity section, and the biographies.  Then there is the Fantasia 2000 section featuring the making of every segment, there is deleted segments, alternate concepts, about the music, production progression demonstrations, galleries, story reels, storyboard to film comarisons, and other featurettes.  At the more section, you mix your own music for Betthoven's Symphony #5, the biographies, and the trailors.
What a set this is.  This movie is better than a lot of the new stuff that they make today.  There is another ""Fantasia"" coming out soon.  So we want this to be a set to cherish for generations.  Order now from any store DVDs are sold.

1372515,5,B00004Y7S5,"This is really a great DVD for Disney lovers. And for music lovers too.
The video quality of these discs is very nice: Fantasia has been remastered quite well and, even if dated, it appears detailed, with relatively low noise and some grain.
Fantasia 2000 is of course very very good, but not ""perfect"". Maybe due to the higher difficulties for MPEG to encode drawings and pictures with sharp edges, you will notice some pixelization and blocking effects. Nevertheless, this is absolutely not distracting and the overall impression is good. Video is only ""nearly"" perfect but... you will be captured by the sound. Fantasia is great, even if the sound is dated and surround effects are a bit too exagerated by early-experimentation.
Fantasia 2000 is terrific. Pines of Rome is a very good example of high quality multichannel recording. And the DTS track delivers great basses, subtle details and much higher level compared to the DD version, giving more punch and improving resolution and S/N ratio.
Regarding the extras... you have to have it: you can find extras all around the three discs, and not only in the third one. You'll learn everything about Fantasia, and also about how Fantasia has never been...",1000080000,,1209,4.960591133004926

The 2nd edition (""Fantasia 2000"") lives up to the quality of its predecessor.  We get whales prancing about to Resphigi's ""Pines Of Rome"" as well as a literal nature-themed interpretation of Stravinsky's ""Firebird"" suite.  Both DVDs have the classic ""Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" starring Mickey Mouse.  Arguably, this is the most infamous and recognizable animated feature in Disney history.

I thought to myself, ""Wouldn't it be great if Disney released Fantasia on DVD along with Fantasia 2000?""  Well, I did some research on the web and found out that Disney had read my mind.  The greatest part about the Anthology is all of the extras.  There two tracks of commentaries for both feature films, and interviews with disney animators, Documentaries, alternate endings for the segments, the list goes on and on.  My favorite is the complete segment of ""Clair de Lune""  a segment that was never released with the original Fantasia, but I believe it should have been.  The Fantasia Anthology demonstrates what Disney can do if they are willing to be serious about their work.  The animation is as mature as the music is.  This is animation that adults can enjoy possibly even more than children.  I remember how frightened I was the first time I saw Night on Bald Mountain.  The emotions you will recieve from these movies are more intense and thouht- provoking than most feature- length animated films you see today, no matter who the distributor is.  As you can tell, I highly reccomend paying the extra dough for the whole set, even if this means that you have to wait untill you have saved enough, the DVD's are deffinately worth the wait.",983664000,9,1425,4.648

Fantasia 2000, while not living up to it's predecessor, still has some shining moments, including the marvelous ""Pines of Rome"", and the unsurpassed ""Firebird"".  The anime-like ""Firebird"" is well worth the price of admission all by itself!  Some of the new numbers are a little weak, but overall, the effect is worth watching.  My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer.  74 minutes is not enough time to explore everthing that could have been done with the marriage of classical music to animation with today's techniques.
The companion disc, ""The Fantasia Legacy"", contains many interesting things for fans of both movies.  It also includes some cutting room floor scenes, and whole sections that were deleted from both editions, including alternate endings!  ""The Fantasia That Never Was"" is really worth watching if you love the original.  Two hours and forty one minutes of additional material!

1372523,4,B00004Y7S5,"The original ""Fantasia"" is a masterpiece that was truly ahead of its time.  I bought the VHS boxed set back in '91 and I'm glad I did.  Although this collection is comprehensive, it's not complete.  First off, the inclusion of ALL of the original narration was a good idea but NOT without the voice of Deems Taylor.  The ""Fantasia"" DVD states that the original narration was unsalvageable, which is too bad.  I miss Taylor's more masculine sounding voice and the dubbing is obvious in a few places.  Also, some of the audio for ""Toot, Whistle..."" is missing.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Also, the ""Making of"" from the VHS boxed set in NOT included in this DVD package.  Some of the interviews were incorporated, though.
  Now for the pluses.  I LOVE the restored ""Claire de lune"" despite the fact that there's no introduction by Deems Taylor and some footage of Stokowski conducting the end of the toccata section from Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"" is used to begin the piece.  It's like finding a new segment from the original ""Fantasia"".  I also admire the storyboards for ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" and ""The Swan of Tuonela"".  One can only hope that they will someday be animated in the style of Kai Nielsen.
  It's almost perfect.  I doubt we'll ever see the politically incorrect version of the ""Pastorale"" but surely they could do something to restore the original narration using Deems Taylor's voice.  After all, it's Taylor who introduces Beethoven's Fifth in ""Fantasia 2000"".",979862400,5,1502,4.796875

My 8 month old is fascinated with the changing colors in some of the more abstract pieces.

I thought the picture and sound quality was excellent.  However, I was a little disappointed in the Legacy DVD.  I found it difficult to maneuver, with less material than I had presumed from advertising.  I requested the Anthology version specifically because I wanted this part of the set.

1372525,5,B00004Y7S5,"Since 1940, Fantasia had only occasionally revisited us for one of its brief and infrequent appearances at movie theatres. Those of us who chose to see the first Fantasia had been graced by one of filmdom's more risky but enduring experiments. Disney's 1940 motion picture is the original inspiration for all subsequent conceptual MTV type Music Videos, especially of the 1980s and later. Stokowski's fervent presentation of the classical sounds are unforgettable.  We do not often benefit on such a grand scale from sublime genius and inspiration presented in slick multimedia convenience. ""Motion picture history was made last night...Fantasia...is simply terrific"" said Bosley Crowther in The New York Times, November 14, 1940. With the premiere in 1940, Fantasia had been released for brief theatrical runs only ten times in the next 50 years. It was seen again in 1942, '46, '56, '63, '69, '77, '82,'84, and in 1990. Those infrequent releases barred a great share of the market from convenient access.  Fortunately, the 50th Anniversary release returned to theatres in 1990 with its original Stokowski recorded soundtrack, extensively restored and digitally remastered to bring back and clean up his acoustic masterpiece. The genius of Fantasia is as much Stokowski as Disney. Stokowski was awarded a special Academy Award Oscar in 1941 for his ""unique achievement in creating a new form of visualized music"".  Let's take an imaginary trip back in time to visit the cultural roots of Disney's vision. Begin at an ancient Indonesian SHADOW PUPPETRY THEATRE a thousand years ago, and mentally travel through the smoke and mirrors and shadows of the Renaissance MAGIC LANTERN shows in Europe, then to the British theatrical LIMELIGHT of the 19th century. We would eventually arrive at the projected shadows and flickers on the SILVERSCREEN of modern motion pictures at the turn of this 20th century.  Fantasia builds on the Phantasmagoria media as presented more than 300 years ago. PHANTASMAGORIA literally meant an apparition or spiritual image with a powerful and realistic impact, sometimes invoked by poets of the Middle Ages in the midst of compelling commentary.  Phantasmagoria later came to be applied as a description of the mediated effects from Magic Lantern devices rigged to project changing images on a staged setting or screen. Picture size, apparent distance, shape, and sense of movement could be manipulated by a system of tracks for moving the lantern projectors closer or further from the resulting image while using mechanical lens controls to keep a constant focus. The occasional addition of a mechanical slide changer for colored filters and a variety of subtly painted, yet transparent, mood images enhanced the result. Elaborate set-ups combining these with smoke and mirror devices and sound instruments could provide illusions of significant complexity and moving realism (and hence the term of ""trickery with smoke and mirrors"").  These ""new"" techniques were used at the time to good effect by magicians and spiritualists. Such theatrical techniques were rediscovered and reapplied around the world beginning in the 1960s for dance, theatre, and film and termed MULTIMEDIA. Today we might say that desired illusions resulting from special optical effects, as well as from camera angles and lens choices, occasionally work a similar Phantasmagoria or ""cinema magic"".  The first Fantasia was the epitome of this electric circus in media-made America. Its infrequent releases and thinly distributed critiques have not yet established its central importance. Like Fantasia sixty years ago-an  electric  circus of its time- our new, changing  electronic  media  are  stunning,  dazzling, uplifting, educational, thrilling-and boring-and more than occasionally, tragic and dispiriting.",978480000,3,3811,5.470187393526405
1372526,5,B00004Y7S5,"When I went to Disney World for the Disney Institute's Animation Event, I was able to meet Eric and Susan Goldberg and many of the other directors and animators of Fantasia 2000.  They showed us all the hard work that went into it and then we got to make our own film to the music.  It was great meeting them and then seeing their work made me appreciate it more.  If your an animation fan, then your love it!",978393600,,409,4.151898734177215
1372527,4,B00004Y7S5,"First, the movies are masterpieces, and beautifully presented on these DVDs.  If you haven't seen Fantasia, it is Walt Disney's magnum opus - a collection of fantasy images set to classical music.  The music dictates the action, not the animators.  If you have ever caught yourself daydreaming a story while listening to classical music, you can understand the Fantasia concept.  The music in both movies is an outstanding selection from the classical world.  Disney choose some really amazing pieces, and the pictures they put to the music are some of the most adult things the studio has ever done.  If you haven't seen these films and you like classical music, I can hardly find a reason for you not to love these movies.
If you didn't catch Fantasia 2000 at the Imax theater, I do feel sorry for you.  A TV can hardly do justice to seeing that movie on such a large screen.  You MUST see F2K at hte Imax if you ever get the chance.  (I will see it once a year if they let me!)  Still, F2K does manage to live up to the Fantasia legacy without imitating or insulting.  The themes and stories are just as amazing, although I do feel like Disney reduced much of the cutting edge of the first film to reach a wider audience with the second.  The animation styles of the original movie were a collection of avante garde art styles of the time, while F2K is simply the normal style we're used to seeing in a Disney film, only more detailed and lavish.  Even the ""stream of consciousness"" opening piece has been reduced to a character story.
The individual DVDs contain wonderful documentaries with each film, and almost make the 3rd ""extras"" DVD moot.  The 3rd disc contains artwork stills from each segment, plus a very short documentary on each segment.  These documentaries hardly expand on thedocumentaries included on the movie DVDs themselves.  Even the reconstructed ""lost segments"" aren't that great, as they are mostly pieced together from concept sketches and poor-quality animation tests.  You'd be better off studying the sketches then listening to the music and let your imagination piece together the images.
Don't get me wrong, these are 2 of the best movies of all time, presented in beautiful DVDs.  I only nitpick because Fantasia is to be a continuing series, and I only want things to get better.  If you are a serious Disney fan, this boxset is worth it.  If you are a Fantasia fan, well, duh....",977961600,11,2415,4.6912114014251785
1372528,5,B00004Y7S5,"Well it seems that some people are disappointed with Disney's three disc box set, but to be honest I really can't see why.  Quite simply, this is as in-depth and as stunning as DVD can get really.
Apart from the fact that both Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 are two of the best animated films ever made, the sheer quality of the discs had my jaw dropping to the floor on numerous occassions.  Not only are we presented with THX sound, Dolby Digital and DTS which will give anybody's sound system a good working out, but the clarity of the picture is in all honesty the best I've ever seen on DVD so far.
For a film that's 60 years old, the quality of the print for Fantasia is especially impressive, with nearly every sequence full of lavish, deep colours that never fail to impress.  It proves that with enough work, a film even this old can still look stunning today.  Even the soundtrack comes across as powerful, although naturally the digitally recorded sound of it's successor simply blows the original out of the water.
Indeed, Fantasia 2000 is just as impressive as the original, even if it's far shorter in running time.  As for the DVD, well I am being totally honest here when I say that it reduced me to tears on several occassions, particulary in the power of the quite superb classical music used.  I may only have a Dolby Pro Logic sound system, but never, and I mean never has it produced quite as startling power before.  The climax of Respighi's wonderful Pines Of Rome had my front room full of sweeping, majestic emotions, matched only by Stravinsky's awesome The Firebird, where my subwoofer exploded into the kind of life I thought it didn't possess.  Amazing.
So, THE FANTASIA ANTHOLOGY is quirte possibly the finest DVD project ever produced.  Crammed full of extras which will take an age to get through, it's quite simply unmissable for any movie fan.
Finally, a note to people thinking of buying the Region 2 version of this set - don't!  If you're player can play Region 1 discs, this version has extra features not on the Region 2 version.  None of the commentaries are on Region 2, and it also lacks THX or DTS!",976924800,9,2137,4.553524804177545
1372529,3,B00004Y7S5,"Sixty years ago, Fantasia offered to the public something extraordinary: the world's first music videos of great classic music. Panned by the public desiring another ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", Fantasia lingered on in Walt Disney's originial vision; it being a continuing series updated and reupdated through the years. Finally succeeding with this vision, in comes the powerhouse Fantasia 2000. After seeing it in the theater, and nearly moved to tears at some of the segments, I eagerly awaited the Disney DVD release of both.
My anticipation has exceeded the actual product in some ways. After spending literally hours searching through the rich and excellent ""Ultimate Toy Box: Toy Story and Toy Story 2"", a bar had been set by that release. In my fair opinion, Fantasia strives towards that, but doesn't quite reach it. While Pixar seems to provide the public with what it wants in a DVD release, Disney still seems to struggle with giving away everything, making a good release, but not extraordinary, as the Fantasia series demands. After all, it's Disney who still proudly lists as an extra feature item on DVDs, ""decorative artwork on DVD"". Please.
Don't get me wrong,  this set is loaded with goodies. Outtakes from the originial, interviews with the animators, and running commentaries all add to the enjoyment of the movies. I spent more time with the actual movie DVDs then with the supplmental disc, which I found a bit lacking and uninteresting in a way. My favorite segment in 2000 was the ""Rhapsody in Blue"", and was fascinated with the development and story behind it, but cannot imagine returning to view that again as I have with other DVDs.
A longtime Disney fan, I probably come to expect more from this innovative company than the average consumer, thus the basis of my review. But I do believe they can give the public more with their DVD releases, which would only aid us in falling in love with their movies more.",976492800,11,1946,4.879154078549849

1372542,4,B00004Y7S5,"Fantasia has been my favorite movie since I first saw it. (I was about 7) When I ran across this boxed set, I jumped at the chance to buy it.
 Fantasia still retains it's magic. If you have never seen this film, I highly recommend it. Its truly the greatest piece of US animation out there. (While its rated G, its not *really* a kiddie film.) At times I did find the full introductions a bit too wordy. (Possibly because I'm use to the truncated versions.) And I'm not entirely sure they needed to include the entire 15 minute intermision.
 Fantasia 2000 is another story. Several of the pieces had OBVIOUS computer animation. 'Pines of Rome' was the one I found the most distracting. The Donald Duck and Flamingo pieces were both amusing, but I'm not sure either would stand up to a second viewing. 'The Sorcerer's Aprentice' gave the impression that the top and bottom had been cropped.(I haven't checked this, but they changed the aspect ratio somehow.) The intro's in this movie are why your remote has a chapter skip button. Use it. Overall, the new segments just didn't seem to hold the same magic as the original film, except for 'Rhapsody in Blue.'
 Fantasia Legacy is a disc for those of us who love extras. If you don't, you're probably better off buying the films seperatly. I haven't had a chance to go through most of this disc, but 'Claire du Lune' is a beautiful piece, and it's a shame they had to cut it from the original. That, and the partially developed ideas in the same section, do raise the question; Why didn't Disney use any of them when they made the sequel?",975110400,5,1585,4.515679442508711
1372543,5,B00004Y7S5,"The conception of Fantasia in the '30s was a work of genius. Nothing like it had been seen before, so it was a bold decision on Walt Disney's part to go ahead and make it. That it was an amazing success after its initial financially disappointing release proves how far ahead of its time it was. Maybe Fantasia 2000 disappoints because the idea of marrying music to images is no longer new or striking, but I'm willing to bet that we'll be enjoying it for years to come. This boxed set is brilliantly conceived, with the original Fantasia, Fantasia 2000 and a third disc of the Fantasia Legacy. Whichever way you look at it, value for money, enjoyment of the animation and music or the additional background information on the third disc, this is a genuine, gold-plated winner.",975024000,,777,4.63768115942029

Twenty-Two years later, boredom has transformed itself into stunned amazement. How many masterpieces such as this can be so beautiful as to facilitate tears? Not many...In a day and age where few can truly define art, this film is as far as one needs to travel when it comes to the art of animation. Disney has no peer when it comes to creating the tapestry in which both children and their parents can sit and be reminded of the beauty within the imagination, and the light that still burns so brightly in this world.

1372547,5,B00004Y7S5,"The Disney studio has finally done the Old Master justice. Most of the studio's ambitious efforts on DVD to this point have focused on the new works, conceived and created long after the death of Walt Disney. With the Fantasia Anthology, the studio's history begins to come alive, and to hear and see participants of that history, including Mr. Disney himself, is a treasure in itself. Considering all the archive footage available - especially from the original Disneyland television series - it is hard to understand why we haven't been afforded a deeper look into the films already available on DVD, including Lady and the Tramp and Pinocchio. This three-disc anthology does just that, giving us a chance to see Disney's pride in the original film's creation and then his disappointment in its failure to enchant the public. But was it really failure? As we're told here, much of the failure was because of the lack of technology available in neighborhood movie theaters of the 1940s. Background material, interviews, peaks into the filming process, sequences that were filmed and cut, and sequences that made it only to the planning stages - all are included here and are much appreciated. We learn why and how Mr. Disney proposed and created a marriage of classical music and motion pictures. Fantasia is remarkable film, and is offered here, for the first time on video, in its original road show format. Fantasia 2000 is highly entertaining and shows with great clarity the advances in sight and sound afforded by time and technology. The third disc, Fantasia Legacy, ties it all together for the true fans of the DVD format and movies in general. The reproduction is remarkable. The sound quality is outstanding.

Mickey Mouse has one segment in the first movie which is repeated in the second and Donald Duck shows up in ""Fantasia 2000"" but even these are more sophisticated than usual. Knowing how each movie was made- ""Fantasia"" was all hand drawn while ""Fantasia 2000"" is mostly computer generated did not make a difference to me.
