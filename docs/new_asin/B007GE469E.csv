I waited a year for the release of volume two, re bought this volume with it, and gave my first volume I had bought to a friend.  My kids were even trying out the techniques!",1364169600,,315,4.305084745762712
5085403,5,B007GE469E,"Hurstwic is famous for re-enactment and living history, and they bring that passion to his video.

The techniques demonstrated here are not flashy or showy, they are simple, brutal, and horribly effective. There are no extant texts on early medieval combat, but Hurstwic has done a fantastic job of re-creating what combat must have been like.

I can't recommend this highly enough, as well as William Short's book on the same topic.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viking-Weapons-and-Combat-Techniques/dp/1594160767/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viking Weapons and Combat Techniques</a>",1357171200,,627,6.924050632911392

5085405,5,B007GE469E,"I recommend this dvd to anyone interested in real combat (As opposed to SCA, role playing or sparring/points based combat).
It starts with an introduction about the viking people and some of their values before moving onto combat sections, which does a good job of explaining what viking combat is and some of the basics.

They do a good job of explaining how to start training if you have at least one friend willing to train with you, how to go about it and variations to build various skills.

This dvd truly is aimed at teaching you how to begin training viking combat in the Hurstwic system.",1355097600,,596,4.5607476635514015
5085406,5,B007GE469E,"I am always skeptical about groups and/or individuals resurrecting extinct fighting methods from the distant past, whereby said souls are attempting to devise appropriate time period exercises for learning issues of mortal combat from that part era.

I am a firm believer of studying history deeply and objectively, toppled with serious scrutiny and critical inspection.  We must learn from history so we really don't repeat the big mistakes in humanity.  Dr. William Short achieves this very attitude, producing an extremely valuable instructional DVD.  In addition, Dr. Short does this with a profound sense of genuine humility and accurate detail, always explaining how we must keep historical records in their proper place as we use them to guide us through discovering what was long ago.

I did not purchase this video from Amazon.com, but was given this as a gift.  After reviewing the materials for the third time, I needed to write something to support the professionalism, the historical accuracy, the humble approach used to create this training volume.  Though discussing and showing probable combat applications from a time long gone, Dr. Short accomplishes this with an entire realistic attitude.  This attitude of gentle scrutiny and critical inspection of past records--archaeological forensics, weapons' structures/manufacture and Icelandic Sagas--permeates Dr. Short's instruction and lecture in each Chapter.

Every morsel of data is kept in proper historical perspective, where current day contextual absolutes are NOT superimposed upon what was done during the Viking Age (793-1066 C.E).

Dr. Short is definitely a man with an eye for minute detail, understanding the importance of both teaching and helping the student fully comprehend the key subtleties found in this form of armed historical combat training.  Throughout this instructional DVD, the thoroughness given to explain and demonstrate positions, postures, movements, weapons, weapons use and the drills and sparring used to learn these motor skills, are as direct and straightforward as Viking Combat, itself.

I have not reviewed a better Instructional DVD addressing this topic of Viking Age Combat Training, to date (16JUL2012).  Well done.  I recommend this instructional DVD from the Hurstwic Group for both the accurate historical data therein, as well as for the training instruction covering this subject of Viking Combat.

5085407,5,B007GE469E,"I've reviewed many of the western martial arts (WMA) products over the years including the Jomsvikings and Regia out of Europe.  No one comes close to the authenticity that the folks at Hurstwic and Dr. Short put into this first volume on Viking Combat.

While all the others do a reasonable job of portraying vikings in combat, the folks at Hurstwic take it to a whole new level.  With Regia, Jomsviking, and the others, it seems more theatrical than real.  Not so with Hurstwic; you can see the true combat techniques unfold here with realistic training drills, sparring, and a depth of technique that comes from devotion to the topic by Dr. Short, the staff of the Higgins Armory Museum and the Hurstwic folks.

Highly recommended; also, see Dr. Short and Hurstwic's videos on fighting (7 short films) taken directly from the sagas on youtube.  Truly well done; you won't want to miss out on this video or the upcoming releases they have planned.

I've seen no better pre I33 training or early medieval/iron age technique out there.",1336694400,14,1035,4.780898876404494

5085417,5,B007GE469E,"DvD One is about fundamentals. Getting the elementary principles of fighting right and also, getting into the mindset of the fighter, in as much as we can as 20th century people. Hurstwic presents us with an introduction which is physical and dynamic, emulating the attitude of the warrior that used the weaponry. He needed to be fast, focused and able to fight into and out of conflicts, sometimes marching and rowing for hundreds of miles into enemy territory. The Hurstwic system infuses confidence building as it establishes an evolutionary trend, gradually increasing the novice's training with intensity and complexity.  Medieval HEMA in comparison lacks any such conditioning; modern fencers have added their own exercise regimes to their study of the techniques. This might be jogging, weight raining, circuit training or even boxing, oriental martial arts, bag work or even none at all. Hurstwic introduces a regime that bridges the gap allowing a non-martial artist to begin work with the weapons almost immediately by drilling them progressively with sweat making exercises and drills that can be directly transposed to real weapons. At heart, it is free flowing and organic. It doesn't ever suggest an un-natural movement or an ambiguity. Experienced HEMA practitioners should stop and re-think how they introduce their newbies to weapons after this Hurstwic offering and consider adopting Dr. Short's pragmatic and refreshing approach, one which could even be easily adopted for other cultural fighting systems.""",1371513600,7,1525,5.434599156118144

I would like to have seen the fighting techniques and strategies here demonstrated by experts rather than by students.

There is no mention of moving in ""true time"" for example. (that's the term I was taught in HEMA to mean leading with a threat that forces your opponent to defend themselves, so that they can't simply stab you... if you are going to move close enough to hit them, they are probably close enough to hit you)",1464998400,,431,4.684210526315789

8516300,4,B007GE469E,"This is a great introduction to Viking combat, and is worth the $25 or so that it costs. The production values are low, but that doesn't detract from the material presented. Mr. Short is a fairly good narrator and interesting teacher who I liked watching, but his tendency to rock/step from side to side as he spoke was a little distracting.

The material covered is quality. I like the Hurstwic method of training and will be practicing everything I saw in the video. Stance & movement, basic angles of attack, training equipment, defensive postures and movements with the shield, solo and partner drills are covered, as well as some of the Hurstwic philosophy of training and sparring. Something that I really felt was lacking - there was no specific demonstration of defense/offense with the two-handed Dane axe or the spear. The same goes for the single-handed axe, although in reality there seems to be very little difference between the Hurstwic method of sword use and hand axe use, so it's easy to go off of what's shown.

I was a little disappointed at the brevity with which sword cutting was discussed - no target cutting with sharp blades was demonstrated. Mr. Short advocates the hammer grip for holding a Viking Sword (I don't disagree with that, but some will).

An introduction to Viking wrestling is given - just throws, really. The purpose seems to be to slam your opponent down hard enough to break him or stun him, then finish him off from above. No attention is given to fighting from the ground, but that seems fitting given the context. Trying to pull off an armbar on a Viking battlefield might be a bad idea if you don't want to be stabbed by someone. A basic bearhug/takedown technique is demonstrated well.

The instructions for sparring were great. ""Leave your ego in a locked box outside the practice room"" was repeated several times. Good advice.
Mr. Short is quick to note that his fighting method is speculation - nobody can say for sure what combat was like. But I'm inclined to believe that this is an accurate depiction of how Norsemen would fight. It's aggressive, simple, pragmatic, and powerful.",1442102400,5,2133,4.788043478260869
8516301,4,B007GE469E,"On the subject of the quality of the DVD itself:
As seems to be common with small batch burning or on demand burning of DVDs, the disc I got tends to hang and display reading errors and artifacts when watched on game systems, some older DVD/Blu-Ray players, or DVD/Blu-Ray players with overly aggressive hardware based piracy protection. It played flawlessly in all the computers I have access to though.

On the subject of the content:
An excellent primer and teaser to get one interested and active in what they're doing. Despite being a fundamentals video, and thus very basic to the eyes of someone with martial arts experience (especially with my western martial arts/HEMA style background), there's enough unique information (the clear citations of specific sagas that information is being presented from is of special note) that even if I had bought it rather than gotten it as a Christmas gift, I wouldn't feel my money was wasted in the least.

Even better, the video is a VERY SOLID fundamentals video for people looking to enter into ANY martial art in the sense of how to conduct yourself when you train. Dr. Short discusses in the video not only how to be a good feeder in pad drills, but touches on how to be a good training partner in several other types of drills as well. In the ""sparring"" section of the video, he is very quick and clear in pointing out that sparring is not, and can not be by its very nature, an accurate representation of combat (how many times have we seen instructors in many systems say things like ""well in a real fight I'd just do this"" and execute a move that we're pretty sure cannot work without the safety rules of a sparring or ring environment) and how & why it is still a solid study and training tool in spite of that. Also, he emphasizes leaving your ego at the door repeatedly throughout the video and at one point clearly defines not only the importance & lack of shame of tapping out, but also what good tapping out looks/feels like. It's rare I see these things covered in many systems at all, let alone given this much focus and importance.

I'll definitely be looking to acquire Hurstwic's other training materials in the near future and bringing that knowledge into my portions of my training melting pot's usual meetings (as soon as we're not all caught up in the holidays and their associated delays).",1419552000,,2361,4.630071599045346
