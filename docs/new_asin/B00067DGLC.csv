8039753,5,B00067DGLC,"All the filmed stories come from beloved children's books.  My grandchildren aged 5 years and 21 months love the initial cartoonish Bark George story, and laugh out loud.  The next story about Dot the Fire Dog is OK (a little dated, reminds me of a very old version of the movie Fahrenheit 451), and teaches some fire safety too.  No Roses for Harry is really cute.  Grandma makes a dog sweater for Harry and he doesn't like it.  He tries to get rid of it.  Where it winds up is very funny and the story has a happy ending for everyone.  My 21 mo. old grandson is very interested in one of the bonus stories, A Boy, a Dog and a Frog.  A young boy keeps trying to catch a frog, with the help of his dog.  This is not a cartoon, but has actors.  Finally the boy gives up and heads home, hops into a bubble bath with his dog, and guess who follows them home!  Angus Lost is another bonus feature, again with actors and a real dog.  Set at a time when milkmen delivered to your home, the story is still basically timeless.  Dog runs away, dog finds his way home with a lot of luck.  There is a bonus story on the DVD called Whistle for Willie, about a boy who wants to learn to whistle for his dog to come. The DVD is 53 minutes in length, every story in full color. A great value and very entertaining for young children.",1377993600,3,1318,4.09765625

8039756,5,B00067DGLC,"My daughter thinks this collection of dog stories is funny.  As a parent, I love all of the Scholastic movie collections.  It brings our favorite books to life.",1316649600,,160,4.678571428571429
8039757,5,B00067DGLC,"We just got this dvd today.  My daughter is 4 and really enjoyed it.  It's our first Scholastic Video Collection dvd we've gotten to watch.  I bought a whole bunch but they haven't arrived yet.  So far, we are happy with this and anticipate that we will enjoy the others as well.

This dvd includes 4 animated stories (some more animated than others): ""Bark, George""; ""Dot the Fire Dog""; ""No Roses for Harry"" and ""Whistle for Willie"".  It also has 2 live-action short videos: ""A Boy, a Dog and a Frog"" and ""Angus Lost"".

The narrators voices for the animated stories are nice.  There's really no words spoken in both the live-action videos.  My daughter got a real kick out of George and what he has to say at the end of the story.  I really liked the section at the end of ""Dot the Fire Dog"" where there are fire safety tips.  I thought that was really great for my daughter to start learning.

I think my personal *least* favorite of the stories is ""A Boy, a Dog, and a Frog"" simply because I'm a mom and I'm pretty protective of my kids.  I kept thinking, ""why is this little kid by a pond all by himself?  He looks like he's 5 years old.  He could drown!"".  And then, when he comes home he's in the bathtub with the dog and even my daughter asked why he was taking a bath all by himself without his mom there.  I know, I know....it's just a story.  But still, I had to tell her that she can only have a bath when I'm there and she can't go running off somewhere by herself.  Other than that we like the dvd.

I had selected Play All and when it was all over it started playing again from the first story.  My daughter liked it enough to want to watch it all over again.  The dvd says it's for ages 3 - 9 (my 12 year old was in the room when ""Bark, George"" was on and he was interested in it enough to watch a little and even laughed) and it's 53 minutes long.",1198022400,,1863,4.088397790055248
8039758,5,B00067DGLC,"Each time we read this adorable book, my four year old squeals with excitment and laughs almost until it hurts.  Once your child is old enough to understand that a dog does not say meow, oink, moo or quack, he will find this book to be hysterical.  The image of the mother dog falling over when the vet pulls a cow out of George's mouth is entertaining for adults. This book is good fun for the family to share.",1190851200,,411,4.189873417721519
