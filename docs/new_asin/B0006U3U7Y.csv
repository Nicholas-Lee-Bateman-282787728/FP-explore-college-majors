8043281,1,B0006U3U7Y,"These films are cheesy 1980s martial arts flicks - they are what they are and you know what to expect...except I've yet to get a working set in two attempts.  Both my original order and my replacement copy had the same problem: Upon arrival two of the discs were rattling around in the case totally free from their spindles.  Furthermore, in BOTH CASES disc 3 had been scratched to oblivion by the gigantic RFID tag inexplicably placed directly under the disc in the case.  It's not even a case of glitchy performance or skipping; neither disc will play -at all- in either my DVD or Blu-Ray player.

I've seen ""Ninja: The Final Duel"" in the past and it's kind of funny - it's not as charming as Godfrey Ho's stuff or as actually watchable as something from Shaw Brothers, but this particular set is utterly useless because of what appears to be pervasive damage to the discs.  Don't waste your time and money.",1441411200,,909,4.552147239263804

8043283,5,B0006U3U7Y,"The first three discs are actually a six-part series. The fourth disc is the unrelated but excellent ""Ninja Final Dual"" which is worth the price of admission alone. Some reviews of the Ninja Death series have been critical, however, that's because they are being sold piecemeal as Ninja Death I, II, and III. This collection includes them all together in logical order. It features many of the Taiwanese characters we've come to know and love from from Robert Tai and the gang, including my favorite Kung-Fu actor of all-time Alexander Lo Rei (sometimes referred to as Alexander Lou or Alexander Lo)

My biggest gripe is that disc 3 of my copy didn't work. It must have been a manufacturing error. I can't dock it a star for that but definitely report it if you have the same issue.",1391731200,4,782,4.666666666666667
