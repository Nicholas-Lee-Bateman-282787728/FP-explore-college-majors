762454,5,6304030851,"This whole series is exactly what a documentary should be. It is wonderfully and lavishly filmed,  logically organized and edited, accurately and factually narrated, and refreshingly free of teleological  and biased theorizing. We see the facts and wonders of the plant kingdom  (and many of its relationships with the animal), but we don't get the usual  overdose of sophistic evolutionary explanations. For those who don't  believe in evolution, or think the concept is overworked, or are merely  tired of the plainly unecessary and overstretched evolutionary  ""explanations"" of the details of the plants' niches, this  documentary is a real relief, and an opportunity to enjoy the good side of  science without the dogma.",945561600,9,724,5.392857142857143
7859296,5,6304030851,"For anyone who has ever heard of this series from the '90s there is no need to review how great the program is.  What I want to review was the Polish version of this show.  This merchandise is EXACTLY as advertised.  It does have Polish menus, but the audio is English and it it easy to figure out how to access it since the seller included a brief menu translation.

The video is old (it is from 1995), but it is still very well done and aside from the slightly ""soft"" TV picture it is a very, very good quality recording.  The seller shipped this priority and it arrived over a month before it was promised.  Overall, if you are someone like me that has been searching for a region free version on DVD of this show you WILL be satisfied.  One caveat...the DVD will not play on my Sony Bluray player, however it plays just fine on my older Marantz straight DVD player.

Well worth the price.  I am a happy customer!",1466294400,,916,4.2485549132947975
7859297,5,6304030851,"Excellent video series for students.....the time lapse keeps their attention and without realizing it, they are engaged in the learning process.",1369267200,,144,5.904761904761905
7859298,3,6304030851,good copy but they sure can't spell Attenborough.  I actually have this ordered off of Ebay. Same mispelling and more on the back but it does play in my Region 1 system.  An excellent program but wish BBC would make a copy for us in the USA.,1369008000,,241,4.1063829787234045
7859299,5,6304030851,"This great series with a provocative look at plants and David Attenborough voice is a great addition to any nature collection. This VHS series is now finally available on DVD (but requires a region free player) It is interesting to contrast this view with the Botany of Desire. In both cases, the plants a winners and subvert human efforts to survive. Only this one was first!",1295395200,,376,4.712121212121212
7859300,1,6304030851,"The Private Life of Plants is a fantastic series, well worth buying.

So why the one star review?

Because VHS is an outdated format.  The same exact series is available on a 2 DVD disk set here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Private-Life-of-Plants-Region-2/dp/B0000AISJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Private Life of Plants [Region 2</a>] for one tenth the cost (as of this writing).

The only problem is that the DVD disks in the link are Region 2/PAL (instead of Region 1/NTSC as is common in the USA) so you might need to use a computer or buy a special player just to play the Region 2 disks.",1293926400,,647,5.505050505050505
7859301,5,6304030851,"Hi, I'm a college student and my plant ecology professor decided to show us these videos. I highly recommend them to any teacher. The representation of the passage of time from a plants perspective is truly enlightening. They manage to speed up and slow down the passage of time when needed to allow you to actually see the changes and growth of plant, noticeably. I found this videos to come to mind quite frequently and I have even been able to apply the knowledge I gained to other plant classes. I'm truly impressed with David Attenborough and his team. Once again, great movies for high school or college science teachers!!",1235865600,,628,4.718181818181818
7859302,5,6304030851,I spent a lot of money to replace an old homemake TV tape and my classroom parents have paid me back with the first showing.  I wish therre was a DVD set too.,1225238400,,158,3.787878787878788
7859303,5,6304030851,"David Attenborough is just great, and this is one of my favorites. Everything about this documentary is well done and interesting. I showed it to my kids - who didn't sound enthused about it - but they were drawn in despite themselves.",1123545600,,235,4.619047619047619
7859304,5,6304030851,"As you watch the plants via time lapse you realise that they are not the passive, peaceful and pretty things we use or destroy at our whim. You see the wild and violent world with similar predators, prey and power struggles  as the animal kingdon contains. It's just we move to fast (or don't look  closely enough) to realise it. P.S. sorry about the alliteration. T'was an  accident.",947030400,12,384,4.617647058823529
