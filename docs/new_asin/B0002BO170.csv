2075629,5,B0002BO170,"Lost in the Barrens is my favorite book of all time.  I am a sixth grade teacher in Idaho and I read Lost in the Barrens to every class.  They all love it and remember the story for years.  I would love to purchase the video but it has a different title.  Please help me if you can.

2075630,5,B0002BO170,"Hi,i gave this 5 stars,because it is a good interesting movie that doesent use swear words or have violence,so what does it then have? answer it has a very interesting plot ,and you might just get a warm fuzzy happy feeling, one thing is for shure by the time the adventure is over you will be thankfull to have a warm house to be in ,i always snuggle in a cozy quilt when i watch it,i also am proud of the movie because it was based in canada, and made in Canada,as i also live in canada,i enjoyed it because in canada we don't make alot of movies. The movie has a good plot,and is very educational and was made from a classic novel,and when i  went to school we even got to watch it in english class ,it also shows a lot of pretty canadian wilderness. the story takes place in the 1940's or so ,in the most northern part of manitoba canada ,which we call the barren's, because there is a lot of tundra(flat land with yellow dead grass) and tree's for shelter are very few ,and in the winter it get's deadly cold at times it could get -40 degree's celcious and you would die if you were lost in the barrens in the winter without survival skills in very cold weather,and also with very few tree's to find to make shelter .in the beginning of this movie the young boy(jamie) lives in toronto in a expensive upper class school that also is his home because he had no parents because they died in a car crash,when he was a young boy,and when he is a teenager his money his parents left him to pay to live in the fancy school runs out,so he has no choice but to go live with his only remaining relitive,which is his uncle that lives in manitoba,which he has never met before, in the remote wilderness and the uncle makes a living selling animal fur and makes canoe's and doesent socilize with any outside public his only friends before his nephue arived were the local native's, so once the boy arives at his uncles cabin,he is introduced to a teenaged native boy his same age,called awosis which is the son of the uncles good native friend,the young native boy at first despises jamie but they have to get over thier stubborness when they get lost up river and seperated from the rest of thier group while they were suposed to be waiting for the rest of the hunting party that had to go further into the barrens to find deer to eat for the winter,but end up sneeking away from thier camp to explore the river wilderness but end up in big trrouble when they loose thier canoe and get lost in the barrens with few provisions,and almost starve and freeze to death,and it just keeps getting more interesting from that point which i will leave to you to watch so i don't give away the ending,this movie shows no violence and is educational and exciting,it's a great family movie for kids or grown up's also,it was made onto dvd by some kind of family oriented company. the dvd is not to expensive ,so if like wilderness adventures give this movie a try what have you got to loose, i am almost certain you will love it as much as i did and i still watch it all of the time. the story is by farley mowit.",1095033600,31,3094,4.279863481228669

The story finds them battling problems of basic survival just like adults without problem-solving skills, without even the sense to avoid obvious mistakes. As in too big of a rush to secure ones only way out. Like securing the canoe. As with real life, an avalanche of problems soon befalls them.

We all grow battling monsters, whether real or perceived and continue to do so for life.

After having read this book, some years ago, loaned to me by a neighbour, I made a point of reading others....and seeing the movies. When I later travelled to Northern Canada, I had thought about this book, as I was in his much loved territory and that, somehow, made me feel more at home (even though it was -30 degrees below). Sadly, Farley Mowat is now no longer with us, but his stories will live on. If you want to know this author, then this book is a good starting point for you.

2075666,4,B0002BO170,"While many have said how much better the novel is than the movie, I haven't read the novel so I have only the movie to go on, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Two boys from very different backgrounds-one from a private school existence, the other living in a difficult and brutal climate- have to work together to survive 'the barrens', a place so forbiddingly cold and harsh, few can hope to survive it and tell the tale.

Both boys played their parts well and while the plot hinges heavily upon the Indian boy to get them through it all, the growing and evolving bond of friendship between them was great to watch. Their trust in each other becomes stronger with each obstacle they successfully surmount. Eventually, they became more like brothers than friends and faced some of the hardest challenges that the arctic region can summon up.

With courage and strength of will they continuously beat the odds and keep fighting to stay alive, but eventually, it's a tribe of Indians who are brave enough to live in those treacherous conditions that ultimately save the day and deliver them safely back home. Personally, I was hoping they would be able to do it entirely on their own but it still is an exciting film to watch. If you're into survival stories, Lost In The Barrens should definitely make it onto your list. 4.5 stars",1405209600,,1332,4.663829787234042
2075667,1,B0002BO170,"Depending on what you are looking for, this may or may not be a good movie, but if you are looking for the story of Jamie and Awasin and their adventure surviving in the Canadian arctic, don't waste your money.

This movie has almost nothing in common with the novel.  Just to give a couple of examples of crucial differences between the novel and this movie, in the movie Jamie does not want to go north to live with his Uncle Angus (what 15-year-old doesn't want to go hunting, fishing and trapping?) and Uncle Angus tells Jamie that Angus does not want Jamie with him.  The movie goes even farther astray after that.  If you really like the novel, I predict you'll be disgusted by this movie.",1404086400,,695,4.448818897637795

volunteer in her classroom. I read the book to them. They absolutely loved the story. Also, I had a video tape
of Lost in the Barrens which they saw as well. The main reason why I shared both the book and the video out was
because they were going to write adventure stories. There were other stories they read in the Adventure-genre!
They ""published"" their stories and all of them were in an anthology! Each student has a copy of the anthology!!!",1376438400,2,557,4.365384615384615
2075675,1,B0002BO170,"If you loved the book and hoped the movie would be more than very loosely based on it, guess again. What the movie and the book have in common - A caucasian boy, an indian boy, an indian, a white man, an eskimo, a caribou, a viking grave, a hunting trip, a cabin and snow-blindness. What the movie has that the book doesn't - A lot of preachy-preachy 1980s era political correctness and a lame story that wastes half it's duration on race education and spends very little time on character development and plot.

How hard is it to adapt a book into a film? Apparently it's harder than what one would think.

This movie is nothing more than the empty shell of the awesome story written by Farley Mowat. It is also an unforgettable abomination, a disgrace and a waste of money. At least I bought mine on an 8 pack disc at Walmart so I got several crappy movies for the price of what others are going to pay for shipping on this one.",1375488000,6,930,4.278409090909091

The movie took me through a series of events where two young men learn about survival in the wilderness of the barrens, how to cope with each others dramatically different backgrounds, and the uncertainty of their futures.  The movie has a wonderful ending that completes the circle of ongoing trials for the two young men, ending where they started; yet with quite different viewpoints developed.

I suppose it is inevitable that some teenagers today will be much too cynical to allow themselves to enjoy the movie, but I feel that is their loss.
