8431675,4,B004J6101O,It's really good stand... But sometimes I'm afraid if might fall and drop my saxophone but it's probably all in my head... It can be a little trick to get your saxophone out of the stand sometime when your in a rush... But I really like it... It's a little bit smaller in length like about up to you knees.,1431302400,,306,4.116666666666666
8431676,5,B004J6101O,Works great,1420934400,,11,5.0
8431677,5,B004J6101O,Perfect for displaying my Father's 50+ year old saxophone in my Mom's apartment.  The saxophone had been in storage for years and this stand made it possible to display it in her living room with lots of pride.,1416096000,,210,4.526315789473684

8431679,2,B004J6101O,"I wasn't pleased with the product due to the fact that the knob to change the position of the lower holder(?) was broken. I'm not sure whether it was caused by the delivery or it was already broken before delivery. It didn't really fit my custom made saxophone either; it moves around a lot and I feel like my double gold-plated saxophone will be damaged. I'm not saying I don't recommend it; I might be the unlucky one, but nonetheless I am not pleased with this product.",1388188800,,472,4.436781609195402
8431680,4,B004J6101O,"Folds so you take it with you. Adjusts enough to secure an Alto Sax.
(doubt you could fit a tenor on it)
Got it to work acceptably on my living room carpet. It works really great on a hard floor.
Doubt seriously that it would support a Tenor Sax on the carpet. Or at all without tipping over.
If you have an Alto and need a stand it works good and is affordable.",1377907200,,362,3.9726027397260273
8431681,5,B004J6101O,Very simple stand that holds my alto saxophone effectively.  It was very easy to assemble and I am very comfortable with its sturdiness.  It is easy to place the saxophone on and to know that it is safely stored.,1377734400,,212,4.410256410256411
8431682,3,B004J6101O,It could be because my saxophone has a weird curvature at the bell but I have put it in just the right spot for it really hold it. And even then it seems a little precarious.,1373155200,2,174,3.861111111111111
