8206194,5,B000SOSNDO,"An old movie, made a long time ago, in black and white.  What a joy to watch again! The humor, the interactions, and all the pieces and parts that come together for fantastic enjoyment. Good for grandparents to share with grandchildren.",1435968000,,236,4.7560975609756095
8206195,5,B000SOSNDO,thank you,1410912000,,9,4.0
8206196,5,B000SOSNDO,"This was ordered for an elder friend and he really enjoys watching Laurel and Hardy, usually still laughing about it when he tells about them.",1367193600,,142,4.72
8206197,4,B000SOSNDO,"Perhaps the *least* viewed L & H feature in my private screening (living) room, I can say how surprised I am by the overall quality of the film. Good storyline and script, wonderful black and white cinematogrpahy; the music is excellent (with ""I Can't Get Over The Alps""!), and the boys will be [the] ""boys""!

They arrive in Switzerland in formal attire as mousetrap salesmen and within about 15 minutes they are wearing kitchen aprons. But, by the end, they once again don the bowlers and suits (though pursued by a ""monkey"" - played by the same actor who played ""Ethel"" seven years earlier).

A litle tough to ""hang in there"", though, as the pace is slow, and Stan and Ollie are somewhat subdued; also, as some opportunities for real hilarity pass by, in favor of, shall we say, continuity. that situation would rear it's awful head countless times in the post-Roach efforts. Another downside is found in the ""pretty boy"" (not that there's anything wrong with that) portrayal by Walter Wolff King, as the tortured near-genius songwriter, who also finds his way to the Alps for seclusion and re-invention.",1353542400,,1106,4.815789473684211
8206198,5,B000SOSNDO,"The boys are in Switzerland selling mousetraps(Stans good buisness sense,Switzerland has the most cheese,they also must have the most mice)
Soon,Stan and Ollie are bought out and given bad money. The boys go to the local restraunt/hotel and eat their fill,but cant pay the debt. The boys are of course, put to work.
A composer,Walter Wolf King is staying at the hotel hiding out from his wife(Grete Nateler)a successful opera singer from Austria. Walter wants to make it without his wifes help before he returns to Austria.(!938,the couple would have a lot more to worry about when they returned home with Hitler about to take over. Thats Life)
Its a Great Laurel and Hardy film loved by all.
Lots of Great Tunes to go with it.
Mistake,The boys are ordered to take a piano to a treehouse so Walter can work in peace. The evil cook(Adia Kuznetzoff)who loves Grete,plants a bomb in the piano to get rid of Walter. The bomb scene was cut,so we see Stan,drunk,stupidly falling against the keys for no reason.",1325376000,,1004,4.775862068965517
8206199,5,B000SOSNDO,"Swiss Miss is great.  It took me awhile to figure out where to purchase this DVD, stores did not have it, Best Buy couldn't order it, so I was at a loss.  Thanks to Amazon I was able to get it for my husband for Christmas.",1231891200,2,222,3.8043478260869565
8206200,3,B000SOSNDO,"Producer Hal Roach makes the regrettable error of shoehorning Laurel and Hardy into a romantic musical that looks like a Jeanette MacDonald-Nelson Eddy reject. Fortunately, ""Swiss Miss"" (1938) includes some of Stan and Ollie's most memorable scenes - highlighted by their surreal encounter with a gorilla on an Alpine suspension bridge. Skip the dreadful songs and you will have a good time.",1220400000,,391,5.32258064516129
8206201,5,B000SOSNDO,"If everyone displayed the love that these two had for each other
 as friends the world would be a better place",1201046400,7,110,4.238095238095238
