7504564,1,B00LYHXFS2,I had to read other reviews and the IMDB to see if there was something I missed that would make sense of this mess.  I'm dumbfounded by this film.  I wouldn't waste my time on this one.,1451347200,,185,3.972972972972973
7504565,4,B00LYHXFS2,"There were a lot of issues. And I mean a lot. But you know what, well done on the guy. This was clearly their first attempt at a film and I can't imagine any of the other people that are leaving reviews would do any better. Keep at it if I am honest,  just sort out the sound levels!",1451347200,,283,3.7966101694915255
7504566,1,B00LYHXFS2,Just bad from begin to the end. I am sorry but noting good can be said about this movie. The title doesn't even tie into to the move at all. Nothing works is just a wast of time.. I was hopping it would get better but a bunch of 3 year olds could have done better.,1450051200,,264,3.732142857142857
7504567,1,B00LYHXFS2,"Ugh. This film is just a hot wet mess. Where was the budget?  Where was the director? Where was the witch? Do not worry, these and other questions you have can all be satisfied with one easy push of a button: A major fail of a film supposed to be horror, but put together more like a 9th grade report.  Ugh. So many problems, so little time.  Just do yourself a favor and pass this by. I should have, but no, I had to be curious.
This film is a mess, beginning to end. Nothing fits, and the plot line is obscured behind oh-so-polite British manners, and speech patterns.  IF there was a witch in this garbage, I failed to see.  Save yourself. Find another film to watch!",1449705600,3,670,4.203125
7504568,1,B00LYHXFS2,"Terrible movie. I can't think of one kind thing to say about it. And JFC, during the editing process, did anyone check to see after the sound track was laid, whether or not it was at an appropriately level? It was so loud, you would be better off muting the movie and read the close captioning.",1449705600,3,294,4.267857142857143
7504569,4,B00LYHXFS2,"Apparently, if you put together bad editing, bad acting, bad set design, bad costuming, bad direction, bad cinematography, bad scripting, bad lighting and production, you can actually make a movie that is fairly entertaining. For example, the sound fx of the town's men walking to the Reverend's house is badly off-timed and the sounds of their steps were completely inappropriate.  So, if you want to watch a movie that is actually a ""What Not to Do..."", or if you want to watch a trainwreck of a film, this is your baby.  Oh, um, I am still a little confused over the title...",1449446400,5,578,4.6568627450980395

7504571,2,B00LYHXFS2,Soundtrack/backing music track(s) volume overbearingly LOUD...  To the point of being a major distraction from what the characters where saying.,1449360000,2,144,6.2
7504572,5,B00LYHXFS2,"Not to be confused with either the Nicholas Cage starring vehicle or the chilling novel by Natasha Mostert, Season of the Witch is a non-budget 2009 film written and directed Peter Goddard.

When Alices Grandmother dies, she and her parents (Nicki Salmond and Dominic Ellis) head to the village of Maiden Hollow. Upon their arrival they are encountered by some uninhabitable locals leading to an unsettling and unwelcome stay. The only good Samaritan to welcome the family is Reverend Michael Howdy (Tim McConnell) who takes a shine to young Alice (Beth Kingston).

What follows as they fulfil their purpose is a close knit community who will not have anyone interfering with their ways and as the chemistry and mysticism between Alice and Michael develops, the locals don't take too kindly to rather horrific results.

Brilliantly scored and acted with standout performances from Kingston and McConnell, as far as no-budget films go the set pieces are unquestionable. It is in execution though that Season of the Witch doesnt quite hit the mark. Poor sound mixing and camera work married with a very extensive and boring first half may be a turn off for many. Apart from some artistic shots of dead animals, fast forwarding to the midway point will not affect the experience, rather improve it.

Goddard has injected the fact he knows how to craft a story and despite the shoe string budget, manages to cause effect that many big house staples fail to do. With influences to other British cult films including The Wicker Man and Blood on Satans Claw its easy to see how on a bigger budget this would be a classic and looking past the imperfections that come with a directorial debut, it is a superb entry to the genre that is a must for all fans of British horror.

We look forward to Goddards next project, Any Minute Now which is currently in production with a bigger budget and experience under his belt, Season of the Witch would be a proud starting point for many directors.",1416614400,,1980,4.794721407624634

7504578,1,B00LYHXFS2,"This movie was not even worth my 1 star rating...

The plot was abhorrent, the composition was heinous -- and as for the acting -- I am certain that these actors were on a really low budget because no one gets paid $$$ to act that way.

An hour and a half of my life that I will clearly not get back!!!",1473292800,,302,3.8548387096774195
7504579,1,B00LYHXFS2,music is much louder than the talking in the film. can't hear what they are saying half the time as the music overpowers it. Very slow paced.,1472256000,,141,4.2592592592592595

7504583,2,B00LYHXFS2,The combination of the poor streaming quality and the even worse production values of the film made it an utter waste of time.,1466380800,,126,4.521739130434782
7504584,3,B00LYHXFS2,"It's a British film, pretty low budget but still sort of creepy but also....I don't know. It's filmed in a way that feels like an homage to seventies horror films--dark, gloomy, sort of grainy. There are a few nightmare sequences that are actually really well done and pretty atmospheric....

But...

Dude, the MUSIC. Whoever made this film, it honestly feels at times like the wrong film score was applied to the movie. There are long sequences of dialog that are literally overpowered/drowned out by screechy violin or pounding piano. It's ridiculous, because without that awful music, the scenes, and the film, would be a lot better. I didn't finish the movie yet, but I will. I'll let you know at the end if it's worth a viewing, given that you have to get through that awful film score. I actually considered finding something creepy on youtube to listen to and muting the movie and going with subtitles a la silent movies. The music is THAT BAD.

Still, over halfway through the movie, I gotta admit, I kinda like it. Just hate that music!",1464134400,2,1338,4.754310344827586

7504588,2,B00LYHXFS2,"Tepid stuff. Not so much a horror film as the ""cover"" implies, but a long (long!) drawn out psycho-drama which culminates in murder and small town justice a la ""The Wicker Man"". So many loose ends, so many plot holes. Second star is for Ms. Kingston who has a certain charismatic quality that could serve her well should she pursue an acting career and get far, far away from this sort of amateur dreck. (Sidebar: Particularly in this age of search engines, I really don't understand why filmmakers don't research titles in order to avoid duplication and the resultant confusion for viewers.)",1455580800,,592,4.813725490196078
