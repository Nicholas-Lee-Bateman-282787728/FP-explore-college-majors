8022300,4,B000255JLS,When this movie came out I was in the Navy and saw it aboard ship.  It was so cutting-edge in those days.  I was surprised the Navy motion picture censors let it get by.  I purchased the film and viewed it again last year.  Ryan O'Neal's performance as a wet-behind -the-ears young man in the hands of a sly female still brought lots of laughs. I would definitely recommend it.,1410739200,,377,4.3428571428571425
