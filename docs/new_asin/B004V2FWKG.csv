8442682,3,B004V2FWKG,"Adhikaar released in 1986 deals with relationship of an estranged couple. SuperStar Rajesh Khanna and Tina Munim are playing the roles of the estranged couple. Both fall in love, get married and then separate as they are from different backgrounds. The characters have been well essayed by both Rajesh Khanna and Tina Munim This movie shows that when it comes to romance, emotions and facial expressions - the best actor for all the above attributes is Rajesh Khanna. The only draw back of the movie is its music by Bappi Lahiri. Apart from one Kishore Kumar number, there are hardly any other good number. However a must see for Rajesh Khanna fans and people who like to see sensible family movies.",1304899200,,699,4.785123966942149
