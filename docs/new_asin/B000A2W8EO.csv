8324929,1,B000A2W8EO,My son was very excited to receive this dvd!  He went to play it and it wouldn't play.  We tried every dvd player and computer and non of them would play it. It would have cost me more in return postage for complaint than I originally payed for dvd!  Needless to say I had a very disappointed child and was out $5.,1371427200,,314,4.032258064516129
8324930,5,B000A2W8EO,"This is a great DVD for kids who love the Wiggles.  My kids play it all year long - in fact, we bought this as a replacement for one the kids had ""worn"" by using it so much.  Great guests including Barry Williams (""Greg"" from the Brady Bunch) and John Fogerty.  Lots of classic Christmas music (including the non-secular ones for a change)and great original Wiggles Christmas tunes.",1310774400,,382,4.588235294117647
