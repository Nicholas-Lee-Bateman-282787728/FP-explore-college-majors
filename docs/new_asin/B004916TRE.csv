4287045,5,B004916TRE,Actually in the middle of watching this DVD set as I write this.  Season 4 is probably the best yet and I look forward to seeing the second half of the series.  The transfers are excellent and the show plays as well now as it did 40 years ago. Bravo to Paramount and CBS Distribution.  Let's see Season 5 before the year 2011 is out!,1296864000,3,333,4.092307692307692
4287046,5,B004916TRE,"I confess to a love of this show that goes back to when I was six years old.  Now, looking back over a lot of years, I realize how important this show has been to me, held largely in the background of my mind, for over forty years now.  But, beyond my personal experience, there is case to be made that it was the greatest television show, ever.

First, in order to achieve greatness a television show has to have themes that are great.  This show had a collection of some of the most fundamental and great themes that are important to our American culture: anti-establishment individualism, selflessness, a focus on deeds over money, wit and charm, and, above all, heroism, and it did it all without anything to hide behind.

Second, in order to achieve greatness, great themes must be presented in a pure form, without gimmicks, for gimmicks only serve to cheapen the themes and so when they are in the foreground, greatness cannot be achieved.  If the hero has to hide behind something, then he cannot be great.  This show had none of the gimmicks that were so characteristic of virtually all of the hero shows that came after.  This was not a buddy show, nor a reluctant hero show, nor an overly clever crime solver in the raincoat show.  This was a pure hero, portrayed beautifully by Mike Connors, who was ruggedly handsome and athletic, and yet seemed to have a natural way of fitting the range from extreme toughness to extreme gentleness, in the classic cynical yet gently humorous hero mold.  He was just out there as the hero, trying to be as real as possible with it, but nothing held back and nothing to hide behind.

Third, great television is about characters.  Books and movies can tell great individual stories, but television is unique in that it can allow you to develop a relationship with a character, so that the stories and settings ultimately serve to give that soothing, almost musical overtone to the way you see the character respond and behave on the screen.  Great television is like great music.  You can receive it over and over again.  Each time, through the soothing, welcome repetition, it changes you.  The same happens with relationships to great characters through the repetitive media of television.  Thus, great characters in television portray reality in the character's responses to situations and do not get bogged down in the details of the situations that drive the dilemmas.  Much has been made about too many beatings, bullets and car chases in this show.  But how else do you portray themes of greatness and heroism week after week, so that you can be infused by the character's response?  The story need only be plausible, the character is what matters.  Perhaps not coincidentally, Mannix had one of the great musical themes of all time.  Far from being separate, the beauty of the music and opening credits was entirely consistent with the rest of the show.  Violence blended with beauty.  Rage blended with gentleness.  Toughness blended with humor.  One drove the other like notes in a musical score that you can listen to over and over again.  After all, the beatings, bullets and violence only serve as metaphors for our own reactions to psychological things that happen to us in our own considerably more mundane lives.  Our hero gives us a model, or perhaps even just an excuse, for our own heroic responses when the metaphorical bullets and beatings happen to us over and over again as we try to contribute, help others and stir things us.  Will we respond with such grace?  Will we risk ourselves for the sake of others?

Fourth, great characters must be individuals.  After all, our greatest challenge in life is, according to no less than Carl Jung, individuation. No other show has produced a hero with such focus on being an individual as this one - right in a modern-day setting, without government secrets or hidden access to larger organizations, and without pretense.

Fifth, greatness in television requires that the actor fit the role.  This was one of those pairings where the actor fit the role so well, that it is almost inconceivable that it can be recreated.  Sadly for Mike Connors, after Mannix was finished you almost couldn't stand to see him on TV as anything but Joe Mannix - seeing him otherwise was actually upsetting. The mix of toughness, humor, cynicism and overall easygoing nature that he brought to the role made you feel as if you just watched the character over and over again that you, personally, could do better - that you should do better.  You didn't just watch this show to pass the time - you wanted some of what the character had.  It made you feel better about yourself to watch.

Sixth, the time period of this show is, of course, the golden era of television.  The dawn of great TV was when the movie studio resources and color first hit the small screen.  This was also a highly creative period, during which there were no roadmaps, and little competition from a few networks.  No less then Lucille Ball (Desilu) was involved with this series.  Much like her TV series, this show was all about a character, only with a dramatic instead of comedic focus.  At the same time, this was a unique time period in the US, the last of the post-WWII American optimism, fueled by the theme of the independent hero, which is perhaps the best kind of character America has to offer.  The result is a great piece of Americana that should be enjoyed as such.

Seventh, greatness often includes a contribution, over and above the bold portrayal of universal themes and types.  This show had, I recently learned from PBS's Pioneers of Television, a unique take on the way the story was told - a faster pace, more ""set-ups"" as Mr. Connors explained on the PBS show on Crime Dramas.  But, a major contribution that was left out of that PBS series discussion was the relationship between Mannix and his secretary, Peggy Fair.  He was white, she was black (as was proper reference in those days), and they were two individuals, sharing an awful lot of stuff and clearly displaying considerable affection, but of opposite gender.  Has there even been a pairing on TV quite like that in the past four decades?  And there were just the two of them, the only constants in the seven years of the series beyond season 1.  While Peggy's race was often simply ignored, it did occasionally come up and was addressed - which is much more honest than simply ignoring it, as Robert Culp claimed was the premise in I Spy.  Race was actually addressed in other ways in this series as well, and it was done so in such a way that it did not make a big deal out of it, did not take credit, it simply pushed forward.  Beyond that, Gail Fisher was a great actress - it is worth going through the DVDs just looking for the scenes between Joe and Peggy. They fought with each other in a close, adult way, this white guy and black woman, with a platonic closeness that has been unequaled on TV.  While the platonic closeness was forced by the lack of acceptance for an inter-racial relationship at that time (ironically, seven years after President Obama was born), the lack of being able to go any farther only served to fuel the closeness.  These were people who were like each other, but of different races and genders, with a bond formed through by having common goals - and platonic relationships like that can be of the most intense kind we encounter in real life.  And too, these were actors who could convey so much with their eyes.  Don't believe me?  Just get loaded up with the context of the characters by watching all of season 2 (in which Peggy first appears) and then make it to DVD #3 of season 3, which includes, ""The Sound of Darkness.""  Enjoy them relating to each other in that show, and then get to the very, very end.  When Joe's sight comes back, the communication is conveyed almost completely without any words at all.  It is  all done through the eyes and it is intense - and once you care about those characters you can watch that scene over and over again in the way great movie scenes can be watched.

Finally, I will relate a personal story.  Recently I started to watch seasons 1-4, after having collected the DVDs, but having to shelve them because of the need to deal with both personal and professional crises.  And too, I was afraid to become re-invested in a series I know I once loved, in case there was some stoppage of the release of the DVDs.  But, with half of the series in hand as of early January, I started to risk re-investing and watching during this past month.  In so doing, I realized that I watched this show from the time I was six years old - before I could read or write, with season 1 literally overlapping first grade (in an era without kindergarten).  I had a child's eye awareness of specific episodes of season 1, and progressive familiarity with subsequent seasons. Some of the scenes of season 1 were familiar as if viewed by another person held inside myself, and it was uncanny.  Most likely my parents had it on while I was allowed to stay up late on a Saturday night.  I now realize that I formed a relationship with the character, starting from then, and, as I grew, the show remained deeply important to both my internal fantasy life and external connection to the world around me until Paramount sadly ended it too soon in 1975.

Overlapping the very end of the series and over the course of the many years that have followed, I've had to survive some pretty extreme kinds of things, in both my career and family life.  In viewing these DVDs, I've come to realize that elements of this character, this show, have always been buried deep inside my head, and much to my surprise, even formed an excuse for the formation of some elements of my own character, elements for which I'd spent years wondering about the origins.  I seem to always need to go against the system (I am a female in a profession dominated by men from all sorts of cultures), am very unconventional in my work (academic research), and I'd rather make a difference than make a lot of money.  I try to be tough.  I try to stand up for others.  I take risks.  I try to have a sense of humor about the stuff that does happen to me.  Others in my family are not like this, and, believe me, I had no role models.  But now, through a lens of 40 years, I can see how I formed my model of what great character was.  And, I realize that some of the things I took away from this show formed the foundation of the best parts of myself.  Now, I realize that this will sound strange to many, and some will try to label or psychoanalyze me from a distance - but why?  Through all of recorded history, great stories can sustain us through a lifetime.  Why not great characters?

The too-long era of focus family values, greed and security has proved to be depressing for me.  But, I watch these DVDs and I feel re-energized, as if there is still a time and place where heroism, rugged individualism, a quest to lead an interesting life, and more of a desire to take risks in order to help others mattered more.  Why in the world would Joe and even Peggy repeatedly put their lives in danger all of the time?  After all, they had to know the next danger was coming.  Maybe they just wanted to lead interesting lives.  Maybe they wanted to live in the moment.  Mannix is about the American way of living in the moment, portrayed so perfectly sweetly that I can't wait to get back to the four seasons of DVDs I currently have in hand.

I can only hope that CBS/Paramount releases the remaining four seasons.  I've never understood why any form of art can be made unavailable to the public, either put in the public domain or made available for sale.  Art is what defines us as a culture, and this series so uniquely captured American values that it is truly a piece of Americana.  How can art be held from us?  After over forty years of walking around, living a mildly interesting and challenging life, and now looking back, this particular form of art - this character, this television series - the way I connected so deeply, is likely the source of some of the best parts of me.  I am so glad to have half of it back that words can't properly express it.  Now, I just hope for the rest of it to appear on DVDs, so that I may be infused by the visual symphony that is Mannix over and over again, and feel just a little bit larger than life, just a little bit more on track, just a little bit better potential of what I can accomplish as a human being and how I respond to life's situations each time I watch.",1296777600,10,12585,4.513907284768212
4287047,5,B004916TRE,"Well, I just got finished watching the last episode of season 4 about a half hour or so ago.  These  episodes seemed pretty well written, certainly action-packed.  Now, the sooner we move on to the 5th season (and the better the dvd's sell), then the better the chances they'll complete the series. I sure hope the season 8 episodes aren't forever lost to history, 'cos yes, like many others, I noticed that when the show was shown in syndication they aired early seasons but not the last one.",1296518400,6,493,4.579545454545454

4287049,5,B004916TRE,"Wow, so glad I can slow down and smell the coffee, now. I have finished the Mannix-season 4 pack already. The beauty of all of this is that I was around for the official first run of the series but too young to really appreciate and remember it like I am now. It's wonderful. I love this 60s/70s stuff like there no tomorrow. As a writer, myself I can see why I have been inspired to write; really good stuff.",1295049600,6,409,4.125
4287050,5,B004916TRE,"I just received Season 4 from Amazon and it has one of my favorite episodes!  ""The Mouse That Died"".  This episode is a remake of the famous movie ""D.O.A."".  Joe is poisoned and he doesn't know how it happened or why.  The doctors can't find the antidote, so Joe must work backwards, trying to find out who done it.  The doctor (Robert Ito) injects a mouse with the same poison to try to identify the poison and find a cure.  There's a lot of sly comments from Mannix about ""his friend, the mouse"".  This is a really well acted episode with lots of mystery.  Look for ""Leave It To Beaver's""  Hugh Beaumont in a few scenes!  I sure hope that every season of Mannix is released on DVD.  There aren't many shows like it!!",1294790400,8,718,4.2835820895522385
4287051,5,B004916TRE,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: Well worth the buy. Season 4 shows off Mike Connor's acting skills much more. I love the unabashed 'maleness'. I love that the women wore short skirts and were very feminine. Guys were guys and girls were girls. Not politically correct today, I know, but hey, IT'S MANNIX! (And just for the record, I'm a woman). There is action, good story lines. The producers were getting a little more liberal in what you see (hanging bodies, illicit affairs). God, that man gets bonked on the head more times!! But still, done in a way that the entire family can watch. Mannix had class! I have 2 disappointments. Somewhere in these releases I would like to see a tribute to Gail Fisher. Even in the Season 1 dvd Mike Connors barely mentions her. I find that very odd since she was integral to the series' success. And in that vein, Gail Fisher was hardly in this season except for a couple of episodes where she was key to the plot. In the rest she is kind of like window dressing. That was disappointing to me because when I think of Mannix, I think of Joe AND Peggy. The first episode is truly wonderful (Darren McGavin is unbelievably chilling here). My personal favorite. I thought it was setting the tone for their relationship. I mean, there was barely (if any) interracial stuff on TV then but they came mighty close in setting the tone for that here. A lot of verbal and physical nuances that showed their closeness. That last shot of episode 1 says it all. So I was thinking her role would be expanded. Nope. NOT in relationship to a romance with Joe, but just showing more of her. Nope. But he does send very flirtatious signals (in true Joe Mannix manner) to another African American actress (and rightly so...she was gorgeous) in one of the episodes here. So they were trying to set a tone. Maybe they were being cautious regarding Peggy due to feedback. Still, it was disappointing not seeing more of her. Watchers of Seasons 1-3 will recognize a lot of the same character actors in Season 4. Not to mention the SUPERB Jo Van Fleet (she was truly a great actress), Brock Peters and Diane Keaton. Mannix kept a lot of actors working and the powers that be were very loyal to these actors in using them. So all in all, still in love with Mannix. No doubt about it. I intend on collecting the entire series. Now I'm eagerly awaiting Season 5!",1294790400,14,2366,4.504651162790697
4287052,5,B004916TRE,"to bad hollywood has no talent these days behind or in front of the camera. mannix is a perfect example of when tv had class and talent. if you are into american idol and reality shows

4287053,5,B004916TRE,"This is another highly recommended season. More action, unique plots, great soundtrack and the wonderful presence of Peggy Fair (Gail Fisher). MANNIX's work as a private detective is very exciting and he becomes a man of great good sense, honor, justice and a nice sense of humor. This is is a great TV production. Unfortunately, there is no more productions that can attain the high level of quality that MANNIX reached. Vulgar language, low instincts, nudity and sexual exposure are not found here. There was enough quality in the plots with good camera shots, healthy actors and actresses, and general good humor. No need to display nudity or vulgarity to attract audience. We need more than ever that kind of production in these days of unfortunate loss of creativity. In a simple comparison, while McGarret does not relax in his arduous struggle with crime and shows almost no sense of humor, MANNIX works with the same seriousness, but in a more flexible way, demonstrating humor in unexpected situations. I could say, while the role of McGarret evolves in Hawaii Five-0 as the same intensity of a military march, MANNIX evolves as a great piece of jazz, sometimes developing the main theme with lots of control, sometimes allowing moments of inspired improvisation. Keep them coming, please.",1293235200,53,1298,5.0418604651162795

The second entry (""One for the Lady"", directed again by John Moxey) is also good because Mannix poses as a framed turncoat working first as a bodyguard and then as a demolition expert for an Italian female gangster leader ordering her gang of ""Mission: Impossible""-like con men (electronics expert, master of disguise/voice imitator, coordinator) to rob the safe of a naval air station. One of the best episode is an oddity: ""A Gathering of Ghosts"" (directed by Reza Badiyi) that is huit-clos taking place in a ghost town in the middle of the desert where Mannix is welcomed by a group of old friends who play a joke on him with bogus gunshots and a murder. The hoax quickly degenerates into real drama and then we follow a dark whodunit. The guest cast is fabulous: Robert Webber, Jason Evers, Charles Aidman, Alan Oppenheimer, Diana Muldaur and Marj Dusay.

But the finest adventure is ""The Mouse That Died""--a variation on the film noir ""D.O.A."" (1950)--: Mannix is poisoned with a nerve drug on his coffee by a third party who hides his illegal espionage activities about the stealing of a military project called ""Fishnet"" and Mannix has only 24 hours to nail him and to get the antidote. Director Sutton Roley's film-making is inspired by showing the symptoms of the main character, pale as a zombie, through three vivid hallucinations: the meeting with a satanist sect in a crummy building, the attack at the Puritan Laundry Service and the helicopter chase at the exit of a tunnel. Incidentally, one year later, Sutton Roley and composer Laurence Rosenthal will work again but on a supernatural pilot entitled ""Sweet, Sweet Rachel"". Another wild entry related to visions is ""What Happened to Sunday?"" (directed by Paul Krasny) in which Mannix looses the memory of the previous day after running away and being chased by two cars. It's filled with subliminal shots to emphasize the quick flashes of memory undergone by the leading man who investigates from place to place: The Monkey Bar, The Beauty Parlor, The Sea Breeze Dancing. ""Voices in the Dark"" (directed by Paul Krasny and guest starring Carol Lynley) is a tense thriller not to miss about a former swimmer for the Olympics who becomes disabled after a car accident (notice the quick subliminal montage during the prologue), lives reclused in her apartment and is threatened by a mysterious man but everything indicates it's all in her imagination when Mannix takes the case. One episode (""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"") makes a loose reference to the ""Twilight Zone"" segment ""Spur of the Moment"": a young woman witnesses twice the death of Mannix (in dream and for real) while going horse-riding in the countryside. The intriguing political-oriented ""To Cage a Seagull"" (directed by Paul Krasny) features two noteworthy scenes: a treacherous and militant secretary leading Mannix to an ambush and the escape of Mannix from the high cell with crude rock walls.

You can also appreciate two engrossing Syndicate in the countryside episodes: ""Sunburst"" (directed by John Moxey)--that starts as a season 2 ""Mission: Impossible"" holiday episode entitled ""The Town""--in which Mannix stops at a gas station held by a mobster (played by Barry Atwater) and his two henchmen on their way to eliminate a big brass (played by Brad Dexter) willing to testify against his people; ""Shadow Play"" (directed by Paul Krasny) tells the story of crooked chief of police Belden (played by John Vernon) and investment broker Sargent  on the payroll for the Syndicate and run the operations in a small country town when Mannix steps in to solve the murder of a woman.

Secretary Peggy Fair has an entire episode to her: ""The World Between"" (directed by Paul Krasny and guest starring Hari Rhodes and Albert Popwell) in which she ends up in the hospital after getting a missing bullet in the Paseo Verde office and falls in love with the Premier of an African nation.

Graphic design-wise: each prologue starts now with the MANNIX logo. The opening titles remains unchanged except the footages from ""Time Out of Mind""  recycled for the credits of actress Gail Fisher, wearing a yellow dress. Same previous configuration for the end titles which now gains yellow fonts instead of the white ones. Season 4 is yellow all the way.

Fashion-wise: Mannix carries his usual Italian Persol sunglasses in ""Round Trip to Nowhere"", changes them to some huge fancy plastic Ray-Ban in ""Sunburst"", ""D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu"", ""What Happened to Sunday?"" and also a pair of metal framed orange shades in ""The Judas Touch"".

SOUNDTRACK NOTES
For the music lovers, the orchestration tends to contrast with the past of the series by the introduction of two music supervisors: Leith Stevens (see ""A Ticket to the Eclipse"", ""One for the Lady"", ""Time Out of Mind"", ""Round Trip to Nowhere"") and Kenyon Hopkins (from ""Figures in the Landscape""). Lalo Schifrin makes his comeback after a season of absence and the first sign of change is the opener score (""A Ticket to the Eclipse"" with its dissonant organ music a la ""THX 1138"" that prefigures the theme of ""Scorpio"" from ""Dirty Harry"" combined with the ""Mannix"" theme rearranged a la ""Bullitt"", a drop of ""Charley Varrick"" and some harpsichord use from ""The Beguiled"") which paves the way for the rough Seventies leaning to come. For his last score (""One for the Lady"") on the series, Jerry Fielding lets a strong imprint due to his big band trade mark, tense martial drumbeats a la ""Hunters Are for Killing/McMillan&Wife"" combined with some moody cimbaloms, the stings of ""Kolchak"" and some soft romantic music for the Italian female leader foreshadowing ""Susan's Apartment"" and ""The Aircraft"" from ""Scorpio""; the score is well-tracked in ""To Cage a Seagull"" when Mannix meets leader Leonard Brix in his headquarters. Other composers contribute: Richard Hazard (""Time Out of Mind"", the dissonant and hip ethnic ""Shadow Play"" that foreshadows his music scores for ""Mission: Impossible"" between ""Kitara"" and ""The Bride""), Fred Steiner (""Figures in the Landscape"" is made in the same cloth as the season 3 ""The Playground""), Lawrence Rosenthal (the weird score ""The Mouse That Died"" that features an action-packed cue that is a proto-version of The Sandmen Theme from ""Logan's Run: The Series""; it's well-highlit in ""What Happened to Sunday?""), Joseph Mullendore (the retro 50's crime jazz score ""The Lost Art of Dying""), Lyn Murray (the sentimental and martial ethnic score ""The World Between""), Duane Tatro (""The Invaders"" type of lowkey score ""Round Trip to Nowhere"").

AUDIO NOTES
Unlike previous season sets, these season 4 discs feature English subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of hearing (English SDH) instead of closed captions (CC).

PICTURE QUALITY NOTES
The transfers oversaturate reds to such a degree that interlaced artifacts rear their ugly heads constantly when something which is colored richly red starts moving.",1299801600,20,8724,5.020732550103663
4287081,5,B004916TRE,"The fourth season of Mannix, which originally aired on CBS during the 1970-71 US TV season, is another classic season of the detective TV series starring Mike Connors as private detective Joe Mannix, with Gail Fisher as his secretary Peggy Fair.

The digital remastering is as good as with the first three seasons on DVD, and the presentation of the disc menus is as good as before. Fingers crossed the fifth season is released later this year. It's not Mannix the TV series, but Here's Lucy: Season Four (which is released on DVD in March) includes an episode in which Mike Connors guest stars as Joe Mannix.",1298419200,6,609,4.691588785046729
4287082,5,B004916TRE,"After a good, if somewhat inconsistant third season,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mannix-Fourth-Season/dp/B004916TRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mannix: Fourth Season</a>&nbsp;was a smashing success, well-written, solid, and offering Mike Connors in top form. At 45, he still had the rugged good looks that could make female hearts melt, but he also was beginning to show his age, which actually improved his portrayal, and made him even more likable and 'comfortable' for family audiences. Paired with Emmy-winner Gail Fisher as secretary/best friend Peggy Fair, and Ward Wood, Robert Reed, and Larry Linville as his long-suffering but loyal police pals, the chemistry was simply perfect, and irresistable to 1970 audiences.

Among my favorite episodes of the season, I'd include ""One for the Lady"", where Joe is accused of a shooting and robbery, and nearly loses everything; ""The Mouse that Died"", featuring 'Ward Cleaver', himself, Hugh Beaumont, in an innocent man tale with a twist; ""The Other Game in Town"", set in Vegas, guest-starring Rich Little, and a victim who may not really be dead; ""What Happened to Sunday?"", with Joe drugged, again; and ""With Intent to Kill"", as he attempts to clear police detective Dane Clark {one of the few cops who DOESN'T like Joe}. But truthfully, I loved ALL of Season Four's episodes!

Whether you are collecting the entire series, or just want to enjoy the nostalgia of a TV detective, four decades ago, you won't do better than this! My only regret is no commentary track by Mike Connors, himself {still spry, sharp, and quite handsome at 85!}",1297987200,8,1634,5.532
