8465989,4,B004BV7GUQ,"A pretty fun movie. I like it more than many American slasher films of the same style, but the last reviewer really nailed it when they said the movie felt like an American slasher with Taiwanese actors - they even got the ""horizontal throat slit"" right. Many, many references and similarities to Hostel (part 1 and 3 especially), and a lot of gore. Even on your first view you can spot a few problems, but it was an enjoyable experience and I have already watched it more than once!

and I'm not gonna lie... watching that Ferrari accelerate from the driver's perspective was pretty B.A. :)",1447632000,,591,4.5754716981132075
8465990,3,B004BV7GUQ,"Well, first thing's first. You should all know that this is not your standard Asian Horror movie. It is filmed as a straight Slasher. Seriously, it feels like an American film but with Asian actors. So don't expect anything like ""Ringu"" nor anything like ""Audition"", because this film is completely different.

The premise of the film has been done to death ""Get invited to party. Killer on the loose. Try and Escape Party"", and although this one tries to throw a few curveballs and keep you guessing, the twists are fairly predictable. The real redeeming feature of this film is how likeable the two lead characters are. In a lot of American slashers, the characters are so dislikeable, that you are actually rooting for the bad guys, but this film really does have you rooting for the good guys. There is some suspense, a couple of well-timed sharp shocks, a good amount of gore, some nudity and even a pretty decent car chase.

Yes, the film has it's flaws and plotholes and the final scene is actually quite awful and extremely rushed, but for the most part this film is a good way to spend 90 minutes on a quiet evening and is definately worth a look.",1326412800,,1156,4.579710144927536
8465991,3,B004BV7GUQ,"<strong>Invitation Only</strong> (Kevin Ko, 2009)

The beginning of the last decade saw film cultures we never thought we'd see doing it releasing silly zombedies, from Greece's <em>To Kako</em> to Ireland's <em>Dead Meat</em>. At the end of the last decade, the trend had shifted to torture porn. (Unless you were already doing torture porn. Norway, for example, slapped <em>Dead Snow</em> on us seven years after they released their first torture porn film... and, one should note, they beat the US by three years in <em>that</em> particular race.) 2009 saw two countries I never thought would release torture porn films release their first torture porn films. Thailand gave us Tiwa Moeithaisong's <em>The Meat Grinder</em> (viz. 16Mar2011 review), and Taiwan offered up Kevin Ko's <em>Invitation Only</em>. My first gut reaction, writing on a list where we're encouraged to let loose with our first impressions, was ""Moeithaisong gave us a better film--it was more like <em>Mother</em> than it was <em>Hostel</em>--but Ko knows a lot more about what makes this kind of movie tick."" In the week since I watched it, I have yet to come up with anything that refutes that as a solid base for a longer review.

Ko, a first-time director working from a script by first-time writers Sung In and Carolyn Lin, gives us the story of a young man, Wade Chen (<em>Yang Yang</em>'s Bryant Chang), a ne'er-do-well who makes his living as a chauffeur. After he catches his boss in a compromising position, said boss gives him an invitation to an exclusive party the boss can't go to for reasons he's evasive about, presumably to buy his silence. The back of the invitation invites Wade to write down his fondest wish; he does so, then heads for the do. When he gets there, he finds out he's one of five new ""members"" to this exclusive club. Pretty much by default, the five come together and start talking. There's Kao, an award-winning concert pianist (Yin-Hsuan Kao in his first screen role); a power-hungry politician, Legislator Lin (fellow newcomer Joseph Ma); Holly (Vivi Ho, another, yes, you guessed it, screen debut); and Hitomi (Julianne Chu, another newcomer), a maid/caregiver. Wade is kind of hitting it off with Hitomi before Dana (Japanese porn star Maria Ozawa, who recently broke into mainstream success with a number of appearances in Kekko Kamen franchise flicks), an up-and-coming fashion model Wade is obsessed with, cuts in, and we think maybe we know what exactly it was Wade wrote on that card... except it's <em>after</em> that bit that a couple of the party's bouncers hunt Wade and Dana up, the rest of the group in tow, and say it's time for them to receive their gifts. Wade's is the first of the batch, and when the bouncers pull the warehouse door aside... well, that would be telling. But I'm not a [x] guy, and even my mouth was watering. Wade's totally stoked, and grabs Hitomi (who seems none the worse for Wade ditching her for an hour to go live out his fashion-model fantasy), and they head for... it. (Trust me, it's worth the surprise.) It's so sexy you almost don't notice one of the bouncers turning to Richard and saying ""your piano is ready. Come with me..."". Which turns out to be very important, since that's where the film turns into the gorefest it so badly wants to be. This isn't a complete spoiler; before the warehouse scene, we see Dana get hers after Wade has left the room. In any case, the remaining four soon stumble upon Richard's body, and after Lin goes nuts, they find themselves scattered to the wind, with each of them picking up a little more information about what's going on. And, of course, trying to keep their heads on their shoulders.

You know what really sucks about torture porn films, in general? While most of them are pretty darned good at the setup (and those that aren't, e.g. <em>Train</em>, you're better off just forgetting exist), the follow-through is rarely as worthwhile. I always go back to the Big Reveal in <em>Saw</em>, and the envelope-pushing shocks in <em>Men Behind the Sun</em>. Few modern torture porn directors are willing to spend as much time on story as Wan and Whannell did in the former, or abandon story almost altogether like Mous did in the latter. We inevitably end up with the worst features of both styles, or we end up (as we did with Moeithaisong's flick) with something that isn't torture porn at all. Ko takes us down the exact same paths so many other directors have before, most notably John Stockwell (<em>Turistas</em>), though Ko and his screenwriting team are more interested in class war than xenophobia. But there are so many threads here that, if Ko had used them, could have turned this into the first really good torture porn film since Stockwell's five years ago. I mean, the screenwriters actually came up with a really clever hook vis-a-vis <em>why</em> these particular folks show up at this party. It's multi-layered, it shows a great deal of thought, and then... it's abandoned. Which is all the more frustrating given the movie's final scene, which is arguably its best... or would have been had Ko returned to that clever, well-thought-out hook and <em>brought it back into play</em>, which is obviously where that scene was going. But no, it just kind of ends. (Which, I guess, is better than going on ten minutes too long, like <em>The Last Exorcism</em> did.)

For being what it is, a torture porn/action thriller that never really has any intentions of being anything else, <em>Invitation Only</em> is pretty good at what it does, and is certainly better than anything America, Europe, or Japan have turned out in the genre in the past half-decade. But I still can't give it anything higher than an average rating, because it could have been more and it isn't. Why bother cluing the audience in that you have those pretensions and then never acting on them? It's baffling. ** 1/2",1307664000,,5900,4.867661691542288
