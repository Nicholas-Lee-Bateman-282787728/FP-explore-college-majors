872635,3,6304432437,"Sylvester McCoy's second full story, while not an extremely memorable or highly rated piece from the classic Dr. Who series, is a huge step up from the disaster that was Time and the Rani, his first appearance.  For me, that ranks as the absolute lowest and least enjoyable the show ever got, and we had to wait one more episode to finally see the start of the 7th Doctor's real persona, that would carry on with him throughout his 3 season tenure.

Others have criticized Richard Briers over the top turn as the Chief Caretaker, but I found it fit his character, especially after his body was taken over, and is not that far off from some other crazed villains in Who lore.  In the end, I don't feel it detracted from the story.  What I did feel was a let down were the cheap looking sets involved.  This was supposed to be an architectural mecca and Utopia, and there were no remnants of this anywhere other than the pool sequences, which were shot in an actual private residence in a very large indoor pool building.  Now, I know the show is known for its cheap sets, but I felt this was the one story that should have had a decent location interior that fit the story better, rather than the usual cardboard gray walls.  The informative making of documentary features further complaints about the writing and about the way the characters appearances looked in the final story, as opposed to the script.  The Caretakers were all supposed to be old and overweight, and the Pex character was supposed to have a hulking, Rambo-like physique.  I still say the visual aspects brought the story down for me more than the acting, or actors.  I found the actor who did end up playing Pex to be quite believable.

Most of the story features Mel and the Doctor being separated, so most of their bonding would have to be put off until the 3rd episode of Season 24,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Delta-and-the-Bannermen-Story-150/dp/B002945DXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Delta and the Bannermen (Story 150)</a>.  McCoy and Mel both feature strong performances, as do all other performers, with the exception of the women portraying Kangs.  However, most of that can be attributed to the script, and their awkward, child-like dialogue; and also the fact they did nothing but chant during some of their scenes.  The story moves along at a very swift pace, and with the Dr. and Mel off in different areas of this giant high rise building, there really aren't any slow or dull scenes.  The robots, while very plastic in appearance, keep up with the low budget monster and robot effects the show has been well known for.

Bonus features are excellent on this single disc set, with a very informative making of documentary, and a ""Girls of the 80's"" feature focusing on Tegan, Nyssa, and Ace (seems strange that Mel is absent).  All 3 original actresses are back together, talking amongst themselves about their costumes and how women of the 80's were portrayed.  I did feel it lost its steam 3/4 of the way through, and the topics they started going on about became rather boring.  It should have been 10 minutes rather than 13.  The informational text, as in other Dr. Who dvds, is too fast at times, causing you to hit the pause or rewind button, unless you are a very fast reader.  It's got some good history on the show, but also lags in places with some meaningless attempts at humor.  The commentary does not feature any lead actors, and therefore, I didn't listen to very much of it.

One area where both the commentary and the informational text failed is the scene where McCoy is looking at a promotional video about Paradise Towers.  If you look closely, there are scenes from a 1980 art documentary called The Shock of the New (episode 4 to be exact, which was titled the Trouble With Utopia and was the one episode in that 8 part series to feature architecture), which is intercut with some interior stock footage of the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.  This promotional video for Paradise Towers within the story is portraying it as looking like the spacious, modern interior of the National Gallery.  Again, with a script and storyline that is supposed to depict an elaborate work of architecture, the interiors scenes inside the ""real"" Paradise Towers look nothing like the modern architecture within the Gallery's East Building.  Without a mention in the info text or commentary, I still have no idea where this footage of the National Gallery of Art came from, but would love to know.  I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere when referring to this episode, either.  As vast as the internet is and how thorough every episode of Dr. Who has been dissected over the years, I found it odd that no one has ever touched on this, not even the BBC here on this DVD.

Overall, an average Dr. Who storyline, one I rank better than its bad reputation, and a big leap forward for McCoy after braving the terrible script that came before it,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Time-and-the-Rani-Story-148/dp/B004MA1JZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Time and the Rani (Story 148)</a>.

872636,3,6304432437,"The story concerns a community of people trapped inside a tower block. If it sounds very similar to J.G.Ballard's novel High Rise, that's because it was inspired by that book, as the writer admitted to me shortly after broadcast.

The Doctor and Mel are on good form, BBC lighting department not so much, and robots look a bit lightweight. Otherwise some interesting performances populate this unique world, with its own languages and customs, making for an enjoyable watch.

The only sour note is the performance of Richard Briers as Chief Caretaker. Briers had huge success in BBC sitcoms such as The Good Life and Ever-Decreasing Circles, playing believable characters with a degree of charm. Yet when presented with a Doctor Who role, he elected not to take it seriously and to ham the whole thing up. His shameful performance removes all credibility from the story and renders what would have been a nice, quirky little tale laughable instead.

872768,3,6304432437,"""Paradise Towers"" is a very early 7th Doctor story entirely based in a dystopian high-rise on an alien world. Things are falling apart, and the residents, caretakers, and young people are left to their own devices.

The story is essentially pretty good, being partially inspired by ""Concrete"" a novel by J.G. Ballard. Unfortunately, some over the top acting and dodgy special effects weaken the overall episode (even more than usual for '80's Doctor Who). It does have some positive points, the teenaged girl-gangs have some fun slang, and their hair-styles are so very '80's. The two menacing resident ladies are well acted, and provide comic relief. Unfortunately, that's one of the overall problems with this episode, it's hard to take it seriously at all. However, it is a decent episode, just not the best of the 7th Doctor's . . .",1373414400,3,836,4.929078014184397
872769,4,6304432437,"The Doctor and Mel have traveled to Paradise Towers. Mel wants to use the pool on the top floor, while the Doctor wants to explore the building arcitechter.  When they land in the TARDIS they find that things are not what the brocuhe claimed it to be. Trash everywhere, rats running freely and graffiti on the walls. The Doctor and Mel haven't long before they are captured by the Red Kangs. A group of all female warriors who are at war with the rivals the Blue Kangs. They wonder who the Doctor and Mel are since they do not fit in with any of the others who live within Paradise Towers.
  Before they can get any more questions out of them the care takers arrive on the scene to apprehend the Red Kangs and make them pay for thier ""wall scrawling"" as they put it. Mel is seprated from the Doctor and encounters one of the ""Rezzies"" old women who seem to like Mel a great deal and want her to stay for a cup of tea. MEanwhile the Doctor has been arrested by the care takers and taken before the chief care taker who mistakes The Doctor for The Great Architecht, the one responsable for the creation of Paradise Towers in the first place! The Chief care taker decides to put the Doctor to death while the Rezzies are preparing Mel for dinner. In comes Pex ""Protector of Paradise Towers"" and all around dim blub when it comes to what is going on.  All this and the fact that people Kangs, Rezzies and Care Takers go missing never to be seen again.
  Can the Doctor save himself, Mel, The Kangs, Pex and everyone else from the hoorors of what is going on in the basement of Paradise Towers? Will he figure out what the Great Architecht has to do with all of this? Or will the Doctor become another vistor of Paradise Towers never to return?",1315958400,2,1739,4.302752293577981
872770,2,6304432437,"This is regularly listed as one of the top ten worst Dr. Who serials.  Honestly, I don't think it merits the extreme hype.  That said, this is strictly fan territory only and really isn't good enough for public consumption.

There are a lot of great ideas here, but ultimately while the camp can be allowed in favor of satire, some of the camp is just bad writing.  This is supposedly a violent place and yet while there are cannibals and killer machines there seems to be far threats of danger than any one person pulling it off.  Because every human acts tough but doesn't immediately deliver the whole world seems fake.  You compare Paradise Towers to an apartment block from Judge Dredd and see which holds up to scrutiny.  While there were some fun ideas, I'm not sure it works as a Doctor Who story.  The Doctor and Mel just seemed forced into the picture and feel totally out of place. Their motivation is inane.  They want to go swimming in luxurious swimming pool (that looks like a crap hotel pool).

Again, there is no chance for chemistry between the doctor and Mel.  They get separated through most of the show so we never really see them interact.  Mel is always in a hurry, unless she has time to eat tea and cookies...and scream.  Still, McCoy is starting to coming into the part.

The biggest problem with the serial (outside of this era's horrendous music) is that the whole thing starts to fizzle near the end.  It presents itself as satire and then when it is done presenting all it came with, then you have two more predictable episodes to go.  The actors aren't given much worthwhile to work with, so they either do nothing interesting, or overact in the extreme.

With a good story editor, this might have been a nice two-parter, as it stands it is flabby and awkward.  Even as a fan that buys most of the DVDs I'm skipping this one.",1313971200,4,1856,4.48955223880597
872771,3,6304432437,"Having rewatched this for the first time in several years, I can confirm the opinion I gave in a comment a few months back -- This is FAR from being the worst Doctor Who story ever made.  Is it the best?  No. But it's eminently watchable, with much to recommend it.

The story line is clever, though it does have some gaping plot holes. (What DW story doesn't?)  A group of 'oldsters' and 'youngsters' are left in a 300+ story apartment building while the 'middles' go off the fight a war.  The middles have (presumably) died ... and the PT residents are left to fend for themselves, surviving however they can. But surviving is made more difficult by wandering cleaning robots and *something* that lives in the cellar...

The sets are appropriately grimy -- no shiny white corridors here. Just live rats and wallscrawl.

The acting is mostly decent. Darling Richard Briers does overact a bit (and more than a bit towards the end), but the Kangs all do a good job, and Pex is believable.

The clever use of language adds a nice touch to the proceedings. (Though.. here's a question ... why doesn't the TARDIS 'translate' the odd terms? Presumably the PTers aren't speaking English anyway.)

The extras include the usual ""Making of"" documentary (in which most participants are apologetic that it didn't turn out as well as it might have), some deleted scenes, a disposable commentary (the writer and a guest star or two -- neither Sylvester nor Bonnie took part) and a mysterious 20 minute documentary on the Doctor Who Girls of the 80's.  Mysterious because it features Sophie Aldred, Sarah Sutton and Janet Fielding (who does most of the talking), but NOT Bonnie Langford. Surely it would have been better placed as an extra one the Ace stories?

In summary, if you're going to cherry pick only the ""Best"" DW discs to buy, this one can be left on the shelf.  But if you've never seen it, don't let its poor reputation scare you off.",1313366400,8,1933,4.652941176470589
872772,4,6304432437,"This story does not deserve the bad reputation it has received over the years. Some consider this to be one of the worst stories of the classic series. I happen to think this is good sci-fi.  To me sci-fi reflects the way the characters are impacted by the science and the environment around them.

Here we have an odd batch of people who by happenstance ended up living in the great Paradise Towers.  But something went terribly wrong and as a result these scattered subgroups formed.  We have the Kangs, the Rezzies, and the Caretakers who continue to perform their routines even as this great residential achievement falls by the wayside.  The special effects are not really needed here although I think the Cleaners work well for the time period.

The Kangs have developed their own language. The Rezzies have taken up cannibalism with a cup of tea. And the Caretakers continue to live by the rule book.  But what else are they supposed to do because this is the way they have lived for years. One good thing about this story is that Mel doesn't scream quite as often as earlier stories.  So that is a relief.

I was a bit disappointed that neither Sylvester McCoy or Bonnie Langford were involved with the DVD commentary. Maybe even they believe this to be some of their worst work. The extras include some extended scenes and a behind the scenes documentary.  There is also a short documentary about the female companions of the 80's.",1312934400,,1440,4.6561264822134385
872773,4,6304432437,"My favorite Sylvester McCoy episode by far.  A massive futuristic tower block, warring gangs, a murderous robot, cannibalism (but funny!), betrayal, murder, misdirection and mayhem with Richard Briers (of The Good Life / Good Neighbors fame) playing a Hitler-like character who thinks he's running the show but isn't.  You can always go for a swim in the pool if all this gets to be a bit much...  An enormous and wide-ranging story with perfectly-paced exposition as the story unfolds, shock, humor, occasionally one gets the sense that one can see where the story is going then suddenly...WRONG!  Very well done; keeping that many 'objects' in the air while juggling is an impressive feat and the screenplay and directing do just that, all the way to the end.

872855,3,6304432437,"The one star review was Really harsh! The five star review was perhaps a bit generous. Somewhere in between lies the truth. As a huge Doctor Who fan and an admitted completeist, I have placed my order for this DVD.
I recall watching this episode on my local PBS station as a pre-teen and I admit I have not seen it since (15-20 years ago). But I do have some vague memories of it along with the original Target novelisation. I remember it as a fair McCoy outing and worth a viewing. It certainly is no Caves Of Androzani or even a Rememberance Of The Daleks, but it is a fun part of the 7th Doctor's history and not a complete horror.
Maybe I'm just a soft touch or just a damn fool. Maybe I'm just trying to reconnect with the 12 year old boy I once was who sat with his popcorn and Coke and tried to piece together how all these different guys could be the same Time Lord. Regardless, I still have fun watching even the weakest adventures of the goiod Doctor. So I say buy it if you want to or save your cash if you want to. I'm gonna enjoy it either way.

PS How about we try to tone down the vehemence and sometimes vicious personal attacks directed at certain reviewers. We can surely disagree, even with all our two hearts, but let's not get so damn angry. It's just opinions of a TV show! Whatever happened to civilized debate? Let's all just remember that we're all united as fans of a classically awesome cult TV show and not take it so unbelievably seriously! It's not worth getting so angry! (Again, my opinion.)

If you don't like the actual plot/story so much, then (and I'm altering a favorite Pertwee saying here) ""don't buy it!"" (Pertwee said you can turn your TV off if you don't like Doctor Who).

Anyway (again), sure this may not be the best Doctor Who story ever made, but I find it annoying that someone posted tons of words and actually went out of their way to prevent folks from buying this DVD when it comes out. Sorry to say that it is part of the classic Doctor Who universe and will be released with everything else that exists. Not buying the DVD won't change that.

872857,1,6304432437,"IT is said the opinions, like certain lower gastro-intestinal portions of the  body,  are something that ""everyone has"". While this is most certainly true I respectfully submit that some opinions are worthy of public display and carry a certain level of validity. That being said I offer the opinion that Paradise Towers is the worst episode in the entire 26 year run of the classic series. In short it is dull, poorly written and even more poorly acted (and that includes 7th doctor Sylvester McCoy) and in a word mindless. Say what you will about other surveys and polls regarding the classic series that have taken place in the past but I would much rather watch The Twin Dilemma, The Gunfighters and Horns of Nimon all running on a continuous loop while I am hanging upside down in the middle of a brood of Tetraps.
But talk is cheep. Opinions mean nothing with out some thought or reasoning behind them. With that I offer this nugget of wisdom.... Amazingly Doctor Who lasted more than 26 years from it's first broadcast in 1963. For all of it's faults ( cheesy monsters, dodgy acting and shaky pseudoscience) the only fault that plague the show through out it's run was the BBC's (and perhaps some of the British public's) inability to realize and accept the shows global appeal. I believe this is what ultimately caused  the show to end in 1989. Every time one of the show's producers would try to elevate the show to a higher level, some BBC big-wig and/or the Mary Whitehouses of the world would push the show back to what the BBC and the British public (for the most part) perceive the show to be....And that is a children's program. But lets be honest here Dr Who NEVER WAS and NEVER IS a ""children's program"". If it were it would not still be standing nearly 50 years later nor would it evoke the passion of Sci Fi fans (and even many non sci fi fans)  around the planet.  Say what you will about John Nathan Turner but he of all the producers knew this to be true that no matter how hard you tried the show would never be allowed to evolve past the Childs show perception (or  at least that was true for the classic series). God knows he did try to break that perception with such classics geared toward the adult viewer like Earth-Shock, Kinda, Enlightenment, Caves of Andrazani, Vengeance on Varos and Revelation of the Daleks but in the end he, like Lambert, Letts and Hinchcliff before him, failed to break the mold and the collective conscience of the public's perception of the show. After the shows 22nd season the BBC and the general public out cry made the final push back on the program and it was once and for all forced to be the childish, Gimmicky show that it was never meant to be. With his hands now permanently tied JNT was forced to produce stories like Paradise Towers. Mindless, One dimensional stories that fit the mold or the ""Perception"" of the show. Doctor Who's British-ness is an essential component of the show that can never change but in the end we got episodes like Paradise Towers that were ""intentionally British""....And ultimately the Doctor Who became this sad, Caricature of itself. Doctor Who was forced to look like it's former self in stead of being allowed to evolve in to the global phenomenon that it had become. They created this new Doctor and made him buffoon around in some form of weird homage  to Patrick Troughton and buried him under a thousand question marks on his costume and just to make shore we noticed they stick a question mark umbrella in his hand ever other scene. Did we really need this type of gimmick 24 years after the show was created? Wow. The question mark can be an a acronym for the word WHO. Thank you so much for pointing that out to me as I would have never picked up on that on my own (forgive my sarcasm). And then we get a companion who's sole  purpose was to look and sound British for no other purpose than to look and sound British...and of course to scream the traditional 1960's Who girl companion scream. If you watch Bonnie Langford you can actually see her stop in place and look a the director off stage queuing her to yell at the top of her lungs. Pathetic. I remember thinking did they just look for some actress who could scream loud.
How does this all tie in to Paradise Towers? Easy. Paradise Towers is the poster child (or poster Doctor Who episode) for those who would not allow the show to evolve and for those who used their power to keep the show locked in it's formula and the public's perception of it as a children's program. Stephan Wyatt's  script was a poorly written rip off of Lord of the Flies and A Clockwork Orange. New script editor Andrew Cartmel clearly had no clue how to script edit a Doctor Who story (and quite frankly I don't think he ever figured it out in his three year run). The acting is one dimensional and as I mentioned before ""intentionally  British. 7 Th Doctor Sylvester McCoy's worst performance by far (I know he was still new to the part but that is no excuse). Bonnie Langford was simply a card board cut out and paint by numbers companion.  Howard Cooke's Pex was beyond annoying and the two room mates Tilda and Tabby were like nails on a chalk board and look like they belong on the set of ""Are You Being Served"" ( I admire Brenda Bruce and Elizabeth Spriggs for their many other fine performances but they just don't work here). The real tragedy was Richard Brier's Chief Caretaker. The performance falls completely flat on it's face/ His face. How did this brilliant actor blow it? It is still a mystery to me. Last there are the yellow and red kangs...You know forget about them and just trust me that they are terribly acted and will make you want hang you self from boredom.
I have been waiting a long time to trash this episode. It is everything I hate about what the show was forced to be and it is a reminder of how a show I loved was halted in it's evolutionary tracks and reduced to a small, unrecognizable shadow of itself. Buying this episode or ever watching this episode again would be  like  admitting that BBC controller Michael Grade was right about the show...Which HE WAS NOT. (I understand that he is still in high position at the BBC. I hope it is just some glorified position with a title, a paycheck and no real power). If you buy ever episode of the classic series then finish your collection but if you only buy classics from the classic series than avoid Paradise Towers like you would avoid the plague....It is complete garbage.
PS. For the record the new series succeeds because it is what the classic series was never given the chance to be...A British tradition that became a global phenomenon watched and loved by adults who sometimes let their children over ten/eleven watch the show.",1301616000,20,6760,4.508571428571429

Some of you will understandably feel nervous at leaving everything you know for a strange new environment.  However, we believe once you've tasted the Paradise Towers experience you won't want to change it for any other.  Our motto is Build High For Happiness.""  --prospectus of Paradise Towers.  Additional prospectus follows:
Ground level:  the main materials for this story is J.G. Ballard's High Rise, with supporting structures Monty Python's Architect Sketch, Lord of the Flies, and A Clockwork Orange.  However, include a wandering Time Lord and his red-haired companion Mel, the former who wants to explore, the latter who wants to enjoy the swimming pool at the top of the 304 story building, only to find the Towers littered and graffitied.
Level 42:  Now, meet the Kangs, Red Kangs, who are a gang of crossbow wielding, graffiti-spraying girls in red outfits and rinsed red hair, led by Bin Liner and Fire Escape, who take to the Doctor's ""ice hot"" clothes, but not to Mel.  And to stir things up a bit later, some Blue Kangs, who are a gang of crossbow-wielding, graffiti-spraying girls in blue outfits and... you get the idea.  Unfortunately, we only see one Yellow Kang, who like many others in this story, become, in a phrase used by the Kangs, ""taken to the cleaners"" or ""made unalive."" Some of their lingo seems taken from Orwell's Newspeak from 1984.
Level 68:  Here, we have the Caretakers, the authority wearing Fascist Germany-style grey uniforms who are after the ""wall scrawlers"" or Kangs.  Their officious bureaucratic-ness will make the most hidebound Dickensian clerk blush with shame.  However, some of the Caretakers are being ""made unalive"" as well.  And observe their funny salute, hands held under noses and the chant ""All hail the Great Architect!""  Very Pythonish, yes?  Oh, there is a Chief Caretaker who does have a funny mustache akin to the leader of the Third Reich, and a hidden agenda of his own.
Level 100:  The Rezzies or Residents who appear here are elderly, and seem overly kind and generous with tea and cakes, such as Tilda and Tabby, but beware their other eating habits.  When Maddy tells of a Caretaker's disappearance and says ""There's always something left behind,"" Tabby surreptitiously covers her full plate with her napkin.  Hmmm...
Level 125:  This is Pex, a self-appointed ""musclebrain"" who ""is here to set Paradise Towers to rights"" and is eager to help Mel find the Doctor, while at the same time hiding a dark secret, for which the Kangs have a taunting nickname for him.  However, he is useful at breaking doors down.
Level 205:  Three special appearances here:  Richard Briers (Good Neighbors) does a job as the Chief Caretaker, who's quite a psychotic maniac.  Judy Cornwell (Maddy) is best known as Hyacinth's sister Daisy in Keeping Up Appearances.  Elizabeth Spriggs (Tabby) would later appear as the Fat Lady in the first Harry Potter movie.
Level 244:  Extra ""ice-hot"" performances: Annabel Yuresha (Bin Liner), Julie Brennon (Fire Escape), and Catherine Cusack (Blue Kang Leader, named Drinking Fountain in the novelization), who is the youngest daughter of Irish actor Cyril Cusack.  All are attractive young ladies who add life to and are the best things in this story and have lots of fun with the Doctor.
Level 304:  Despite having a closeted studio setting, and its criticism of adopting a more stagey pantomime style, the lighting is good, and indicate a new style for Doctor Who.  Enjoying the Doctor dancing with the Red Kangs in Episode 1 depends upon how light a mood one is in.  We hope this ice hot video will make you unsad.  Thank you, and Build High For Happiness.",1076803200,22,3736,4.901273885350318
872859,5,6304432437,"I love this film. It is really neat that the people in Paradise Towers have lived there all of their lives. With acceptions to the elderly people; who used to live on earth, all of them are being ruled by an Villianous evil robot that lives at the bottom of the building.
It is up to the Doctor to destroy the evil robot that rules the tower. The robot has so many enemies around, especially those garbage collecting machines, that roam around killing people.
There is even three girl gangs that themsleves ""Kangs"". There is the red, blue and yellow. The yellow Kangs were killed off by the Villian's army, so the only Kangs left are the red and blues. They both hlep to destroy the Villian and save Paradies Towers, before they all die.
This video is pure fun, and is a must have for all, Sylvestor McCoy fans. I love his sidekick, she is so cool. You've got to have this one!",1075593600,2,877,4.353658536585366

Before I saw this episode, I had never really cared for Dr. Who all that much. Whenever my brother watched it I would halfheartedly watch it just to keep him company, but I became a fan after viewing this episode. This is a good episode for viewers new to Dr. Who to watch because it is easy to understand and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Plus, it has a cool 80's feel that is impossible not to love. Before you give up on Dr. Who, try Paradise Towers.",1073520000,2,565,4.053571428571429
872861,3,6304432437,"The highlight of this Dr. Who story for me was the wonderfully comic perfomance of Richard Briers as the Chief Caretaker. He is perhaps best known to us as being a member of Monty Python, but I will always think of him as Tom Good from the Brit-Com ""Good Neighbors"" (a.k.a. The Good Life).(The title of my review is from an episode of that show BTW.) In fact the acting overall in this one is very good. Another brit-com celebrity, Judy Cornwall who played Daisy in ""Keeping Up Apperances"" , also makes an apperance. The story, while entertaining, is a bit silly however. People being chased around by big lumbering mechanical cleaners is just a little far-fetched. I'd give it an extra half or maybe even 3 quarters, but we can't do that. I also did an earlier review of ""Dragonfire"" which I gave 4 stars and said it was the best of Season 24 and I must be consistant, mustn't I?",1002153600,3,880,4.438271604938271
872862,1,6304432437,"Not even Richard Briers can help it meander to any point of redemption.
Terrible acting.
It is plagued with the overtly pretentious and ludicrous writing that followed much of McCoy's era. (Excluding ""Remembrance"")
Impossible to watch without fast forward and cringing.
Maybe, just maybe I will consider 2 small scenes with the caretakers as slightly enjoyable. But after weighed against:
The cannibal residents, the Kangs, the cleaners, and pex...  Avoid.
It is my least favorite, on all merits, of the entire run of Dr. Who.",1002067200,7,526,5.188235294117647
872863,3,6304432437,"After the dreadful 'Time and the Rani' things could only get better.  Thankfully this second McCoy story is an improvement with its imaginative vocabulary (ice-hot, etc) and its well-thought-out charicature of an inner  city tower block.
In fact 'Paradise Towers' has the potential to be a  classic.  But where the whole thing falls down is in its on-screen  execution.  For a start, most of the actors involved go way over the top -  Richard Briers is especially awful, putting on the most feeble  impersonation of Hitler I've ever seen.  The garish sets, idiotic action  scenes and far-too-colourful costumes make the whole thing look like its  taking place in a 60's sci-fi comic book.  The rhythmic, upbeat music is  often completely out of place and the awful Mel does little but wander  about with a stereotype hardman (well, he's more of a kids TV would-be-hero  to be bluntly honest).  The story itself is, admittedly, not without its  flaws.  How, for example, does Mel fail to notice a giant bright-yellow  robot on the surface of a clear swimming pool?  And why are people pulled  through an impossibly small hole by a cleaner robot which is apparently  inside a waste disposal pipe?
There are some good points.  The 'cowardly  cutlet' Pex being the only person in the entire towers with the guts to  stand up to Kroagnon provides first-rate pathos and a nice ironic twist,  and the scenes in which the Doctor outwits his caretaker guards are  clever.
Overall this story is entertaining in an undemanding way, but you  can't help feeling it could have been so much better if only a few more  people had taken it just that little bit more seriously.",957830400,3,1659,4.804270462633452

7870814,5,6304432437,"VERY VERY creative and ingenious!  I would just recommend that you watch it with English subtitles to be able to catch everything.  the sound wasn't that great, so that you can catch everything you really ought to turn on the subtitles.  the script is so well-written and air-tight that it's easy to miss the details that make it great.  the idea of a building being a place where different classes came in to live to survive a war and then they all faction off, trying to survive the villains and simply to live is actually very well-done, well crafted, and I think this is an unappreciated story.  the awesomeness of this story precedes dystopian contemporary epics like high-rise today, which have similar ideas, but I feel that paradise towers does it better.  it has the vide of the decade it came out in (which was the decade that I was born in, interestingly enough), but it doesn't have the flaws of the era.  only the good stuff.  watch it with subtitles, and believe me, you will appreciate the story and understand that it's actually genius.",1489449600,2,1052,4.648648648648648

7870821,3,6304432437,"Paradise Towers is a great concept of the Doctor and Companion landing in a creepy run down apartment building to find it overrun with killer machines, cannibalistic old people, and ravaging gangs of teenage girls known as Kangs, and the whole thing is guarded

The concept is quite good and it's a very nice script for Sylvester McCoy as in his second performance, he delivers a very Troughtonesque performance and is quite fun to watch as he befuddles the caretakers, befriends the Kang, and searches for Mel.

Mel keeps the screaming down and remains almost oblivious perky. Still, I actually like the character, and she's far better her than in the Mark of the Rani.

This is also an interesting story because you have the Doctor and Companion confronting danger in an apartment building, which was far different than what we'd seen where dangers were on alien worlds, or haunted houses, or came from Dalek or Cybermen invasions. The setting of an apartment building is very innovative.

The production of the story is its ultimate downfall. Bad music, cheap design, and some poor performances drag down what would have been a great story to only being fair. Still, it's enjoyable for what it is. Though, it's tantalizing to thing how much more it could have been.",1429660800,,1268,4.856481481481482
