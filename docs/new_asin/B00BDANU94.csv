5581373,5,B00BDANU94,K-11 is totally bizarre but engages your attention all the way through. You feel as if you have spent time with a band of misfits whose extreme situation speaks to the alienation that I feel at times and I assume that most people do.,1373241600,,233,4.318181818181818

5581376,4,B00BDANU94,"Raymond Saxx (Goran Visnjic) finds himself in jail and needing a fix. He is charged with murder, which he is unaware (bad plot point) and through the dealings of a sadistic drug loving gay guard (D.B. Sweeney) he finds himself locked up in K-11 section of the grocery aisle with fruits and nuts. He manages to get along fairly well. There are personality differences and corruption abounds which makes for the plot, consisting mostly of interesting character interaction, but moves slow linearly.

I enjoyed watching a prison film with the diverse characters. Mousey (Kate del Castillo) was not the tough transsexual cardboard character, but was rather realistic, showing weakness as well. Butterfly (Portia Doubleday) was an interesting hermaphrodite who sometimes spoke poetically. They should have named her Swan and had her speak in rhyme all the time. The could have done so and might of added some humor to the tale.

The DVD cover makes it look like Raymond spends his whole time in a dungeon like cell. That was not the case. This is a film for those who enjoy the interactions of unique indie characters. The gay couplings, what few there were, are not graphic. No one shows off their junk.

5581377,5,B00BDANU94,"I loved the movie. It was violent at times but the evil ones got their punishment before the movie was over. All of the cast done a superb acting job. Kate Castillo made you believe she was a transvestite. Goran Visnic was great in the movie, I have loved him since he was on ER. Markus Redmond,Ralph Cole Jr and Luis Moncada were all great in the movie! Jules Stewart keep up the good work. I do wish the movie had a wider release in the theaters but I would have bought the dvd anyway.",1366761600,4,487,4.136842105263158
5581378,1,B00BDANU94,"Someone likely had a good idea in planning this film: place a straight man in a prison cell area reserved for homosexuals and all variations of gender role playing. That concept could prove interesting as an exploration of `community' among the `unwanted' of detainees. But as written by Jared Kurt and Jules Stewart and especially as directed by Jules Stewart the film loses all semblance of originality, for one reason - because it casts women in the roles of transsexuals and transvestites so as not to offend the actors or the audience with same sex variations.

But that is only one reason this film sinks. The script is tepid to poor, a story is practically nonexistent, and the characters are tropes played by actors who seem embarrassed by what they are asked to do. What little story there is can be summarized as follows: a wealthy but drug addicted and alcoholic record produced named Raymond Saxx (Goran Visnjic, one of our stronger actors usually) passes out, is arrested for homicide, and thrown into LA County Jail in a unit reserved for Homosexuals and sexual deviants K-11. From there it is a power struggle run by transvestite Mousey (the first female - Kate del Castillo - cast as a male and it doesn't work). Cocaine and other drugs are readily available through the corruption of Ben (Jason Mewes) who works in the office of the deputy Sgt. Johnson (DB Sweeney) who is likewise drug addled and preys on the inmates for sexual favors. Bad things happen, such as the murder of child molester Detroit (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister) by transsexual Butterfly (Portia Doubleday) and Raymond finally comes out of his cloudy drug abused head and figures a way out of this very odd confinement, but not without a series of meaningless circumstances that serve only to point out the depravity of the inmates.

Yes, it is that bad. Try as you may to find a saving grace to this film is without success. Perhaps if the writers and director had had the courage to use an all male cast instead of putting female actors in the roles of men who are range from simply nelly to butch to surgically transformed (in various stages) into transsexuals the film may have had a reason for being made. As it is, it is an embarrassment for Goran Visnjic, and DB Sweeney and the rest of the actors who for some reason signed on to this poorly conceived and made project.

5581379,5,B00BDANU94,"This film is different and its no surprise that the  mediocre press  don't get it. To make judgements they need something to compare it to  and only thing they have are camp or exploitation films , so they do ,  only K-11 is neither of those. The cast includes 3 transgender's in the main cast and lots of gay men. Forgive any reviewer who doesn't know that, lots of people are going to see this film for whatever they want to see. The attacks on the director , Jules Stewart , simply because she is Kristens mom are unending as gay Hollywood loves a target. This is an amazing first film. James Camerons first film ,Piranha Part Two: The Spawning, earned a hefty 3.5 out of ten . Fascinating because Cameron wrote the screenplay under an alias  :)

It's a good little film, entertaining and fast paced. Goran Visnjic, Kate del Castillo and Portia Doubleday are all superb.  There are wonderful cinematic shots and filmic poetry throughout. Ignore the pedestrian musings of people hooked on formula Hollywood films. You will have fun . Kristen Stewart appears only as a voice in this film but she was to play the role of Butterfly. The producer and director decided not to cast her as  the character because of the negative press they knew they would receive for it. The role was completely rewritten for Portia. There is absolutely nothing  for the producer and director to feel ashamed of because for a first feature ,it's pretty amazing.",1364688000,5,1440,4.637795275590551

5581411,4,B00BDANU94,A very realistic view of what goes on inside the prison walls.  It was brutal and honest.  Not for the faint of heart.  You never quite find out how the main character ended up in K-11.  They brush over it but not enough for me.,1397433600,2,228,4.0
5581412,2,B00BDANU94,"As a cisgender male, I really haven't been as in-tune with the plight of transgender folks until recently.  But being an ethnic minority and sexual minority, I can certainly sympathize with issues of representation in art and media.  There is a saying:  ""Representation saves lives.""  I believe that.

I did not like K-11 because of its portrayal of transgender people in incarceration.  Specifically, I do not like that the transgender women were portrayed by cisgender women.  I think that was unnecessary and inauthentic to the story being told.  I am not speaking of ""passability"" per se - even though I never once believed these actresses as trans-women.  I am moreso speaking on the blatant disrespect of the trans community and trans actors and actresses.  For as low-budget as this film had to be, it would have been a wise investment to find new and emerging trans actresses to give these characters more authenticity.

The story itself was flimsy and largely unengaging and the performances were cartoonish.  However, I did enjoy seeing Goran Visnjic again.

In short... this could have been a phenomenal, ground-breaking film.  Instead, it falls flat and rolls over into offensive territory.",1396742400,,1202,5.128865979381444

5581417,1,B00BDANU94,"I heard about this film and looked it up. The premise seemed fascinating and the first thing that came to mind is ""I must watch this"". Anticipating, from the visuals and advertising, this film would be a trippy ride through prison lane. Unfortunately as soon as I started watching, I got the sense of a very sanitized film with actors who I am sure had lots of terms and conditions imposed on the filmmakers prior to diving into making the film. In one word, the film just does not seem authentic. A simple a word as that maybe, it is the lifeblood of films of this type. If you are going to go through the troubles of doing a prison drama, get in there and get your feet wet. The actors skimped on all situations. Not sure if the script was written like that or what happened between the production and final cut. Whatever may have happened in the process, it is obvious many things got chopped and with them the fear and tension that this sort of situation brings about for any straight attorney who would have been wrongly classified in a prison system. The girl that the attorney meets at the beginning is so obviously female, she was miscast in the first place. Nowhere did her performance remotely resemble that of someone who may have been previously male. If you are going to do something like this.. go all the way. Get the real thing. You would never see obviously real women in a K-11 section and that is what spoiled it for me. Sometimes playing it safe can inhibit your film from all of the wonderful possibilities that could have been effective if more time and effort was placed in finding actors who could accurately portray a grim situation successfully in a rather dark place. My suspension of disbelieve got interrupted several times and at every attempt I made to try to immerse myself in the reality of what should have been a very dark, disturbing, spine tingling situation for the viewer. In other words I expected something around the realm of ""OZ"" the very successful cable series that did exemplify the tensions and fears that prison life entail. Sad to say, I felt instead of OZ I got something along the lines of ""the wizard of OZ"" version sprinkled with mild to light tension. Unfortunately, this was a missed opportunity.  1.5/10",1376352000,2,2259,4.5777777777777775
5581418,5,B00BDANU94,"I was disappointed that this film never made it to the mainstream theaters, or even Independants outside the large cities, I was thrilled to see it finally released on DVD.  The film is raw, however Goran Visnjic is amazing and that itself is enough to make the film worth buying.",1374451200,,280,4.6

Special kudos to Kate Del Castillo who plays inmate ""Mousey"" and Portia Doubleday who plays another inmate called ""Butterfly"". Also Goran Visinjic was excellent as the clueless record producer who ends up in cell block K-11 for murder of his rockstar client. (An L.A. cell block for gays and transsexuals, or for anyone who wouldn't survive in the mainstay prison.) Blasted on heroin...he stumbles around in a daze until it wears off, I guess, then he starts thinkin'.

This movie is real and there is sexual violence and drugs...dangerously close to soft-porn and could be considered voyeuristic and and exploitation of the prison population, but for the incredible acting that warms your heart to these basically lost characters; allowing you to walk in their shoes.
