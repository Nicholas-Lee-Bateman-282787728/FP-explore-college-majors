Hala he only has the three fights so i guess i lucked out. The fourth fight between them hadn't materialized yet when he wrote his review. They are both great boxers but i favor and root for Vasquez in this series because of that dynamite left hook. These are great fights and well worth the money. under $10.00 for alot of blood,guts,and glory. all fights are in english with Al Bernstein calling the fights.",1342828800,,556,4.46078431372549
8287758,2,B001CHV4MI,"I'm not going to review the actual fights, because every fight fan knows that the first three fights with Vazquez and Marquez are among the best in boxing history.
My gripe is that I ordered the DVD and when I received it, it was the same DVD cover, the disc itself has the same picture as the cover, but the fights were completely different.  This was what was on the disc I received:
De La Hoya vs. Vargas
Jose Luis Ramirez vs. Edwin Rosario I
Jose Luis Ramirez vs. Edwin Rosario II

Don't get me wrong, those were good fights, but it wasn't what I ordered.

Maybe somebody who ordered it received what they paid for, but I didn't.  Beware.",1286064000,,642,4.325
8287759,5,B001CHV4MI,"As much as I relished the Barrera/Morales grudge matches, I enjoyed the Israel Vazquez/Rafael Marquez trilogy even more. Barrera and Morales, both exquisitely skilled warriors, waged three brilliant wars and it certainly didn't hurt for spice that bad blood brewed between the two. But what carries the Vazquez/Marquez slugfests over the top for me is the sheer power exhibited by these two punchers (and, remember, these are punchers in the 121 pound division). A memorable mess of explosive knockdowns and near knockdowns in their three epic fights. Meanwhile, I remember only one knockdown in the Barrera/Morales affairs, and I don't know that Morales's sole trip to the canvas even counts as the real thing.

Anyway, GRANDES PELEAS Vol. 10 offers all three of the skirmishes between Israel Vazquez and Rafael ""Magnifico"" Marquez. This is a must see DVD if you're at all a fan of the sweet science. Shotime boxing commentator Al Bernstein was heard to say: ""If ever two fighters were made for each other, these two are."" - and Al tells it true. These cats are almost, almost evenly matched. Of the two, Marquez was the more polished boxer, the smoother operator. But Vazquez could also turn into a skilled technician, although he preferred to just clock you with his mighty, mighty left hook. (Rumor has it that it was Vazquez who knocked down Vic Darchinyan in a sparring session - this was when Darchinyan was still touting that aura of invincibility, before Nonito Donaire blasted him with a left hook in their championship bout.)

Rafael Marquez, for a while, was overshadowed by the accomplishments of his older brother Juan Manuel Marquez. But Rafael eventually came into his own, and had become a feared and highly respected fighter by the time he stepped in the ring with Israel Vazquez on March 3, 2007. There was speculation as to whether Marquez, moving up from Bantam to Super Bantam weight, would be able to carry his power. The first round would put that question to rest as Marquez would bloody Vazquez's nose and seriously wobble him with a pinpoint straight right hand. And then came Round 3 and the role reversal as Israel would crack Marquez with his patented left hook. It was a grueling give-and-go from jump, rife with crazy busy work rates and clashing iron wills, and the thing was rapidly taking on this Corrales-Castillo aura, that is, until a broken nose rendered Vazquez unable to come out for Round 8. And, so, Marquez wrested away Magnifico's WBC Super Bantamweight title. But that's only the start of it.

They would fight two more times, on August 4, 2007 and on March 1, 2008. Regarding these rematches, I'll just say that it only gets better and leave you to check them out and be transported to boxing nirvana. I've heard talk of a fourth fight between these two, except that injuries or whatever had gotten in the way. But I hope it happens. When these two guys were trading destructive salvos and taking turns putting the pain on each other, man, I was never more in love with the manly sport of punching people in the face. To quote the guy from Gladiator: ""Are you not entertained?!"" To which I say, ""Heck, yeah!!""",1264032000,,3156,4.797794117647059
