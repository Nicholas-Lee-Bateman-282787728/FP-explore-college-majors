6602771,5,B00MW52KDQ,As the cover depicts..action!  We also ordered The Trilogy set....,1416182400,,66,5.6
6602772,4,B00MW52KDQ,This was an enjoyable series though a little variable in the quality of the episodes with regards plot and not as consistent overall as the earlier trilogy. However some of the episodes were excellent and even the weaker ones compare well to other offerings. Overall well worth a look if you enjoy scandinavian crime drama's with quite a lot of action.,1416096000,,352,4.786885245901639

6602774,5,B00MW52KDQ,"The best European crime series I have seen in years. There's action, there's drama, the stories are gripping. Joel Kinnaman as Frank Wagner does a phenomenal job. I highly recommend it!",1412035200,8,185,5.0

6602777,3,B00MW52KDQ,"while the storylines were quite good, it was;nt gritty enough for me, and jakob ekland looks a big sap; does;nt come across as a tough guy to me.

6602778,5,B00MW52KDQ,Great series. Can't wait for second season to see more. Cops and robbers in another country{Sweden} very finterestering!,1433548800,,120,5.722222222222222
6602779,4,B00MW52KDQ,Good action and plot. Interesting insides into Scandinavian societies.,1432425600,,70,6.888888888888889
6602780,1,B00MW52KDQ,"Just couldn't get into this series. didn't care about the characters, mediocre to poor script/acting",1432339200,,100,5.733333333333333
6602781,4,B00MW52KDQ,Already had the three movies which could be considered as a prequel to Season 1 except for the fact that Season 1 takes place 5 years after where the monies left off. In the movies at the end he is leaving his hometown to go fight crime with INTERPOL(?) but in season one he has returned to his hometown and it is never really clear if he is still a part of the INTERPOL organization or not. Other than that its a pretty good series.,1429401600,2,433,4.105882352941176
6602782,5,B00MW52KDQ,"The Johan Falk series is is full of great action and noticeable tension. Jakob Eklund reminds me a bit of a younger Harrison Ford.
This series is different than many others in that it really moves along, with no weakness's to speak of. It also has great production values.",1426377600,2,272,4.571428571428571
6602783,5,B00MW52KDQ,"I like Swedish crime series.  One of the better series out there.  Good characters, good story lines & well shot.",1424476800,,113,4.6
6602784,5,B00MW52KDQ,"great series, i have an all region free player.  initially just ordered bc joel kinnaman was in the series (whom I adore), however i honestly think he did very well in this and the killing series, snabbacash movies was just poorly written and not believable.  The series focuses on how informants are used and the cop and the informants life which was very interesting and plausible given the storyline with regards to how much money the city gives them (which is hardly anything) for putting their life and reputation at risk, then again the frank wagner character chose the wrong people to hang out with and really pays the consequences of keeping bad company.  It makes a lot of sense, if you take gangs in america sometimes the people who aren't in the actual gang but associated with the gang are actually worse than the gang member because they can get away with more.  I wish joel kinnaman would have",1423180800,3,907,4.65

8674992,5,B00MW52KDQ,I like all the Nordic productions I have viewed on DVD.  But Johan Falk is my favorite - both Season 1 and the Trilogy.,1509753600,,119,3.9583333333333335

8674997,5,B00MW52KDQ,"Watched it on loan from the local library and loved it. Great story lines, fantastic acting, couldn't be better. I just wished I knew that this comes chronologically after the 3-part series (this is called Season 1 but it's actually a sequel to an earlier, 3-movie set. Love Swedish Crime Noir.",1446854400,2,294,4.784313725490196
