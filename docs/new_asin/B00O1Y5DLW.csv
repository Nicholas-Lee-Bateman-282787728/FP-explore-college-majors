8681494,4,B00O1Y5DLW,"Interesting orchestrations of some ""all-time favourites"" easy listening tracks, well played / executed. Kraggerud is certainly talented, although on this record his playing is more emotional than virtuoso - which, for playing Kreisler, is par for the course. The orchestra works well together and blends in perfectly. Annoying only to hear coughs and audience noises across tracks, which is why I am never a big fan of live recordings.",1532304000,,435,5.318840579710145

8681496,5,B00O1Y5DLW,"Sort of an intimate, informal tribute to Fritz Kreisler at Oslo Lodge, in Norway. There are few of the old chestnuts that you would expect, except ""Praeludium and Allegro"" and ""Schoen Rosmarin"", which is played as the last encore. Kragerrud has a special feeling for playing Kreisler, unlike some, who just dash it off. I found myself getting rather teary-eyed at times, and chuckling at other times, when Kragerrud interposed quaint stories from Kreisler's life. The performer plays one of Fritz's later violins, a Carlo Bergonzi from 1745, which has an exceptionally rich, throaty tone. No thin sounding notes here, everything full-bodied, rich. Fritz had a knack for finding fiddles with 'that voice', whether made by an ancient master, or a modern. I thought the acoustics of a lodge would thin the sound out some, but I was surprised. It almost sounded like a studio recording. The audience of about 50 listeners was within touching distance of Kragerrud, and his small string orchestra, who stand near him, giving the event an even more intimate feel. Most of these pieces, if not all, were never written with orchestration, and here is one of the best parts of the show - Kragerrud's young composer/arranger is present in the audience, and is introduced by Henning Kragerrud as the man who filled out the accompaniment for the Oslo Camerata to play. The music he arranged, or composed, fits Kreisler's solos like a pair of gloves. His work was excellent, and one of the wonderful surprises of the event.",1416700800,,1510,4.948818897637795
