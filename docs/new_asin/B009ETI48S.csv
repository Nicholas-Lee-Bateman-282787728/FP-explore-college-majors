8540753,5,B009ETI48S,"This version of the opera sung in French is absolutely amazing and astounding. The libretto was adapted for this stage production and the recitatives have been reduced and replaced by some modern language unsung passages, dialogues most of the time. That probably shortens the opera but it gives to it a tremendous power in its condensed form. The arias and duets are kept of course with the music of course and they explode in quality and force due to the shortened and demusicalized recitatives.

Along with this modernization of the opera to present-day taste the stage production is of course in modern costumes and uses modern visual techniques to build a background referential dcor to what is happening on the stage. Opening sections and other overtures are using vast video projections on a screen and such video moments are used now and then to widen the stage with elements that are either magnified or contextual. The most striking element here is the use of the two children, the two sons. First they are older than they should be because they play an active role in the opera: they even once speak. They are more young teenagers than children.

They open the opera during the overture with a screen projecting videos of Jasons wedding with Medea. They are showing their boredom by more or less falling asleep on the stage. During the first act and the preparations of Jasons new wedding with the local princess, Creons daughter Dirc, the two kids are writing graffiti on the back wall of the stage behind a glass separation. I will not reproduce what they wrote. It is in both English and French and it is gross accusations against Dirc.

All along they are present and active. In the last act they are preparing for their last night with their mother. They are in their underwear before putting on their pajamas. They are extremely active with their mother in a scene that is ambiguous in many ways: Medea is wavering ,between killing or not killing. She finally lets the children go only to run after them later with nthe fatal blade. It is also ambiguous sexually. We can wonder if Medea is not transferring her love for Jason specifically associated to his sperm onto the fruits of this sperm hence the children who are more than half nude and embracing Medea in the most intimate way. The first distance at this level is provided by the covering of this nudity with pajamas.

In this version Creon is reduced to very little singing in spite of a heavy presence on the stage and on the screen. Jason is quite present but is also densified since we only have his arias and not his long recitatives that explained many things that are today beyond any explanation since we know the details. He appears as a real fool as well as a lustful ambition-motivated social climber of some sort. He is trying to recapture his noble position in Greece by marrying a Greek princess, by rejecting his Colchian wife but at the same time trying to keep and recuperate his mixed blood children. He impersonates a very negative character and we are deprived of any sympathy for him, let alone empathy. He is repulsive.

On the other hand Medea is the very embodiment and impersonation of suffering due to an unjust brutality that is imposed onto her by the Greeks who are obviously xenophobic if not plain racist since Medea being from Colchis is from the Old European stock of Turkic language, culture and origin, whereas the Greeks are the new comers of Indo-European origin, culture and language. Though the libretto insists on Medeas betrayed love for Jason as her main motivation, this production with the active role the children play emphasizes her motherly dimension which really makes the final decision a lot more difficult since she has to hurt her children in order to hurt her husband. Her vengeance becomes a vendetta and this is the alienation if not negation of her motherly side?

This production thus tremendously magnifies the deeper meaning of the tragedy the way we can see it with modern eyes. She then can leave the scene, though without any chariot and supernatural horses or dragons. She just steps to the foreground of the stage while the metal security screen comes down and she will exit through the small door on the right that opens onto the back stage for her.

But this music and this poetry (in the arias) is still what they always were and that is definitely the best part of this opera. French is not a tonal language but a syllabic language, meaning there are no stressed syllables, only a certain number of such syllables. The music plays on that dimension of the language by building many arias on half alexandrine lines, hence on units of six feet. But Cherubini then works on the possible variants of this six foot unit that has to ,be cut in two and it becomes most powerful when it is divided in blocks of three syllables. The music can easily emphasize this rhythm and it becomes some kind of hammering and pounding for highly dramatic scenes though it could also be very fluid for more romantic scenes, but there are very few romantic moments in this opera.

Take those instances at the end of the second act:

 Aux larmes  dune mre
 O triste  souvenir ! 

Or again :

 Vainement  de mon cur
 Je veux vous  effacer ! 

But Cherubini is able to vary this 3-3 rhythm with a 4-2 rhythm that sounds cold, distant, cruel like in Medeas last pronunciamento, 4-2 / 3-3:

 Et sur les bords  du Styx
 mon ombre  va tattendre ! 

And Cherubini can even do further and express Medeas condescending hatred with a 2-2-2 rhythm like in:

 Par des  chemins  connus
 Pour moi  toujours  secrets. 

And the last cry from Jason is this time purely inhuman by using a 2-4 rhythm that could maybe be captured as 2-2-2:

 Mes fils  rends-moi mes fils ! 

The last note I will give here is the fact that the main singers are not French natives and the director and probably the conductor chose to have them sing with some accent making them sound unreal like foreigners in that land of hatred. This use of a slight accent now and then is of course remarkable because we feel as if we were in some other land, some other country, some supernatural empire of unethical power-hungry monsters. That gives to Medea a human dimension that is rarely captured the way it should be.

8540754,5,B009ETI48S,"Medee has been described as ""unmitigated horror"" which indeed it is.  Krzysztof Warlikowski, the stage director, and Christian Longchamp rewrote and updated the spoken dialogue of Luigi Cherubini's 1797 opera.  In addition, this version of Medee is set in what appears to be a late 60's and early 70's era with 'punk' as well as modern formal dress.

Nadia Michael as Medee, the ultimate femme fatale, dominates the entire opera, as, of course, she must. She provides an utterly convincing performance of a terrifying woman who quite literally cannot endure rejection. Her rage and baffled fury seem to consume the stage. Kurt Streit as Jason is also convincing in his portrayal of a man who is at once frightened of his wife, and yet almost hypnotically fascinated by her.

Vincent Le Texier as Creon is presented as a kind of gangster/businessman who, though used to power, has no idea what he is up against in his confrontation with Medee. Hendrickje Van Kerckhove as Dirce does a wonderful job portraying the tragic bride who cannot still her forebodings.

Brahms said that Medee is the ""highest peak of dramatic music."" Warlikowski's updated version brilliantly captures this. The video itself helps convey the claustrophobia, dread, and fatalism which pervades the music and the drama. Cherubini's music matches the ferocity of the drama and aids in propelling it toward an end we all know is coming.",1375228800,7,1406,5.043103448275862
8540755,3,B009ETI48S,"I expect to see a production of an opera or a play that is an accurate representation of what the writer/composer wrote. To alter his work, and to present it, even with a notice that it's been updated, is, to my mind, a species of a fraud. It's even worse when I'm encountering something for the first time, and have no idea what the original is supposed to be like. In this case the original libretto has been updated so that while the arias remain intact the recitative has been changed, or updated, so that Medea now says things like she wants Jason's sperm. Huh? Surely that wasn't in the 1797 text. Further the production has been moved out of either 1797 AD period, which would be acceptable given that plays and operas were frequently staged with contemporary costuming during the period of Cherubini's life, or the Bronze age period when the events would have occurred, and put into the modern era. So there's 1 star deduction for that.

There's some action that seems silly. Dirce wakes up, apparently after a wild party, face down and topless. There's some business with putting a bra and undergarments on her. Medea, in another scene, comes in with tattoos, and looking a bit like Amy Winehouse. The Winehouse do is eventually revealed to be a wig, and there's some business later on with Medea putting on a blonde wig. Why the wig nonsense? God, and the director, may know, but I sure don't. The most notable deficiency, however, is what has to be either carelessness and incompetence, or a deliberate destruction of any illusion the audience might have. The singers have clearly noticeable mics on their faces. In some cases you can see the transmitters/battery packs on their backs. This completely destroys any feeling that you're witnessing something other than a stage performance. Is this supposed to be Brechtian alienation? Well, I don't care all that much for Brecht, and I didn't care for seeing the mics either. So there's another star knocked off for all of this.

Musically the production was quite good. Nadja Michael is very good as Medea, as is Kurt Streit as Jason. The girl playing Dirce is fetching. Musically, as far as I can judge, and I admit I'm not the best judge for many things, like whether the tempo is too fast or too slow, or the soprano hit the note right, the production seemed quite good. The main failing was in the visual aspect, which, after all, is what you buy a Blu-Ray for.",1366502400,14,2425,4.663551401869159
