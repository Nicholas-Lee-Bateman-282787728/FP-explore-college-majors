2874849,5,B000RTBDV4,"No disappointments with the second series of Big Love. Please hurry up with number three. The character development is never boring, the dialogue is crisp and the plot is riviting.",1200009600,4,180,5.033333333333333
2874850,5,B000RTBDV4,"We loved HBO's Big Love Season 1, so we couldn't wait to get its second season, and hooray, it became available last month.  Season 2 is just as entertaining as Season 1.  The main character is Mormon and a polygamist with three wives and children by each of them.  In the series, this lifestyle is portrayed as fairly complicated, sometimes funny, and sometimes sad, but always interesting. I read somewhere that some Mormons had concerns about the show, but in my opinion, the series neither glorifies or condemns the practice; although it does portray this family as more mainstream than those polygamist families living on the ""compound.""",1199664000,4,642,4.981308411214953
2874851,5,B000RTBDV4,"Can't go wrong buying the second season of this HBO hit show.  I have both seasons and watch them over and over.  Gives many hours of viewing pleasure.  Great qulity DVD's nice boxed set.  BTW, BEST price on thi set anywhere even if you had soupons elsewhere. Sells for far more on HBO website!!",1198800000,2,295,4.407407407407407
2874852,5,B000RTBDV4,"SPOILERS!!  In the second season of this unique series, things get even more complicated and difficult for polygamist husband Bill Henrikson and his three wives, Barb, Nikki, and Margene.  Their oldest son is tempted carnally and then turns to the polygamy principle for sustenance, the oldest girl goes the opposite direction, Bill considers a fourth wife, Margene wants to be a surrogate mother, Nikki's family makes things dangerous for the Henriksons, one of Roman's intended young brides blackmails some of the Henriksons, and Bill wants to expand his financial empire to include video game slot machines.
What's most fascinating about this series  is that the family is portrayed as struggling to live in the modern suburbs, outside of the compounds that most polygamists these days might live in; and that they have tried to hide their lifestyle from many people.  However, one can only hide such a thing for so long.  Imagine how it would be having four partners in a marriage, seven kids among you, and three neighboring houses to coordinate, as well as a high-profile home improvement business.
The cast is spot-on, especially the temperamental and conflicted second wife, played by Chloe Sevigny; and the stalwart Harry Dean Stanton as her father, the powerful patriarch who believes himself to be a prophet.",1198368000,15,1319,5.144859813084112
2874853,5,B000RTBDV4,"I love this show! I really got a kick out of the first season and the second was even better. The wives are a delightful mixture of devils and angels. The second season is a bit more risque in that the sexual scenes are much more graphic. Definately not for children. As a member of the LDS Church that does not condone polygamy, I was at first interested in the show because I wanted to see how it portrayed the Mormon Church. But it really skirts the issue although there are subtle inuendo like LDS Church icons and landmarks in scenes of the show.
  I love the way the wives interact with each other but most of all,  love how they gang up on Bill or turn on him to get what they want.
  The twists and turns with members of the sect at the compound and the power struggle between the two ""prophet"" heir families is interesting. Also bringing in another Polygimist sect ""the Greens"" was a completely new twist which I think we will see much more of in future episodes.
Overall it is a great show and I have my DVR set to watch or record each episode.
Thanks
Kate",1195862400,35,1066,4.231527093596059

The cast was superb.
I resisted watching Big Love because of the subject material. What an idiot I was.

You have to be in touch with your feminine side to really appreciate the show because it is heavily about relationships, etc. This is not a pure slam on polygamy or morman religion. It is a slam on morman compounds which is not normal for morman people. There is some attempt to show the other side to polygamy.

2875030,5,B000RTBDV4,"I am currently REwatching this series (all 5 seasons) for the 5th time since the show started.

Super bumbed out that this show got cancelled.

When I try to tell friends about the show, I get withering looks and marked disinterest because of the subject matter. What a shame.
People REFUSE to watch the show because they think ( no matter what you tell them ) that it promotes Mormonism and or polygamy.

IT DOESNT . The show illustrates the different stratas of polygamy, the people who are living ( and some escaping it ) and how it all works.

I've been an Athiest for 35 years, and I LOVE this show.

I really love the opening credits and song HOME which was introduced at the end of season 3 ( I think). My gosh, what a beautiful, instructive and wonderful illustration of what "" The Principle"" means to these people.

GREAT ACTING by all the cast.",1440288000,,854,4.407643312101911

It seemed that the writers were trying to throw a myriad of social issues into one season ie: surrogacy, homosexuality,pedophilia ,compulsive behavior , courting the fourth wife etc. None of the issues seemed to have closure, therefore the season seemed choppy.",1427328000,,319,5.2745098039215685

The family is trying to live ""The Principle"" though white lies, deceit, and deception are common occurrences.  Some of the kids embrace their life while others are looking to break from it.  The Book of Mormon is mentioned but this family is a break away from the LDS.  The LDS families in the show are depicted as intolerant of plural marriage and slightly nutty.  Having known a LDS High Priest I'd say the series is a blast but is far from an honest portrayal of LDS members who are imperfect in various ways like everyone else.",1415059200,,640,4.530434782608696

The second season was arguably one of the best seasons of ""Big Love""!  These DVDs are great!

My only complaint is that there aren't very many special features, and the subtitles rarely show the lyrics to songs that are sung on-screen (including the opening themes, which is ""God Only Knows"", by The Beach Boys).

2875346,3,B000RTBDV4,"OK, so there is the gig.  This show is all about apostate Mormons who leave the LDS church to follow some fictional polygamist group.  Actually, two of the cast were raised in ""the compound"" of said poly group, one was raised LDS and the other ... we have not really learned where she came from, but not from anything related to LDS.  The show loves to portray a really negative light on the LDS church which goes beyond the normal bias polygamists have against LDS folk.  The show likes to poke fun at religion in general and really can be quite sacrilegious at times.

They love to drop ""LDS-Speak"" on the viewers, who if not LDS would not get the references at all.  Are they targeting LDS people as watchers of this show??  The LDS church as come out quite critically of the crude nature of the content of this production.  So I am guessing few LDS watch.  Seems the writers could have greatly benefited by having an actual Mormon help as a technical consultant.  My best guess is that they used an ex-Mormon who never really understood their beliefs in the first place.

Big Love is full of gratuitous sex ... which is likely to be a BIG PART of what people are curious about, regarding polygamist families.  I imagine many are still looking for all 4 of them in bed together.  That would have ended all credibility in an already somewhat incredulous show.  Thanks producers ... for sparing us that, at least.

Now ... with all of that negativity out of the way ... BIG LOVE is honestly fascinating when it comes to viewing the interpersonal relationships between the members of this family, both husband and wives, wives and wives, wives and the various kids, and relationships with outsiders and friends.  What a complicated world these folks (in real life poly families) must live.

I could not do it.  One wife is easily enough work for this guy.

Special kudos go out to Chloe Sevigny for her role as Nickie...the deeply indoctrinated daughter of the polygamist sect leader, and 2nd wife in the plural marriage of the Big Love family.  Her character is really complicated, conniving, OCD, bitchy, passionate, and totally conflicted.  It is always a treat to see what she is going to do next.

It is a show worth watching ... but don't take anything they say regarding any religion too seriously.  They really just don't get it!",1404691200,,2337,4.618932038834951

2875361,5,B000RTBDV4,"As I wrote in my review of Season 1, the entire Big Love catalog is classic! Superb writing, even better acting, compelling, jarring, shocking and filled with moments of pure tenderness that just grab you by the heartstrings and lull you in. In this season, episode 6 is my favorite. Bill is dating Ana and Margene has become friends with Ana. Around the 18-minute mark of episode 6 Margene goes to Ana's apartment and the two converse about love and Margene comes clean, telling Ana that she is a polygamist.

This one scene is SO captivating, so perfectly executed, so brilliant in its subtlety that it literally takes my breath away every time that I watch it. When Margene tells Ana about her ""status,"" Ana has a look of shock and says: ""No."" Margene takes a second or two to answer and when she does, quietly saying: ""Yes,"" it is Ginnifer Goodwin showing her talents as an actress as being at the top of their game. It is pure brilliance!

The entire season - like the entire series - is just complete perfection. As I stated prior, if you missed this when it was on HBO, do yourself a huge favor and watch it now, from beginning to end. You'll be surprised by how completely mesmerizing this series is and you will find yourself totally riveted to your television.",1403568000,,1270,4.541484716157205

Still, lots of fun.",1403395200,,296,6.375

2875367,3,B000RTBDV4,"I was a huge fan of Season 1 - Loved the characters, the premise, thought it was very well written, and well acted as well.  It was fascinating to examine all of the issues that arise out of a polygamous marriage - the relationships among the three ""sister wives"" and their relationship with a husband who truly seems to be in love with and committed to them. To grapple with that seeming contradiction is not just entertaining, but thought-provoking.  To me, the heart and soul of the show is that dynamic.

My problem with Season 2 is that it seems to have gotten a bit unfocused.  Too many little plot lines branching out away from the main story.  There is a lot of - what I consider, anyway - gratuitous sexual content that could easily be alluded to without such graphic depictions.  There is a lot of social commentary about life on the ""compound"" which is ruled by a cruel and demented ""prophet"" who sanctions women - sometimes very young girls - being ""given"" to much older men.  There is a lot more attention given to the very unsavory characters of the prophet's son, Alby, and the parents of the main character, Bill.  These characters appear two-dimensional.  And I fear there may be some stereotyping going on here.  And my biggest problem with Season 2 is that Bill, who is at the heart of the story, seems to be completely driven by his vendetta against Roman Grant (the ""prophet"" and his second wife's father.)  He takes terrible chances with the safety of his family, to say nothing of their emotional well-being.  He appears to be becoming as ruthless as his father-in-law.  He is making his daughter, almost an adult herself, miserable.  If I'm going to be spending so much time with these characters, I really want to like them!  Yes, every hero must fall - but not irredeemably.

Is it still engaging?  Yes, of course.  But not as compelling as it was in Season 1.  I'm hoping Season 3 is better.  I'm hoping for redemption.",1403136000,,1946,4.585507246376811
2875368,5,B000RTBDV4,"This is season two, featuring a continuation of the story line from season one, with some additional story added.

Bill is constantly justifying his decisions & behavior while vilifying everyone else, but he is just as bad, if not worse.

2875379,5,B000RTBDV4,"Life gets messy for Bill and his 3 wives in the second season. There is a lot of drama and betrayal involving the shady and colorful extended family members from the Juniper Creek Compound. It seems that a lot of TV series tend to up the ante each season to higher levels of chaos and mayhem, so Big Love is no exception. So, whereas the first season was reminiscent of Ozzie and Harriett, the second season seems more like the Hatfields and the McCoys. The writing and acting are consistently superb, and the all star cast  is pure joy to watch.

The show takes place in the present time, but there are a lot of unusual musical oldies popping up that produce a weird sense of timelessness and a connection to the past.  One  word of warning If you're binge watching and you're prone to earworms. The theme song  ""God Only Knows"" by the Beach Boys is a very catchy tune and after 2 seasons the song is playing in my head constantly.",1402185600,,932,4.364161849710983

The Executive Producer is a man who is married to another man! Not surprising.
Blatant confusion. If you think that there's nothing strange about that, well, you probably voted for the Muslim president who is crapping down the throat of America.

The emotional impact that polygamy has on the family, the kids especially, as well as Barb, coming from a long standing Mormon family, was played really well.  What impressed me with this show is that it could easily have fallen into the trap of trying to make Polygamy like the right way, and that the choices made for the family was the right one.  The really doesn't do that, and prefers to show the impact and effect of such a lifestyle, without simply bashing it.

2875417,5,B000RTBDV4,"In Season Two of Big Love, the Henrickson family finds that the challenges of being one, big, polygamous family is just beginning.

Season One of the show leaves off with Barb - Bill's first wife - not winning the mother of the year award, Margie (Margene) discovering that she is pregnant, and Roman Grant (leader of the polygamous compound at Juniper Creek) being seriously wounded. But Season One turns out to be child's play in comparison with the events of Season Two.

In Season Two, Nikki (Nicolette) - Bill's second wife - is more manipulative than ever, leaving the audience wondering just how far she'll go to become first wife. Bill, who for all of his faults appears to be a decent person in Season One, also becomes more deceptive (both at home and in his business dealings) as he secretly courts a woman that he considers for a fourth wife and wrests a gambling company named Weber Gaming away from two polygamous factions.

The political intrigue surrounding Juniper Creek and the Grant family also becomes more pronounced in Season Two, with many unexpected twists from characters such as Alby Grant (Nikki's brother), and Adaleen Grant, Nikki's biological mother.

The most notable difference between Season One and Season Two however is the focus on how the Henrickson's secret life of polygamy affects Barb and Bill's two oldest children, Ben and Sarah. Sarah, the Henrickson's oldest child, becomes resentful of her parent's choice as the season progresses and takes action in the last episode of the season to ensure that she never makes the same choice as her parents. In contrast, Ben, (now sixteen in Season Two) begins to romanticize the idea of leading a polygamous life like his father. He ends his relationship with his girlfriend and beings to court two girls (twin sisters) from the compound at Juniper Creek.

With each event that unfolds in Season Two, Big Love fights past being just entertainment and tackles the hard questions of polygamy and the LDS fundamentalist lifestyle.

The bottom line is that Season Two of Big Love does not disappoint; there is no adequate way to express how tastefully, artfully, and successfully the staff of Big Love portrays what is considered difficult subject matter. Each event that unfolds in Season Two of Big Love fights past being just entertainment and tackles the hard questions of polygamy and the LDS fundamentalist lifestyle.

While some individuals may find certain aspects of Big Love offensive, I hope that people will be willing to look past something that might make them uncomfortable to an experience that is both entertaining and highly enlightening. It is especially a must-see series for anyone who is interested in shows that deal with religion or the psychology of cults.",1223769600,7,2761,4.989130434782608

2875419,5,B000RTBDV4,This show is a very interesting drama... Its a lot like Desperate Housewives except that they are all married to the same man.  Creative writing and interesting plots.  I am looking forward to the next season!!,1215820800,,210,4.805555555555555
2875420,4,B000RTBDV4,"Great intrigue as Bill's perfect world starts to fray at the edges. Nicky, surely the least likeable wife, wrangles with her money demons. Barb renews her attempts to placate and mediate impossible situations for love of Bill and Margene makes efforts go her own way.

The threats hinted at in series one emerge powerfully in this series because it was too good to be true. Veterans of series 1 knew that and the narratives which drive series 2 will please them. Bill's oldest children have to find ways to deal with their weird family which adds an extra level of intelligence to the script.",1215302400,,592,4.6923076923076925

Sarah is against the principle, and joins a support group for ex-Mormons. Ben decides to embrace the principle whole-heartedly, and begins dating homely identical twins who wish to marry a 'righteous man' such as he. Barb, Nicki and Margene all get more screen time this season, with Bill figuring in when there's a business deal or something is amuck at the compound.

The climax of the season is when Roman is shot by a rival polygamist family (the Greens) and Bill very nearly gets voted to be prophet-in-waiting until Roman dies. Instead, the unstable and dangerous Alby begins taking over well before his father is ready to go. The relationship between sibling-rivals Alby and Nicki is fascinating, one which I hope the writers develop further next season.

There is no let-down in Season 2. The acting, writing and pacing have a cinematic quality to them, not unlike other HBO series. Watch out for Nicki's emerging gambling addiction, Ben leaving the family for an 'alternative' (i.e. nonpolygamous) lifestyle pushed by his mother and the possibility of Bill bringing a fourth wife. Season 3 has been delayed due to the writers' strike.",1213315200,,1419,5.688679245283019

fantastic, humorous,sad and exciting in places. Every bit as good as the first.
All about Bill Henrikson and his 3 wives and their children trying to fit in to normal suburban life and also live their lives as polygamists.
Look forward to season three on dvd.",1212710400,3,331,4.442622950819672

8202474,5,B000RTBDV4,"Having studied the LDS religion/movement for a number of years and read dozens of books, I believe this show to be both truth and fiction.  Mormons will scorn it because of their beliefs but ex-mormons will be grinning and nodding their  heads in agreement.  Mormons are a hard sell on anything outside their  restricted beliefs.  If you want to defend it that's fine but don't ridicule others who can see through the teachings and practices of the religion. I love the Mormons and would love to help them see there are other religions and yes they are different from Mormons.  I know lots of ex-Mormons and they are the salt of the earth.  They are free and can look at Christians in a true Christian light.  Many Mormon church teach that their members can't attend Christian churches.  Why?",1521936000,,792,4.681159420289855

It's like the Kar-trash-ians got a hold of the women and injected butt fat into their lips for them.

8202478,5,B000RTBDV4,"Season one proved Big Love one of the best shows on TV.  Season two Big Love is even better, and so much BIGGER in every way! The already large cast has multiplied, all rolls filled by some some of the brightest and best on TV.  There is so much drama and so many different sub stories that you almost need to take notes to keep up. And yet it all works out, as beautifully woven together as a fresh dewy spiderweb in the garden.  That said, I loved seeing a woman putting on her own roof, and seeing her mother cutting up a whole hog with a power saw!  These women are not just sex objects.  In an artificially altered society where the women far outnumber the men these women become the worker bees,  amazons capable of incredible things.  Consider this unexpected view of polygamous women a preview of season two which is NOT a simple continuation of last season. It is so much more, so much BIGGER in every way, with  soooo many surprises.",1507161600,,943,4.348571428571429
