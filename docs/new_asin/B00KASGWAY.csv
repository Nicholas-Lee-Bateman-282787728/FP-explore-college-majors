Everything is in Japanese of course,but it shouldn't matter at all since it's a rare and 100% original item. A MUST HAVE for any sekaiichi fan around the world",1497657600,,310,4.7592592592592595

8656989,3,B00KASGWAY,"I like it but it is not the same as the actual anime it self, it focuses on what happens to Yokozawa Takafumi after masamune takano tells him he will never be in love with him. but it does have a quick 10 minuet showing of the other characters though it is not much of a story line for me. this is still a good movie but im not interested in Yokozawa personal life so this movie with him as the main character is not for me, unless they showed more of  ritsu onodera and masamune takano i love them =)",1426032000,,501,3.9603960396039604
