7872733,3,6304479743,"""Harum Scarum"" is considered, by popular opinion to be Elvis' worst film. Don't try to restrain yourself yet. Watch it once, and see what you think. Elvis is an actor who is sent to Arabia and captured. He is trying to be put into the situation to kill the Arabian king. Elvis romances Mary Ann Mobley and turns against his captors and saves the king. Lot of action. Looks like a big budget film, but it's not. Sam Katzman, who had a reputation in Hollywood for producing films on very short schedules and given the nickname ""king of the quickies"", borrowed most of the costumes and sets from previously made films that were in the can. The schedule was only 18 days of shooting. Sounds corny, cheap, and cheesy, but that's what pop stars had to deal with in films they didn't like. Pop stars got the poorest film treatment. Again it is not Elvis' best film, but try it. If you don't like it, forget it.",1036800000,3,903,4.413173652694611
7872734,1,6304479743,"This is the wrost Elvis Presley film I saw. In fact, I don't know why it was even made. In fact, this movie needs zero stars. But ... won't go that far.
You have to wonder why Elvis Presley stars in this hoo-hum movie. Johnny Tyronne (Elvis Presley) is a American actor who gets kidnapped.
When the movie begins, we see Johnny watching a movie (with him in it.) While his missing, he meets a princess (Mary Ann Mobley). Andybody who likes this movie, he/she needs to get thier eyes checked.
Johnny is hired to kill the king (Philip Reed). Which he ends up behind bars, singing So Close But Yet So Far. Is this how Colonel Tom Parker wanted people to remember Elvis Presley like this after he is dead.
I guess so. Why would anybody want to see a movie with an American actor-singer star gets kiddnapped?
Elvis should have said ""NO"" when he was asked to be in this movie.
Songs include, Golden Coins, Harem Holiday, Shake That Tamborine, and So Close But Yet So Far.",985564800,3,964,4.391061452513966
7872735,1,6304479743,"This picture is real hard to sit through.
Elvis plays an American film star (ironic, indeed) that gets kidnapped by Arabians. Of course he falls in love with one of the ladies, but a conflict occurs when he is ordered to  kill her father. Huh?
Anyway, both the plot and the accompanying songs  are weak. The only song that comes close to being good is ""So Close,  Yet So Far"". The others range from the average Elvis movie song  (""Mirage"", ""Hey, Little Girl"") to the ridiculous  (""Shake That Tambourine"").
This is a picture that should have  never seen the light of day, and is not good for those who already have a  negative image of Elvis Presley. For die-hards only!",960768000,5,669,4.525
7872736,1,6304479743,"I've seen all of Elvis' movies, and this is one of the worst three (Stay Away Joe and Double Trouble being the other two).  If I had to pick one worst, this would be it.",958262400,2,169,3.8285714285714287
7872737,2,6304479743,"Entertainment, much as beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. No doubt the steadfast loyalty of dedicated Elvis fans will find value in this movie. Casting Elvis Presley in a spoof of Rudolph Valentino movies was unfortunate. This could be the film that left Elvis crying in the chapel, and it leaves the viewer indescribably blue. Good sense notwithstanding the film was made. That's when your heartaches begin. One could give some credit for attempting a different approach from Elvis' usual ""fun in the sun"" formula film, but the end result lacks charm. Describing the plot is pointless. The music is the '60s pop fluff that Elvis and the songwriters phoned in. It adds to one's reflective midlife melancholy to remember that in 1965, while Elvis' formidable talent was squandered in cheesy movies, the Beatles were leading the charge of the British Invasion; storming the ramparts and taking no prisoners in the realm of rock music and innovative style. Elvis, you left us much too soon. You really deserved better, and so do we. Return to sender. ;-)",951436800,2,1055,4.899441340782123
7872738,1,6304479743,"I was recently on a quest to find the worst Elvis movie, and this is surely it. According to Peter Guralnick's ""Careless Love"" (the best bio of Elvis yet written), even the Colonel was flabbergasted at how  badly this one turned out. The film makes no sense, the acting and songs  are worse than usual, and when its all over, you just feel depressed and  ashamed. Though not as technically flawed as an Ed Wood movie, its at about  the same artistic level.",949276800,,456,4.457831325301205
7872739,1,6304479743,"An unfunny, and flat, effort to style Elvis as a Valentino-Errol Flynn romantic hero, badly written and looking shoddy with sterile backlots filling in for Arabian-type scenery. Features only one worthwhile song,  ""So Close Yet So Far"", while the best track, ""Animal  Instinct"" was left out (although appearing as a 'bonus song' on the  soundtrack album).
After inane material such as this, John Lennon's quip  that Elvis ""died in the Army"" is hauntingly accurate, in a  figurative sense.",939254400,,488,5.205128205128205
