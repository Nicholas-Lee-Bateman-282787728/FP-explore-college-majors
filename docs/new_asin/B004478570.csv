4260274,5,B004478570,"WHY is everyone complaining about what they give you. It's a great horror film with brains, laughs, and plenty of blood and lots of attitude. People shouldn't complain its their fault. They should of read the product info first before purchasing. Even though it didn't come with any special features its still a really good, Awesome slasher movie that is everything people want in a thriller!!! Take advice from someone who knows scary movies this is a smart horror-thriller that everyone should be happy with. So stop complaining and give it credit for what its for a Good, Teen-slasher with style!!!

I Give it a 5/5, I LOVED IT!!!",1293235200,2,633,4.807339449541284
4260275,3,B004478570,this movie doesnt mention it has subtitles so thats disappointing... It had subtitles on t.v. earlier and it was good but for dvd... its sad.,1291161600,,141,4.68
4260276,1,B004478570,"Sorry, but it's inexcusable that MTV sells this release for virtually the same price as an official DVD when all you're getting is a movie burned on a recordable DVD. That's a disgusting and blatant scam.

I'll buy this movie and part 2 when they are actually released with some sort of quality worthy of the price tag.",1288915200,2,319,4.5
4260277,5,B004478570,I saw this when it first aired on MTV and I knew I would buy it when I had the chance. I now have all three movies.,1388448000,,115,3.2962962962962963
4260278,5,B004478570,"I was searching for a new slasher movie to watch so I did a google search and MSPS16 came up. With a title like that a was curious to watch so I ordered it and I loved it! It's a fun, scary & it had more gore than recent PG-13 'horror' movies. Don't let the name fool you. The DVD quality is good, the commercial ques however get annoying. It contains no special features' your only option on the disc menu is 'Play Movie' I wanted to wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray but Im still happy I got it.",1383523200,,498,3.892156862745098

4260280,1,B004478570,"This is yet by far the worse thing that could happen. Got this movie on Saturday and put it in my dvd player and it said ""disc not found nor read"". How disappointing i will never buy from Amazon again this is just a scam to get peoples money what a shame. Just returned it yesterday , I'll be waiting for my money, once again Amazon has failed yet again. What a shame.",1349136000,,368,4.054794520547945
4260281,3,B004478570,"Just got my copy of MSPS16 (along with the sequels!) on DVD. This review is for the DVD, not the movie (which is great). I was a bit worried that because of the format, this movie would lack in quality. I was surprised to find that the quality is just as good as it was back on October 23rd, 2009 when I caught the flick on TV, but it's nothing worth raving about. Another good bonus was that it's the uncut version, though I was disapointed to find that this version has the commercial cues unlike the iTunes version. It is what it is. If you can afford it, then I reccomend getting the DVD, especially because the movie itself is great.",1344988800,,638,4.237704918032787
4260282,5,B004478570,I love this movie and so what if its a DVD-R i'm so happy with it now i wanna buy part 2 & 3 the 3rd one was awesome i want all of em but i wish they had em on BLU-RAY  but i'm happy i got this on DVD i'm so getting part 2 & 3 :),1331769600,,229,2.9482758620689653

4260284,5,B004478570,"For an MTV Movie that was originally aired on television, it's pretty great...
I original bought a digital copy of the movie on iTunes for $4 and it was great! I loved it and then I just had to buy it on DVD. I bought and I love it! I watched it three times the first week I had it.

Now onto the DVD-R ""issue"" its actually not that bad -- I watched it on a blu-ray player on a HDTV and it looked great! High Recommended",1315872000,,420,3.8275862068965516
4260285,5,B004478570,"I saw 'My Super Psycho Sweet 16' on a non-commercial free MTV presentation and spent a couple of years trying to contact the company and had no response.  I finally met someone at a the Video Shop in Santa Barbara, CA who informed me that Amazon.com has a large quality selection of movies.  I went on-line immediately to find my search was finally over and for such a good buy.  The brand new quality is excellent and now I can enjoy the DVD movie I love all the time and without commercial interruptions.  This movie only gets better! The quality and sound are perfect. Thank you!",1306368000,,582,4.462264150943396
4260286,5,B004478570,I purchased this dvd for my step sister for christmas .... only to find out this was the only website that I was able to even find a copy of the movie at... after reading all the other reviews I was a little worried but I tried it out anyway and she loves it! !

8415955,4,B004478570,"I have to admit that our friends at MTV get the movie thing right 90% of the time. This is a fun goodie. Don't expect any deep mystery, if you don't figure out who is doing it immediately, go back to detective school. You have your deranged killer and, of course, your standard characters. The girl who is too good for everyone else and her hangers on, her handsome boyfriend who is done with her and wants the loner girl and lover girls best boy bud. Rather violent forms of killings, so if that is a problem for you...stay away. Beatings, stabbings, bludgeonings etc.  Not for the younger kids.",1416182400,,596,4.467889908256881
