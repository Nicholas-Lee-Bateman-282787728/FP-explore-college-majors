2704780,5,B000LC3IT2,"This is a fun little video, sadly only going for one hour. However, it is very amusing to say the least. Even though the majority of his cars that he considers will go to heaven are cars the majority of people will not be able to afford, you still get a video his thrashing em about. Giving you dreams of you doing that to them. I do recommend this video, its entertaining Jeremy Clarkson style.",1196640000,5,395,4.28
2704781,4,B000LC3IT2,"For a devoted fan of Top Gear this DVD is a nice filler for the time between episodes.  However, watching this DVD reminds me of just how great the show is.  This DVD is a good time but I really found myself missing Hammond and May and all of the other elements (the news, the star in the reasonably priced car, the cool wall, etc.) that keep an episode of Top Gear moving and visually interesting.  This DVD is mostly Clarkson doing powerslides in really nice cars, punctuated by the occasional bad deed done to an even worse car.  And while this is fun, it gets a little monotonous.  Its hard to watch it all in one sitting and its even harder to watch it more than once.  The production quality is very good, even if in a few places the background music is little cheesy.  Most importantly however, Jeremy Clarkson is at his impish, opinionated, gregarious, obnoxious best, and that is what makes this DVD worthwhile.",1195862400,17,920,4.473053892215569

2704783,4,B000LC3IT2,"Well, this a really good thing very ""top gearish"" but somehow I just don't get to love it, just like it. It's a shame that it only lasts an hour or so but don't worry, it's worth every penny.",1178150400,3,191,3.923076923076923
2704784,4,B000LC3IT2,"really a good thing to watch, especially if you are a petrol head; awesome cars and great reviews and info with Jeremy's usual witty manner; glad to see the Stig doing his thing and loved the destruction of the useless things on four wheels; just missed the Hamster and Capt Slow giving Clarkson his much needed ribbing",1175212800,15,319,4.614035087719298
2704795,5,B000LC3IT2,"This is one of the greatest Clarkson's performances! I have always been a huge Top Gear fan, and I've seen this mad man become the legend that he is. This dvd is absolute insanity and the greatest thing is that as the days go by, while on the road, I remember his insights and laugh alone, because he is so right! (If you watch this dvd, you'll remember a few lines he says while test driving a Chinese miniature car). Please watch it! i promise it is FUN!",1286496000,,456,4.193181818181818
2704796,4,B000LC3IT2,"As the title says, though Jeremy Clarkson is alone, it feels 90% like an old epiosde of Top Gear.

It has all the elements of it (with the exception of Cpt. Slow & Hammond) Jeremy's usual attitude/character when talking about cars, Jeremy tearing around a closed runway track, little interesting demos and situations, and of course the stig arriving in dramatic fashion to give the cars a real workout.

This is a must for any fan of Top Gear, and especially any fan in the US, since as far as I can tell, there don't seem to be many Jeremy Clarkson DVD's in region 1 format.",1265846400,,575,4.415094339622642
2704797,5,B000LC3IT2,"Clarkson's ""Heaven an Hell"" is brilliant in the fact that it is Clarkson doing what he does best. Fans of Top Gear will not be dissapointed from his remarks of driving a Ferrari Enzo to his absolute disdain of the Citron. Beware his wrath if any car dissapoints this man he will make sure that the car and its manufactures learn a lesson.
Very entertaining and a great addition to ""Top Gear"".",1262908800,,392,4.458333333333333
2704798,3,B000LC3IT2,"As a long time Clarkson fan I was looking forward to sitting down and spending some time with this DVD but I was sadly disappointed.

Part of the problem is that with the advent of production cars such as the Veyron and Koenigsegg, the ""Heaven"" cars on this agenda are just not as impressive as they would have been when the show was first produced. Top speeds of 170 and 180 are just plain ""meh"" when - with a fat wallet - one can have a car with over 1000bhp, reaches 60mph in under 3 seconds and tops 250 on the open road. Since Clarkson is demonstrating cars he approves of, and all are similar performance cars, the ""Heaven"" sequences become formulaic and, dare I say it, even slightly boring.

The ""Hell"" segments are shorter and for the most part there is limited valid explanation as to why they are so bad; one gets the impression they are simply cars that Clarkson himself doesn't like. More than anything, they seem to be segues into the next ""Heaven"" sequence, rather like the articles about subjects like geography and airplanes which appear in porn magazines. Most of the highlights are in the ""Hell"" chapters such as the jousting tournament between the TR& and the Ford Scorpio, which deserves to be a staple event at demolition derbies worldwide, and the explosive demolition of the nasty little Kelisa.

Personally I would enjoy seeing Clarkson doing an entire show on terrible cars, why they are terrible, and creative and terrible ways to destroy them. ""Heaven and Hell"" is worth a watch but doesn't stand up to repeated viewing, unless you are a performance car marque junkie.",1258761600,2,1596,4.672597864768683
2704799,4,B000LC3IT2,"Typical Clarkson pretty much testing all the best cars for the 2004 season of Top Gear. I love this guy, he never siezes to make me laugh and seeing some of the stunts are pretty impressive. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have seen every episode of Top Gear and some of the cars/junky cars they tested they also did in the show.",1236988800,,351,4.101449275362318
2704800,5,B000LC3IT2,"I really love the BBC show Top Gear.  This DVD is a special the Clarkson made outside the series.  I was really looking for a DVD of the Top Gear series.  This was a good substitute as the jocularity and insight was spot on.  I love that they call out manufacturers of terrible unimaginative cars and then find ways to destroy them.. Then there is the heaven part where they praise and review supercars.  What is really neat is they way the drive them all out.

BBC... I am still waiting for my Top Gear series DVD sets.  So please get on it!!",1232841600,,543,4.213592233009709
2704801,5,B000LC3IT2,"Any one that is a car/motor head fan they will love this video.

2704803,4,B000LC3IT2,"Clarkson drives some fine and atrocious cars in this DVD. The good include truly sublime rides, the bad are just ridiculous. This is great entertainment & strongly recommended. Good fun.

2704804,3,B000LC3IT2,"True gearheads will adore this video, but fans of Top Gear whose interest in cars is at best casual will long for more. The fun thing about Top Gear isn't the cars spinning around the track, it's the interaction of three chronically mismatched personalities with only one shared passion- automobiles. This video has only Jeremy Clarkson (with brief appearances by The Stig), and the lack of any real challenging viewpoint, much less the lunatic interaction of Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May we're used to, hurts badly.

To make things worse, this series of car reviews is leavened by far too brief bits on the ""hell"" cars, the vehicles Clarkson regards as an affront to driving. Of course, the ""heaven and hell"" theme is tenuous at best: all the ""heaven"" cars, with one exception, come from a single model year (2005); none of the ""hell"" cars, with the exception of one bought straight off the lot, is younger than five. All of the ""heaven"" cars have big ""shouty"" engines, sporty handling, and high top speeds; only one ""hell"" car might have had a shouty engine in the 1970s when it was made. Even the terms ""heaven and hell"" are references seldom, with stream-of-consciousness threading threatening to remove this reviewer's consciousness.

Top Gear fans- rent, and enjoy... but only buy if you're a true gearhead who doesn't mind seeing cars rushing by again, again, again, again, again, again, again...",1219795200,2,1414,4.936974789915967
2704815,4,B000LC3IT2,"While the Heaven portions of the DVD were just that...the demolition of innocent cars was a bit disturbing in a Monty Python sort of way...

I love Top Gear and Jeremy never lets me down when I need a laugh or an ""oooh"" at some amazing piece of art/machine.

A fun way to spend a bit of time.",1211414400,,292,4.017241379310345
2704816,3,B000LC3IT2,"The DVD is entertaining and contains a boat load of great cars, of course, however it's not as funny as the show ""Top Gear"".  That being said the DVD has this feature, which lets you cut out all the music so you can listen just to the car engines.",1210809600,,247,4.040816326530612
2704817,4,B000LC3IT2,"Nope this isn't as good as Top Gear, but it does feature some superb cars, as well as the rubbish.

FYI the cars are:
Maserati Quattroporte
Renault Espace
Aston Martin DB9 Volante, Aston Martin V8 Vantage
Range Rover Sport
Triumph TR7
Ford Scorpio
Perodua Kelisa
BMW M5
Ferrari F340, Ferrari Enzo, Ferrari 612 Scaglietti
VW Golf GTI
Citroen 2CV
Chevrolet Corvette
TVR Sagaris
Vauxhall Monaro

As some previous reviewers have already said, in places it is funny, but it lacks the spark that Clarkson has when he's working with Hammond and May. He may be the star, and the best thing about Top Gear, but he is not as good without Hammond and May.

Fortunately for me I picked this up very cheap. If I'd paid the normal price for this it would only have got 3 stars from me.",1209081600,,771,4.492857142857143
2704818,3,B000LC3IT2,"I bought this DVD as I am a huge fan of Top Gear and needed more to get me through between episodes.  The DVD is basically about a dozen or so car features like Top Gear already shows.  There are some cars which Jeremy claims are great and goes through the sideways tire smoking sequences he is known for.  And then there are a few cars which he destroys as they are rubbish.

The other reviews say that this is not as good as Top Gear, and I will have to agree.  The reason is that it is all car review segments which are just as good as ones in the show, but it really gets to be too much.  All the other segments of Top Gear along with the interaction of three hosts together really make the show.

Basically if you are a huge fan of Top Gear, especially Clarkson's car review segments, its worth picking up, but it's not a must have. If you think the show is all right, it probably wouldn't be worth it.",1205366400,,907,4.061797752808989
2704819,4,B000LC3IT2,"The DVD is entertaining, yes, but does not feature Hammond or May - and suffers a bit by their absence.

The true test was when I tried to watch this with my wife (who is definitely *not* a ""car person"").  While she and I watch Top Gear together - in fact, she even prompts ME when there is a new episode on BBC America ! - she lost interest in this DVD within 5 minutes, once whe realized that it featured Clarkson exclusively (with only a minor bit with The Stig).  She complained that it just wasn't the same without the rest of ""the lads"", and the humor is kind of flat.  I agreed.

So, if you are looking for a Top Gear on DVD experience, this is not it.

But I still enjoyed it...so I give it a 4 of 5 star rating.",1204761600,,720,3.9652777777777777
2704820,1,B000LC3IT2,"Why does Jeremy Clarkson hate American cars so much? Even when they do something right, if not better than most European cars, why does he strive to find flaws in them? He is entertaining at the price of appearing annoying , stuck-up, and attention obsessed.",1202083200,3,258,4.7555555555555555
2704821,5,B000LC3IT2,"Top Gear has got to be the best car show of all time.  Very funny and informative.  This DVD is mostly about supercars.  But if you catch the TV show they review ""attainable"" cars as well.

So if want to drool over some exotics and laugh as they smash up some beaters this is the DVD for you.",1201651200,,292,3.9827586206896552
2704822,5,B000LC3IT2,"I purchased this item for my husband as part of his Christmas present.  We have watched it a few times.  Clarkson is at his best.  We absolutely love his wit. Jeremy Clarkson is unique in his presentation, we have watched him on Top Gear for years and never tire of his exploits.  I recommend this DVD wholeheartedly.",1200787200,,317,4.508771929824562
2704823,4,B000LC3IT2,"first off, i'll say this is definitely an enjoyable romp for petrolheads like myself.  i should point out that this is the seven best cars released in the 2005 model year, not the seven best cars of all time.  that said, the cars are spectacular.  the seven worst aren't necessarily the worst ever, but they're definitely bad ones deserving of the punishment rendered unto them.
my biggest criticism of this film is there's really nothing to break up each of the segments (if they can even be called segments); the reviews kind of run together, and though there's definitely something like a stopping place after he destroys a car (or two), clarkson moves on to the next car quickly, and eventually it just felt like i needed a break.  as a result, though i was able to enjoy all the cars brought forth (including the fairly stunning finale), the film felt much longer than it actually was.  73 minutes seemed much closer to two hours than to one.",1198886400,,947,4.613095238095238
2704824,5,B000LC3IT2,"Clarkson Heaven and Hell is a movie that must be in your collection weather you like cars or not. It is an awesome movie, yes it provides you with stats on the newest and coolest not to mention the old and decrepit however it provides non-stop laughs that would even be great for kids. The entire show is based upon the 7 cars that he ""Jeremy Clarkson"" would take to heaven with him and 7 cars that he would send to hell, and those who go to hell are killed in very...unique ways to say the least. If you like the the show ""TOP GEAR"" or Jeremy Clarkson in genereal and even if you don't either way ""Clarkson Heaven and Hell"" really is an entertaining show that everyone should see.",1198627200,,681,4.246153846153846

8161361,4,B000LC3IT2,"On this DVD that runs a bit over an hour (74 minutes or so) we get British motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson using his usual hyperbole and hypercritical idiom to discuss a whole slew of very expensive and unobtainable cars as well as some cars he reserves a special hatred for.

All up it is entertaining in a sort of charmingly mindless fashion as he rips apart (literally) his pet hates and spends in inordinate amount of time in boyish enjoyment of blazing about a race track in yet another car the rest of us will only ever get to admire in a showroom. It's actually the latter that gets tedious first with Clarkson but those familiar with the Top Gear franchise of which he is the major cog will know exactly what they are getting by throwing this into their shopping cart.

Highly recommended for those who enjoy Top Gear (though this lacks the interplay and so is not up to the fun fact of that series) and it comes with some extra features such as a photo gallery so you can drool a little further over the latest microscopically updated variant of some Ferrari or Lamborghini.",1398470400,,1087,4.5126903553299496

8161363,4,B000LC3IT2,"I was hoping for a little more in every way, don't get me wrong it's entertaining in a very Jeremy Clarkson's way, DON'T expect a 1 man Top Gear DVD because that's not what you'll be buying, he'll test drive some cars, wreck some others but that's pretty much it, this videos is only recommended for big fans like myself otherwise you might find it boring (just ask my girlfriend).",1358985600,,381,4.457142857142857
8161364,4,B000LC3IT2,"Overall, this is a very great little DVD. Jeremy is great! However, you get the feeling that some things are missing. Namely, James May, Richard Hammond, and the laughter and silliness that the whole gang usually experiences. Don't get me wrong, Jeremy still says some brilliant stuff, but I have seen some Top Gear episodes that beat this.

In conclusion, for $12, its worth it. But you may want to consider spending a bit extra to buy an entire series of Top Gear. Happy buying!",1289433600,,480,4.647058823529412
