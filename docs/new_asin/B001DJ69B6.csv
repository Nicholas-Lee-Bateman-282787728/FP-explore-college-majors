3531842,5,B001DJ69B6,Very well documented and professionally produced. A must for any passionate fan of Alabama Crimson Tide football or college football historians.,1355356800,,144,5.904761904761905
3531843,5,B001DJ69B6,Even before this Saturday 11/03/2012 I was really going to buy this. Actually I had bought it before the game. Which ended up being very exciting but heart wrenching. To bad they couldn't add this game to the DVD. But love seeing some of the past players and plays. Can't go wrong for any Bama Fan.,1352160000,,298,4.339285714285714
3531844,5,B001DJ69B6,This was a gift for my boyfriend. He sat and watched all the videos in one sitting. He says it is a must for any Alabama Fan!! I am a LSU fan so I did not watch it. Geaux Tigers!! LOL,1324944000,,183,3.4878048780487805
3531845,4,B001DJ69B6,"Perfect for the Alabama fan that doesn't have everything, but if they tape all the games it's just a repeat of what they already own. That's what I found out from my brother when I gave it to him for Xmas. He liked it but he already had every game on the DVD's on tape. A little expensive for a repeat just on DVD when you can transfer them your self.",1308009600,,351,3.9577464788732395
3531846,5,B001DJ69B6,"Before I give my review, I need to give a short background, which will make sense when I am done.  My dad played football at Wake Forest, and my cousins played basketball at NC State.  However, I was offered a full scholarship, including a R.A. in the Masters of Tax Program at Alabama.

Now, I grew up outside of Philly, and went to hundreds of Phillies games; as well as my fair share of ACC football games.  Words can not describe the football culture of Alabama.  One could honestly teach not just one, but a few college courses on the history of the program.  I went to Alabama in 2005, I try to read as many books as I can, watch DVDs such as the one above, and I feel that I might know maybe 25% of their football history.

The DVDs are very well done, and what I liked about it is that the do not focus on just one specific time period, but covered moments from the 60's, 70's, and the 80's.  Also, they interview the players that were involved in these famous moments as well.  Just listening to their recollection is amazing because instead of having a reporter or a writer tell you what happened, you have the actual players that were involved telling their stories.  I wish Alabama would come out with a 2nd set, there are plenty of more moments to choose from",1275177600,14,1272,4.30672268907563
3531847,5,B001DJ69B6,"The recent release of the Alabama's Defining Moments DVD package is the most well done project (in this area of sports) I have seen. The enterviews are excellent, the extended interviews and excellent, the background material on some of the coaching recruitment segments, such as DVD ""Win # 315"" is perhaps my favorite. Showing Brewton,Alabama and video and comments by QB Walter Lewis and his mother and father is perhaps the best. Although ""Goal Line Stand"", has great analysis and Barry Kraus's interview rates at the top of my favorite material.

I look at the tapes 3 to 4 times per week--its a good time to watch the DVDs during the off season.

Anyway, I don't think the team that put this together could have done a thing better to improve this collection. The DVD's are a history book of Alabama Football. The DVD's are probably are great recruiting tools for new prospects, however, I do not know if this would violate NCAA rules and regulations.

Order this series online today, before this fall.
