The episodes included are: ""High Noon In Mayberry,"" ""The Big House,"" ""Mountain Wedding,"" ""A Wife For Andy,"" ""Opie And The Spoiled Kid,"" ""Rafe Hollister Sings,"" ""The Loaded Goat,"" ""The Great Filling Station Robbery,"" ""Andy Discovers America,"" ""Aunt Bee's Medicine Man,"" and ""The Darlings Are Coming"".",1107043200,7,406,5.230769230769231
7984005,1,B00008G6UP,"How can they do this to a great show and great actor(s) like Andy Griffith. The DVDs' quality is the most horrible and made a fan like me feel very sorry for them.

So upset and sad. I never touch that DVD ever again.",1100736000,12,217,3.9318181818181817
7984006,1,B00008G6UP,"There is only one way to package classic TV programs, and that's one box set per season, in order of original air date. As long as the people who own the rights to this program insist on releasing a few episodes in haphazard order (and then repackaging them in a 'Marathon', whatever that's supposed to mean), we should refuse to buy them. When  the full 'The Andy Griffith Show, Season One', box set comes out, I'll be first in line to buy it. Meanwhile, we shouldn't buy ripoffs.",1090454400,21,481,4.465909090909091
7984007,1,B00008G6UP,"To those of you who seem not to be bothered about fake theme music, scratch and hiss in the sound, and a less than DVD quality picture, you do all of the purists and true lovers of these shows a disservice.  Purists like myself (and there are many tens of thousands of us) are not ""whiners"" and ""malcontents"", we simply realize what DVD technology is capable of, and that anytime a production company does not adhere to DVD standards and tries to trick the general public into thinking that they are getting the original ""T.A.G.S."", then we rebel.
No matter the series, all we want is this:  Release full-season box sets in chronological order and in a reasonable timeframe.  Studio heads please note that you are dealing with conscientious consumers who are very well versed with all of the underhanded and egregious practices that many production companies employ to maximize profits.  And remember that even if the quality of a release (sound, picture, original music, etc.) is addressed, if you simply place the individual DVD's in a simple slip case (i.e., the pitiful and overpriced ""I LOVE LUCY"" comes to mind - the sound and picture were superb, and it had the original intros and music, but Paramount Home Studios simply took the original nine ""I LOVE LUCY"" shrink-wrapped DVD's and placed them in a cardboard slip case.  What a copout!!!), you are going to have a ""no sale"".
Well, this ripoff of ""THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW"" encompasses at least three of the aforementioned DVD no-no's:  (1) Not a full-season box set, (2) Scratchy sound and video worse than VHS tape, and (3) Altered theme music.
I have no qualms about pricing as long as the quality issues discussed are present.  But if the quality and originality issues are not addressed, then count me out.",1077753600,46,1768,4.777049180327869
7984008,3,B00008G6UP,All of these reviews complain about how the episodes are not listed on the box.  How about listing them in your review?  Then your review would be most helpful.,1075593600,17,160,4.482758620689655
7984009,5,B00008G6UP,"At first I was hesitant to buy any Andy Griffith Show on DVD.  After reading the reviews of other Andy Griffith show DVD's I was scared away by reviewers who listed how the opening theme song was not included or that video or sound were not that great.  The Andy Griffith Marathon DVD came out in February 2003 and because there were no reviews of it at at the time either negative or positive, I decided to take a chance.  Am I ever glad that I did!  With the Andy Griffith Marathon DVD you get both the opening and closing theme music and both the video and audio are great.  In all it comes on three DVD's with 6 shows on each DVD for a total of 18 shows.  The shows are the classics when Don Knotts starring as Barney was on the show.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to sit back and enjoy the Andy Griffith Show at it's very best. The Andy Griffith shows not only makes you laugh but each show gives you a lesson on life.  I am glad that now, like in childhood, I can sit down with my own son and daughter to share these timeless treasures.",1073433600,25,1054,4.08252427184466
