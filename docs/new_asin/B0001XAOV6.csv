2042222,1,B0001XAOV6,"I sent this picture to an english friend who likes Pedro Infante's pictures as a gift, because the description of the product says that it has subtitles in English. I was very disapointed when my friend, who by the way does not speak Spanish, called to thank me for the gift but she told me that this DVD does not have subtitles at all, so she could not watch the movie to the end because she was not understanding the plot.
I consider this a scam!",1285718400,2,448,4.22093023255814
2042223,5,B0001XAOV6,One of Pedro Infante's best comedies. I love his movies for the clean comedy. It is the one to buy if you are looking to laugh and have an ejoyable evening.,1250380800,,156,4.064516129032258
2042224,5,B0001XAOV6,"""Escuela de Vagabundos"" is hilarious, with the kind of sharp, clever wit that is a thing of the past, joyous slapstick, sweet romance, and gorgeous music. It takes a lot to make me laugh out loud, and this film will make you laugh until it hurts, guaranteed. When we first meet Jose Alberto Medina, his car has gone up in smoke and down a ravine, and his bucket has a hole in it; he wanders to the nearest residence, a mansion where the Senora of the house, Emilia, gushes over him, thinking he is the latest in her ""vagabundos."" It seems that Emilia feels so blessed to have all she has, that she takes in wandering hobos, to feed them and educate them, and though Medina just wants to use the telephone, he gets embroiled in this wonderful but crazy family, and ends up being their ""chauffeur,"" and so much more.

Pedro Infante is superb as Medina. His songs are a marvel, and include ""Nana Pancha,"" where he dances around in an undershirt looking incredibly buff, the super romantic ""Grito Prisionero,"" ""Quien Sera,"" which has a melody you hum for days after hearing it (many will remember Dean Martin and Bobby Rydell having hits with this song as ""Sway,"") and a glorious ""Cucurrucucu Paloma,"" with the Mariachi Vargas. The rest of the large cast is also marvelous, and includes Miroslava Stern as Susana Valverde, Blanca de Castejon as her daffy but adorable mother Emilia, Oscar Pulido as gruff father Miguel Valverde, and Eduardo Alcaraz, the origin of much of the humor as Audifas the butler. Directed by Rogelio Gonzalez  with lovely cinematography by Rosalio Solano, this is romantic comedy at its brightest and best, and possibly the funiest film ever made. Not to be missed by Infante fans. The film is in good condition despite its age, and no subtitles are available.",1176422400,6,1781,4.705128205128205
