8490998,3,B00622WA44,"I thought this movie well acted and directed. Sanjay was that character. As a new comer to Indian movies , I closed my eyes a few times! But, I learned about the country and how some things look and feel to some people. I will probably watch other films of this kind.",1375574400,,267,4.153846153846154
8490999,4,B00622WA44,"Although it lifts scenes directly from the hurt locker, and one or two of the Jason Bourne films, there is a lot more to Lamhaa than you might think.

In fact, one of the film's weaknesses is that it strives to imitate where it should really innovate. The shaky handheld camera work is akin to the Bourne films but doesn't really suit the strong dramatic story of Lamhaa.

Having said that, the film is interesting, historical and also genuinely exciting.

I was delighted by Bipasha Basu's performance in the film, she is more than capable of shouldering a more serious role than in her previous film roles, and Sanjay Dutt plays his role with the usual charisma and self assured confidence that we have become used to.

This is a great little movie and I recommend it to anyone who also wants to take in the beautiful scenery of Kashmir.",1307404800,,839,4.573333333333333
8491000,3,B00622WA44,Lamhaa was pretty good for a bollywood movie. they may have exagerated the situation in kasmir a wee bit but all in all it was a good hindi film.,1300406400,,145,4.0344827586206895
8491001,2,B00622WA44,"Lamhaa is a film about Kashmir and in trying to create an unbiased film the director Dholakhia almost succeeds but fails in execution and narration. The underlying theme is, there will no peace in Kashmir because no one wants peace.
It is the time of elections in Kashmir and the Army suspects that some militants are going to create some sort of disturbance. So they hire an undercover expert Sanjay Dutt to investigate. During his investigation he bumps in to a host of characters such as Bipasha Basu (Aziza) in a deglamorised appearance, an honest young politician who truly wants to make a difference -Kunal Kapoor, a leader Anupham Kher whose intentions are suspects and a variety of other sleazy sorts. The film is interesting at times but the filmmaker tries to pack a lot of things during the run and this becomes messy. The film succeeds because it is an unbiased look at the current situation, accurate or not and stumbles because the narration is very choppy. The music of the film by Mithoon, which I thought was superb has been used ineffectively and at inappropriate times. James Fowlds the director of cinematography has done a fantastic job in making the valley look beautiful. However the movie was just as messy as Kashmir is today. Two stars. 1/16/11",1296345600,,1270,4.80365296803653
8491002,3,B00622WA44,"Kashmir is the most beautiful place on earth, many say, and the most dangerous. Its heaven/hell dichotomy--from soaring snowcapped mountains and serene valley waters to barbed-wire coils and bombed-out buildings--is captured with moving effect in 'Lamhaa' by the cinematography of James Fowlds.

'Lamhaa' is unusual in that it was even shot in Kashmir. Once a common setting for romantic musical numbers, the picturesque locale was largely abandoned by Bollywood two decades ago because of unrest--and lovers trysted in the Swiss Alps instead. Not that Bollywood has ignored Kashmir's troubles--it's been the subject of many films, such as 'Roja' (1992) and 'Fanaa' (2006)--but both were shot elsewhere.

In 'Lamhaa,' the images say more than the story; the extras more than the leads. Such small-minded violence amidst such natural grandeur; so many children and nearly as many women fill the frames while men are notably absent--they're either dead or plotting in the shadows.

Kashmir is a region that's been disputed by India, Pakistan, and China since Partition in 1947, and there's also a separatist movement within it. India and Pakistan have fought three wars over it (in 1947, 1965, and 1999) and an armed insurgency has existed there since 1989. It's like every other hot spot in the world--the leaders on all sides don't really want peace because the conflict is the source of their power, and the people caught in the middle are endlessly manipulated and victimized.

Which is the point of 'Lamhaa'--the film doesn't take sides, but merely shows the utter corruption and hopelessness of it all. But realism doesn't always make for much of a story. There's no real conflict in the narrative, other than the overarching conflict of the situation, and even though bullets are flying and bombs exploding, there's no tension or suspense.

'Lamhaa' is so balanced that even the blatantly bad guys veer toward sympathetic. Tremendous character actor Anupam Kher plays Haji, a firebrand separatist leader, with such sincerity that he almost seems reasonable.

Bipasha Basu as Haji's adopted daughter Aziza is no bombshell per usual, but a burqa-wearing Lara Croft. Fierce has always been Basu's forte, but even when she's reduced to a whimpering weakling later on, she steps up to the emotional demands of the role.

Kunal Kapoor plays Aatif, a former insurgent turned political candidate. He's earnest, idealistic--and so milquetoast it's impossible to believe he was ever a militant. He doesn't make for much of a peaceful leader either--inspirational he is not.

Sanjay Dutt plays Vikram, an undercover military intelligence agent who must stop an impending terrorist attack. The story is told from the perspective of this impervious bear of a man. He is the outsider; he is us, the audience, looking in on the mess, disturbed by it, but not a part of it.
