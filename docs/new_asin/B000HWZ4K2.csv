8142022,5,B000HWZ4K2,These dvds played wonderfully & the case was new! Awesome piece to add to my collection. I was happy with this & the price was right.,1382745600,,133,4.153846153846154
8142023,5,B000HWZ4K2,"I purchased this set for Beavis and Butthead and Team America. I am not a jackass fan at all. Both movies I wanted had really good translations of the films and I was satisfied. Also, was cheaper to get this set instead of buying those 2 movies separately at the time I purchased. Great set at a fantastic price. 5 stars",1381708800,,320,4.262295081967213
8142024,5,B000HWZ4K2,"What can I say that isn't already known?  Beavis and Butthead, I think the name says it all.  Funny movie not a fan of them then it's truly your loss.
Team America, now this movie is one messed up funny movie.  Puppets doing the unthinkable, making fun of America, don't have a great sense of humor don't watch the movie.
Jack Ass.  Do I really need to say more about this disturbing movie about a group of thrill seekers that need some therapy?",1328400000,,445,4.325301204819277
8142025,5,B000HWZ4K2,"This is a great investment. Team America and Beavis and Butthead are AMAZING films, so funny both of them. Jackass is pretty good but gets old after awhile but it is a really nice bonus. I suggest you people buy this  totally random awesome pack.",1244160000,2,246,4.466666666666667
