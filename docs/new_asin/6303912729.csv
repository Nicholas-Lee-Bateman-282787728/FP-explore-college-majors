723765,1,6303912729,"One day me and my daughter were looking for a workout video (seeing that she's only 12) I decided to buy all of Claudia's work videos thinking that they were good.  To my surprise, its not really much of a work out video.  It's more of a guy video.  Sure men are easily entertained by this video,  but I think she shouldn't of wasted her time in making this video.  I  wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all.  I'am a bodybuilder, and to me  this video is totally silly. Nothing but a bunch of men will enjoy  watching this video.",922924800,,529,4.21

723919,5,6303912729,This video has been one of my staple favorites for years. I like to stay fit without hours at the gym or killing myself and this is perfect. It helps me stay toned without getting bulked up.,1369526400,,190,4.162162162162162
723920,5,6303912729,"I love this. Useful even 20 years later. Decent music, good cinematography, classic, tried and true movements with some modernization. With VCRs going the way of cassette tapes please put this, and the entire series even, on DVD. The Ab DVD is my personal favorite in the series.",1363564800,,279,4.833333333333333
723921,5,6303912729,"If I haven't worked out for a couple months or longer, Claudia Schiffer's Perfectly Fit is great to get back into shape without wrecking your body for the first week. I highly recommend: BUNS, ARMS, & ABS. You will have TONED results. I also LOVE to double run the ABS after 2 weeks! These are a low-impact but, that doesn't mean that they won't give you results. I have limitations on my ankles & minor knee issues. THESE ARE PERFECT for me! I have 2 lb, 3 lb, & 4 lb dumbbells. Start with the 2 pounders, when they become easy- go a poundage up. So you won't be super sore for about 3 days.

All vids are effective & at a even pace as well as a lot of variety in movements. Feels one-on-one. If you need a sec to drink water or position mat for the next step- you can during here & there intros to the next segment.

It took awhile to gain the weight as equally as shedding it off. I am approaching 40 & have used her 3 titles for a decade! No 'diet supplements' about it = )

I also have sports asthma because I grew up with people who smoked indoors. I need inhaler just before doing the BUNS & ABS. No inhaler needed for the ARMS.",1352419200,,1135,4.058035714285714

723923,5,6303912729,"I started doing this video in 1998 (thereabouts?) and it is still one of my favorites. I absolutely love Kathy Kaehler, the trainer in this video, and I think her moves are great and effective, and they also minimize any chances of injury. My only complaint is why in the world has this not been made into dvd yet???? We don't have a vcr anymore, so now my VHS is completely useless to me. I would buy the entire perfectly fit set if they would put it on dvd! I have searched and searched for the dvd online, and the only thing that ever comes up is the VHS version, along with articles that talk about how the ""Perfectly Fit"" series made the bestseller list. If it was so popular, then why have they not updated it so it can be viewed/used with today's technology??? Grrr!!

Anyway, I love the way Kathy Kaehler's videos are shot, too. The music and backgrounds are low key and usually involve waves/oceans/beaches, which always make me feel more relaxed while I am still getting a good workout. She gives a lot of tips on technique, also, which is nice, and helps you to maximize results. Love it!",1317340800,,1099,4.413793103448276
723924,5,6303912729,"I usually skip the warm up because I don't find it necessary, and I do wish it could be available in dvd format. However, this video definitely has incredible results. Claudia Schiffer's great figure definitely motivated me to keep with it.  I usually stick with a workout routine for 2-3 weeks and quit, but this tape is so good I've actually stuck with it for a month now! Highly Recommended!",1268265600,2,394,4.628571428571429
723925,5,6303912729,I had one Claudia Schiffer Tape and used it for years until it broke. I thought Id never run across them again until I found them on your site!. Thanks. I bought not just one but all of them. I'm back the business of looking great!,1259020800,,231,4.043478260869565
723926,5,6303912729,"The main reason I keep my VCR is to do the Claudia Schiffer Perfectly Fit videos (Arms, Abs, Legs, and Buns).  If they were on DVD, I'd buy them again.  I love the visuals ... historic Prague, the beach, antique-y graphics, frames of both Claudia and Kathy (the trainer) doing the exercises.  I like the smooth music and soothing voices.  No yelling, banging, forced peppiness, or boring rooms here.  Simple, targeted workout.  All you need is a chair, a mat, and weights (I use 3-pounders).  Do in conjunction with a walking or running routine and healthy eating, and you'll be hot!  Hang in there if you don't get the moves immediately - you'll get to know the routine after a few repeats, and it will start to feel really good.  I like that Claudia isn't always as smooth or evenly-paced as Kathy.  It helps me be forgiving of my own imperfections.  After all, the important thing is just doing it!",1246838400,,901,4.56875
723927,5,6303912729,"I love all of her workout tapes abs, buns, legs and arms.  It is hard enough to build on, but not complicated routines.  Simple yet effective.  The background is beautiful and the music is relaxing.  It's perfect for after an aerobic workout.  I lost 40lbs using these tapes in high school and now that I just had a baby.  I'll be using it again to get back into shape.",1246147200,,369,4.27536231884058
723981,5,6303912729,"Great tape, and as promised, if you finish it, you'll do 180 crunches. There is room to add weight for those seeking something harder, but I find this both challenging and fun to watch. It's beautifully filmed with some interesting standing ab exercises as well as the crunches you've come to expect. Wish these were on DVD, but thankfully, I still have a VCR for my gym. Worth checking out.",1241395200,,391,4.6
723982,5,6303912729,"A great workout for your arms...not to build muscle, but to tone and burn fat. Lots of solid exercises with plenty of repetitions. Special attention to triceps, too! Claudia rotates through the various arm exercises, interspersed with sets of push-ups, and a great warm-up and cool-down, too. Good exercises for your upper back and shoulders round things out. Kathy Kaehler works with Claudia while she goes through various exercises to improve her form, but you'll mostly see Claudia on her own. Beautifully filmed with interchanging frames and settings. Gorgeous scenery in St. Bart's and Prague keep you at peace while Claudia's body keeps you motivated!",1237420800,,657,5.266666666666667
723983,3,6303912729,"this is a good video to use with minimal equipment to purchase. but its for people that are already fit. if you're just starting it, don't do as many reps until you get used to all the exercises. or use light weights.",1229299200,,217,4.190476190476191
723984,5,6303912729,"Hey guys, how you doing? Feeling tired from yoru work out? Me too! You know, if I could give this video more stars than 5, I would, I really would. Um, the only thing that makes me sick, (after doing the actual work out, of course) is the thought of what our good ol' Claudia Schiffer looks like NOW A DAYS. I mean, she's pretty much a milf in this videos, but now... well, she's probably still a milf.

Um, anyways, I find my arms to be significantly larger than they were before I viewed this work out tape. THIS **** WORKS OVER NIGHT, YO. Matter of fact, my good friend Debbie, who joined my small group of Claudia enthusiasts, actually morphed into a very tight bunned, tight abbed, tight legged, tight armed, blonde woman OVER NIGHT. She was craaaaazay.

Anyways, if you want to not only work out your arms, but turn your best friends into milfs, BUY THIS VHS BEFORE IT GOES OUT OF STOCK. And if not, you can email me, at maximopiper987654321@aim.com and I will sell you this for a VERY low price, considering what it's worth. (Who can't spare a few hundreds?)

Thanks for reading my review. I now love you.

P.S. If you see any women who resemble Claudia Schiffer, who are not her, please contact this number: 860-844-1337.",1225670400,,1229,4.448888888888889
723985,5,6303912729,"The entire series is amazing. I had them on VHS and got rid of them once we converted to dvd. I would love to buy these again, but who has a vcr any more. Anyone know where I can get them in dvd...I'd buy the entire series today. Serious serious workouts.",1214956800,,255,4.019607843137255
723986,5,6303912729,"Although I have long since retired the VHS tapes for DVDs, Claudia Schiffer's 4 workout tapes for arms, abs, legs and buns are the best of the best.  Before pilates and yoga took off as the current trends, these tapes were pushing them and delivering results that WORK.  I just rediscovered this after being inspired by a fitness friend to find the best of the best upper body workout, and I dusted this one off.  I wish that these workouts would be reissued on DVD, but I'm sure some have uploaded them on YouTube.  This consists of lateral lifts, overhead lifts, bicept curls, front lifts (strait arms and under the chin), dips, chest presses, chest flies, single arm skull crushers (aka French presses), and double arm chest lifts with sets of pushups in between.

Please be forewarned : this is HARD.  It's basic, but anything that's repeated over and over, especially if you are in moderate to poor shape, is a strain.  Pace yourself.  All of her tapes have sets of 3, I recommend you do 1 to start yourself out with for a while.  Over time you can challenge yourself to go up to 2, then 3.  Otherwise you will wake up the next morning stiff as a board.  Also start off with 3 lb weights and over time build up to 5 lbs.  If you feel you can do it, take it even heavier.  I have now been using her arm workout consistently for the last four weeks and I feel ready to take it to the next level of 8 lb weights which I just started easing myself into.  If you are in poor shape to begin with, this (like all of her workouts) will leave you in pain the next day.  Also, there is a difference between strength training and toning.  Both are effective, no question.  Start with a smaller amount of reps (8 for strength, 12-14 for toning) then build your way to doing more.  Strength will make you stronger if you lift a great amount of weight, toning will give you definition and burn fat.  But you can't have both until you are stronger.

The only words of criticism I have are for the artsy backdrops to it.  It gives you something to look at rather than just Claudia in a boring gym, but I don't think she works out in empty warehouses with her hair perfectly coiffed and flawless make up.",1188345600,,2192,4.323529411764706
723987,5,6303912729,"I have had this video for years and I still use it because it is the best arm workout I have found to date.  It is a complete upper body workout that works upper back, chest and, of course, arms.  Quick, to the point workout (it's a 30 minute video) that delivers visible results.",1187481600,,280,4.166666666666667
723988,4,6303912729,"I absolutely love all of Kathy Kaehler's stuff. This video is fun to watch with great scenery and pleasant music. There is never a ""in your face"" kind of feel, and Kathy's voice is great to listen to. However, please don't follow Claudia's fast, jerky movements, and her long limbs make her look even more jerky. I have no problem with this video when I go at my own pace and follow Kathy's instructions. I try not to look at Claudia half the time because her pace is comical at times even though she is very beautiful.

I'd like to see it on DVD, but I'm not sure if the Perfectly Fit series has enough of a following to do that. But, it would be nice to see it as a boxed four pack DVD series or combined on two DVDs.

Recommendation: If Claudia's fast movements put you off, you have to try Cindy Crawford/ Kathy Kaehler's ""A New Dimension"" DVD. There are 3 workouts with different levels. Although it is made for new moms, the 41 minute workout is a killer (and it's been 6 years since I had a child)! Plus, you get to see beautiful footage of Cindy and her baby, and it has some fun, favorite music of the late 90's such as ""Kiss Me"". I never tire of this DVD.",1182988800,,1165,4.173333333333333
723989,5,6303912729,"I have owned all four of the Claudia Schiffer workout tapes since they come out over ten years ago. I'm a workout tape junkie, I have dozens, but these are my faves. Claudia is a pleasure to watch - very real, which is a nice break from some of the perky instructors on many tapes. She even struggles at times, which is encouraging for us non-models! There are frequent pop-ins of her trainer explaining correct form to keep it all professional. The workouts include target specific exercises, usually with 10-30 reps each, and a warm-up and cool-down. If you're a beginner, you may not be able to complete all the reps the first few times you do these workouts...and you will be sore!! But after a few times you will see and feel the results and you'll be hooked!! Highly, highly recommended!",1179360000,,793,4.591549295774648
723990,5,6303912729,"I've been working with this video for a week, and find it wonderful. To echo the other reviewers, it's nothing fancy, but it's enough of a variety on crunches to keep you interested -- and really worked out. The first time I went through I couldn't even finish it, though the second time I went all the way through.

Near the end of the video there's a crunch variation which provides little or no support for the neck -- you might want to consider modifying that for yourself if you have neck problems.

The video is odd because you hear mostly Kaehler's lower, softer voice giving instructions, counts, and tips, with a few of the main instructions and encouragements from Schiffer. I kind of liked it though, especially because Kaheler is rather soothing.",1165968000,,758,4.69172932330827
724031,5,6303912729,"This is an essential, highly effective workout. I've had it for years, and whenever I see my abs get a little poochy, I pop this in my VCR. Did I mention how gret it would be if they put this out on DVD?!  I've even received comments on how flat my abs are following so much as one of these workouts. Good cueing, good flow of routine. I normally skip the cool down portion,and do my own, as I don't think there's anything special about it- would have given 4 1/2 stars if possible. But again, this is a highly effective and reliable ab workout.",1151971200,,545,4.190476190476191
724032,5,6303912729,"I have used this tape four weeks now, twice a week with 5 lb. weights, and it still isn't easy to do. My arms and shoulders feel worked! There are three sets of each exercise, which actually work my muscles to fatigue. I really like how this combination of exercises works all three aspects of the deltoids, as well as the upper back, chest and arms. I'm getting ready for summer, none too soon. I'm sure this series of tapes will get me there. (I especially like the legs workout as well.)",1140825600,5,490,4.336956521739131
724033,5,6303912729,"I started this tape in the beginning of January 2006. I started out with 3 lb weights and after three weeks I was up to 5 lb weights.

I cannot beging to describe how effective this is. After 2 months, I still sweat and I still push to do all the reps. When I first started out, I couldn't do a single push up now I can do all sets.

I was curious as to why this tape focuses so much on triceps and so little on biceps. My fiance (who is a weight-lifting buff) said that the upper arms are 80% tricep and only 20% bicep. Many people make the mistake of working out the bicep more than the tricep. Your triceps will HURT after the first day. After that, you will want to keep working them to get rid of that ""jiggle.""

Buy this tape - you will not be disappointed!",1140652800,6,763,3.973856209150327
724034,5,6303912729,"I have had this tape since 1998 and it's still one of the best routines I've encountered even after taking special abs classes at the gym. I've tried other convoluted ab moves by instructors at the gym, but I often go back to this video because sometimes you just want a simple and effective ab workout. This is especially the case when I had to go to physically therapy for my low back/tail bone. My back pain prevented me from performing many ab exercises, but most the moves in this video were safe enough for me to do without aggravating my back as long as I kept my knees slightly bent.

Like many reviewers here, I agree that you should watch Kathy Kaehler's demonstrations at the beginning of each segment rather than observe Claudia Schiffer for form. Otherwise you'll end up using your limbs instead of your abs to perform the moves. If you only use your abs, you moves won't be exaggerated like Claudia's but the workout will be much more intense. It's important to initiate all the exercises from your abdominals.

Beginners will probably need the rest sections between moves to stretch or to finish up their repetitions while advanced people will probably find that will slow down the pace. The best way advanced exercisers to increase intensity is to fast forward over the stretching sections. That way you can still use the video and walk away with sore abs the next day.

This video deserves 5 stars because it's a great workout even with all the level adjustments. I have a lot of workout DVDs with abs sections that just aren't as effective as this video tape. It's one of the few reasons I still own a VCR.",1139616000,8,1624,4.573883161512027
724035,5,6303912729,"I completely agree with the review by ""pioq"" given 4/17/03, on every point. But would like to add that if you are like me, unable to take high impact exercise, you will probably enjoy this series for its intense yet gentle approach. Repetition is key, and the stretching and cool-downs are also very effective. I can count on these workouts to give me results that are quick to show and feel plus they are long lasting. And they speak for themselves.",1133827200,3,450,4.567901234567901
724036,5,6303912729,i have to admit that the workouts are really good and very effective but PLEASE DURING THE AB ROUTINE WATCH THE INSTRUCTOR FOR GOOD FORM as claudia technique is very poor.,1132790400,,171,4.548387096774194
724037,1,6303912729,I don't know what everybody is talking about but I found this video an aubsolute bore. To say the least I wasn't even challenged at all. To crown it all I can not return it as I purchased the same from Uganda.,1069632000,,209,4.0
724038,5,6303912729,I really Love the Perfectly Fit series. They are a great way to tone up. What I really like is that there is not a distracting group of people behind the main person or trainer. I LOVE it. Thank you Kathy Kaehler and Claudia Schiffer.,1054598400,,234,4.222222222222222
724039,5,6303912729,"I have used about 25+ tapes during and after college. The Claudia Schiffer tapes remain in my top 5. The reasons are:
1. Kathy Kaehler is the REAL instructor here. She gives calm, sound advice as you are doing the moves. You usually see her pop up for each excercise doing it in perfect form. There is no hyper and annoying shouting and bouncing. The way she talks and instructs, it's just like this smooth intense instruction.
2. The scenery and the music. The music is not your favorite tunes or super motivating, it's just background soothing filler. almost like spa music. The scenerey is diferent for a video. I am sick of seeing people in a plain old gym.
3. Claudia, let's face it, you can see she wasn't meant to be an aerobics intructor, but she's beautiful and not bad inspiration. Sometimes when she talks you just feel like they gave her a script. but it's nothing major. Kathy is the driving force.
4. THese workouts WORK! The arms and the legs... very effective as well.",1050537600,14,984,4.533707865168539
724040,5,6303912729,"This video would be better with a few modifications
1 Claudia should workout with cindy
2 The outfits should include leggings to hide her skinny legs.
3 The music should include more beat like snoop dog
4 She needs a sidekick like radu for cindy",1041033600,3,245,4.466666666666667
724081,5,6303912729,"This one is the best for abs.  Buy it and all her videos.  Really neat, well produced, pleasant.  She is cool to work out with.  Tough enough to get those abs firm.

724082,4,6303912729,"I used this video only for my arm workout for almost a year and started to get bored... even though it worked great and my arms were very toned and muscular. I tried other videos just to see if there was some other one that was also good, and realized that this one was by far the best. I love the different scenery, it's a nice change from all the boring gym backrounds.
Although it doesn't really seem like Claudia is straining herself at all (her weights seem like plastic, she seems like she's almost faking her effort)The repetitions are great and the music is soothing.
I would definitely recommend this video, in fact I just ordered the other 3 in the series.",1020297600,12,666,4.4227642276422765
724083,4,6303912729,"I mostly like this video and always feel like I've gotten a good ab workout. My complaint about it is that they pause and stretch in between every set of crunches.  This makes the tape pretty long, and lowers the overall intensity of the video. I would rather stretch at the beginning, do my sit ups, and then stretch at the end.",1018137600,,329,4.306451612903226
724084,4,6303912729,"After doing this workout, I did feel a burn in my upper body muscles the next day. The video itself is very ""artsy"" and mod, not your typical workout video. The moves are very basic and sometimes it looked like Claudia was feeling the burn, too. On some parts, though, it looks like she's losing her form and doesn't control her movements. Overall, it was a refreshing change from typical workout videos.",1016582400,,404,4.625
724085,4,6303912729,"Aside from the annoying artsy set and scenes of this video, Claudia Schiffer, with the help of Kathy Kaehler, does lead/teach several exercises for the biceps, triceps, deltoids, etc that actually provide quick results.
Between each exercise, there is about a 10-second preview of the next exercise (I use this time to stretch). Additionally, there are four sets of push-ups spread throughout the workout. One word of caution about the sets is Claudia does every move too fast! I perform my reps slowly and get better results so I am usually about 3 reps behind Claudia. I would not recommend trying to keep up with her; performing reps that quickly sacrifices form and movement.
I have a hard time believing that Claudia Schiffer actually does these exercises. I also don't like the implication that if one does these exercises, one will look like Claudia Schiffer. I would have much preferred having Kathy Kaehler lead the exercises (in some scenes the screen is split with Kathy and Claudia; Kathy has a much more realistic body).

My first impression when seeing these at a store was that I would want to slap Caudia and really not get an effective workout. However, after reading these reviews, I gave it a try, and I am really glad I did!  I always had big arms, no matter what kind of shape I was in or workout or sport I was doing, so I really wanted to target my arms, and this video is really working for me.  At first, I couldn't even do all of the reps, which makes it a good challenge.  The video is also easy to follow and interesting.  After 2 weeks, I am starting to notice a difference.

No screaming, no loud music, no bouncing.  I personally don't like to sweat alot - I barely broke a sweat and, at first, thought I hadn't accomplished much . . . until the next morning.  I felt like I had been at the Gym for 1 1/2 hours.  This video really appeals to me because the 30 mins passes so quickly.  I was particularly impressed with the brief explanation concerning form and the goal of the exercise before each segment.",985651200,,585,4.178571428571429
724175,3,6303912729,"I was very impressed with this video because I did have doubts.  It turned out to be a great workout.  There are so many reps and by the end you have done 180 crunches.  The trainer Kathy Kaehler demonstrates the exercises really well and its easy to follow her, and listen to her.  The video is one that you will have to grow with, at first it might be a little challanging to keep up with all the reps.  The only two things I didn't like so much were Claudia doing the exercises, it didn't look correct, and the stretching breaks were too short.  I guess you have to pause the tape yourself if you want to hold a stretch position longer.  Overall I really enjoyed it and plan to use the tape five days a week.",983664000,,711,4.145985401459854
724176,5,6303912729,"This is a great workout for the upper body. I love the way that the push ups are in between each segment. I usually have a hard time completing the last set of push ups. Anyway, the workout is much more intense whenever you use heavy weights. I used 8 lb weights when I was doing this workout a couple of years ago. Would you believe that I still felt the pain in my arms the day after the workout!",979862400,,398,3.9875
724177,4,6303912729,"I thought this would be supermodel fluff, but it really is a great workout, since it was designed by celebrity trainer Kathy Kaehler.  The workout was a lot more challenging than I expected.  Using dumbells, Claudia (and a Kathy Kaehler voice-over) leads you through exercises for all the major muscle groups: biceps, triceps, shoulders, back...and each group of exercises is separated by some push-ups.  The video is artsy, with vocal music and interesting scenery, and the screen is split between Claudia and another person (Kathy?) doing a variation of the exercise.  As I mentioned, Kathy does a voice-over which gives instructions on how to properly stand, and she counts for you so you don't have to watch the screen while you're performing the exercises.  I think the workout could have been a little better, as far as a better explanation of the exercises, but other than that, the pace was good--not too fast, not too slow, and there was a good variety of exercises. I was sore the day after I did this the first time!",973814400,11,1027,4.8125
724178,5,6303912729,"First of all Claudia looked great and there's nothing better than a woman who takes the time to take care of herself.  This tape is perfect for those who want to tone up those awful, granny arms.  It is a great start to  getting in shape.  All of her tapes are wonderful.  I've enjoyed them all.",957484800,6,295,4.196428571428571
724179,2,6303912729,"The scenery is beautiful.  The artistry is creative. Claudia is beautiful, but she does not have very good form.  This is especially noticeable when they show Kathy doing the same moves. She is so much smoother.  I found  myself watching the little box with Kathy in it and was frustrated when  there was only Claudia doing the moves.  I was also hoping for a little  longer workout.  Tamilee Webb's Abs of Steel v. 1 is still the best I have  seen.",953164800,,449,4.444444444444445
724180,5,6303912729,"I have been using this video for over 2 years now and still find it an excellent ab workout-the best I've ever purchased! I have used this video prior to my wedding to tighten up my abs and it worked like a charm! It  doesn't feel like you've done 200 crunches. But at the end, when Kathy  Kahler tells you how many you've done, it makes you feel so strong! You  really feel like you've accomplished something and had a great workout. And  the results are visible within a few workouts. The pace is steady and  motivating. The music is nice and Claudia's voice is reassuring and never  rushed. You are giving a thorough explanation of how the move should be  done and streching and a cool down are nicely added for a safe workout.  Bravo! Can't wait to do this one again and again!",951523200,10,781,4.337931034482758
724181,5,6303912729,"I appreciate that Claudia is instructed by her trainer.  She doesn't yell at you and has no ego.  She takes her time and for a beginner like me it is refreshing.  I got all her videos from Wal-mart and have decided to quit  the health club.  When I can get through these, I will be in great shape.  Good going Claudia!  Thanks.",950227200,4,327,4.17741935483871
724182,5,6303912729,"I was so surprised to see even one bad review for this video.  THE CLAUDIA SCHIFFER AB VIDEO IS A SERIOUS WORKOUT!  It was surprising at first--I thought it would be supermodel fluff!  But if you are willing to invest  your time in this ab workout you WILL see serious results (STICK WITH  IT--DON'T GET DISCOURAGED).  When I first attempted to do the routine there  was no way I could finish it, but sore abs and all I did it again.  After a  few solid months of doing it my abs were in the best shape they had ever  been in!
The workout is broken down into segments...each getting a bit  harder, or so it seems.  This provided me with clearly-set goals--I would  try to add on a new set each week.  When I was able to do the entire tape  with relative ease I knew I had come a long way!
Before each segment  begins, Kathy, Claudia's personal trainer, shows how to do the move  correctly.  Then the segment begins...and Kathy counts aloud so that you  don't have to strain your neck to keep watching to see where you should  be...you can just follow the count and enjoy the music.
The only bad  point about this tape for me was the warm-up.  I felt it was boring, so I  would do my aerobic workout first so I was all warmed up, and I would skip  the intro!
I recommend all four tapes in this series.  They are the  perfect compliment to any aerobic routine!  (The music is great too.)
If  anyone has questions before they buy the tape, feel free to e-mail me!  I'd  be happy to help, I own all four tapes, and know them well!",949881600,37,1526,4.197916666666667
7854609,5,6303912729,"This tape is one of the reasons that I still own a VHS machine, but it's getting very frustrating and ever more difficult.  I join the others who've been wishing for years that this would go onto DVD or Amazon Prime ... I'd buy it immediately!!!  Please, please make it accessible beyond the life of an aging VHS tape.  It's too good a workout to lose.  So effective ... I've gained awesome toning and functional strength under the great guidance of Claudia and Kathy.  The workout stands the test of time, but the VHS sure won't.",1504310400,,530,4.479166666666667
