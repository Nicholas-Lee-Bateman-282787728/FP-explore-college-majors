8044566,3,B00074DXEO,We only bought this film because of Rebecca Holden.  She turned out to be the only one who knew how to act and her scenes were worth watching.  The rest of the film was a rambling train wreck with a lot of footage obviously used on a moving train for lack of a real plot.,1255478400,,271,3.909090909090909
