7982882,5,B00008G7J2,"No, it's not the American Ghost Hunters.  These dvds, (I've found only two so far but am looking for more), show some beautiful English landscapes and wonderful old buildings and interview some fascinating characters who tell great stories.  Not to mention the historical interest.  Smugglers, Romans, and highwaymem; it's just fun.

(One year later)... I bought another, (third), dvd of this show called ""The Priest And The Profesor"" and it was extraordinarily dumb.  Episodes vary.  One dvd I ordered hasn't even arrived.  But give the series a try. ;)",1194307200,,554,5.157303370786517
7982883,2,B00008G7J2,"I bought this DVD because I had heard complaints from the presenter of this show, Ian Cashmore, about the US version of the show, in which a paranormal investigation group investigates paranormal claims. In the UK version, there are NO investigations: the show is nothing but interviews with people who feel they have been haunted. While still interesting, I have read online that the US show 'bought the format' of the UK show, and expected something a little more... interesting. If you are checking out this show because you like the American Ghost Hunters: TAPS, then I recommended that you listen to their radio show instead. There are lots of shows like this on the Discovery channel, and unless you have problems sleeping you probably won't like this.",1156464000,13,758,4.9296875
