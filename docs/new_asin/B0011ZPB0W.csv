They're soon picked up by a man who is startled to learn that the glasses show him the future. He sees a woman whose face is torn apart, as if she had been in an accident; without the glasses, she looks fine. Moments later, she's struck by a passing car, her face disfigured in just the way he envisioned. The glasses allow him to see the imminent deaths of others.
