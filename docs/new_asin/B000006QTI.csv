7904950,5,B000006QTI,"My daughter escaped serious injury or death recently because she was driving a 1992 Volvo. She was hit hard on the passenger side by someone who ran a stop sign and the car was tipped over on to the driver's side. She had to be taken out through the windshield. She came away with only some neck and back trouble, but otherwise, not a scratch. Her Volvo really saved her, but her Volvo was totaled. She is replacing it with a 2000 Volvo.

7904951,5,B000006QTI,"I am an admitted Volvo fanatic, but I have also been a huge fan of the History Channel's Automobiles series. The research is comprehensive and is an intriguing chronology of the car company and its products. The only drawback to this particular documentary is its mid-90s release date, so the information on Volvo only extends to the 850 line (discontinued after the 1997 model year). But for anyone who has an old ""brick"" or loves the one they used to, this is a great video.",1121212800,2,476,4.6117647058823525
7904952,4,B000006QTI,"This video is a great movie to watch because it touches base with the history and designs of Volvo.  I'd buy this movie only if I were a true Volvo fan, and also if i weren't lacking sleep.  There are portions of this  video that are boring, but the overall show is excellent.",946598400,14,276,4.169811320754717
