1214111,5,B00000G0B6,"I remember reading that McCoy was the fastest man on the draw in Hollywood and was amazed to see him toss away the gun in this episode, which is just as thrilling as it would have been if he did carry a six shooter. Tim's rare magnetism carries the plot so well that you don't seem to remember any other name except his when the lights are turned on again.

1214114,3,B00000G0B6,"The title refers to the ""dead man's hand"" held by Wild Bill Hickok when he was gunned down during a poker game, and which plays an important part in this limply directed Western that fortunately stars the always poised Tim McCoy, whose piercing glances enfeeble his rivals in his portrayal of ""Gentleman"" Tim Madigan, an unethical gambler whose finer instincts cause him to assist a beleaguered Mexican family near the California/Nevada border.
