4208138,5,B003V6L8U6,"I finished all 6 episodes of this show in one weekend (which is unusual for me).  The behind-the-scenes action of the Big Apple Circus is fascinating.  The show doesn't spend too much time on any one person, so viewers get a broad view of the people behind the scenes, while still focusing enough on each person so that we feel we know them.  Satisfying, inspiring show.",1374883200,,370,4.575757575757576
4208139,4,B003V6L8U6,This is a great PBS series about the circus performers in the Big Apple Circus.  It's easy to sucked into their lives as traveling performers.,1370217600,,142,4.68
4208140,5,B003V6L8U6,"This is as entertaining and gripping as any other ""backstage drama"" movie or program you've ever seen.  This program devotes almost equal time to the crew and creative team as it does to the performers, and the program is that much more well-rounded and informative because of it.

This program examines circus life both for its glamour and for its warts.  It truly is a unique lifestyle for everyone involved and it makes them a VERY tight-knit family.  Most of us should be so lucky as to have a family like this.

Highly recommended program.  I watched all six episodes (running a total of just over 5.5 hours) in one sitting.  I just couldn't help myself:  I got caught up in the love of the lifestyle and the joy of this segment of showbiz.

Do whatever you have to do to watch this.",1335744000,,788,4.454545454545454
4208141,5,B003V6L8U6,An up close and personal look at the people who are in the world of circus. Great characters & lots of drama. Going to the circus will never be the same again!,1316131200,,159,4.0
4208142,5,B003V6L8U6,"I'm not going to get too wordy, but this documentary was so well done and so amazing!  It made me laugh & cry, but most of all it really inspired me.  Fantastic!",1300924800,,161,4.0
4208143,5,B003V6L8U6,I stumbled across this one night and became instantly hooked. My hubby got pulled in too. We loved it and was sad it was over. I really hope they do a Season 2!!,1298505600,,161,3.909090909090909
4208144,5,B003V6L8U6,"Whether you've ever been to a circus or not.  Whether you love the circus or not, this documentary is a gem that will leave you wanting more.  And more.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  From the first to the last frame, we are invited to participate vicariously in the lives of the troupe members both in and outside the big tent--which is to say, personally and professionally.

I continue to be haunted by some of the relationships and images, longing to know how lives have played out since...",1293840000,,502,4.595505617977528
4208145,5,B003V6L8U6,"As a college student, I frequently watch PBS documentaries to inform me about topics that I am writing papers on. When I was asked to make a presentation for my theatre class about the history of the circus in America, I was thrilled to see PBS had a program to fit my needs. I figured I would buy the series, watch a little bit of each episode and that would be it.

I was not expecting, however, to find the characters and plot so engaging. ""Circus"" follows the lives of Big Apple cast members as they prepare for their performance season. Of course the program features great tricks and stunts, but what makes it addicting is the development of the characters throughout the 6 episodes. You begin to care about these people as they struggle through a very difficult life style, and you feel proud when they accomplish great things on and off stage.""Circus"" has an element of ""reality show"" that makes it impossible to stop watching -- in a good way!

I would recommend this program to anyone - some parts may be a little to mature for young audiences, but I think that teens and adults alike will find elements in it that they really enjoy. Teens will enjoy the ""reality tv"" feel of it, the stunts, and the drama. Adults will really like the character development that makes this show so engaging!",1292284800,3,1300,4.527659574468085

4208147,4,B003V6L8U6,I really enjoy this one. All the drama about reality TV with very little of the sleaze factor.,1428105600,,94,4.277777777777778
4208148,5,B003V6L8U6,Gives a fascinating behind the scenes look at the wonderful Big Apple Circus.  Loved it!,1427328000,,88,4.866666666666666

4208156,4,B003V6L8U6,"I found this far more interesting than I expected. I've worked (behind the scenes) in theater and it was interesting so see how this was both a bit like that and very different in many ways too. I liked seeing the struggles and triumphs of the performers, staff, and crew. I was worried at first it was going to be a little to ""reality"" show personal-drama filled, but thankfully, I found that aspect pretty minor after the first episode and a half.

All in all, I think I found new respect for this art form.",1418342400,,509,4.3578947368421055
4208157,5,B003V6L8U6,Very well put together almost made you feel like you were part of the circus family.,1416787200,,84,4.3125
4208158,5,B003V6L8U6,"The entire Circus program was well done. I enjoyed learning about what goes on outside of the ring, getting to see how an annual show like this gets put together, & hearing first-hand from the performers, crew, & management their thoughts about being a part of the Big Apple Circus & life in general. I recommend it.",1412121600,,316,4.56140350877193

4208165,5,B003V6L8U6,"My review title pretty much says it all.  Be aware that there is strong language and some references to drugs and sex.  However, it is all part of the amazing story being told.  Highly recommended!",1403308800,,197,4.571428571428571
4208166,5,B003V6L8U6,I always wanted to more about this circus. from what I saw and heard! its a tough show to get into. I never hade a change to see it. but from this presentation. I would like to. I enjoyed. (thanks),1401148800,,197,3.95
4208167,5,B003V6L8U6,"There has always been a bit of mystery and magic about the circus.  This will show you where the real magic is, in the dedication of the people.  I just love Steve Smith, and Barry Lubbin, they are the definition of clown personified. A heart made of pure gold the size of Texas. All the clowns are amazing!(sorry don't catch all your names)  .",1400544000,,344,4.34375
4208168,4,B003V6L8U6,"It is an interesting look into a small, wholesome circus.  Not interesting enough to binge watch.  There is a nice cross section of characters.  The first couple of episodes included workers with fake names (in my day, ""Frenchy"" was the popular one we joked about which gave it some credibility.  It is at times suspenseful (will the act be cut--can they do those catches?) to keep it from being mundane.",1400284800,,404,4.728571428571429
4208169,5,B003V6L8U6,"Lovely, engaging, emotional and left me wanting to find out how each person was doing.
I do local circus work, these people are the very best.  It was inspiring to watch them.",1400198400,,175,4.46875
4208170,5,B003V6L8U6,"This documentary is an intimate look behind the scenes of the circus. All the people who make the show work together as a family more than a team. An amazing look at the hard work, talent and love that come together for our entertainment and as an example of human courage and inspiration. Loved the pace, dialogue, music and videography that combined to make this a viewing gem of worthwhile entertainment.",1399248000,,407,4.746478873239437
4208171,4,B003V6L8U6,It actually is a very enjoyable show. I like the people and I c the circus differently.  I recommend it,1396828800,,103,4.15

4208173,5,B003V6L8U6,"Excellent presentation on the reality of working in a circus. The series portrays the real life struggles and hardships of people dedicated to their profession, and helps dispels the myths that circus people somehow are different than anyone else. I highly recommend it.",1395964800,,270,5.3023255813953485
4208174,5,B003V6L8U6,I really liked these episodes. It is very interesting to see how the performers live and train for the circus. You will probably get hooked like I did and watch all the episodes.,1394150400,,178,4.424242424242424

4208176,5,B003V6L8U6,"I found this series fascinating, especially the animal trainers and flyers.  It was also interesting about the private lives of all the circus workers.",1392681600,,151,5.291666666666667
4208177,5,B003V6L8U6,This was interesting as well as informative.  Very well done in my opinion.  It got into the nitty gritty of working and performing for a circus - including the different personalities and problems of getting along in a very close atmosphere. I'd recommend it.,1392422400,,260,4.886363636363637
4208178,5,B003V6L8U6,A series that takes you behind the scene and shows the way the Big Apple Circus deals with day to day operation.,1392163200,,112,4.136363636363637

4208180,5,B003V6L8U6,"...to join the circus. Fascinating series about the Big Apple Circus featuring the founders,performers from generations of ""circus people"" and those trying to become part of the circus. I wish I had some of their talents. It made me want to run away from home and become part of this traveling group of talented artists.",1390089600,,320,4.836363636363636
4208181,5,B003V6L8U6,Fantastic series. A very well made feature of Big Apple Circus minus the excessive drama associated with other reality television.,1389744000,,130,5.55
4208182,5,B003V6L8U6,"I've watched this several times and really enjoy the behind-the-scenes work and interactions.  I went to the Big Apple Circus once and having watched this series really enhanced that experience, especially when I recognized some performers from the video.",1389139200,,255,5.538461538461538
4208183,4,B003V6L8U6,"When there is so much junk put out by ""reality"" show makers, this series gave me a huge appreciation for those workers who put their lives on hold, and sometimes in danger, for the sole purpose of entertaining their audiences.  Of course, they do it for the pay, and some for the experience of having been in a real circus.  What would be an intriguing follow-up would be, what is now happening to these people?
A good series; it became a little slow at times listening to the ""administration""/management perspective....",1388880000,,520,4.766666666666667
4208184,5,B003V6L8U6,"This documentary of life behind the Big Top is engaging, honest, and so enjoyable overall that I was sad there weren't many more episodes.  It made me want to see the Big Apple Circus in person, but this candid view of what it takes to put on the show was so much better than any circus could ever be.  The joys and sorrows of the performers were so real and so well captured that the episodes grabbed me and sucked me right in.  If you've ever wanted to run away and join the circus, watch this first!  Romance meets reality in this series.",1387152000,,541,4.223300970873787

4208186,3,B003V6L8U6,"Some wonderful bits, but a bit heavy on the psychodrama. Extraordinary production value for a documentary, veering, however, suspiciously close to ""reality"" television.",1385251200,,168,6.3478260869565215
4208187,5,B003V6L8U6,Must watch Great show... the circus in its greatest form hope there is another season!!! Real people and real stories!!!,1382745600,,120,5.05
4208188,4,B003V6L8U6,"I wish I could have seen the circus in person the year this documentary was made.  I would happily have bought a ticket.  Too bad they don't let the show run a couple of years.  They let the clown (dancing in the rain) and the clown who led the orchestra with children go. I hope they have found other jobs. Grandma is still there, and (s)he's a staple of The Big Apple Circus.  So much fun and talent!  I was interested to see how the people behind the scenes live, too.  The workers have a pitiful life that they make for themselves.  The show gives them lodging and food and a small salary.  Two of the women struck me as being very intelligent except in their choice of men.  If you like the circus and, for the most part, I do you will probably enjoy this series.",1381104000,,768,4.170068027210885
