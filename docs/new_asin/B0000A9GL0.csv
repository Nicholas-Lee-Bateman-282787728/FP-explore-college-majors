1904413,5,B0000A9GL0,Good story about a man learning kindness and responsibility by taking care of an abused racehorse.  Based on factual accounts of prisoners working with animals.,1098403200,2,160,5.4
1904414,5,B0000A9GL0,"I loved the movie came in great shape, Just what I wanted, Great to watch with my kids and husband",1379462400,,98,3.95
1904415,5,B0000A9GL0,"This is a neat movie, and quite true to real life. I started to watch it on tv, thinking I would switch channels after
a few minutes. I ended up watching the whole movie. I found it refreshing and uplifting without being sappy
or unrealistic in scope.",1378684800,,251,4.361702127659575
1904416,5,B0000A9GL0,I really liked the movie.  I had started watching I on one of the HBO channels and it only played one time. So I thought I would buy it.,1374883200,,136,3.689655172413793

1904418,5,B0000A9GL0,I really liked this movie for which I had modest expectations. It was very positive and uplifting but still real & not sugary or phony. The acting was very good across the board.,1274918400,,178,4.424242424242424
1904419,5,B0000A9GL0,"This movie is a good quality movie.  It has a very compelling theme of second chances and getting one's life straight and in order.  It does have I think two or three swear words in it, but other than that it is suitable for family viewing.  There is a light love story that's nicely done.  Casper Van Dien portrays a convict who has spent one/third of his life in and out of jail.  When faced with the reality of losing custody of his son he tries to improve himself by getting an equestrian certificate.  It is very touching how excited he gets when he is given the certificate.  It is like a made-for-tv movie, but then those are some of the best out there right now.  I do recommend this movie highly.",1214697600,3,705,4.287878787878788
1904420,4,B0000A9GL0,"This is a great movie for horselovers (of which I am one). The horse does not have a ""rotten temperament,"" as one reviewer put it, but was an abused/neglected Thoroughbred who had given up and was close to death when he and Eddie (van Dien) form a bond that saves both of their futures.

The movie is sentimental (which I don't necessarily consider a fault), and a little far-fetched in that winning one horse show would not in reality save anyone from financial ruin. Serious horse-showing (where the big money is) is extremely expensive and time-consuming.

That said, I still highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horses. I volunteer at a horse retirement farm, so I can relate to a lot of the things in this movie. I own a copy of this movie on VHS, and am going to order it on DVD. I've watched it several times (and will watch it again, I know) and I always enjoy it.",1212192000,5,883,4.411042944785276
1904421,5,B0000A9GL0,"i loved this movie.casper van dien's best work.(and believe me,if you've seen casper's movies,that's saying something.)

 A great bond between man and beast;A great-looking man and a great-looking beast; If you're into these kinds of movies,it's a must see.",1160092800,,257,5.564102564102564
1904422,3,B0000A9GL0,"Casper Van Dien plays Eddie Barton, an ex-convict who's trying to make a new life for himself and his young son. His talent lies in rehabilitating unruly horses that have been given up on, just as many people have given up on him. Eddie finds his greatest challenge in Big Spender, a stallion with a sweet tooth and a rotten temperament. Looks and feels like TV movie, but find for Casper fans.
