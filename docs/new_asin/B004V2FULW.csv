8442597,4,B004V2FULW,"The movie is simply great. Lalita Pawar plays an old poor lady who moves in to a ghetto. She gets in a fight with local goons Jayant and David. After some comical happenings the lady becomes the apple of their eye. Jayant and David play the best roles of their lives. Jayant is fantastic in the scene where he goes to ""Kalu Dada"" to extract Mem Didi's purse and threatens him saying ""Khuda Kasam hum Tumharee Badmasheeyon Se Bot Pareshan Aa Gaya Hai"". That's probably one of the best action scenes I have seen. Lalita Pawar gives an Oscar performance like Anari. Tanuja plays her real life character a total brat. Hrishida is a genius and this movie is speaks volumes of it. My favorite scene is the one where David and Jayant plan to beat up Lalita Pawar and Jayant says ""Tum Use Seat Pe Baithne Ko Kahna or hum use Seat Samet Bahar Phenk Dega"". Jayant was as great an actor as his son was. My other favorite scene is where Kalu Dada snatches Lalita Pawars purse and she screams in the street and the scene rolls into a dance sequence. That's 70 MM cinema for me. Great performance great music great message.",1305849600,,1109,4.414634146341464
