8173419,5,B00000ICDK,"Wow!  Sviatoslav Richter in 1964 videotaped in some amazing performances.  The compositions are Brahms Intermezzo Opus 116 #5, Prokofiev's second sonata and Ravel's Jeux D'eau and Alborada del Grazioso. Be aware that it's  in black and white, and the sound is only okay. Also, there's the usual  emphasis on the pianist's face rather than his hand work and/or pedalling.  In this case, is of no matter, this is one of the most thrilling videotapes  of a pianist you can ever hope to see.  It's spectacular to see Richter at  his zenith and his fingerwork, face and body language are really something  to behold. Grab it while you can.",954547200,43,634,4.796296296296297
