2509836,5,B000E8N5E6,"When I see this dvd releasing early at BestBuy, I quickly grab it without any research. I know Chris and her style of exercise. I tried her cardio part with my 7years old daughter. We had a blast time. I do sweated. I think this cardio is close to Beginner and Intermediate level. It's easy to follow her with moves. She s energic enough to brighten your day!  I love the idea of selection on cardio, upper and lower part. Her timing on each section is perfect for my busy schedule. I have her dvds of Move away, Yoga for dummies, 321, Belly, Butt and thigh.  I also got Abs advantage. I haven't try it. But has viewed it. She does give new exercises on this one. I read her Move away to lose book. Excellent way to keep in shape and have fun exercising.  Thanks to her and other fitness trainers that I start to want exercising everyday with dvds and other methods in the outdoor. It s way best than going to Curves for me.

2509867,5,B000E8N5E6,Terrific tape.  Varied work-outs and something for every work-out even if you are not feeling very energetic that day.,1422835200,,118,5.2105263157894735
2509868,5,B000E8N5E6,This is a great program.,1415145600,,24,4.0
2509869,5,B000E8N5E6,I like that I can chose which part of the body to work out first.  Or do the whole workout.,1398297600,,91,3.55
2509870,3,B000E8N5E6,"Although the tape is good I was under the impression ,from the cover as well as the written description, that the tape had a heavier emphasis on weight assisted training, which is what I was looking for.  It was light in that area but other areas I'm able to use.",1387497600,,263,4.26
2509871,4,B000E8N5E6,"I love Chris Freytag and have a number of the Prevention DVD's so did not hesitate to get this one.

There are five toning sections: total body, legs & butt, abs & lower back, arms & shoulders, and chest & upper back.  There are also two aerobic workouts (both of which are about 13 min each not including WU and CD), the toning segments are anywhere from 10 to 5 min. each.  These are the usual Prevention Chris Freytag workouts, they can be as hard or as easy as you wish according to how many pounds of weights you are using.  There are also 5 premixes (22 to 45 min ea) which you choose based upon your goals, i.e. weight loss, maintain, strength, etc.

There is no list that tells you which areas are targeted in each premix so it's try it and see and it will give you a different workout for each day of the week within these premixes.  Since I didn't try them, I'm assuming you could just do the Monday, skip the Tuesday and on do another day if you wish.  If you want to do your own premix, there is a menu of sorts where you can pick which section you want to do and what order you want to do them in but they don't flow seamlessly from one to the other.  Say you pick one of the cardio and abs & lower back.  The WU will run, then a little pause while the cardio is cued up, then the CD, then pause, next program cues up and so on.  I just walk in place during the pauses but it is a bit of a pain.

As with all Prevention DVDs there is a 2 or 3 min. commercial for the other DVDs in the beginning which you can not skip and just go to the root menu, another slight pain in rear.

I'm an intermediate to advanced level and these workouts give me a good enough workout that if I do a number of them at a time I do work up a sweat but according to my HRM don't burn a lot of calories.  Good for those days you just don't want to work too hard.",1376956800,,1851,3.9171122994652405
2509872,5,B000E8N5E6,"It is a great workout DVD, with clear instruction and modification for beginners. You can get a great workout in 30 minutes or more if you choose. The only thing that I don't like is there is not a clear 5 minute warm-up even though she states it. The workout starts off at a high pace and for me it is too much too soon in the workout, but once I get warmed up its great, Lots of Fun.",1366588800,,385,3.8860759493670884
2509873,2,B000E8N5E6,"I like Chris Freytag, but this DVD was a beginner level and I am at an intermediate level.  I returned the DVD.",1360454400,,111,4.045454545454546
2509874,4,B000E8N5E6,I have had this DVD for a few years now and once again cirlced back to it. I like the ability to select different workouts for my session. It gives me a good workout to make me feel like I have done some good and still have the ability to walk and function afterwards. I can set how  long a workout I want. Most muscle groups are activated and there is good cardio too.,1342310400,,369,3.9864864864864864
2509875,4,B000E8N5E6,"After Comcast cancelled Chris Fretag's on demand workouts, I searched for the perfect DVD to take its place.  I was drawn to this because of the ""Mix & Match"" feature.  The DVD contains two 20 minute cardio workouts, a warm up, a cool down, four targeted weight workouts and one total body strength segment.  Using mix & match you can program the DVD to automatically play any combination in any order.  Very useful whether time is a factor or you have plenty of time for your workout.",1340064000,,485,4.540229885057471
2509876,4,B000E8N5E6,"I bought this dvd years ago when I was at an intermediate level and wanted to save money on visiting a gym.  I used the ""Lose Weight"" program which has about a half hour of cardio (plus another 10 mins for warm up and cool down) every other day, and then cardio and toning on the in between days.  The last day is a day of rest.  This program got my heart pumping and made me sweat.  If I had extra energy and wanted a longer workout, I could create a customizable day that added on more exercise.  On the flip side if I was tired or pressed for time but didn't want to skip, I could just do a quick cardio session and be done in less than 30 mins (including warm up and cool down)

The other Pre-programed workouts on the DVD are:

Lose Weight
Get Firm
Improve Your Health
Flatten Your Belly
Slim your Hips and Thighs

Then life happened and I stopped exercising for a looooong time.  So I freed up some time and decided to get exercising again, with this DVD.  Since I hadn't exercised in awhile I chose the ""Improve Your Health"" program, and it is just right for building up my strength and endurance.  I do the beginner modifications that are shown and it gets my heart pumping, but it's not too hard that I just want to quit, or feel very sore afterwards.

I like the instructor, Chris Freytag.  She is positive, energetic, but not annoying.  Even though the prompts seem to go fast, she always repeats them and gives you a lead in so that after doing an circuit once or twice it is easy to follow along.

It also includes a bonus section that has 4 moves to strengthen knee muscles to prevent knee injury, which I think is a great idea.  I just wish that it was included in the mix and match menu, so that I could do the knee exercises every other day while I workout, otherwise I sometimes forget about them.

One problem I have is with the abdominal exercises.  I have a previous tailbone injury and because of this I cannot do all of the abdominal moves on the tape.  There are a lot of moves where you roll up and down from laying to a sitting position, and this is basically impossible for me without a lot of pain involved.  I just modify the exercise and do crunches or hold the position.  So fyi, if you have tailbone issues.

Otherwise, great dvd!  If you are an advanced exerciser, this dvd might not be enough of a challenge for you.",1331510400,,2350,4.2314606741573035
2509887,1,B000E8N5E6,"I love Chris Freytag's workouts. But this one really left me feeling totally disoriented. She moves from one move to another and they're not at all co-ordinated. Instead of focussing on my workout, I ended up focusing on keeping up with the moves. It's a horrible buy. I've done the workout over and over again hoping that it'll get smoother but this is just one piece of confusion for me. I won't recommend this dvd at all.",1322438400,,424,4.51948051948052
2509888,3,B000E8N5E6,"I love Chris Freytag's workouts but the cardio section of this one is lacking.  She does v-steps, grapevine, toe-tap lunges, etc and has good beginner modifications.  But, not enough repetitions of each, so consequently my heart rate never was elevated. She changes from one move to another too quickly and by the time I caught on to the next move - (hamstring curls, push-squats, etc.) she was changing to the next move.",1314057600,,421,4.833333333333333
2509889,1,B000E8N5E6,"I honestly thought I was going to fall asleep while I was doing this ""workout.""  It was boring and was not challenging in the least.  I'm not some superstar athlete or in great shape - I workout 3-4 times a week doing workout videos.  And this video did NOTHING for me.  It was boring, too easy, and the people that back up the sessions annoyed me - they were too perky and smily and didn't look like they were trying at all, which is a bad sign with a workout video - the people in the video should be working hard and be sweaty and tired by the end, too!  Overall, I would not recommend this for anyone who has worked out in any way.  It might be good for very beginner exercisers, just coming back after some sort of long lay-off, but otherwise, steer clear!

2509890,4,B000E8N5E6,"I'm 52 and did this and many others last year.  Now i'm having knee pain.  If you are younger, i recommend these faster paced workouts.  if you're my age, be careful.  I also did some interval walking outside.  Keep your knees in mind when you do fast workouts.",1256774400,2,261,4.354166666666667
2509891,4,B000E8N5E6,"Some of the Prevention/Chris Freytag workouts are geared toward beginners. This is one of them in my opinion, but it has a lot of variety and provides overall a good workout. I once thought I didn't like Chris, but over time I totally changed my view. In fact, I'm really hooked now. She is great and I love her workouts. Her more advanced DVDs are awesome and total fun.",1246838400,3,371,4.391304347826087
2509892,5,B000E8N5E6,I am a fan of Chris Freytag so when I saw this I thought I would try it. The DVD is in great condition and just what I needed. It allows me to customize my workouts and even provides a plan if I should want more structure. Chris is easy to follow and very motivating.,1241049600,,267,3.8727272727272726
2509893,5,B000E8N5E6,"This DVD is terrific!  I really enjoy using it, and go to it again and again, it's one of my favorites.

The menu fairly easy to navigate.  Just pick what you're focusing on: weight loss, get firm, etc. (there's several options to choose from).  Then it takes you to anouther menu where the days of the week are listed and the corrosponding workouts for each day.  Just click on the day you're on, and start your workout - easy!  This DVD got me exercising on Saturdays, which I never did before.  Most of the workouts run about 30 minutes, but some run up to 45 minutes with cardio and strength together.  The strength segments are each about 10 minutes long and focus on different body spots (upper-, lower-body, abs).  There is one full-body stength segment that is 10 minutes long, too.  There are two cardio segments, each about 13 minutes long.  Then the warm up and cool down are about 3 minutes long.  You can use the pre-programed workouts, or customize your own.  I mostly just used the ""Lose Weight"" workouts and the ""Get Firm"" ones.

This DVD is great for anyone looking to make fitness an everyday habit, or for someone just looking for something new to change up their routine.",1233014400,5,1191,4.556603773584905
2509894,5,B000E8N5E6,"Chris Freytag is great. I first bought her Belly, Butt & Thighs DVD, which gives great results, but I was ready for something new and that targeted more areas. I love the Personal Training. It has workouts set up for each day of the week, with one rest day, or you can choose which workouts you want to do for the day. It's great!",1222560000,,330,4.171875
2509895,2,B000E8N5E6,"I bought this DVD a month ago, and I'm sad to say that I'm already putting it on the bottom of my stack of aerobics DVDs.

I haven't done aerobics in years, but have come back to it when I remembered recently how much I used to like to do it.  And, in finally deciding to get serious about losing about 15 pounds, I need to drastically increase my cardio.  But I'm too broke to join a gym!

I was hoping that this would carry me through at least a few months, but I've done it twice and I'm already not feeling challenged.  I can be really clumsy and uncoordinated, but Freytag's aerobics combinations are a bit boring/uninspiring even for me.

Also, on the segments where she does work with free weights, she only does 7 reps for each exercise ONCE, and then moves on.  I know that this DVD is for beginners, and there are those who might find this challenging, but I was hoping that I picked some starter workouts that I could grow with and aspire to mastering.  This one just didn't fit the bill.",1219449600,4,999,4.276595744680851
2509896,5,B000E8N5E6,"I have numerous Prevention workout DVDs with Chris Freytag and I absolutely love her.  I have worked out with tapes for 9 years and have many, many exercise tapes and I honestly think Chris Freytag is one of the best instructors I have seen.  Each of her tapes are all different routines and moves, yet so fun to do.  I get a great workout each and every time and I am an advanced user.  She makes you feel the burn, yet she varies it enough that the time flies by and you enjoy the moves you are doing.
I just received this DVD in the mail yesterday and was excited to try it.  It was really great.  There are 4 different strength training segments (5 minutes each) that are split based on body parts.  Then there is also a 10 minute total body toner.  There are also 2 different cardio routines (13 minutes each) and of course the warm up and cool down.
I chose to do the 2 cardio routines and a few of the 5 minute strength training sessions.  It was so fun and she is so creative at coming up with new moves so you don't get bored.

Love it! I highly recommend everyone try this.  So fun and great workout!",1219104000,6,1110,4.140186915887851
2509909,5,B000E8N5E6,"This dvd is great!  I don't believe that is too hard to keep up with.  I do feel like it is in a good space between novice and experienced.  I haven't worked out in quite a bit but I was able to keep up with the routines okay.  Make sure you have a bottle of water ready because you are definitely going to need it!!  I don't normally do workout routines at home, I like walking or jogging outside.  I thought I'd try it and I am very pleased that I did.  The instructor is energetic and makes you (at least she made me) feel as if I was really in one of her classes.  Her energy translates through.  I especially love the fact that you can tailor the exercises to what it is that you need.  They even give you a weekly schedule if you choose to follow it.  Go get this dvd; I think you'll enjoy it.",1212710400,,799,3.9622641509433962

2509912,5,B000E8N5E6,"Good for a beginner or intermediate. You can mix and match the workouts or choose from preprogrammed workouts. There are 2 cardio segments, one is low impact, the other is more ""kickboxing"" flavor. The toning segments are split into different body parts, and there is a 10 minute full body toning segment. I like to do that one with one of the cardio segments for a quick 30 minute workout. It's great!",1191542400,8,402,4.597222222222222
2509913,1,B000E8N5E6,"I bought several exercise dvds from Amazon, knowing that some would be duds.  This one goes in that pile.

If you can follow what Chris Freytag is saying, it's probably great.  But I'm a real beginner. I can't possibly follow the spead-of-light jargon this woman spews.  The instructions sound something like this:  Okay, Neekerbreekers!  Mumble, mumble...right foot!  Two More!  Turn to the left!  Back foot! Dihydrogen monoxide!  Mumble, mumble. Heart's going. Gibblegabble!  Get those arms up!  Abs tight!

Hunh?

I haven't the faintest idea what she's telling me to do, nor does she stop to demonstrate anything, just plows on ahead.  I jogged along feeling annoyed and inferior.  Just the feeling I want from my personal training session.  Not.

If you can follow her instructions, this is probably a great dvd.  But if like me you think a ""grapevine"" is the gossip circuit or a yummy Greek appetizer...give this a miss.",1190073600,12,925,5.006622516556291

I wish to do longer sessions. I love this DVD because its also
aesthetic and beautiful.  The trainer is inspiring and I'd buy it again!",1189123200,6,396,4.3108108108108105
2509915,3,B000E8N5E6,"I liked the pre-programmed sections for target goals or that you could personalize the sections. The moves in the cardio and toning sections are very similar to what has been done before by Tamilee Webb. Are there only so many moves out there or can you come up with something fresh if you're going to the trouble to produce a new program? The instructor is pleasant enough, very muscular compared to her background people and provided a modified version (but used the wrong back-up person to do it). The warm-up was not long enough for stretches, the cardio spots A and B were OK but did not raise my heart rate a great deal (although I did break a sweat). The cool-down section was good because it presented some nice modified yoga stretches.

I think that more fitness DVDs should go this route so that you can change it up.  It kind of allows you to have a larger variety with one DVD.

I like to use this DVD when I don't have a lot of time to work out.  If I only have 30 min. I can fit it in and it works well.  However, with so few reps, I increased the weights that I use.",1155686400,6,495,3.701923076923077

Chris Freytag does a great job of keeping you motivated and upbeat while working out to her videos.  She also has two other women that workout with her, one does a lower impact for beginners, the other a higher impact for more advanced workouts - they do a great job!

I recently purchased her ""Walk to Fitness"" DVD and highly recommend this one.  If you are unable to get out of your house for a brisk walk, I would recommend this DVD.  There are three segements on walking - Accelerated, Strength Training and Cardio.  They all make you break a sweat, sometimes I combine two of them together and work out for an hour - gets my blood pumping and makes me feel great!

I also have the Express Workout: Dance It Off DVD w/ Jenifer Galardi, she also does a great job in getting your heart pumping.  Good dancing segments - good cardio workouts.  This DVD is a nice change from pumping iron and streching routines. It makes you feel really upbeat!

The key for me to staying is shape is doing a variety of workouts - whether following an instructor on a DVD, using an elliptical machine, using a trendmill, taking brisk walks outside, going to the gym, etc., etc.  Just keep moving - its great for your heart, as well as your looks!",1147651200,14,1320,4.368852459016393
2509937,2,B000E8N5E6,"I travel for work, so I often rely on fitness DVDs to help me stay in shape. I've only been working out seriously for a few months, and this DVD is definitely too easy for me.  There are 2 cardio workouts, 5 toning work outs, a warm up, a cool down, and an all over toning workout.  This seems great, but when you actually look at the details, you'll see that the cardio workouts are only 13 minutes each, and the toning workouts are only 5 minutes each. So when you actually look at the pre-set workouts (without warm up and cool down), you're only getting about 20 minutes of real exercise.

I would say this is a good DVD if you've never exercised or you are really out of shape.  But even if you've been exercising for a little while, you'll probably find it too easy.  I strongly recommend The method cardio bootcamp, or 10 minute solutions carb burner, or 10 minute solutions pilates.  All three of these videos will give you the ability to choose your workouts or combine smaller segments into a longer workout.

I've loved all of the other Prevention workouts and knew I'd love this too.  Chris Freytag leads again and does another superb job.  There are two aerobic routines and five targeted toning workouts.  The dvd is programmable so you can do them in any order and do as many or as little as you want.  That's a big plus so you don't get bored or pushed for time.  You can choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc.  If, for example, you pick that you need to lose weight, there is a six day week with the routines mapped out for you already.  That is so helpful.  The moves are all basic no frills moves, but they are effective.  The first cardio section is low impact and the second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just that little bit harder.  The body parts are all the ones you want to workout; arms, butt, abs and thighs.  All you really need for this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy.  This is so easy to do due to the programming, so there really is no excuse for not working out.  This can be done by practically anyone.
I also love how the other two girls exercising as well, aren't the kinds that yell and shout etc.  They are as professional as Chris.",1146268800,59,1314,4.158730158730159

Anyway, I tried to start with the toning segments and they just didn't do it for me.  Despite me being out of shape, the routine felt like it was for a beginner.  It's like each routine was a warm up with no follow through.",1424131200,,384,3.961038961038961
