8029180,1,B0002M5UGK,I rate this with one star because the cover is very misleading. It is not the animated version as I had anticipated. The version that I was hoping for was the animated version with depicted a little angle as you see on the cover above. What I received was a live version  that looked artificial. I donated the video to charity. So if you are looking for  the animated version don't be fooled by the cover  read closely.,1388016000,,419,4.346153846153846
8029181,5,B0002M5UGK,"(Review refers to Brentwood 2005 edition-Slipcase says ""2004"", but disc is stamped ""2005"")  This one is a must!  I've seen several VHS editions of the Johnny Whitaker 1969 classic, but the DVD blows them away.  I remember seeing this on the ""Hallmark Hall Of Fame"" several times, and it still wonderful.  Now, the opening scene has always been problematic-it has always looked slightly milky because it was shot on film and transferred to 2-inch videotape.  But once we get to heaven,(and studio shooting) everything is tack-sharp and looks great-it just won't look better than this.  By all means, grab this!",1134777600,2,609,5.04
