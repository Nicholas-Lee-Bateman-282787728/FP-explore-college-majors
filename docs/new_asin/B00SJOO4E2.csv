8698648,5,B00SJOO4E2,"More than 40 years of ministry has shown me the value of the big picture when reading the Bible.  Once the reader can place the events and teaching of the Bible into a overall framework, the true meaning of the Scriptures begin to become apparent.  The Bible Walk Through, as taught by Roger Safranek, has given the Church a great resource for Bible understanding.  This course will bring the listener to a deeper appreciation for the outworking of God's redemptive plan in history and  the message of God's grace in Jesus Christ available to the world.  Highly recommended.  Jim Mooberry",1425254400,,588,4.83
8698649,5,B00SJOO4E2,"The Bible Walk Through is a wonderfully useful tool to acquaint students with a comprehensive view of the Scriptures.  Beginning in Genesis where God's great covenant with Abraham is found and continuing through the history of the Old Testament to discover how the Almighty amplified that promise with three more awesome pledges dealing with the patriarch's claim to real estate, with his progeny, and with his material and spiritual blessings, the Walk Through pulls together such seemingly disparate passages as Matthew's account of the Last Supper, Paul's teaching concerning the church, and John's visions of the end times.  I highly recommend this comprehensive Bible study.",1422662400,,679,5.457142857142857
