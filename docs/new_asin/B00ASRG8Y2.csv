8656208,5,B00ASRG8Y2,"I always wanted to make jewelry but felt a little intimidated and never knew quite where to begin. Well, I bought Connie Shaw's Simple Jewelry Series.  I just watched ""Design Concepts for Beginning Jewelers"" and I'm so glad I did! Connie Shaw talks through basic color concepts and how to apply them to jewelry making.  I felt like I was at her workshop class (you can even download a worksheet and work along with the class). Watching other beginners was a real encouragement... I'm inspired, I can do this too!  I'm looking forward to the next DVD.",1358380800,2,550,4.649484536082475
