Since the first PG-13/UNRATED version came out, this version, i.e. the R version-shows it like it should be-Blood and Guts! Action-a Roller Coaster Ride to Hell 'n back! Fun as all hell!

3122885,5,B001451HXO,"I don't know where you stand, but I want as much AvP as I can get.  I enjoyed every Predator and Alien flick and loved most of them then they brought the two great franchises together.  Watching AvP in the local theater, you would have thought you were at a WWE match.  It was a blast!  My only regret is that there aren't more.  I think viewers especially professional reviewers get stuck into analyzing movies too deeply and not treating them like a ride.

It's hard to tell a great story, but sometimes you have great characters and it's enough. The AvP franchise has solid characters in the Aliens and Predators and sometimes their food/prey (humans) can be good.  But for the experience of great alien on alien action, there's no substitute for these movies.",1413072000,2,763,4.607407407407408

3122918,5,B001451HXO,I may be one of the few people that really liked these movies.  Especially the first AVP.  The actors where almost all unknowns but that doesn't really matter.  The CGI and the action was spectacular.  And the story was really good.  The only thing I have to say about AVP-R is that they should have done some lighting correction.  It was like that in theaters and on DVD.  Those scenes are confusing.,1404086400,,401,4.486111111111111

Other movies of interest are Predators and Prometheus.",1401321600,,125,5.25
3122922,5,B001451HXO,"The Uncut Two Pack of these two films on blu-ray brings together two of films most violent species, Predator and Alien in an all out battle of bad vs. worse.
In the first movie, we have a team of scientists on Antarctica, led by Bishop from Weyland Industries to an underground pyramid found by thermal infrared, the problem of how to get down to it was solved by The Predators up in space who lasered a tunnel down to the pyramid.
They suddenly discover the tunnel that wasn't there before and they all make it down the tunnel to the pyramid, within the next few minutes, they then discover exactly what's up with this pyramid.
Mama Queen Alien wakes from her slumber and begins punching out eggs, and before long starts impregnating the human occupants, the Predators start appearing and the war is on.
One of the highlights of this film is the battle between Predator and Alien, it's somewhat epic, after all, it's what this movie is all about, right?
I give the technical edge to the Predators because they have the neat gadgets, while strength and the funkiest blood type go to the Alien.
Most of you have seen this movie so the funkiest Predalien ever born appears at the end of this movie, unfortunately, the poor predator who gave his life to give birth to it not withstanding.
The picture quality and sound was fantastic with this movie, I had no issues with it whatsoever.

That being said.....I approached the second movie REQUIEM, with trepidation because of all the negative reviews on this page about the visuals being so dark, it was unwatchable.
I have a 55"" Sharp LCD with a Bose Home Theater set up and I have to be honest with you, I don't know what these people are hemming and hawing about, okay, a lot of the film was done at night, in the rain and yeah, it was dark but that's usually what happens when the sun goes down.
Visually, I had absolutely no difficulty whatsoever watching this movie at all.
The only thing I can figure is the ones who said this film was unwatchable had DVD players and regular TVs without HD because then, I can see maybe that happening but my blu-ray copy was clear as a bell and I thought the movie was terrific as the battle between Alien and Predator moved to Earth and didn't waste any time kicking this movie into high gear.
Two humans are mated with facehuggers in the first five minutes or so and earth is already up the creek
And the Predators join in the ""fun"" but they're not here to be nice to the earthlings, they kill anyone or any Alien that gets in their way.
I really liked this movie despite everyone's opinion, which I found to be incredibly unfounded, there was nothing wrong with the sound, visual or even the movie itself, I thought it was a step up from the first one.
Good job!!",1401235200,,2753,4.451485148514852

A great addition to the Predator and Aliens series in our home.

Most other people have talked about the movie and it's quality.

3122946,4,B001451HXO,"As I said, avp 1 is way better. In fact it is great. Loved it.
Avp 2 is a bit lame and contrived.

For alien and predator fans, avp 1 is a must see. I think the idea/concept of bringing these two franchises together was brilliant. Avp 1 has a good plot and great action, thrills and visual appeal. A definite worthy watch.

Avp 2 story comes a little too close to normal life and so becomes obviously over the top. Over the top situations need to be handled very skilfully lest they appear ludicrous. It's a walk on the edge.

3122962,4,B001451HXO,"The product itself is what I'm reviewing... Generally, it bothers me when people review the movie other than the set (unless its an individual movie package... Then it makes more sense). Hopefully, you've seen these two movies before you buy them - because chances are that you'll find the first one ""entertaining, fun, but terrible"" and then the second one ""terrible, terrible, but a little bit of terrible fun"". I am not saying they're bad, because I watch them from time to time - simply out of the entertaining value of it where I get to escape for a couple of hours with absolutely no thinking whatsoever... What can I say, I enjoy some bad movies for odd reasons.

As for the product, as a boxed set itself - it's cheap, comes with a digital copy for the newer but worser (word in my book) of the two movies, and has a pretty wide range of special features. Basically, I got this to complete the collection. Alien Anthology (5/5), Predator Trilogy (2/5 due to price)... And of course Prometheus (5/5). Putting it all together on your shelf looks pretty impressive! So for that, neat cover art and individual packages make this a steal for the price.",1364256000,,1155,4.606796116504855

I hadn't been in a rush to watch them, since I remember the first movie as just being OK.  I hadn't seen AvsP 2, so I figured I might as well get the two-pack and watch them both together.  AvsP 1 was better than I remembered, so I was bit excited to finally see AvsP 2.

However, I found on trying to watch AvsP 2 that a duplicate copy of the AvsP 1 disc had been put in its case... This is truly disappointing.  :-(

Sadly I'm past my final return date by ten days. ""Return Window expired on January 31, 2013.""  And am now stuck with two copies of AvsP 1... it wasn't that bad, but I really don't need to own two copies.

The digital copy appears to be the right one but when trying to download the Windows Media Player copy it said your DRM is out of date and would not go any further without installing an update via a link they provided. I have all the updates so I figured it did not recognize the current versions. Then I tried iTunes and it once again told me I had to update to at least version 7.6. I'm running version 11. But it did seem to trigger iTunes into a redeem window. I typed in my code and it appears to have downloaded, though a bit quickly compared to other movies. Which probably explains why it says file can not be played. After digging around, there appeared to be no way to get it to download again. So back to fiddling with Windows Media Player on an older PC to discover what the ""DRM out of date"" message actually meant was you need a special plug-in to play it. So I finally got it downloaded and ready to play. I then moved my Veebeam over to the old PC so I could watch it on a decent size screen only to find the DRM blocks the video from the Veebeam. I tried installing on and streaming to the newer PC but of course DRM prevented that as well. At about this point my neighbor came home and I just borrowed his DVD copy to watch.

As far as the actual movie goes, it starts where AVP leaves off. It is pretty much more of the same. By that I mean more aliens and humans with a similar plot.

If you are expecting a level of depth and direction as from some other titles in the franchise you will be very sad indeed.

The Acting was almost okay, The Graphics and CG was done very well and all this alowed you to focus on the real stars of the film witch is the ""Creatures"".

Requiem:This movie takes places mostly at night or in dark places, I really think they went a bit far as to make it dark I think they went for a dark movie but it ended up looking like they were hiding something.

The cast in the movie needed some help with there acting but they did their part. The director should of focused on the real star; the monsters of this film. This movie focused way to much on the actors with almost sub par acting. (IMO)

The ending was odd and made me think a lot about what would happen if this hit my town In real life.  The ending I did feel was rushed while they did want to make room for I think another movie in the AVP universe.

I thought the story had merit as a standalone product sans the Comic Lore.  Paul W.S. Anderson did a good job moving the story along and the ending was good.

The second movie AvP Requiem, I also knew what I was getting and generally was not surprised by what I saw.  The only thing that did surprise me was how DARK this movie was from a lighting standpoint.  I did not remember it being like that when I saw the dvd version.  As other reviewers have said, it did diminish the movie enjoyment since it was very hard to see in some scenes what was going on.

When you are in Predator ""vision"" you can see pretty well but when they switch to an Alien it's nothing but a little slimy blob on your screen.  I have watched this on different tv's with the contrast turned up and down, the brightness adjusted but I still can't make out anything.

This movie was underexposed, maybe that was for effect but it really doesn't work when you can't see 50% of what is happening.  This really took away from my enjoyment of this movie.  The plot is about the Aliens and Predators coming to earth and having a battle here.  This was a great set up but the poorly lit scenes completely put a damper on this flick.

AVP itself is sub-par. Gone is the slithering suspense of the hideous aliens and the brutal savagery of the honorable Predator. Instead, we have a weird buddy scenario, with the Predator as the friendly side-kick and the Aliens declawed, no longer the horrific menace of their earlier films. The first one is a decent popcorn flick, worth a rental, but definitely not a purchase.

AVP: Requiem, however, is straight bad. The acting and dialogue are awful, the story is dull and predictable, Fans of the mythos will be upset by the liberties taken with the Predator-Alien hybrid. However, the action  and violence are better and the predator is much cooler, so that's gotta count for something, right?

All things considered they have come up with a story that works to bring the two classic creatures together to do battle in this fun action flick and it's sequel!

I love movies and appreciate great works of art in film. I also am not above loving a good popcorn flick! Movies are here for our enjoyment, but unfortunately, some people are so pompous they forget what it's all about! ....... entertainment! I'm not knocking world class films like Gone With The Wind, Citizen Kane, The Godfather etc..etc., but all films don't have to be so profound......do they?

This gimmick is no different than what was done in the 40's when classic films like 'Frankenstein' and 'The Bride Of Frankenstein' had sequels like 'Frankenstein meets the Wolfman'! Although it's not a classic, it's still a memorable and fun movie.

These films don't destroy what was great about the classics, they actually pay great respect...a homage if you will to the originals. If you don't like these films....fine, but for me I have to admit I enjoy them ...if done right. The unrated versions are the best versions I've seen and the first film edges out the sequel, mostly because you can see all the action!

I did not have the same problem some reviewers have stated about everything being in the dark(to be fair I do have a huge screen, it might make a difference??). Some scenes are dark, but I only had two scenes where I couldn't tell who was kicking who's butt! It only lasted for a few seconds each time.

Being a fan of the first film (I'm among the few probably) I highly enjoyed the 2nd one in that it really pays homage to the old Aliens and Predator films, lots of violence, much better creature FX than the first AVP film and just a truer representation of the Aliens and Predators really makes this a fun film to sit through, BUT something happened with the Blu-ray release of this film.  First the Unrated edition on Blu-ray is missing footage that the Unrated regular DVD has and 2nd, the movie is insanely dark.  Having seen this at the theater when it was released I know for a fact that the movie was NOT this dark, something must have happened in the transfer process but unless this movie is watched in total darkness its almost impossible to see A LOT of the film, even the HD trailer on the SAME DISC is brighter, clearer and easier to see.  I emailed FOX about these problems and I got a simple reply in that ""We are looking into this issue but do not have a solution yet""  So obviously there is a problem and I hope the institute an exchange.

Besides this the first AVP looks good, the visuals in Paul Anderson's films have always been great, whether you are a fan of his work is another story ;)

In either movie don't expect top notch performances from the human cast, neither movie is great on that front but I don't think you are watching these movies for oscar worthy performances anyhow.",1210550400,72,1503,4.443636363636363

3123050,3,B001451HXO,"First let me say that I have been a tremendous fan of the Sci-Fi Genre since the 50's.  The very nature of Sci-Fi is that what you are viewing is NOT REAL folks it is ALL FICTICIOUS (not factual).  This applies to a Sci-Fi Book as well as a Sci-Fi film.  Quite often people will prefer a book version over a film version (or visa versa) but in either case NONE of it is real.  I think too many people have taken the original poster to task and have been a bit too harsh.  Brent did an excellent job of rendering ""his"" opinion about the books and the films.  He has every right to render his opinions.  Obviously some people didn't like his opinions, but to even suggest that he doesn't have the right to post them is unfortunate.  I do have to take Amazon itself to task for constantly allowing reviews (good or bad) for products that aren't even out yet!  They do this with all forms of products and people begin to issue comments on things that aren't even out yet.  Yes, AVP2 was out in the movies but the Blu-Ray disc has yet to be released.  So right now everyone is commenting on something that doesn't even exist yet.  I do agree that comments about the quality of the disc would be most helpful but we can't possibly get that from anyone since no-one has the yet-to-be-released disc.  So to sum up . . . Brent, I very much appreciated your thoughts and thank you.  Amazon, you could avoid controversy like this by only making comments available once the product is actually available.  Finally, Sci-Fi is total fiction folks whether in book or movie form.  Enjoy it on any level you wish but always keep in mind that NONE of it is real.  Peace.",1207699200,13,1652,4.328990228013029
3123051,1,B001451HXO,"Let me begin this review by explaining to those who may not know, that there are a series of very well written AVP books. The central figure is a woman named Machiko Noguchi, who works for Weyland-Yutani Corporation. The series starts off on a colony world, and long story short, much like the original AVP movie, Machiko is blooded as a Predator warrior. But where the first AVP movie made an uninspiring choice, in the AVP books, Machiko joins the predators on their hunts across the galaxy, which makes for a gripping story with her internal conflicts between her loyalty to the predators, her hatred of the aliens, and her heritage as a human. They're really well done, and I highly recommend them:

1. Prey (Aliens Vs. Predator, Book 1)
2. Hunter's Planet (Aliens Vs. Predator, Book 2)
3. War (Aliens Vs. Predator, Book 3)

So, given this context, I found the first AVP movie to be by far the most closely aligned with this vision of AVP, although disappointing that it stopped short of carrying through with the theme described in the novels. Not surprisingly, I found the second AVP movie (requiem), to not only be an unfaithful extension of that theme and a complete deviation from previously understood Alien canon, but also an utter mess of a movie in general.

I would rank the Alien movies as follows:

1. Aliens (*****)
2. Alien (*****)
3. AVP 1 (***)
4. Alien 3 (**)
5. Alien Resurrection (**)
6. AVP Requiem (*)

To provide additional insight about my view of this movie, I own all previously released Alien movies, but have no intention of wasting my money on this one. Furthermore, after I'd finished viewing this movie at the theatre, I was actually incensed as I told myself that I'd just lost 101 minutes of my life that I could never get back.

Do yourself a favor - spend some quality time with a friend or family member, go out to a nice restaurant, or read a good book (such as those I've listed above), but DO NOT waste some of your precious time on this Earth watching this stinker.",1206316800,31,2008,4.563888888888889

Watching AvP in the local theater, you would have thought you were at a WWE match.  It was a blast!  My only regret is that there aren't more.  I think viewers especially professional reviewers get stuck into analyzing movies too deeply and not treating them like a ride.

It's hard to tell a great story, but sometimes you have great characters and it's enough.

3357419,5,B001451HXO,"The Uncut Two Pack of these two films on blu-ray brings together two of films most violent species, Predator and Alien in an all out battle of bad vs. worse.
In the first movie, we have a team of scientists on Antarctica, led by Bishop from Weyland Industries to an underground pyramid found by thermal infrared, the problem of how to get down to it was solved by The Predators up in space who lasered a tunnel down to the pyramid.
They suddenly discover the tunnel that wasn't there before and they all make it down the tunnel to the pyramid, within the next few minutes, they then discover exactly what's up with this pyramid.
Mama Queen Alien wakes from her slumber and begins punching out eggs, and before long starts impregnating the human occupants, the Predators start appearing and the war is on.
One of the highlights of this film is the battle between Predator and Alien, it's somewhat epic, after all, it's what this movie is all about, right?
I give the technical edge to the Predators because they have the neat gadgets, while strength and the funkiest blood type go to the Alien.
Most of you have seen this movie so the funkiest Predalien ever born appears at the end of this movie, unfortunately, the poor predator who gave his life to give birth to it not withstanding.
The picture quality and sound was fantastic with this movie, I had no issues with it whatsoever.

That being said.....I approached the second movie REQUIEM, with trepidation because of all the negative reviews on this page about the visuals being so dark, it was unwatchable.
I have a 55"" Sharp LCD with a Bose Home Theater set up and I have to be honest with you, I don't know what these people are hemming and hawing about, okay, a lot of the film was done at night, in the rain and yeah, it was dark but that's usually what happens when the sun goes down.
Visually, I had absolutely no difficulty whatsoever watching this movie at all.
The only thing I can figure is the ones who said this film was unwatchable had DVD players and regular TVs without HD because then, I can see maybe that happening but my blu-ray copy was clear as a bell and I thought the movie was terrific as the battle between Alien and Predator moved to Earth and didn't waste any time kicking this movie into high gear.
Two humans are mated with facehuggers in the first five minutes or so and earth is already up the creek
And the Predators join in the ""fun"" but they're not here to be nice to the earthlings, they kill anyone or any Alien that gets in their way.
I really liked this movie despite everyone's opinion, which I found to be incredibly unfounded, there was nothing wrong with the sound, visual or even the movie itself, I thought it was a step up from the first one.

Avp 2 is a bit lame and contrived.

For alien and predator fans, avp 1 is a must see. I think the idea/concept of bringing these two franchises together was brilliant. Avp 1 has a good plot and great action, thrills and visual appeal. A definite worthy watch.

Avp 2 story comes a little too close to normal life and so becomes obviously over the top. Over the top situations need to be handled very skilfully lest they appear ludicrous. It's a walk on the edge.

3357459,4,B001451HXO,"The product itself is what I'm reviewing... Generally, it bothers me when people review the movie other than the set (unless its an individual movie package... Then it makes more sense). Hopefully, you've seen these two movies before you buy them - because chances are that you'll find the first one ""entertaining, fun, but terrible"" and then the second one ""terrible, terrible, but a little bit of terrible fun"". I am not saying they're bad, because I watch them from time to time - simply out of the entertaining value of it where I get to escape for a couple of hours with absolutely no thinking whatsoever... What can I say, I enjoy some bad movies for odd reasons.

As for the product, as a boxed set itself - it's cheap, comes with a digital copy for the newer but worser (word in my book) of the two movies, and has a pretty wide range of special features. Basically, I got this to complete the collection. Alien Anthology (5/5), Predator Trilogy (2/5 due to price)... And of course Prometheus (5/5). Putting it all together on your shelf looks pretty impressive! So for that, neat cover art and individual packages make this a steal for the price.",1364256000,,1155,4.606796116504855

I hadn't been in a rush to watch them, since I remember the first movie as just being OK.  I hadn't seen AvsP 2, so I figured I might as well get the two-pack and watch them both together.  AvsP 1 was better than I remembered, so I was bit excited to finally see AvsP 2.

However, I found on trying to watch AvsP 2 that a duplicate copy of the AvsP 1 disc had been put in its case... This is truly disappointing.  :-(

Sadly I'm past my final return date by ten days. ""Return Window expired on January 31, 2013.""  And am now stuck with two copies of AvsP 1... it wasn't that bad, but I really don't need to own two copies.

i won't review each film because if your looking at this page you already know alot about the movies...

The digital copy appears to be the right one but when trying to download the Windows Media Player copy it said your DRM is out of date and would not go any further without installing an update via a link they provided. I have all the updates so I figured it did not recognize the current versions. Then I tried iTunes and it once again told me I had to update to at least version 7.6. I'm running version 11. But it did seem to trigger iTunes into a redeem window. I typed in my code and it appears to have downloaded, though a bit quickly compared to other movies. Which probably explains why it says file can not be played. After digging around, there appeared to be no way to get it to download again. So back to fiddling with Windows Media Player on an older PC to discover what the ""DRM out of date"" message actually meant was you need a special plug-in to play it. So I finally got it downloaded and ready to play. I then moved my Veebeam over to the old PC so I could watch it on a decent size screen only to find the DRM blocks the video from the Veebeam. I tried installing on and streaming to the newer PC but of course DRM prevented that as well. At about this point my neighbor came home and I just borrowed his DVD copy to watch.

As far as the actual movie goes, it starts where AVP leaves off. It is pretty much more of the same. By that I mean more aliens and humans with a similar plot. So if you liked the first one, you should like this one and vice versa.

If you are expecting a level of depth and direction as from some other titles in the franchise you will be very sad indeed.

The biggest gripe is one that I was expecting after reading similar reviews about Requiem. It is way too dark, I think they were trying to hide some lackluster special effcts and while effective it really becomes annoying if you are trying to see any kind of detail or gore from the fight scenes.",1351209600,,632,4.266666666666667

The Acting was almost okay, The Graphics and CG was done very well and all this alowed you to focus on the real stars of the film witch is the ""Creatures"".

Requiem:This movie takes places mostly at night or in dark places, I really think they went a bit far as to make it dark I think they went for a dark movie but it ended up looking like they were hiding something.

The cast in the movie needed some help with there acting but they did their part. The director should of focused on the real star; the monsters of this film. This movie focused way to much on the actors with almost sub par acting. (IMO)

The ending was odd and made me think a lot about what would happen if this hit my town In real life.  The ending I did feel was rushed while they did want to make room for I think another movie in the AVP universe.

I thought the story had merit as a standalone product sans the Comic Lore.  Paul W.S. Anderson did a good job moving the story along and the ending was good.

The second movie AvP Requiem, I also knew what I was getting and generally was not surprised by what I saw.  The only thing that did surprise me was how DARK this movie was from a lighting standpoint.  I did not remember it being like that when I saw the dvd version.  As other reviewers have said, it did diminish the movie enjoyment since it was very hard to see in some scenes what was going on.

When you are in Predator ""vision"" you can see pretty well but when they switch to an Alien it's nothing but a little slimy blob on your screen.  I have watched this on different tv's with the contrast turned up and down, the brightness adjusted but I still can't make out anything.

This movie was underexposed, maybe that was for effect but it really doesn't work when you can't see 50% of what is happening.  This really took away from my enjoyment of this movie.  The plot is about the Aliens and Predators coming to earth and having a battle here.  This was a great set up but the poorly lit scenes completely put a damper on this flick.

Please re-edit this thing and bring some details to the surface so that it can actually be seen and then I could rate this movie higher.  I really enjoy these movies but shot the way that it was it's impossible.",1264723200,,1128,4.273584905660377

AVP itself is sub-par. Gone is the slithering suspense of the hideous aliens and the brutal savagery of the honorable Predator. Instead, we have a weird buddy scenario, with the Predator as the friendly side-kick and the Aliens declawed, no longer the horrific menace of their earlier films. The first one is a decent popcorn flick, worth a rental, but definitely not a purchase.

AVP: Requiem, however, is straight bad. The acting and dialogue are awful, the story is dull and predictable, Fans of the mythos will be upset by the liberties taken with the Predator-Alien hybrid. However, the action  and violence are better and the predator is much cooler, so that's gotta count for something, right?

The transfers are great,but they should be, it's Blu-Ray baby!!!Note,it says Unrated two pack on the box which is most true, but the the original Theatrical/Rated cuts for BOTH films are also included along with the Unrated versions so there are actually 2 versions of each film(Theatrical/Rated and Unrated),very awesome!!! The fisrt film is a little short on extras but the second one is loaded,including a digital copy of AVP-R for your computer/Ipod(Digital Copy for AVP-R is in on it's own disc and has a code that expires on april,14,2009 just to lt you know) And I got this for less than the price of one,just $26.95 brand spanking new on sale right here at Amazon.com!!!,I buy all my Blu Ray's here,much better than the retail  stores prices(including Best Buy and Circuit City by the way)What a great deal!!!

3357530,4,B001451HXO,"I know that purist are not fond of what's been going on with their beloved Alien and Predator franchises, but truth be told these film aren't bad. All things considered they have come up with a story that works to bring the two classic creatures together to do battle in this fun action flick and it's sequel!

I love movies and appreciate great works of art in film. I also am not above loving a good popcorn flick! Movies are here for our enjoyment, but unfortunately, some people are so pompous they forget what it's all about! ....... entertainment! I'm not knocking world class films like Gone With The Wind, Citizen Kane, The Godfather etc..etc., but all films don't have to be so profound......do they?

This gimmick is no different than what was done in the 40's when classic films like 'Frankenstein' and 'The Bride Of Frankenstein' had sequels like 'Frankenstein meets the Wolfman'! Although it's not a classic, it's still a memorable and fun movie.

These films don't destroy what was great about the classics, they actually pay great respect...a homage if you will to the originals. If you don't like these films....fine, but for me I have to admit I enjoy them ...if done right. The unrated versions are the best versions I've seen and the first film edges out the sequel, mostly because you can see all the action!

I did not have the same problem some reviewers have stated about everything being in the dark(to be fair I do have a huge screen, it might make a difference??). Some scenes are dark, but I only had two scenes where I couldn't tell who was kicking who's butt! It only lasted for a few seconds each time. It could have been brighter, but it wasn't too distracting. Grab some popcorn and some beers and watch these Sci-Fi Battle Royals!",1213488000,10,1763,4.641025641025641

3357539,3,B001451HXO,"Having recently watched AVP Requiem on Bluray I ended up really disappointed with this version.  Being a fan of the first film (I'm among the few probably) I highly enjoyed the 2nd one in that it really pays homage to the old Aliens and Predator films, lots of violence, much better creature FX than the first AVP film and just a truer representation of the Aliens and Predators really makes this a fun film to sit through, BUT something happened with the Blu-ray release of this film.  First the Unrated edition on Blu-ray is missing footage that the Unrated regular DVD has and 2nd, the movie is insanely dark.  Having seen this at the theater when it was released I know for a fact that the movie was NOT this dark, something must have happened in the transfer process but unless this movie is watched in total darkness its almost impossible to see A LOT of the film, even the HD trailer on the SAME DISC is brighter, clearer and easier to see.  I emailed FOX about these problems and I got a simple reply in that ""We are looking into this issue but do not have a solution yet""  So obviously there is a problem and I hope the institute an exchange.

Besides this the first AVP looks good, the visuals in Paul Anderson's films have always been great, whether you are a fan of his work is another story ;)

In either movie don't expect top notch performances from the human cast, neither movie is great on that front but I don't think you are watching these movies for oscar worthy performances anyhow.",1210550400,72,1503,4.443636363636363

3357547,3,B001451HXO,"First let me say that I have been a tremendous fan of the Sci-Fi Genre since the 50's.  The very nature of Sci-Fi is that what you are viewing is NOT REAL folks it is ALL FICTICIOUS (not factual).  This applies to a Sci-Fi Book as well as a Sci-Fi film.  Quite often people will prefer a book version over a film version (or visa versa) but in either case NONE of it is real.  I think too many people have taken the original poster to task and have been a bit too harsh.  Brent did an excellent job of rendering ""his"" opinion about the books and the films.  He has every right to render his opinions.  Obviously some people didn't like his opinions, but to even suggest that he doesn't have the right to post them is unfortunate.  I do have to take Amazon itself to task for constantly allowing reviews (good or bad) for products that aren't even out yet!  They do this with all forms of products and people begin to issue comments on things that aren't even out yet.  Yes, AVP2 was out in the movies but the Blu-Ray disc has yet to be released.  So right now everyone is commenting on something that doesn't even exist yet.  I do agree that comments about the quality of the disc would be most helpful but we can't possibly get that from anyone since no-one has the yet-to-be-released disc.  So to sum up . . . Brent, I very much appreciated your thoughts and thank you.  Amazon, you could avoid controversy like this by only making comments available once the product is actually available.  Finally, Sci-Fi is total fiction folks whether in book or movie form.  Enjoy it on any level you wish but always keep in mind that NONE of it is real.  Peace.",1207699200,13,1652,4.328990228013029
3357548,1,B001451HXO,"Let me begin this review by explaining to those who may not know, that there are a series of very well written AVP books. The central figure is a woman named Machiko Noguchi, who works for Weyland-Yutani Corporation. The series starts off on a colony world, and long story short, much like the original AVP movie, Machiko is blooded as a Predator warrior. But where the first AVP movie made an uninspiring choice, in the AVP books, Machiko joins the predators on their hunts across the galaxy, which makes for a gripping story with her internal conflicts between her loyalty to the predators, her hatred of the aliens, and her heritage as a human. They're really well done, and I highly recommend them:

1. Prey (Aliens Vs. Predator, Book 1)
2. Hunter's Planet (Aliens Vs. Predator, Book 2)
3. War (Aliens Vs. Predator, Book 3)

So, given this context, I found the first AVP movie to be by far the most closely aligned with this vision of AVP, although disappointing that it stopped short of carrying through with the theme described in the novels. Not surprisingly, I found the second AVP movie (requiem), to not only be an unfaithful extension of that theme and a complete deviation from previously understood Alien canon, but also an utter mess of a movie in general.

I would rank the Alien movies as follows:

1. Aliens (*****)
2. Alien (*****)
3. AVP 1 (***)
4. Alien 3 (**)
5. Alien Resurrection (**)
6. AVP Requiem (*)

To provide additional insight about my view of this movie, I own all previously released Alien movies, but have no intention of wasting my money on this one. Furthermore, after I'd finished viewing this movie at the theatre, I was actually incensed as I told myself that I'd just lost 101 minutes of my life that I could never get back.

Do yourself a favor - spend some quality time with a friend or family member, go out to a nice restaurant, or read a good book (such as those I've listed above), but DO NOT waste some of your precious time on this Earth watching this stinker.",1206316800,31,2008,4.563888888888889

8254368,4,B001451HXO,"The main purppose of this review is not to discuss the merits or demerits of these movies, as they are older now and most ppl have seen them and have their own opinions. I liked the story, plot, and (human) characters better in AVP, but thought that the alien on predator action and sfx were better in AVPR. I recently bought this Blu-ray set and watched the films back-to-back. I do not remember my impressions of the visual or audio quality when I first saw the original versions when they were released on DVD years ago, but I did not have any of the ""too dark"" issues others have mentioned this time around. My setup up is a 42"" Panasonic plasma TV with a viewing distance of about 8' and a 5.1 surround sound system. I watched the movies at night in both total darkness and with minimal room lighting. AVPR is dark - intentionally so, as almost all of it occurs at night - but the movie was clear; I had no trouble discerning anything. As other reviewers have mentioned, perhaps the complaints about the darkness have more to do with viewers' setups than the movie, the medium, or the transfer process. Maybe it looks different on LCD or DVD. The audio was great on both movies, but particularly thunderous on AVPR. I got this set in used but excellent condition for $7, and I consider that money very well spent. Are they my fave movies? No. Did I enjoy them? Yes.
