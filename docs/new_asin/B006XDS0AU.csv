8506212,5,B006XDS0AU,"If you are an avid Salman Khan fan, as I am, this DVD is a ""MUST HAVE""! I believe that Salman is the greatest dancer of our time - the man can do it all -
suave, sophisticated, romantic, action, jazz, rap, and rock!  I have seen most of his movies and this DVD includes dance sequences from a good variety of his movies and they are fabulous - the quality is also excellent - sometimes better than the movie.  I am so glad that Mr. Gulshan Kumar put this compiliation together - it saves the viewer from fast fowarding
through all the movies to find favorite songs and dance sequences.  I wish Mr. Kumar would continue to compile the dance sequences from all Mr. Khan's movies -
especially the earlier ones.  His expertise and style in dance deserves to be preserved for posterity.  There is an interesting and rousing song/dance sequence entitled ""Hindustani"" from
the movie ""Dus"" which was never completed - one wishes there was more footage from this movie.  The various movies include: Partner, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Tere Naam,
Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (two personal favorites), Chal Mere Bhai, etc.  I have thoroughly enjoyed every selection on this DVD over and over
and cannot give it any higher recommendation!  It's the greatest!",1328918400,4,1256,4.677272727272728
