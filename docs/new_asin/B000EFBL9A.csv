Ricky provides a goodly number of wonderful why-didn't-I-think-of-that techniques for getting creative with quilt design and construction. I love his ideas for getting smooth curves without pins. But his improvisational techniques are the best. So freeing! This DVD is professionally produced and I found it incredibly easy to follow all the techniques. I didn't think I was a visual learner (leaning much more toward books), until I started watching quilting DVDs. But my mind was changed by this one and it's follow-up covering quilting and finishing techniques:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ricky-Tims-Presents-Grand-Finale-Fine-Machine-Quilting-and-Finishing-Techniques/dp/B000EFBK8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ricky Tims Presents Grand Finale: Fine Machine Quilting and Finishing Techniques</a>. And now he has yet another DVD out on quilting, which I think is totally amazing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ricky-Tims-Kool-Kaleidoscope/dp/B001E4EV7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ricky Tims Kool Kaleidoscope</a>.",1206057600,5,1191,7.63768115942029

I think I would have gotten more use out of a book vs. the DVD.",1191628800,4,190,4.135135135135135
