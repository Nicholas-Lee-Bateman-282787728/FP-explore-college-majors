5851779,5,B00DS79HCE,"I was provided a DVD Version of the Dreamworks Holiday Collection for review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.

My girls (ages 3 and 6) love all of the Dreamworks movies with the Madagascar movies being their favorites.  We watch a lot of Christmas shows and movies during the holidays and this is a great set to add to the rotation.  It has four fun Holiday Specials that include the biggest Dreamworks characters.  The quality of the episodes are standard DVD quality.  The shows are all in Widescreen format and look very good for a DVD.  Unfortunately, there are several commercials at the beginning of the DVDs, but they can be easily skipped.

Included in the DVD version of this set are the following four holiday specials:
1. Shrek The Halls
2. Merry Madagascar
3. Dragons Holiday - Gift of the Night Fury
4. Kung Fu Panda Holiday

Overall, it is a great set of new Christmas Shows with good DVD quality.  The is great to have all of your favorite Dreamworks characters in Holiday themed specials in one place whenever you want to watch them.  If you love watching Holiday shows and movies like my family does and like the Dreamworks characters, this is a really nice set to have around for the holidays.",1383091200,,1248,4.53125
5851780,5,B00DS79HCE,"Every year at Christmastime, there are a few ""holiday"" DVDs released for kids that are charming, cute, and timely... but SHORT!  (Less than 30 minutes long; perhaps crafted to fit into a 30-minute time slot on TV.)  More than a few times, I've caught myself grumbling as I paid ""full price"" for a new DVD where the ""main feature"" (the only part that I, or the grandkids, cared about) was only, say, 22 minutes long.

This package is one solution: with four of the most popular ""recent"" specials bundled in one package, it's a much more ""cost-effective"" way of adding these gems (which appeal to ADULTS, as well as kids) to your DVD/Blu-Ray collection. And if you haven't seen them before, these are actual, plotted STORIES. (Not one of those ""cheap music videos disguised as feature presentations"" that are sometimes put out.) Each DVD is packed with ""Extras,"" as well.

One caution: Only Shrek and Madagascar are about Christmas; ""Kung Fu Panda"" concerns the annual Winter Feast, and ""Dragons"" is about the Viking winter holiday.  That's why this is a ""Holiday"" collection, rather than a ""Christmas"" collection.  (But celebrants of the Winter Solstice may much PREFER it this way!)

If you want a more ""traditional"" collection of holiday features for ""kids"" (of ALL ages, including adults!), you might want to check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Original-Christmas-Classics-Gift-Set/dp/B0057FGCJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Original Christmas Classics Gift Set</a>.",1382918400,,1523,5.595652173913043
5851781,5,B00DS79HCE,"Call that trite, but I'm in my 70s, and my grandkids are 5 and 7, and this Dreamworks Holiday Collection IS an enjoyable feast for ... well, at least 5 to 70. Though sold with all the trappings of a Christmas special, these four Dreamworks tales are for any time of year though they might fit in best with the winter holidays.

I enjoyed all the originals (Shrek 1, but no others in the franchise) - Madagascar, How to Train Your Dragon, Kung Fu Panda, and Shrek - but some of these I found even better. It's as though Dreamworks put an extra effort into these because they're shorter and had to be packed with marvelous animation, a few inside jokes, and great ""little"" stories. My favorite was Kung Fu Panda Holiday which combines elements of Oscar ceremonies with the Greatest Chef (or whatever the cooking contest show is called). It's fun, funny, and beautifully drawn and draws you in to give its rather sweet message. They all have a similar message, but told in such a way so that they could easily become holiday classics. They will never replace the 1947 ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" but they should be added as part of a Christmas tradition.

The Dreamworks Holiday Collection was given to me to review along with The Original Christmas Classics. Sorry but the ""Originals"" pale in comparison: These will last, but the ""classics"" including Rudolph will fade in time.",1382832000,4,1373,4.669421487603306

This 2 DVD set has actually four   hours TV specials staring the various stars of the Dreamwork's popular characters like Shrek, the Madagascar Animals, Kungfu Panda and the Dragons.  If you have children then like me you will immediately know who these characters are as you know them by heart after watching all of their films

These are four great holiday classics that are presented by the best animated film company today. You will enjoy them with your children this holiday season.  This set makes a great gift for friends and family and you will have hours of fun watching them with your kids.  Just be prepared to watch them multiple times.  Regardless of whether you are soaring with the dragons or laughing at the antics of the penguins you will love these stories.

Each of these shows are short as they are made from TV specials.  They are:
* Shrek the Halls is 28 minutes and 24 seconds long
* Gift of the Night Fury  is 22 minutes and 37 seconds long
* Merry Madagascar is 22 minutes and 44 seconds long
* Kungfu Panda is 26 minutes and 7 seconds long

These shows are beautifully mastered and the animation is simply spectacular.  This set makes a great Christmas stocking stuffer or as an early gift just to get the kids into the holiday spirit.  This is a 5 star product.

I received a sample product for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.",1382745600,27,1901,5.621052631578947
5851783,5,B00DS79HCE,"My family really did enjoy the ""Dreamworks Holiday Collection.""  My nine and twelve year-olds give it five stars.  It's two DVD's containing four short movies and a slew of extras like deleted scenes, games, and music videos.

The family favorite is the Shrek video, which is good enough to be the newest Christmas classic.  There's lots of humor for young and old and the best storyline to underline the true meaning of Christmas - our family and friends.

My least favorite is ""Merry Madagascar,"" because it doesn't have the depth of story as much as the others.  My children enjoyed the physical humor, though.

None of videos feature a strong religious theme.  It's more Santa or holiday.  This can be good or bad depending on which way you lean, but just keep that in mind.

Children will enjoy it.  Young children may have trouble operating the remote for the extras.  They might really like it, so show it to them only if you don't mind babysitting the remote.  I only wish the scenes would advance on their own, with chapters included if we want to skip to certain sections.  I guess that wouldn't work for the games, but it would be great for everything else.

Below is a brief synopsis of each video:

KUNG FU PANDA HOLIDAY

Po is set to share the holiday with his father, but his master appoints him the host of the holiday dinner for the great masters.  Po comes up with a plan to have his father join him, but all doesn't go as planned.

MERRY MADAGASCAR

Santa finds himself in Madagascar with amnesia and our animal friends must deliver his presents.

DRAGONS HOLIDAY

The dragons all disappear around the holiday and no one knows how to celebrate without them.  Just where did they go?  Hiccup finds out and it's a special surprise.

SHREK THE HALLS

It's Shrek's first Christmas with his family and he's not quite sure how to do it right.  When friends barge in, it's pandemonium until he learns what Christmas is really all about.

5851784,5,B00DS79HCE,"This collection features four half hour holiday specials from DreamWorks featuring their franchise characters.  Somehow, I had missed all but one of them when they aired on TV, but I was happy to catch up with them here.

First, a complaint.  This DVD set (and it appears to only be available on DVD) is two discs.  Each disc contains two half hour specials.  Why these couldn't have all been put on one disc is beyond me.

Now that weve got that out of the way, lets look at the specials themselves.  The first disc contains the two that are definitely Christmas specials.  Merry Madagascar finds the zoo animals of that franchise hoping to make it home by Christmas.  When their plans are thwarted and they accidentally shoot down Santa, they have to step in and deliver the presents to save Christmas.  Im not a huge fan of this franchise (having only seen the first movie), so I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this special.

Up next is Shrek the Halls which finds our favorite ogre trying to put together the perfect Christmas for his family  a task complicated by the fact that he hasn't celebrated the holiday before.  Add in help from his friends and youve got a recipe for comedic disaster.  This is the only one I had seen before, and the bathroom humor was a bit over the top, even for this franchise, but on the whole this one is fun, too.

The second disc talks about winter holidays that aren't Christmas, which actually works for the settings of the stories.  Kung Fu Panda Holiday finds Po, as the dragon warrior, responsible for a super complicated holiday feast for all the Kung Fu legends when what he really wants to do is help his father put on the annual feast for those without family in the village.  The lesson is obvious early on, but there is plenty of fun getting there.

Finally comes Dragon Holiday: Gift of the Night Fury.  As the characters from How to Train Your Dragon get ready for their first winter holiday with dragons, they are upset to find all their dragons flying away.  Meanwhile, Hiccup works to come up with a special gift for Toothless.  There were some great gags here and I found the resulting story very touching.

But we aren't done yet.  There are bonus features as well.  Most of the ones one the first disc are spoofs on classic Christmas songs with characters from Madagascar, usually the penguins, involved.  Disc two, however, features some fun animation involving training the various dragons as well as how to draw some characters.  Again, it is more dragon focused, although we do get a feature on how noodles are made to tie into Kung Fu Panda.

On the whole, this set is fun and worth getting to enjoy at Christmas time.  The four specials are heartwarming and feature characters that todays kids will love.  These may just be the specials they look back at fondly when they grow up, and thats okay in my book.

NOTE: I received this set in exchange for my honest review.",1382313600,,2947,4.558095238095238
5851785,5,B00DS79HCE,"I was unfamiliar with the stories and, with the exception of Shrek, unfamiliar with the characters in these four specials (my familiarity with holiday specials tends to center around Charlie Brown). So, to give this a good real-world test, I brought it with me to a friends house who has kids. Big hit!

There are four specials on two disks: Kung Fu Panda Holiday, Merry Madagascar, Dragons Holiday and Shrek the Halls. Of the four, the kids seemed to like Merry Madagascar the most. I found Shrek the Halls the most enjoyable, but that may be due to the fact that I was familiar with the characters and overall story line.

But even if you're a Charlie Brown fan, there's fun to be had with this collection of specials. The animation is excellent, as are the overall production values. Both disks have extras that are also entertaining, especially (for me at least) the ones on disk 2.

5851786,5,B00DS79HCE,"Are you looking for some holiday movies to watch with your kids and grandkids, but somehow they don't want to watch the old ones YOU have in your collection? This nice collection offers a set of four contemporary holiday videos. It comes with two disks, two movies per disk and are in a very nice holiday package.

Kung Fu Panda Holiday (2010) 25 minutes - This intriguing video featuring ""Po,"" is a story about the meaning of honor and family as Po is assigned the job of preparing the annual winter feast at the Jade Palace. When his father refuses to cook for the event, Po tries to do the job himself. Things go downhill until Po sorts out his priorities, and everyone discovers that family and fun are more important than perfection and ritual.

Merry Madagascar (2009) 22 minutes - This fun story involving the Madagascar characters has Alex shooting down the ""red Goblin"" only to discover that he actually shot down Santa Claus - who was throwing coal at them for being naughty this year. Santa has amnesia, and the animals attempt (with massive difficulties) to deliver the packages for Santa. Emphasis on Naughty and Nice lists for Santa as well as the old-fashioned sticks and coal.

Dragons Holiday (2011) 22 minutes - When all of the dragons disappear from the island (except Toothless because he can't fly alone), Hiccup fixes a prosthetic tail for him giving him the freedom to fly alone and he also disappears. Hiccup searches for Toothless and ends up leading all of the dragons home from their migration to bear children on an island, when they return they bring their babies with them.

Shrek the Halls (2007) 28 minutes - Ogres don't celebrate anything - so when Shrek tries to create the perfect Christmas Eve for Fiona, he begins by reading a book called ""Christmas for Village idiots."" In typical fashion, nothing goes right, especially when Donkey shows up with everyone ruining Shrek's plans for a quiet Christmas with his family. It gets really funny (at least for kids) when the different animals begin telling their stories of ""A Visit from St. Nicholas,"" culminating with an argument over whether Santa really ate Gingy's girlfriend Suzy. After much confusion, the friends reunite and eventually listen to the story featuring ""Ogre Claus.""

I received a complimentary set of these videos to watch for my review. Since I had never seen any of these before, it made for a fun time - I'm looking forward to the holiday season when I can watch them with my granddaughter as well.",1382054400,,2503,4.771362586605081
5851787,5,B00DS79HCE,"This 2 DVD set is a great idea for a family Christmas gift - or rather family Holiday gift. Dreamworks makes fine animated features as we all know but there may be many families out there who have not had the opportunity to see these takeoffs on original ideas that are just terrific to welcome in the holiday season. Not only are the stories well written clever, but the added advantage of have famous Hollywood stars such as Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas and more enter your living room as the voices of these fun characters makes the entertainment even better.

There are four stories based on movie successes re-crafted into television specials for the holidays, so even though the characters on the colorful packaging set look familiar, the stories are fresh. The works included here are Shrek the Halls from 2007,  Merry Madagascar from 2009, Kung Fu Panda Holiday from 2010 and Gift of the Night Fury (based on How to Train Your Dragon) from 2011. In addition to the four stories there are some surprise little specials on each DVD. Children will probably know these characters and situations better than adults so the memory lone can reverse a bit here. But sit with the entire family and watch them all and fin a new outlook on the holidays.

This is another excellent holiday gift for families - but think about sending it early December to start the holiday sensation and goodwill early. Grady Harp, October 13",1381968000,6,1448,4.760956175298805
5851788,5,B00DS79HCE,"My daughter and I totally enjoyed watching this holiday collection in anticipation of our favorite time of the year! 91 minutes of animated movies, with bonus how-to, games and shorts, can be found on the Dreamworks Holiday Collection 2-DVD set.

Movies have been formatted to work with both full-screen and widescreens, thus look great on both older and newer TVs.  Black bars on top/side are normal for widescreen viewing on some TV's (we didn't notice it on our widescreen HDTV).  English, French and Spanish versions are available on each disc.

Disc 1:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek-the-Halls/dp/B001AQT112/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek the Halls</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merry-Madagascar/dp/B002XODB66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merry Madagascar</a>.  These two were definitely my favorites! Geared towards the whole family, but with subtle humor adults will appreciate.

Both mention 'Christmas' and 'Santa', staying true to their box-office hit movie characters and overall themes. (See links to specific movies for reviews of them.)

Disc 2:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragons-Holiday-Gift-of-the-Night-Fury/dp/B00DS79HHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragons Holiday-Gift of the Night Fury</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Fu-Panda-Holiday/dp/B008VNIAQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Fu Panda Holiday</a>.  This disc was more 'holiday' related, and less specific to Christmas and Santa.  Again, each movie is true to the original in characters and theme, and both movies have been extensively reviewed, so click their names to see more on each film.

The DVD quality is excellent in this set (1080i on my older plasma HDTV using an upscaling DVD player), and the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound through my home theater speakers was great.

This 2-disc DVD set is the perfect way to enjoy all four of these films at the right price!  Nice bonus content that parents will love to share with their children, makes this an even better deal than purchasing each movie separately.  I highly recommend picking this set to add to your holiday video library, to be enjoyed for years to come by kids and adults alike.

5851806,4,B00DS79HCE,"The DREAMWORKS HOLIDAY COLLECTION is a two-disc set containing four Christmas or winter holiday themed shorts. The animation in the shorts is top-notch and each of the shorts is notable for having the original actors from the movies voicing the characters in the shorts. The first disc includes: MERRY MADAGASCAR and SHREK THE HALLS. The second disc includes DRAGONS HOLIDAY: GIFT OF THE NIGHT FURY and KUNG FU PANDA HOLIDAY.

MERRY MADAGASCAR is set after the events of MADAGASCAR but before the events of MADAGASCAR 2. On Madagascar, its Christmas Eve and Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman have made a hot air balloon and are almost off the island when they are shot down by King Julian and his Lemur subjects. Julian mistook the four friends and their balloon for the red night goblin; a mysterious being who appears every year on the 24th of Julianuary and showers the island full of coal. Shortly after, the red night goblin does appear and thanks to the prowess and aim of Alex, hes shot out of the sky. As it turns out this goblin is really a giant elf named Santa. When he awakens he has amnesia and abandons his sleigh and reindeer. The reindeer are Russian and hate the penguins (who are from the South Pole). So, its left up to Alex and the gang to deliver all the presents left in the sleigh and save Christmas.

Ive seen a lot of modern animated Christmas specials and I have to say that although not original, MERRY MADAGASCAR is one of the better modern animated Christmas specials I have seen. It not only fits in with the style of the original MADAGASCAR movie, but it also feels like a usual tv Christmas special.

SHREK THE HALLS is a Christmas special takes place after the events of SHREK THE THIRD. Shrek and Fiona are happily raising their babies, but Donkey keeps bugging Shrek about getting ready for Christmas. Shrek has never celebrated Christmas before and doesnt plan on doing so until he finds out Fiona is looking forward to it and Shrek unexpectedly promises Fiona a Christmas surprise. Shrek races into town on Christmas Eve to get a book from the book seller to find out what Christmas is about and then sets out to make a wonderful family Christmas for Fiona and the kids. However, he informs Donkey of his plans and son Donkey and many of the other fairy tale creatures that are a part of Shreks extended family invade their home for a Christmas party. A time of storytelling and mayhem ensues.

The animation is good and the vocal talents from the Shrek movies do the voices of their respective characters. However, I didn't find the special to be as funny or entertaining as some of the other Shrek specials. I was also discouraged that the special didn't focus much on the giving aspect of the season (family is the big catch word in the special). Also, the special is rather short with a total running time of about 23 minutes. Despite this, I did enjoy watching it and found it somewhat entertaining. I like SCARED SHREKLESS better, but SHREK THE HALLS is ok.

DRAGONS HOLIDAY  GIFT OF THE NIGHT FURY is set in the world of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON and takes place sometime after the events of that movie. Once a year, the Vikings of Berk gather together and celebrate their one and only holiday, Snoggletog. They decorate a giant tree in the square, put up special decorations, and have a massive feast. This year Snoogletog is supposed to be even better because the Vikings now have their dragon companions living with them. However, before the festivities start all the dragons leave Berk and disappear in a massive migration. Well, not quite all the dragons: Toothless remains behind. Everyone is upset in the village and Hiccup sets out to not only find out what happened to the dragons, but help Toothless who seems left out.

Overall, I enjoyed watching DRAGONS HOLIDAY  GIFT OF THE NIGHT FURY and felt it fits in well with the world of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. Some of the jokes surrounding Christmas traditions are kind of funny (such as yak nog instead of egg nog). However, other than elements of giving and family, there aren't many positive or holiday messages to be had here. Instead, you get Snoogletog and another adventure in Berk. Thats about it.

Finally, there is KUNG FU PANDA HOLIDAY. This is set during the holiday time after Po has become the Dragon Warrior. The short focuses on a tough choice Po has to make. As the Dragon Warrior, he is informed my Master Shifu that he is responsible for hosting the Winter Feast for all the Kung Fu Masters. However, he torn because the Winter Feast has always been a time that he and his father have spent together fixing chicken noodle soup for all the poor in the community. Hosting the Winter Feast is a huge honor, but spending the Winter Feast with his father is also very important. With the help from the Furious Five and a rabbit cook named Wo Hop, Po thinks he will be able to appease both his father and Master Shifu. However, Po realizes that even with all the help, he has to choose between the two.

In terms of the Kung Fu Panda series, KUNG FU HOLIDAY is an excellent special. It fits right in with the world established in the original KUNG FU PANDA movie. The movie also has all the voices from the movie back for this special (Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, David Cross, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, etc.). That doesnt always happen for short specials like this, so its really nice when it does.

With that said, in terms of Christmas specials, KUNG FU HOLIDAY doesnt really fit. The movie is marketed and sold at Christmas and is often packaged with other Christmas specials. However, this is NOT a Christmas movie. The holiday being celebrated is the Winter Feast, a holiday which seems most similar to the Dongzhi Festival that is a celebration of the winter solstice in many eastern countries of the world. This doesnt make the movie a bad movie, but I know of parents who were disappointed after watching this special because it wasn't a Christmas movie. Also, the short is only about 22 minutes, not including the credits.

There are several extra features on the discs including some games, specials, and lots of previews for other Dreamworks features and shorts. Overall, its a nice collection that kids in the family will specially enjoy.",1388361600,,6287,4.63375224416517

Well, here we have four reasonably delightful and entertaining short holiday-themed films from Dreamworks. They're based around the Dreamworks movie franchises of Shrek, Madagascar, How to Train Your Dragon and Kung-Fu Panda. Despite having only seen two of the four franchises, I found all four movies to be enjoyable. Let's look at them each.

Madagascar - I know basically nothing about this movie franchise. The story here concerns Santa's sleigh crashing and animals teaming-up to get the presents delivered for Christmas. There's some amusing North Pole/South Pole confrontations between the reindeer and the penguins and a few amusing moments. I'm sure children will get a kick out of the talking animals, if nothing else.

How to Train Your Dragon - A young boy (with, I notice, an artificial leg, which is nice to see in a kids movie), lives in a village full of dragons and Vikings, because why not. One day, the dragons all fly off, and the town is left wondering why. The boy spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out what happened. This was a bit more entertaining, and I did really enjoy the different dragon designs. I also liked the central message of ""if you love something, set it free"". Overall entertaining.

Kung-Fu Panda - I saw the first movie and thought it was decent. This video is pretty much more of the same, only this time concerning an epic feast that is being prepared. Jack Black is always fun, and the video was about as good as the movie. If you liked the film, you'll probably like this, too, and I'm sure little kids will enjoy it regardless.

Shrek - Ah, here we go. The gem of the set. I saw the first two movies and really liked them. This film is more of the same, showing Shrek and Fiona trying to have their first Christmas as a family. It then goes a bit wild when Donkey shows up and starts interfering, as he does. Then it ends with a pretty decent message about how flexible the word ""family"" can be. I really liked this story. It was funnier than the others, and it was really helped by having all the regular movie cast members reprising their roles. Definitely a worthy successor to the movies.

So there you go. Four decent movies, four stars, and an excellent package for anyone who likes these franchises.",1387238400,,2338,4.6352657004830915

Even though they are great, it's nice to add a few new ones to the mix. This is a fun set of four movies in a 2 CD set. Because we are already familiar with the core movies so seeing familiar characters is great. Even though they are not box-office movies, they have still be animated pretty darn close to the original quality.

5851818,5,B00DS79HCE,"What a treat! I hadn't seen any of these four shorts when they were originally on TV, so this was my first time seeing them with my 6-year-old and we both loved them. We watched two one night and two the next-- they're between 22 and 28 minutes long apiece, so about the same length as a typical TV episode. They're not your typical straight-to-DVD quality-- these are really cute, funny, and visually appealing specials that are a welcome addition to our old classic favorites. I love me some Frosty and Rudolph just like the next momma, but it was about time to shake things up a bit with some new holiday stories.

This is a great collection for your own family, grandkids, nieces and nephews, friends, etc. They have good-hearted messages about the importance of family and generosity, without beating you over the head with ""the moral of the story.""",1386547200,,854,4.655629139072848

But I was pleasantly surprised. I liked each of the different stories, especially SHREK THE HALLS and KUNG FU PANDA HOLIDAY.  Great fun for the whole family with clear, colorful picture quality and stories that each are little heartgrabbers in their own ways.

Children will like the bigger-than-life characters, the music, the color and the short attention-grabbing format.

My only complaint is that none of the movies came with English subtitles. French and Spanish, yes. I am partially deaf and would have appreciated the subtitles on the movies since there were a lot of accents and I found the words hard to understand at times.

NOTE: I received a copy of these movies in exchange for my honest review.",1386547200,,1175,5.808139534883721
5851820,5,B00DS79HCE,"My daughter is obsessed with Shrek so I was super excited to give her this Dreamworks Collection! Not just because I knew shed love it but because we could finally stop replaying the same Shrek movies over and over! Now we have a new one on constant replay  yay!
These four holiday movies take some of your favorites characters and made new movies starring them just in time for Christmas. My kids love Shrek and Madagascar so they just want to watch these two over and over. The beauty of a set that includes four different movies is that theres something for everyone. At just under $20, I don't care if my kids don't want to watch all of them because its such a great value!

I love watching all the Christmas movies this time of year so it was nice to add something new to the collection. They are all true originals and family friendly.

Dreamworks movies and cartoons tend to have a bit of adult humor which I personally appreciate when sitting down to watch a cartoon. However, there is nothing unseemly or inappropriate for little ears so you really get the best of both worlds. Mom and Dad get to be entertained too while watching a kids movie!

The DreamWorks Holiday Collection would make the perfect family gift for all the families on your list this year!",1386374400,,1268,4.5

5851822,4,B00DS79HCE,"This small set of short movies based on the Dreamworks films is very entertaining.  The animation is well done and they brought back all of the original voice actors, so it's a top flight production overall.

All of the stories are well thought out, and if you've seen the movies they are based on then you will have a sense of what the humor, pacing, and overall feel will be.  For example, if you don't let your children watch Shrek movies because of the sometimes crude humor, you won't like the Holiday Shrek either.  None of the movies is a standout production, but they are all well done and have simple and wholesome messages to impart.

Each movie has its own set of bonus features that were enjoyable as well.  There were even some cute games to play.

All in all... a nice set of holiday movies.",1385337600,,805,4.4353741496598635

I've got fond memories of ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" but the Dreamworks Holiday Collection brings fond memories to yet another generation.  The excitement, the laughter, and the amazing animation brings the collection to life.

This is a boxed set with two DVD discs, each in it's own case.  The first disc contains Shrek the Halls and Merry Madagascar.  The second had Dragons Holiday:  Gift of the Night Fury and Kung Fu Panda Holiday.

Dreamworks Holiday Collection:

DISC 1:

  Shrek the Halls:  Ogres don't celebrate Christmas do they?  Certainly not Shrek, but he has promised Princess Fiona a little present.  Shrek has no idea what Christmas is all about so has to buy a book to figure out what all the hooplah is about.  It's going to be a grand old holiday until Donkey shows up with the gang.  Oh, no ... Shrek got mad!  Is there anything that can salvage Shrek's very first Christmas celebration?  (ABC, November 28, 2007)

  Merry Madagascar:  Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria were heading to New York, or so they thought.  Their hot air balloon was shot out of the air by those danged lemurs who thought they were the ""red night goblin.""  Not to worry, that red night goblin was shot down right after they were.  It was the  24th of Julianuary and poor Santa wasn't going to be able to deliver his gifts.  Well, now, just who could make those deliveries?  You guessed it!  (November 17, 2009)

DISC 2:

Dragons Holiday:  Gift of the Night Fury:  Toothless, a dragon of Berk, cannot fly by himself and the only way he could was with Hiccup's help.  Hiccup helps him out and he's soon able to fly, but when they are coming back from a flight a sudden whoosh of dragons leaving Berk knock off Hiccups helmet. It had promised to be a great Snoggletog festival, but where had all the dragons gone and why?  Better get a cup of yak nog when you're watching this one!  (November 15, 2011)

  Kung Fu Panda Holiday:  The annual Winter Feast at the Jade palace is coming up and Master Po in going to be in charge.  Master Shifu gave Po the assignment, but no, Po would rather spend the holiday with his father, Mr. Ping.  No way can Mr. Ping attend because the banquet is only for the masters of kung fu.  Big kung fu dilemma and it only gets worse when rabbit Wo Hop annoys him in the kitchen. What is Master Po going to do?  (NBC, November 24, 2010)

5851824,4,B00DS79HCE,"This collection is, on the whole, very good. I'm going to break the review down into several different sections, though, because there are a lot of different considerations.

1) Packaging
This may be a 'holiday collection', but it's not collectible or anything like that. The package is plain cardboard, not a tin or anything fancy. It's a two-disc set but the packaged it in two individual DVD cases instead of reducing packaging mass and putting them both in a double DVD case, probably to make it a 'box set'.

2) Menus and Previews
On each disc the menu is on a single screen, arranged as such:
Movie 1 -- Movie 1 setup -- Movie 2 -- Movie 2 setup
I found this to be both ugly and clunky, but is a relatively minor issue that will only trouble people who hate bad design.
Each disc also has, for reasons unclear, promos for the videos on the other disc.

3) Video Quality
As with most modern CG movies, if anything, the quality might be too good. The fur on the Panda's face, Fiona's hair, the vikings' beards, they're all so finely detailed that at times it can be distracting. Unless you have a $20,000 TV, it's going to be your equipment that limits the visual quality here, not the DVDs.

4) The Videos Themselves
4a) Dragons Holiday/How To Train Your Dragon
By far the best of the bunch, a nice story about how real gifts are the ones that mean something, given to you by the people you love - plus explosions and such, to keep it exciting.
4b) Shrek the Halls/Shrek 3.5
Another solid entry, showing why it's the spirit of Christmas that matters, and family, not getting the decorations perfect or meeting other people's expectations of how to celebrate - plus some Shrek slapstick for the kids and stealth puns for the adults.
4c) Merry Madagascar/Madagascar
The main story in this one is about stepping up to make right what you set wrong, but the secondary story about greed and mistreating your inferiors irritated me. Julian is shown, briefly, to be unhappy because of his actions, but that's only 15 or so seconds compared to several minutes of poor behavior.
4d) Kung Fu Panda Holiday/Kung Fu Panda
I did not like this one at all. Best i can tell, the moral is that if you have conflicting responsibilities, you should basically skip out on both of them, but somehow it'll all turn out ok anyway. In fact, people will thank you for ruining everything and contributing nothing. Added to this is a short scene at the beginning where the Panda apparently snaps a bandit's neck while engaging in casual conversation with the other animals, and despite the fact that the bandit was already subdued. This short alone drops my rating of the whole product from five stars to four.
