777691,5,6304026498,This usually unknown film delivers far more than you'd expect.,1437523200,,62,5.3
777692,3,6304026498,"Ok, the acting isn't very good but I think there's Merit in the story it's cute and heart warming I think these guy really love each other. I know Collin gets a little bored and wants to go have his big adventure, but he come back in a few hours and when he does you can tell he doesn't want to hurt Hugh who is still sleeping in there bed. the story is a little slow but I say watch it, it's fun in a campy sort of a way.",1369785600,,422,3.7
777693,5,6304026498,"I don't understand the bad reviews that this film is getting.  It doesn't have much of a plot, that much is true.  But I must disagree with others that the acting is bad or wooden.  It's a slice-of-life type of movie that really does concentrate on the characters.  And the scenes don't try to do more than that.  I thought the bar scene was really great, and some others but I don't want to spoil the movie.  It reminds me of something that could have been created in the 1960s instead of the 1990s.  And I don't think it would have been nearly as well done had it been done in color.  As a matter of fact, if you watched the outtakes on the DVD you can see it was shot in color, so I'm sure the black and white was done on purpose.  I give this five stars.",1366329600,5,758,4.033557046979865
777694,1,6304026498,"Black and white film with action as vivid as a dead cow. Wth people care and create such tedious things?
If you want to watch it, you need either huge amount of coffee or an alarm clock, which wakes you up now and then.
Once again a movie overloaded with quasi intelligent dialogues, very slow takes and amatourish actors. However, it doesn't hurt to watch actors playing two leading parts. At least they did their best.",1308787200,,420,4.5394736842105265
777695,1,6304026498,"The movie was done completely in black and white, which normally wouldn't matter to me.  The only difference is that this movie seemed more like a look in the lives of disfunctional people through a convenient store security camera.  About the most interesting part of the whole movie was seeing the main character's best friend come in to a thrift shop to find poka dot shoes to match her poka dot dress, if you call that interesting.",1117324800,8,435,4.636363636363637
777696,4,6304026498,The complete movie happens in a single day and I thought overall they did an excellent job to capture the emotions and feelings. It's an excellent story and I felt so real about it. Very well photographed and directed. I  loved it.,964569600,,231,4.5
777751,5,6304026498,Such a wonderful film.  I was taken aback at first but was fixated with this film and the characters....almost a European feel but truly American...,1463875200,,148,4.92

7861177,5,6304026498,"The movie had it's problems, as do most independents, but I found it strangely affecting.
It's laid back, kind of like a long, summer day. It's about a relationship on the brink of
change. Had a very distinctive, almost European feel to it. More about substance than
plot. A movie you relax into.",1486425600,,296,4.60377358490566
