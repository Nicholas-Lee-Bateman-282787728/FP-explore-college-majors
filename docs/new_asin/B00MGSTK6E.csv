8672146,1,B00MGSTK6E,"The presenter takes a point of view first and then gathers information to support it.

You are told by the presenter what is good and what is bad from the point of view of a postmodernist.  Late 19 century & early 20 century works are basically bad - why? Panned over at speed while the presenter prattles on, the paintings behind him glow with color... has he really even looked at them?
It is like watching a student present a class project regurgitating what the teacher wants to hear, not yet looking for himself.

Some interesting work shown - but the conclusions drawn by the presenter seem unjustified and not thought out or truly observed. And at its most basic level, it does not tell you how to look at a painting for yourself.

8672147,1,B00MGSTK6E,"By the title: ""How to Look at a Painting,"" I was expecting a presentation of a painting and an ""autopsy"" of it. IE...What is the subject? What is the medium? What is your reaction? But, this is simply Justin Paton doing random stuff with random artists.",1448150400,3,253,4.521739130434782
8672148,3,B00MGSTK6E,"Art curator Justin Paton is the host of this 12-episode New Zealand based series that takes viewers to museums and artists studios to provide a fresh perspective on understanding art. Each episode explores a specific theme (landscapes, faces, etc.). A brief overview and history of the subject is discussed and then artists are profiled and interviewed about their motivations and how they get their artworks accomplished. A 60-minute documentary titled What is Beauty? discusses ten factors that make a work of art beautiful.

The series is infused with techno-beat music and frenetic editing, probably an effort to appeal to younger students. This aspect isn't as annoying as the constant shots of the host walking around. It seems like 90% of the show has Paton walking down a street, walking into a museum, walking across a field, etc. etc. It became so amusing that every time a scene was finished, I would be thinking ""Cue to host walking"". With all the minutes devoted to footage of Paton walking about, a lot of art work could have been shown instead.",1425945600,13,1059,4.949438202247191
8672149,2,B00MGSTK6E,"Based primarily in New Zealand.  The art ""guide"" didn't provide much guidance at all.  I guess I was looking for more insight than what would be available with cursory museum self-guided tour.",1420934400,8,192,4.96875

8672151,5,B00MGSTK6E,"I loved it. So easy to enjoy and learn at the same time. Stimulating; like sable to canvas. Not just for artists, but any art fan. The presenter is from New Zealand and is knowledgeable but also has his priorities straight, and his feet on the ground. He makes painted art as fun as it is enriching. Each of 12 episodes run 23 minutes and they are so well done they would make SUPER educational classroom viewing. Each is a great discussion starter. Vitality pours from the screen. Could be called Painting Appreciation 101. I wish this presenter (Justin Paton) had been one of my university profs when I earned my art degree in the late 60s.
A feast ""for the eyes, mind, and heart.""
