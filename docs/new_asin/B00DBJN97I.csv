8591297,5,B00DBJN97I,"This story makes the statement that we leave no man behind rather an empty phrase. But then this island is just one of the numerous island battlegrounds of WWII,sadly nearly all forgotten. I cannot understand how our government could have responded that all of the fallen were repatriated,when I am sure they well knew that this was not the case. All of those families that gave their most precious possesions deserved so much better than to be just pushed aside like that,with no proof of the validity of that response. Those men were subjected to a hell that few can even begin to imagine,yet their sacrifices have been largely ignored,because for some reason the war in Europe was regarded as more  important. How can ones life being snuffed out on the battlefield in France or Germany be more of a loss than one being lost on some God forsaken island that no one ever even heard of. In fact,mention Normandy or Berlin today and you will get immediate responses,but mention Tarawa,Saipan,Guam,etc. and people look at you as if you are speaking a foreign language. As far as the horrific struggle in the Pacific,who remembers the names?Only those dwindling few that suffered there,and when they are all gone so to will the memories of those places. Sad but true.
This incident on Tarawa is a story that I am sure can be retold time and again on so many of the other islands fought over during the ""march to Tokyo"".And all those stories need to be told,if for no other reason than to honor those that fought there and gave the last full measure of devotion while dealing with an unbelievably fanatical enemy under some of the worst climatic conditions.
God bless all of those involved,living and dead. They deserve our highest honors and gratitude.",1402185600,4,1749,4.753289473684211
