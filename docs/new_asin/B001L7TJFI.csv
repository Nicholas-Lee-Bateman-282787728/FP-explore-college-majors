8317488,5,B001L7TJFI,"This was my first WAR DVD purchase. As an aviation enthusiast and flight simmer, the presentation was really wonderful. I appreciated the aircraft walk-around prior to cockpit preparation. The cockpit procedures and checklist were easy to understand (despite their accents). Another great feature was the inflight meal preparation which was meticulously done by an inflight chef. When the crew encountered a fuel imbalance during cruise, I paused the video and thought of the possible solution. I'm glad that it was right! This DVD is a truly recommended material. A great way to start my WAR collection.",1350172800,,604,5.302083333333333
