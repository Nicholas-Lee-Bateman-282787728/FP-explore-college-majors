8070259,3,B0009Y8RNY,"This early TV double feature showcases two run-of-the-mill episodes from basically forgotten programs. Four Star Playhouse and The Star and the Story were anthology shows that boasted celebrities in short stories.

The Gun stars Dick Powell in a role that is basically standard for him at this point. He plays a cop with a loving wife and three boys who comes home after a hard day at work. Everyone in the neighborhood takes it upon themselves to stop by, the milkman, the grocer, the mailman, their neighbor, etc. When the cop's gun turns up missing, he goes into a panic looking for it, hoping he'll find it before it is too late.

The print on this film is okay, but it is being filmed from an outside camera. The sound isn't great, and the cameraman moves the camera a few times in the beginning, making the picture shake, which is quite annoying.

The second episode is from The Star and The Story and is titled The Brief Affair, starring Joanne Dru. A contented wife discovers that her husband is having an affair with a woman he works with. She tells him she will only grant him a divorce if he has no contact with the other woman for three months. In that three months he falls back in love with his wife, but she falls in love with his best friend.",1294358400,2,1258,4.437229437229437
