2770887,5,B000NJWIQW,"This is an excellent supplement to the books I am reading on the history of NASCAR.  I was a teenager in the mid to late 60's, and didn't watch much of this.  Now it is fascinating to see stock car racing from the period covered by the films, particularly as they were a lot more ""stock"" then compared to now, and the men operating the machines drove more ""by the seat of their pants""!",1419206400,,385,4.1891891891891895

2770905,3,B000NJWIQW,"Good racing footage from the early days of NASCAR and several of the more exciting races.  Stock cars never were really ""stock"", but the ones you see in these races are as close as you will probably ever see to ones you could have actually driven off the show room floor.  The Chevy vs the World comparisons are laughable, but hey that's how they advertised back then.",1395532800,2,368,4.477611940298507
2770906,5,B000NJWIQW,"It is fairly accurate.  It shows Banjo Matthews (later the car builder) quite well.  It didn't say much about the creative work that went on, but the film was actual film of the races and the announcer was neutral.",1389484800,,214,4.461538461538462
