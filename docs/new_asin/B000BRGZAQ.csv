This series tells as well as shows.  These television documentaries are more than museum tours on film.  They constantly interweave the artists' works with their lives.  They show us human beings, their careers, their personal relationships, their sources of inspiration, and in many cases their struggle to overcome the skepticism of critics and society.  Produced in England, Europe and the United States by such distinguished producers as the BBC, these programs form the nucleus of a home-video library for anyone interested in art.

THE REAL WORLD OF ANDREW WYETH

Filmed in Maine and Pennsylvania where Wyeth has spent his working life, this documentary is a relaxed and friendly interview, intercut with sensitive footage of Wyeth's work and of the landscapes and environmental images which are its inspiration.  Wyeth is very much a traditionalist looking for 'truth' in his compositions and portraits which are broadly realistic but, at the same time, disturbingly provoactive.",1186876800,8,1009,5.423076923076923
