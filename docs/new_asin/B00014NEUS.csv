1970445,4,B00014NEUS,"""Meeting a stranger in a public place + mistaken identity = hillarity."" It's a premise that has been used in romantic comedy films for 40 years, but it is given a creatively modern and deliciously diverse twist in ""Km. 0"" (Kilometer Zero), a 2000 romantic comedy set in Madrid.  Fourteen diverse people, including an engaged couple, a nervous man looking for his first sexual experience, a hooker, a would-be director and a would-be actress, a rich matron looking for a fling without her neglectful husband, a musical producer, all plan to meet someone at the landmark spot in that city at the same time, and everyone ends up spending time with someone other than who they planned to meet.

It's a fast-paced, creative and warmly captivating farce, showing how people's lives can unexpectedly intersect and affect each other for good. The characters, and the actors that play them, are genuine and likeable, and the direction and photography are excellent.  If there is to be one central moral of the story, it must be ""Life goes on...and so do you"", with subplots involving reluctant grooms, a mother-and-son ""reunion"" that doesn't go as she planned, one that could be titled ""Queer Guardian Angel for the Straight Guy,"" and kind of a reverse ""Pretty Woman"" story.  Not a gay film, but the gay characterizations are positive and endearing.  In Spanish with English subtitles.",1100563200,7,1376,4.965217391304348
1970446,5,B00014NEUS,"I should have written sooner.  Sorry.  This movie is frothy, like frothing at the mouth, but it is not not fluffy.  Until the last minute of the film, it is merely glorious.  The stunning ending passeth glory, and brought grateful tears to the eyes of my friends and me. We are all over 30, and so maybe know enough about life, and its lost chances, to take this loving document to heart.

The device of meeting at the ""origin"" of the graph of life sets up a promising metaphor. Various individuals unknown to each other have arranged to meet another at Km. 0 at 6PM.  Everyone goes off with the wrong person.  Almost every major kind of couple except lesbian is represented, including mother and son.  The mismatches cause enormous audience anxiety, and so the surprising resolutiuons are satisfying in the extreme.

Even in this age of ignorance, some will have heard of Freud and the Oedipus Complex.  Oedipal horror is aroused at the intimation that a mother has had sex with her son.  But this is a red psychological herring.  What matters is that the entire film takes place with the father absent.  He is too busy at a business conference to care what his wife is doing, as she pursues sex in Madrid with men the age of her lost son.  The film in effect kills off the father, leaving Romance to unfold with infinite meaning and in in perfect order.  The ""mystical"" conclusion transcends psychology as it wraps up the meaningful coincidences into a neat package. The mysticism is completely pagan, (as was the end to the first Matrix film), claiming that Romance is the True God.

If Life Without Father could be as wonderful and loving as it is portrayed here, we could all live and love happily ever after.",1095811200,10,1714,4.588815789473684
1970447,3,B00014NEUS,"Km. 0 started off started off very well. Fourteen people all agree to meet at Km. 0, the center of Madrid, for various reasons. Unfortunately, a series of mix-ups ensue and their lives intersect in one way or another. It seemed like a promising and original romantic comedy, and for the most part, it was. Unfortunately, in the end, it took a downhill detour and headed for the worst. My friends and I were thouroughly enjoying this movie, a fun, light, and fluffy comedy that was funny and charming. However, with only 20 minutes left, it seemed the writer was just trying to finish off the film without any thought or originality put into it like the rest of the picture. The very rushed, very cheesy, and horribly coincidental ending destroyed what I would have otherwise considered one of the best films of the year. Being a screenwriter myself, I understood what was trying to be done, I just didn't feel it worked for this particular picture and there were plenty of missed opportunitites for the ending. Nonetheless, the film was still very enjoyable, but the ending disappointed us all, and made us laugh because of how bad it was. It's worth a rent though for lovers of foreign or independent cinema.",1090108800,7,1209,4.7075471698113205
1970448,5,B00014NEUS,"Kilometer Zero (Km. 0) is a wonderful Spanish import about how missed connections and fate can alter your life path. Fourteen people are drawn to the title spot at the center of Madrid for various assignations on one of the hottest day of the year.  A young film director arrives in town, looking to share an apartment with an actress friend of his sister.  The actress, intent on kickstarting her career, spots a famous producer and hatches a plan to get his attention.  A down-on-her-luck hooker arranges to meet an inexperienced groom-to-be to conduct some business.  A dancer uses the internet to connect with a sex partner.  A middle-aged businessman's neglected wife fills her hours of boredom by hiring a gigolo.  The gigolo's roommate, a gay man, longs for a lover rather than just another sexual partner.  In the heat, patience evaporates and fate intervenes, leading to numerous missed connections and mistaken identities.  Several locals become drawn into the mix as well, including a local bartender who dreams of owning his own business; the bartender's shallow, robbery-prone fiance and her younger sister; a police officer with impulse control issues; and a mysterious stranger who seems rather bemused by the whole scenario.
The film is extremely European in tone, and very unlike similar-themed American and British comedies.  Sexuality is celebrated in all forms, including physical relations between older women and younger men, friendly intimacy and flirting between straight men and gay men, and the goal of helping a prostitute to earn what she's worth, rather than rescuing her from the profession.  Sex scenes are fun and erotic without becoming overly graphic, human frailties are addressed without judgment, and taboo topics of concern are touched upon as plot points before being clarified as misunderstandings.  The cast is uniformly attractive and up to the challenge, the script does an excellent job of interweaving the various characters and storylines, and the direction and production values are first rate.  If you enjoy films that are politically incorrect, brazen, and very, very sexy, you'll have a great time meeting up with the crowd at Kilometer Zero.",1088812800,42,2192,5.231428571428571
1970449,5,B00014NEUS,"This movie is a gem of a movie.  I have not loved a ""new"" film as much as this in a very long time!  You will fall in love with all of characters (which includes, a sexy heterosexual male prostitute, an ageing female prostitute that doesn't charge enough, a lonely well-off middle aged woman that needs affection, a put upon and often robbed bride to be, a  ""want to be"" starlit that is willing to risk being ""run  over"" by a moving car in order to get a role and MOST OF ALL  a wonderfully erotic and very wise gay angel)  and this is mainly due to the skill of the actors that portray them.  See this film with someone you love.  You won't regret it!!!!!!  Why can't Hollywood make a film like this?

Yes, indeed a lot in this movie depends on coincidence; however, it would be wonderful if things in  life happened as they do in this movie on a very hot afternoon in Madrid.",1078963200,4,877,4.191616766467066
1970450,5,B00014NEUS,"It seems we are in a time for the release of many fine Spanish films and the release of the DVD KILOMETER.0 is one of the best. Directed by Yolanda Garcia Serrano and Juan Luis Ibarra (yes, two directors and perhaps that is why the story is so equally cognizant of the female/male interpretation of relationships), this beautifully paced, hilarious, touching, tender comedy has it all.  'Km. 0' is the very center of Madrid and serves as a coincidental meeting point for each of the 14 characters in the story. Mistaken identities, curious consequences, chance fortunes and misfortunes, surprise discoveries all collide and the result is a fun and entertaining farce that keeps your attention through the film.  Each of the characters (a prostitute, a novice film director, gay men out for internet encounters, hustlers, middle aged needy women, sisters at opposite ends of the values spectrum, a sexually uptight fiancee, a needy bartender, a frustrated actress/singer, a guardian angel, etc) is well fleshed out and everyone of these disparate characters finds the entry to our heart at the end of a day.  The cast is uniformly excellent: each one finds the center of the character so that we know the characters as well as we know our best friends.  The musical score is a delight, the views of Madrid and the funky interiors of the various rendezvous all are imaginatively colorful, and the sensitivity of the two directors is secure and mature.  This is a little marvel of a film is well worth buying for your permanent collection.  In Spanish with English subtitles.",1078272000,14,1572,4.9356060606060606
1970451,4,B00014NEUS,"This is a charming film filled with attractive actors and good acting; clever and funny, but poignant story lines. This film one-ups ""Love Actually"" in that it includes a story line involving a gay couple. Watch it ""with someone you love"" (if possible)",1077667200,2,252,4.883720930232558
1970452,5,B00014NEUS,"Thank Goodness for European Cinema!!  Leave the fantastical budgets, and astounding special effects to the likes of hollywood!  This is a movie about humanity, human emotion, and the interaction and development of wonderful characters.  The plot is wonderful, there are 12 characters, and all of them are important but it is not, in the least, convoluted.  The characters are all well fleshed out and developed, and one can not help but feel empathy, sympathy for each and every one of them.  The story involves the characters having independently made arrangements to meet (they do not all know one another, they are meeting in pairs) but they are all meeting at the same spot, the famous Kilometer 0, at the Puerta Del Sol!  Confusion for characters ensues, allowing the viewer to see the wonderful mulitdimensionality of them.  It is a fast paced and consuming movie.  It is in spanish, but has english and french subtitles, ad the wonderful acting does, in many ways, transcend the language barrier.  I watched it with a friend who speaks no spanish and he liked it as much as I.  There is a love story for everyone in this film, gay or straight.  There are relationships other than love and lust as well, and the ecclectic mix of characters makes for a wonderful and transforming film.  I encourage all film fans, and fans of humanity and the human condition to buy (or at the very least rent) this film.  It is worth while, and can easily be watched more than once.",1077148800,8,1471,4.7215686274509805
1970463,5,B00014NEUS,"A very fine example of european cinema. I have seen this one in a cinema and I am still waiting for european release with subtitles.
It's a very heart-warming story, with positive message. Funny at some moments, serious at others. The plot consists of a few stories, which somehow are connected one to another. But any of them would exist without the famous ""KM. 0"" meeting point:)
What can I add more? The acting is superb. You will not feel disappointed after watching the movie.",1304985600,,481,4.670588235294118
1970464,5,B00014NEUS,"There are different pairs in this movie, a student with a flamenco dancer, a middle age lady with a gigolo, an actress with a director, a young man with a whore, a business man with a man cruising for gay dates, a young girl with a policeman and a bartender with the sister of his fiance. All of them in a way or the other will meet at Km. 0, a central place of Madrid, and more or less all of them will meet with the wrong partner that in the end will prove to be the perfect one.

The only real ""gay"" couple is Benjamin and Bruno, meeting by chance while Bruno was supposed to be the one night stand of someone else. Benjamin claims to be interested only in sex, but when Bruno is ready to go, after their trist, Benjamin comes out like the romantic man he is, only that Bruno has committment issues he will need to overcome.

I quite liked also the pair about the middle age woman with the gigolo. Both of them are more deep than expected. But truth be told all the couples are nice on their own, with an interesting story that you can easily follow and understand, something difficult to manage having only 1 hour and half, 7 couples and 14 characters.

Nice movie, not strictly gay; in a way a proof that in Spain being gay is ""ordinary"", there is not prejudice, or at least not in this movie.",1300579200,3,1298,4.184

Please let there be more, equally as good & hopefully better! Although I'm not sure how that is done. This is a great movie for EVERYONE.  The story is well written, comedic, with twists of 'agnst' that offset the fable/story line.  The actors are even better drawing us in to their lives & touching our hearts. These talented Spaniards come along at the right time, creating a world that crosses cultures, languages & stereotypes, for all to partake in/of.  Give us more!",1182816000,2,629,4.6909090909090905
1970470,5,B00014NEUS,"A hilarious comedy involving the lives of fourteen people and a gay guardian angel. People meeting other people for various reasons but not all of them meet the stranger they were expecting, as wires get a little  crossed! Spanish.....with english subtitles. Seems everyone is basically searching for the same things, but some in all the wrong places. Will they find what they are looking for in spite of mistaken identities? Well, that might just be the job of a very unconventional angel of unknown origin. I highly recommend this one to anyone wanting a good lighthearted movie to lift their spirits. Top quality picture and sound. Great acting and casting. You simply can't go wrong with this one. I doubt you've ever seen another movie anything like Kilometer Zero. One of the best I've seen in a long long time! VIVA AMOR!",1161302400,4,828,4.830985915492958
1970471,5,B00014NEUS,"Kilometer zero is a central meeting point in Spain which is the perfect location to begin a film. Several people from different walks of life have made appointments to meet there ... some clandestinely ... some are looking for love in all the wrong places ... some without embarrassment ... some by chance. *All* share the need to connnect with another person on some level of love ... each story has a twist and unexpected turn which results in very funny outcomes. The film shows the open attitude toward love and its multiple expressions as understood from a European perspective. It is thoroughly funny, engaging and entertaining.

Amor and her boyfriend depart as she prepares for her wedding day to shop for a dress. It turns out her sister, named Roma, really loves Amor's boyfriend and wants to win him for herself. Amor reports her wallet with credit cards as stolen to a policeman with whom she exhanges personal stories after which she discovers they knew each other from a long time ago. This chance meeting causes their lives to reconnect in unexpected ways, as her wedding plans to the first boyfriend come to a screeching halt. An older woman is looking for a liason with a gigolo because her love life is so unsatisfying with her husband. During their trsyt, she discovers a photo in a wallet on a table, the photo is identical to one she carries in her wallet. She is appalled at the multiple possiblities this photo raises ... The conclusion to her dilemma is worth viewing.

A young college student meets a street walker but mistakes her for someone else, he goes to her room and he is jolted into reality when she behaves in her usual manner and demands he pay. He explains his cash flow problems ... He cleans her apartment to make amends and begins to affect her life, her looks and improve her self-esteem, giving her something she never expected, self-respect. A beautiful actress is going for an audition, while crossing the street, she is hit by a car ... the driver and she discuss what to do in a restaurant. This unfortuante accident created a huge opening for her to have an audition. The two collide in more ways than they expect ... A gay dancer makes an internet connection, with an appointment to meet at ""kilometer zero"". He meets a young man with whom he makes eye contact which definitely gives off sparks ... after a very heated physical rendevous together ... he discovers there was a mistake - it is interesting to see how they resolove their ""mistake"". A businessman responds to an ad for a physical encounter although he is engaged. He goes to Km. 0 but has second thoughts, wanders around, meets a young man with whom he goes to a restaurant as he discusses his delimma about being engaged and getting married ... The businessman learns more about his physical desires then he cares to know ... an unexpected twist which makes the comedy of this film really hilarious.
