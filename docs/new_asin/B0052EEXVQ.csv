4529855,5,B0052EEXVQ,"New G.Gently episodes hot off the 2010 shelf. Gently has proven to be a winner with British Murder Mystery fans. This new set is no exception.

George Gently episodes are based on novels by Alan Hunter. This first series showed Commander Gently's wife killed right before his eyes. Through his grief, the cop takes the high road in finding criminals and bringing them to justice. Very much like ""Midsomer Murders"" [recommended] without the multiple murdered victims, but with the multi-plots in police, private, and associates lives. Bacchus has a money problem in one of episode from this series. Good writing makes the show. Will the large volume of Hunter novels available for adaptation cause this show to continue? Hopefully!

Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is through, calm, and plays the mentor/father to his youthful assistant, Detective Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). Their relationship is as important to the story/series as the crimes and investigations. Both are performance perfect. Bacchus provides some laughs. Gently's grief, sometimes brings tears. An emotional crime series, mystery, suspenseful, fast moving, and packed with plot. Setting is 1966.

Feature length episodes, each carry SUBTITLES.
""Gently Evil""--Gently and Bacchus investigate a brutal murder in a coastal Northumberland village. A BEAUTIFUL location to get bludgeoned. There are signs of a sympathetic nature to this killer of this girl. A birth certificate indicates Satan being her daughter's dad. There is much to uncover yet to get to the bottom of this crime. A dark nature here.

""Peace & Love""--Peace protesting and mob action against the police is due to the arrival of a nuclear sub. A demonstrator's leader is dead. Plenty of university turmoil surrounds the case when the investigation leads to a local campus for Gently and Bacchus. Jarrow is the location and football (soccer) was supposed to be the game.

Not recommended for the kiddies, bloody good murder, and emphasis on the bloody.",1327622400,,1990,5.284810126582278

4529858,5,B0052EEXVQ,"Another great journey with the great George Gently and his associate Lee Ingleby.  The episodes are A-1, the mysteries keep you guessing and the way Gently handles life problems sometimes stagger the imagination.  He shows what a wonderful man he truly is above the rough interior of the Inspector who solves crimes.  He makes his associate John, played by Lee Ingleby, a better person, and good father.  I enjoyed all the episodes and look forward to watching them again.  Great actors, great stories, holds your attention and makes you want more.",1477958400,,548,4.978021978021978
4529859,5,B0052EEXVQ,"George is a soft-spoken tough guy, who means business, while still being human and trying to maintain absolute adherence to the law, while maintaining ethics and high morals. This obviously leads to some truly interesting and emotional dilemmas. Watching him weave through these while educating his green but good-hearted side-kick makes for some of the most enjoyable tele I have ever watched. Also the character's development over time is fantastic as well. PLEASE WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE.......MAKE MORE EPISODES!!!!!!!!!!!!",1477785600,,524,5.6455696202531644
