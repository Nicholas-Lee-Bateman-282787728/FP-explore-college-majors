I bought it for the simple reason that I am a fan of Sylvie Testud and admire her wonderful talent as an actress. I was most definitely not disappointed with this film in any way. From the moment it started I was riveted to the screen and by the end felt I had been through a gamut of emotions myself.

Now, the one thing I will say about this film is I had to watch it again to really appreciate the performances by every single actor in this film. The plot is complex, riveting, and emotionally wrenching. For me it brought up many questions about the nature of consciousness, just what exactly are multiple personalities and how many of us switch around during an average day to many aspects of our personalities depending upon the situations we are in: work, home, shopping, driving, etc. When does one cross the line from switching ""hats"" or ""roles"" to becoming a patient with multiple personality disorder? There are definite diagnostic procedures, but what I am speaking about is what the film gets us, or at least got me to think about...  that journey within that can be terrifying.

I am ashamed to admit I had not been familiar with the work of Rene Manzor and am now going to rent and possibly buy what I can of his. He has won me over as a fan with this brilliant piece of work.

I cannot say enough about the performance of Sylvie Testud, watching her go from one personality to another. The change in her face, her body language, her voice, all of it amazing and a thrill to watch. And, as I stated previously, after the second viewing I was gobsmacked by the performances of Lambert Wilson, Frdric Diefenthal and Michel Duchaussoy.

If you are one who likes to delve into the depths of the mind; if you are one who likes to delve into the depths of the soul and hell and back, then this is one film you don't want to miss.

Thank you to all who made this production possible!",1188777600,,1974,4.362397820163488
