It looks like The School of Bad Acting + BadWigs&Beards4Gentiles dot com. If you are going to make a religious based movie please do it right or don't do it at all. If you want people to see your religion as a joke keep making movies like this. The trailer for this movie is soooo bad that I would rather club myself in the head with a rock than waste one second on such tripe....and I am a person who enjoys religious based movies.",1527292800,,565,4.339622641509434

8679649,1,B00NPBIFYY,"Oh dear. It feels wrong to write a review for something like this. Here's the honest truth without being cruel. This was clearly made by amateur film makers who wanted to perform a Bible story with their friends and family. They had no money, no professional performers, and no true concept of how to make a movie. For the record there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with that. HOWEVER, unless you watch the trailer (which I didn't) just going by the poster one would assume that this is a professionally made movie. That's why I feel compelled to give this one star. It's essentially false advertising, which is never a great thing to do. If there had been some sort of message or clip beforehand telling the audience that this was something that a group of people did for fun I would completely get it, but that was not the case, so the review has to reflect the reality.",1506124800,8,870,4.512658227848101
8679650,5,B00NPBIFYY,"This film portrays the story of Samson, from the book of Kings, in a way that is faithful to the text and encouraging to the faithful.  There is a reason, that despite his personal failings, Samson was included in the Hebrews Hall of Faith.  Watch this movie to find out.

A response to negative reviews:  Yes, this film is not a big-budget production.  If special effects is what you want the most then look elsewhere.  But if the story matters, then this is a fine option.",1500422400,4,474,4.453488372093023

The acting, the casting, the special effects, the ...... oh well - anything that has anything to do with a film - ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!!!",1487203200,3,283,4.461538461538462
8679653,1,B00NPBIFYY,The cover makes this look like a feature film. In reality it is an extremely low budget production -- similar to a church's nativity program. Don't waste your time or money!,1420675200,5,173,4.612903225806452
