5040080,5,B006ZAPSBK,"Thanks to the first reviewer of this film, I took a chance on it and must say - he was spot on with his review.  It's a killer movie.  Definitely paranormal spirits being delivered and a twisted serial killer with a unique sick reality.  I didn't know, could't guess how it all ends up. Didn't miss a second

This was an extremely entertaining film & low budget or not, certainly has the feel of a big money movie.  Do yourself a favor & watch this movie.",1381449600,5,455,4.244186046511628
5040081,5,B006ZAPSBK,"And it's a wrap for 2012's CASSADAGA. Another After Dark Films release. Basic premise has Lily retreating to a new life at Cassadaga after her sister is killed in a tragic accident. Traumatised by her loss, Lily seeks the help of a medium to connect with her sister. Instead, she connects with a darker spirit which possesses her and leads her down a self-destructive and sinister path.

A bizarre hybrid of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and RITES OF SPRING, CASSADAGA is not only an odd movie, but a slow movie too - and all the better for it. Beautifully shot with wonderful performances across the board, the characters and their interactions are the main drivers of this story. You can almost taste Lily's angst and guilt as she struggles to come to terms with her sister's tragic death, and her perceived part in such. And while some ends are left untied, the movie reaches a satisfying and heartbreaking conclusion.

One of my favourite horror films of the year and a huge step forward for After Dark.",1353283200,15,1022,4.768361581920904

5040091,2,B006ZAPSBK,"Just a cheap horror flick that was made to sell rentals, not hold out as being something special anyone would really wanna ever see again. It's a story about a deaf girl who loses her younger sister, she tries to reach out to her via a seance, but something else comes through and attaches itself to her. Now she has to play 6th sense with the ghost to solve who killed her. A pretty obvious killer, the twist surprise failed to make it a smart movie and missed the mark on trying to hide who done it really. The killer also enjoys chopping his victims up and making them look like a doll he can control. Just weird, noting special, nothing for gore fans, and not much of a mystery or suspense film either.

Rent it or download it if you feel you must see it, but I highly doubt you will kick yourself for never seeing this flick.",1397001600,,830,4.220125786163522

5040095,2,B006ZAPSBK,This had the potential to be a pretty good movie. But the acting and directing left much to be desired. I think in the hands of some seasoned veterans this would have been much better. I would recommend watching but only if you can see it for free.,1393286400,,248,4.1875
5040096,5,B006ZAPSBK,"Well, color me surprised! After Dark can be hit or miss. This is a grand slam. We've got a very rootworthy protagonist. She's smart, resourceful, resilient, and strong. She carries most of the film, as the other characters don't really get much screentime. Mike was a good foil for her, though I don't appreciate what he did. The psychic scenes were very effective. Love the blind guy. ""Gepetto"" was a real sicky. I'm so glad they didn't use a big guy in overalls. I am so over that. Not scary, guys! They need some charisma or some menace aside and  size alone doesn't cut it. This guy had the serial killer ""it"" factor working for him and a very creative way of executing his ""craft"". Thanks for that. The horror visuals actually worked and the flashbacks kept the pace moving. The movie moved along very well. There were several scenes with suspense and tension. The remainder was intriguing, as to what, who, and why? There were also no plot holes, though the killer was largely unexplored, like what made him tick. No backstory there. Well produced, well acted, tight story, and good plot with some unique elements. What more can I ask for?",1391817600,2,1145,4.640394088669951
5040097,1,B006ZAPSBK,"That is the question you'll be asking yourself. The film made no sense and was horribly executed. If you want a few scares, then go ahead and watch, but this film sucks.",1391299200,,169,4.3125
5040098,3,B006ZAPSBK,"Lily Morel is a blind art student who is devastated by the recent death of her younger sister.  She accepts a scholarship at a small, private college in the spiritualist community of Cassadaga.  The school is run by an elderly woman named Claire (Louise Fletcher) and Lily is allowed to move into an old house on the property.  Shortly after arriving Lily, who is also helping teach art at a local elementary school, meets Mike (Kevin Alejandro of True Blood) and they begin dating.  Along with some friends they visit a local spirit medium so Lily can try to contact her sister.  But the s&eacute;ance goes awry and they end up contacting a vengeful spirit.

Lily learns shes being haunted by the spirit of another young woman who attended the school and fell prey to a psychotic killer who abducts women and severs their limbs to turn them into human marionettes.  Lily has to unravel the mystery of the murdered girl before the killer can make her his next victim.

Cassadaga isn't overflowing with scares but it does feature a mystery you can sink your teeth into with several red herrings along the way.  For a film with a tiny budget it manages to make its handful of scares count to maximum effectiveness.  In a weakly contrived sub-plot Mike is forced to end his relationship with Lily as his ex-wife wants to use her instability against him in a custody case over his daughter.  It is unneeded padding on a film that runs about 15 minutes too long.  While the supporting cast of Fletcher and Alejandro is strong, Kelen Coleman in the lead role as Lily doesnt have the acting chops to carry most of the action as she is being asked to do.",1390608000,,1646,4.561224489795919
5040099,3,B006ZAPSBK,"Just looking at the cover of Cassadaga got me interested enough to purchase it, especially after watching the Criminal Minds TV episode with a similar creepy story line. A psycho kidnapping people to turn them into living marionette dolls?!  Freaky! But in Cassadaga you only get to see less than ten minutes showcasing that juicy plot. Instead, most of the movie focuses on a young deaf woman who deals with mystery clues slowly given by a ghost she's trying to help. There's also a newly divorced father she dates for a minute who turns out to be just another unheroic dud who had no necessity in the movie whatsoever. I liked how she eventually dealed with the serial killer at the very end, but a lot of the movie crept too slowly to the action and that started to bore me. Overall, I would say this movie is worth viewing once but don't expect too much.",1390089600,2,858,4.5

5040101,4,B006ZAPSBK,"Cassadaga is not a bad horror movie. Certainly, the movie's killer takes an original and macabre approach. Poe would have been proud (although no one involved is a master of horror). Throughout, Cassadaga is the rare horror movie that uses the gruesome and the gross well. Sometimes, gore can actually be scary. Furthermore, the script develops the characters decently. The audience actually cares about the characters in peril. The audience understands their motives and empathizes with them. Merits acknowledged, the film does suffer from some standard plotting and some lack of logic. But, many films have those drawbacks. Horror fans should enjoy this one once they have a chance.",1385942400,,684,5.284403669724771
5040102,4,B006ZAPSBK,"The film opens up with a young boy (Garrett Boyle) being disciplined by his mother (Janine Klein) for dressing up as a girl and playing with dolls. This leads to a self mutilation. We then move to the present, some unspecified years later. Lily (Kelen Coleman) is a deaf art teacher. Her sister (Sarah Sculco) speaks French then gets hit by a bus causing Lily to leave her job and relocate at Cassadaga, a Florida town known for its psychics.

Here she meets Mike (Kevin Alejandro) the father of a student. She teaches for Mrs. Anderson (Louise Fletcher) whose recluse grandson Thomas (Lucas Beck) likes to polish his furniture while watching Internet porn. After contacting a local psychic (Avis-Marie Barnes), a portal opens which allows an angry spirit to come through and haunt Lily.

The film was interesting as you see a plot and a slightly confusing minor subplot of the past. The film was done well, but is far from a classic. It lacked cohesion. The film takes 45-50 minutes to develop which was fine, but really needed an extra 10-15 minutes of horror factors where it was light.

Worth a rental price. 3 1/2 Amazon stars seems about right.

5040104,4,B006ZAPSBK,"I'm not sure why anyone would think this movie was boring or a waste of time. It started out leading me into the characters, with me immediately liking them all. Kelen Coleman immediately had me liking her character, and she is amazingly loveable as an actress. Kevin Alejandro is very believable in his role. Maybe this isn't the torture porn many were hoping for. It's a murder, psycho mystery horror flick with a good bit of supernatural undertones to it, that had me caring about the characters early on.
I would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes just the right amount of mystery, horror, gore and ghosty stuff, without going over the top on any of it.",1384646400,,669,4.677966101694915

5040108,2,B006ZAPSBK,"I've seen a lot of movies in the supposedly spooky genre lately that seem to be a simple montage of recent horror films pieced together to make ""another"" horror flick.  Another viewer mentioned coherence as a trait that was missing, and that really sums it up.  There are no really creepy scenes . . . No gradual build up of tension . . . No feelings of despair that a viewer can relate too.  I just found myself watching ""at"" this movie, with my attention wandering off to my iPad or to my cat or anything else to get through what turned out to be a boring experience.  I rented it hoping for a good spooky movie that night but was disappointed.  Horror movies must make money for producers because people like the genre.  But they are making too many without putting some strict novelty and good story lines into the product.",1382400000,10,827,4.407894736842105

5040110,2,B006ZAPSBK,"Rented this movie more on a lark than anything else. Living in Florida, I recently traveled to the actual location Cassadaga and the level of ""kitsch"" is pretty thick. Based on having both Louise Fletcher and Kevin Alejandro in the film, I thought the film would be a fun night in.
It starts off a little stilted, with a big ""getcha"" moment that sets what could be a great film but sadly, I find the rest of the movie doesn't live up to the hype. The storyline is easy enough to follow, but the acting is dry and jerky, as though this were the first run-through of the script instead of the final product.
The actors seemingly do little more than go one scene to the next in a barely coherent storyline that reveals itself (at least to me) about 1/4 of the way through the film. There are several attempts at being coherent, and it has moments of what might pass for acting but, overall ... this movie is a complete pass.",1381536000,,921,4.329479768786127
5040111,5,B006ZAPSBK,"Just finished watching the Cassadaga, and i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the great work. It held my attention from the beginning to end. I liked everything about this film.. the storyline was great... the site locations was fabulous,... excellent photography... fantastic editing and production... and the actors and actresses were great! I especially liked the very attractive actress who played Lily (Kelen Coleman).. quite a stunning figure and her boyfriend Mike played by Kevin Alejandro. Lily is very pretty (looks like sarah butler in ISOYG)  and did a superb job of playing the female lead of this film. she kept my interest the whole way through the film. there is a special attraction between lily and mike and they hit if off right off the bat. There is a love scene between the two of them that is quite provocative... would have been better if a bit longer. the storyline goes like this... a young boy who has a fascination with female matinees and dresses as a girl grows up with a fixation of using live girls as his captive puppets. He goes around kidnapping and drugging his victims in the basement of his greenhouse.  Lily is going through some mentally rough times with the death of her close friend and seeks the help of a local fortune teller. Several local girls from the all girls school are kidnapped and used as playthings for this disturbed psycho. Lily is soon taken from the back of a cruiser and taken to his dungeon where he is waiting...(a brutal jump in the film goes from her being taken from the car dressed in shirt and jeans.. and then redressed in a awful girls dress.. bet some film footage hit the floor in this scene?). next she escapes and runs for safety, as the psycho is shot to death. After the credits there is a scene where she again sees her boyfriend playing baseball... and i wonder if this is a lead up for another future part. one can only hope that if there is another film made it will have both Kelen Coleman and Kevin Alejandro staring in it.
overall an excellent film that i give a full 5 stars to it... great movie that would be a hit for both guys and gals.",1381449600,2,2138,4.521963824289406

8506854,2,B006ZAPSBK,"One of Florida's lesser known attractions is the town of Cassadaga, located about halfway between Orlando and Daytona Beach somewhat off the beaten path. Cassadaga's claim to fame is that it is home to one of the world's largest assemblage of psychics, mediums, and spiritualists, all plying their trades in that one location. I've often felt that the town would make a great setting for a paranormal film, so I decided to watch ""Cassadaga"" in the hopes that the filmmakers could take advantage of the locale. I guess I'm not a very good psychic, because ""Cassadaga,"" which is both a paranormal film and a slasher film, isn't very good as either.

The film's heroine, Lily (Kelen Coleman) is an art teacher whose only family, her younger sister Michele, is killed in an accident in the movie's first ten minutes. An emotionally devastated Lily accepts a job at Cassadaga University (the film isn't very clear if she's a teacher or a student), whose dean (Louise Fletcher) gives Lily a place to stay in her own home. She also soon acquires a hunky EMT boyfriend Mike (Kevin Alejandro), who takes her to a seance where she hopes to communicate with the ghost of her dead sister. Instead, she winds up making a connection with the ghost of a murdered woman. To try to figure out why the ghost is so upset, Lily starts playing Nancy Drew and soon discovers that the woman disappeared several years earlier without a trace. What the audience knows by now is that the vengeful ghost is one of several victims of a serial killer known as Geppetto, who likes to saw off women's limbs while they are still alive and then reattach them, turning the unfortunate victims into human marionettes.

Fortunately for most viewers, the low budget of ""Cassadaga"" precludes the type of special effects needed to convincingly show all the gruesome details of Geppettos work, so most of the mutilation is merely suggested. Unfortunately for most viewers, any actual scares in the movie are also precluded, this time by a general lack of talent by the writers and director, Anthony DiBlasi. To generate shocks, DiBlasi primarily uses a handful of sudden inserts of a young woman in rather gruesome makeup, supposedly the appearance of the ghost, and that's it. Instead of horror, the film takes what might have been a moderately interesting movie about a woman starting over after a family tragedy and drags it out for nearly two hours.

Coleman and Alejandro are reasonably talented actors, and, of course, Fletcher, who is on screen for maybe five minutes, is an Oscar winner, so the acting in ""Cassadaga"" is a cut above what youll find in most movies of this nature. But it's soon clear that the filmmakers have no real idea what type of movie they want to make (the seance is ludicrous), and ""Cassadaga"" lurches from drama to paranormal thriller to mystery (the identity of the killer is actually disguised fairly well) to slasher-style horror and back, never really succeeding at anything other than confusing the audience.

Cassadaga has another big problem as well. In her very first scene, Lily reveals that she is deaf, and, a couple of times during the movie, she tells people they have to look at her so she can read their lips. But her deafness has nothing to do with the movie itself and, instead, serves as a major distraction. During the seance, I kept wondering exactly how she was supposed to hear any ghosts talking to her. To make matters worse, director DiBlasi never actually directs the actors as if Lily were really deaf. She has no speech impediment and shes not concentrating on their lips, but instead, both she and the people she is talking to frequently look away (or at least at fairly sharp angles) from each other, yett she never has a problem understanding them. Needless to say, the fact I was preoccupied with watching the direction in which the actors' heads were pointed indicates that ""Cassadaga"" has major problems.

Due to its cast, Cassadaga is a bit better than most of the microscopically budgeted horror shlock that goes directly to video. But the movie completely botches any attempts at horror and, amazingly, fails to take any advantage of its arcane setting. There are no scenes or even establishing shots in the town of Cassadaga other than showing a single road sign, and the scenery, although scenic backwoods Florida, is otherwise completely generic. So too is the movie. You don't have to be a psychic to pass up Cassadaga.",1466467200,,4452,4.81437908496732

8506856,4,B006ZAPSBK,"As unique a beginning as you'll find in a horror flick, truly a shock.  I probably enjoyed it a five, though I'll grade it a four.  I'm pretty forgiving in this genre and believed in all the characters throughout.  Though some horror tropes were used, it was obvious that the producers and director didn't overly rely on them to tell the story.  The use of the greenhouse and the various clues were well done and the actress playing the main character did an excellent job in a difficult role.  The slight flaws I overlooked were the evil ghost, which was pretty much your stereotypical depiction of a not-ready-to-pass-on apparition, and the boyfriend, who didn't really add much to the story, though his young daughter was meant to be indicative of the sister the main character lost and felt guilty about.  But cinematography was great- as I'm assuming the budget was less than desired- and the story well-written, with a surprisingly touching ending in which some closure was provided.  A better buy than the majority of horror fare ought there.",1455753600,,1049,4.826815642458101
