174919,5,1401926339,"I greatly enjoyed ""THE SHIFT"" (which was originally named AMBITION TO MEANING--and no reason to give it 4 stars instead of 5 but whatever).  As I watched the movie, it touched me in many different ways.  It brought to the surface strong emotions, which I interpret to mean that my soul agreed with what Dr. Dyer was relaying in the movie.  It's a simple movie, deep with meaning.  Since I've watched it, I have felt a shift take place, taking place.  I can best describe it as an underlying feeling of ""all is well-ness"" as you go through your day despite the  problems and issues I may be dealing with.  It's not like you have this perpetual smile on your face and the birds are singing, etc.  More of an inner awakening and true knowing that God is in the details and flowing through your life.  BEAUTIFUL.  I believe that the more I let this ""flow"" become a bigger presence in my life that the strength of my fears will diminish.  Be joyful and RISE.",1246233600,26,953,4.388571428571429
174920,5,1401926339,I really enjoyed the DVD and to have the expanded version was great it gave me an inside view of all the individuals and Dr Dyer in an informal setting.  I loved it.,1244073600,15,165,4.0
174921,4,1401926339,"First of All, I love Wayne Dyer and I own everyone of his books, CD's, wisdom cards and now DVD's  etc. He is an amazing teacher. I cannot for the life of me understand why his previous movie, ""Ambition to Meaning"" was sold under the new title, ""The Shift"".  Hay House (where I made my purchase) should have made it clear that it was the same movie re-packaged. Nowhere was that mentioned in the write-up. Now I have two of the same and I really felt duped. I'm very careful these days where I place my money and it should not have happened. Yes, it's forgiveable!",1243900800,118,564,4.311320754716981
174922,4,1401926339,"This is an expanded version of the DVD ""Ambition to Meaning"". It contains the same movie along with some extras and interviews. It is not a totally new DVD.",1243296000,10,156,4.413793103448276
174923,4,1401926339,I'll be honest I haven't watch more than the first 5 minutes. Only because the first 5 minutes of the movie was the same as a movie I bought 2 months ago called Ambition to Meaning.  I just read on a different review that it's an expanded version of Ambition to Meaning but maybe next time they can keep the title and say new expanded version.,1243209600,47,343,4.196969696969697

174955,5,1401926339,"I ""inhaled"" everything Wayne wrote or spoke when he was alive, and so it continues.  I admired his ability to explain extremely complex beliefs and to distill them down to livable standards.  The Shift is an exercise in living what you believe.  He was able to remember so much of what he read and integrate what resonated with him into his life.  Incredible man.  Incredible book.",1503619200,,381,4.712121212121212

174960,5,1401926339,"Dr. Dyer produced this as a going away message to those seeking answers/solutions to today's confusing inner personal challenges. The video shows how perception and change give rise to unexpedited opportunity when a person is open and accepting to change. Many spiritual undercurrents at last allowed to flow into the physical world where ""The Shift"" is recognised and embraced by the individual. This not an idiotic Hollywood story!  Dr. Dyer created this story and illustrated message as he knew he was dying from a terminal illness.  His priceless gift is his message of hope through personal awareness and actions.",1496793600,2,618,5.232323232323233
174961,3,1401926339,"Although I'm a fan of Dr. Dyer, this DVD was shot in a bizarre way, almost as if Dr. Dyer was mocking the filming of this. We see Dr. Dyer literally being interviewed by a film crew with (staged?) interruptions (e.g. cellphone rings, boom operator comments out loud, etc.) while situated stories displaying the morals behind Dr. Dyer's wisdom roll with Dr. Dyer's occasional voice-over. The situated stories play out in an odd way (almost similar to a video you'd see from a company's training program on how to behave at work). Those situated stories are somewhat distracting, though they're meant to be examples of what Dr. Dyer discusses in the video.

I'd rather see a real lecture on DVD from Dr. Dyer on public television (e.g. from KCET, PBS, etc.).",1495584000,,756,4.770992366412214
174962,5,1401926339,"Dr Dyer danged my life.  At a time in my life that I was really low,  I started reading Dr Dyer.  His teachings and writings helped  me at a time when I thought my life was meaningless and useless,  he made me realive we all have value just because of who we are.

Dr. Dyers books are always very easy to understand. He even provides steps that can be followed in order to make this shift. This is a companion book to the movie of the same name. I highly recommend this book.",1471046400,2,473,4.436781609195402

175006,5,1401926339,"This movie doesn't have the action, visual candy, and thumping soundtracks of most mainstream films; what it has is heart, a beautiful practical wisdom we can come back to year after year, and a sweetness and gentleness that is missing from most films. This is a movie with meaning and helps you to remember what it is to be human. The messages / themes in The Shift are generalized enough to appeal to many people living in North America.

The piano music of Christopher Ferreira is touching, and the light-hearted lytics by Ethan Lipton also help to give this movie a lightness and friendly feel. I recommend this movie to the undergraduate students who I am fortunate enough to teach (and who teach me) as part of an extra credit assignment. When I read their papers, most say how watching this film helped them to remember some key truths that they had forgotten, were grateful to have heard again, and for some of them - because they're ready - it helps them to begin to change their lives for the better.

Namaster Wayne and to the cast and crew for funding and making this film, and to Hay House for publishing the accompanying book.",1461369600,,1140,4.583333333333333

They were his truth, and I personally feel they spoke directly to me--most of the time.  The Shift is perhaps the one oration that I continue to have problems with (doubt)--and he, of course, in his all-knowing way, warned us we would.  I know he's right about how it feels to shift; I did turn my life around once--completely--and I loved it!  Of course, I hadn't a penny and could earn nothing at it, which made me have to shift back to a prior age--for survival.  If I look at it as a future challenge, however, I completely support Wayne's view in The Shift.  It is obvious that I'm not yet as ascendant as he was.",1449532800,,754,4.201388888888889

You'll have realizations, you'll know you are no longer disconnected from your Source and it has nothing to do with being separate from anyone and it's has nothing to do with just YOU. It has to do with helping, serving, solving problems/pain/suffering of others all over the Universe. I can say that the pieces that you have been missing will come to you. Something else is connecting to your Guardian Angels if your have an open heart and mind to do so. There is so much that can be said regarding the book and the movie.

Putting focus on a purpose on our lives (internal) is something we do not get taught in our lives since the focus is  primarily on education, work and taking care of our family (nothing wrong with all this). However, as we get older, we all need to look at finding the true purpose in our lives which is what Dr Dyer is talking about. Living a life of purpose, compassion and love for all beings (not just human) and to protect our planet from destruction is something that we can all benefit from.

175110,5,1401926339,"One of my all time favorite inspirational movies.

So many people today are feeling a pull to find greater meaning in their lives. It's no longer about how much stuff you can accumulate, how many people you feel better than or how important you can make yourself feel by being busy and being stressed.

The Shift is a movie about making of a movie--Wayne Dyer's information on moving from ambition to meaning--intertwined with three intertwined stories of lives we can relate to. The director of the film whose career is disintegrating in front of his eyes, a dedicated mother of two young boys who yearns feel her own personal fulfillment and an affluent and successful couple whose identities and lives revolve around money and success. The film crew and staff of Asilomar, where the movie is filmed, also play important roles.

Each time I watch this movie I get something more out of it--it touches me on a deeper level and in an unconscious way. It keeps me on track with what I really want in live--to be the very best version of ME and to be of service to others.

For me, the DELUXE version is the best. It has the interview with Dr. Dyer that the movie is based on as well as additional questions and commentaries. And it has the music video that is fun too. I really like Ethan Lipton's songs in the movie. They are fun and funny.

If you are feeling that pull to have more meaning in your life, this movie will inspire you and maybe even give you some ideas on how you too can shift your life for the better.",1436227200,2,1519,4.43010752688172

175154,5,1401926339,"Ive found that every spiritual advance Ive made was preceded by some sort of a fall  in fact, its almost a universal law that a fall of some kind precedes a major shift.

THIS was the sentence that stopped me cold in my reading of Wayne Dyers new book, The Shift: Taking your Life from Ambition to Meaning.

I was reading  and loving  this book, a companion book to Dr. Dyers movie of the same name, The Shift, that came out last year.  I watched and enjoyed that movie then and   loyal Wayne Dyer fan that I am  always intended to re-watch it so I could take notes on his always wise observations on life.  I never got around to that.

I was relieved when I heard he had written a companion book  How considerate of him to realize that we frustrated note-takers would appreciate a summary of everything he said in the movie.  I was so involved in the stories in the film  the stories that illustrate, in each case, a characters or a couples fall, or near destruction as a result of the egos  striving   to a choice for meaning  and love  in each characters life.

As I read the book, I arrived at that passage and stopped to reflect  Yes, thats exactly how its gone for me  personal and career falls, followed by a yearning for something more, a shift to something greater in my spirit, that often resulted in some beautiful revelation about myself or the world or the Universe, or God, Himself  and generated a transformation of my own world view, my own Being  so that the competition I felt before transformed into willingness, the judgment transformed into empathy and compassion, and the feeling of Ive got to make this happen transformed into surrender to the God of my mind and heart.

Dr. Dyers new book, besides being the companion book to The Shift movie, is also a lovely sort-of handbook to his spiritual philosophy   not an in-depth  analysis of the Tao Te Ching that his previous book, Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life  is,  nor a how-to book like Excuses Begone!: How to Change Lifelong, Self-Defeating Thinking Habits, both of which I also read and liked very much.

 The Shift is a synopsis of a spiritual world view grounded in purpose and meaning.

It is, at 112 pages, a short book for Wayne Dyer, and for that, a very appealing one.  Dr. Dyer gets to his point quickly  a life based in ego thoughts can never be ultimately satisfying, given, as the ego is, to always wanting more. And, then, the dreaded sentence: a fall of some kind precedes a major shift.  Somehow or other, there is some kind of fall  a set-back, a disappointment, a divorce  or almost one, losing a job or a project  something that takes us down so low that there is a danger of losing our way in life.  It is often at those low points that we see something we never saw before.

What is possible to see in those falls is that there IS another way  a way that leads to fulfillment and joy   finding, or suddenly realizing, ones purpose.

Dr. Dyers books always seem to come to me at just the right time in my life  I often get the feeling that he sits in his study in Maui writing just for me.  I think his message this time could very possibly be for the entire world.

Weve just been through a financial crisis  one marked by the drive of greed, ambition, and cut-throat competition  all ear-marks of the ego gone wild.  If this isn't a fall, I don't know what is.

What do we do now?  Dr. Dyer paints a clear choice.  We can either go back to the ego driven world we had before  and, I say, there are signs that is happening in many quarters.  Or, as Dr. Dyer suggests, we can look within, and find those places where we can make a difference  and look to serve an end beyond ourselves.

The journey to Meaning, Dr. Dyer asserts, is to raise our consciousness from our own material wants and desires and find that for which we came  to serve others, to serve humanity, to serve the world.

Dr. Dyers message is,  making the shifts to humility, trust, and letting go feel natural because were rejoining our original nature.  A life of meaning is only a thought away.

What will you choose?

I am no longer the fan of his that I used to be... he has killed it for me by obviously hopping on the scamming money-wagon!

175160,4,1401926339,"I really enjoyed Wayne Dyer's latest book, Wishes fulfilled, but I found this one a bit hard going and difficult to get into, hence the four instead of five stars.

Wayne discusses the shift ""from ambition to meaning"" which is also the topic of his film of the same name. At first it was not easy to find out what he was really talking about. The phrase ""ambition to meaning"" seemed a little abstruse, and terming one chapter ""From"" and another ""To"" seemed a bit strange though understandable. Particularly the first chapter was not very readable from my point of view.

He begins by discoursing on our transition from Nonbeing to Being, spirit into form. I found this difficult to comprehend because surely we come from God, Source, or whatever we would term it, and is this not absolute Being? How can God be Nonbeing? I myself had an amazing out-of-body experience when I was 14, where I experienced being what I felt was ""a cell in the body of God/the Universe"". I felt this as pulsating blissful Being, bathed in a golden light, a state where there was no time and no death - there was nothing ""Nonbeing"" about it.

Wayne talks at length of nothingness, oneness and surrender, all worthy, basic and relevant concepts.

He provides inspiring and relevant citations from the Tao Te Ching, A Course in Miracles, Nisargadatta Maharaj, who is apparently his teacher, Longfellow, Tagore, White Eagle, T.S. Eliot and even Rabbie Burns from my homeland.

Chapter Two deals with ""Ambition"", which he says arises from our false self. When we ""emerge from the world of spirit"", we develop ego or the false self, whereas previously we ""allowed ourselves to be lived by the great Tao"". Wayne here discusses the six lies the ego wants us to believe: 1) Who I am is what I have 2) Who I am is what I do 3) Who I am is what others think of me 4) I am separate from everyone else 5) I am separate from what's missing in my life, and finally 6) I am separate from God.

It is well worth refreshing our acquaintance with these belief systems which our upbringing and culture inclines us to adopt, but which we subsequently need to get rid of.

In chapter Three we are reminded to make a U-turn back to our place of origin and fulfill our dharma by finding the meaning of our life. It doesn't matter where we are on our ""journey"", but only which direction we are headed.

Our desired U-turn consists of shifting to personal empowerment, seeing ourselves connected to everyone, being motivated by ""ethics, serenity, and quality of life"", shifting to the possibility or even expectation of miracles being a part of life, practising meditation, beginning to ""recognize ourselves in nature's beauty and intricacy"", becoming less judgmental, and more able to understand and forgive.

Wayne also includes an interesting section on quantum change.

Chapter Four deals with Meaning, which is our goal. We return to the place we originated and know it for the first time.

He elaborates on the four cardinal virtues ""that constitute our original nature"". These are 1) reverence for all life 2) natural sincerity 3) gentleness 4) supportiveness,

Basically, the book deals with the shift to ""the path of a meaningful and purposeful life"". This includes 1) the shift from entitlement to humility 2) the shift from control to trust 3) the shift from attachment to letting go. All these shifts are essential.

In ""Wishes fulfilled"", Wayne referred to Anita Moorjani's book ""Dying to be me"", describing her extremely serious bout with cancer, after which she experienced an NDE with subsequent complete healing. I have now read this book in which Anita explains that she feels her cancer was caused by her leading a life with a completely false self, always doing things for others even though this did not feel right and being unable to show or be who she really was. This fits in with Wayne's thesis in this book about the need to get rid of the false self that most of us have taken on.

To sum up, this is a valuable book, just not the most readable of the author's books, and initially a little hard to get into. I found the final two chapters to be the best, and much more readable than the first two, but this may just be my own subjective opinion.

I love Wayne's erudition, love, kindness, generosity, great work with himself, and his life path of informing others of how they too best can work on their personal and spiritual development. I enjoin you to read this book too and all his books.",1377302400,2,4473,4.658629441624366

175179,5,1401926339,"Having read every book that Dr. Wayne Dyer has written it is always interesting to see that he has once again found a way to assert his beliefs differently and engagingly. I remember an interview when he was speaking of creating this particular book before having named it, The Shift.  He referred to it as From Ambition to Meaning.  Carl Jung has been perhaps his biggest influence and it shows in this book as he alludes to the stages of our lives.  Dyer separates ego from heart basically and attributes ego as our driving ambition which often leads us down unsatisfying roads and explains why often things run amok.  At the same time, he explains after he's listed the shifts we are making, that all is circular.
We begin with ambition (goal oriented and physical) and progress to spirit (more consciousness and mindfulness) and then, if we're lucky and know how to look, we find meaning, inferring this is the ultimate because at that point, no matter our circumstances, we have peace of mind.
I like the brevity of this book, the quotes he uses to support his comments and I feel good when I've finished digesting this book, that my life has been enriched by his insightful anecdotes and that I am indeed closer to being my authentic self.

175217,4,1401926339,"I am quite critical of movies, hard to please.  The more I learned about the art of writing screenplays, the more critical I became.  Now, it's easy to criticize a finished product that you rented for $4.25, not so easy to face that blank page when all you know is that you want to write a movie.  Not so easy to write and sell the script.  Not so easy to get the funding to make it into a film.  Not so easy to hire actors and crew.  Not so easy to make it all come together.  Understanding all of this, am I to judge this movie, which has the production value of an after school special, as though it were a major theatrical release?

Do I mention that almost every scene needed a rewrite?  Do I mention that the heavy-handed message of the film seriously NEEDED to be buried in an invisible plot and more complex characters?  Do I mention the lusterless acting?  Regardless of yes or no, I've already mentioned it.

So, if the message of this film is clearly the only reason for the film coming into being, and therefore if the story itself is superfluous, let's touch on the message.  Let's see who experiences it and what they learn.

This movie edifies a rich couple who experience marital conflict, too much materialism, not enough interpersonal relating; and a middle-class family of four, with the mother managing all the responsibility, none her artistic desire finding fruition; and a struggling film technician who cannot push his career forward, who must instead interview a new-age guru named Wayne Dyer, whom the technician considers to be a Pollyanna.  Interestingly, the film is not about Wayne Dyer.  Wayne Dyer simply plays himself, Wayne Dyer, who is the mentor of the other characters.  He's the guy with all the answers.  A movie is never about a guy with all the answers.  Well, unless that guy happens to be Ferris Bueller, and it happens to be the main character's day off.

The answers (The Message) of the film are #1 quiet your ego, #2 stop fighting for status, #3 allow your natural Godliness to shine through, #4 answer your personal calling in life, regardless of what others think, and #5 allow abundance to show up in your life.  I'm paraphrasing.  I'm putting it all very simply, but (#6) simplicity is also a message in the film.  Like my father used to say to me, ""Keep it simple, stupid.""

If you're looking for popcorn entertainment (nothing wrong with that!), don't bother with this product. As a movie, it could have been much better.  In order to value the DVD, you have to be open and willing to receive the kind psychological and spiritual message that Dr. Wayne Dyer has been developing for decades.

If you're a Dyer fan, if you enjoy his books, audiobooks, and seminars, you will probably enjoy the movie.  You will probably look past all the mediocre storytelling and look kindly upon the fact that Dyer's information is getting out there.  If you liked The Secret and What The [Bleep] Do We Know?, you will probably enjoy this movie.  If you're a person who is looking to change his or her thinking--and therefore his or her life--you will probably enjoy The Shift.

Dr. Wayne Dyer is a remarkable man, even considering (especially considering) all of the egocentric criticism he has faced (some of it coming from me), and I appreciate his effort and the efforts of the moviemakers to bring his worldview to a broader audience.  With that said, there is nothing new in The Shift.  Dyer tends to say the same things over and over again, each time with a new slant.  I now see the light: he does this for a reason.  He's not copping out.  He's doing his fans a service.

In order to make the lifestyle shift that The Shift proposes, one should watch the movie repeatedly until it sinks in.  Listen to Dyer's audiobooks.  Listen to the words of others, all offering similar advice.  As Dyer told the film technician in The Shift, it's not something you can understand all at once.  In my case, I had to ""call bull-shite on that"" several times before I actually started to KNOW the validity of the message.

Dr. Dyer cares about helping people.  This movie does, too.  Although it is a mediocre production, it carries a great message, and ultimately--based on that--it deserves four stars.",1354147200,,4233,4.617962466487936
175218,4,1401926339,"This is an excellent self-help movie.

It takes about 10 minutes to get into it... but as soon as dyer begins it's magical.

I saw it twice: once with an enthusiastic group of individuals -- the other with a group of skeptics. Needless to say, it was much more enjoyable the first time.

Dyer really has some information to share... here are some ideas:

1: we are born with everything we need -- but somewhere along the lines we must rely upon others... however, in doing so we learn NOT to trust ourselves...

2: We start EDGING GOD OUT with the ego. On the other hand, we can bring god back into our life and experience more fulfillment and joy.

3: Problems begin when we focus on: what we have, who we are supposed to be, and our reputation.

This weekend I was doing some things around the house when all of a sudden I thought ""I should watch 'The Shift.'"" I hadn't seen it for close to a year.

I am also an avid follower of the Teaching of Abraham by Jerry and Esther Hicks. This film has touched and lifted my soul back to a divine level  I  experienced as a child. I was fortunate to have been brought up in a loving Christian environment within which the virtues Dr Dyer discusses in the film of Respect, Honesty, Kindness and Service that were taught to me as a matter of course through parables and pray.

I have always been of service to people, achieving tremendous success. But I have always wanted to help those who have suffered through the recent financial crisis. After years of failure to get the project off the ground this dvd has given me ease and allowed me find the solutions to completing the foundations of my project.

A friend of mine told me to get this DVD.  He showed it to his step-daugher as she was graduating college.  He wanted to help her realize what is important in life.  Wayne really resonated with me when he speaks to the pressures women are under.  We have to be the perfect daughter, the athlete and then smart college girl.  However when you enter the job market you are seen as temporary regardless of your ambition simply because you can have children.  If you are aggressive and know what you want then you are labeled a B*&&H.

The housewife featured in the movie who is torn between her art and her family is really a simple and beautiful way to show this labelling.  Our children (speaking to the women here) really don't know who we are as a person because we are living the label of mom and housewife.  We sacfrice ourselves, willingly, to make our family happy.

175253,5,1401926339,"p. 28 Let go and let God.  When you practice surrender on a daily basis, everything seems to fall into place.

p. 34-35 Ego insists that we traverse from nothing to something, from being no one to being someone, from oneness to twoness, from unity to separation.  (This is why as a champion runner- I sensed the disconnect of success)... Ego wants us to be a somebody who is more important than the other somebodies!

p. 42-43 If we are what we do, then when we don't or can't, we aren't.  (This is why shin splints forced me to let go of ego-identity as runner.)

p. 45 Throughout life, we're bombarded by ego messages attempting to convince us that our worth comes from the observations and opinions of others.  (This is why I got into real estate.)

p. 45 We're Divine pieces of the whole (holographic), individualized expressions of God created out of the great void... false teachings of the ego (that we should believe the opinions of others + respect their viewpoint over our own) gradually erodes our sense of worth, causing us to doubt our Divinity.

p. 46 ...trying to be the person they want us to be.  We cease to exist except as a reflection of what others think.

p. 18 Herman Melville said, ""God's one and only voice is silence.""  and this is an invitation to experience our original world of nothingness.  All of creation emerges from the silent void, as does every sound.  Every bit of light comes from nothingness, every thought emerges from nonthought.

p. 19 Lao-tzu (Tao Te Ching) placed emphasis on knowing the great Tao (God) by giving up everything, letting go of all attachments, doing less, owning nothing, and practicing getting to know God by emptying rather than filling the mind.  Almost every great spiritual master tells us to find God in emptiness, and to hear God speak to us in silence.

p. 53 If there's no place that God is not, then God is in each of us, as well as in everything that our senses interpret as missing from our life.  This means that in some invisible manner, were connected (holographic universe) to everything we perceive to be missing.  The question might then be, how do we manifest the things we desire that appear to be unavailable?  The answer is to realign ourselves in a way that allows what we seek to spiritually harmonize with us.

p. 55 God (Spirit or Tao) is everywhere.  Therefore, God is in me.  God is in everything I perceive to be missing.  Conclusion: I am connected by spirit to everything I view as missing.  Suggested Action: Align with Spirit and see that what appears to be missing begins to show up.

Naturalist John Muir said, ""When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.""

connectedness to everyone and everything
resting in onesness
we're a piece of God

p. 90 The more we demand from the universe, the more is demanded of us.  The more we give away, the more is given to us.  It's truly a simple matter of attitudinal energy generated from within ourselves.  Consistently thinking of needing more attracts that needy energy back to us.  When we consistently generate thoughts of giving, however, we attract the energy of giving back to us.

Both direction and editing are superb.  The music track is also quite good and the ending song delightful.

If enough people understand the need to move from ego to service we may yet have a chance to get out of this global quagmire, and if not at least you will be peaceful with whatever is going on in the outside world.",1290038400,,457,4.3882352941176475
175264,5,1401926339,"I bought the book, but when I watched the video- it made a unforgettable lasting impression.",1288656000,,92,4.8125
175265,4,1401926339,"Dr. Wayne Dyer is an extremely personable man.  He is the embodiment of the work he does.  He lives what he teaches.  And you get a very strong sense of this in his ""documovie"".

The premise starts with Dr. Wayne Dyer being interviewed by a video production team, where Wayne talks about some of the key ideas from his latest work.  It's then framed around several different groups of people with their own particular circumstances (a family, an affluent couple, and the video team).  This is interleaved around the interviewing of Wayne throughout the movie.

The acting is very good.  Each person seems to have a natural synergy with the others.  The actors portray very believable personalities.  There is... well, there's a ""shift"" that happens with those people, each with their own catalyst.  But the shifts seem to happen a bit too quickly to be believable.  There's not enough of a ""pull"" to the catalyst and time enough to germinate the change of mind.  Like a man so set in his ways on not having children, only to find that his wife is pregnant and wants the child).  Or a guy who is so consumed with his business, is suddenly free of concern.

But if you can look beyond that, you'll enjoy seeing these individual shifts take place.

Incidentally, this 2-DVD set consist of the movie on disc 1 and interviews with Wayne on disc 2, along with additional movie scenes and ""music videos"".  The interviews contain a lot of the content which was used to author the movie.  So, it's all very familiar and similar to what Wayne talks about in the movie.  There is some content within the interviews that doesn't make it to the movie ""directly"", so it's worthwhile to watch them.  But I'd look at this more like a supplement, rather than an entirely fresh set of extra material.

The only beef I have with Dr. Dyer is his stance on ego.  He's very negative about it, actually.  ""Is there a purpose to the ego?  It's not worth defending.  The ego is the false self.  Your authentic self is way beyond the ego.""  Well if that's the case, then why do we have an ego?  I think Dyer is missing something... It's not that the ego is false, not authentically you.  It's about HOW your ego is focused, the learned perspective.  Our culture and parents help shape our ego.  And our consumption centric culture is unfortunately pushing us in an unhealthy direction.  ""Greed is good"" is not a healthy motto.  So we have to unlearn what we've come to believe as the priorities for a desirable life, and reframe our priorities towards what Dr. Dyer is teaching.

The other thing is a contradiction in one of Dyer's basic principles.  He says in the extra material, ""I write because writing is what I am; it's in my heart.  And if I can't do that, then I would feel incomplete.  I would almost feel like I would die.  It would be no longer any reason to live.""  And yet... he has been quoted as saying ""You are not what you have, you are not what you do, you are not your reputation.  You are the Divine, you are connected to God, and you have reconnected to your Source in such a way that it is really God working through you, or you working with God.""  So if he couldn't write, he should be able to find something else to do... and yet, he says outright that he would be incomplete and would feel like dying.  Given how ""The Shift"" is one of his later works, you'd expect he would have the more positive outlook...  Strange.

You can realize what you desire if you just let it happen, be open to the possibilities.  I wasn't sure if I'd find this DVD set helpful, so I had the realization that I could borrow it from the library first.  I did... and it's definitely something worth having in your own video library.  Whenever you need a little philosophical inspiration in your life, this is a great outlet.",1286496000,5,3799,4.470845481049563
175266,5,1401926339,"I loved watching this movie and wanted to share it with my closest friends and children, so I ordered it for others.",1286409600,,116,4.318181818181818
175267,3,1401926339,"I'm watching the film right now and one thing that bothers me is this view of Wayne Dyer on 'how come women and men play out these certain rolls (men have to provide, women have to be caring)'. He blaims 'society' for it - people get pushed into these rolls by other people who got pushed into these rolls by other people, and so on. Where's the animal instinct? Men and women act the way they do because we're mammals and just like all the other mammals we have instincts which 'tell' us how to behave. It's that simple. When you feel you're in danger, for instance, you either run, keep still, fight - which, interestingly enough, as is the case with many of these 'instinctive behaviours' (or call it 'biological programs') when lasting over too long a period, become 'diseases' of so called modern humans. Like depressions (feeling that you can't escape), cancer (cells multiplying, as part of a biological program - for instance, the body provides more lung cells in order for you to be able to run harder and get a chance to escape from a preditor. Or, breast cells seemingly go crazy, but it's nature trying to enable you to produce more milk for your child when it is endangered (sick, had an accident, marries the wrong woman, etc.).

In nature, these 'biological programs' would only be active for a short time (you escape or get killed/your child lives or dies/etc.), but with us it can last for too long. This, for me, is one of the reasons I live in a way that 'stress', 'conflicts', etc., have no long time baring on me. When you realize you're steered by these instincts (the ego is mostly running these automatic programs) you can actually choose to live from another 'source' - this is called 'God', 'Higher Self', or whatever.

Letting go of controle is the hard part, 'till you realize how much fun it is! The ego, of course, won't easily let this happen. It'll tell you that you are acting in a irresponsible way, that you are being silly, throws 'scientific facts' at you (like the evolution theory, etc.). However, when you realize that the ego is restricted to a purely materialistic (causal) view, you'll get over it...

Then, the ego might play along and offer you structure for your newly discovered 'spiritual truths'. You say there's a 'God'? Okay, let's define that. 'God is good'? Hey, if that's true, how come there's so much suffering in the world? Dang - gotcha!

'Labeling', 'defining', 'causality' and 'linear reasoning' are some of the weapons of the ego. This is why it values 'science' so much. It can actually prove that the universe is made up of 'things' that behave in a predictable way (laws of nature). That is, 'till quantum science entered the game... And unexplainable stuff like 'the placebo effect', 'spontaneous reggresion', etc. The ego doesn't know how to handle that, but rather goes on explaining to you (well, to itself, actually, but if you identify with it, the ego is you...) why it's more logical to use poisonous chemo to 'fight' cancer, instead of looking at cancer in a different way.

So, for me it comes down to making a choice: live 'mechanically' (like the mule, keep chasing the carrot in front of it's nose) or 'let go of all this' (and surrender into 'something else', call it 'God', 'Higher Self', or, even better, don't call it anything, just live it).

Hope this rambling has some value for someone out there.",1286323200,9,3381,4.6644295302013425

I am left once again.. in the dark about this ""mystery force"".  Sit back and just ""let it happen"" doesn't really make it for me. If that were the case to activate this mysterious force all the people out of work would be happy & successful. Considering that is not true I feel the movie lacks content. Instead of discovering this ""force"" through hints, gestures, facial expressions, and clues.. how about just say ""how it's done"".  This movie is a spiritual journey; however Wayne had almost 2 hours to finally just say how to acquire this ""force"" outright; instead he used soft tones, his own gentleness and clue type direction to guide this movie into a drama-feel good movie.

Wayne talks about the ego being in control and in this movie there is a lot of him saying:  ""I"", ""Me"", and ""My"".  Isn't that the ego Wayne?  It easy to come from a spiritual path when all your finances have been met.  Here is a challenge for you... Wayne give all your money away, all of it, keep about $5k and then how would your spiritual path be then when money became a worry?

I gave the movie 2 stars only because the movie - feel good movie as it were is done very well.  If you are looking for answers to make ""the shift""; keep searching.  Reminds me of the pharmaceutical companies.. we don't want to cure you, we want you to keep wanting more to make us rich.

In the DVD, the story begins with a small camera crew meeting Dyer for an interview. As the interview unfolds we see other stories in the background -- a devoted mother of two young boys who nurtures everyone but herself, an overachieving husband who has forgotten what love means, and a movie director desperate for the opportunity to prove his worth. In Dyer's words, the second half of our life is when we find our unique purpose and want to contribute to the world. We then are able to make the shift from our ego to a more meaningful, focused life of serving the community and giving back. These believable characters show real people experiencing change.

I believe that once Wayne Dyer realizes this serious gaff, he will fix it.  I will happily remove this review when he advertises this correction.  I hold no grudge.

I purchased this DVD for a substantial donation to PBS.  Even with Amazon's low prices here, it is in no way cheap.  This mistake is sure to disaffect or at least irritate some of his fan base.  This is an especially troublesome situation because Wayne Dyer is a supposed purveyor of spiritual wisdom.

This movie is not only full of great ideas and philosophies to think about, it is well-written, beautifully edited and shot, and very interesting. Instead of being a documentary/lecture kind of movie, the material is presented based on real life/real stories in current time.

We are able to see how a belief in a greater spirit/god/creator (whatever you want to name it) fits into our lives. We are able to see how we are all connected to the earth and all of creation and can include in our lives down that connection and appreciate everything around us. The story and chracters are believable and the setting is beautiful.

My favorite part was hearing that ""we are born with everything we need to become fully human - we don't start out as human at conception and then become a duck or a rose bush - we become human. In that light we are also born with everything we need to become fully spiritual/fully connected, but we forget and lose that connection when we get over-involved with this world.""

Once again, this false self proclaims as truth that something or someone external to us is responsible for our validation.

175296,5,1401926339,"Recently I received in the mail a free copy of ""The Shift: Taking Your Life From Ambition to Meaning"" by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer. I had responded to a Facebook query regarding individuals who were willing to review new books published by authors under the auspices of Hay House. As a metaphysical teacher and Law of Attraction disciple, I am a long-time fan of Louise Hay, and as such I am always interested in the works published through Hay House.

I recommend this book highly to anyone who desires real change and transformation in their life. I especially recommend this book to anyone who is addicted to ""doing."" If your doing results in feelings other than peace, contentment and happiness, then you probably are experiencing some level of stress on the emotional, mental and physical level, and you probably are looking for a way to change that.

This book can help you with that.

I received this book at the perfect time in my own awakening and transformation. As of the end of February, I officially stepped into the ""to"" phase of transformation (the book is divided into four phases ~ ""From,"" ""Ambition,"" ""To,"" and ""Meaning"" ~ and the feelings of clarity, peace, relief and optimism that I experienced while reading Dr. Dyer's words, are indescribable.

Each of us comes from a place whose essence is pure ""Being."" Yet, we live in a world that over-values ""doing"" and under-values ""being."" This contrast can cause a lifetime of pain, struggle, and illness. Dr. Dyer's book characterizes this contrast through personal and anecdotal examples of relatable life situations. I was able to see myself in his words, to measure the choicepoints that I have experienced in my own life, and to measure my progress (to use a very ""doing"" term) in my own deliberate and conscious inner transformation.

In my opinion and my experience, this book illustrates beautifully how to get back to our Authentic selves, and as a result, we can do, be and have a life experience of our dreams.

I highly recommend this book.  It is on my personal ""Must Have"" listed, and I have added it to my ""Wisdom Tools"" list on my web site ([...]).",1267401600,60,2121,4.747282608695652
175297,5,1401926339,Amazing Dr. Wayne Dyer video. A great voice... a great message. Putting his ideas into practice will change your life for good.,1267142400,,127,4.818181818181818
175298,5,1401926339,"The Shift is a companion book for the movie with the same title, both of which are self-sufficient. Nonetheless, I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, as it will help you grasp much of the significance. The book doesn't give away the plot of the movie, though it refers to it once in awhile.

Like the other 30-some books by Wayne Dyer, this one is filled with inspirational quotes from famous spiritual teachers and classical holy texts, personal stories, and parables. This one, however, is only 112 pages and can be read easily in a day or two. It can be read several times and you will still get something out of it.

The original title of the book and movie was ""From Ambition to Meaning,"" and interestingly, there are only four chapters, each with one of these words. The first chapter, ""From,"" discusses the void where we came from and how in the womb, we are doing nothing but being lived by ""all creating energy that seems to do nothing, and at the same time leaves nothing undone."" Wayne cites quantum physics to validate the nothingness from whence we came. We are reminded that everything in the material world is truly like what it came from.  Ergo, we are truly spiritual beings having a temporary human experience.  And ""our real self is the loving observer of our sensory experiences."" He leads us to the conclusion that ""nonbeing and love are synonymous.""  We are given tools on how to get back to the Nothingness, such as meditation, feeling the oneness, and surrender. We are even challenged to give away one item a day, anything we do not use on a daily basis!

Before we realize that, however, nearly all of us get sucked into ""Ambition,"" which is the title of chapter 2. Here we learn how our false self develops as we identify with the ego. This entails beliefs such as ""Who I am is what I have, what I do, and what others think of me."" This ""somebody training"" involves learning more lies such as ""I am separate from everyone else, from what's missing in my life, and from God.""

In chapter 3 (""To"") we make the U-turn back to our ""fromness."" There comes a time in everyone's life when they see that the inauthentic self is a lie. This doesn't mean the loss of ambition, but rather that our drive is now directed toward a life based on meaning and purpose. Some signs that we may be ready include: the ego's ""mantra of more"" becomes less attractive; we find ourselves doing less; we shun the spotlight to work in the shadows; we believe in unity more than separateness; we begin to realize we're connected to Spirit; we begin to trust the wisdom that created us. Next, Wayne tells us what to expect and gives a 7-point summary of our U-turn.  He describes four qualities of the shift from ambition to meaning: surprising, vivid, benevolent and enduring.

In the final chapter, ""Meaning,"" Wayne tell us how he told his buddy Ram Dass many years ago, ""All of my life I wanted to be somebody. Now I finally am somebody--but it isn't me."" All the fame and wealth did not satisfy him and he didn't feel fulfilled till making the shift back to his authentic self. Wayne describes the four virtues that constitute our original nature: reverence for all life, natural sincerity, gentleness and supportiveness. ""Today,"" Wayne declares, ""my life is almost 100 percent devoted to service in one way or another. Each day begins with a prayer of `Thank you.'"" He describes the three most important things to watch for during the shift: the shift from entitlement to humility; the shift from control to trust (in yourself, others and God); and the shift from attachment to letting go.

Great little book packed with inspiration and encouragement! With the tendency we are heading in for shorter books at smaller prices, this makes a really great gift to yourself or to someone who is over 30 and perhaps beginning to question life's meaning and his/her purpose.",1266796800,102,3887,4.644832605531295

175318,3,1401926339,"""The Shift"" is a self-help ""manifesting"" movie, disguised as an interview with Dr. Wayne Dyer, within the framework of a movie about people living out the concepts Dr. Dyer talks about. All of the characters are staying in the same resort area by the ocean. While Dr. Dyer is interviewed for a fictional project within the movie, the other characters in the movie experience the concepts he has been talking about.

Yes, Dr. Dyer says some interesting things. Yes, the actors in the movie were mostly likeable. The two just didn't fit together. I felt pandered to - if I'm a good girl and listen up, I might learn something. The unfortunate thing is what I might learn is pretty obvious. For example, a workaholic, unkind, driven businessman suddenly realizes that money isn't the most important thing and that he doesn't have to work at a job he hates.

I don't imagine my opinion will be valued by Wayne Dyer fans, but I thought his role in this movie was cloying. Also, for being so spiritually evolved it seems he is getting a big head, although he downplays it and makes it seem like it isn't the case. You will either see what I mean by this, or you won't. (symbolically his head is ACTUALLY about five times bigger than anyone else's on the cover art!) I think Dr. Dyer's own ego is involved in his popularity. Oh, well, we are all human. I undoubtedly have lots of my own ego issues that caused me to notice this!

Give me a person who DOESN'T think he has all the answers to life -- but is interested in the quest -- I would love to hear him talk all day.

I agree that ""You can heal your life"" is a much more enjoyable and worthwhile film. I liked hearing from the variety of people in YCHYL and also that movie didn't pretend to be something else.

Some of the manifesting materials out in the world seem quite simplistic and full of platitudes.",1256601600,62,1856,4.431085043988269
175319,5,1401926339,"Being a big fan of Wayne Dyer I am certain that my review of this video will be biased. But I must say that I went from a disappointed viewer to caught up in the message by the end of the film.

This video has a few story lines going on at once.  All characters in each story are portraying the messages that Dyer is speaking throughout. Kind of an series of examples making the point of his message a little clearer and ""real"".  You will have to pay attention as the flow of these tales doesn't grab you like a traditional movie - at least they did not for me.

I will also admit that in the first 30 minutes, I felt that there were far too many moments that reflected the brilliance (or the not so brilliance) of a late night t.v. infomercial.  I believe this was Dyers first attempt at a movie like scenario, and at some points it showed.  It is more like a documentary within a made for t.v. movie.  A touch unnatural at times.

However, and this is a huge ""however"".....  Dyers skill in dialogue is always compelling and inspirational.  He is a true Master at relaying these ideas. So, when it comes time to deal out the stars, I cannot help but to still award him and the video a full 5.  By the end you will have no choice but to allow the message to come into your awareness, as with all of Dyer's material.

If you liked the DVD The Celestine Prophecy, I think you will like this as well.  Each is definitely unique unto itself, but I would put them in the same category in relation to delivering inspiration. I was hooked by the end as the negatives and awkwardness were elevated into ""character"".  A nice add to any home library.

Talk about having to take a pause break. Everytime he said something new, it was like eating dinner......I had to take a bite, and then chew......and chew.....and chew.......until I could swallow what it was he was saying. Then my mind would be off.

It would wander the wonderful paths that his words had formed and I found myself walking a very spiritual path. Everytime my mind wandered, it kept taking me back to one place. My favorite place, the Marina in San Leandro, California. I would see myself standing there just watching the water. Feeling the breeze move the boats behind me. Hearing the creaks of the dock, the faint whisper of sea gulls. I walked miles in my thoughts, before I realized, I needed to pause the movie and go back to what I had missed while seeing the beautiful Bay.

Halfway through the movie, my mind drifted back to the Marina, but this time my imagination soared and I saw the Dr. standing just behind me. He asked me ""Do you like it here?"" ""Yes, it's my favorite place in all of the world."" I answered never looking back at him, just keeping my eyes on the waves. ""Why?"" He said very softly, and I smiled ""Because I am here.'""  My eyes re-opened to the fact that again I was watching a movie.  I fell silent in my spirit. ""Why would I say that. I haven't been anywhere in the world. I am not one to make such a misinformed statement such as, My favorite place in ALL OF THE WORLD. How do I know that Africa, or England, Germany, Iceland for Christ sake wouldn't be more to my liking."" and in that thought, a voice deep within me silently announced itself with this......

It is your favorite place because you are there. Your favorite place in the whole world is where ever you are. Because where you are, God is. I must say that this statement was very powerful to me. It's alot to digest, I know that, and it has nothing to do with anything but just simply being happy because you are being. Because you live, Because God is everywhere.

175327,5,1401926339,"REVIEW UPDATED 06-02-12:

It is necessary to update this review because Amazon has merged the reviews for both the 1-disc release and the Deluxe, 2 disc-set. Adding to the confusion, this is the same DVD that was released under TWO titles. It is listed on Amazon in MULTIPLE locations because many are being sold used. This has resulted in a lot of consumer confusion and disappointment for those mistakenly buying it twice thinking it is two different movies. Amazon will of course refund the mistake (including return shipping) if shipped directly from them, but don't count on it from anyone else.

So be forewarned -- This review below refers to the 2-disc ""Deluxe Edition"" set under this title: ""The Shift"" (which is the EXACT SAME disc set as what used to be called the ""Expanded Version"" under the old title ""Ambition to Meaning""). Be sure to scroll up and check the PRODUCT DETAILS and look for ""Number of discs: 2"" if you want the 2 disc set. I initially posted two separate reviews: one for the single DVD and, one for the 2-disc set, but as I said, they merged the reviews in some places.

I hope this helps clarify things, but if there is still some confusion (and you probably won't be alone - lol!) plz feel free to ask any questions under the comments and I will respond as best I can. It really is a great DVD and probably worth all the trouble you might need to go through to ensure you are getting the product you really want. :)

I love you; Thank you; I'm sorry; Please forgive me. [Maybe a little Ho'oponopono blessing wouldn't hurt. ;-)]

************ ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ************

This review is based on the originally named ""Ambition to Meaning"" which I was told by Hayhouse is exactly the same as the renamed version ""The Shift"". When I called Hay House they couldn't remember why it was renamed but said these two DVD sets are indeed identical.

This is a two-DVD set: the first DVD is the ""movie"" (which is more of a docudrama) and is 2 hours long. The second DVD is a supplemental disc containing about 2+ hours of interviews, additional movie footage, and music. Both DVD's are excellent and worth a few dollars more for the set, as compared to the single DVD version that is also available. The second DVD contains the taped interview with Dr. Dyer that the movie was ultimately written around. It goes into depth into areas sometimes only touched on in the movie itself.

The movie follows the stories of various guests checking into a beautiful resort along the California Coast: a young family; a wealthy couple with a troubled marriage; and my favorite, an ambition-driven director, wonderfully played by Michael Deluise, whom I remember as a frequent guest star on the Gilmore Girls. (Some trivia here - he is also the son of Dom Deluise.) The director and his small crew are filming a docudrama starring Dr. Dyer (played as himself).

All of the key characters in the film experience what Dr. Dyer describes as a ""quantum moment"". It opens the door to transformation for them as they recognize and begin to live ""the music inside"" that Dr. Dyer teaches we were all born with but too often push aside while we are busy living our lives. One of the key points in the movie: what if we come to the end of our life and discover it was all wrong?

The three stories (as well as some additional, interesting character development) are expertly woven throughout the movie and accompanied by voice-over's from Dr. Dyer. His deep, soothing voice always seems to hit the mark and works perfectly within each scene that it is added to. (Not too much, not too little.) The dramatizations are used to illustrate Dr. Dyer's timely teaching (mostly Taoist) of transformation from a life of ambition into a more meaningful life; a life that can be just as successful and full of prosperity and ambition as you desire but with greater significance through a deeper, spiritual motivation. It is a wonderful departure from the usual ""live-audience seminar"" format of his previous DVD's.

The narrative and story lines used as a way to exemplify the ideas presented here remind me of another Hay House production also directed by Michael Goorijan ""You Can Heal Your life"" starring Louise Hay, and of another docudrama, not related to Hay House or Goorijan, ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" (I recommend the ""Quantum Edition"" only, as you can edit out the sometimes tasteless dramatizations & it offers hours of additional interviews). Although both of these are excellent DVD's and highly recommended, ""Ambition to Meaning/The Shift"" is so expertly written, directed, acted and produced that it has raised the bar and taken this genre to a whole new level. The cinematography of the Monterey Coast is absolutely breathtaking. The tranquil original musical score is worth noting as well. Especially nice are the original piano pieces played by ""Joe, the Janitor"" mid-way through the movie. (Don't ask... you just have to see the movie - it really does work.)

I have watched this DVD countless times now and continue to learn something new and unexpected about myself with each viewing. This is not a ""spiritual addiction"" response as a previous commenter on ""Ambition to Meaning' asserts of another reviewer who also said they have watched this movie repeatedly. But rather it is to be encouraged if you wish to explore your true purpose in life - or just want to make sense of life's struggles and challenges. You might learn something new with each viewing. Also worth pointing out is that I am a Christian and find these teachings well attuned to the teachings of Christ, so I hope Christians aren't threatened by Dr. Dyer's references to the Tao De Ching. I personally continue to grow and learn learn from Lao-tzu, Buddha, Krishna, Rumi, etc.... I believe, whatever your faith, you will find the movie inspiring if not life-altering.

""Seek and you shall find, knock and the door shall be opened to you"". God bless all who watch this DVD in the spirit it was intended. I believe you will be all the richer and wiser for it.

10-24-12 update: My husband and I just dug this movie out after a long hiatus and find it just as enjoyable and inspiring as the first time we watched it. No doubt this is destined to be a classic. I'd love to see more like this from Hay House. They recently released a set by the same director, Michael Goorjian,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-of-Everyday-Magic-The-Movies-4-DVD-s/dp/1401937748/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales of Everyday Magic: The Movies 4 DVD's</a>&nbsp;but they pale by comparison to this DVD and Goorjian's first Hay House release<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Can-Heal-Your-Life-the-movie-expanded-version/dp/B000Y04R96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Can Heal Your Life, the movie, expanded version</a>.

175328,2,1401926339,This movie does not compare to Wayne's regular DVD's. Has a sorry plot. Difficult to understand.

There's not any one thing I can say about why you shoud buy The Shift but this,"" It shows a much better way to look at your life, other people, and the world.

The format was the telling of many stories (Problems) and how they were resolved.  The character's stories were integrated skillfully with the information Dr. Dyer was imparting.  I have learned from every character and every bit of information.  I have watched the DVD over and over and am anxiously awaiting any other movies like this that are produced.
