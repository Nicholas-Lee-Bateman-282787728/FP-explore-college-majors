8720032,5,B00ZG3J2ZU,A great DVD for a true kettlebell beginner great instructor and love the home backyard setting feels like I'm right there exercising with them,1506124800,,142,4.958333333333333
8720033,3,B00ZG3J2ZU,"I have all of Lauren's other DVDs and I don't like this one as much as her earlier ones.  For someone who wants a quick workout, it will be useful, but otherwise I was somewhat disappointed.  Also, the location (which appears to be her back patio) is not as appealing as the locations in her other DVDs.  I feel there was a lot less planning in this production.",1463702400,2,361,4.279411764705882
8720034,3,B00ZG3J2ZU,"I like the workout,  however she died not have a warm up or cool down and she really does not break down  why and how you should use the kettlebell.  Also she should give recommendations on the weight to begin with.  I prefer Dasha Libin 's instructions better for beginners.",1457222400,3,275,4.44
8720035,4,B00ZG3J2ZU,"I like Shut Up & Train w/ KBells very much. I've done all 6 workouts in this series from a borrowed copy. I liked SUAT so much, I returned the borrowed copy and bought my own. Workouts are as Lauren says ""efficient"" as well as a time saver when you don't have much. The only reason I gave this 4 stars, is b/c there isn't a cool-down included which would make it even MORE convenient. Too bad I had to return it to Amazon for a refund b/c one of the 2 DVDs I received was scratched up.",1456012800,,485,3.9591836734693877
8720036,5,B00ZG3J2ZU,"I am ACSM PT-certified and bought this product on May 16, 2015 and since then, use it in my cycle of workouts constantly.
Whenever I feel a bit lazy, or otherwise lethargic, or even a little ""down in the dumps,"" I simply do one of the 6 different workouts found on the included 2 DVD set.
This perks me right up without the over-expense of time.

The format of each workout is 2 or 3 ""runs,"" each containing 2 to 3 different exercises in a row (with rests from 10 to 45sec in between).
Each run is then repeated one time before going to the next run.
Total Workout Lengths are 12'10"" to 17'10"" (to put a real fine point/being fastidious :) about it ).

Types of Kettlebell exercises found on these discs include:
Kick-Stand Dead Lifts; Regular Dead Lifts; Suitcase Dead Lifts; Goblet Squats; Front Squats; Reverse Lunges; Pushups; 2-Hand Swings; 1-Hand Swings; Alternating Swings; Cleans; Clean & Presses; (Just) Presses; Clean & Squats; 1 and 2 Hand Bentover Rows; Pullover to Crunches; Planks; Russian Twists; Overhead Sit Ups; Shoulder Taps...to name most of them.

The setting is nice: Lauren is very pretty and wears different outfits per different workout number to mix things up a bit (little side-point for us guys looking for a little workout motivation).  In addition, her husband Todd accompanies her in the near background throughout the workouts - my niece saw me working out with this product and was doting over Todd quite a bit; she said he is ""VERY CUTE!"" (so I guess there is a some motivation incorporated for you ladies as well :) ).

However, don't let the pleasantries fool you: Lauren is very technical and explains herself well, providing very high kettlebell instruction as she works out with you throughout this program!!",1453161600,7,1747,4.771523178807947
8720037,5,B00ZG3J2ZU,I have used Laruren Brook's The Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells Vol 1 and 3 and both are good BUT Shut Up and Train is awesome.  It has 6 workouts that are less than 15 minutes each.  Each one has an excellent combination of exercises.  These are very doable for the beginner.  If you are intermediate to advanced it is easy enough to combine two workouts for more challenge.  Love this workout DVD.  Definitely would recommend.,1440115200,11,451,4.717948717948718
