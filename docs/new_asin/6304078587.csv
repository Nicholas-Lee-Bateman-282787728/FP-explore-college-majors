7863146,3,6304078587,"""Ancient Secrets of the Bible"" is a series of videos that examines various people, places, and items from the Bible (the only exemption being the Shroud of Turin).  The videos are kind of like documentaries because of the interviews, illustrations, documents, etc. that are connected by a narrator.  However, about one-third to one-half of the tapes consists of dramatizations.  Some of these scenes add to the overall documentary feel, while some of the scenes seriously distract from the main purpose and make the tape seem more like a bad Sunday School presentation.  The videos do try to be fair in their approach by having interviews from both people who support the existence of the person, place or item being examined as well as interviews from people who deny the existence of the person, place, or item in question.  The videos also tend to rather ambiguously, leaving the viewer to decide for themselves rather it's fact or fiction.

In this episode of the series, the filmmakers examine the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel.  About half of the episode involves interviews and a look at other historical and archeological evidence and the other half of the tape consists of re-enactments.  According to the filmmakers, the Tower of Babel was built by the Biblical Nimrod.  This is an idea that many people believe, but the Bible doesn't say who built the Tower of Babel.  It just mentions the location of the structure.  It is true that the location, matches up with a list of territories the Bible says Nimrod was to have ruled, but other than that there is no indication that Nimrod was responsible for the building of the Tower of Babel.

TOWER OF BABEL--FACT OR FICTION isn't all that entertaining or informative.  There are some interesting scenes of archeological work going on in parts of Iraq, but this is about the most interesting piece in the tape.  There really isn't much information given and much of what is discussed is pure speculation (e.g. that Nimrod built the famous tower).  Some of the suggested re-enactments are entertaining, but many of them on the tape are cheesy and over-the-top.  The funniest thing on the tape happens toward the very end when an actor portraying Saddam Hussein is shown and the tape suggests that Saddam is planning to re-build or perhaps, has already begun re-building the Tower of Babel.

Overall, this tape isn't as interesting as other parts of the series.  There is a little factual information contained within and there is a small audience who might really enjoy this episode. However, because of the numerous speculations the episode contains, I cannot suggest it for anyone who is series about studying the Bible.",1162339200,6,2685,4.9157427937915745
