8044717,5,B00075JYA0,"I have only seen part of this beautiful, faith inspired DVD. The music, guitar and cello, is moving, the scenes that accompany the music are works of art! I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is moved by artists, who can convey passion, sensuality, and a sense of peace, through their instruments. A feast for the soul.",1104537600,4,330,4.610169491525424
