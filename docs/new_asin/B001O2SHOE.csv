8328937,5,B001O2SHOE,"Yes, if you can believe it. Great movie that takes a behind the scenes look at the people that compete in various eating contests - primarily the wing bowl in Philly.  The film makers connect you with the people, the culture and the frequent absurdity that surrounds an event that few of us can relate to.  You may find yourself looking at your dinner in a whole new light!",1233446400,,373,4.391304347826087

THey are so personable you cant help standing up and cheering for El WIngador as he wins the wingbowl over the Black widow. You go in to their homes and hear there wit as they build up to the day of their competitions. Visit with  wingador and humble bob. You'll never look at them or philadelphia the same!!!,1233446400,,392,4.444444444444445
