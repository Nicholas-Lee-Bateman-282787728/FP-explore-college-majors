8325412,5,B000MAYT50,"i used to watch this show in my dorm, every tuesday night. this was by far the funniest puppet stuff i have ever seen, the other stuff on college tv couldn't compare.  but, this would also be the funniest thing on most cable channels. each of the puppets is so different from one another it's insane to think it's one guy doing it all.  most puppet stuff is just so goofy or corny it's hard to watch but this stuff is like high-end artsy stand up comedy, like it's hard to explain but people who have seen the show know what i'm talking about.",1240099200,,543,4.211538461538462
8325413,5,B000MAYT50,"BOTTOM LINE: This show had more laugh-until-you-can't-breathe lines than any other show, pro or amateur.  You won't regret buying it.  Each episode is like a one-act play with a different main puppet character.  True, it's a one-camera student puppet show, but look the guy up.  He was an older guy who went on to do artsy puppet movies.  He seems about as un-student as you can get (if you believe, as I do, that nothing is worse than college students who think they can do comedy).  The funniest puppet show ever, and possibly the only truly funny college TV program ever, because there aren't any ""look how funny I am!"" moments.  In fact, the show seemed to gain more and more contempt for students with every episode.  Three cheers for that.

P.S. This DVD has all the original broadcasts, some of which aren't on YouTube.  No puppet appeared twice.  I didn't see this in any description, so I'll add it:
Episodes:
Skiddles
Prickle
Al (the Slug)
Reducey-Risk Reindeer
Barry Bible (very NSFW)
Dobo Disty

Bonus features:
Lil' Billy (my favorite)
Blinky Robot (done by someone else)
Skiddles short film ""Carpe Diem in Fur #2""
Interview short with the creator
<..> and a bit of other stuff I forget.

The back of the DVD case says they knew the station was doomed (likely from the Barry Bible episode), so they called their one and only DVD release ""Greatest Hits: Season 2"".  Like how Jeremy and Super Hans from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peep-Show/dp/B000A2UBOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peep Show</a>"" want to call their band ""Various Artists"" just to screw with everyone's music database.  Alas, no search result will ever yield you ""Live Hot Puppet Chat: Season One"", and those who aren't in on the joke will be forever adrift in their completeness desires.",1238976000,,1808,5.0608108108108105
