8164725,2,630103886X,"Fragments of many great speeches.  The only piece presented complete is a fairly trivial fireside chat.  Intercutting of enormous amounts of stock footage so that you can't study how Roosevelt spoke because there's always  something else on the screen.  The ""First Inaugural"" appears only  in fragments, scattered throughout the tape, with no identifiers; the  ""Date of Infamy"" speech, which is less than 8 minutes long uncut,  has been cut to less than 5.  It would have been a far better homage to FDR  to allow his words and presentation to be seen, rather than to jump in the  way with modern editing tricks, fragment the speeches into ""greatest  hits"" sound bites, and in general employ a visual style so noisy that  this looks like a badly done campaign commercial for FDR, not a collection  of speeches.  This tape appears to have been put together by a group of  filmmakers, schooled in sound bites, montage, and ""keep it  moving,"" but abysmally ignorant of history, rhetoric, or public  speaking.  Some clips are useful for classroom teaching or private study --  the fireside chat is a marvelous piece of epideictic speech on behalf of  religious tolerance.  But most speech clips here  are too brief to be any  use -- and many of the longer ones are marred by camera cuts to  meaningless-but-exciting stock footage, thus losing Roosevelt's  presentation.
