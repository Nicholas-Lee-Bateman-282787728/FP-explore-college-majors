8060478,5,B0009GYJDO,"I agree. I have been a fan of Jim Garner since the original days of ""Maverick"". I became an even bigger fan with ""The Rockford Files"". I had 36 hours of the series on VHS and then finally got all 6 seasons on DVD. I never tire of watching all the situations that Rockford gets into and out of. And all the while, hoping that he would end up getting paid. When the series ended, needless to say, I was disappointed. Later, when the Rockford Files T.V. movies came along, I was thrilled. So, I too, would love to find all thess T.V. movies. Anyone knowing where I might find them, either on DVD or VHS, let me know. The Rockford Files is still a great series and should not be forgotten. Some of our finest actors were in the series with James Garner.",1241654400,,749,4.208333333333333
