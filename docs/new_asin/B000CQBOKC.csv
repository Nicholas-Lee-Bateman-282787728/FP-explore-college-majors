8100355,5,B000CQBOKC,"This movie-documentary has a lot of information about rodeo, the action is great,it has lots of great rides, great runs, accidents, spills and thrills and it gives a more intimate glimpse of the life of rodeo cowboys of that era. Disney took great care to feature the great bucking bull Oscar who was on display live at the Pro rodeo Hall of Fame for a number of years, the blood line of about 90% of the great bucking bulls of the last 30 years can probably be traced back to Oscar. My question is: Why hasn't this classic jewel been released on DVD?",1289952000,9,551,4.359223300970874
8100356,5,B000CQBOKC,My father had been looking everywhere for this movie (except the internet) because he has no computer. He is so hard to shop for because he needs or wants nothing. The fact he actually had been searching for this and that I found it for him in two seconds made us both very excited. The movie was shipped right away and came in excellent condition. He has enjoyed it several times. I just went for a visit and finally got to see it myself. Great quality. thank you,1239148800,6,464,4.284090909090909
