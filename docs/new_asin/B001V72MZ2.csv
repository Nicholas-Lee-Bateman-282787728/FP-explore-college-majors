8345504,1,B001V72MZ2,"Another DIY 'film', shot on a budget of around 1000 dollars. Awful as it sounds. The 'Marines' are anything but. The plot goes nowhere. Some of the female actresses are actually decent. But nothing can help revive this zombie of a 'movie'.",1509667200,,239,4.714285714285714
8345505,2,B001V72MZ2,"This movie actually had a plot although parts of it were beyond my powers of comprehension. But if you stick with it and don't expect everything to be explained at the end there is a story there is a surprise in the final ten minutes. The only other things you will have to struggle through is the bad, and I mean bad, acting. So bad it is at times that it almost seems as if they characters are purposely stepping in an out of character and perhaps forgetting that they are supposed to be fighting zombies instead of petting puppies. Did I say zombies? Well most of them sport WWI-style gas masks and the ones who don't look like Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day. So they are not really scary. And finally, the weapons are some type of gun that shoots flashes of laser lights randomly here and there across the screen and the only way you can tell if it hits someone is that after a while they fall dead, although in the absence of any physical damage.",1486339200,,954,4.305555555555555

8345507,1,B001V72MZ2,"Platoon of the Dead (2009)
 I often wonder why some Zombie flicks get made and this is one of them.  Platoon of the Dead has John Bowker as the director, the producer and the script writer.  Bowker has directed other low budget flicks and had a hand in various way in several other movies.  He has worked on enough films in enough different jobs that we should consider him to have plenty of movie knowledge.  I am sure that he does.  He hired a couple of experience actors to work on Platoon of the Dead which shows some movie smarts.
 Tom Stedham plays one of the support roles, that of an army sergeant.  He has vast experience in the movies with over 40 film credits.  Arianna Albright, also in a supporting role, also has over 40 film and TV credits.  Why these two did not receive the starring roles I cannot fathom.  Instead, Chris Keown, an actor with only a single movie credit-this one-received the role of the army officer in charge and Michele Mahoney, an actress with a very slender resume, got the primary female spot.  Mahoney has some skill as an actress but Keown apparently just happened to be around when filming started.  Amanda Bounds never utters a word.  The other actors have no noticeable skills for this kind of work.
 The sound is good, better than many cheaply made Zombie films but nearly everything else is horrible.  They use toy guns for the main players, toy Star Wars guns in fact.  They look like toy Star Wars guns.  They shoot rays in pulses that look and sound like the blasters in Star Wars.  They even have a logo visible that denotes their Star Wars origin.  Enemy soldiers are armed with regular contemporary fire arms that also shoot pulsed raysfrom shotguns and AR-15s.  The private has a combat tunic with the emblem for a major on the collar.
 This is a Zombie film with some kind of a demonic connection which is never very well presented.  The Zombie attacks consist of poorly made up people rushing the living in an unconvincing manner followed by absurdly bad munching.  Sometimes stuff happens that isn't connected to the rest of the story in any way at all.
 But there must be some kind of a market for this dreck that makes it worthwhile for even people who know better to make it.  The same basic people who made this made another horror flick a few years later using Tyler David (the private who cant act), Amanda Bounds and Michelle Mahoney again.  In the new film Bowker wrote the script and co-producer, co-writer and second unit director Joe Sherlock from Platoon of the Dead directed.  The same people just mixed up a little in other words.  Im figuring that in order to have the will and the wherewithal to make film #2 they must have made some money on #1. But you do not have to watch this un-rated one hour and 22 minute one and a half brain Zombie flick.  I did it for you.",1423440000,2,2838,4.464980544747082
8345508,1,B001V72MZ2,"Another filmed in granny's backyard, Cellular-Phonavision, no actors required no plot desired movie. This movie should have received a Purple Heart!",1307404800,2,148,6.095238095238095
8345509,1,B001V72MZ2,"I love zombie flicks, and I watch them with no high expectations, so I bought the movie because I the plot was some what original if not interesting.  It was.........  It was interesting that I spent the first 20 minutes of the movie thinking it would get better. It took everything I had not to put my fist thru my TV, Three guys walking around in army clothes with a obvious toy gun that looked like they snuck on to a set of Star Wars and stole em.  There was no indication that they were in the future ( so I was confused with the guns), horrible acting, NO nudity and it looked like some zombie lovers decided to make a movie, went into the closet, got a camera and tripod.  To not only waste there time but waste whomever bought this dvd, in which case...........  Me.

Save you money, even if for whatever reason its on a movie channel, on demand or whatever don't waste your time",1284076800,7,887,4.25
