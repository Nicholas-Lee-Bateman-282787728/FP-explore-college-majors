3967808,5,B002QVBPC8,"Peru is a country rich in history and mystery, and as a native Peruvian, I have visited its many magnificent places. I cannot account for anything like the humbling sensation of experiencing the rock formations at Markawasi. One can easily spend time discovering them at different times of the day, different times of the year, and I would even venture to say at different moods throughout the year. They look different each time. Although there are plenty of beautiful pictures of this gift to humanity, I can honestly say that I was completely ecstatic to learn that a DVD features this magnificent place on earth. Kudos to all involved in making this documentary. Not only does it feature thought-provoking interviews and footage, but it delivers the beautiful sights in such an amazing way, with superb graphics that make me feel as though I was there again, absorbing the energy and being humbled by the mystery of Markawasi. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone!!!",1261785600,3,977,4.927272727272728
3967809,5,B002QVBPC8,"I thought it was fascinating and very well done. It makes me want to travel there. It is not an easy subject to document, as each person will obviously see it from a different perspective. How wonderful that so many mysterious places like this can now be viewed as an ""armchair traveler"". I know I will probably never get to actually Go there in person...but through this DVD and book, I feel as if I have had the privilege of a peek!",1259539200,,434,4.304878048780488
3967810,5,B002QVBPC8,"I had never heard of Markawasi before  a friend gave me a copy of this wonderful DVD. The adventure angle is breathtaking, the indigenous folklore riveting,  and the sights of the Andes are super! Who knew that such a place as Markawasi was still on this globe and waiting to be discovered by the mainstream. It is rare to find a new ancient mystery! The points of view of the people interviewed (which is one of the main themes of the movie) are thought provoking. The archaeology angle is fascinating but I particularly loved learning about Dr. Daniel Ruzo who seems to be an overlooked giant in Peruvian history. I highly recommend this movie to anyone but especially those who enjoy esoterica and archaeology. The monuments of Markawasi are  the most fascinating new things I have learned about in years. The experts who are shown in the film are very colorful and full of great information...Kudos to the film makers for making such a concise study of such a complex subject! The graphics are very well done too.",1259452800,9,1017,4.702247191011236
3967811,5,B002QVBPC8,"An excellent video for people with an interest in ancient contact between Africa and South America. The conclusions reached are startling, and the evidence is undeniable.
Giving credence to this theory is a recent scientific study from Svetlana Balabanova Germany that concluded a residue of coca (only grown in South America) was recently found in samples taken from a 4,000 year old Egyptian mummy raising the possibility that ancient Egyptians had contact with South America. If true, ancient Egyptians were trade partners with those cultures living in Columbia, Bolivia, and Peru. This film sheds new light on the growing controversy; view it with an open mind and the possibility that our history is much more extraordinary than currently taught.
Stunning visuals and thought provoking interviews. It stirs the soul.
Excellent job!",1259452800,,836,5.3893129770992365
3967812,5,B002QVBPC8,"I am a big consumer of non-fiction and am always searching for a new place to learn about on our fair planet. I was ABSOLUTELY THRILLED to find out about Markawasi , Peru in the wonderful documentary about its mysterious monuments. I loved the graphics and thought that Dr. Schock's opinions were fascinating. There are still many enigmas and mysteries that surround us and any one with a curiosity about such subjects will be enthralled to learn more about them in this documentary. The points of view of the subjects interviewed were different and intelligent. I could not get enough of the footage of the monuments themselves and saw in them the figures that were being discussed. The documentaty made me want to get on a plane and see and touch and smell the place in person!
Bravo to the film makers who took on such an esoteric subject and laid out the material (includng great historical footage) in such a clever, intelligent and interesting way!
ALL THUMBS UP AND FIVE STARS FROM ME!!!",1259452800,5,994,4.718390804597701
8377921,1,B002QVBPC8,Are you kidding me? All this is is a bunch of rocks. You may as well be staring at the clouds and calling out all the shapes that are in the clouds. Why would anybody take the time to make a video about a bunch of rocks on a plateau. It would have been different if they had been brought there. At least then there would be some argument for human interaction with these rocks. no these rocks were just part of the mountain that they were on. Everywhere else when people wanted to carve something into rock they transported the stone over great distances. This is just a bunch of rocks.,1486771200,,586,4.241071428571429
8377922,5,B002QVBPC8,Excellent program for anyone interested in ancient mysteries.,1484611200,2,61,6.75
8377923,4,B002QVBPC8,"I buy these kinds of movies it's what i like so i buy SYSFI and UFO movies in them they show the truth
of the world around us so if we see anything like it government has deniability",1399161600,,182,3.8157894736842106
8377924,5,B002QVBPC8,"I thought these were the best videos for a true realistic look at these formations.
The way it was made was very easy to understand.  You really got a good enhanced visual conception of what they are talking about and they go back a few times to each formation so you can see them in good comparison to the others.",1394236800,,314,4.233333333333333
8377925,5,B002QVBPC8,"I absolutely love this DVD, and it was so good that I bought another one for a friend.  She was mesmerized by it too.  Really makes you think and wonder about what else we as a modern culture don't know about our own Earth history.  The best word to describe this DVD is WOW.  If you like ancient history it's a 10+++++",1373760000,,319,4.096774193548387
8377926,4,B002QVBPC8,I viewed the program on TV.  I wanted to see it again. It offered interesting insights on a spiritual nature,1355529600,2,108,4.4
8377927,3,B002QVBPC8,"I found this documentary quite interesting but ultimately inconclusive. It is very much an opinion piece in that it includes commentary from several persons who all seem to have slightly different ideas as to the exact nature of the formations on the plateau. I was pleased to see Dr Robert Schoch included as the expedition geologist. His opinions seemed unbiased, but I was ultimately left wondering what he really thought. In some scenes I felt he was just being polite in humouring his companions who believe the formations to be man-made, while in other scenes he seemed in complete agreement with them.

I was left with the impression that Dr Schoch was in two minds about the formations and I don't know whether that is the actually case, or simply due to the way the piece has been edited. I was hoping Dr Schoch would be able to shed some light as to whether the formations are entirely natural, natural features that have been touched up, or entirely artificial. I would also like to have heard more of his opinion of the geology of the general area. Dr Schoch is famous for this opinions on weathering and erosion, and it would have been nice to know how old he thought any actual carving/sculpting might be. I was very impressed by his work on the weathering of the Giza plateau and Sphinx and hoped to hear a similar dissertation here.

The picture quality was not quite what I hoped it would be, so it is difficult to draw any conclusions based on the pictorial evidence presented. I was watching it on a large screen however, and it would no doubt be ok on a smaller screen. It seems to pre-date the current trend for widescreen formats as the picture aspect is 4:3.

Having said that, I would still recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the Markawasi (aka Marcahuasi) Plateau and in particular to anyone thinking of visiting the area in person. It does give you a good idea of what the region is like and what sort of preparations would be required to mount an expedition there yourself.",1335398400,,2008,4.603351955307263
8377928,4,B002QVBPC8,"This DVD fulfilled exactly what I was looking for. I wanted some great shots of these monuments so I could decide for myself whether they were natural formations or not. I still cant decide but they do offer some great shots and multiple angles for some of the ""sculptures"" for you to make your own judgment. The brilliance of Dr Robert Schoch is also featured in this video so you know your going to get a good educated, critical analysis of the site. If you are interested in Markawasi get this DVD, in fact I really don't know of any other documentaries that cover this site but I think more needs to be done on it.",1305936000,6,618,4.336206896551724
8377929,5,B002QVBPC8,"I had never heard about Markawasi until this DVD introduced it to me.  It is fascinating, and linking Egypt with the people who built Markawasi, and the indication that there are caves under Markwasi where the builders hid out during the great flood.  All of this ties up with so much other unrelated (or so I thought) stuff I had previously come across.  The four original tribes of the earth represented in the images!  The video was totally fascinating, the knowledge eye-opening.  The production quality is excellent, at the level of the best shows on Discovery/History Channel.  The overlay graphics used to hi-light the shapes was a brilliant technique  Besides the excellent production quality, the content and message was fantastic. Markawasi is a special place with a special energy that touches all who visit it.  If you are interested in ancient mysteries you can't miss this!",1274745600,4,887,5.027397260273973
8377930,5,B002QVBPC8,Great book.  Amazing monuments that can not possibly be natural.  There is clear evidence of design in the shaping of the rocks.  Worth a read if you are interested in an alternate archaelogical view point.,1265328000,3,206,4.828571428571428
