1722769,5,B0000687FU,"Following the successful run of ""SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU?"", ""THE NEW SCOOBY-DOO MOVIES"" was the first of many reincarnations of the lovable talking hound's show. To boost the already popularity of the series, each

episode of the ""THE NEW SCOOBY-DOO MOVIES"" featured a guest star -- ranging from celebrities like Sonny & Cher and Monkees frontman Davy Jones to characters from other Hanna-Barbera cartoons like Josie and the Pussycats and Speed Buggy.

  This video features the two episodes that guest-starred Batman and Robin.

  The episodes are:

  (1)THE CAPED CRUSADER CAPER

  Original Airdate: December 16, 1972.

  STORY:

  Scooby and the gang try to foil Joker and Penguin's attempts to steal a

flying suit from a goofy scientist.

  (2)THE DYNAMIC SCOOBY-DOO AFFAIR

  Original Airdate: September 16, 1972

  STORY:

  When the Mystery Machine breaks down, the gang bump into smugglers (loading crates into an airplane), Batman and Robin, a little old lady, and a punching clown filled with counterfeit money. A tip leads them to the abandoned carnival grounds...where they find the Joker and Penguin behind the kooky counterfeit caper. As is usually the case with these villainous villains, our heroes wind up in a funhouse hideout.

These two episodes actually live up to the scooby meets harlem globetrotters standard of excellent jokes that leads to many laughs though i do admit not a single episode can beat the hilarity of the globetrotters lochness monster episode. Watch the funhouse shenanigans, listen to the puns, and enjoy scooby's adventures with the caped crusader. P.S. What's the deal? Shaggy tells the gang about this cave he saw on their way to the campout area. Shaggy thinks the villains' hideout could be in there. They check it out. Fred says no one in their right mind would hide in there. Shaggy says i would. Then fred says like i said anyone in their right mind would not hide out here. Fred and the girls start to leave. Shaggy finds a secret passage in the cave that leads to their hiding place. Fred says come on guys follow me. Why doesn't he apologize to shaggy? Whatever.",1459814400,,1023,4.657458563535911

Compared to Superfriends and the Scooby Doo cartoons of the time this came out (1972), this is uncharacteristically BAD! Just awful. Very little plot, and Batman's neck is constantly exposed and in one frame he has no pants and in another frame he has no glove and is seemingly wearing Green Lantern's power ring. The Joker and Penguin are the villains of these 2 cartoons. I imagine this MIGHT appeal to anyone possibly under the age of 8. Just awful.",1389744000,3,625,4.589285714285714

Suffice it to say, after seeing the Batman cartoon from the 1990s (probably a bit too edgy for such a young child!), this Batman/Scooby Doo DVD was a bit tame.  Not a bad thing!  But he was expecting a bit more in the way of explosions, animation, etc.

I was relieved it was as tame as it is.  He still loves it and watches it with unabashed joy.

1723121,3,B0000687FU,"My kids love Scooby and Batman, so like most people, I agreed, it was a no brainer. I bought my copy in a store and didn't pay attention to the small print that said ONLY 1 EPISODE! There are 2 DVDs out there with identical boxes. The only difference is the writing that says contains 1 episode. I have no idea why they bothered to put this disk out. The other Scooby and Batman disk has 3 or 4 episodes. So pay attention when you're buying your disk.

That said, this is a classic and typical Scooby disk. It's the old style so you know it won't be too scary for the younger ones. My twin 4 years old and my 7 year old love the disk. If you like classic Scooby Doo, you won't be disappointed by this disk. I gave it only 3 stars simply for the 1 episode issue. I'll probably end up buying the full disk since my kids keep reminding me how silly I was to buy a disk with only 1 episode on it. Silly mommy.",1317427200,,905,3.9725274725274726

It combines the concepts of good vs. bad and teamwork with the lighthearted fun of Scooby-Doo.  My 3-yr old is really into Batman but had never seen a video becuase I just didn't think most of them were age-appropriate.  Found this and it is perfect.

1723163,5,B0000687FU,The idea of Batman being with Scooby just fascinated my daughter from the time she was 2. She would sit and watch that movie over and over. When she got a little older she would go play Scooby Doo meets Batman with her toys. We went through 4 videos of this movie. Now we have it on DVD. She's 7 now and it is still her absolute favorite movie of all times.,1187913600,9,357,3.9722222222222223
1723164,5,B0000687FU,"I remember this movie when it was shown on tv.  At the time I was probably no older than 10, now I have 2 younger brothers that like scooby-doo so I figured that they would like this.  I am pleased to say that they do.  Thanks again for making this classic available.",1184198400,,267,4.096153846153846

1723166,4,B0000687FU,"All in all, this is a nice little collection of cartoons for the kids. It combines two favorites- Batman- with Scooby Doo. My kids watched it from beginning to end, which allowed me to get a few things done around the house.

I recommend this one for the kids, and for that collector who wants all things Scooby.",1130025600,4,312,4.379310344827586
1723167,4,B0000687FU,"Alright. I admit that I do like Scooby Doo and Batman. So I am probably biased. Now ofcourse, this movie isn't for you if you don't like Scooby Doo or Batman. That said, this video/dvd is excellent! Granted, it's not so much a  movie. Rather, it is 2 stories that have a double episode length. The 1st story revolves around Scooby and the gang being in the wrong place at the wrong time while Joker and Penguin have kidnapped a scientist and want to steal one of his inventions. But ofcourse, Batman and Robin soon come on the seen. The best thing I can say about this is that Scooby and the gang DO NOT step over Batman and Robin. Rather, the story is well balanced so that they actually compliment each other. Joker and Penguin are ofcourse up to no good, but they carry a charm that makes them not only entertaining, but at times even likable. And the scientist adds some more laughs with his unusual speech. And with all the laughs, the suspense is there. Onto the second story. It is a little weaker than the first, but it still carries an acceptable amount of suspense and laughs. This 2nd story revolves around Batman and Robin trying to uncover a counterfeiting operation. The batmobile gets stolen, and Batman and Robin are lead to a funhouse where Joker and Penguin have some surprises waiting for them. Interestingly, the way Batman is portrayed in this video is not so far away from the way Adam West played him. My advice is that if you are a Scooby fan, a Batman fan, or a fan of both, this is an absolute MUST HAVE!",1113782400,16,1530,4.406360424028269
1723168,4,B0000687FU,"The ""Scooby Doo meets Batman"" DVD is campy fun featuring the two appearances made by Batman & Robin on The New Scooby Doo Movies (1972-1973).  In ""The Dynamic Scooby Doo Affair"", The gang teams up with Batman & Robin for a wacky showdown in the funhouse against the Joker & the Penguin. In ""The Caped Crusader Caper"", Batman & Robin join the gang to once again stop the crazy villainous duo Penguin & Joker, this time from attempting to steal a flying suit from the word fumbling Professor Flakey.  There are some cool extras like elapsed time footage of animators drawing both Scooby & Shaggy and interview clips of the original voice actors.  As cool as this DVD is though, you may want to instead invest in the upcoming 4 DVD set release ""The Best of the New Scooby Doo Movies"" featuring 15 out of the 24 that aired including both of these Batman & Robin episodes.  However, if you're only interested in the Batman & Robin appearances then this DVD is for you.

Goofs:

*There are always some animation slip ups in cartoons, but not always as hilarious as Batman with no pants!  Watch for it!

Trivia:

*""The New Scooby Doo Movies"" are double the length of an episode of the original ""Scooby Doo Where are You?"" show.  They were aired in an hour block.  On DVD they run around 40 minutes each.

*""The Best of the New Scooby Doo Movies"" 4 DVD box set features episodes with guests the Three Stooges, Jonathan Winters, Don Knotts, Laurel & Hardy, the Harlem Globetrotters, Don Adams, Speed Buggy, Mama Cass, and Dick Van Dyke.  Curiously, episodes with the Addams Family, Phyllis Diller, Sonny & Cher, Sandy Duncan, Davy Jones, Jerry Reed, Tim Conway, toon characters Josie & the Pussycats and Jeannie & Babu were not included. Instead the set chooses to have the multiple appearances by the Stooges (2), Batman & Robin (2), Knotts (2)  and the Globetrotters (3).

*Both Shaggy & Robin are voiced by radio personality Casey Kasem.

*The genius Don Messick who is of course Scooby also voiced Astro from the Jetsons, Droopy the dog, Boo Boo & Ranger Smith of Yogi fame, Dr. Quest & Bandit from Jonny Quest, Papa Smurf & Azrael from The Smurfs and that goofy dog Mutley from Wacky Races...just to name a few!
