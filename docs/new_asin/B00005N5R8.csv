7946294,5,B00005N5R8,My patient loves the worst witch and has the DVDs and some tapes I made for him when the show was on.  He will loves having these tapes and will watch them many times over.  giving for Christmas.,1382918400,,195,4.105263157894737
7946295,5,B00005N5R8,"An excellent series about Mildred a young witch starting at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches (a witch's secondary boarding school). It's based on the few 'Worst Witch' books by Jill Murphy (an easy good read as well) - which were rather an inspiration for Harry Potter, but lacks those book's home life and complete world view. There are three TV Worst Witch series (UK years 7, 8 and 9 at school - secondary school 11 to 13 years old) - so it's well suited to younger secondary and primary school girls (6+).

This DVD has the first six episodes taken from the first series (year 7), including the first one ever screened, and so is very good value. Note that in the US this UK/Canadian series was rather tastelessly dubbed in `American' but fortunately there is a `UK English' option in the DVD setup menu where you can hear the stars real voices [the choice is yours]. The rest of series one is on the 'Miss Cackles Birthday Surprise and sorcery and chips' NTSC two DVD set', also available from Amazon.

Annoyingly only series 1 is available in the UK. In the US though the complete series two is available, so look out for the two double DVD region 1 sets 'Up in the air' (yellow cover -Mildred + Hardbroom) and 'Old hats and new brooms' (blue cover Mildred + 4 witches), also available from Amazon (and with UK English options).

At 9 these DVD's were my daughters favourite viewing and she now has all the original books (now at 12 she has now moved onto Charmed and Bewitched). The Worst Witch isn't as scary as Harry Potter and all the cast are really excellent in their roles - Miss Hardbroom [Kate Duchene] even turned down a role in the Harry Potter film to remain true to her TV character. The special effects are actually quite good as well and even the 'Cackles Academy' theme tune very catchy.

Typical quotes: ""Magic must not be used for selfish or trivial ends!"" - Miss Cackle, ""Confidence and control, Mildred - that's the secret of success."" - Miss Hardbroom. So highly recommended for non-boy offspring - this series is easily a notch above the average TV sitcom or teen movie.",1168560000,,2099,4.559681697612732
7946296,5,B00005N5R8,"My six-year-old daughter has fallen in love with Mildred Hubble, who is the worst witch in this British series. It's about a girl who goes off to school to learn to be a witch. It's not easy and she has many misadventures, but she also makes good friends and actually turns out to be a very good witch. My daughter keeps asking me if she can go to witch school, too. The series is nicely produced. It's light and interesting -- perfect for girls from 6 to 10.",1163030400,,459,4.2272727272727275
7946297,4,B00005N5R8,"I can't resist mentioning something here.  For reasons known only to the folks at Bfs Entertainment, these six @ 25-minute episodes have been dubbed into 'American English.'  The dubbing performers are very ""broad"" in their handling of the material, so folks like E. Vasquez may be forgiven for thinking that Georgina Sherrington ""needs acting lessons.""  In fact all the ORIGINAL performances are fine (given the material!)  If you should happen to run across this DVD, do yourself a favor and switch from the ""English"" default setting to ""UK English"" (Set Up language #5) before playing the episodes.

I suppose this collection had to be split into two @ 75-minute discs, but it seems like a waste of disk space!  Of course they don't cost much in comparison to collections of 1-hour tv shows, but these six episodes are also far fewer than what would comprise a US tv season.

The episodes are cute variations on a Harry-Potter-esque theme, with awkward young tween-witch Mildred getting in continuous hot potion with strict and severe but relatively fair Miss Hardbroom (Kate Duchene).  Duchene, Clare Coulter, and Una Stubbs perform engaging variations on the Snape, Dumbledore, and McGonagall characters of the Harry Potter movies (it's hard to believe this series aired three years before ""Sorcerer's Stone."")  I'd recommend for pre-14 girls who like fantasy.",1151539200,6,1365,5.168181818181818
7946298,1,B00005N5R8,"Obviously Tracey Hogan, of Amazon.com.uk didn't see the original movie. While it's true that at first this collection may satisfy your hunger for more antics by Mildred Hubble....

This Mildred (Georgina Sherrington) needs acting lessons !!!!!!!!! They all do !!!!!!! If you've seen the original movie, like I have. This series is disappointing to say the least !!!!!!!!!

The girl that played Mildred Hubble (Fairuza Balk) in the original movie was perfect for this role. She's enchanting especially when she's clumsy. Her wit and charm will keep you spell bound. This movie leaves you wanting to know more and wondering what happens next year like Harry Potter you're intrigued to go on.

The girl in the TV Series, however, leaves a sour taste in your mouth. When I bought the first video, by mistake, thinking that it was the original movie, I could not wait to get rid of it. I did not want this eyesore to contaminate my collection.

Even my niece who was 7 at the time, hated this movie but loved the original. When she saw that there was a series on tape she made me buy the first one then cried when she saw it and wanted to break it.

If you want quality and to have a great time, get the original, The Worst Witch (The Movie) and get it on DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They made a real big mistake not casting the original actress to play Mildred Hubble maybe that's why it took so long to make.",1107907200,5,1399,4.531746031746032
7946299,5,B00005N5R8,I saw the original movie as a child and bought the dvd along with this series.  I'd never seen the HBO series but I read most of the books.  I wasn't sure what to expect but I loved it!  It filled out a lot of the gaps in the movie version and I love this new Ms. Hardbroom.  I've recently bought set 3 and 4 and I know I'll just love that too.  I'm impressed that the audio tracks are multi-lingual...I'll get a kick out of watching it in Spanish and German! It's a great family show and the chemistry among the cast is great....I almost wish I was a kid again and in Ms. Cackles Academy!,1100995200,10,589,4.0
7946300,5,B00005N5R8,"I love this adorable cable series. This isn't the Fairuza Balk film version. Stars Georgina Sherrington as the cute bumbling witch-in-training Mildred Hubble (Always in trouble!)Georgina is wonderful as Mildred, & Emma Brown as her ever loyal friend Maud Moonshine. Based on the books by Jill Murphy, which came out before Harry Potter (I might add).
Heart-warming, great cast & excellent acting. All of them embody the characters so well. There are a few new faces, Jadu Wali and Ruby Cherrytree as Mildreds friends.
 I also love the sets, very authentic. The castle is really brilliant, It makes me want to live there.
 Kate Duchene is wonderful as the dreaded Miss Hardbroom. I think she has great comic timing and really embodies, and perhaps brings even more to the part. She seems to enjoy the role too. And Una Stubbs is so endearing and charmingly quirky as the eccentric Miss Bat.
Felicity Jones is the PERFECT match for Ethel Hallow! She is absolutely mean. Poor Mildred runs afoul of her on her first day. I also like Holly Rivers as Ethel's sidekick and partner in crime, Drusilla Paddock.
I wanted to point out that if you play the dvd on number four (British English) in the audio section, you hear a lot more than the ""American English"" audio track. In episode 4 (A Mean Halloween) for example, when Mildred creates a voice changing potion, in the American English version you really can't hear much of a difference, but in the British English version her voice is REALLY high-pitched and squeaky (it's a lot funnier), plus I'm POSITIVE they've removed lines on the American audio track, because it was filmed originally British English. Anyways...
THIS IS A FANTASTIC SERIES! Much, MUCH better than the Fairuza Balk film version! It gives me warm fuzzies...:-)Goes great with cocoa. ;-)",1064275200,12,1802,4.88562091503268
7946301,5,B00005N5R8,"Both set one and set two of the Worst Witch DVDs are amazing!  Not only are the episodes delightful, but the quality is fabulous!  The author's words are truly magically spun into artistic splendor in these sets.  All ages will enjoy the mischief and life lessons illustrated here.
The Main character, Mildred, is always in trouble, but manages to mantain her values and kindness towards all living creatures.  She has a zest for battling the odds and coming through, even when she is prepared to truly give up.  All of us have a little Mildred in us, hopefully, and the power to act and move forth.  Bravo!",1012176000,6,607,4.626168224299065
