3561160,5,B001F12ITE,"The Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism DVD workout is a great mix of high intensity aerobics and muscle building strength training.  The 50 minute workout is both challenging and fun.

Trainer Tracy Steahle takes you through both level 1 and level 2 exercises.  She also instructs viewers on which muscles are being used in which exercises and encourages viewers to press on through some of the more challenging moves.

I liked the fact that Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism DVD workout did not require a lot of equipment to do the work out. All that was needed was a light set of weights, a heavy set of weights, a chair and a mat.  All of the exercises could be performed in a fairly small amount of space, although a large open space would probably be more enjoyable.

The chapters formatted on the DVD enable viewers to do only certain portions of the workout, or do the whole workout 50 minute workout in one session.

The additional Metabolism Boosting Meal Plan booklet packaged with the DVD includes a 7-day meal plan and 4 recipes. The 1400 calorie meal plans include 3 snacks and 3 meals each.

With the challenging workout and strength training moves, I can easily see how Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism DVD workout  will improve your fitness levels, build muscles and boost your metabolism.",1230595200,,1320,4.8053097345132745
3561161,5,B001F12ITE,"I really enjoyed this workout.  I need to add more cardio to my workout routine and I love to do toning workouts so this dvd gives me the best of both worlds!  I found it challenging and fun.  I had never done any workouts instructed by Tracey Staehle before, but she is very encouraging and friendly, which is great.  I loved that the moves were different and fun and hope that more routines are made in this series!",1227830400,4,417,4.3076923076923075
3561162,4,B001F12ITE,"I don't know why Amazon won't release this yet, when you can already buy it online elsewhere ... so that's what I did and I like this alot.
I already have another workout of Tracey's and that's why I decided to give this a go.  It's pretty good and definately more geared toward the intermediate to advanced exerciser.  It is interval training with good cardio and intense toning.  There are modifications if you find some moves too hard; she'll start with a base move that you can stay with, and then shows ways to add more intensity if you are feeling that way inclined.  All you really need are some dumbbells and you are good to go.  The dvd even comes with a little booklet about planning out healthy meals.
It's about 50 minutes all up and when you are done, you feel great.  You will feel this the next day or two and work up a big sweat.  I enjoyed it and will try and use this at least once a week or so along with all the other workouts I do.  This is fun and Tracey is a good instructor.  Give it a go.",1224547200,14,1013,4.127551020408164
3561163,5,B001F12ITE,"I bought this workout video because it was recommended by fitness magazine. It was worth every penny. The workout is just under an hour and perfect for any day of the week. My heart rate monitor likes this video a lot. I combines great cardio with strength. The host is kinda funny but it keeps you going through the whole thing. Plus, no tedious ab routines.",1265587200,,359,4.454545454545454
3561164,2,B001F12ITE,"My comments are designed to supplement the workout specifics delineated in the other reviews.

While I agree this would be difficult for a beginner, many of the other reviewers classify this workout as intermediate to advanced, I would not consider it advanced, unless one is using really heavy weights during the resistance training sections. Even the move modifications that Tracey says are level 2, are mostly not really that advanced for serious fitness enthusiasts who have been working out hard for a while (although several are). The cardio moves change frequently, are mostly on the lower impact size, and don't really go on long enough to really be considered high intensity, although you will get a sweat going. You'll do some jump moves, but not enough to consider this a plyometric workout. The resistance training segments have some original moves which is a plus, but most are standard. The level 2 resistance moves are compound moves, so if you are like me, that makes it much harder than single focused moves, and you'll have to lower your weight. I like to use noncompound moves to really focus hard on a single muscle group and feel the pump, this is of course, a personal preference.

Just be aware, with a full body workout like this, because you are doing resistance training on the full body (legs, back, shoulders [front delts, side delts), arms (biceps and triceps), etc., and are doing generally one set of high reps, and... compound moves tend to call for exercisers to lower their weights, this type of workout is not really designed to build muscle. You will build cardio endurance and build muscle endurance, but not strength or size.

Additionally, while I agreeing the cueing is good, I just find the trainer's voice annoying, and she talks NONSTOP throughout the workout. There is another workout in the same Results series, ""Ten Days to A Better Body"", which is similar in that it is a full body workout combining cardio and resistance training segments, but I like it much more. The trainer is Cindy Whitmarsh, and she has more original moves (and incorporates more core training in all moves.)

By the way, be careful when buying either DVD in this Results series, each of them have at least two covers (neither of which is of the actual trainer in the video), so don't accidentally buy the dvd twice!",1261785600,11,2336,4.8325
3561165,3,B001F12ITE,"I gave this to my wife to view and use to see if it was worth using.  Her thoughts were that is an adequate workout but that's it.  So many workout videos and dvds make strong promises about their product.  But in the end the majority are not worth the hype.  The only thing that makes this dvd special is the fact that everything is laid out in logical order.
But the bottom line is your looking at your standard workout video.",1258934400,,428,4.182926829268292
3561166,4,B001F12ITE,"The good news: if you follow the instructions in this DVD and meal plan to the letter, you're almost guaranteed to see dramatic results.

The realistic news: if you can follow these instructions to the letter, you're probably already in fantastic shape.

Tracey Staehle's instructions are clear and easy to follow.  She tells you what you should be doing, before you need to do it, and she explains the part of the body you're working and describes how it should feel.  She gives a one minute introduction explaining that you'll be doing aerobics and building muscle, and why that's important for boosting your metabolism.  There's a five minute warm-up, a 50 minute workout, and a 5 minute cool-down.  To see the promised results, you should do this workout 2-3 times a week, with a day or two in between to allow your muscles to recover.

That's a serious commitment of a big chunk of time.  I do work out more than that, but I found I got frustrated because I'm used to changing up my workouts, rather than doing an hour of the same workout.

And with injured knees, I'm unable to take full advantage of this workout.

I am still able to try a lot of the exercises here, though, because Staehle starts at ""Level 1"", easing into each exercise at a low level before pushing it to ""Level 2"", a high impact version of the same workout.  If you need to start slowly or stay at low impact, it's possible to stick with lighter weights (or no weights at all) and to repeat the Level 1 workouts instead of moving up to Level 2.

The included meal plan seems OK, though it won't be appropriate for everyone.  It's a one week plan, 1400 calories a day.  It does seem like a good, reasonable mix of protein, carbs and fat that is appropriate for a muscle-building workout, and it includes three meals plus an AM snack, a PM (before dinner) snack, and an evening snack.  If 1400 calories is right for you, and if you need the guidance of a meal plan to tell you everything you're allowed to eat (which can be a good training tool if you need to learn portion sizes,) and if you have the time to follow the plan and measure everything you eat, this looks like a good plan to follow.

If you've got that reunion or wedding coming up in a few months and you need to follow a very structured plan to shave off a couple of inches and tone up those sagging arms, I think this is a good way to go.  It's also a good starting point to learn how to structure a workout and build some muscle.  But it's going to take a serious commitment and a big block of time.  If you're up to it, go for it.",1250035200,,2574,4.313929313929314
3561167,5,B001F12ITE,"Great workout, end of story. I was pleasantly surprised by Tracey Staehle and enjoyed this challenge!  I wouldn't recommennd this for anyone with knee problems-squats are constant in this.

One exercise stood out for me in this, and it is nothing I've experienced in any other DVD...I've done quite a few.  Tracey combines a squat with an arm/shoulder move....wow.  That's all I can say.  Strength and cardio are alternated throughout.  The cardio was not too difficult, which was nice considering her intense strength moves.

I don't recommend this for beginner exercisers.  Also, at the beginning, after the warm up, the first strength segment - be sure to switch legs...I am not sure if she was off some with cueing or I just was oblivious because I was concentrating on the move.  Great workout!",1248134400,,799,4.947368421052632
3561168,5,B001F12ITE,"I purchased this product based on a different review site that thought highly of it, then after I'd already ordered it, read the reviews here on Amazon. I have to strongly disagree with the reviewers who state that it is not for a beginner. I would classify myself as perhaps an ""Adv. Beginner"" when it comes to working out and I found this workout to be VERY easy to stick with and didn't find myself wanting to quit at any point. Mixing the cardio and strength training really gives you a chance to catch your breath in between. Tracey breaks every exercise down into level 1, 2, & 3. Not once did I feel like I couldn't make it to the 3rd level. Therefore my conclusion is that if a dead beginner to working out tried this dvd, sticking with level 1 of all the exercises would not be hard for them. I do recommend watching it all the way through once before doing it because she moves from one thing to another without much warning or explanation, but once you get the hang of it you're fine. I did the workout for the first time this morning and afterward I really felt it in my butt and thighs (the two areas I feel need the most help on me!) so that made me happy! I don't think I'll be following the meal plan thats included but it has good suggestions and a few interesting recipes. So if you're a beginner, DON'T LET THE OTHER REVIEWS DISWAY YOU FROM BUYING THIS DVD! Start with level 1 and work your way up, don't get discouraged! I'll update my progress with this dvd in the comments as I go :)",1247011200,,1505,4.229166666666667

3561170,5,B001F12ITE,"Wow! I definitely get an effective, challenging workout with this DVD. I not only see results when I look in the mirror, but I feel them in my muscles as well. I don't often have the time to do an hour of uninterrupted workout, but I've found it very easy to divide this workout into two segments using the chapters feature on the DVD menu. I like Tracey Staehle as an instructor and find her to be knowledgeable and encouraging, which is important given the demands of this workout on my muscles. As with the 10 Days to a Better Body DVD, I find this an excellent workout that definitely works! I highly recommend it.",1244419200,,618,4.3826086956521735
3561171,5,B001F12ITE,I am in shock that anyone would complain about this workout.  It is one of the best workout DVD's that I have done.  She combines cardio with strength training.  It is an intermediate level and challanges me every time I do it.  I get bored easily but she is creative with her exercises.,1238630400,,287,4.3584905660377355
3561172,4,B001F12ITE,"This workout is a whole lot of fun! I am usually a FIRM devotee, but I will throw some other stuff in the mix and give it a try. Usually, I find that things aren't hard enough. I can't say that about this one.

Starts off with a regular warm up with step touches, hamstring curls, and knee raises. Goes into a nice, more thorough stretch than I usually get. First segment is weights, focusing on glutes and thighs. These are broken up into level 1: beginner, level 2: pumping it up to something more intermediate. She does that with all the remaining exercises. Next is sportsy cardio segment, followed by the toughest shoulder workout I have done in ages. Whew! She hits every angle of the bicep and triceps. More cardio, a fun standing sculpt segment,a floor sculpt segment, ending with a nice stretch.

What I liked: The instuctor was pleasant, had a clear strong voice and cued properly 90% of the time. The workout did make me sweat, my heartrate was where it needed to be, and I enjoyed ""the burn."" I really liked the level one, level two approach and challenging myself to shoot for the level 2.

What I didn't like: The instructor actually encouraged me to be ""off balance"" to work my core. Sometimes this was while leaning forward, balancing on one leg carrying heavy weights. I thought this was not the brightest thing! I kept my balance, and still kept my core in, even if I could ""feel the core kicking in"" if I was off balance-- I didn't want to risk it.

All in all, I thought it was a good, fun workout.",1238112000,,1518,4.410714285714286
3561173,5,B001F12ITE,Loved this workout.  I do alot of dance exercise dvd's and decided that I needed occasionally to add strength training.  Although the strength part is not terribly strenuous it uses many muscle groups then mixed with the cardio I get a good workout.  I like the instructor who gives simple clear directions and not alot of fanfare especially since she's alone.,1236211200,,360,4.868852459016393
3561174,3,B001F12ITE,"This is an Intermediate level work out. It focuses on increasing the muscle mass in your body, as that makes your body more efficient and helps you burn more calories during the day. It alternates strength training with cardio. It's a nice workout but since it is high impact it is hard on the knees.

This work out is geared more towards people who exercise regularly. It's not as fun as some workouts but effective. If you have joint issues, you may be better off with another program.",1235865600,,487,4.534090909090909
3561175,4,B001F12ITE,"I was breathing hard with this workout.  I wish there would have been recommendations for amount of weight to use in each exercise.  The instructor used the same weights for the whole workout but I definitely needed to switch it up.  On the whole I liked it, though.",1235865600,,266,4.5
3561176,3,B001F12ITE,"The moves are very fast and the instructions are not clear , when she moves from one step to another. So its easy to lose few steps.
This dvd could have been so much better had they slowed down a bit, given clear instructions. Its not completely bad, but could have been a 4 or 5 star dvd.
Its okay to have it for days where you need a different workout.",1235433600,,354,4.0
3561177,3,B001F12ITE,"I found this exercise video to be exceedingly difficult for my beginner level.  This seems more like an intermediate level.  Also, too many repetitive motions working the same muscle groups for far too long.  This also lends to the notion that this is meant for someone much more advanced.  I actually can't imagine myself performing this workout again, but because I can see some intermediate or advanced exercisers enjoying it, I am giving it 3 stars.",1235001600,,453,4.921052631578948
3561178,3,B001F12ITE,"I just delivered a baby and thought I could use this DVD to help myself loose some of the flabby.

More so tone my body.

Boost Your Metab is basically different techniques in exercising.

I must say I got bored within the first 20 minutes.

This could just be me..but I still kept at it hoping the music would pick up and be more fun.

I did like the fact that she emphasizes not just on cardio but also muscle sculpting and strength building.

But for me ...to keep doing it every day..It was not as much inviting or fun.

For serious exercise addict this must be fun as your already into it.

But for someone who just started, I think i need more than just this.

I like the fact that there are smart diet tips to keep off the excess calories.

Else..Its a little too boring for  my liking.",1235001600,,793,4.185430463576159
3561179,5,B001F12ITE,"I have a lot of fun with this DVD. It is a challenge in the beginning, but after a couple weeks everything will get better. You just have to remember to keep pushing yourself. I've been doing this workout every other day and I can feel I'm not as tired durning the day and have more energy. I actually look forward to working out now! I've been doing this for about 3-4 weeks and I workout 5 days a week, alternating this DVD with the ""10 days to a better body"" workout. I like the meal plan included with the DVD and I love how they give you variations/substitutions for each snack and meal idea in the back on the booklet.",1235001600,,624,4.1652892561983474
3561180,5,B001F12ITE,"I got this along with ""10 Days for a better body"" for my wife who gave birth recently.

Unlike the other DVD which can be ""adapted"" for our needs, we feel that this is more for an intermediate/advanced level. It is definetely easier for someone who excercises regularly. In total the exercise package is around 50 minutes long. It is broken into parts like: warm-up, tonic and aerobic, additional toning and cooldown.

The exercises are a combination of aerobic and weight excerices. For the beginning I would recommend 3 or 5 lbs as the starting weights. I find the combination weights/aerobic to be well balanced.

While not for the ""out-of-shape"" this DVD is a steal at this price.",1233532800,,684,4.779661016949152
3561181,3,B001F12ITE,"You will need a mat and weights a light set like 3 or 5 pound weights and a heavierr set like 8 or 10 pound.

The video can be broken down into small segments, warm up, upper body wieghts, cardio what have you.  I did the whole set it's about 55 minutes or so.  The instructor gives you an intro on how to boost your metabolism, she was a little over expressive, translation, annoying.  The cardio segments build nicely so you donn't get to confused if your bad with directions as I am.

The weight segments are interpsersed with the cardio bits (aerobic type routines).  So about 6 or so minutes of cardio and then about 6 or so minutes of weights.  The moves are not overly complicated or intense, I think it's the combo of the cardio and moving without stop into weights that is supposed to boost your metabolism.

The video is Okay.  You get out what you put into the workout.

There is a 1400 calorie meal plan with some instructor and nutritionist tips in the booklet inserted in the DVD.  There are also four recipes in the booklet.  The video is geared for women but the booklet does mention that for men they should increase the calories by 300.",1233446400,,1154,4.366197183098592
3561182,5,B001F12ITE,"I was surprised at how much I like this workout. I'm not a fan of Staehle, but this well-cued workout is nicely advanced at the level of Kelly Coffey or Cathe Friedrich. It is chaptered into cardio and weights and each section is long enough to make a difference (about 10 minutes alternating). Unlike '10 Days to a Better Body', this one allows you to do just weights or just cardio if you wish, or switch the order. It includes lots of balancing and compound moves. It also allows you to go heavy with the weights. The pace is just right and the music is pretty good as well. It is not at all the same as the other Results workout (with Cindy Whitmarsh). I really find the negative reviews here ignorant. If you're torn between the two DVDs, this one is the better one.",1232668800,7,771,4.324137931034483
3561183,4,B001F12ITE,"I bought this DVD after reading about it in a magazine. I have to say that I am not disappointed. The cardio portions of this DVD are very effective and are easy to learn. The strength training portions are perhaps the weaker part of the DVD. While I believe interval training is very effective and I believe that the strength training portions of the DVD blend very well with the cardio, I do believe that all need at least two days of intense strength training and for that I recommend Jari Love's ""Ripped & Chiseled"". As many others have stated this workout is definitely not for beginners. (A good one for beginners is Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Away the Pounds"" One or Two Mile Work Out.) It is geared towards the intermediate and the advanced person.",1232496000,,752,4.5777777777777775
3561184,4,B001F12ITE,"I am currently active and do a routine that incorporates pilates, yoga, cardio, and weight training.  Even still, I found this workout to be challenging and did a great job of working me into a sweat.  As others have said, it may not be the most fun workout but it is still quite effective.  However I will say there was enough variety in the exercises that it kept me from getting bored or losing my motivation.  As with any workout if you do it repetitively it does get boring.  However, it adds great variety of my routine and helps keep me motivated as I find the trainer approachable and inspiring without being chirpy or annoying.

I especially appreciate that there are enough variation in the exercise to meet your level of fitness.  This makes the video one you can grow with over time even as your endurance increases and you become more in shape.  The only thing I am less convinced of is how much this body actually boosts your metabolism.  It is true that strength training helps, but without hard scientific facts I am not convinced it will be significant with  the way this workout is designed.  However I would love to be proven wrong as the more I can boost my metabolism the better.

Overall this is a solid workout.  Will it compare to a class in the gym or a session with the trainer? Probably not.  However it is still a great home workout that is challenging and will certainly leave you sore and sweaty.",1232496000,,1426,4.476744186046512

I like the instructor -- she is not irritating like *some* DVD instructors become over time.  I like the way she alternates cardio and toning and really works up a nice sweat.  Some new and interesting moves to mix it up a bit.  I really felt it the first few times I used this.
This was like a great hour long gym class, very encouraging and friendly.  I have added this DVD into my usual workout cycle along with all my FIRM DVDs.

I did not try her meal plan because I already have my own diet that works for me, but I read over it and it looks pretty good.

It starts with a warm-up.  Then back work with weights.  There are cardio intervals.  Very athletic.  I think the weight and cardio intervals are a bit too long.

The exercise take up a bit more space than I have.  The music is a bit masculine for me.

""10 Days to a Better Body"", by the same makers, is great.  There are one-minute intervals, and the music is pleasant.  It takes less room, and the workouts are 1/2 hours, 2 of them, once every other day. It is very challenging as well, but at least it is 1/2 hour!

The diet that comes with this DVD is just as predicted; expensive shopping trips, and not a good use of leftovers.  All except you have to cook recipes, and use those leftovers.  That part is good if you like to cook.  I just do not have time.

A lot of lunges, free-weights.  All parts of the body are worked.  Not in sections like the other DVD I mentioned.

I see nothing new.  There are dance steps that frankly, I am not willing to do.  Some people need a challenge, and that is ok.

THERE ARE NOT A LOT, JUST A FEW RECIPES but they are a starting point for many.

I'm in my mid 30's, still lugging around some extra 30lbs that has become mine since my daughter's birth... I have great exercise intentions but am still slacking, this video sounded like a good one to boost my metabolism and hopefully my enthusiasm for exercising.

I've given it a 3 because while I feel it's a good video, it's not for a beginner and instead of boosting me its almost made me want to give up (I won't, I'll just shelve it until I'm in better shape) as it's pretty tough, I started with my 3lb weights but quickly had to switch to 1lb... often she'd say ""just a couple more"" and I'd think, for me to watch not do I'm beat!

There is a good variety of exercises on the video and it's pretty long so I feel like once I'm up to the challenge it'll give me a really good workout, I'd also recommend newer exercisers to start out slow and don't overly push yourself since you'll just end up overly sore and frustrated.

I liked the way it is broken into 10 sections, but I have a history of back problems, and while I was working out to this DVD, I could actually feel my back pulling, and I had to stop. I did use the weights, but I had to modify it to my level of exertion. I basically stayed on level 1, even though she encourages you to try level 2. If anyone has back or knee problems, approach this workout with caution.

This workout video also includes a booklet for a metabolism boosting meal plan which is based on a 1400 calorie daily intake. I found it to be higher in protein.

A new workout from NASM certified trainer Tracey Staehle designed to boost metabolism by working core muscles and building endurance.

As mentioned, this is not a beginner's workout DVD, however, it's a great adjunct to your fitness program, especially when an hour at the gym isn't possible.  All that's required is a little space, a mat, hand weights ranging from 3 to 10 pounds (I recommend both three and ten pound weights) and a chair.

This is a one-on-one workout--almost like having your own personal trainer.  The routine is divided into different activity level segments--a 5 minute warm-up, then a half hour of aerobic and toning (using weights), another 12 minutes of toning and a four-minute cool-down.  Each segment has at least two levels and you can modify--or skip--the second level if you need a less strenuous workout.

Tracey combines moves so that more than one area is worked together, for example, upper and lower body moves as in the lunge where you're also working back and shoulders.

I'm a certified water fitness trainer and I found myself working hard at the halfway point, evidence that this is a challenging workout for anyone not in shape.  For maximum results, an eating plan is included.  I'd suggest you try it or something similar.

I would recommend this workout with one caveat: little to no instruction for modifying exercises to compensate for knee or hip issues is addressed, so you need to use a little discretion on how vigorously you attempt each routine.",1231804800,4,1692,5.494208494208494
3561191,4,B001F12ITE,"As someone who wanted to get into better shape without paying for a gym membership where everyone looks at you if you are not in perfect shape I thought this would be a great workout.  Please note that I am a beginner at working out.  Talking newbie all the way.

The DVD is broken into 10 segments.  These are easy to search for on the menu if you want to go back to one or go forward.  Each segment has a Level 1 and Level 2 depending upon how much you can endure.  Needless to say, I struggled with Level 1 workouts and only made it through the first 5 segments before my body was screaming at me to stop.

It does recommend that you have a pair of 3 lb and 10 lb weights.  Also you need a mat and a chair.  You wouldn't need a mat if you have carpeting where you are doing your workout.  Any kitchen chair will work.

When I first read the meal plan book included it made me want to forget about any type of meal plan and go eat some brownies.  The 4 recipes included were 3 chicken meals and one protein smoothie.  I made the Pepper & Chicken Stir-Fry and found it to be quite good.  The protein smoothie however wasn't liked by anyone here, but maybe that is just us.  I really think it was the protein powder that we used that made it not taste good.

Beginners - NO (get something less demanding to start with)

The workout is broken down into several sections, and the user can break it down and sequence it to match available time and choice of body parts.

The exercises are demonstrated quickly, and only shown at one level.  Modifications and accommodations are not shown or explained.  Many moves involve jumping up and down or side to side.  Weights are used, but the instructor does not discuss how to use them safely.  The transitions between exercises are quick.

If you are experienced at working out, this is a good DVD.  It's good to have for those times when you cannot get to the health club.  If you are not already in good condition, do not get this DVD.  This is not a beginner workout.",1231372800,4,966,4.359550561797753

Also, I have to agree with another reviewer who noted that proper form is not clearly demonstrated, especially for weights and cardio. I think that makes it much too easy to get hurt. It would have also been helpful to have another person with her demonstrating level one, while she did level two. It's a good workout, but wasn't fun for me because I worried about injury and it wasn't easy to follow in certain portions. I would not recommend buying this video.",1231113600,4,754,4.471014492753623
3561198,4,B001F12ITE,"Tracey Staehle is one of my favorite instructors, so I was eager to try this new workout of hers.  As a bit of background, I consider myself to be a high intermediate/advanced exerciser, and own about 120+ workout DVD's, including about five or six of Tracey's independent workouts.

This workout is set up as a circuit so that you burn more calories by using your larger muscle groups.  It runs about 51 minutes long, and is broken up in alternating segments: a weight segment, followed by a cardio segment, which is then repeated. After a six-minute comprehensive warm-up, for instance,Tracey moves into the first weight segment (which is composed of back and leg exercises), before setting down the weights and moving into a short cardio segment that lasts about five minutes.  During each segment, she also kicks things up to what she calls Level 2, so you really go all-out.

She cycles through each of the major muscle groups in a similar fashion, each time incorporating some leg work (such as lunges or squats) to help bring the calorie burn up.  By the time you finish this workout, you'll have worked all of the major muscle groups, although she did seem to spend more time on back and shoulders than on chest, biceps, and triceps.  By the time I finished this workout, I felt like I had worked everything and had a nice burn going.

Some pro's:

1.  Tracey is her usual cheery self in this workout; she is a sweetheart and her personality makes it a pleasure to work out with her.
2.  She gives excellent form pointers throughout the workout, such as her reminders to ""reset your posture"" before starting a new weight exercise.
3.  You only need two pairs of dumbbells (I actually used three pairs of 3's, 5's, and 8's) and a chair to do the workout.  (The chair is used for a segment that focuses on legs, and you will really feel the burn.  If you have Cathe F's Kick Max workout, the chair segment in this workout is similar to the one in Cathe's workout, although it is not as long.)
4.  You can easily modify the moves to make the workout easier or harder.  I have a bad knee, so I couldn't do all the squats, lunges, and plie squats that she does, but I was able to modify those moves, along with the moves from the cardio sections.
5.  There is a nice warm-up and a nice cool down in this workout.  Sometimes shorter workouts tend to skimp these sections, but this workout doesn't do so.
6.  The booklet that comes with the DVD has a seven-day meal plan that looks fairly good, along with a couple of recipes.

Some con's:

1. The music on this workout is just so-so.  It's not the worst, but it's rather generic and average-sounding, and so not very motivating.
2.  As mentioned, Tracey gives great form pointers, but the incessant chatter was a bit too much in places, esp. if you already know how to do these moves.  Even if you don't, after doing this workout a few times, the chatter may start to bother you.
3.  There is no separate core segment in this workout.  Some of the exercises definitely work the core, but, in a full-body workout like this one, I would have preferred an actual core segment.

Overall, this is a fun, solid workout, and I definitely recommend it!",1231113600,3,3196,4.503472222222222
3561199,5,B001F12ITE,"Okay, I feel that I must clarify and validate the following review as I did not personally get this DVD for myself, but for my girlfriend. Therefore, this review is based upon her experiences with this product, and not my own. With that noted, here is her review.

When you get this DVD, the very first thing you should do is sit down and watch it a couple of times first before you actually try and following along with the exercises. At first I tried to just jump in with the DVD and it just didn't work for me. So I sat down and watched the DVD twice, in a row, and then on the third time I followed along with the exercises and had a much easier time with it.

I have to admit that at first I thought this was an aerobic DVD, but soon found out that it was anything but. As a matter of fact, I actually had fun doing the exercises, although admittedly I was pretty sore two days after doing it the first time. Now that I have been doing these exercises three times per week for the past three weeks, I am nowhere near as sore as I was, and I am actually feeling better and I have even lost a little weight and I really hope that I don't find it again. Now I haven't really been following the diet program ""Metabolism Boosting Meal Plan"" that was included with this DVD. Although it does seem like it is a good one, I just have better luck with an entirely different diet.

I have actually made better progress going to the gym and actually lifting weights and utilizing the various weight machines. However, having said that, I have actually done better at the gym since I incorporated this workout on the days I don't go to the gym. So I would have to say that this DVD has been a definite plus to my workouts and overall health and I am really looking forward to seeing even better results as the weeks turn into months.

3561200,4,B001F12ITE,"I am a daily exerciser who does a range of workouts, from taebo, kickboxing, yoga, salsa, step etc.  I guess you could say that I have a boredom problem, so keeping it fresh with many workouts to choose from is important to me.  As I get older I also look to add in resistance training to keep my bones healthy, which is really important at any age.  I found the workout to be challenging (in a good way).  The workout is 52 minutes long and led by Tracey Staehle, who is a certified trainer with both the AFAA (Aerobic & Fitness Association of America) & NASM (National Academy of Sports Medicine).  She also carries a Master's Degree in nutrition.

The workout is 52 minutes long and consists of 5 minutes of warm-up, 31 minutes of Aerobic & Toning with Weights, that alternates, 12 minutes of additional toning and 4 minutes of cool down.  You will use a lighter set of weights for some of the exercises (3 lb is what I used) and heavier set (I used 5 to start, but realized 4 was already kicking my butt, so I'll work up to heavier).  As you get stronger, you have the option to up your weights for a challenge when you become accustomed to it.

The routines start with an easier exercise and then you progress to a more challenging variation, which usually includes deeper squats, more body parts being active in the exercise, or in the aerobic segments, more jumping.

I would caution, that this is a higher impact routine in the aerobic section and you will be doing some jumps, which rev up the metabolism and heart-rate, but may not be especially kind to those that have any knee issues.

The routine is a one-on-one, and it is a straight up workout-Tracey is excellent on the cuing, has great form and keeps the workout at a good pace (I especially like when she tells me only a couple more to go!).

All and all a good work-out.  Is it fun?  Well, I do have ones that I enjoy more, but for a sheer kick-butt workout that had me in a sweat, I'd say this one was the ticket. Oh, as a bonus....there is a booklet for meal planning to boost the metabolism as well.  I have not tried this, as I am happy with my diet at this point, but looked through it and the meals and recipes noted were definitely things that could assist you.  As someone who has lost over 45 lbs and kept it off for 4 years I can tell you the best eating program is the one you will stick with, so if this does it for you, great.  If not, or you just use the work out and some of the good ideas, you are well on your way!",1230854400,33,2500,4.2075471698113205
3561201,4,B001F12ITE,"I decided to kick off the New Year by trying Tracey Staehle's ""Boost Your Metabolism"" workout.  It was easy to follow but yet challenging enough that I felt it in my legs by the time I finished.

This is an interval workout combining five weight-training segments with three cardio segments.  The first weight segment works the back and legs; the second one, the shoulders and legs again.  Biceps and triceps are covered on the third segment. The fourth one focuses on the legs and the last one on the chest, glutes and hamstrings.  In addition to your dumbbells, you're going to need a chair for the fourth segment and a mat for the fifth one.
The cardio segments were just long enough for me (between 5 to 7 minutes) to get my heart pumping, but thankfully short enough that I did not feel tired nor was I out of breath.  The moves are not complicated.  Though you don't need a large space to do the cardio, make sure that you have enough legroom for both front and back kicks.

Thorough the workout Staehle demonstrates two levels of difficulty.  Level one is for beginners and a more challenging Level 2 for those with more stamina and flexibility. Level 2 usually involves doing deeper lunges, lots of squats, jumps and leg balances.  Since I have sensitive knees, I found myself keeping the lower part of my body on Level 1 while my upper body followed Level 2 movements.  Staehle works out alone, and she effectively guides you by emphasizing proper form, cuing you to the next movement and by encouraging you to try the next level or to go at your own pace if it is too much.

I recommend this fitness DVD to both beginners and intermediate exercisers.  I like the fact that it helps to tone different muscle groups at the same time with straightforward moves.  ""Boost Your Metabolism"" is definitely a keeper for me.",1230768000,,1824,4.572307692307692
3561202,4,B001F12ITE,"Notice: this is NOT an aerobic exercise program.  The theme of this dvd is to work on your core muscles of your whole body.

It is 55 minute workout broken out into five key weight segments and three cardio segments:

Weight segment 1: back and legs
cardio 1
Weight segment 2: shoulders and legs
cardio 2
Weight segment 3: biceps and triceps
Cardio 3
WS 4: leg balance
WS 5: chest, glutes and hamstring
cool down

when you are in the cardio and weight segments there are two levels: level 1 and level 2 => different level of difficulties, which the instructor explains one after the other.  This is the bit that I wish they had another person or a inset to explain, because as a more intermediate exerciser, I had to follow/wait for level 2 before I could really partake and often I wished for some of the weights pieces that the repetition was for at least 10 instead of instructions for 5 at level 1 and 5 at level 2.  Although once you have gone through the dvd a few times, you can either do level 1 or 2.

it seems deceiving in the first 10 minutes of the exercise whether you are getting anything out of it (intermediate speaking), but believe me once I hit the 30 minutes, I was feeling the muscle burn.  I have tried this dvd twice on alternate dates without overworking my muscle groups.

So this dvd is great at home workout with minimum equipment (one set of large, one set of smaller dumb bells, mat and a chair) required, some space to move and jump for the cardio segments.  I like the fact that both beginners and intermediates could use it.

8300622,3,B001F12ITE,"I have a friend over twice a week to do DVD workouts in my livingroom.  This week, we tried Boost Your Metabolism, which is a sequence of alternating strength and cardio segments and also includes a warmup and cooldown.

Before I continue with my review, I find that it helps readers to know what my age and fitness level are so they can tell whether they may have a similar experience with the DVD.  I am in my late 50s and my friend is in her late 60s.  I walk daily and have gone to the gym 2-3 times a week for the past year.  She walks regularly and has gone to the gym 1-2 times a week for the past year.  I am overweight by about 60 pounds; she has maintained a weight loss for years.  We both have bad knees, so anything high impact is a problem for us.

After the workout, I asked my friend what rating she would give it if she was doing the review.  She said 3 stars and that's what I was thinking as well.  Here are some issues with the workout from our perspective.

1. Too high impact/knee punishing: Lots of jumping up in the air and very deep lunges.  We know our limits so we just did our own moves during the jumping portions and did a modified lunge vs. the very deep lunge.

2. Instructor issues:  The instructor is cheerful and has a good sense of humor, but while she may TELL you what's coming next verbally, she doesn't SHOW you, and often she doesn't tell you what direction you're going or on which leg to start.  This caused confusion and frustration for both of us.  Granted, it was our first time doing the DVD, but I have done scores of DVD workouts in the past 7 years and I have not found most of them this confusing to follow at the start.

3. Weight level:  As an FYI, you'll want to start with a lighter set of weights than you usually use for your upper body workout when you do this DVD.  I usually use 5s at home for most DVD workouts and 8s, 10s or 12s at the gym and I know I couldn't have gotten through the weight portions of this workout with any of those.  Both my friend and I used a set of 2 pounders and even that was a struggle at times because of the repetition and pulses, and because you're always working lower body at the same time, so it is a more intense workout than just standing still and doing bicep curls.

4. Cardio level: Both of us definitely felt this workout while we were doing it and we were both sweating by the 2nd cardio segment but, interestingly, I'm not feeling it much at all today (the day after) and I expected that I would.

5. Not for beginners or those who have poor balance or coordination:  My friend and I agreed that we would not recommend this workout to people who are just starting a workout regime.  While I am quite coordinated and usually pick up dance and workout moves quite easily, my friend says she is not as coordinated and has always struggled with workouts that have both upper and lower body going at the same time.  So if *I* was frustrated with the complexity and lack of adequate queueing in this workout, you can imagine how SHE felt.  I could tell she was exasperated.

6. There IS a cooldown segment, I felt that it was inadequate for the intensity and breadth of the workout.

In summary, if you are at a moderate or advanced level with aerobics/cardio and are in good health, you may quite enjoy this workout, but I do not recommend it if you are a beginner or have issues with your knees/hips or high impact workouts.",1271980800,9,3423,4.216589861751152
