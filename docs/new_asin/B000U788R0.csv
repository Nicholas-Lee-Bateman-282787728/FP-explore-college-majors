8212304,1,B000U788R0,This was the worst!!! video. There was a narrator and the warm up was almost the whole video! I would never recommend this!!,1412812800,,124,4.434782608695652
8212305,5,B000U788R0,"This video is one of the best workouts I have done with a boxing/kickboxing aspect that is not Tae Bo.
It starts with a great warm-up series, many of which I had never seen done
in this way before, followed by a half-hour pretty intense calisthenics routine
utilizing boxing and kickboxing techniques, interspersed with bouts of strength exercises.
Done back-to-back, the workout is great for toning, and getting the heart rate up, as well
as improving flexibility.  I wish there were more titles available from this guy, but this one
DVD I think will serve me well for a long time to come because it can be done all the way through,
in whatever time increments you have available, or combined with the boot camp routine for
a serious butt-kicking.
It is also followed by a cool-down and stretch series.
Great find!",1344902400,2,815,4.73943661971831
