8371859,5,B002KBCA0A,"How many documentaries have I seen about Sept 11? I can't even count them. I am a US History teacher, and beyond my own search for meaning and understanding of that day, I seek the best avenue to present this to students in a way that stands out. There are many good documentaries that trace the chronology of the events of that terrible day, but this one catches the emotion, the heart-stopping helplessness we all felt, and the astonishing acts of bravery, unity and compassion demonstrated in NYC that day.

A single, still photo has the power to capture a moment in a way that video and film do not. It is a moment frozen in time, an interruption in the flow. It gives us the time to stop and really look.
On Sept 11 2001, there was a huge convention of international photojournalists in Manhattan. This documentary is comprised of hundreds of pictures taken that day, with the photographers explaining how they came to take that particular picture, and how they felt when they captured that moment. Some photos are heartbreakingly familiar, others are unexpectedly chilling--- and others are moments of profound humanity. Each photo speaks to the grief, the horror and the incredible spirit and courage found on the ground in Manhattan that day. In the streets, in the stairwells, on the boats, in the firehouses, that spirit shows through with quiet strength.

It was made a year after the attacks, and twelve years later, it still has the power to bring tears to my eyes. My students were in kindergarten that day, and they barely remember it. But this video, this simple collection of photos leaves them stunned.

 I recommend this highly. Not one of the dozens of very good documentaries I have seen about Manhattan on September 11 pack the emotional punch of this one. It is the only one I have kept, after all of these years, the only one I show. It is simply the best.",1389052800,,1880,4.653614457831325
