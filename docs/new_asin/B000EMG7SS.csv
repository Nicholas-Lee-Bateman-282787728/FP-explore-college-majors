8111375,1,B000EMG7SS,"In Concert/Young Girl, Gary Puckett and The Union Gap. Very misleading. This is nothing but videos from 1984 that are available on youtube. I was very upset when the DVD did not work on my player. Then I looked at the songlist and discovered this DVD was not true to the cover. I asked for my money back and they did that. I would not deal with this group again.",1348617600,,362,4.185714285714286
8111376,1,B000EMG7SS,"Dragonfly, I totally agree with your assessment of this video. The reason for the lousy quality is that it's a bootleg of a live performance which took place in 1984, per Gary Puckett, at Doc Severinsen's Theater in Oklahoma City, OK.  Gary Puckett never authorized anyone to videotape this performance, & I've discovered that numerous other recording artists were similarly victimized at this same venue & in the same time frame.

The VHS footage was mothballed for about 20 years & ended up in Europe, where it was tranferred to DVD & offered for sale in record stores in Germany, England, the Netherlands, & Belgium, as well as on the Internet on eBay, MusicStack, & on Amazon.com.  The initial version of this DVD came out in early 2004 with a different packaging slick than the one shown on Amazon's listing.  Another version came out about a year later with a different bar code than the initial version, & a third version came out in 2005 or 2006 with the packaging slick shown on Amazon, with a different bar code than the first two versions.  The entity which assigns bar codes to merchandise informed me that it has no record of any of the bar codes shown on the packaging slicks, & further informed me that on identical items, the bar codes are supposed to be identical.  In other words, whoever manufactured these DVDs simply made up the bar codes shown on the packaging slicks.

The points made by Dragonfly are typical of what one finds in a bootleg item.  The video & audio quality is lousy, the item may not even play on certain DVD players, & the artist receives no royalties on sales of such items.  The customer ends up paying for an item that's substandard & the likelihood of a refund is slim to none.

I've spent the last 4 years getting listings of this item removed on Gary's behalf from eBay & MusicStack, & to date, approximately 75 listings have been removed.  I've asked Amazon to remove listings of this item but have received no communication from them.  Hopefully, this review will get their attention.  Dragonfly, I'm really sorry you've been victimized.

The Union Gap disbanded in the early 70's & the members have gone on to other pursuits.  One is a retired music teacher, another is a successful songwriter in Nashville, another plays sax for Flash Cadillac & the Continental Kids, & the last one is a booking agent in the music industry.  Gary's current band consists of a keyboard player, bass player, & drummer, while Gary plays guitar.  He continues to perform at venues all over the country, & anyone who wants to know where he's performing can log onto his website at [...] & then click on the Tour icon.",1217548800,5,2647,4.645922746781116
8111377,1,B000EMG7SS,"After searching for ages for a good Gary Puckett DVD, I'm very disappointed with this ""Young Girl"" DVD.  Don't let the cover fool you.  Let me go into detail:

1)  This is just Gary Puckett in the 80's without the Union Gap, a back up band..yes..but not the Union Gap.  Gary sings all the songs different from the original.

2)  This is a crappy production.  Live footage were shot with a hand held VHS camera from a distance.  Audio is just as bad.  Certain songs, no live footage...just the audio with still pictures!!

3)  This is a PAL DVD, not NTSC.  So if you do not have an all regions DVD player, do not buy this DVD. Unfortunatey I do, so I had to skip thru this crappy DVD.

4)  The only good clip was the last section with Gary & the real Union Gap in the '60s doing Lady Willpoweer.  But the audio & the lips do not sync either.  Maybe because the audio was dubbed in.",1192838400,8,880,4.142857142857143
