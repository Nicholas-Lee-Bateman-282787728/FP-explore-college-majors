3059016,5,B00113ALM2,My daughter loves this book and was racking up my verizon bill watching it online so I purchased the DVD which has many other stories on it as well. She loves the Inch By Inch story too. Great buy and now my verizon bill is back to normal.,1343865600,,239,4.0
3059017,4,B00113ALM2,Great dvd to go along with the story of Chicka Chicka Boom Boom! It also has several other scholastic stories on it. Both my daughter and my preschool class loved all the stories!,1334188800,,179,4.454545454545454
3059018,5,B00113ALM2,"This is one of my favorite Scholastic Read-along DVDs! The stories are all so CUTE!!!

CHICKA CHICKA BOOM BOOM is a great alphabet sing! It has a very singable chorus (I'm a music teacher, so I really appreciate a good sing-along story!), and is animated very well

WILD ABOUT BOOKS is an adorable story with very current references to popular children's books. The animals are illustrated by the same guy that illustrates the ""Arthur"" series, although I find these illustrations even more whimsical than Arthur. The best part is during the credits, they made fake bloopers!!!! SO funny and cute!!!!!

INCH BY INCH is a great story about an inchworm who proves his usefulness by measuring different parts of different birds (the tail of a robin, the legs of a stork, etc.) so that he won't be eaten! He finally comes across a stubborn nightingale who tells him to measure his song or he'll eat the inchworm! Beautifully illustrated, and very cute!

FIVE CREATURES is an awesome book! It's a girl who has a unique way of looking at her family (a mother, a father, and two cats), such as ""There are five creatures in our house. Three that have orange hair and two that have grey hair. Four that like fish, and one that doesn't."" It's a fun new way of looking at any kind of family. It reminds me of the cute little things about my own family that my dad would point out to us. Very creative!

The 3 bonus stories were filmed several years back, which is reflected in the quality of the video (and audio), but it doesn't take away from the experience at all (in my opinion).

BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL is a classic story that I wasn't familiar with, but it has a cute little plot, and the illustrations are very nice! It's about a toddler and her mom picking blueberries, and a mother and baby bear eating blueberries, and what happens when they accidentally cross paths (it's not as violent as it sounds...in fact, it's not violent at all!) There's nothing special about the telling of the story, there's no animation, but it's a nice story, so it's nice to hear!

A STORY, A STORY is my favorite book on this DVD! Between the illustrations and the narrator, it paints such a fascinating, beautiful picture with so much character! I can't say enough about it! The story is about how Anansi won the gold box full of all the stories ever told. As you may know, Anansi is a clever being, so he tricks his way to the solution - I know I've used the word ""cute"" way too much in this review, but it's just so fitting for every one of these stories!!

MILLIONS OF CATS was one of my favorite stories when I was little, so I was excited to see it on this DVD! Like ""Blueberries for Sal"" there's nothing special about it, but it's a nice little story, and I still love it!

SO cute. End of story.",1331251200,11,2779,4.444007858546169
3059019,5,B00113ALM2,"This is my kids favorite movie to watch, they can watch it over and over again and the song is great, catchy and fun to watch",1280361600,,125,3.8461538461538463
3059020,5,B00113ALM2,"My 2 1/2 year-old son *loves* this video. At first it was just ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,"" which is a story about the alphabet with a super-catchy tune. (Different from the Ray Charles version that comes with the book, but good on its own merits.) Then he loved ""Wild About Books,"" a story about the librarian who drives her bookmobile into the zoo and gets all the animals hooked on reading. (Narrated wonderfully by Catherine O'Hara.) This story can be easily enjoyed by a 2-year-old and still has some things that will entertain an adult.

There are just so many great books narrated (and animated) on this DVD: ""Blueberries for Sal"" is a classic, as are ""A Story, a Story,"" ""Inch by Inch,"" and ""Millions of Cats"" (although personally, I don't like the last book). ""Five Creatures"" was new to me, but I also recommend it.

The animations on this DVD and the choices of stories are wonderful. We put on the subtitling, which highlights the words as they are being read. This technique is great for emergent readers to associate the written word with the audio.

We had many of these books before the video, but I have since bought ""A Story a Story"" and ordered ""Wild about Books"" as my son can't get enough of it, and we had to return the library's copy! My guess is that this DVD would probably be enjoyed by most kids through second-grade or so. Highly recommended!!",1275696000,15,1369,4.579591836734694
