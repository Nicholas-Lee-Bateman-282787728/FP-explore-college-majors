7932216,1,B000056N9D,"I loved Howdy Doody as a kid, but decades later the show seemed quite lame. Bob Smith came on like like a product huckster, and He seemed to
 terrify the Kids on stage with Him. I wished I had spent My money on a bottle of Makers Mark instead. It would have been a much better
 investment.",1424563200,,289,4.052631578947368
7932217,5,B000056N9D,"Who doesn't love Howdy Doody and Buffalo Bob? I have so many of the Howdy Doody Shows in my collection that I can't remember exactly what this on was about, but I can say that you just can't go wrong with this classic DVD. Just like all the other Howdy Doody Shows from the 1950's they are in black and white and advertise the sponsor's products as part of the show. This was done quite often in the live 1950's programs. Also, because the shows were presented live, all of the goof ups were left in.  It's a wonderful DVD with all the puppet characters like the silly mixed up Flubadub.  He's part duck, part platypus, is spotted like a leopard and wears a flower pot for a hat. I think that all the characters on this show are real crack-ups. It  just one of the finest children's programs of the early years of television. It's a hoot!",1422662400,,838,4.291139240506329

7932219,5,B000056N9D,"It's great to have these shows available-the 10th anniversary show must be the same one that Buffalo Bob took with him during his campus appearances.  I loved the ""Beautiful Smile"" contest for children during several of the episodes-one of the prizes was an outboard motor! Priceless.",993600000,5,284,5.173913043478261
