8217291,4,B000V92WUG,"Not a bad movie (although I can't believe it was released in '77 - it looks and feels like an early 70's COME DRINK WITH ME knockoff, except for the fighting), and this is probably the best-looking of the Angela Mao flicks available on DVD. It's a shame that more old-school kung-fu and wuxia flicks don't get this kind of treatment.",1379894400,,333,4.475409836065574
8217292,5,B000V92WUG,"I won't rehash the plot. My fellow reviewers have given a very good synopsis. If you like Mao Ying, I highly recommend getting this version. It has English subtitles and no English dubbing. English dubbing often takes away from martial arts films.  When watching an English subtitle version, you realize just how much of the ""flavor"" of these films is lost in translation, due to dubbing. The picture quality is good. I purchased from Hong Kong and received in approximately 3 weeks.

 I found myself really drawn into the plot. It's multifaceted. The storyline goes from an island prison, to an abbey of Buddist monks, to a brothel, and more. It even includes nude scenes. At times, it's very brutal and stark. Other times, it's touching....when the mother of Mao Ying's character delivers her in a prison cell and then dies.

Mao Ying is more than a superb martial artist. She a very good actress, with great screen presence. The supporting cast was good, too. I enjoyed the acting as much as I enjoyed fight scenes. My emotions became engaged and my attention captured. This is one of the better martial arts films I've seen. It's even better that ""Deep Thrust, The Hand of Death"", aka as Lady Hapkido. This one draws you in, similar to the way the classic, ""5 Fingers of Death"" captures the viewers attention.",1334361600,5,1313,4.745614035087719
8217293,4,B000V92WUG,"Angela Mao (""When Taekwondo Strikes"") stars as Pure Lotus, a woman seeking revenge for the murder and/or false imprisonment of her parents, whom she never knew.  In the beginning of the picture her mother (from a prison cell) tells the sad story of her and her husband's betrayal and what she wants done with her newborn daughter.  She dies and the baby is taken to a Buddhist convent by her new godmother where she quickly (about 5 seconds) grows up and masters kung fu.

The plot moves rather quickly once it's established, taking up the first 10-15 minutes.  After that it's almost non-stop fights.  The choreography is a nice stepping-stone between the ""bashers"" and ""shapes"" styles of 70's kung fu flicks.  The action is done by Yuen Woo Ping and is very impressive for 1977.  A little undercranking is noticeable but not overly so.  The fights get faster and more intricate as the movie progresses, but they're decent right from the start.  After all, this is Angela Mao we're talkin' about here.  The addition of Bruce Leung and several members of the Yuen clan (including Sammo Hung) doesn't hurt either.

Fortune Star's remastered print and widescreen format will definitely please old school fans who've waited for years for picture quality that doesn't suck.  The film does NOT have an English dub, as I would prefer, but the subtitles are nicely done.  Actually I prefer the option of both, but as long as there is one I'm a happy camper.  No special features except for a trailer and photo gallery.  Eh, what are you gonna do?  It's still recommended.

8217294,4,B000V92WUG,"Angela Mao was the undisputed queen of Hong Kong-produced kung fu cinema in the 1970s and BROKEN OATH (1977) is arguably her best film and one of the two best showcases for her considerable martial arts expertise. In addition to several superbly staged fight sequences, the film boasts a compelling plotline, strong characters and a solid cast of top-of-the-line Hong Kong performers. It's also beautifully photographed on picturesque locations and spectacular sets, with compositions, lighting, production design and color values on a par with the best Japanese period pieces of the era. Renowned composer Joseph Koo provides an evocative music score based on traditional Chinese melodies and instrumentation.

BROKEN OATH is loosely based on the Japanese swordswoman revenge film, LADY SNOWBLOOD (1973), which I've also reviewed on this site. Here, Angela plays Jie Lian, daughter of a woman who was wrongly imprisoned and died in her cell after giving birth. She's raised by nuns at a Buddhist convent where she learns some awesome kung fu and stick-fighting skills. When she kills a would-be rapist, she's kicked out by the Abbess and sent to live with her godmother (veteran HK actress Wang Lai) who recounts the tale of her mother's sad fate and how four men with Imperial connections killed Angela's father and left her pregnant mother to rot in jail after she gouged the eye of one of the killers in self-defense. Angela then goes on a mission to locate the four men, one by one, and get revenge for her dead parents. She finds unexpected allies in a pair of undercover Imperial agents sent to investigate corrupt practices by Officer Chou, who is somehow tied to the four culprits. It all culminates in a sprawling, nonstop kung fu battle at Chou's mansion.

The fight scenes were staged by Yuen Wo Ping and Hsu Hsia. Yuen, of course, is well-known as a prominent kung fu director himself, as well as fight choreographer on such high-profile films as THE MATRIX and KILL BILL 1 & 2. Among the fighting co-stars here is Bruce Leung, who had a nice run in kung fu films in the 1970s before making a comeback of sorts in KUNG FU HUSTLE (2005) as ""the Beast."" Sammo Hung, a prominent kung fu director in his own right, plays one of the chief opponents in the final battle.

Angela is not only a superb fighter, but a powerful actress and screen presence as well. This role highlights her beauty, too, as she dresses up and develops a ""flirty"" persona to entice the killers she's seeking, going so far as to sell her services to a brothel in order to get close to one of her targets. The main draw, however, remains the high number of fight scenes in which she participates, all with the fury of a full-fledged kung fu diva.

This DVD in the Fortune Star/Legendary Collection line is the best edition yet seen of this film. It's in Mandarin, with English subtitles, is letter-boxed, and made from a sharp original film print with great color values and only the occasional scratch. It rarely gets better than this. Angela's other ""superb showcase"" is WHEN TAEKWONDO STRIKES, also out on DVD from Fortune Star and also reviewed on this site.",1200441600,7,3144,4.795202952029521
