Can't wait to watch more episodes.",1370736000,2,118,4.95
5010763,4,B006OKOZRY,"This is one of my all time favorite TV shows.  It is on one channel that started charging to be seen.
The other shows I have either seen, or don't care to watch.  It was on one night, and I wanted to watch it.
One channel at $5.00 per month to occasionally see Macgyver is riduclious!
I went to my computer to see if Amazon had any DVD's avalible, I'm writing this so that is the answer.
Anyone that has jury-rigged a car to get home knows the Macgyver feeling.
Side-note to fans that want to know,  His first name is Angus.",1361145600,5,524,4.117647058823529

8502081,5,B006OKOZRY,"Enjoying the complete series of Macgyver.  Love the show and RDA is outstanding in his role.  Thank you for bring these back as now I am introducing them to my grandsons who are young but between Power Rangers, ninjago, and various other fighting shows it is nice to show one of Macgyver's.  Found it very helpful when he mentioned science and math helped us get out of a situation.  Also, when the character Macgyver searches and you can explain that he is thinking and looking for solutions from what is available.  Good series!!

Question:  Didn't Macgyver's houseboat get blown up in one of the episodes?",1374883200,2,608,4.733333333333333
