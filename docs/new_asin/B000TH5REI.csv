Highly unlikely most ranges are going to allow you to live fire these drills in their place of business. That's probably a good thing. There is plenty of opportunity to screw this stuff up if you are self training. By screwing up
I mean shooting yourself or someone nearby if your weapons handling is not 100% safe. That's not something you get to bestow on yourself. That's something a well versed firearms instructor needs to judge. I would advise using this DVD in conjunction with SAFE dry fire and live fire only with well trained instructors watching your moves.",1440806400,,698,4.637096774193548
8209478,4,B000TH5REI,"This is the 4th in a series of dvds where civilian students trained in individual protective measures. There is a LOT of good stuff in the whole series and I strongly recommend this one as well. If you are considering carrying a pistol for personal defense, I feel one should at least review this series to get an idea of the responsibility being taken on. You are cheating yourself if all you do is get a concealed carry license, load up a pistol and start packing. This series will help you get your head in the game, and work on solving potential problems and liability issues long before the stuff hits the fan... McCann will tell you awareness and avoidance are key to survival. He ought to know.",1365552000,,701,4.484375
