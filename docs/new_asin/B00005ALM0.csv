7935373,5,B00005ALM0,2 of my favorite old Juvie girls movies of the 50's. One done by the incomparable Ed Wood and the other with my favorite Schlock actor Timothy Farrell,1419120000,,150,4.392857142857143
7935374,2,B00005ALM0,"Lovers of Bad Cinema can't go wrong with this high-camp double feature from the folks at Something Weird Video - complete with drive-in ads, juvenile-delinquency shorts and schlock trailers. Everyone knows that Ed Wood wrote the screenplay for ""The Violent Years,"" even though his name was omitted from the opening credits. Nevertheless, this 1956 saga of Girls Gone Bad has enough non-acting and Woodian dialogue to satisfy his most ardent fans. Cut from the same low-budget cloth, ""Girl Gang"" is even more wretched and decidedly less fun. Don't forget to bring a six-pack when you watch this smorgasbord of exploitative celluloid.",1055462400,,632,5.267326732673268
7935375,1,B00005ALM0,"I sent this back after finding out the drive-in trailers have the letters ""SWV"" superimposed onscreen!  I bought this just for these trailers, the movies are unvandalized but I won't buy any more titles from Something Weird because of this.",1045008000,14,240,5.0
7935376,5,B00005ALM0,"Something Weird Video does it again with this great double-feature of girls gone wrong - teenage terror!
THE VIOLENT YEARS tells the story of rich kid Paula Parkins (Jean Moorhead) who rebels against her parents and joins a gang of devil-dolls who rob gas stations and take men up into the woods and rape them (....).  Also featuring Barbara Weeks, Teresa Hancock and Joanne Cangi, it was scripted by the one and only Edward D. Wood Jr (PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE)!.
GIRL GANG tells the story of a group of girls who'll do anything for a hit of dope, and the disgusting old men who take advantage.  When not engaged in marijuana make-out parties, they are committing robberies to feed their habit!  Starring Joanne Arnold, Mary Lou O'Connor and Timothy Farrell.
Of course, the big advantage is the ""Let's Go To The Drive-In"" feature which couples the two films together along with concession stand ads, intermission shorts and two featurettes entitled ""Goof Balls and Tea"" and ""What About Juvenile Delinquency?"".
Be sure to check out the other fantastic double features from Something Weird Video, including THE NOTORIOUS DAUGHTER OF FANNY HILL/THE HEAD MISTRESS and BAD GIRLS GO TO HELL/ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER MAN.",1013731200,12,1209,4.945812807881773
7935377,4,B00005ALM0,"I've been a big fan of Something Weird's Drive-in Double Feature series and this disc is no exception. Both main films are of the Juvenile Delinquent genre which at its best features over-the-top performances and non-stop action. The first feature ""The Violent Years"" was written by Ed Wood Jr. (Plan 9 From Outer Space). Even though he didn't direct this film, the dialog is convoluted, clunky and hysterical.
The second feature is the real find though. ""Girl Gang"" never lets up. It opens with a pot/heroin party, features robberies, violence, a gang bang initiation, sneering dope pushers looking to get the kids ""hooked"", a drunken doctor who performs operations on the kitchen table, and ends just as suddenly as it starts. The tone is manic, it never lets up for a second, and it goes beyond ""Reefer Madness"" from 20 years earlier which is it's obvious influence. Despite both films' ""shocking"" subject matter they are very tame in that 50's sort of way and probably wouldn't go beyond a G rating today.
The extras on the disc are a blast. There are two shorts, one ""Goof Balls and Tea"" which is a police training film from the fifties tells us that kids begin with goof balls and then graduate to marijuana. The second of the shorts ""What About Juvenile Delinquency?"" is a centron production. Most likely directed by Herk Harvey, the director of the seminal cult horror film ""Carnival of Souls"", it's worth looking at to see how he made his bread and butter.
There are 5 listed trailers for other JD flicks and a hidden one for ""Teenage Mother"", which is the best of the bunch. (Just click around, you'll find it.) There is also a second easter egg which shows a brief scene from ""The Violent Years"". Wrap this all up with Something Weird's Drive-in feature which gives you the option to watch it all, drive-in intermissions, shorts, trailers, features, and you have a great little package. Overall this is a lot of fun and I'm very happy to have it in my collection.
If I have any real critique it would be that I'd like to see even more trailers packed onto the disc as they have with others in this series.
I highly recommend any of Something Weird Video's Drive-in Double Feature sets.",990835200,6,2196,4.677002583979328
