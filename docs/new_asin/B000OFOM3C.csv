8184866,1,B000OFOM3C,"I have had some trouble with this product repeatedly. When I first ordered the product [DVD] it would not play in my computer or my DVD player for my TV. In fact I had to have technical help from Apple to even eject the DVD from my computer. I sent the original DVD back and ordered another copy. But I also had problems with this DVD. It would play on my computer but not on DVD player for the TV. I also could not access the closed captioning for this product. It is a pain to keep sending something like this product back so because I could use it IN A LIMITED MANNER I kept it. I could not and would not, however, recommend it to anyone else. Thank you for my opportunity to share my disappointment with this product.",1362096000,4,721,4.1571428571428575
