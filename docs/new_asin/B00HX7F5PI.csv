8637078,1,B00HX7F5PI,"Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, 2009 film

It starts in the dusty southwest, a man drives a car to a deserted place with a young woman. Its not what you expect! Its back to 1981, two men and a woman drive in the dark to see a movie. People watch the screen and not other people. [Believable?] They return with another woman. Her screams are futile. Next its San Antonio Texas, the police have a prisoner. Henry doesnt like live ones, they talk too much! Henry likes milk shakes. He talks about past murders to the Sheriff and a news reporter. It began back in West Virginia. His mother entertains a male visitor. [Absent father.] His mother humiliated him with school clothes. The family is poor. The parents argue, his father lost a leg in a railroad accident. [Do they know what creates serial murderers?]

Henry talks about his past murders. [This seems like sensationalism. Was this possible in a small rural village?] He serves his first sentence digging ditches. [Hard labor.] When he returns home he confronts his mother. Its ten years for second degree murder. He tries suicide in prison. He is given electroshock therapy. [Does this work?] He is not compliant [a form of torture?]. He will go back to prison and then be paroled. He met a man in a soup kitchen. The travel together and commit murders. They didn't get caught - there were no policemen around. They pick up a female hitchhiker who pays for her ride. More than she expected? A District Attorney arrives to straighten out Henrys confessions. Was he elsewhere?

The DA is escorted out of the jail (a non-believer in guilt). There is a flashback to an earlier time. He argues with his girlfriend and takes her for a ride. Henry keeps a hunting knife in his glovebox. What did he do with her body? He chopped her up into small pieces and buried them all over Texas. [Is he insane or just faking it?] In 1996 Henry was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life in prison by Governor George W. Bush. Henry died in 2001 from heart failure.

After the end credits they say this story is fictional and any similarity to any real person or event is coincidental! That is a legal way to avoid any civil suits for any reason. If there is a book on Henry Lee Lucas and his crimes it will have more information. What if it depends on Henrys self-serving statements? How accurate will it be? I wonder about all those young women being hitchhikers. Overall, this movie lacks any redeeming social value. You can compare it to other movies about serial murderers, such as Citizen X. Or you could read a book about Dr. H. H. Holmes in Chicago. Their lesson is to beware of any stranger who wants to help you. But some will choose to be fooled with promises.",1441756800,,2740,4.52929292929293
