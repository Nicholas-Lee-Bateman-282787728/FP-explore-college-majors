2397361,3,B000AYEL6A,"A video tribute to The Wahington Redskins' greatest triumphs; JOhn Riggins on 4th down in Superbowl XVII, Doug Williams' amazing 2nd quarter in Superbowl XXII and Mark Rypien's season to remember culminating in Superbowl XXVII. Then there's the disappointments; Miami in Superbowl VII and can anyone say Marcus Allen? Plenty of memorable moments and players to look back on and to show younger fans what it was like when The Redskins ruled the game. A little bit dissapointed in the bonus features and the fact that there isn't more footage from the regular seasons and play-offs when we went to the Superbowl.  Fun to watch nonetheless but NFL films can do better.",1165017600,,665,4.9375
2397362,4,B000AYEL6A,"Excellent DVD for those who like to reminisce the glory days.  Only thing I didn't like about the DVD set is that I felt there weren't enough highlights from the game nor the season.  They should show more highlights from each Redskins' game of the season.  Perhaps one day they should release a Superbowl series with the entire Superbowl game (from start to finish) in it, instead of just highlights.",1142380800,7,401,4.7
2397363,5,B000AYEL6A,"Great Super Bowl highlights, but I would have really enjoyed it if it had shown more of the Redskins seasons, rather than spending most of the time showing all the other teams in the NFL.  Otherwise, an excellent transaction!!  AAAAA+++++",1141084800,2,238,4.925

2397365,5,B000AYEL6A,"This set includes three documentaries, one each on the '82, '87 and '91 seasons, when the Redskins won their three Super Bowls.

The first part of each documentary deals with regular season play, and features all 28 teams (pre-expansion), with no particular focus on the Redskins until the playoffs.  There is particularly good coverage of the '86 Saints, '91 Falcons and the '82 and '91 Cowboys.  The best and slickest presentation is reserved for the '91 season.

Highlights:
- Tremendous Cowboy sack on Joe Theismann from the '82 season.

- Darrell Green returning a punt for a touchdown in an NFC playoff against Chicago in a freezing Soldier Field. Walter Payton's last game.

- Second Quarter of Superbowl XXII, of course, when the Redskins score 35 unanswered points.

- The Lions' Barry Sanders scoring a classic TD against the Cowboys in an NFC playoff game.

- Great blocking and tackling throughout from the Redskins. See (and hear) the great Jim Kelly get manhandled and mauled in Super Bowl XXVII.

- Short ten-minute film about NFL legend Coach Joe Gibbs, the man who changed the NFC East.  According to the late Will McDonough, when Bill Parcels became head coach for the New York Giants he decided to increase the size of his linemen in direct response to what Gibbs was doing in Washington.  Later Dallas did the same thing, as they also had to face Washington at least twice a year.  These 300 plus pound linemen helped the NFC East win eight (and counting) Super Bowls since 1983.

Lowlights (minor quibbles):

- Warning to New York fans: the Giants are probably the least visible team in this DVD set.  This is strange considering they were defending Super Bowl champions in the '87 and '91 seasons.

- We don't see Jay Schroeder throw the ball at all, even though he had a great arm.  We do, however, see him getting sacked four or five times as a Redskin and as a Raider.

- Cheesy 80's music in the documentary for the '82 and '87 seasons.

- Broadcast NFL games are usually seen from a high angle, but a lot of NFL films' footage is on ground level, and close-up, so that you are sometimes lost as a viewer (you don't always see down-field blocking or the play developing).  On the plus side you see close-up tackles you don't always see on TV broadcasts.

- Perhaps a few too many slow-motion shots.

Regrets: I know John Madden and Pat Summerall don't work for NFL films, but it would have been great if they could have done a commentary on these discs.

Summary: 5 stars, because it's the Washington Redskins.",1139788800,17,2536,4.63677130044843

2397382,5,B000AYEL6A,"I learned a great deal about the Redskins. The championship teams not only used three different quarterbacks with different skills, but the most of the skill positions were completely different players. The offensive lines were very different over the three Super Bowls. I was surprised to learn that the Dallas franchise used blackmail to get the Redskin owner to vote them into the league. They bought the rights to ""Hail to the Redskins"", and told the owner he could not play the song at game unless he voted for them.",1445904000,,521,4.8

I was hoping for more Norm Snead, Sonny Jurgenson Sam Huff and Bobby Mitchell than was supplied but overall this is an excellent history of the team. The NFL history formula is grossly overproduced but even making the fullest allowance for some of this cringe-worthy production, the history gives a great feel for the Redskins and their relationship to the city of Washington DC",1283472000,,496,4.77906976744186

2397415,4,B000AYEL6A,"NFL SUPER BOWL COLLECTION - WASHINGTON REDSKINS assembles three NFL Films documentaries, each detailing a NFL season which ultimately led to a Redskin Super Bowl victory. This is a must-have for Redskin fans. The years since the last Super Bowl appearance may have been barren, but that only makes these memories sweeter.

All three documentaries have the same structure. Each runs an hour. The first half details the entire season as a whole. Most of the notable teams of that year are given at least a mention and the compelling story-lines are given plenty of discussion. As the season and playoffs progress, teams fall by the wayside, leaving us with only two.

The second half of each documentary is focused solely on that season's Super Bowl with most important plays and stories described in typical NFL Films style.  If you've ever watched ESPN at an odd time of day, you'll almost sure to have seen an NFL Films production of this kind. You know the sort of thing: grainy film of a pig-skin flying through the air in a perfect spiral; slow motion, low angle footage of players taking the field; John Facenda speaking in reverential tones of the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field.

In addition to the Super Bowl seasons, there are four mini-documentaries ranging in length from four and a half to nine minutes each.  ""The Fun Bunch"" looks at the style of touchdown celebration used by Redskin players in the days before the No Fun League really began to crack down on the display of any human emotion.  ""John Riggins"" and ""Doug Williams"" document the careers of those two star athletes with the latter focusing on the history of Williams being the first black quarterback to start in a Super Bowl.

The ""Joe Gibbs"" feature has the longest running length and details Gibbs' career and his coaching style (note that this film is from 1996 and thus predates his return to the game in 2004).  The final tale is of particular interest in this set given that Washington's only three championships in the Super Bowl era (so far) have come with Gibbs under the headset.

The mini-documentaries are pretty good, although given their shortness it's difficult for them to really delve into any sort of detail about their subject.  Still for most of them (particularly ""The Fun Bunch"") it's really just an excuse to release some game footage that would otherwise never fit anywhere else.  And in that manner, they succeed.

This set is a great nostalgia trip for any Redskins fan who grew up in the 1980s or for anyone who had fond memories of that Redskins dynasty.  It's great to see all the old footage of the players and coaches from that era, and it's even great to hear Frank Herzog's voice doing the play-by-play.  So many faces and names from that era: John Riggins, Joe Theismann, Mark Moseley, Joe Jacoby, Charles Mann, Dexter Manley, Doug Williams, Ricky Sanders, Art Monk, Gary Clark, Darrell Green, Jeff Bostic,  Mark Rypien...

As always, NFL Films do a solid and professional job at relaying the action.  If there is a downside for Redskin fans, it's that in the first half of the season documentaries, the Redskins must share time with the other twenty-seven teams in the league, and thus don't get a huge amount of time devoted to them.

It's says something that just a week after the end of what turned out to be a fairly unsettling and depressing Redskins season, I popped one of these DVDs into the player and very quickly found my Redskin fanaticism returning.  Until the folks down at Redskins Park get their act together, watching these three past victories will have to suffice.",1230854400,3,3595,4.760064412238325
2397416,5,B000AYEL6A,"Well, being from Chicago naturally I am a Bears fan; however, I am a football fan first and I must say that I loved the ""History of the Washington Redskins"".  The 1st disc is very comprehensive, detailing the history of the Redskins and atmosphere of the Washington, DC area in the 50's and 60's and some good insight on the racism of the times, (the owner refused to have Black men on his team, in fact, the Redskins were the last team to have Black men on their roster).  The 2nd disc has interviews with prominent Redskin players, Theismann and particularly one of my all time favorite backs Mr. John Riggins!

This is a great dvd set of the Washington Redskins!  Now, if NFL Networks would only produce the Minnesota Vikings, the Houston Oilers, the Buffalo Bills and the San Diego Chargers ""History of"", I would be in football heaven!!
