5361033,2,B009QMB1JC,"This was a disappointment. I found it difficult to follow because the moves
 were not explained. It would have helped if Mr. Kirchhoff would have turned around occasionally, with his back to the viewers, so we could more easily follow left and right movements. Sorry. I have taken tai chi classes before, and this one just didn't measure up.",1471996800,18,341,4.779661016949152

5361039,5,B009QMB1JC,This Program has helped countless senior citizens and handicapped individuals have the ability to participate in some form of mental and physical exercise.  It has helped me become more limber and regulate my breathing .My stress level goes down when I use the techniques and exercises on the video.  Highly recommended for anyone of any age.

5361061,5,B009QMB1JC,This not only gives a very easy tai-chi exercise but also teaches breathing exercises.

8543777,5,B009QMB1JC,"This is an excellent workout for older folks who can't perform all the standing exercises in most programs.  It lasts about 50 minutes, but you can do as much as you are able each day and still get the benefits.  I love this!",1529366400,,225,4.209302325581396
8543778,4,B009QMB1JC,"I have never tried Tai Chi until now. I have numerous injuries that plague me as I age, so I decided to start slow with this and see if I like it. Very different type of exercise from traditional types I learned. But, decided to be fair and give it a go. I have heard so much about it, and a friend loves it. Face massage was weird, but I guess it is a pressure point type of therapy to affect the whole person, from what I understood.
Exercises were all doable for me, except there were enough repetitions that my shoulder began to act up. So, I did a few, and fast forwarded as I needed to. Had to quit on the shoulder exercises the last 10 minutes. Next time, I will reduce the number of reps I do so I can do the tape all the way through. Lasted 51 minutes.
I have to say that I do hold my breath while exercising. Bad habit that is hard to break. Breathing in and out is stressed throughout the video, so you eventually do start to do it on your own. That alone is a big help to train me to be better at that, even on my own.
I was VERY, VERY relaxed by the end. Pleasantly so. More relaxed than I remember feeling in a long time. I can see why this type of exercise and focus helps with overall health and tension! I have trouble sleeping, and I do think that, despite it being exercise, this could help lower my heart rate and relax me for an easier time of falling asleep. His voice is calm and soothing, the repetition of breathing and doing the motions also contributed.
I will keep with it a few days a week.
Negatives: He says this is the first part of a five-part series. The Amazon ad didn't mention that, or maybe I missed it. There is no video length listed on the case. I think there should be. It is not divided into chapters to allow you to skip and start right in on the exercises. Almost no explanations are given about what this particular exercise will help with, etc. No explanations about facial massage until some comments about the ear. I wish there was. Maybe it would disrupt or become monotonous to have to hear it each time the video is played. An insert could solve the problem. I like to know why i am doing something, not just blindly following. I will be sold on it if I understand, but tend to lose interest if I am not convinced. i will have to do a little research to see what facial massage is supposed to accomplish and to make sure I do it right.",1529020800,2,2387,4.113490364025696
8543779,5,B009QMB1JC,I love this video and hope to progress to the next level soon.,1528329600,,62,3.8461538461538463
