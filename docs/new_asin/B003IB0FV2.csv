4126082,5,B003IB0FV2,"My daughter loves Super Why, and she has learned so much from watching them.  The only thing I don't like about this set of episodes is that the Tooth Fairy sings in a ""racy"" voice, but I'm not so much a prude that I don't let my daughter watch it or anything; it's just a different style of music than we're used to.",1326326400,3,317,4.031746031746032
4126083,5,B003IB0FV2,We love Super Why! at this house. We recently received this DVD as a gift from good friends. We have found this to be another great SW DVD that the kiddo loves to interact with. We are always amazed at how mesmerized she is and how much she follows their storylines. Great DVD. Highly recommend.,1325462400,,295,4.381818181818182
4126084,5,B003IB0FV2,"We love Super Why and all the episodes on this DVD.  The stories entertain our 3 year old while teaching him letters and reading.  We work on learning letters at home and this DVD helps reinforce what we teach our son.  My only complaint is the large number of commercials on the DVD.  I wish they would leave those out.  Overall, a great purchase.",1324944000,5,348,4.375

4126086,5,B003IB0FV2,Bought this my my 3 yr old son for his birthday.  He never saw the show before.  I bought it because it was voted as one of the top educational DVDs for pre-schoolers.

Love the power to Read!,1320796800,8,356,4.1911764705882355
4126087,5,B003IB0FV2,"Every morning, the first words out of my toddler's mouth are ""I want to watch Super Why."" He loves all of the PBS shows, but especially this one. I used to sit and try to teach him the alphabet with paper and crayons, but it wasn't going so well. He started watching Super Why and literally two weeks later, he knows all of his letters and is constantly pointing out letters we see when we go out!",1297555200,7,397,4.1688311688311686

4126089,1,B003IB0FV2,"When I received this DVD, my son got so excited. But when I opened the cover, the DVD was cracked. Therefore, my son was crying so bad b/c he wasn't able to watch it. So I emailed the SELLER asking what happened and if I can exchange it for a new one. No response. So then I emailed him again, once again, no response. Now I'm asking for my money back...still no reply back. This seller does NOT have the common courtesy to respond back to my request. Step up and take care of your customers. If he/she can't even do that, then they need to find another day time job!!!!!!!!!!!",1289865600,2,577,4.207207207207207

4126113,4,B003IB0FV2,"Had to make a move over to Hawaii and that's an awful 6-hour flight. I knew I needed some things to keep my child entertained and this was one of them. Bought a DVD player, some Phineas and Ferb DVDs, and Super Why!!! Super Why kept my son fully entertained and was fantastic to keep him engaged. He was one when he understood the alphabet, now he's two and knows the full alphabet. It's partly because of Super Why, because when I need to work, Super Why is my supplemental training tool. It re-emphasizes what I've taught my son, and is a great visual that's fun for him. He loves it. So when we were on the flight, he got to learn reading skills from Mom and Wyatt, the star of the show. Watching Wyatt, then watching Mom do sign language, my son made it through the long flight with only one fuss: he couldn't get out of his seat when everyone was leaving the plane after landing. Hahaha! Success!!!",1382659200,,903,4.317647058823529
4126114,5,B003IB0FV2,This arrived in a timely manner.  My kid loves the DVD and it stays in rotation.  The only thing I wish they would do to the DVDs is have the option for auto play and to repeat the DVD without me having to constantly do it.,1375920000,,223,3.8260869565217392

4126120,5,B003IB0FV2,"Superwhy! has to be one of our very favorite kids' shows!  I really love that the kids not only learn to recognize the letters of the alphabet, but they also learn the sounds they each make and how the sounds come together to form words.  Its a great show for boys and girls, with superheroes, princesses, and all sorts of fairytales.  I also really love that it teaches kids to go to books to get information when they need help.",1344470400,,430,4.35

8397299,1,B003IB0FV2,"While the show overall is educational and production values seem reasonable, unlike other dvds of this show, this one has some very sneaky ads inserted.

To be specific, after the opening segment of each episode but before the main action begins, there's a quick, about 15 second commercial for Chuck E. Cheese's which tries to encourage child viewers to access the Chuck E. Cheese URL. If a parent were to start the episode and walk away for a couple of minutes, they'd have no idea that there's such an ad there at all.

I tolerate PBS advertising their other kids' shows on these dvds. This is the first time I've found this kind of ad, especially so sneakily inserted, and I hope that it will be the last (it occurs in at least two of the four episodes). I am dismayed and deeply irritated that PBS made such a choice.",1503360000,,822,4.473333333333334
