8434791,3,B004LT714Y,"This is a well done introductory guide to sabre fencing.  It's appropriate for someone just starting out in beginner classes.  It covers basic foot work and blade work.  If you've already learned basic foot work and basic blade work, this DVD will be repetitive.  If you are an intermediate to advanced fencer, I don't think this DVD will offers much value.",1355529600,4,357,4.80327868852459
8434792,5,B004LT714Y,Great dvd for the young fencer. My 12 year old little brother uses it on days he doesn't have class. 1 Hour 30 Minute video marking all aspects of sabre fencing. Would recommend to all aspiring sabre fencers who want to practice at home.,1320796800,6,237,4.409090909090909
