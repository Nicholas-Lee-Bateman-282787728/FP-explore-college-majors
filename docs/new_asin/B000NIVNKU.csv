2769233,4,B000NIVNKU,This yoga DVD is great for those who r looking into ashtanga yoga as a day to day practice. I wouldve like some features like turning the voice directions on/off and the music only.,1346630400,5,181,4.352941176470588
2769234,5,B000NIVNKU,"I've bought several yoga DVD's in retail stores over the past few years. Looked here on Amazon & read the reviews for this one, and bought it. It's challenging, but very good for a yoga DVD.  It's not particularly for a beginner but could be if you're ambitious. Be careful with the poses - I did put a light strain on my calf muscle; outside of that, it makes you sweat a lot & it's got a nice pace to it.  Highly recommend for mid-level Yoga practitioners on up.",1331596800,5,464,4.202247191011236
2769235,4,B000NIVNKU,"Don't let the ""Introduction"" in the title make you think that these are beginner poses. The DVD has a lot of great information if you are just starting to practice, but as a beginner, I struggled with a lot of the poses (even the modified version). I think it is a great DVD, but if you are a beginner, don't expect to be able to do all the poses comfortably. I was a bit sore and exhausted after completing it. I have taken yoga classes before, so while I am a beginner, I am able to do most of the basic beginner poses sucessfully, just not some of the poses in this DVD.",1331510400,9,573,4.079646017699115
2769236,5,B000NIVNKU,"This is a beginner level intro to Ashtanga video. Ashtanga is a vigorous vinyasa style of yoga and can be challenging for the average person. The video is slower paced and also talks you through every pose. The production is very basic with no frills or fancy editing or effects. It's just as a yoga video should be. Richard is well respected Ashtanga yoga instructor and has a very calming and soothing voice. He also chants in the intro.
This appears to be the same video as the older one (blue cover)...I had borrowed the older one from the library before purchasing. Just has an updated cover and label.",1329955200,15,607,4.577981651376147
2769237,4,B000NIVNKU,"When the video first started going I was intimidated by the pace of the movements. There's really no, ""Hey, here's what we're about to do, so get ready"" part. For this reason, I recommend watching the different movements once to get an idea of the flow, then doing it.

The best part of this CD for me is the constant insight and talk about how to get in and out of the movements and what you should be thinking about. It seems like hearing her talk constantly while you're trying to have a relaxing/connecting experience would be be detrimental, but I found it very helpful. Each rotation she gives you more insight into each move and what you want to do to get the most out of it. Great for a beginner like me.

Breathing section is great. I would have liked a little more help on breathing while going through the moves, but the little you do get on this is helpful.",1324944000,7,869,4.325153374233129
2769238,4,B000NIVNKU,"I've taken a handful of yoga classes over the years, but wanted to get a DVD that was simple and traditional. This video is just that. Challenging but still not over my head. I like to think I'm somewhat athletic and flexible; some of the positions are too challenging, but i am able to do others. I look forward to getting into some of Richard's most challenging positions in this DVD as my practice improves.",1315008000,10,410,4.48
2769239,5,B000NIVNKU,"Richard Freeman is an amazing yoga instructor. His voice is very steady, calm and soothing. I enjoy the chanting in the beginning as well as the slow pace of the vinyasa. Surprisingly, the pace makes the asanas even more challenging. The video appears to be old but that seems to add to the charm and authenticity of the material being presented. There is no music and very little distraction in the set which makes for a fairly intense yoga session.
I would recommend this for someone who has had some level of Ashtanga instruction in the classroom. Some of the postures are difficult to learn from a DVD, although Richard does a terrific job of explaining them.",1309392000,3,663,4.6752136752136755
2769240,5,B000NIVNKU,"The way he does cobra and down-dog (The transition between the two poses) does something kinky to my lower back so instead going straight from cobra and hiking my pelvis up from there to downdog, I bend my knees and then use my legs to push my pelvis up.  I don't know why the way they show in the video hurts my back since I don't suffer from lower back pain, but the video is the traditional way of doing it.  Overall there is good instruction on breathing and poses.  The menu gives you the follwoing options if you just want to work on something specific for the day.

2769241,5,B000NIVNKU,"Great DVD, just need to know your limits. For the person that says ""not for beginners..."" isn't watching the DVD carefully enough. They have a male counterpart doing alternate variations of moves/holds/locks/etc. Also, if you feel your body doesn't want to go further, or/and you need work on a specific area, don't let the DVD dictate that for: stop the DVD and work on that area. I don't agree that you have to go full blown out into the 90 minute routine (I think the one on the DVD is shorter though). Do the ""practice"" within YOUR ability. Don't worry about what everyone else says or does, just push yourself a little more every time. Remember, it's a DVD, and being as such there isn't one thing for everyone. Otherwise we would all be able to do the things that Kino can do.

In short, use some common sense, follow Kino or the other person, and relax and enjoy yourself. The stuff is harder than it looks. The only thing I could do without is the prayer in the beginning. I am not doing this for the spiritual aspect of it, and there is others like myself. But I just ignore it and focus on the physical benefits of Ashtanga Yoga.",1386633600,3,1139,4.398104265402844
2769242,5,B000NIVNKU,This video is very well done.  Richard Freeman takes his time with each pose so you really get the full benefit. I highly recommend it,1386115200,2,134,4.36
2769243,5,B000NIVNKU,"I'm new to YTT and I struggled with learning the script, benefits and the routine.  This video assisted with my learning and it was simple. I love it.  Great Introduction and I've been doing Ashtanga for 3 months.",1380844800,,213,4.578947368421052
2769244,3,B000NIVNKU,"Don't judge Kino MacGregor by her gorgeous look, blond hair, beautiful body, toe rings, short shorts, and colorful make-up although I have to admit that her physical attributes appeal to me personally. So go ahead anyway. It should have ended there for me watching her free YouTube videos. Why did I pay for her videos and plan to sign up for her classes when she's in town? Not to mention taking my time to write a review of her DVD.

She deserves to have more good words spread around about her. There are two reasons to buy her products. First, she is an expert practicing and demonstrating very difficult postures of this hard-core Yoga style. Ms. MacGregor keeps going back for further training in Mysore, India, and is one of very few certified Ashtanga instructors in the world. Second, she shares her knowledge of Ashtanga with passion and dedication of a genuine teacher. With her pleasant voice and intonation, Ms. MacGregor is generous with all aspects of Ashtanga how-tos. Her instructions tell us what body parts are folded, bended, twisted, lengthened, shortened, and breathed into and out of. ""Suck in your belly and draw your energy in."" ""Use your shoulder girdles. "" She generously dispenses techniques and tips. Law of Attraction works for her that the more (advice either paid or gratis) she gives, the more (money or compliments) she gets.

What I like about this DVD is the opening and closing mantras with their Sanskrit transliteration and English translation. Another instructor, Tim Feldmann lays a superb groundwork for anyone wishing to practice Ashtanga Yoga. The foundation of Ashtanga is that breaths lead (to) movements. For this reason, the extensive instructions, particularly the Vinyasa chapter, go in deeply to explain why and how each movement and breath is in sync and coordinates. ""Otherwise, it's not Ashtanga,"" says Mr. Feldmann. Moreover, the video offers side-by-side comparisons of the advanced practitioner (Ms. MacGregor) and the beginner or less flexible (performed by another instructor, Greg Nardi).

However, for reasons unknown, Introduction to Ashtanga Yoga does not state when Vinyasas are performed between asanas. Given that this is aimed as the Introduction, breath counts should have been mentioned. Generally, practitioners who are familiar with Ashtanga know that each pose is held for five breaths with the exception of asanas in the closing sequence. Ms. Macgregor casually says ten breaths for a final pose, Utapahih. One star is taken off for not stating the importance of Dristi in this video. Gaze points are not consistently included even though they are one for the foundations of Ashtanga. At one point or another, ""looking up"" during the float is uttered non-chalantly. In addition, different camera angles to show body alignments would add more to the title's name and be more useful to viewers.

The video starts out with Sun Salutations A and B but ends at the 25th asana of the Primary Series. I suspect that a reason has to do with being ""The Introduction,"" therefore not featuring all poses in the first Series.

Despite some shortcomings of the video (three out of five stars), it is a must-have DVD that a serious Ashtangi should have. Introduction to Ashtanga Yoga with Kino MacGregor, Greg Nardi and Tim Feldmann is certainly an excellent supplement to books and other instructional resources out there. This product is not 100% perfect. By the time you watch all of Ms. MacGregor's videos, buy all of her books and attend her classes, you should be well versed in Ashtanga.

The late Guruji instilled in her many, many qualities of a great teacher. Kino-ji (if I may call her with the suffix ""ji"") is now one of our finest instructors in the crowded Yoga field. Most of all, Ms. MacGregor inspires us to go beyond our physical limitations and to reach spiritual transcendence through the practice of Ashtanga Yoga.",1371427200,16,3894,5.029457364341085
2769245,5,B000NIVNKU,I really enjoy this DVD. I felt amazing afterwards and will definitely use this over and over again. I don't have an ashtanga yoga instructor in my area and this DVD will definitely help me further my practice. I recommend it to anyone interested in beginning their practice. Plus...I absolutely love Kino! She is amazing and incredibly motivating.,1365724800,,348,5.017241379310345
2769246,5,B000NIVNKU,As a beginner it gives you all you need to start Ashtanga Yoga. Very helpful to build up your daily practice.,1364947200,,109,4.238095238095238
2769247,5,B000NIVNKU,"Fantastic yoga dvd choice. As a yoga teacher I really appreciated the special features that were included in this set. Some yoga background, a breathing lesson, very fun especially if you are just discovering yoga. Although this is labled an introduction to ashtanga it is in no way just for beginners. There are several very difficult postures that assure more experienced yogis will not be bored but also new students have something to look forward and aspire to. I really enjoy this for my own use at home. I love being a yoga teacher but its nice to come home and do some yoga just for me, this dvd is great for that.",1363478400,2,621,4.504424778761062
2769248,5,B000NIVNKU,"I'm fairly new to yoga and very new to ashtanga yoga. I know the practices are rather long (1.5 hours or more), and often that's hard for me to do at home with a toddler. I wanted to try ashtanga though. I like how this DVD has sections discussing breathing methods, history and more. And then there's a workout that, with shavasana, is about 1 hour 10 minutes long. It's pretty challenging, but I enjoy the challenge. I feel that Kino MacGregor does a great job of discussing how to do the poses correctly and offers variations for those who aren't as advanced. One pose that worries me a bit is should stand. I have heard this one can be dangerous if not done correctly because of pressure on the neck. She does discuss safety and proper form, but only well after moving very quickly into the posture, which is a little late. Of course, after doing the workout at least once, you've heard the explanations before. Another yoga instructor's DVD that I have helps students enter into shoulder stand slowly and with care. Other than that, I think it's a great DVD. It's informative and challenging, and allows students to do a slightly shorter version of ashtanga. Ashtanga is certainly a lot deeper than asana, but I think that often people enter into the lifestyle a step at a time and perhaps 6x week 1.5 hour practices are a bit much, so this is a nice starting point.",1361577600,3,1371,4.51004016064257
2769249,5,B000NIVNKU,"This dvd is an excellent resource for new ashtanga practitioners. It's divided into several sections - Yoga philosophy (short introduction), Suggestions for practice,  comprehensive introduction to breathing and a great beginning practice of half primary. The practice has Kino doing the full form and Greg doing modifications. This will not replace a teacher and is not designed to do so. But it is a great way to get started and for those that feel they need a led class, this would be excellent to practice with at home, in between working with a teacher.",1351123200,2,558,4.9361702127659575
8178097,2,B000NIVNKU,Maybe it's just me but I think this guy is creepy!! I can't even make it through the whole thing. He just creeps me out!!,1481587200,,121,3.88
8178098,5,B000NIVNKU,"I've been doing yoga with this DVD for more than 6 months now. What I like is the pace, with enough time spent on each pose along with detailed instructions. This is more like an intermediate level of yoga, with sufficient challenge and reward for each pose. I've gained muscle strength and have noticed readjustment of body weight and a better posture, not to mention more flexibility and above all, a better focus on the days that I do the yoga (a few times per week). Strongly recommend this DVD.",1462060800,,499,4.555555555555555
8178099,5,B000NIVNKU,I like this vid,1461369600,,15,3.0
8178100,5,B000NIVNKU,Kino is a superb instructor. This was a wonderful introduction DVD. It had been a few years since I'd last practiced Ashtanga and wanted a 'refresher' DVD. This did the job!,1454630400,,173,4.612903225806452
8178101,5,B000NIVNKU,perfect!  easy to follow with good descriptions,1452384000,,47,5.714285714285714
8178102,1,B000NIVNKU,I'm a beginner to yoga and this was way to advanced for me. I found it difficult to follow due to the speed at which she goes through the poses and lack of explanation of proper positioning into poses.,1449014400,,201,4.17948717948718
8178103,5,B000NIVNKU,"Very good, even though some poses are beyond my flexibility.",1408320000,,60,5.1
8178104,3,B000NIVNKU,I have gone to one of Kino's workshop and it was amazing!!!! She really is a kick-ass (excuse my language) teacher. But her first DVD's I am not a bit fan of.,1405468800,,158,3.96875
8178105,2,B000NIVNKU,"Although the section on breathing was informative and useful, the actual practice was way too fast for me to follow.  I felt that there was not enough time spent on proper position/alignment.  I have taken yoga classes before and my experience has always been positive and invigorating with relaxing and flowing movements.  The title of the DVD as an ""Introduction"" is misleading  and I would not recommend this for any beginner in the practice of yoga.",1390953600,4,453,4.921052631578948
8178106,5,B000NIVNKU,"This video is giving me an introduction to Ashtanga within my own home, before I get up the guts to go to a class and be under the guidance of a teacher. I love how the video can be broken down into smaller segments so you can focus on a particular area. Richard's advice and tips are very detailed oriented and remind me what to focus on within each pose. I can already feel my progress after a month of continued use. No, I haven't done it every day, but I have done it at least 5 days a week since before Christmas. Since then my heels are almost touching the floor in Downward Dog and I can finally fold with mostly straight legs in Forward Fold. For me, these are big accomplishments in my practice and I attribute my success to this video.",1390780800,6,745,4.180555555555555
