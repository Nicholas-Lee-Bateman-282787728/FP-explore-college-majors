8559090,4,B00AY6FU8C,"A great actor finally gets his due in this look at the career of the iconic Christopher Lee, whose performance in 1958's ':Horror of Dracula"": from Hammer Films remains the definitive portrayal of Bram Stoker's vampire.. It took a lifetime of great performances (in sometimes less-than-brilliant films) for Lee to achieve worldwide recognition. This was made possible by his portrayals of the evil wizard, Saruman, in director Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and Count Dooku in George Lucas'  ""Star Wars"" epic Along the way, he thrilled filmgoers with his portrayals in such diverse releases as ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" (as James Bond villain, Scaramanga), ,Richard Lester's ""The Three and Four Musketeers"" (as Rochefort), Billy Wilder's ""The Private Life of Sherlock Homes,"" and the cult classic, Robin Hardy's  ""The Wicker Man,"" which also starred Edward Woodward. Lee frequently co-starred with Peter Cushing. Their first film together was ""The Curse of Frankenstein,"" which started the British horror industry. Other icons of the fright film genre he worked with include Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Michael Gough, John Carradine and Ingrid Pitt. He is the only actor to play three characters in stories about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Great Detective, including Sherlock Holmes, Mycroft Holmes and Sir Henry Baskerville. One of the few British actors capable of doing an American .accent, Lee played a gunsmith in the Western, ""Hannie Caulder,"" with Racquel Welch, Robert Culp, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Elam and Strother Martin. Filmed at a gathering of film fans, this video has sound problems, but not so annoying as to ruin the experience of listening to his anecdotes about his remarkable career.",1519257600,,1727,5.299270072992701

Amazing Documentary about a fantastic actor : Christopher Lee.

He Played Dracula, Saruman and Count Dooku !

So,Yes- This was filmed a few years back,But  it is updated with recent pics and any footage of Mr. Lee is most welcome.

To watch Chris Lee answer questions from moderators and fans so patiently is something to behold.

Lee pauses between answers and his expressions of his memories need no words to explain the emotions that flood back to him, Such a treat to see the man without  a script.

Lee discusses his friendship with Peter Cushing through out their lives and careers,The two were almost blood twins in the way they interacted with wives accepting the unrivaled chemistry.

Some readers may recall Vincent Price (MJ Thriller MV) and Christopher made a few films with him too and they took those occasions to share lives off screen about simpler things.

The movie trailers are included to quite a few of his films.

He recalls not being proud of all his films and lack of control,But maintains over 200 films and acting over 60 years and the odds involved.",1399852800,6,1104,4.757894736842105
