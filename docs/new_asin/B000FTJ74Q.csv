2585699,3,B000FTJ74Q,"""Adam and Steve"" is the cinematic equivalent of a beach read. Entertaining throughout, a little off-color in spots  but not terribly risqu. Amusing. Craig Chester really seems to be trying just a bit too hard here as director and star, and the humor is often strained, often sophomoric, and some of the gags just get overworked, but it's a bedroom farce so that's almost to be expected. The actors, to a person, are all engaging although, sadly, there's really little screen chemsitry between the principals, which is a shame because, taken individually, their performances, as I mentioned, are all engaging. It's good, however, to see gay actors playing gay roles for a change. It's not ""great art,"" and breaks no new ground, but it's a nice, easy fluff piece.  I, persoanlly, would not add it to my own library  because, for me, it doesn't merit more than one or two viewings. Rent this one first.",1157932800,3,899,4.787096774193548
2585700,5,B000FTJ74Q,"I was inchanted w/ this film from the very begining. when craig and parker go to danceteria dressed in goth clad thinking it's goth night and being annoyed by the hipsters.

  the deleted scene w/ Jackie Beat and Mario Diaz (dirty sanchez) is worth the buy alone.

  Under all the humour and romance there is a very modern political message that is apparent to gay or straight people. I love this film...5 stars. Finally a gay film I can relate to.",1157328000,4,448,4.469135802469136
2585701,5,B000FTJ74Q,"Okay, I'm a sap for a romantic comedy; I like a happy ending, so sue me.  This movie is funny and sweet, well acted, and has great production values.  The characters are very endearing and seem like real, everyday kind of guys.  The second time I watched it was even better because there was much I missed or didn't appreciate the first time.  Definitely worth buying and watching over and over.",1156377600,29,395,4.52112676056338
2585702,4,B000FTJ74Q,"As the other reviews point out, this film is ""uneven,"" BUT, well worth the watching.  I'm at odds with the reviewer who found the film ""...hysterical and funny..."", but not ""...deep, touching, sensitive and moving.""  I found it to be VERY touching, sensitive and moving.  Both lead characters played their roles so convincingly that I would not have been surprised to learn that they were ""boyfriends"" in real life.  Yes, ""Get Real"" and ""Beautiful Thing"" are ""classics,"" but there's a place for these gay romantic comedies, as well.  When you're of a certain age, gay coming-of-age flicks can get a tad ""old.""  It's nice to have some fairly decent stories with gay characters older than 18.",1155513600,5,690,4.905172413793103
2585703,5,B000FTJ74Q,"Don't want to create a war from the previous reviewer, but after watching this fun flick last night, I have to throw my 2 cents in.  If you are looking for a deep, touching, sensitive and moving film then don't bother with this one (the cover art clearly shows you what to expect).  Also if you're the kind of person who doesn't appreciate the beauty of a dirty joke, then move on to something else.  Now if you are looking for something different, hysterical, and funny, then BUY THIS NOW!  We (myself and 6 friends) watched this last night and we were laughing so hard we were crying.  In fact, we had to pause it several times as we couldn't control our laughter as we were missing the continuing dialogue.  And I think that's what this film is all about.........to be fun and entertaining.  I don't think the writers/producers/directors/actors had high hopes of an Oscar.  And too clarify my rebuttal in my title......""America did prove to be British in approach""...... these artists took comedy ala Benny Hill and but a gay twist to it.",1155427200,4,1041,4.619565217391305
2585704,1,B000FTJ74Q,"Curious.  How can the previous reviewer write a critique of the film and point out the negativity of it and still give four stars.  The film was shown in May, 2005 at The Seattle Film Festival.  The audience seemed to enjoy the picture immensely; 650 people were turned away from The Eqyptian Theatre on that hot Saturday afternoon. In ""rerunning"" the film one tends to believe the two leads were over-confident; the plot was hum-drum, unbelievable and somewhat trite.  Discussions with others bears this same trend.  A plot for another film of this genre might concern a film producer in his early 30's becoming overly impressed with his success to the point of no longer corresponding with his dad. Remember, boys and girls, ""no good deed goes unpunished.""  Not ""sour grapes,"" as in vino veritas, but a fact!

The two leads in""ADAM AND STEVE"" are too confident. The plot by the writer/director is trite, unlikely and boring. Cameos by some stars, including one time Academy Award nominee Sally Kirkland, do add a bit of glamour and camp to the obviously threadbare  budget. This movie compared to Sundance Film Festival winner of 1999, the British import, ""GET REAL,"" starring Ben Silverstone and Brad Gorton is apples and oranges. ""GET REAL"" has class, polish, skillful acting and handsome looking leads.  Talent? YES! Why can't American filmmakers look to their English cousins for the secret of making such films.  Inspiration?  Try watching either ""GET REAL"" or ""BEAUTIFUL THING."" Save your money for ""ADAM AND STEVE"" and purchase these two cogent and enjoyable British lifestyles from two distinct class structures of Great Britain's society. Attn: Mr Craig Chester---",1155340800,8,1675,5.076642335766423
2585705,4,B000FTJ74Q,"ADAM AND STEVE is a movie you want to succeed: the idea of an honest gay relationship developing between two guys with a weird history and subsequent difficulties forming meaningful intimacy, the presence of four fine actors, and a film that seems to take itself not too seriously.  The problem is that writer/director/star Craig Chester just seems to have put too much into his bag for one film and in doing so he diluted the strength it could have had.

Adam (Craig Chester) first met Steve (Malcolm Gets) in a dance bar in 1987 where Adam (accompanied by his grossly obese friend Rhonda - Parker Posey in a fat suit) is dazzled by Steve's good looks and on a bet from Rhonda ends up on the date from hell: after snorting coke cut with baby laxative the two men become amorous with some rather embarrassing consequences.  17 years later Adam is a bird watcher guide while his friend Rhonda, now without a single pound of fat, is a sadly unsuccessful standup comic. Adam inadvertently injures his beloved dog and in trying to get help at a human hospital encounters psychiatrist Steve and the two begin a courtship.

Neither man is able to cope with the idea of monogamous intimacy yet they develop a solid relationship, despite visits with dysfunctional families (Adam's Jewish family are ridiculously accident prone while Steve's Texas redneck parents are coldly homophobic).  Steve has a straight roommate Michael (Chris Kattan) who plays into Steve's life the way Rhonda plays into Adam's life.  Eventually memory recovers the past, it is dealt with and the ending is very predictable - as well as bit sappy.

Each of the main characters does a fine job with their respective roles.  It is the sidebar diversions that mess up the storyline rather than enhancing it.  Yes, much of the nonsense can be forgiven because the film's heart is in the right place, but why this talented group could not have inserted a little restraint here and there is a frustrating question with which we are left. It is an entertaining film that errs on over the top asides to the point of distraction.  Grady Harp, August 06",1155168000,31,2109,4.7534246575342465
2585706,4,B000FTJ74Q,"Craig Chester and Malcolm Gets (particularly this latter hunk, who's just so winsomely huggable---he seems so right at home, so comfortable with himself) have some real warm moments, and that doesn't often happen in gay-themed films these days. Unfortunately the pluses of this are more than a few times imbalanced by some of the following minuses:

-An overage of what other review sites have called ""gross-out"" humor. I really could have stood the diarrhea sight-gag, had its use not been overloaded by the sometimes diarrhetic mouth of a stand-up club's master of ceremonies (Michael Panes, was it?) and of Parker Posey's character, herself, upon occasion. Why are such remarks, like the female-bestiality cracks in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" considered such fair game in humor these days? Puke!!

-Perhaps a little over-reliance on Jewish ""sensibility-moments.""

-Guess, overall, I just feel that Chester has been around long enough to: know better, turn out something better, just plain old be better. It can't have been inexpensive to roll out this product, so it just seems he could'a gotten a lot more for his buck (and we for ours).

WHOA.....WHOA......WHOA.........STOPPpppp! You know what? I went back and ""re-looked"" this movie last night, and in the midst of my millionth laugh, it suddenly hit me that I hadn't really laughed any less the first night. Say, maybe I've been trying to make something too serious out of this little production, and that's not what it's about at all. It really doesn't have to be another ""Brokeback Mountain"" (as great as that was). Isn't it nice, instead, to have something that keeps our spirits up? Well, you bet.

And we can have all the ""sensibility-moments"" they can throw at us......cause isn't there a good, old Hebrew word that just perfectly describes Adam?  Isn't it something like........Klutz (and a lovable one at that)?  And being ""sad-sacky,"" that can be funny too, can't it? Right on!

Finally, on an even more positive note (for someone like me who's always placing gay kissing scenes*** under the old microscope), I'd have to judge that this production has not been afraid to give us a goodly number of 'osculating-lips-in-action' shots. Don't you agree? They weren't all perfectly aimed, but there were some really good ones.

PS--So, congratulations Adam & Steve, on your wedding, and for being able to live in a world far removed from that of Jack & Ennis.

***And for scenes in which ""lip-locks"" were done as well or better, try these: ""Just A Question Of Love"" / ""Latter Days"" / ""All Over The Guy"" / ""Brokeback Mountain"" / ""Maurice"" / sorry, gotta stop somewhere)",1154908800,5,2628,4.993135011441647

Touch is love
Love is reaching
Reaching is love

No one could sum up this film better than this nearly final music. But the film is going a long way beyond the simple words in these four lines and two verses. It is not enough to just touch the other and be touched by the other. We must understand that touching is a very complex activity. You have to touch the mind of the other and vice versa be touched by the mind of the other and in the same way your mind is supposed to touched the other and the other is supposed to touch your mind. But speaking of the mind, everything must be included and sorted out not in any way to judge or try what is good or bad but just to know who the other is and vice versa and to accept the other the way he is and to be accepted by the other the way you are. And that's what is meant by reaching.

Straight sex erases this dual relation since one is a man and one is a woman and everything is reduced to that difference, but when the two persons are two men, or two women, the differences are so much deeper and more secret, less visible and more complicated. They cannot be reduced to a simple difference in sex since the two people are of the same sex. The differences are mental, intellectual, artistic, physical and of course the past of the people is different, their heritage is different and so many other things are different, but not the sex and nothing can be reduced to that circumstantial difference. It is so easy to forget all these things in a straight couple, to reduce the whole thing to a simple difference in sex. Actually the sex difference, or similitude, itself is the least important element in a love relation that can be even just as strong and yet not lead to sex. Love does not have to be realized in sex though sex should be a continuation of love, which it is not all the time.

This film is touching at that level, emotionally strong and it really takes a whole village to bring two people together against all the odds that accumulate against them, especially when the two people are of the same sex. And when you live in East Village, New York, it takes the whole neighbourhood to do it and doing it changes the whole neighbourhood.

That gives a tremendous density to this two human roads crossing and the two travellers coming together and little by little settling together. The story is complex and at the end we sure know there is no Bernstein curse of any sort, just a pile of unluckily coincidences that can be ended when you deeply believe that there is no curse on you.

To conclude let me say that bringing together a Jewish birdwatcher from New York and a Christian psychiatrist from Texas is not that obvious, and we have to keep in mind that ""the end is in the beginning and yet you go on"" as Samuel Beckett said and he knew all the details of the curse of being different in a world that accepts only absolute uniformity and homogeneity.

2585795,5,B000FTJ74Q,"I had seen this film edited on Logo, but had no idea how much more funny it would be unedited, as it should be by law, and on a large screen.  Sure, it is a weird, somewhat disgusting, and quirky film with silly dialogue, but it really works.  It does have a seriously romantic moment at the end that does make one want to cry.  The extra of how this film came to be is very interesting with interviews of the cast.

The choreography is superb, and the melodramatic humour is very fitting and good for what it is.  There is also an included lesson from the choreographer of the dance number.  No, I didn't attempt it because I find line dancing tedious to learn, but its fun to watch, and makes one feel good.

This film had great potential but unfortunately went for cheap laughs and a disgusting gross-out factor at the beginning of the film which kind of spoiled the mood and high hopes I had for a lighthearted romantic comedy.

The acting was just as mediocre as the cheap laughs, but at times I fully believed their characters.

But truth be told, the grotesque is for both couples in the movie, the gay and the hetero, so maybe it's only my impression.

Anyway, it's definitely one of the few gay romance comedy with a good and full happily ever after, and it's also funny, so, for once, you can see a gay themed movie without having to deal with all the usual angst.",1278288000,,548,4.074074074074074

Some of them are the country-western line-dance number stepped to the hilarious song ""S--t Happens; Adam's lover Steve's singing from ""The Sound of Music"" of ""Something Good""; the title itself, which takes the oft-quoted statement from the religious right, that God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, and turns it on its head, for example; the wedding scene for all its hokiness is quite moving.

On the other hand, parts of the movie are way over the top-- the diarrhea scene is disgusting, much of Rhonda's (Parkey Posey) stand-up comedy routine is boring, and Chris Kattan as Steve's straight roommate is miscast.

""Adam & Steve"" is certainly not up to the quality of ""Brokeback Mountain"" but is better than a dozen low-budget gay-themed movies, whatever that means, the names of which I have long since forgotten.",1206921600,3,1156,4.984455958549223

2585855,5,B000FTJ74Q,"My favorite movie of 2006!  I saw it missing at the video store and had no idea what it was about.  Finally a copy was in and I rented it- I bought it the next day.

I remember the 80's dancers and when coke was the popular drug, and bowl movements ARE topics of conversations in my life.  I took the campy, offensive jokes as campy jokes.  It could offend sensative people.  I liked the story.

I shared it with my friends and we laughed and laughed talking about the over the top scenes- she actually had some guy crap in the corner of her house after doing too much something!  She in turn shared it with more friends who did not like it.  They are a gay couple and didn't find it funny.

Be sensative to stereotypes because this movie isn't.  It IS well writen, well danced, and I enjoyed every minute (especially Courtney Love's song ""Love Love Love"" and montage that went with it).  I really did laugh out loud at one scene (the dance off) and tear up at the next (street argument).  ""I'm 30... of course I'm damaged goods.  But I'm goods none the less!""",1174694400,3,1060,4.261306532663316
2585856,5,B000FTJ74Q,I thought Adam and Steve was a great romantic comedy. I wasn't disappointed at all throughout the movie. The ending was my favorite. I'm a sucker for a happy ending.,1173398400,3,165,4.533333333333333
2585857,3,B000FTJ74Q,"Directing, writing and playing one of the title characters, Craig Chester attempts to pull a Streisand triple play with this low-budget 2005 film, but his strenuous multi-tasking results in an unwieldy combination of character-driven romantic comedy and flat-out farce that doesn't quite satisfy the requirements of either genre. For the most part, Chester seems to be making a gay version of ""When Harry Met Sally"" starting with a flashback to 1987 when Adam, a self-loathing goth accompanied by his overweight and equally morose friend Rhonda, meets Steve, a glam-rock dancer on disco night at a trendy Manhattan club. A night of cocaine laced with baby laxative leads to an unfortunate episode which has to be seen to be believed. Sparks fly when they accidentally meet each other again many years later not knowing who the other is.

It's refreshing to see a gay movie that frees itself from more serious concerns like rights violations and persecution, but the film is ultimately done in by Chester's reliance on standard rom-com clich&eacute;s and a wildly fluctuating tone, including an over-the-top finale that hinges on a country-style dance-off. Chester and Malcolm Gets are engaging if a bit bland in the lead roles. Perhaps because he has played so many sexually ambiguous characters on ""Saturday Night Live"", Chris Kattan is oddly stilted as Steve's straight roommate, while Parker Posey easily steals the picture as Rhonda, now skinny and a stand-up comic, with her natural sassiness and deft comedy timing. Several familiar faces show up in extended cameos - Paul Sand and Julie Hagerty as Adam's jinxed parents, Melinda Dillon as Steve's corn-belt mother and Sally Kirkland as an enthusiastic drug counselor. There are a surprising number of extras on the 2006 DVD - a solid commentary track from Chester and Gets, a making-of featurette, some deleted scenes, a gag reel and even a dance lesson to replicate the strutting moves in the finale. But see it for Posey's quirky charms.",1172016000,5,1996,5.122699386503068
2585858,3,B000FTJ74Q,"Adam & Steve tells the tale of the titular characters who met back in the 80's one night only to have the night end horribly for different reasons (sheesh, one of the nastiest / funny scenes that I've seen on film). In recent times, they meet again - not knowing who each other is - and fall in love. Of course, we get our climax Steve realizes who the Adam is, and because of the night back in the 80's becomes ultimately embarassed (sheesh again, rightfully so) and tries to deny his love for Adam.

 The film is one of those filled with quirks and giggles that you will either adore or forget about 15 minutes after viewing (and talking about that one scene, sheesh). I'm in the middle. I did adore the scene for it's positive view on love and for Parker Posey (I don't care what she's in, I adore her), but I'm not crazy about the film. I did enjoy the dance competition number. It was random and felt placed in there, but it was still great.

2585859,1,B000FTJ74Q,"My friend and I rented this movie because the synopsis on tla releasing looked entertaining.  However, she and my roommate and I were severely disappointed by the end.  Despite that I really WANTED to like this movie, seeing as I like Chris Kattan and love Parker Posey, I regretted my chioce afterwards.  I think Craig Chester made a valiant effort, but it didn't work out as well as I think it could have.  For example, it's not remotely funny that Parker Posey's character continues to tell fat jokes about herself when she is no longer fat.  There are parts of the plot where it didn't seem to be going anywhere.  The situation with Adam's family was unbelieveable and the conversation in the apt. between Posey's and Kattan's character made no sense to me.  It felt as if the dialogue was trying too hard to be funny and none of it was.  The only reason we laughed was because of how painful it was to watch the movie, especially after the gross cocaine scene.  I really would not recommend this movie if you're looking for a funny gay romantic comedy.",1168646400,4,1057,4.550264550264551

We couldn't wait for the DVD to come out!  When we recived it we watched it the day it came and we laughed so hard our sides hurt.  Yes there were a lot of ""type casting"" but if you think about it most people can think of people they know who fit each and every one of them.  I think it is one of the best ""Gay Movies"" I have seen it a long, long time.",1167782400,,549,3.831858407079646
2585874,4,B000FTJ74Q,"Finally, a gay film in which the lead roles are played by gay actors! Neither of the actors try too hard, which makes all the difference in the scenes where they're sexual. Contrast this with ""Eden"", a marvellous film yet with awkward sex scenes.

Where the film started to unravel for me was how the four main characters were portrayed - in broad brushstrokes, each a stereotype which is all too familiar. Adam - a Jewish nerd with a bad self-image; Steve - a shrink with control issues which he can't/won't resolve; Rhonda - a bad stand-up comic with food/sex issues; Michael - a sloppy straight man who can't filter his thoughts. The premise seems to be that opposites attract, and that all's well that ends well.

Adam's parents and sister are way over the top sufferers, yet accepting their bad luck with equanimity (Julie Hagerty is worth watching in a ridiculous neck brace!). Steve's parents are Texan Christians who never will accept him, yet show up for a visit in New York and also at the end of the film. The message - Jews are liberal lefties, Christians are rigid rabid conservatives...

At the end the two main characters get married - legally I presume - in the state of New York in a sort of New Age/Jewish ritual. The two subsidiary characters also end up together. The only character who ends up moving in a positive direction is Craig Chester's Adam, who at one point says in effect that though he's damaged goods, he expects to be accepted as he is. However, he is the stereotypical Jewish sexless nerd, out of touch with his body and afraid to assert himself. At the end of the film, Malcolm Gets' Steve still has ""clean-o-mania"" and still expresses shame over his need to excrete (after a horrible incident at the start of the film). Similarly, Parker Posey's Rhonda equates appetite for food and sex, and expects that her gender entitles her to power over other men. Chris Kattan's Michael is a straight slob who never learned the social skill of filtering his thoughts before starting to speak to someone.

Chester and Gets interact naturally throughout; Posey and Kattan are a bit under-utilised as their characters are rather static. The choreography, costumes and lighting are excellent. The dialogue of reminds me of ""Will and Grace"" except that this film did move on a bit faster than the series did!",1166745600,2,2330,4.717444717444717
2585875,4,B000FTJ74Q,"Funny. Sometimes a little ackward. The leading actors are not ""the"" gorgeous type, but are charming and have good acting as well as the others. I think it worths owing it to see every now and then.",1166486400,2,197,4.351351351351352
2585876,4,B000FTJ74Q,"Okay, if you're looking for drama (instead of slapstick) or you're looking for realism, look elsewhere.  This is pure silliness and fun.  Who cares if it isn't the most sober and accurate portrayal of gay relationships (or straight ones.) This is fun!

I laughed so hard, actually, that I woke up one of my kids in the next room.  More than once.  It has a few slower moments, but overall it's very fun and very sweet and gives you a bit of romantic escapism that I see too infrequently.

The actors and actresses here are all good for this film and the material, and don't take themselves too seriously, just like the film.  The highlight is the dance-off toward the end.  I watched it a few times.  I will watch it more.

Some people rightfully feel there should have been some additional editing done and maybe a few gags and a few silly moments removed.  Generally, I agree, but the whole package is good and entertaining and great fun.  The two-stepping alone makes this worth the price for me.  Enjoy!",1166486400,2,1007,4.527777777777778

seeing it but then i saw it at blockbuster so i decided to rent it and i'm

so glad i did because i absolutly loved it. i haven't seen a movie like this in a long time, malcolm gets was great as steve, i've seen him in

caroline in the city and i thought he was funny but he was amazing in this. i've seen parker posey in alot of movies but she was really good in

this and chris kattan wasn't bad either. i never seen craig chester before

but he's an amazing actor and a wonderful writer and director, i never laughed so much in my life except when i saw another gay movie.

i think every one should see this movie, my favorite part is when steve

sings to adam it was so beautiful and i didn't know that malcolm knew how

to sing he's amazing, they should have had him sing on caroline in the city it would have been an even better show if they had. i can't wait to

2585880,3,B000FTJ74Q,"It's the funny story of two gay men whose original encounter goes spectacularly awry thanks to a near-lethal combination of laxative and cocaine.  After 17 years, they meet again; both having well evolved and moved on from their disco days, with the disaster from the past locked away in each one's memories.  What's good about this story is that you could have cast women in the leads or a man and a woman, with the end result being just as funny, just as enjoyable.  As it is, this boy meets boy, boy loses boy, boy regains boy story is delightful.

While not one of the title characters, Parker Posey gives the most memorable performance as a once fat comedian that hasn't found a way to adapt her humor to her now trim appearance.  She is a delight, capable of carrying almost any movie.  So why don't we see her more often?  Please... please... bring on more Parker!

The early scenes are a little laborious, but once the story gets past the disco era it becomes a lot more interesting.  The highlight is a wildly entertaining dance-off in a gay cowboy club.  It's well danced, well choreographed and laugh out loud funny.

I might have given Adam and Steve four stars, but for about 30 seconds of one of the early scenes that could have been a little more subtle.",1162339200,3,1269,4.497816593886463

It wasn't a stand out in the genre, but it had all the elements it should have had; a great lead cast, clever and funny writing, and most importantly, a good story.  Where it lacked, and lacked badly, is in the supporting cast.  Chris Kattan and Parker Posey were the weak links in both acting and story line, and in my opinion cost the movie a 5th star.

The story around Adam and Steve was very well done and I enjoyed the casting.  [Who knew Malcolm Gets had that body??].  It was a delightful movie night for my hubby and I.  We're both suckers for a sappy, happy ending, and this movie delivered.",1160438400,5,633,4.26890756302521

It starts out along the lines of a John Waters film but the crude bathroom humor is so disgusting that  many viewers may not be able to continue with it. Many of the gay bashing jokes fall flat and Parker Posey is wasted here and her character (a really bad stand-up comic) is painful to watch. On the other hand, half of the film is very enjoyable. It finally gets on track in the second half, but by that time it is just too late to make ammends. The two lead actors are good and most of the supporting actors are great - Sally Kirkland is very funny in a cameo and the ""family"" scenes are pretty funny.
