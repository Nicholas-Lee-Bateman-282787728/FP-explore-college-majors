7800713,4,1629971928,"If you're invested in a trip to Rome, Florence or Venice, then I recommend you invest a little more to take this course by Prof. Kenneth R. Bartlett.  This is an in-depth treatment that consist of 36 lectures that focus mainly on the cities I listed.  Each of the 36 lectures is about 30 minutes in length and you learn not only the history of the area,s but about their architecture, art and sculptures, myths, legends, tourist areas and even secret doors to get you more easily from one place to another.  At times, the information became overwhelming  but since its easy to watch sections over or consult the guidebook - that wasn't a problem. I loved having this private tour.  When he says, Now its time to climb that hill  you do climb it via video after having a birds eye view of it to get your bearings.  His lectures are from a room but the camera then takes you to the actual places. There are even travel tips by the Smithsonian thrown in for good measure.  Ive been to these cites already, but having viewed / listened to these lectures, I learned so much more about what I had seen  and Im ready to go back again!

As another viewer mentioned, you don't get the free streaming that you would get it you purchased this course through the Great Courses so it cant be viewed on a smart tablet or phone.  I don't think they made that clear as you read the description of this course. For this reason, I too deducted one star from this purchase. This course was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope you found this review helpful.",1463529600,2,1586,4.397260273972603
7800714,5,1629971928,"I am so happy with my purchase.  I have been a ""student"" of the Great Courses for years now and have purchased both the DVDs and CDs as well as the Audible versions, and I can honestly say the amount of information they manage to cram into each course is impressive.  I have yet to complete a lecture underwhelmed and this course is no different. It allows for the history of an entire civilization from the Etruscans up and also gives present day advice on the best day trips and eating locations to name a couple.  I like the way this DVD was formatted, as it doesnt feel like an infomercial for Italy, it really feels like several courses with beautiful architecture, scenery, and artwork highlighting the knowledgable professors' lesson throughout.

7800715,5,1629971928,"I gave this course as a gift to a good friend (adult) who recently traveled to Italy.  It made a fantastic gift after her trip (rather than before) because her being there piqued her interest to learn more since she had prior, personal knowledge.  The lectures are thorough and fast-paced (in a good way), she reports.  Each lecture goes for just the right amount of time (about half an hour), so the information is easy to digest.  She is very happy, as am I.  I received this course at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",1461542400,,532,4.443298969072165
7800716,4,1629971928,"6 DVDs are accompanied by a course guidebook. Despite this, the guidebook isn't large and can be carried. For the DVDs, each disc has 6 lectures, combining to a total of 36 lectures. Those 36 lectures are 30 minutes each which totals up to 18 hours (I hope my math is right.) I am impressed on how you can compress that heft into a small case and guide book which means you can carry these on the go. For the content, it is more of a history course that is focused on the traveler so there are certain topics that won't apply for this course (like politics, warfare, etc.) It also focuses on the more famous areas of Italy (like Rome, Florence, Venice, etc.) so there are areas that will be somewhat left out.

For the professor who conducts this product, he seems well-known (he has a Wikipedia page!!! You know you're famous in some way if you have your own page on Wikipedia haha) He even seems to have decent reviews on online review sites (ex. ratemyprofessor.com) While some have criticized him for speaking too fast on his lectures, you can simply rewind back with your DVD player if he seems to be going too fast.
