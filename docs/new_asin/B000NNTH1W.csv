8179379,2,B000NNTH1W,"Proved useless.  There was no narration.  The behaviors illustrated are just about survival and such.  Not interesting.  And very boring pace.  Also, it's very old school animal psychology.  I only bought because it's hard to find rat behavior on video.  At least, one could say it's objective and clear and simple.  Sigh.",1486512000,,322,5.0576923076923075
8179380,4,B000NNTH1W,the footage is very grainy and the sound is disturbingly like film of the 1940's but it show the same great experiments we all learned about.  good for kids these days to see!,1380844800,,175,4.303030303030303
