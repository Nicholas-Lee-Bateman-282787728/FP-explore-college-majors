4486506,4,B004WGLL2O,"Worth it if you are a G&D fan, or want more information on it.  It's put together from fairly crude films, and has unusual narration. The narrator sounds like he's clicking his tongue after every sentence--don't know if that's him or the audio quality.  These things can be put aside though for the excellent layout of John Allen.",1350000000,,330,4.672413793103448

8445074,5,B004WGLL2O,"This is a rare opportunity to watch John Allen's famous Gorre & Daphetid model railroad in operation! Allen was a pro photographer who used his artistic skill to create what may have been the finest home layout ever built. His secret was the key use of strategically placed mirrors to make the space he had available appear even larger. Unfortunately, the layout was destroyed when Allen's home caught fire and burned down days after the master craftsman's death. But, thanks to this wonderful video, The Gorre & Daphetid lives again! This is a must-have for any serious model railroader or fan of the hobby!",1486598400,,608,4.855769230769231
