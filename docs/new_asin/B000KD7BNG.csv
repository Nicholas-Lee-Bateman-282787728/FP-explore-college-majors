8155682,5,B000KD7BNG,"Nothing is out of bounds with this guy. Nothing. Stanhope is a genius on par with Lenny Bruce and Charles Bukowski. So be ready for some wild stuff, especially with Word of Mouth. The ending parts of Word of Mouth are off the charts shameless. Stanhope's other DVDs are great, too.",1378252800,,281,4.529411764705882
8155683,5,B000KD7BNG,I love Doug Stanhope and this is a great DVD.  I have seen him live about 5 times and this live DVD is true to life.,1358035200,,116,3.4615384615384617
8155684,4,B000KD7BNG,"If you like Doug Stanhope, definitely check this one out. It's not as good as some of his other material, but it's something any Stanhope fan should have.",1266105600,,154,4.535714285714286
8155685,5,B000KD7BNG,"If you like your comedians confrontational, violent, controversial, smart and brutally honest, you have found your guy. Doug Stanhope is a harbinger of hate hellbent on making you question most of what your fed in your typical day. Sensitive to topics such as drug, abortions, and pornography, then feel free to look up Bill Cosby or someone who won't make you too bad about laughing at an STD joke. Stanhope is as raw as it gets and makes Jim Norton look like a child. What's so amazing is how drunk he can be while still maintaining his bit. Rampaging segways galore so don't multitask while watching the DVD. By the way, if you like it graphic, just know that all of the standup is leading up to the final bit... you've been warned.",1240617600,4,735,4.533834586466165
8155686,5,B000KD7BNG,"Whats better than watching your favorite comedian? Not much when your favorite comedian is Doug Stanhope. and with a set list that includes 'Tax Jesus, Pro Abortion,Flipper Baby, Transvestie Hooker' who couldn't be happy? I enjoyed the hell out of this DVD and you should too and if you don't then your not funny",1225670400,5,312,4.796296296296297
8155687,4,B000KD7BNG,"If you wanna know what it's like to see Stanhope live, this is the DVD to have. The sound and video quality aren't great at times, but this is a perfect snapshot of his actual live show. If you're new to Stanhope, I wouldn't start here, I'd suggest the most recent Showtime special he did. After you're familiar with him, definitely check this one out.",1210464000,6,352,4.430769230769231
