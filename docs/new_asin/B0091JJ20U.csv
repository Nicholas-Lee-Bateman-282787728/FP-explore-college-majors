5241902,5,B0091JJ20U,"I just received this dvd and and it is a great find!  Rare footage of Ike and Tina on stage and behind the scenes, traveling on the road, in the studio, and at home.  Some may complain about the quality of the footage which goes from black and white to color, from A- to B/B-.

 I love this dvd, for it shows the inner workings of a husband and wife duo in their rare off stage moments.  This is the kind of stuff that I really like to obtain.  This is the rarest footage that I have ever seen of Ike and Tina, so if you are a fan, get this video!",1358812800,,547,3.8392857142857144
5241903,4,B0091JJ20U,"IKE & TINA: ON THE ROAD 1971-72 is basically a home movie filmed with a portable video camera, which was high tech at the time -- but sub-par by today's standards, of the dynamic duo of Ike and Tina Turner, their band The Kings Of Rhythm, and their backing vocals and opening act, The Ikettes as they toured in 1971-72.

What makes this film different from your average everyday amateur home movie is that it was filmed by famed rock photojournalist Bob Gruen and his then wife, Nadya Beck. Gruen's pictures have captured everyone from the Turners to John Lennon and have become iconic in rock and roll history.

In this film, he and Nadya actually become part of the Turner's entourage filming them not only on and back stage, rehearsals and on the road, but also their home life and in the recording studio. The movie captures the excitement that the Ike & Tina Turner Revue had on stage, and it also shows the artistic process of them recording tracks. You also get to watch the band mates clowning around and you get to see the later incarnation of the Ikettes. Unfortunately, those people in the film aren't identified so you don't know who they are.

According to an interview in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Tina-My-Life-Story-icon-t/dp/0061958808/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Tina: My Life Story (icon! t)</a>, Gruen says that they filmed about 50-hours of footage during this time. Here, that 50-hours is whittled down to 81-minutes of pure entertainment.

Interestingly enough, I'm reading the above book and in this DVD you get to see some of the players that were behind-the-scenes like Rhonda Grahm who was the business manager and Ann Thomas who was part of the Ikettes (although in non-singing form according to the book) and Ike's mistress. I think it even shows Thomas's daughter she had with Ike because the film shows the kids at home and there's one young girl in it, which made me wonder who it was since the Turners only had sons.

Anyway, the footage isn't the best, some parts are better than others, and there is some color footage added from a different camera, so I give it a solid 4-stars. Likewise, you won't see any inkling of the troubles that Ike and Tina were having during this time period; the only thing was (as one reviewer pointed out) an exchange between Ann and Tina in the dressing room, which might be missed if you didn't know the back-story.

There's also a booklet with photos and liner notes by Bob Gruen written in 2012. There's no special features on the DVD but has chapter selection (some DVDs don't believe it or not) and still gallery.",1358812800,11,2636,4.885906040268456

5241905,5,B0091JJ20U,I DIDN'T KNOW IT HAD THAT MUCH INSIGHT INTO HER LIFE. I LEARNED HOW SHE LOOKED AND TALKED BEHIND THE CURTAINS. I THINK SHE IS A DOWN TO EARTH PERSON. I LIKE HOW SHE IS HERSELF AT HOME AND A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON ONSTAGE. I SEEN THE IKETTES AND THE WHOLE ENTOURAGE. EVERYBODY WAS CLOSE. I LIKE SOME PERFORMANCES ON THIS DVD THAT I NEVER HEARD OF. I THINK EVERYBODY IS TALENTED. FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAW THE CHILDREN PLAYING AROUND.,1356825600,2,436,4.329268292682927
5241906,5,B0091JJ20U,"I loved seeing the Legend cooking dinner for the family, obsessing over writing song lyrics with the Ikettes and still sporting her original Tennessee accent.",1354406400,,158,5.36
5241907,4,B0091JJ20U,"This footage of Ike and Tina was shot during the peak of their career. Except for some hot performances by the Ikettes, particularly Esther Jones who was with the revue for many years, there isn't much new performance wise that isn't available elsewhere with far better quality. Almost all of the footage is black and white, the quality ranging from good to bad. The sound quality is not good at all.
It is mainly the non-muscial moments that are the best of this documentary and make it a must have for fans. Glimpses of the creative process, Ike at his studio Bolic Sound playing music, Tina talking about writing songs, singing and and rehearsing with the Ikettes, the entire troupe traveling by plane and car, waiting in airports and motels, you get the feel of the well oiled machine that was the Ike and Tina Turner Revue; a professional team of hard working entertainers, and in spite of being in a spot light at night, most of the life does not appear very glamorous. Of particular interest are two contrasting scenes of Tina that could have been shot on the same day; Tina at home as wife and mother, cooking dinner for and interacting with the Turner's sons, all of it appearing very much like a scene out of any typical American middle class family home video, except for the next scene where the conservatively dressed mother serving dinner to her children is now a rock and roll singer serving up a scorching version of ""Feel Good"" in a hot white dress on the Tonight Show.
Filmaker Bob Gruen says the movie Whats Love Got To Do With It showed why Ike and Tina broke up, while this documentary shows why they were together for 20 years. But look closely, evidence of the unhappiness of their marriage is here too: ever present just off camera and occasionally on is Ann Thomas, Ike's mistress. In one scene she comments to Tina that she rarely sees her to which Tina replies, ""I know, you're too busy looking at Ike..."" In another scene Tina comments how hard her entire life has been starting with her parents, while wistfully ruminating how her ""star chart"" predicted her later life would be better. The only genuinely warm, affectionate moments that occur are between the band members and the Ikettes.
All in all, it is a fascinating look into their life and show.",1354320000,13,2280,4.6182266009852215

8534199,1,B0091JJ20U,This was of poor quality. The film had a grainy look to it. The audio was muffled at times. The camera was shaky. There was no doubt that a amateur did this.,1457049600,,157,3.9375
8534200,3,B0091JJ20U,"I was disappointed by this dvd.  I thought it was a concert DVD but mostly it shows Ike, Tina and other people hanging out in various places, talking about this or that, which I thought uninteresting.  The image quality often was terrible.  But the actual concert footage was very exciting.  There probably are better concert dvds of Ike and Tina.",1414972800,,347,4.733333333333333

8534203,4,B0091JJ20U,"Like other films by the husband/wife team of Bob Gruen and Nadya Beck  particularly their smashing look inside the lives of New York Dolls, Lookin Fine On Television  the charm of this documentary lies in the fact that it isn't really a documentary, or even  in the strictest terms  a film, as such. As they did with the Dolls, Gruen and Beck simply moved in with their subjects  both on the road and, literally, at home  capturing raw home movies, alternate views of live performances, over the shoulder and off the cuff interviews, and other voyeuristic visual and audio snippets that were later assembled into a loosely structured long-form film with no narrative voice, either literal or figurative. The end result is a gripping non-documentary that offers a fascinating look into the lives of what may very well be the most volatile couple in the history of rock n roll: Ike & Tina Turner. The behind-the-scenes footage on display here, which has the almost-naughty feel of being captured without the subjects knowledge  though that is not the case, and actually speaks more to the level of regard that Gruen and Beck were held in than to anything else  offers glimpses into the lives and mindsets of both Ike and Tina that may shock, or at least surprise, most viewers. Footage of Tina cooking dinner, clowning around with her children, and ribbing Ike  with no sign of his infamous anger or aggression surfacing  pricelessly reveals the woman behind the glitz and glamor for which shes become known, while footage of the duo onstage performing rip-roaring versions of Proud Mary, Respect, I Want To Take You Higher, River Deep, Mountain High, Walking The Dog, and over a dozen more songs makes it clear that Ike & Tina were damn near untouchable in their heyday. Casual fans may find the films pacing a bit slow in places, and there is no doubt that both the video and audio quality leave a lot to be desired here in the high-definition/digital age, but focusing on any of those things is akin to missing the point entirely. On The Road 1971-72 takes its viewers deep inside the lives of its subjects and collects a series of stunning performances that cannot be seen or heard anywhere else. Ike and Tina Turner were a one-of-a-kind act, and this is a one-of-a-kind film that makes their legend shine a little more brightly, from my perspective. As Gruen points out in the liner notes, the story of Ike and Tina breaking up is well-known, but this film shows why they were together for twenty years before that.",1384646400,3,2518,4.741418764302059

8534206,4,B0091JJ20U,"I'm a great Tina fan, and this is INDEED great footage. Most of it is b&w and you get to see Ike & Tina and the whole Revue + Ikettes as they travel on their early 70s tour. You'll get to see Tina rehearsing her dance moves with the Ikettes, the band travelling on their tour bus/cars/planes, Tina cooking, their kids, etc.

As you will probably read on some other reviews, the sound is not superb. This IN NO WAY means that the sound is bad. It's very good, but recorded back in the seventies with 2 cameras and (I guess) a soundboard for the concerts.

The packaging is very nice with a full color booklet inside. You will notice that some of the songs on the setlist actually don't appear on the movie. Well,it's great footage anyways.",1378684800,,738,4.340579710144928
8534207,1,B0091JJ20U,The video came nicely packaged and undamaged.  But I was sorely disappointed with the quality of the video overall.  Most of it was poorly shot home video that was fuzzy and out of focus.  I am a HUGE Tina Turner fan and I was so very disappointed in the overall quality of this product.,1362355200,3,287,4.277777777777778
