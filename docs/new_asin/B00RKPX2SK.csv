8695460,5,B00RKPX2SK,"Excellent Part Two documentary on censorship of horror videos in England. Disc One features the documentary of the hysteria and political power that led to these films being banned. Discs 2 and 3 have all the trailers which you can watch with or without the explanation of why each was banned. Unlike most documentaries which are very bland and boring Video Nasties is interesting and engaging to the viewer by inserting clips from the films along with critic interviews, reviews and fans who are experts on each film.  Discs 2 & 3 are really fun because instead of focusing on the power of the government they focus on the films which is a lot of fun for anyone who enjoys exploitation or horror movie trailers.",1429401600,2,712,4.696

8695462,5,B00RKPX2SK,"The second volume of 'Video Nasties' may not have the glamour of the first volume but it is a better documentary.  After the first part, you might be wondering what all the fuss was about - especially if you are from America, as I am.  In the second half there are clear descriptions of the consequences of the actions, including loss of liberty and property.  This becomes a story of censors gone amuck, including detailed career paths and the eventual collapse of the system for rating and banning video tapes.

In addition, there are even more trailers and even more in-depth stories about the movies, all of which are fascinating.  Many of the movies are very obscure, although some are popular, and many don't deserve being called 'Nasties'.  I have to admit finding many of the original videos beyond the pale (although I do own perhaps half).  This batch just gets weird in the selection.

Overall, this is the stronger half of the 'Video Nasties' collection, but you need both to truly understand the situation.  I was frankly surprised and appalled by this tale of censorship gone amuck, a group of petty bureaucrats getting drunk on ill-defined power.  Well worth a watch and very well done.",1426636800,3,1201,4.786407766990291
8695463,5,B00RKPX2SK,"I enjoyed the first installment of Video Nasties: The Definitive Guide.  I really, really, really enjoyed Part 2 because this set covers a lot of obscure titles I haven't heard of.  Lots of movies I need to see.  Horror fans will drool.  The commentaries are on par with the first Nasties release.  This is a labor of love.  Easily recommended.  It's a good way to spend 800 minutes of your time.  Call in sick to work.",1424390400,,419,4.421052631578948

I have to confess, to my shame, that I didn't know what Video Nasties were until I watched this documentary.  I had heard the term over the years but always assumed it was related to porn or something of that nature.  Imagine my surprise to learn the truth behind this term.  I had no idea the lengths to which the British government went to try and stamp out indecency in film.  Which is one major reason the VIDEO NASTIES series from Severin Films and CAV Distribution is a must-have for film buffs of any country.  VIDEO NASTIES, PART 2 continues this in-depth excursion into one of the worlds most notorious cases of censorship.

I love the fact this documentary series is the brainchild of director Jake West.  In addition to many successful documentaries, West is responsible for some top notch horror films as well, including EVIL ALIENS and DOGHOUSE.  West is a talented filmmaker, and I hope he has a long career in the industry.

VIDEO NASTIES, PART 2 is shot well and looks great onscreen.  It is filmed in a standard documentary style, with most of the information presented via interviews.  I love this aspect of the documentary, as it makes the data more personal.  Too many times, documentaries are bogged down with too much narration.  Thankfully, that is not the case here.

Probably my favorite part of the VIDEO NASTIES series is the trailers for the Video Nasties are included on a separate disc, and each title has an analysis along with it.  This lets you see a little bit about why the title was put on the list in the first place.  It also gives you a nice trip down nostalgia-lane.

The VIDEO NASTIES series is a major win for me, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Informative and entertaining, this documentary will open your eyes to place in history you might not have known existed.  And if you were already aware, Ill bet there is info in here you might have missed.  Regardless, add this series to your library today.  It is available now.",1424044800,3,2053,4.551912568306011
