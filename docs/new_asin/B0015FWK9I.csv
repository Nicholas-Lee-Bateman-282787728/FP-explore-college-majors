8258286,4,B0015FWK9I,"I'm a new surfer, and this DVD is a tremendous help.  I can't easily find much on YouTube except for how to paddle, catch a wave, and turn.  In the beginner section, this DVD covers things like adjusting your speed so that you stay on the wave longer, riding sideways along the face of the wave, and cutting back to stay closer to the wave break.  They show the right way, and lots of common mistakes in slow motion, explaining how to correct them.  The content is covered swiftly but more completely than I've seen on YouTube videos.

They also cover intermediate and advanced moves in the same fashion, but I'm not there yet.

The unfortunate thing is that this is a region 1 PAL DVD.  Region 1 means it's made to work on North American DVD players.  However, most North American DVD players read NTSC discs as opposed to PAL.  WTF?

If you have a PAL-compatible DVD player, then you're set.  If you don't know than you probably don't, and you should be ordering the different product on Amazon titled ""110% Surfing Techniques Volume 1 NTSC"".  That one should work for 99% of people in the US and Canada.  They should really stop producing this DVD as a ""region 1 PAL"" disc, but I'm stuck with mine.",1308182400,2,1201,4.454128440366972

8258291,5,B0015FWK9I,"I've been surfing now for only a couple of months.  Although I'm able to stand up on the board on white water (the wash that is created after a wave has broken, good practice for beginners) and getting the hang of things, so many questions have been left partially unanswered.  Everyone I've met has shared great tips but early on I knew that I needed a comprehensive resource for the fundamentals AND BEYOND.  Been looking for a vid that works from the ground up and shows exactly what to do when.  Something that goes beyond a one hour surf instruction session, a video that gives you all of the basics but then offers you more advanced techniques for later on.

110% Surfing has definitely satisfied my quest for a comprehensive surfing how-to resource.  SO much great info right away and it gives me so much to look forward to down the road as I get better.  This disc goes the extra mile and I'm so stoked to review it...

The narrator/surfers show you how to do pop ups (get up on the board) AND give you multiple variations, something like five different ways to get up on the board if you're having trouble another way.  They also show you does and don'ts with actual footage of people doing the right and wrong ways.  Trimming your board, turns, even identifying waves, different types of breaks, rip currents, you name it.  You SEE what a rip current looks like, with actual surfers using it to get out to the lineup (spot where surfers wait for waves), etc.  It's SO useful to see these things visually.  People popping up too early, too late, right on time, giving you the feel for what is appropriate in a way that only a visual experience can.  That's what really does it for me, not only describing a proper or improper technique, but demonstrating each and their subsequent outcome.  I spent way too many hours on my first couple of days out trying to figure out the cause for a symptom I was experiencing.  Here you see the symptoms and the causes, pretty much teaching you how to spot what's right or wrong with a wave, a surfer (yourself or someone else) on sight.  This video has immediately cleared up at least half a dozen flaws in my fundamentals, not to mention hipped me to some essential verbage for communicating a concept (pearling, on/offshore winds, swells, rights, lefts, duck diving, etc.).  Can't hurt to use the right terms!

Once you're more than a beginner, the video takes you to some really cool pro tricks and does some really high quality slow motion breakdowns of them.  Not sure if I'll get to that point anytime soon enough, but looks like a great segment if you're looking to learn roundhouse kickbacks, all of that jazz.  They'll show a surfer doing a trick at what looks to be 1/50th speed or so, creeeeping along, using pro sport-style superimposed circles and lines and so on to highlight important aspects of the movement.  Fun to watch, and really informative.

Great vid, definitely recommended from one 'seasoned beginner' to another!",1262563200,7,2986,4.624288425047438
