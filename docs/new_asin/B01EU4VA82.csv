8759587,3,B01EU4VA82,"The first part of ZZ Gundam is so awful and comically weird that it nearly became hard to watch. Thankfully Tomino rescues us from this in the second half, almost like the first half was this big troll to the audience or something.

The second set of ZZ Gundam gets grim and serious, continuing the tone change that the end of the last collection did. Though it's still rather weird we had all these Neo-Zeon clowns acting like idiots in the first part but they suddenly get it together to drop a colony on Earth in the second. Seriously, Glemy Toto is nearly ceasing to be a love struck idiot and instead is a maniacal weirdo who is obsessed with  true Zabi family Zeon blood or something and has an army of Elpeo Ple clones at his disposal.
His Char traits come out big time here as he fully goes through his betrayal on Haman which ends tragically for him. But honestly he's probably one of the weakest Char Clones I've ever seen. Judau and his friends also get serious having to fully cope with the reality of being in an adult's war against Haman which is costing human lives and finding out that yes the Earth Federation is corrupt and cowardly.

Tomino also gets back to his Zeta killing characters indiscriminately technique but he seems not to be in the mood to ice everyone on the show. Mostly I will spoil that Judau's friends for the most part are safe from death. Though Tomino decides to kill one of Bright Noa/Amuro Ray's old friends from White Base in a tragic punch in the gut  death during an early part of this collection.

Judau suffers a tragedy that changes his view on the war with Haman and the gang decides at one point they can take over the controls of a new ship entitled Nahel Argama without Bright bossing them around. After this the federation pretty much leaves Judau and his friends to deal with Haman all on their own with their forces elsewhere. Yeah it's as bad as it sounds, literally they leave everything to a band of teenagers.

Judau has his final confrontation with Haman ultimately after dealing with Glemy's Ple clone army first. And yes his final battle with her is worth every bad second of this show as it's honestly very powerful and a sad end for her as a character.

The show tries to make a lead up to Char's Counterattack with Sayla Mass showing up but nothing doing as there's still gaping holes that make me question why Char himself couldn't of had a bigger role in the show as a whole.",1527638400,,2441,4.435267857142857
8759588,5,B01EU4VA82,Second half of Double Zeta. Excellent job by RightStuf!,1522886400,,55,5.222222222222222

I admit that I am fond of this series, because Gundam-ZZ was my introduction to the Gundam universe in 1986-1987.  Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, Gundam-ZZ, Char's Counterattack, and Gundam Unicorn - in that chronological order - are all chapters of the same saga, as well as other stories like the 08th MS Team.  In particular, I recommend that the viewer watch Gundam-ZZ before watching Gundam Unicorn, because Unicorn was clearly written on the premise that viewers had already seen Gundam-ZZ, and some of the story points cannot be understood otherwise.

This second half of Gundam-ZZ takes a darker turn, and the series really hits its stride.  When the second half begins, we find the Gundam Team on Earth, having landed near Madagascar, but the AEUG flagship Argama is too late.  The Zeon forces have already taken Dakar, the capital city of the Earth Federation. At least on Earth, the Argama crew finds new allies in the Karaba resistance force, which fights Neo-Zeon on Earth as AEUG does in space.

As Karaba launches a pincer attack to assault Dakar from two directions, the Gundam Team launches an operation in Dakar to rescue Judau's younger sister Leina, but the rescue mission goes horribly wrong.

The team continues their journey across Africa.  They are opposed by Neo-Zeon forces who have also found new allies in old Zeon forces who are holdouts from the One-Year War, including an old Zeon mobile suit unit modeled on the German Afrika Korps from World War II.  Both the Gundam Team and the Neo-Zeon forces also have to contend with old conflicts between local populations and descendants of European colonists.

From Africa, the Argama flies to Dublin, Ireland, where Captain Bright attempts to convince complacent and corrupt Earth Federation officials to join their fight against Neo-Zeon.  There, they meet with their former crewmate Fa Yuily, who is now a nurse at a local hospital.  She provides care for Kamiru Bidan, who is a patient there and is still recovering from his neurological trauma.

The Argama receives an emergency call from their Karaba allies.  Neo-Zeon has seized one of the orbital colonies and plans to drop it from orbit and use it as a giant projectile to destroy a target on Earth.  This will serve as a demonstration of Neo-Zeon's power and dissuade anyone from resisting them.  The target is Dublin.  AEUG and Karaba cannot prevent the colony-drop, but they mount a joint operation to evacuate as many people as possible from Dublin.  The Neo-Zeon forces want to kill as many people as possible, so they attack the evacuation effort.  The Gundam Team and Karaba mount a desperate defense of the evacuees, and one of the leading characters from the original 1979 Gundam series makes the ultimate sacrifice.

Even this does not satisfy Neo-Zeon.  They resurrect a Titans mobile suit from the Zeta Gundam series, the gigantic Psycho-Gundam Mark-II, and launch it against the Argama.  Judau and Gundam-ZZ defend their ship, but the Argama crew pays a terrible price, and one of their own falls in battle.  The loss of a dear friend hits the Argama crew hard.

From the Karaba base in Norway, the team returns to space aboard space shuttles.  They leave the Argama behind on Earth, having sold it to Karaba.  Once in orbit, the team finds their new flagship nearing the completion of her construction.  That ship is the Nahel Argama, which later appears prominently in the OVA series Gundam Unicorn.

The Nahel Argama's destination is Side 3, a group of space colonies which once formed the core of the Duchy of Zeon.  Side 3 orbits near LaGrange point L2 on the far side of the Moon.  The Gundam Team's orders are to eliminate the Neo-Zeon threat.  One of Haman Khan's subordinates, who has his own ambitions, launches a rebellion against Haman, and a Neo-Zeon civil war erupts.  The rebel leader has created a group of clones called the New-Type Force.  With their New-Type psionic powers and their Qubeley Mark-II mobile suits, the rebel leader is counting on the New-Type Force to crush the loyalist Neo-Zeon forces and the Gundam Team.  The Gundam Team and Neo-Zeon prepare for the final showdown, a duel that will be decided by physical weapons and New-Type powers.

Here is another tie-in with Gundam Unicorn.  In Gundam Unicorn, we see Marida Cruz, who is the last of the surviving clones from Gundam-ZZ, captured and brought in to be psychologically reprogrammed.  Marida is shown a wrecked Qubeley Mark-II, but viewer cannot understand the context unless he/she sees Gundam-ZZ.

I hope that everyone enjoys this series as much as I did.",1465689600,2,4704,4.897597977243995
