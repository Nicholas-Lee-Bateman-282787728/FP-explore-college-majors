8231811,5,6304287844,"One of the few actors / shows than one can watch with the entire family these days. Funny. The DVD boxes are sturdy / high quality (this really helped, as the exterior cardboard packaging was too thin / low quality) and otherwise the items would have been damaged by water.",1381449600,,273,4.48

8231815,5,6304287844,"This DVD Collection Set is just Awesome. I was searching for it all over the stores but could not find one. When i Googled it i found it on Amazon. Then the first thing i did was to order it. The Package is exactly what it looks like and the contains the same. It took over a month to reach me but then its worth the wait. To see a legend like Sir Norman Wisdom is just so amazing and when you get his collection all rapped up in a box set then what else can you ask for. Just by seeing the cover it brings smile to your face, think how it would be inside. I must say that this is a worth buy for someone who has seen Sir Norman Wisdom in action. I had his VHS earlier but not all his movies. This is the best package that i have ever ordered from amazon.",1336176000,3,755,3.8152866242038215
8231816,1,6304287844,"WISDOM OF THE TRIBES promises to to reveal ""Native American ritual, synonymous with mystical ceremonies, prayers, songs, sweat lodges, peyote, tribal dances, and medicine societies."" However, what WISDOM OF THE TRIBES really reveals is just how bad a low budget, poorly produced and edited video can be.
This video consists of old black and white western footage, footage borrowed from Native American film, home video quality footage of ""fancy-dancing"" at a pow-wow(apparently in a high school gym, and some incredibly poorly lit(either it was bad lighting or they were striving for an artistic cliche)interviews with two Native Americans...all so poorly mish-mashed and strung together as to make one lose interest in the first five minutes.
My partner and I, however, sat through both videos clinging to the hope that there might be some dramatic improvement...much the way someone on a sinking ship might hope help arrives before all is lost. No such luck here. The narration, when it doesn't borrow from comments made by Sitting Bull, Chief Joseph, or other Native leaders, is mediochre at best. The fact that some of the quotes are read with that awful stereotypical pseudo-Native American(the kind that sounds like, ""You bring wampum. Me go teepee."")is profoundly irritating and offensive. Finally, the video does not even track particularly well.
If you are looking to gain instruction or greater understanding of Native American rituals, you won't find it in this video. You'd be better off getting a copy of ""A Man Called Horse"" rather than waste your money on this stinker.",1015977600,2,1584,5.215686274509804
