8302051,5,B001FFTG8Q,"I gave this DVD to my 15-year-old sister who just started playing high school lacrosse in Southern California and she is improving greatly.  Getting a high school sophomore to stop chatting on the internet and work on her lacrosse skills is difficult, but she said the way the DVD was broken down into weekly workouts made the instructions painless.  She says team practice is a lot more fun now that she has more skills.",1228003200,,421,4.675675675675675
8302052,5,B001FFTG8Q,"I've played lacrosse for over 15 years and coached for the last 6.  I just bought this dvd and I must say this is one of the best lacrosse instructional programs I've seen. It's unique because there really isn't another product (that I know of) which explains technique in such detail while giving you a specific plan for making that technique become automatic to you. also, i think players of any skill level can use this program and see huge improvements.",1226275200,,457,4.6419753086419755
8302053,5,B001FFTG8Q,I am a coach and many of my players bought this DVD and saw huge results quickly.  It's so well organized it gives you no alternative other then getting better. I highly suggest it to any player looking to get his game to the next level.,1225324800,,237,4.1521739130434785
8302054,5,B001FFTG8Q,"Started watching ""30 Days to Scoring Success""...captivating video...actually what I really liked was the purposefulness of it all..I think it is good to tell kids (or adults) to play wall the ball 3x week, do these drills, 10 balls each side, do so many dodges, make it really simple with drills so the player knows exactly what and when to do it....it takes a lot of the guess work out of training. For kids, getting them training consistently is the most important thing and ""30 Days to Scoring Success"" goes a long way in helping this happen.",1221436800,,545,4.628865979381444
