5132522,1,B0085A9JXG,I have been a Diana fan since I was a teenager watching her royal wedding to Charles.  I was hoping for something interestingly new or refreshing with this romance but it feel very short.  There was no chemistry between the main actors and the story was very flat. The best characters in the entire film was the Charles and Camillia characters.,1366502400,4,344,4.622950819672131
5132523,5,B0085A9JXG,a really great movie into the meeting and who everything took place.plus their stuggle with the press and their family from two different worlds,1363737600,,144,5.041666666666667
5132524,5,B0085A9JXG,we enjoyed the story so much. The price was good & shippment was FAST. Look forward to more of the movies about the couple & the Queen.,1363305600,,135,4.037037037037037
5132525,2,B0085A9JXG,"The actress that plays Kate Middleton looks like Katie Holmes from her Dawson's Creek days, yet has the bad acting skills of Kristen Stewart.  The film has little context and predictable.  Like the Lifetime version so much better.",1354838400,2,230,5.026315789473684
5132526,4,B0085A9JXG,"The 411 by Maria:

I watched this today while Teach took the kids to the beach for some outdoor time while I rested on the couch.

If like me, you grew up watching Princess Diana marry, enjoyed watching her with her two sons William and Harry while they grew up, were affected by her untimely death, and devastated while you watched those two young boys march behind their moms coffin, you are undoubtedly interested in the lives of William and Harry as adults.

While I don't read everything on their private lives I was aware of most of the movie which depicts Prince William and Kate Middleton's relationship from meeting to engagement.

The actors appearance don't do the actuals just but I thoroughly enjoyed watching the blossoming relationship between a common girl and an actual Prince.

Victor Garber and  Jean Smart as Charles and Camilla do a great job although I cannot picture the relationship they seem to have, I enjoyed when they were on screen.

The scenes of William watching a soft spoken Diana being interviewed and speaking of dealing with the paparazzi were a perfect addition in allowing him to make his decisions throughout the movie I even enjoyed Charles calling the Queen Mum in her bed to discuss children and raising them in this world.

The movie attempts to make the monarchy seem very real and less starchy, something I believe is probably only half true but it is nice to imagine that the royals are just like us.

Decent movie if you are interested in this family and adore the boys as much as I do.",1345852800,16,1533,4.648148148148148
5132527,4,B0085A9JXG,"I watched this movie when it premired on the Hallmark channel...I have to say it was much better than Lifetime's take on Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Why do I think it's a better movie? To be honest the movie script was written better than Lifetimes's; for an example: it included not only Charles's POV on their relationship but also Queen Elizabeth's POV.

Overall an excellent movie, but there is one thing I have against it...the movie didn't show the events between the engagment and wedding; as well as the Royal Wedding itself.

If they did that...it would have been perfect!",1344556800,17,589,4.811881188118812
5132528,1,B0085A9JXG,A typical type movie not reality,1424476800,,32,4.5
5132529,2,B0085A9JXG,"Probably the worst of the Wills and Kate stories. As a fan of the royal family I bought it anyway, but it's not the best.",1418774400,,121,3.88
5132530,1,B0085A9JXG,"Terrible movie. Bad acting, imagined scenes that never took place, Kate comes across as sweet but sappy and you end up wondering why William would choose her. Whenever the young William needs guidance, he slumps in an armchair and watched a video of his late mother (not a real video of Diana, an actress doing an awful job).

I realize no one knows what all these people have said to each other in real life, but inventing a scene where Kate teaches the Queen to play Wii is just a little too out there. The movie is very sympathetic to Prince Charles, which is a nice change of pace, but that's the one redeeming quality of this film.",1407369600,,636,4.389830508474576
5132531,5,B0085A9JXG,"This was the British version, there is a US version also but this one was the better of the two. Just a lovely love story even though they were really guessing as to what may have taken place as all close to Will would definitely not have spoken to anyone about Will that is if they wan to remain a good friend. Nice guessed love story for sure.",1406246400,,345,4.088235294117647
5132532,2,B0085A9JXG,This was cringeworthy and cheesy. The only decent acting was Victor Garber playing Prince Charles.,1404777600,,98,5.6
5132533,3,B0085A9JXG,"I enjoyed the film but think the other one, William & Kate, is better.",1403740800,,70,4.071428571428571
5132534,3,B0085A9JXG,"Like, when I first saw that this was on like the Hallmark Channel, I like thought, ""OMG!  Will and Kate!  Like the Totally Cutest Couple Ever!""  So I just like had to watch.

And so I like made some popcorn, then like sat on the couch, and then like watched my most favoritist lovebirds of like all time!  Yeah.

But like the best part of the movie was when they like ""meet cute.""  How William bumped into Kate, and how Kate dropped her laundry, and how The Prince then like helped her pick up her laundry!  But he's like such a Royal Gentleman that he didn't pick up her, well, underwear!  Like what a nice guy!  And like so dreamy!

So, OK; you get it already, and I'm surprised if you're still, like, reading.  This film's demographic was probably 12 to 17 year old girls.  But while I hate films that play with your emotions -- this one surely does that -- and I hate films where they play cheesy music to continue to play with your emotions -- does it again -- and I really, really, really hate films where some reviewer even considers using the phrase ""meets cute"" (Yikes!  Isn't that the most annoying expression ever?  Maybe even worse than the surely-overused ""like"") -- seen above -- well, I kind of enjoyed watching this pair for some odd reason.  You surely won't have to exercise the old noggin' with this film, so you can easily multitask; how about reading a book and watching?  You should easily be able to do both.

But would the Royals like it?  Well, it surely doesn't air out too much dirty Royal laundry, other than during that scene in the first Act, discussed above.  So they probably think that it's kind of cute, and it won't hurt them therefore in the old PR department.  And I think that you just might like like it too.  Well, at least think that it's ""OK.""",1400112000,,1785,4.361702127659575
5132535,4,B0085A9JXG,I really like this movie.  I tend to like British-type movies slightly less than those involving American situations.  That is why I rated it four stars--nothing wrong with the movie.,1399680000,,183,5.066666666666666
5132536,3,B0085A9JXG,"Not the best William and Kate movie out there, but for people who just adore them, you'll love it. Heavy on the cheeses side.",1398643200,,125,4.25
5132537,5,B0085A9JXG,This is a story of 2 people who are truly I love in real life.  I enjoyed hearing their story!  I highly recommend it!,1393891200,4,118,3.875
5132538,5,B0085A9JXG,One of the things it addresses is the non stop harassment of the media for them but aside from that they do this with class and it is non sensationalized.  It is the gentle development of the love story.  Shows the real person side of the whole family.  How accurate I don't know but it is an excellent story and movie.,1392422400,6,319,4.19672131147541
5132539,1,B0085A9JXG,"I had great expectations regarding this movie, and it was super disappointing. Terrible actors (Kate didn't look like her at all!), terrible acting, location and storyline... Horrible movie!",1391558400,2,190,5.821428571428571
5132540,4,B0085A9JXG,"A pretty good story. Seems to follow what is known. Both actors seem a little too short for the real life people, but overall the story is fairly well done.",1389744000,3,156,4.233333333333333

5132544,3,B0085A9JXG,"I read it was the same movie as the one we viewed on Hallmark, but it was not the one I saw.  It did not go into much details and the actors were far from the look of the actual characters....still I enjoyed it.",1379721600,,211,3.7954545454545454

8525363,4,B0085A9JXG,"Through a series of flashbacks this shows Prince William going off to college where he literally runs into Kate with her laundry, her unmentionables fall onto the floor. They have an art class together. At a fashion show she shows her assets and he is aroused. They become flat mates.

After graduation they have some photographer encounters and he is worried that what happened with his mother Princess Diana will happen with Kate so he kicks her to the curb. They reconnect at a concert. Pretty good, the rest of the Royal Family appears and William calls Charles on the carpet, did that happen? Unknown.",1502755200,,606,4.771428571428571

8525365,5,B0085A9JXG,"Both this movie and the Lifetime ""William and Kate"" movie were sort of 'guilty pleasures,' at least for me.  Neither is exactly Citizen Kane.  But I enjoyed each.  Both are worth watching.  The Lifetime movie is a bit flashier.  This movie is quieter and more stylized.  The Lifetime version relies a bit on showing the glitz and glamor of the royal lifestyle, whereas this film is more heavy on dialog.  I think a lot of the people here criticizing it are reacting to its quiet style and understated vibe.  But I thought in a lot of ways it was a more serious, higher quality movie in terms of being a serious adult movie.  Both are worth watching.  Each actress playing Kate Middleton has their respective charms.  Claire Luddington is beautiful and charming, more articulate and poised as Kate.  Lady Alice Saint Clair who plays Kate Middleton here is particularly charming, though she doesn't look quite as much like Middleton as Claire Luddington in the Lifetime version.  But she has kind of a hoarse, throaty way of talking that gives her an easy-going charm and likability.  She seems more vulnerable and, common .  The film highlights her doing the laundry, carrying her clothes basket, cooking, helping William with his homework, tending bar, and other common type endeavors.  She is a charmer though.  Very likable and down to earth.  The guy playing William here -- Dan Amboyer -- is again a more complex character, seems deeper and more introspective.  In the Lifetime version Nico Evers-Swindell plays the character as a bit more of a stock character - very regal, but also kind of flat and more of a stock prince stereotype.  But both Williams were good for the respective styles of their films.  You don't have to tell your stuffy friends you liked these chatty movies.  The Hallmark one is a little more 'respectable' but not much.  Both are good films and have their charms for the romantic soul in all of us.",1497657600,,1927,4.755287009063444
8525366,5,B0085A9JXG,Good story.  Nice movie. I love it.,1494547200,,35,4.0
8525367,1,B0085A9JXG,"The movie begins with Prince William watching his mother's infamous ""Panorama"" interview with a pensive expression on his face.  This is where the movie starts to go bad: it isn't the REAL ""Panorama"" interview - and, although that's to be expected, one would expect the actress playing Diana to have at least SOME resemblance to the late, beloved Princess. Instead they pick a woman with reddish hair and a lousy accent.  Bad Decision #1.

The movie jumps around in time, with too little spent in the course of their relationship to make it interesting.  Of course we know most of their story, but five minutes of their college years is not enough.  The film should have added at least another hour.  Lousy Script: Bad Decision #2.

The actors playing Charles, Camilla and the Queen also have no resemblance whatsover to their real-life counterparts, although the elegant and stately Victor Garber does his usual best with this lousy role.  (The dreadfully sappy scene of William arguing with his father is squirm-worthy, and only Garber's performance keeps it from becoming an epic fail.)

The young leading stars do their best with their driveling lines and failed attempts at angst and passion.  They do their best to the save the movie, and are its only saving grace besides Garber.

This movie could have been good....and could have been are the key words.  Very very bad.  The worst of the supermarket tabloids will give you more feel and are probably far more convincing.",1478995200,,1478,4.887550200803213
