8000637,4,B0000DCXZX,"Saxon should be mentioned in the same catagory as Metallica
and Megadeath and Motorhead and all those bands who brought
heavy metal to the public who never heard it before! they
reinvented it after Sabbath! but they seem to get lost!
They first few albums are classic metal! now the videos
on here are kinda cheesy but hey everybody was doing it
cause it was new and it helped sell records! this is worth
it for the live Innocence tour video! Biff and the boys kick
butt they way metal use to be played! the videos take them or
leave them but I watch them cause MTV sucked and didn't show
them back then! but Saxon deserves to be given credit for
what they did for METAL before metallica which I hate! and
megadeath! they were superior far as I'm concerned!",1318291200,,757,4.375886524822695
