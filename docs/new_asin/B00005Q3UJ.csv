I work in disability services at a college and this video, purchased for student use, would be great for everybody. For anyone who has experienced what it is like to be an outsider, or struggle for acceptance, it is a cathartic experience that ends on a positive note. I highly recommend this video.",1020211200,,463,4.658536585365853
