8465770,4,B005COLF0I,"This is the story of a family who is facing various challenges while spending the summer at a beach house in Michigan.  They are looking for relaxation, but have to deal with complications including an unexpected pregnancy.  Middle age is not always simple.  I really enjoyed the story line, and the lovely film site.",1397606400,,317,4.833333333333333
8465771,4,B005COLF0I,"Engaging characters, beautiful setting, interesting concept.  I especially liked the way the ending was somewhat open-ended; it allowed for lively post-viewing discussion.",1373932800,2,171,6.7727272727272725
8465772,5,B005COLF0I,I really enjoyed this film. It's charming with engaging performances throughout and refreshingly high production values. (Check out the trailer on YouTube and you'll see what I mean. I hate it when bad cinematography gets in the way of immersing myself in the story.) The characters are easy to care about and the cinematography made me want to book a trip. And the childbirth instructor is a riot! ;-),1361232000,3,402,4.840579710144928

8465774,4,B005COLF0I,"Set on the shores of Lake Michigan, the title refers to a weather phenomena that piles up snow locally and across eastward. The movie begins with Ross Partridge character struggling both financially and in his personal life when his very pregnant somewhat-estranged daughter shows up while he's on holiday with his girlfriend in a stunning, secluded lake-front rental. And then the teen father-to-be shows up: four is definitely a crowd. The characters don't really have much in common but they do try; the movie goes from a farce to a rom-com with some really funny moments in between.

SPOILER ALERT: The film ends predictably with the teenage girl giving birth in hospital with complications and a whole existential ICU scene where you don't know if the baby will make it but everyone learns a alot about themselves in the process. (Just kidding! i just made that up... im not going to spoil it.)",1318464000,3,899,4.875816993464053
