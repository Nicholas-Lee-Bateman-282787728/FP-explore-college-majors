4071888,5,B00361UGDG,Mr. Huttlinger certainly ranks among the finest guitar teachers and guitarists. This DVD meets all my expectations and reveals the true genius of Dan Fogelberg's beautiful and complex music. You won't be disappointed with this one!,1355529600,4,231,5.444444444444445
4071889,4,B00361UGDG,"I also have the Jim Croce volume 1 and 2 DVDs from Pete Huttlinger.  He does a nice job teaching the material, demonstrating his positioning on the fretboard in a slow manner to ease your ability to understand what he is doing.  That being said, I believe that this lesson is not for a beginner.  While one or two of the songs are easier as they involve more strumming techniques, I would say this DVD is more for someone who has experience with barre chords and fingerpicking (or is willing to get to learn these techniques). I thought this lesson was easier than the Croce lessons in that the arrangements and playing style taught on the Croce DVDS were more complex, particularly the fingerpicking style of Croce, which carried through many of the songs taught on those DVDs.  However, if you are a fan of either Dan Fogelberg or Jim Croce, I would recommend all of the lessons with the caveat that it will take alot of practice to learn the songs, especially if your playing level is that of a ""strummer"" like me.  At first, I wished that the DVD had been more of a selection of Fogelberg's greatest hits, but I came to appreciate the Souvenirs album more after watching the DVD.  I even bought the CD to listen to the songs and came to like the songs on it. This DVD gives a nice slice of Dan's guitar playing and I recommend it with the conditions listed above.",1284940800,13,1367,4.426294820717131

8389361,1,B00361UGDG,"I have bought two courses from this instructor and this will be my last.  He just doesn't get it.  There are so many areas of criticism I don't know where to start. This tape is supposed to be low intermediate and it is not.  He plays long, fast riffs and does not break it down sufficiently or provide adequate explanations.  The result is I have to watch his instruction over and over again to see if it an upstroke or a down stroke or his exact fingering.  He does try to explain but it is such a cursory job it is of very little help.  These programs are relatively expensive, yet they don't even provide the lyrics with the audio down load. I have to get them on my own and match them to their limited tabs. The strumming patterns are not shown so you really have to pay attention over and over to get that part.  Compare his work to a site like JERRY'S GUITAR BAR and you will see my point.  Jerry breaks everything down to each note, then to the measure and finally to the verse.  He explains fingering, strumming patterns, tempo., etc.  I can learn so much faster using his instruction.  He also provides lyrics.  There are some great songs on this course but the instruction is just awful.",1516492800,,1198,4.322869955156951
8389362,2,B00361UGDG,He goes too fast in the video. You have to keep rewinding over and over again to see what he's doing. Very frustrating!,1515110400,,119,4.217391304347826

8389364,5,B00361UGDG,"What can I say about Pete Huttlinger except what those people that have seen his teaching methods agree in unison that he is a great teacher, the lessons are very well explained and easy to follow instructions and I am big fan of Dan Folgeberg's music I just wished he could have added Wysteria to the  selection great DVD worthwhile if you want to learn to play some great songs by such a talented musician",1440806400,3,407,4.426666666666667
8389365,4,B00361UGDG,"Received this and turned around and bought volume 2!  Love Dan Fogelberg, Love Pete Huttlinger's way of teaching.  Easy to understand, easy to see on the camera.
Need Pete to give me a lesson on playing ""The Reach"" from Dan's album ""The Innocent Age!""",1432684800,,251,4.681818181818182
8389366,4,B00361UGDG,Can't wait to dig into this!  I've been looking for this type of product for a long time!  God Bless Pete Huttlinger!  God Bless Dan Fogelberg!,1432684800,,143,4.423076923076923

8389368,4,B00361UGDG,I've only started on the first song and so far the instruction has been good. I would recommend it for beginner to novice.,1398556800,,122,4.3478260869565215
8389369,5,B00361UGDG,"I have been a Dan Fogelberg fan since I first heard the song ""Souvenirs"". The song made me stop in my tracks. I immediately had to know who the artist was. I have everything he has ever recorded starting with albums. Then cassettes, then CDs. I had the privilege to see him in concert alone and with a band many times.  Pete Huttlinger is a master on the guitar. I drove out of state to see him play and have many of his CDs. I heard about him when he won the Fingerstyle Guitar Championship in Winfield, Kansas.  He is amazing.  Pete plays each song through once then breaks down the song showing the fingering of the left hand and the chords and position of the right hand on the keyboard. This DVD has many of Dan's most popular tunes.  ""The Leader of the Band"" and "" Make Love Stay"" along with "" Old Tennessee"" to name a few.  This is the second DVD of Dan's music by Pete. I think another DVD should be in order. One that includes "" Wysteria"", ""Stars"" , Hard to Say"" and "" The Reach "" to name a few.  The songs are set in order of easiest to play to the more advanced player.  You can also download the Tabs for each song. Excellent way to learn the songs of Dan Fogelberg.",1389052800,3,1178,4.117903930131004
