I am 62 yrs old and have been fly casting for 40 yrs. I have 4 or 5 other videos, (one of Lefty's) and for any price this is better than any the other video I've seen!
Not even his newer video's do as good a job of teaching the basics to a beginner!!!

The key is in the approach he takes. This tape uses youngsters to demonstrate and a vastly different style to start with... one which you have to see to understand the benifit.
But he doesn't stop with just the basic cast. The tape covers all the casting techniques and types of line a good fisherman should know as well as when to apply each method or style.
I mentioned the youngsters... for my money they are key in that implicitly the viewer gets the message that strength is not critical to being good... plus they generate the ""if these two kids can do it, I can"" challenge.
I have taught a pile of beginners in my time...(all ages and either sex) and in just a few hours of video review, and answering thier questions as they practiced, most if not all learned enough to actually catch fish the first time out. Honestly this tape, a good rod, line, and a fishing buddy at the same level, and the two of you can teach yourselves on just one weekend.
[ helpful tip... people who try to learn on their own and with inferior equipment inevitably end up with a bunch of bad habits that will hold them back! You need a good friend, and good equipment! AND YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FLOAT A LOAN FOR A GOOD ROD. BUT YOU DO NEED A BALANCED ROD WITH GOOD CLEAN EYELETS, AND A LINE THAT MATCHES IT'S POWER CURVE... I DON'T THINK THIS TAPE DOES A GOOD ENOUGH HERE BUT THE INTERNET DOES ALL YOU NEED... JUST GOOGLE BEFORE YOU BUY.
A $70 rod from Cabelas might be perfect if it is built correctly... Frankly spending any more just isn't necessary till you start getting serious and going after those challenging fish and fisheries. But I'm getting off topic.

If you wish to take up fly-fishing start with these video's, pick a buddy to learn with and watch at least 3 times before investing another nickle. The next step is picking up the rod and a couple of matching fly lines, and a reel.
[helpful tip... Take the video's audio with you when you practice maybe an ipod or a phone...recording you will be amazed at how quickly you learn].
LOL... I could keep giving examples and repeating myself but hey... it's less than $10!
As my grand dad used to say... ""Bow down river and dry side up""

8433025,4,B000PG3240,"This video centers on Lefty Kreh's three principles:
1. The longer you move the rod through an arc the more the rod contributes to the cast.
2. You have to get the end of the fly line moving before you can make a cast.
3. The direction in which you stop the  rod tip at the end of the cast is where the fly goes.
These principles were illustrated by casts from Lefty Kreh and a girl student with the line cast from a position lying stretched out on the grass behind and then cast to a similar position in front with a 180 degree casting stroke.
Mr. Kreh recommends the thumb on top grip and the open stance - right foot back for a right hander. He further observes that the biggest fault in casting is starting with the rod tip high.
He begins the demonstration part of the $[...] video with the admonition that you do not make the back cast by coming up and snapping but by coming back and pointing the rod in the direction you want the line to go and using a stabbing motion of the rod in that direction. The stab is a thrust backward and appears to eliminate tip snap on the back cast. He explains that the stab keeps the rod tip from driving the line down.  He wants the line and the fly rod to be in a straight line to allow the caster to move the rod and arm through a longer arc.
At this point in his demonstration with a student he pointed out that the size of the loop is determined by the amount you move the wrist. His student, a teen aged girl, used the double haul in following his instructions.
Mr. Kreh went on to state that the haul should be short - six inches - and to remark that people who make long hauls - 3 feet - put three feet of slack in the line. He advocates a late short haul - just as you stop on the back cast and as you ""flick"" on the forecast and remarks that you can throw 100 feet with a five inch haul. A long haul puts several feet of undesirable slack in the line he states and he advocates that the line hand never be more than 12 inches from the reel. His demonstration of the double haul involved a snap at 1:30 and a drift but no stab.
The three principles of the roll cast are:
1. Stop the rod way behind the caster and let the line drop.
2. The quicker you make the rod stop at the end of the cast the quicker the line takes off.
3. the distance you move the wrist determines the size of the loop.",1176508800,3,2341,4.0
