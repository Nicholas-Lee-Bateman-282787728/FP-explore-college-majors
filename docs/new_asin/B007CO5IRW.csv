Stefanie Scott is evil like always, but she did a really great job as Julianne.  As for Bella & Zendaya, seeing them in this movie was fun.  Mary Mouser did good in both of the roles she did.  It looked like it was a hard gig for her to do.  I would recommend this film.",1341532800,3,402,4.223684210526316

8514658,5,B007CO5IRW,"Frenemies is a movie, but it's three different stories, the main two characters from each of the three are in the other two, but as minor characters.  The first two stories involve something coming between two best friends, the last one the old, switching places by two kids from different walks of life, one rich, one poor.  The movie is very similar to most kid actor TV shows around the time it was made (2012) in fact the three stories could easily have been episodes of a longer running than the 90 minutes show.  The actors are all from other Disney teen shows and are quite recognisable.  Some such as the main human character (the other is a dog) from the first story have gone on to star in films like Jurassic World.

Assuming these kids are all in the same grade, the characters are all 14 years old. The first Frenemy tale is between two best male friends, one is a boy, one is a dog. What comes between two best male friends. A girl of course.  The human is a straight A student, in class his science teacher announces they will be doing their important science project in groups of two.  The hot girl of the class who he's never spoken a word to before asks to pair up with him.  When they go to his house after school, she doesn't like his canine bestie nor does he like her. Both dog and girl try and  get the other in the bad books with the boy.

In the second tale, two fashion bloggers who have three followers, themselves and one of their mothers, are denied an advertisement in the school's newspaper about their blog by the school newspaper editor (another kid).  However they are contacted by a Manhattan actual fashion magazine to come meet the owner (they live nearby).  When they they are told she likes what she has read and offers a job (both girl's dream one) to write for the magazine.  But she's not offering two jobs.  Since the two girl's can't decide who should get the opportunity they are assigned to each write a news story and bring it back.  Both want to interview a new indie French rock star coming to town whose concert is sold out.

The third you've seen countless times before.  A skater girl who lives with five brothers and her dad, thereby misses out on food and bathroom time runs into a rich British girl at the shops whose parents won't let her get a dog.  The blog girls from the second story suggest they trade places for a week.  Both desperate to escape their lives jump at the chance.",1494806400,,2439,4.38
