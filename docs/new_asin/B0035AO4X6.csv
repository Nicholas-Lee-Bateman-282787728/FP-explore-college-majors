4070084,5,B0035AO4X6,"I'll make this review brief because there are plenty of very thorough and great reviews already, but I received my copy a few weeks ago and have been greatly enjoying the mantras and meditations.

I really like the extras, the primers and their explanations of each meditation.

I found the music to be absolutely wonderful, proving once again that Ravi and Ana have a great ear for music and sound.

The only part that didn't quite work for me was the ""tune in"" part, the Ong Namo was a bit fast for my taste, and I found the rather loud music distracting, but I do appreciate that they change up their Ong Namo from dvd to dvd, and it wasn't a problem, I just put it on mute for that part.

Overall, I gave this 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in taking their first steps into meditation or looking to deepen their existing practice.",1269993600,4,856,4.39873417721519
4070085,5,B0035AO4X6,"I've been doing Kundalini Yoga for 30 years, and using Ana and Ravi's tapes and dvd's for about 12 years, but this tape has lifted my practice to a beautiful place!  Try it and be amazed.  I especially love the Rewrite the book of your life meditation.",1269648000,6,252,4.340425531914893
4070086,5,B0035AO4X6,"This DVD is like nothing else!  If you like kundalini, and you like kundalini meditations, you must get it!  It's transcendent.  The selections are many and varied, and the effects are truly magical.",1269561600,5,199,4.96969696969697
4070087,5,B0035AO4X6,"I love this dvd. It is perfect if you want to enhance your meditation practice, especially if you are already a fan of Ravi Singh/Ana Brett Kundalini yoga. I have with this one included, 11 dvds of theirs. I always have struggled to do the meditations at the end of the programs and usually skip them, instead choosing to close with the deep relaxation and the closing prayer. I don't skip them because they aren't great, its just hard to fit all of that in during one practice. I have often thought how nice it would be to take those meditations and make a dvd just of them, and thats what they have done!

 This dvd is a solution for me because it allows me to make a devoted time only for meditation. It is put together very well and they have included extended meditations, some lasting 31 minutes as well as pre selected workouts, the AM and the PM was a great idea. They have the matrix which allows you to make your own workout, which is very important for this particular one. I haven't done everything on the DVD yet, just got it yesterday but last night I watched the commentary on the meditations, which is great as it explains everything and did the PM meditation. Beautiful, very peaceful. The music is nice, very Indian which I love having lived there and feel a real connection with.

 If you want a dvd that is only meditation and put together beautifully, you should purchase this. If you have never done a RaviAna dvd you should purchase it too! They are very special people that have a wonderful gift to give, very inspirational.",1268265600,12,1548,4.459363957597173
4070088,5,B0035AO4X6,"Most people learn that meditation is sitting still and letting go of all thoughts that come to mind. Ravi and Ana have created a far more satisfying road to tranquility.

There are may means of focusing mind and body so that the racing mind lets go and is replaced by calm. This video offers lots of techniques. Movement of the arms distributes energy between head and heart. Movement of the neck clear the passage between head and heart. There are visualizations of light, breathing practices, and mantra to occupy the mind in a nourishing manner.

You can do the entire video or make one of the techniques your own as a daily practice.

The music is beautiful.

I like the down to earth approach and outfits. You don't have to be a holy person to benefit from this work.",1267574400,8,772,4.532374100719425
4070089,5,B0035AO4X6,"I have never enjoyed meditation so much until I first brought Ravi and Ana's Dvd KUNDALINI YOGA FOR BEGINNERS AND BEYOND. Ravi and Ana have a way of combining Meditation music and instruction to the point that my mind was still, WOW!!! If I can still my mind and reap the benefits of meditation, you can too! What can I say about this Dvd I love the guided meditation, I love the Mantra and the variety.
If a meditaion doesn't suit you today try another. Thanks for the many blessings Ravi and Ana. I love the dedication to Yogi Bhajan at the end, I'd like Ravi and Ana to know that you have done soo much good for Kundalini yoga and made it more modern and appealing to all. I love Sikhism thanks for the introduction to Yogi Bhajan and Sikh teaching. Last but not least all the Fantastic DVDs, I wouldn't have the peace in my mind, body and soul if I didn't buy your Dvds. Patanjali said that""when the student is ready he will  find a teacher""
BUY this Dvd and find the only Yoga teachers that you will ever need.",1267401600,8,1015,4.259067357512953
4070090,5,B0035AO4X6,"If you are a big fan of the material produced by Ravi and Ana, then one of the uniqueness of their kundalini dvds is that they combine movement with a section on meditation/mantra. here in this dvd is a collection of meditations that you could either a) choose your own combination to work on that day or b) use click onto one of the six pre-determined meditation program that ranges from beginner (if you are new to Ravi and Ana, then this is a must to as they will help you to make the most of the meditation session when you are selecting your own program).  For those of you who are already familiar with Ravi and Ana's format then you will absolutely love this one.
What I love about this new dvd is that I can now focus just on breathe work, which is such a fundamental foundation to yoga and often not touched on in other yoga dvds.  The pre-determined meditation programs are excellent if you have about 40 to 50 minutes; I loved the AM and PM ones, which were brilliant to get my day going and for the ultimate calm down at the end of the day. I have been hyper stressed with taking care of my elderly parents, as well as holding down a job that some days all I want to do is to re focus my energy.  This dvd works well with the ultra stretch kundalini yoga dvd: great combination to work the stress out of your mind and out of your body.

Believe me, breathe work is just as challenging to the body and mind as the Navel power dvd!  Well worth the money and I am hyper pleased to add this dvd to my Ravi and Ana collection and weekly workout.  Kundalini yoga has transformed my life, both spiritually and physically: thank you Ravi and Ana for sharing your knowledge.  Sut Nam",1265155200,30,1686,4.233644859813084
4070091,5,B0035AO4X6,"This is a wonderful meditation DVD - you can literally find a meditation to suit every goal and purpose and every mood.
I have been practicing Ana and Ravi's style of Kundalini Yoga daily for several years and absolutely love all their work. I am so grateful for this meditation DVD. All Ana and Ravi's DVD have either one or two meditations or mantras following the yoga sets, and this new DVD proivdes some excellent new meditation work.

The previous reviewer Desert Dancer has done such a wonderful job describing the meditations in detail, I'll only just add my impressions.

I was very grateful for the Sitting Primer - Ana and Ravi explain the benefits of sitting cross legged and offer modifications. The Mantra Primer addressed some concerns people may have - i.e. mantras are not religious and do not represent a conflict with any religious practices, etc.

The meditations start with the breath work - and then several very lovely, deep meditation practices follow, each for a different purpose, but ultimately all for a common goal.

Following the Final relaxation, there's also a lovely beautiful Healing Mantra (same words were used on the Inflammation Relief segment of Dr Yoga House Call). In a bonus segment there are also options to do two of the most profound meditations for 31 minutes.

The set is the same as in the previous three releases - the greens, lake front, etc. Ana's demonstrations and Ana and Ravi's commentary make all the techniques easy to understand and master. Ana looks very beautiful and radiant as always, and the music is very pleasant.

An excellent Meditation DVD - thank you so much, Ana and Ravi!",1265068800,41,1642,4.8464285714285715
4070092,5,B0035AO4X6,"In case you don't want to read this entire review, in one sentence let me say: This is an AMAZING meditation DVD and I'm sure that everyone at all levels of meditation will love it and benefit from it. This DVD will get anyone started on meditating and be a deeper meditation tool for those who already meditate. I fell in love with it right away. I felt amazing after doing each of the meditations...each one covers a different aspect. I am amazed at Ravi and Ana's work on this DVD. It makes me look so forward to meditating! I'm so excited to share this DVD with others!
The music is beautiful. For those of you who were unsure about the music on Raviana's three DVDs last year, you won't have any hesitations about this music...it is incredibly beautiful...it brought me to tears several times; tears of peace and a blessed heart. The music is meditative, serene, peaceful, trance-like at times, and it evoked images in my mind of beautiful landscapes of India.

4070093,3,B0035AO4X6,"I found this to be moderately okay.  This is my first exposure to kundalini yoga.  The positions or forms themselves were very helpful, but teh artificial background and music were, quite frankly, distracting.  However, it's still a pleasant experience.",1444262400,,253,5.435897435897436
4070094,1,B0035AO4X6,"I guess this video could be relaxing for someone but it is really quite strange.  There is 70's style music playing with voice overs throughout. I found it more of a comedy, right out of Saturday Night Live, than anything close to being relaxing and spiritual. I am returning this as soon as possible.  Save your money.

4070101,5,B0035AO4X6,"I've been a meditator for years.  I've tried a couple different varieties.
I watched this once and didn't like the complexity and superficial nature of so many short meditations and put it away.
A year later, I pulled it out again to show a particular section to my daughter and this time realized it had a matrix menu option where you can pick out whatever length of meditation you want and whichever type of meditation you want.  You can mix/match them however you want.  Now I use it daily and LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  Whether you use it for relaxation or to learn to dive deep into stillness--it can help.

4070117,4,B0035AO4X6,Just opened it up yesterday and found a lot of really great and easy to do breathing exercises and meditations.  Always looking for a variety in my meditations so I don't get to bored or they become ineffective.  Some are a little above me right now as I am new to Yoga and Kundalini isn't the easiest form of Yoga.  Maybe it just seems that way because I'm a beginner.  But I think I'm going to like it and find it useful to intermix with my other meditations and Yoga styles.  It also has a multi-choice and create-your-own mix matrix menu that is VERY helpful and will help this disc to be useful to me for a long time to come!,1385337600,,630,4.1735537190082646

4070119,5,B0035AO4X6,"This DVD is more mediation than yoga.  The mantras are in Sanskrit but beautifully explained.  If you are looking for a physical yoga experience you may be disheartened.  However, it is a great way to begin the spiritual practice of meditation if that is what you are looking for.

If you are really looking to improve your health, lose weight or simply explore this art of Yoga take my advice and give their DVDs a shot, I bet you won't be dissapointed, they are better than any instructor led class.

4070134,5,B0035AO4X6,"I believe this is the #1 Kundalini DVD Series out there.  I discovered this Kundalini Yoga Series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh on Amazon about 2 years ago and it is incredible.  I have been doing casual yoga of various sorts here and there via DVD and at the (Hatha, Kripalu, etc.) over the years but this series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh fundamentally changed my approach to wellness, fitness,  personal growth and outlook on life.  I was totally new to Kundalini Yoga and, frankly, a but skeptical about it since it has some ""unusual"" moves and poses and chanting compared to other forms of exercise and Yoga I have done at the gym and via DVDs.  Now I see the power of Kundalini via Ana and Ravi ""technology"" that integrates physicality, mindfulness, and spirit.  It is not easy at first - but that is the point.  You do what you can, dot judge yourself and you reap massive benefits.  I progressed quite rapidly from things I felt were impossible but worth trying to not so hard to challenging to ""not hard any more"".  I feel GREAT every single time I complete a DVD - -my mood, my body, my creativity, my stress, my mind clarity, my stamina, etc.  Its truly amazing.  The key to reaping these benefits is to not get caught up in saying ""this is weird"" but to say ""just try it and see how you feel"".  Incredibly fit and wise people did this type of yoga and meditation hundreds and thousands of years ago as a regular regime but Western society has somehow made it non-traditional and inaccessible.  Many other types of Yoga focus too much on the body and physicality and don't see the mind, body, spirit interconnection like Ravi and Ana.  Ravi and Ana make it so accessible - combining direction on how to do the poses and breathwork and sounds (mantras) that vibrate your body to heal it, strengthen it and give new clarity.  Ana demonstrates the poses (don't be intimidated by how easy she makes things look - just do your best is what I found) and Ravi and Ana explain the physiological basis of how each pose affects your glands, nervous system, muscular system. Brain and energy and spirit.  Ravi has amazing poetry sprinkled in to make it just a beautiful relaxing experience (even though its quite physical!).  The production is very professionally done -- different angles, alternatives if you have certain issues or challenges, music editing, pacing, etc.  I totally recommend any of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVD's to anyone whether you do Yoga already or not.  It can truly take your fitness to another level along with your outlook on life.

I am so glad that I didn't let anyone's negativity keep me from investing in what has been a life changing yoga practice for me. I used the breath techniques and meditations on this DVD after a surgery when I couldn't really do anything more. I started flat on my back in bed, and then as I got stronger went to sitting in a chair to sitting on the floor to doing a full physical Kundalini Yoga practice again. Not only do I feel this speeded up my healing process, but it made me stronger from the inside out, and I felt happier than I ever have in my life. I still do a part of this DVD every single day.

With all due respect, what made you different Ravi & Ana, was that you had a simple sound and look; and, you had an understated class and grace!

I like to maximize my time and I couldn't get used to the thought of sitting around doing nothing. I know now that that attitude is simply silly. To paraphrase what Ana and Ravi say somewhere: when you are meditating the whole Universe is working for you, so you are actually getting a lot done! There are many different types of meditations here. It's all not sitting in silence. There are about 13 segments. Some are breathing meditatiions. Some use sound, etc. You definitely use all of your meditation muscles, LOL. Overall, this is another great release by two of the most talented people in the yoga world.

Before I started practicing their amazing DVD's, I just couldn't find an inroad into practicing it. I have tried unsuccessfully to meditate before but I find Ana & Ravi's approach really accessible. This DVD consists of about 13 meditative techniques which range from breathing exercises to silent meditation. The music which accompanies the meditations is excellent. Ana & Ravi's gentle encouragement take your through ""...your mind's mazes to that certain self."" Ever since I started practicing along with this I am calmer, more focused, and less reactive.

All I can say is that I'm glad I previewed them before giving them to my brother because they were the most bizarre form of yoga I've ever encountered.

When I don't have time for a full practice, I might do warmups from another of their DVDs and then put this DVD in and do a meditation or two, and then finish with the blissful final relaxation. It's delightful. I often don't come out of it as quickly as they do, choosing to continue to lie there and listen to the healing mantra, which follows, with my hands over my heart. For some reason this mantra lulls me into a deep state of peace. Thank you, Ravi and Ana, for helping me cope with stressful days! Sat Nam",1292284800,10,803,4.1210191082802545

Lately my stress level has been off the charts and I wanted to try to get a handle on it. This was the logical choice for me. This is made such a difference in my life. I'm able to take a step back from things and not sweat the small stuff. I don't go off on people like I used to and I'm much happier overall. Most people (I'm takling from experience) think that they can keep going full tilt and not pay the price. As I result of practicing this DVD I'm can't believe I ever got along without it. It has about 12 different meditation with different combinations of breathing, mental focus, and hand positions. They are all amazingly effective. You can use the Matrix Menu options to combine them to suit your time. Ravi & Ana are geniuses in their ability to bring profound ancient teachings down to earth so they are completely relevant to life now. I you are even vaguely curious about what meditation is and what it can do for you, I encourage you to try this.

One thing that I had to not focus on was the music which on some of the meditations it was a little too upbeat for me but then maybe that type of music is part of the Kundalini yoga tradition.

4070159,5,B0035AO4X6,"Having purchased and reveiwed quite a few of  Ravi/Ana DVD's it may seem like I'm a bit biased ;-)  Maybe I am (?), maybe not, it's just that it seems that the Ravi/Ana team puts so much thought into what the viewer may need or want, that every DVD seems custom made for me.  I LOVE the Pre-sets, I LOVE the chaptering, I LOVE the Matrix, I LOVE the explanations, cueing, and soothing details, I LOVE the positive affirmations and reinforcements, I LOVE the encouraging words etc., ...you get the picture.
There really is nothing that I don't like about the series and this DVD is no exception.  I've only completed 4 of available (7 on the chapter sets and two additional extended meditiation), but after just 15 minutes of meditation, I felt calmer, clearer and not as stressed.  This was the reason I bought this particular DVD. I have other meditation DVD's, but the ability to tailor the mediation to my needs (Self healing, rewriting the script of my life, total regeneration, etc.) and also to my time limitations makes this DVD worth every penny spent.
The other DVD's last a prescribed amount of time and if you don't want or need to meditate that long, you have to stop the DVD or fast forward to the relaxation..it doesn't work for me...in fact it's more stressful, because my mind is on the clock and not clear.  With these meditations, you can ""set the DVD"" for a Tune-in, 15-90 minutes (or more) meditation, guided relaxation and then do what it is you sat down to do...clear your mind.  You know that the DVD will only go for 20 minutes and you'll hear the cueing telling you it's time to come back.  It's like having teachers/gurus/friends come into my room for a few minutes of the day and spend alone time.
I never tire of this series and it always delivers what I need..
Thanks so much Ana and Ravi....",1281225600,17,1821,4.513677811550152

4070161,5,B0035AO4X6,"Kundalini Yoga for beginners and beyond with Ana and Ravi

Firstly a little about my journey so far. I discovered Kundalini Yoga just over a year ago now and prior to that I had a regular practice of Hatha yoga (a beautiful practice). When I commenced Kundalini Yoga I resonated with it completely, it was what I had been looking for, I felt like I had 'come home' and something 'clicked' into place. I practice daily in a morning and benefit greatly throughout the day. I have a good library of DVD classes by Ana and Ravi and they are all wonderful to work with. I have also developed a small library of books including some by Yogi Bhajan which I find very inspiring.

Now to the review

Bliss.. Ecstasy.. Tranquility.. Grounded.. and yet Energised...........Beautiful

This DVD was everything that I hoped that it would be and more.

The production is good quality, attractive scenery in the background with greenery, seascape, lotus flowers, bhudda statue and then the area in which Ana demonstrates. The sound quality is good and the music I found so beautiful and uplifting.

Ana demonstrates the postures and meditations beautifully, she looks so calm, peaceful and radiant and that is how I feel when I am working throughout the class.

There is a very good selection of chapters and you can also do presets or design your own class depending on your own situation for time etc with the matrix option which is easy to use and has a demo section on how to use it.

The instruction is clear by Ravi and Ana and there is explaination throughout about the methods, how they work and the benefits they give. I felt like I went deep into meditation whilst working with this DVD, it was absolutely lovely and I feel blessed to have the opportunity to work with it.

The class starts with Tune in via mantra. Then the choice is yours.

There are so many options for whatever you wish to work on eg:
Meditation for tranquility,
Breath purification,
Eliminate stress and self bless,
Opening the third eye,
Rewrite the book of your life,
All and everything meditation,
Meditation for total regeneration,
Meditation into deep stillness,
A beautiful healing mantra 'Ra Ma Da Sa Sa Say So Hung' this was total bliss!.

The presets include one for beginners and also there is a section on the breath primer for those who are new to Kundalini Yoga so that you can learn the long deep breathing and Breath of Fire before you do the chosen meditation.

There is a lovely guided relaxation lying on your back in Savasana.

Then class ends with a final prayer and Tune out via mantra.

I will be working with this DVD regularly and especially on a Sunday as that is my rest day and I focus on Pranayama and Meditation on this day so this DVD is just what I was looking for and it is just bursting with options.

I am truly grateful to Ravi and Ana for producing this DVD, I feel just wonderful during and following the class...this is a treat.

Then there's the things I don't like - the production values seem really amateurish. The sound is poorly recorded with too much reverb and the occasional echo, and I find that incredibly distracting. Which is of course my problem :)

4070166,3,B0035AO4X6,"While I love most of the Raviana dvds, I was disappointed with this one, mostly due to production issues and music selections.  When I got my dvd from amazon, there was a grinding sound in my player and the dvd would only play on my 10 year old dvd player.  Also, the audio was very low and on the deep relaxation meditaion, the ""wahe guru"" chant kept fading in and out.  So I sent it back for a replacement.  On my 2nd dvd, the sound quality was still bad.  It was low with an echo and the meditation chant still faded in and out.  I e-mailed raviana and they said they purposely recorded the wahe guru chant to go in waves. What??? While I was doing this meditation, I got so annoyed trying to hear the chant as it faded in and and out that I felt steam coming out of the top my head. As for the music choices for the other meditations, I found them to be distracting with the exception of Wah Yantee, a chant by a singer I love.

In the end, I decided to send the dvd back for a refund.  While the dvd has wonderful meditations, if the sound and music is an issue, how can I relax??",1270252800,16,1085,4.037383177570093
