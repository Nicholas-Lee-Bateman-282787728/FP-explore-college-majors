7925148,5,B00004WG3E,So funny! I was watching this when I was 12 or maybe 14..I'm not sure but its hilarious. I probably didn't get some of the jokes back then but I really enjoyed it when I got older and I still recommend it now.,1457740800,,209,3.883720930232558

7925150,5,B00004WG3E,"This is the second volume in this side-splittingly funny 1990s British comedy. Those who've enjoyed the first volume (and it really is best to watch this series from the beginning) will love this volume just as much, as the humour continues along the same vein.
Dawn French plays Geraldine Granger, the new vicar, who seems to be the only sane person in the charming little village of Dibley. In this volume, the vicar continues to prove that she is eminently capable of providing for the needs of the parish, much to the chagrin of the pompous, self-serving David Horton. The vicar also continues, wherever possible, to get the better of David. The balance of this assorted and eccentric cast of characters consists of the ditsy and naive verger, Alice Tinker, and her intellectual equal, Hugo Horton (David's son); Frank, the village council's incompetent secretary; Owen, a rustic farmer with his own distinct brand of farmyard humour; the dithering Jim; and last but not least, Letitia Cropley, a geriatric nymphomaniac and ""Dibley poisoner.""
This video consists of three 30-minute episodes. Briefly, in ""The Weather and the Window,"" the church window is damaged in a storm and the vicar must somehow raise the money to pay for its replacement. ""Election"" has David Horton campaigning to keep his seat as District Councillor; this time, however, he's up against a little competition--from the vicar. Finally, in ""Animals,"" the vicar has the novel and unorthodox idea of holding a blessing for the animals of the parish. This last episode (as many an animal lover will no doubt agree) is truly the most beautiful of all; it is certainly my own personal favourite.
In conclusion, this is classic British comedy at its best. Along with the hilarity, there is also a real tenderness that pops up from time to time--moreso in this volume than in the first. It's without a doubt one of the best series (British or otherwise) that I've ever seen. Extremely highly recommended!",1002758400,15,1973,4.9818181818181815
7925151,5,B00004WG3E,"The Vicar of Dibley: Volume 2 contains episodes 4, 5, and 6 from the first season of the show. (Note: British television 'seasons' are often much shorter than their American counterparts. Instead of having nearly two dozen episodes, Vicar of Dibley's first season has only 6.) With writing by Richard Curtis ('Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'Bean', and the BBC's 'Blackadder') and the considerable comic talents of Dawn French, this series is well worth seeking out.
French stars as the new Vicar in the tiny village of Dibley. While French can anchor a show all by herself, what really makes this show wonderful is the ensemble cast. For example, the regular church meetings, a staple of every episode, usually provide some of the best moments. And even though you can get away with saying some wild things on British television that wouldn't be allowed in America, this series never becomes vulgar or profane.
British television also seems to be a lot more realistic than American programming. For example, the camera isn't limited to filming full-figured Dawn French from the waist up, nor is her character forced to spend screen time ruminating about how she ""really should lose weight"". Instead, everyone in the village admirers her, for reasons that are evident in these episodes. Her character has flaws and dreams just like any one else, but her weight is simply not an issue.
This is a very well-balanced show; religion doesn't keep it from being side-splittingly funny, but the jokes do not make fun of religion, either. I highly recommend the Vicar of Dibley.",998265600,8,1569,4.969581749049429

7925153,5,B00004WG3E,"O.K., Dawn French is probably one ofthe funniest comedians around.  And, to put her into a TERRIFIC television series like this is pure magic.  In a time when women are finally being excepted as religious leaders, this show  was perfect to give some comedy about the subject - but not in a negative  way.  Every character is wonderfully built with background and pesonality,  meaning that each character is more life-like the more you watch it. I just  resently bought this tape and I laughed so hard that I needed to take a  break from watching it!  Buy this tape, along with the others in the  series, for hours of laughter.",952128000,4,626,4.609090909090909
