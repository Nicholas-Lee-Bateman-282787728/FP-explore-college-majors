1215162,5,B00000G07E,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE THAT TELLS A WONDERFUL STORY..JESSICA TANDY, HUME CROYN AND ESPECIALLY JOHN DENVER SHINE AS THE STORY UNFOLDS.  IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES, AND I HAVE WATCHED IT DOZENS OF TIMES...AND WILL WATCH IT A DOZEN MORE  . .NO DOUBT.  BUY THIS MOVIE.  I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY..",1266364800,,307,4.428571428571429
1215163,5,B00000G07E,"For me the only thing I needed to know was it starred John Denver.
 I think he was great. It was a heart warming movie showing how people could live their life as they wanted and not be put down for what they believed in.  I have watched it several time already and will no doubt watch it again and again",1252886400,,304,3.9672131147540983
1215164,3,B00000G07E,"The fabulous duo is Jessica Tandy whose husband passed away but is still around as a ghost. Her dead husband is played by her real-life husband, Hume Cronyn. Both actors have passed away but their work is alive in many movies, including Foxfire. The basic plot is simple. Their son, played by the late, great singer John Denver, wants to convince his mother her best move is to leave her mountain home and live with him in Florida. During the movie we see flashbacks showing problems between father and son, but also a deep love for family and the mountains. Wonderful scenerey, the widow's refusal to leave the only home she's known and her husband's ghost, old-time ethics, and the running dialoge between the woman and her husband's ghost. I gave it three stars because of a bit too much ""aw-shawks"" to suit me, and songs not likely to be sung in a real Denver concert, but definitely worth watching this Hallmark Hall of Fame movie just for the pairing of Tandy and Cronyn.",1242604800,7,977,4.620689655172414
1215165,5,B00000G07E,"Before I watched this movie I had a certain bias as Jessica Tandy is one of my favorite actors ever... But I wasn't dissappointed. This is an excellent Hallmark movie. The plot is Jessica Tandy plays a woman who has lived in a rural area in the mountains in the south all her life. Her son played by John Denver is urging her to sell and live with him to have an easier and safer life- she is 79. Annie Nations (Tandy) still talks to her husband Hector played by real life husband Hume Cronyn everday and seems content. But things start to happen. A developer is pushing Annie to sell her land, her son's (Denver) is having family issues, and she wants to be with her grandchildren. Casting John Denver in this was a good choice. His music really adds to the movie and the beauty of the mountains is something special. Foxfire shows the choices that at some point we have to make in life- saying goodbye to what is familiar and loved to live somewhere else, and knowing when to let go and start another part of your life. Jessica Tandy is so dignified and real as Annie Nations. She won a well deserved Emmy for this role. The family dynamics are very real and watching Foxfire is time well spent.",1233273600,9,1197,4.348214285714286
1215166,5,B00000G07E,"Just wonderful.... I am from the area that this movie was filmed... The actors were the BEST...Its a movie that I have watched at least 10 or more times, and thinking about getting another dvd, because This is one of my VERY favorites.  I would recommend this to anyone....",1223596800,2,273,4.571428571428571
1215167,5,B00000G07E,"A charming Hallmark movie. The story is deep and endearing.

A woman living on her homestead is faced with the decision of either staying or selling. She visits with her ghost of a husband up on the hill where he is buried for his advise. Her son wants her to come and live with him. The ending is excellent and satisfying.",1219363200,3,323,4.295081967213115
1215168,5,B00000G07E,"I was lucky enough to see this on stage when Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy toured with it in the mid 80s (Keith Carradine had the John Denver role in that version).  Then I was thrilled that they turned it into a film so it would ""live"" forever.  It's a superb script and basically a three-person cast, who pull it off with such dignity and aplomb.  Its themes are universal and the story unfolds beautifully.  Rent it, buy it...do anything.  Just watch it!",1179878400,13,457,4.457831325301205
1215169,5,B00000G07E,"Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, and John Denver are great in this wonderful story of a elderly woman who loves where she is living. Even though a harsher environment than the city, she would rather die with what she is familiar than in strange new place. John Denver turns in a great performance as their son. If you enjoy Hallmark movies you will love this one. Most Hallmark movies are pretty good, but Tandy and Cronyn made this and ""To Dance with the White Dog"", and they are excellent. Many people bought the VHS, or enjoyed them on TV. Now you can get it on DVD.",1137456000,14,564,4.380952380952381
1215170,5,B00000G07E,"This video should appeal to every person that has a place, in their past, that remains in memory only. I originally bought the video because I am one of John Denver's biggest fans, but after watching it the first time I was  captured by the interaction of its three main charactors. The devotion and  love of Jessica and Hume brought a level of comfort and familiarity to the  pairing of ""Annie"" and ""Hector"". John wears his  character of ""Dillard"" as comfortably as he wears the jeans and  flannel shirts; as easily as he walks the mountain paths.  The old  homeplace provides a sharp reminder to all that happiness and success can  be found in the most humble of places. For many elders, the need to  maintain long nourished roots overshadows the desire for comfort and an  easier way of life. The need to remain amoung familiar and cherished  routines, and the fear of dying amoung strangers, is woven throughout the  film.  The team of Tandy, Cronyn, and Denver present a heartwarming  story of life as it was, and life as it is becoming for the people of areas  where the land is a harsh master.",930182400,76,1100,4.569230769230769

1215392,4,B00000G07E,"As in many movies adapted from stage plays, ""Foxfire"" is quiet and dialogue is important.  The writing is fine, closely woven.  The acting is splendid.  The movie is slow, serious, a bit sad, and very well done.

Unfortunately the color quality is not very good, and the DVD we borrowed has only closed captions rather than subtitles.

""Foxfire"" deserves a full five star rating on its merits, but my wife and I are unlikely to watch it often.  It calls for serious reflection.

Personal comment:  how tragic that Hector apparently never noticed the last chapter of the book of Proverbs (in the Bible).  But what a memorable character he is!

SPOILER?  One side of the love story finds its best expression in a single word during the interview.  It is one of the most moving moments in this film, or (I begin to think) in any film I have yet seen.",1405555200,,847,4.5364238410596025

1215397,5,B00000G07E,"I love the Hallmark movies, and this one holds a very special place in my heart. Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin are great, but i really love John Denver as the son. The three of them really made a classic that will last through the ages.",1395360000,,236,4.1521739130434785
1215408,5,B00000G07E,"I previously taped this show off the tv the first night it aired in the late 80's, but I missed the first couple minutes, and the recording was of poor quality, So now, I'm happy to have this DVD in my collection.  I love everything about this movie.  I'm not one to go into great detail like some of the reviewers on here, so that's all I have to say.",1392940800,,352,4.014285714285714
1215409,5,B00000G07E,"Frankly I doubt it, as they just don't make actors like Tandy and Cronyn any more - PS and oh btw, Denver is also a perfect casting choice and IMO every bit as important to this movie - his voice and playing not only fit this perfectly, but he's a highly underrated actor as well.  The supporting cast was superb too, though their parts are minor.  It's not only a wonderfully warm tale of family and love, but of the ""mountain folk"" of the Blue Ridge Mountains - a timepiece of a people and culture all but forgotten, especially in those older times.  It's tragic that movies like this are largely forgotten as well, while utter drek that gets by on special effects, gore, and/or melodramatic silliness make hundreds of millions.",1391126400,2,730,4.557251908396947
1215410,4,B00000G07E,"Unexpected nuances vividly brought to life by Jessica Tandy as Annie, the widow finally able to face the darker side of her marriage and the growing realization that clinging to the past is not really the way to fulfill her own needs at this time in her life. Her dignity and courage as she walks out of the shadow of her husband's strong personality is awesome. Love most of John Denver's music, but I think another actor might have done better with the role. Denver seems a little plastic in this. This is a film that bears repeat viewing to fully appreciate it.",1389484800,,564,4.485436893203883

He plays a part of a father leading his family into the wilds of the unsettled west.  Not bad, but more like a kids tale.  I enjoyed it, as the kid in me has not left compltely yet. (am a senior citizen).  This is a nice story and makes you think of how it must have had sooo many hardships in the past, for our ancestors to endure.  Was worth the cost and worth seeing over and over again, even for the scenery. John is made to look much older but still looks a-okay.

But what really makes this movie special are the incredible performances by Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, and the interaction between them. Though Denver can't compare to those seasoned pros, he does a decent job as well. This is a deeply moving, beautifully told story. I have watched it dozens of times, and cried every time. I wore out my home VHS tape and had to buy the video. Coincidentally, I now live in the mountains of Northeast Georgia, not far from the Foxfire museum and the place where the real Annie Nations lived. So now this story is even more meaningful to me.
