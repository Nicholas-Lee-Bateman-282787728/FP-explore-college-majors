8678166,2,B00NH34MGK,"Love Dance Moms, but Amazon evidently needs help with these ""DVDs made on demand"".... Happens all the time and not just this series.....",1456185600,,136,4.956521739130435
8678167,1,B00NH34MGK,I do not understand why season 3 is so very expensive?  Can anyone explain this?  I would love to purchase seasons 3 and 4 ... but not for over 50 dollars.  the other are inexpensive.  What is the explanation?,1451088000,2,209,4.282051282051282

8678170,1,B00NH34MGK,"This show is my fave and I want to buy all the seasons on DVD, but who in the world can afford to pay $120 for a single season of ANY show?!! REALLY, $60 for EACH VOLUME of Season 3? Does anyone know why??? Seasons 1 & 2 are both under $10. I honestly don't get it, especially since the show is currently airing Season 5. No luck on ebay ethier; they only offer DVDs for regions 2 & 4, which incidentally cost under $20. This sucks. Poor us, who can't afford cable are screwed! Also on Amazon Prime for movies (Video on Demand), they offer the different seasons for the strangest prices. Seasons 1 & 2 are like $10. Season 3 is like $50. Season 4 is like $25. So confused!",1432684800,3,672,4.098484848484849
8678171,3,B00NH34MGK,"I love this show, but I'm not going to pay nearly $60.00 for Volumne 1, then turn around and pay another $60.00 for Volumne 2,  ALL of the other seasons are either streamed to my computer for a price I can live with, or I've purchased a reasonably priced season. These girls are beautiful to watch, they have unmeasurable talent...too bad they don't leave Mommy at home.  These shows are highly scripted, I wouldn't watch this series if it wasn't for the talent of the girls.  I fast forward through Cathy...I might add I think the rivalry between Cathy and Abby may be made for TV enjoyment.",1431993600,2,592,4.514018691588785
