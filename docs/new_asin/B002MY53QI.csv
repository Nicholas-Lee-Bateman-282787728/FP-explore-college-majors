This video is the same exact format just shorter. About 6 minutes of a medium-speed song followed by another 5 minutes or so of a faster song and then the two minute boost at the end, rinse, repeat. Even the songs are the same with the exception of the warm-up and one other song that's used in the beginning of the second mile.

I took off a star for the wonky, inconsistent time clock as well. It's not there in the beginning and then shows up about 2 minutes into the warm-up and then at the beginning of the third mile is disappears and then suddenly reappears again. The form is supposed to be a 12-13 minute mile but it's hard to say since they couldn't get the time clock right. Matter of fact, on the third mile, it seems like it's only a 9 or 10 minute mile but I know that can't be right. Leslie needs to follow her video through the editing stage. This isn't the first video of hers where the editing and finishing touches were off.

So, basically, unless you've been on sabbatical (from exercising), you'll get the same aerobic benefit from this as you would just doing 3 random miles of her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-at-Home-5-Mile-Fat-Burning-Walk/dp/B001F12ISU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk</a>.",1340323200,19,1620,5.635245901639344
3953087,5,B002MY53QI,"I have a lot of Leslie's exercise videos.  I was a little skeptical because it's a 5K, and I really like to do 5 miles on her other workouts to get a good burn.  This one did NOT disappoint!  I think the miles per hour (beats of the music) is faster than on the other 5 Mile videos I have, so I felt that I had a great workout, and in less time.  Would highly recommend.",1330214400,4,370,3.8289473684210527
3953088,4,B002MY53QI,"I have a number of Leslie's workouts, and this is one of her more challenging DVDs.  If you know Leslie, she does all her badsic steps, but introduces 2-minute intervals of ""boosts""- higher impact jogging, kicking, and knee-lifting.  The intervals take place at the end of the miles, so you get three altogether.  I work up a great sweat each time I do the routine (and I'm happy that my downstairs neighbor goes to work before I exercise, so she doesn't hear my thumping around above her head).  Just one word to the wise for any busty ladies out there- you will probably want to wear a more supportive bra when you do this workout than you're used to wearing for Leslie's other workouts.  The first time I did this, wearing my usual ""Walk At Home"" gear, it came as quite a shock to my as to just how much bouncing I was doing.  Now, 2 new sports bras later, I'm boosting with the best of them.",1315353600,12,895,4.3293413173652695
3953089,5,B002MY53QI,This dvd is great for someone who is more advanced.  Please note I am 62 years old.  Each mile includes jogging and the entire tape is very fast paced.  I love it.,1314748800,6,163,4.03125
3953090,5,B002MY53QI,"This dvd is a must have. Leslie steps up her workout.....and although 5K is really only 3.1 miles.....it's worth it to add to your collection. If you haven't purchased her ""Slim and Sleek Walk"", you should look into that as well. She has added new steps!",1264291200,23,254,4.543478260869565
3953091,4,B002MY53QI,"Leslie's 5K was a fun walk with a few power bursts in the mix.  I chose this for the distance, a good alternative for rainy days =) In this dvd, it was just Leslie by herself. I prefer her instructing without 5-6 people in her group, she's too chatty.....it's like a SNL skit. My only complaint is the background.  It is too dark!!  A nice open, bright room with some windows would make a huge difference in setting the tone for the workout. I think her walks are an amazing way for anyone to get their bodies moving!  I highly recommend her dvds for beginners hesitant to getting in shape=)

To up the intensity a little, I wore weighted gloves (1 or 2 lbs), jogged more, and added more arm movements.  I was able to get my HR to 175.  Leslie's 5K with a twist is a wonderful dvd for all levels!",1260144000,38,796,4.197368421052632
3953092,5,B002MY53QI,I really enjoyed this workout.  I like the running and the fact this DVD keeps me moving throughout the entire workout.  The intervals are challenging and fun.  The music is great and fun to listen to.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone.  I hope Leslie continues making similar workout DVDs like this.,1252627200,25,304,4.660377358490566

8374208,5,B002MY53QI,"My present 100 pound weight loss is largely due to Leslie Sansone and her Walk at Home DVDs. I started off with the slower, easier DVDs in her series and gradually have worked up to a routine of doing this 5K on most days. This particular one I manage to do with my busy schedule. Unlike some of her other DVDs it features just Leslie, and no back up team, which I sometimes would go nuts looking at as I worked out.
This particular session is broken into three shorter timed segments, so if you want to you can do just one, two or all three parts. Or if you are crammed for time.do a couple in the morning, then finish later in the day. There is also a music only option that you can select, and then just follow Leslie's moves. None of them require jumping which I deeply appreciate. I can also know exactly how long the workout lasted, this is important to me. Usually I just keep the sound turned to off, and enjoy my talk radio shows as I work out, and the time flies by. Not that there is anything wrong with Leslie. She is very encouraging and bubbly, it is just my personal preference.
Bottom line : Go for it !",1395100800,6,1119,4.161290322580645
8374209,3,B002MY53QI,"I  thought that this was a new dvd.  It was made years ago and didn't  contain any new moves that aren't in the dvds that I already own.  Also, it has tried to freeze up and it has only been used three times!",1378166400,2,208,3.7674418604651163
8374210,5,B002MY53QI,"It's a bit longer than the DVDs that I do regularly, but I do like it.  The moves are different than the basic videos - there are intervals in which you perform a mild jog.  If you had told me I'd be jogging before I started using her videos, I'd have said you were crazy, but these jogs are not bad at all - about 90 seconds per interval and you can just walk if you wish.

Do love not having to learn dance moves that despite what the instructors say about using them on the dance floor would be very silly looking.  I just want to keep moving and get it done in 30 - 40 minutes time.  Very pleased!",1360713600,4,601,3.9338842975206614
8374211,5,B002MY53QI,I  was told by a friend about Leslie's walk videos. I was skeptical to buy a walking video because I already walk on my  treadmill. So before I bought one I borrowed the friends. I LOVED It! so I bought one of my own.,1356825600,,217,3.909090909090909
8374212,4,B002MY53QI,"I thought this one was a bit odd of a set up. Leslie does great in the actual workouts but every mile starts off with the warmup so if you want to do all of them you have the warm up to do first. This one is great if you want to split it up thru out the day. Great before work, maybe at mid day, after work and a late evening workout. Burn off all the meals you ate thru out the day.",1349481600,4,383,3.5714285714285716
