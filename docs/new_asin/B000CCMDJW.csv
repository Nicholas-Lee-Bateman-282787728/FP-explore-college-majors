8301471,5,B000CCMDJW,great music! Joaquin Sabina is a fabulous artist! one more time you can enjoy his music on a kind of unplugged show.recommended,1361750400,,127,4.818181818181818
8301472,4,B000CCMDJW,"Great performance! Sabina is one of the best poet-singers out there. His voice is going...although it has been going for the last 20 yrs...the band is great also. There are some errors made by Sabina/his band on a couple of songs which gives the impression that they did not rehearse this concert much...however, this is also their style. They project the feeling that they are just getting together to play music and what you see is truly what they are ""just"" putting together. I am not sure if that is intentional or not, but the result is just good music, amazing lyrics and a great time for the viewer.",1349395200,,606,4.568807339449541
