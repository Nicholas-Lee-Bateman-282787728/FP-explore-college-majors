8001910,1,B0000E69IU,"The only reason I even decided to get this DVD was because I found it (...) at Frys, and I came online to check out the reviews and everyone said it was worth getting.  Well, it's not.  The fact that Godsmack and Playboy ended up on the same DVD, and that there is no nudity whatsoever is pathetic.  If I'm not mistaken, this movie was taken directly from a TV special.  It's a really disappointing DVD.  You don't really get much from watching the band, nor do you get anything from watching the playmates.  Often times they tease you by describing something really naughty that the playmates had done (which they had taped), and they totally ruin it by showing you absolutely NOTHING.  The ONLY thing that would have made this DVD even worth buying would have been the entire collection of music videos.  Instead, they give you two (Voodoo and Straight Out of Line).  This is really just 45 minutes of pure crap.  Don't waste your money.",1095811200,45,939,4.535714285714286
