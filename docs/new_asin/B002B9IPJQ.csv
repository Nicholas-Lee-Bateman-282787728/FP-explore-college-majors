3892970,5,B002B9IPJQ,I highly recommend this. My son is autistic and these fill two things for me first because they entertain them second it is educational. they teach him things in an interesting way.,1365465600,4,181,4.6875
3892971,5,B002B9IPJQ,"The dvd was in perfect condition as described! My fifth graders loved it. It's funny & very educational, and has a convenient quiz included to help teachers on the dvd.",1364169600,,168,4.633333333333334
3892972,5,B002B9IPJQ,"Purchased these for my nephew who loves ""documentaries"" at the age of 6. So we decided to introduce him to Bill Nye. He was very excited to open them up. As my sister is a home school mom, these fit in with her science ""class"" and are a good school tool as well. I believe the DVD's are a little pricey if you want to own them all. But they are very well done.",1356652800,,360,3.8783783783783785
3892973,5,B002B9IPJQ,"Bill Nye is great.  And an episode on music and sound is just what my wife (a middle school choir music teacher) needs as part of her curriculum.
We've been looking episode for this via the Disney Movie Clubs and online.  Finally available again!  This was, I believe, Episode 99 and one of the last episodes of the show.
They just started rebroadcasting them locally, and I've DVR'd 33 episodes waiting to get this 'sode.  Now I'm going to order it if it is in stock from this retailer (Dec. '12).",1354838400,,498,4.43956043956044
3892974,5,B002B9IPJQ,Vthis was a great addition to my classroom.  My students love Bill Nye and tend to remember concepts better with the video reinforcement.,1341360000,,137,4.956521739130435

8360918,4,B002B9IPJQ,"Kids (age 4 and 6)  have loved their music classes and learning to play various little percussion instruments, so they found the scientific aspect of music very interesting.  Too  young to understand it all, but there was enough information there that they could absorb and ask questions about/.",1468195200,,295,5.104166666666667
8360919,5,B002B9IPJQ,Exactly what was advertised. Video was delivered in a timely manner.,1433721600,,68,5.2727272727272725
8360920,4,B002B9IPJQ,"I'm a substitute teacher and an amateur musician who reads music and plays a few instruments. I would say this video can be used as high as the 4th grade level and maybe at the beginning of fifth grade. Fifth graders might find it boring [or irrelevant, as they find many things :)  ]. Nye also gives a basic introduction to music notation in this video, which surprised me. I thought it would be more focused on the science of music and hoped he would go more in depth on sound waves than he did. I had also hoped for comparisons of sound waves of different instruments and to see differences in sound waves of the human voice singing different pitches. I am familiar with the old Bill Nye shows that my kids watched years ago on PBS. I have not seen many of these newer videos under the Disney label. When I ordered,  I had no idea what grade levels this video was geared to.",1431820800,3,877,4.27710843373494

8360923,5,B002B9IPJQ,Awesome depiction of the way an ear works.  My 3rd grade music class loved it!,1418083200,,78,4.2
8360924,5,B002B9IPJQ,"Students very receptive.  Students get to see a real Seismometer. Great humor, related video footage, and of course Bill Nye himself.",1397001600,,133,5.333333333333333
8360925,5,B002B9IPJQ,"I grew up watching Bill Nye and I'm so thrilled to see that my 3 year old is enjoying him, too! All of his DVD's are great. Interesting topics, creative experiments -- and a fun way for children to learn that science is everywhere!",1395187200,,231,4.2727272727272725
8360926,5,B002B9IPJQ,"I am an elementary music teacher and have used this with my students. They enjoyed it and learned many things about music, sound and the ear in a way that only Bill Nye can do. He is a great example of how a scientist can entertain too. There are a couple ""slow"" scenes in my estimation but the students who watched it didn't have the savvy to tell it was a little slow. Bill Nye has a little humor in his presentation for adults too and sometimes that goes over the kids heads but not to a negative affect.",1376697600,4,507,4.1313131313131315
