8022847,1,B00026L8WQ,"One thing I have never understood about Hollywood is how anything filmed after the early 1990s can be as visually unappealing as The Eliminator (2004). This film is just one in a long list of offenders, but the low-quality cameras nonetheless detract significantly from the movie-going experience. A good-looking film can sometimes make up for shortcomings in other areas, like acting, editing, etc.; a bad-looking film just exacerbates these problems, and that's exactly what happens in The Eliminator.

The story is simple: tycoons pit dangerous candidates (freedom fighter, martial arts expert, undercover cop, etc.) against each other and armed hunters on an island&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Most-Dangerous-Game/dp/1478256982/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Most Dangerous Game</a>&nbsp;style. The last one standing wins. The acting is poor, and the drama that should accompany such a dire topic as a life-or-death hunt is nowhere to be found.

Other instances of things going wrong in The Eliminator: Characters clumsily disengage from combat with or spare one another repeatedly even though the goal is to be the last contestant alive. Even though they have only a few rounds of ammunition, contestants use their bullets liberally. The word ""interrogator"" is spelled incorrectly on-screen. Every minority character is either killed off immediately or depicted as a savage. The sound is nearly as bad as the camerawork. And let's not forget the ridiculous soundtrack of stock riffs on the electric guitar!

I can understand being drawn to The Eliminator by UFC champion Bas Rutten's MMA skills or Michael Rooker's role, but neither is used to his full potential here. The fist-fights are the main attraction, but even these are poorly executed. It is true, there are worse movies out there- but not that many. Two stars for The Eliminator would be generous. Too generous. Avoid this bottom-feeder at all costs.",1387152000,,1967,5.661016949152542
8022848,3,B00026L8WQ,"Great set-up, based on a great short story, but really amounted to a Sci-Fi genre flick with a too-tiny budget. I love Michael Rooker in this, as well as Bas Ruten, but many of the others...well, let's say I urged their death scenes along.",1361404800,2,239,4.454545454545454
8022849,2,B00026L8WQ,"Bas Rutten is a true star in the world of competitive martial arts, a multiple-time champion with an admirable record, and has remained iconic following his retirement by way of a commentating career and several published works. Nevertheless, I don't really like the guy, and he's aggravated this by starring in the pretty bad DTV action vehicle you see here. ""The Eliminator"" - a hybrid of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Most-Dangerous-Game/dp/0780022114/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Most Dangerous Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Running-Man/dp/B0001932ZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Running Man</a>&nbsp;- isn't particularly worse than any number of low-budget martial arts movies but nevertheless stands as a solid reason why the former King of Pancrase didn't become the world's next action hero.

The story: an ex-cop (Rutten,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-Fury/dp/B0000DC12Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow Fury</a>) is kidnapped by a sadistic millionaire (Michael Rooker,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-Portrait-of-a-Serial-Killer/dp/B0009OUBC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer</a>) to partake in a deadly game wherein diverse militants are pitted against both eachother and trained assassins in a last-man-standing competition.

In addition to Rutten, martial artists like Paul Logan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballistica/dp/B003ZM81A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballistica</a>), MMA star Marco Ruas, Danielle Burgio (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Walking-Dead/dp/B0049P1VHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Walking Dead</a>), and stuntwoman Vicki Phillips (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X2/dp/B0000BWVCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X2</a>) play significant roles, reminding me of the Don 'the Dragon' Wilson style of casting. However, not unlike your typical Don Wilson movie, the utilization of these performers is questionable, since the fight scenes routinely disappoint. I had worried that boring grappling would constitute most of the choreography, but even though Rutten mixes things up with a good deal of roundhouse kicks, boxing, and judo maneuvers, the brawls are mucked about by sped-up footage, claustrophobic camera angles, and some cheesy sound effects. Sometimes the fights are just poorly written into the screenplay: football giant Jamall Duff (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Game-Plan/dp/B000YGGNM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Game Plan</a>) engages Rutten and Paul Logan three times but aborts the first two encounters by running away - the first time because of a temper tantrum when found out the rifle he was toting was empty. Rutten gamely allows himself to be beat up quite a bit, but neither he nor anyone else here looks particularly good.

The same can be said about the movie in general, way too much of which was created on a computer. An unwanted influx of green screen and computer-generated environment shots makes the entire picture look like a SyFy production. I figured beforehand that acting ability wasn't a requirement for the cast, but it was disappointing nevertheless to see a talented guy like Michael Rooker making a fool of himself. Bas Rutten does alright for his first starring role but manages in a romance scene to make Steven Seagal look like Rudolph Valentino by comparison. By the way, even though I'm all for relative realism, the way the mud stays smeared across the back of Rutten's bald head after he's been rolling around on the ground makes for a resoundingly bad look.

Obviously, not nearly all of the film's failings can be blamed on Bas (I don't think it's a coincidence that director Ken Barbet&nbsp;] hasn't found much work following this movie). Nevertheless, only die-hard fans will insist on purchasing this one. With superior MMA-inclusive flicks coming out of Hollywood these days on a yearly basis, you can definitely find this kind of action elsewhere and done much better.",1337472000,,4275,6.881918819188192
8022850,4,B00026L8WQ,"I did a mistake ""cos I didn't realize it comes without original cover, I guess I have to pay more attention..",1312416000,,109,4.238095238095238
8022851,3,B00026L8WQ,"This is the kind of movie that you can not take seriously and that is a good thing. I am a huge Bas Rutten fan and bought it for the sole purpose of seeing him in action. The movie has its share of good moments, bad moments and ""Why Bas why?"" moments.

  First, the good. Bas Rutten is perfect in this movie. The plot is not terrible, very straight forward but has its twists along the way. Is it predictable? Yes but you have to take this movie as what it is, not a Steven Speilberg epic but an action movie made to push Bas' career and it does that well. The action sequences are good too, made better by Bas using MMA (armbars, chokes and my favorite, a spinning kneebar from guard!) which were my favorite moments in the movie.

  The bad. The rest of the acting is not so great. Very one dimensional characters, but that is the nature of this kind of movie. The actors did their best with what they were given.

  The ugly. First, this DVD is not widescreen format. However, the film was shot widescreen and not reformatted to fit normal screens. So in the process alot of parts get cut off by the screen. It makes this movies production vales seem worse than they are. And they are bad to begin with, constant re use of footage of soldiers, skies and landscapes.

  If you buy this movie, get it to have fun and enjoy Bas. His fighting is great and he has an awesome love scene with one of the actresses (Bas takes what he wants!). It is the kind of movie to watch with friends and have fun.",1170892800,3,1497,4.195804195804196
8022852,3,B00026L8WQ,"Though `The Eliminator' (2004) can hardly be called an A-Class action flick, it is benefited by the presence of two actors - one is always underrated Michael Rooker ('The 6th Day'), and the other is Bas Rutten, Dutch fighter of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). At least Michael Rooker can act, and Rutten can fight like a real fighter, and his acting is not bad.

The plot is yet another retread of `The Most Dangerous Game.' (If you haven't seen this 1932 film, imagine a John Woo film `Hard Target.') It is about Rutten's character Dakota Varley, who is kidnapped and brought to the island to join a deadly game of cat and mouse. He and six other contestants are nightly hunted by men with rifle, and only the last man standing gets the reward of $10,000,000.

Michael Rooker plays (don't say again) rich and sadistic villain and organizer of the game. Though he is often typecast as baddie, he can show a much wider range of acting than is generally believed (see `The Replicant' or `Here on Earth'), but here he is strictly confined in a mold of a theatrical villain, without humor or anything special. The other actors are not particularly great though Paul Logan is slightly better than the rest of them, showing unexpectedly convincing portrait of rapport with Rutten's hero.

[ACTIONS ... NOT GREAT] But what we need is action, and action scenes of `The Eliminator' clearly need more money. From the opening lame, unexciting boat race, most of the actions fail to deliver the thrills and excitement, and though the fighting scenes of Bas Rutten are pretty good, they are buried among the weak script and inept direction that only gets worse as the film goes on. Apparently the island is much bigger than Manhattan, but the good guys can find a ""secret passage"" without even searching it.

As for the actions, `The Eliminator' deserves two stars or less, but I find Bas Rutten is good if not as good as The Rock and other action stars. He has made a promising debut, but the film itself is a letdown.",1154304000,,2000,4.641242937853107
8022853,3,B00026L8WQ,"If you love action, this movie is for you.  The movie stars Bas Rutten of Pride Fighting Championship fame.  Nuff said.

Btw, Mr Snub.  The Mexican that you refer to is the legendary Marco Ruas.  The trainer of UFC fighter, Pedro ""The Rock"" Rizzo.  And he's Brazilian.  Lol!",1128816000,,274,4.583333333333333
8022854,3,B00026L8WQ,"Filled with kinetic Matrix-like camera shots and tons of time lapse sky photography, THE ELIMINATOR is another one of those fight to the death movies we've been besieged with over the years.  In this one, for some reason, bad guy Michael Rooker (in a delightfully fiendish performance) recruits big bad Bas Rutten to participate in a fight to the death survival game on a remote island.  Other rich people have assembled their own warriors to escape execution from the guards on the island.  There aren't many surprises in the film, but Rutten is such an amiable giant that one can't help but root for him.  Paul Logan (Ultimate Fight) is along as a warrior who forms an alliance with Rutten to get off the island.  There's also a couple of inanely enjoyable shots of a bullet slicing through the air that is campy enough to be artistic.  Nothing new or exciting, but THE ELIMINATOR is passable entertainment.",1109116800,,909,4.75796178343949
