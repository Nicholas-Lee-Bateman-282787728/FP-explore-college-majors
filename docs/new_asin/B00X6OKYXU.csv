7159873,3,B00X6OKYXU,"I did watch a movie under this title.

It was about a rather psychotic truck-driver played by the ""Kenny""-an actor gained local star status for his character in a movie of Kenny a Plumber, who either supplied to or is used himself being a monster of local bush.

Apart factious horrors a work presents a very grim picture of Australian country-side outside international tourist routs.",1434153600,2,385,4.907692307692308
8715186,1,B00X6OKYXU,"Oh yeah, there is indeed Something in the Pilligia.  BOREDOM!  Man, this was a boring, boring movie.  I'm so glad that it's over.",1531008000,,129,4.521739130434782
8715187,1,B00X6OKYXU,"This was really a film about nothing. Seriously, nothing. It contained a lot of disconnected scenes of 2 obnoxious guys going from one place to another acting like 2 obnoxious guys wherever they went. There was a dog in there somewhere, too, I guess. And there were a couple of really crazy women who kept doing nothing but screaming mostly at one of the obnoxious guys. And then there were more scenes of the 2 obnoxious guys and the 2 crazy women spending endless hours driving around the bush, I guess it was, doing nothing. About the last 20 minutes, they decided to change tactics, so they got out of the truck and spent the rest of the movie just running through the woods in the dark doing nothing but yelling for one another, with one crazy woman continuously running back and forth to the obnoxious guy with the camera and screaming something and then going on ahead screaming more.
One of the most useless movies ever.  The End.",1530921600,,938,4.550295857988166
8715188,1,B00X6OKYXU,"Guy with the camera records:  Driving around.  More driving around.  Some nudity.  A bunch of partying.  More parting.  A bunch of arguing.  More arguing.  And more arguing.  There are lots of nice long shots of nothing but someones lap, the ground and so on.  Then constant running through the bush through the night while screaming usually with nothing happening except running and screaming.  Occasionally there is running through the bush without the screaming.  Never see any creature.  Not sure there even was one.  Was probably just that crazed guy with the sheep living in a shack out in the middle of what was supposed to be a national park. Never see anyone attacked.  Just see dead bodies and body parts and hear the occasional growl.  All filmed with one very shaky hand held video camera.  Take your Dramamine before watching this.  I've never understood how these types of movies get away with it.  Everyone around you is dying and you're running for your life, but you take the time to continue recording video through the whole thing.  I understood little of what they were saying, arguing and screaming due to the heavy Aussie accents.  Better turn subtitles on if you are interested.  Is this supposed to be a found footage film?  I doubt the guy who found the camera in the end had a chance to view the video or share it with anyone thanks to who I assume was the crazed sheep guy.",1529280000,,1400,4.647540983606557

8715190,1,B00X6OKYXU,"I think we got one glimpse at the creature, not enough to make out any details. The rest was just a couple of couples arguing and screaming and a little bit of porn in the beginning. I'm sure they put a lot of effort into it and I appreciate the effort but hopefully next time they will do better. Personally I am very tired of the 'scary' movies where there is a bunch of shouting and arguing going on. Not sure what the point is...they are stressed sure but does not help any movie. I feel it speaks to poor quality to have a bunch of arguing instead of real dialect/conversation.",1529020800,3,582,4.252252252252252
8715191,1,B00X6OKYXU,"Just dreck. 80% of the movie is extremely boring exposition, and the final chase sequences are just bottom of the barrel unbearable.

Worse, the characters are so god awfully annoying that they can't carry the film. I'm surprised I didn't turn off the movie just because of the main character's faux bad boy misadventures.

If you're looking for low budget monster in a suit found footage, Mount Nabi is the better film. And that film wasn't even that good. That's how bad this is.",1528156800,,481,4.714285714285714
8715192,3,B00X6OKYXU,"Only about the last 20 minutes was worth watching, and also when it finally made sense. I'm a huge fan of found footage, and I'll just about watch any of it, so I might be a little bias. The camera work and the acting weren't bad, the plot just needed a little more work.",1528070400,,271,4.037037037037037
8715193,3,B00X6OKYXU,Ok but you never see creature.,1527984000,2,30,4.166666666666667
8715194,2,B00X6OKYXU,"Yeah.. found footage, and nothing much in it. Seems like Australia is a piece of dump in this movie.",1527724800,2,100,4.315789473684211
8715195,1,B00X6OKYXU,"""There's Something in the Pilliga"" and ""Half Human"" are the same film. This is a found footage film taken in the Outback supposedly a Big Foot type of film. Dylan (Paul Denham) is the ride along filming Jay (Brendan Byrne) a self proclaimed redneck with a think Aussie accent mate. The accent was thick enough to make me look for an English subtitles option. Nope. None available. These two guys pick up two floozies at a bar on New Years Eve and drive into the woods....and we never see the creature. We hear screaming, have a lot of ground cam, running cam, shoe hurling chunks cam, and people dragged on the ground cam.  At one point the women try to act sexy for the cam showing cleavage and simulating sex. The lack of a decent ending killed the feature.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1454889600,4,793,4.462068965517242
