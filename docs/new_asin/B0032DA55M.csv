8463148,2,B0032DA55M,video poor quality . but what can you expect its an old video but nice to look back at toms start of  his  career,1411689600,,113,3.6666666666666665
8463149,4,B0032DA55M,"This will be a short one.  This does, indeed, have all the markings of a bootleg, but Tom has been pretty good about squelching those in the past, so maybe it's not.

It's a good,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foreign-Affairs/dp/B000002GYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foreign Affairs</a>/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Valentine/dp/B000002GWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Valentine</a>&nbsp;era Waits show.  It's great to see his laconic, hip, beat-poet-esque stage persona in a long-form format.  If you like early Waits, you'll enjoy this.

However, while the sound is just fine, the image suffers (hence, the possibility of a boot).  It looks like third-generation VHS, and that's not a good thing.

Still, like Twin Peaks, this is worth owning if you're a fan.

From the opening trumpet notes playing the refrain of Teddy Edwards' ""Little Man"" to the closing medley of ""Small Change/Hey, Big Spender,"" this is vintage Waits.  Very good stuff.

8463150,4,B0032DA55M,"This is an Austin City Limits performance from Tom around 1978.  This has been circulating as the most common Tom Waits bootleg outside of the Big Time DVD for many years.  When they decided to release this I had hoped they would do a little more work on the picture and audio than they did.  This appears to be sourced from the exact same TCR reel as the bootleg DVDs running around out there.  They did improve the sound by removing drop out and EQing things a little here and there, but nothing to major.  I think they could have done a lot better job with this DVD, he had lots of TV appearances back then that were only one or two songs, why don't we see any of those represented as any sort of special feature?  Why no warning that picture quality is that of a VHS?  Because it really doesn't matter.  If you like Tom Waits and want to see an amazing show from him, look no further.  This release was selected for the quality of the performance not the quality of the film or sound which might annoy some, but for the price I am okay with.  There are way to few video releases from this enigmatic master and I for one hope to see more soon, until then though.  If you want to enjoy a concert from the confines of your own home it looks like this is as good as it's going to get.",1294790400,,1284,4.116465863453815
8463151,1,B0032DA55M,"Who are these people who review these DVDs?  I like Tom Waits a lot and after reading all these stellar reviews I thought this would be a worthwhile DVD to add to my collection. After I received it I popped it into my DVD player and thought my DVD player had just gone on the fritz.  The picture was so bad that you could hardly see anything on the video.  The sound was almost as bad; just slightly above terrible. It looked like someone recorded it with a bad super 8 video camera and sounded like it was recorded with a $1.99 microphone purchased from radio shack.

Its too bad because this was a very interesting and rare performance of Tom in his earlier years.

Perhaps there was an earlier version of this DVD?  Otherwise I don't get all the positive reviews.",1281225600,4,766,4.359154929577465
8463152,5,B0032DA55M,This is a really good collection of some of tom's earlier work and it is the best wait's video available which brings me to the main point why don't they release more concert video. I know many other fans feel the same way. His latest tour would be great to see. I'd settle for a hand held videocam. thanks dennis,1272585600,,313,4.233333333333333
8463153,5,B0032DA55M,I loved this CD/DVD wether it was authorized or not by ACL or Waits. This is such a cool way to see Tom in his younger days. He's a hipster with the heart of a thespian!,1260316800,5,169,3.7222222222222223
8463154,1,B0032DA55M,This DVD is a bootleg of Tom Waits' Austin City Limits performance and is authorized by neither Waits nor ACL.,1257120000,10,110,4.55
8463155,4,B0032DA55M,"Great performances here, especially on the Nickel. It's interesting to compare this with some earlier performances, you can see he was starting to push himself away from the drunken street poet persona of his first few records. I don't know why Tom doesn't release more of his live stuff on video (Big Time is still not available on DVD)anyway it makes these old recordings a real treasure.",1253664000,14,390,4.835820895522388

I don't know but this may be legitimate product the cover is the only thing that gave me pause(Big Time photo for the Blue Valentine tour?).Its a pro shot great sounding concert that any Waits fan will enjoy.",1243468800,13,389,4.416666666666667
