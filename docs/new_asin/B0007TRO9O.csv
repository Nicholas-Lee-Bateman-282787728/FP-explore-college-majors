I'm sorry I didn't take the one reviewers advice and rent it, no, instead I spent thirty bucks on this piece of trash. All this video is, is some guys butts (you don't even see their faces half the time, but then would you put your face on this?) aimed at the camera and what appears to be farting. And a lot of laughing. I'm sorry but most of the farts in this so called movie seem to be fake, one part you can even see the guys mouth making the fart sounds. I can't believe I wasted $30 on this and I am going to see about returning it. I could have made a better fart movie with me and some friends. At least my farts would have been authentic. This was awful.",1255478400,,726,3.945578231292517
8051705,4,B0007TRO9O,"This is a documentary movie about a guy who tapes his ""farting"" for two years. This movie is quite hilarious and made a great DVD for my dad for Christmas.

I have to give it 4 stars because of the price and the length of the DVD. The DVD is about 25 minutes long and just about $30.00. I recomend buying it used or renting it for a good laugh.",1230940800,,344,3.914285714285714
8051706,5,B0007TRO9O,This movie changed my life.  It gives you a totally new perspective on life and the way we see the world through the eyes of others.  Sometime we just have to take a step back and really look inside ourselves to bring out the true human being that we are.  This movie really spread a whole new light on how i see and smell gas.  Im a changed man.,1229472000,,346,3.971014492753623

Incredibly creative and extremely funny.  A must-have for anyone who finds farts and farting funny!

I highly recommend this DVD!",1134172800,,263,4.4375
8051708,5,B0007TRO9O,"I laughed so hard, I almost pissed myself!

Loved it!",1133395200,,115,5.0
8051709,5,B0007TRO9O,"This is without a doubt, the most unique and hilarious DVD I have in my collection.  I have never heard (and seen) so many hilarious farts all in one collection.  This guy is amazing!

Lighting the farts on fire is fascinating...I never knew someone could actually do that!  The car scene with the ""power window lock"" made me laugh so hard, it made my stomach hurt.

I recommend this DVD for anyone who thinks farts are funny.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed!
