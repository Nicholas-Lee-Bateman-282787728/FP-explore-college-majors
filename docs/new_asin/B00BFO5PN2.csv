5614955,5,B00BFO5PN2,"***A few mild spoilers***

TOY STORY is perhaps the finest example of this swell premise, that, when the lights go out and the humans turn away, inanimate objects achieve a life of their own. And this is why puppets have always scared the crap out of me. WRECK-IT RALPH posits that when Litwak's Arcade shuts down for the day, then it's time for the characters that populate the various video games to let their hair down and mingle at Game Central Station, a communal site linked by interconnected power cables and nexus to all the video games in Litwak's.

""Hey, you moved my stump. I'm gonna wreck it."" That's motivation and intent from our main man, Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of an old school game called Fix-It Felix, Jr. Ralph is a big, ungainly guy with massive hands and feet, ideal for demolition. He stands at 9 feet tall and weighs over 600 pounds. If you put a quarter in the slot, he'll wreck the crap out of the Niceland apartment building, except that then the handyman, Fix-It Felix, Jr., repairs everything with a mere touch of his magic hammer.

Sometimes it's rough being the bad guy. When the work day's done, Ralph is still vilified while Felix is feted. While Felix is invited to parties at the Niceland penthouse, Ralph sleeps and sulks in the town's garbage dump. He attends a weekly support group for video game villains and confesses that, after 30 years on the job, he's tired of playing the bad guy, of being unappreciated. And if you've seen the trailer, then you've already grinned at the unsettled reaction from Clyde, the orange Pac-Man ghost. Determined to be a hero, Ralph sneaks into the recently plugged-in, first person shooter game, Hero's Duty. He's heard that Hero's Duty grants a gold medal to the winner. He believes that a medal will shake up the status quo back in Niceland. But things don't go as planned. Ralph isn't prepared for the grit and violence in Hero's Duty. Plus, it's hard to be the hero when all you know is to wreck things. Two other things he didn't think thru. If a character dies outside of the confines of his own game, he won't regenerate. Also, Ralph's absence is noted by the arcade owner who promptly puts the Fix-It Felix game out of order. This spells doom for the residents of Niceland. It's how folks like Q*bert became homeless.

Omigosh, Root Beer Tapper!! WRECK-IT RALPH is the 52nd Disney animated feature film, and this one resurrects your sense of nostalgia, especially if you were a kid of the '80s who spent his or her weeknights and -ends at the local video arcade. A huge chunk of the fun is from trying to catch all the visual references and the gaming injokes. (The sequence with the therapy circle alone is worth the price of admission.) But the film would've gotten tiresome if that's all it was. Thankfully, John C. Reilly, with his likable big lug screen persona, lends a really sympathetic voice as Wreck-It Ralph. The film's emotional core hinges on the unexpected friendship he forms with a misfit child named Vanellope von Schweetz. In the realm of the Sugar Rush kart-racing game, Vanellope is shunned because she's a glitch, an accidental programming. Nevertheless, she yearns to be a racer. She thinks she'll be a good one. She doesn't know how to drive. And now here's Wreck-It Ralph crashlanding into Sugar Rush in an escape pod.

Sarah Silverman, confounding my worst expectations, is endearing (and very sardonic) as Vanellope. Maybe it helped that she and John C. Reilly were now and then allowed to improv their dialogue. If you end up with a lump in your throat and maybe misting up, well, I was close to that. And two other noteworthy voice actors: Jane Lynch as the tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun who tracks a possible threat to Sugar Rush and who also drops some of the film's most colorful quotes and Jack McBrayer who is hilarious as the determinedly goody-two-shoes Fix-It Felix. And for the trivia-heads, that's Ed Wynn whom Alan Tudyk is channeling as King Candy. Good casting.

So, yeah, I'm pretty biased. This film dives straight into my wheelhouse, and I see no flaws. The animation is a seamless blending of the CG slickness found in the contemporary first person shooter game (like ""Hero's Duty"") and the more rudimentary rendered, pixel-obvious ""classic"" '80s game (like ""Fix-It Felix, Jr.""). The humor amuses on two fronts. Kids will laugh at the gags. Grown-ups will also laugh, but for grown-up reasons. WRECK-IT RALPH is highly recommended for those who relish vivid adventure stories that don't stinge on heart or nostalgia. I think I saw Dig Dug, as well.

Lastly, I loved the exquisitely animated lead-in short ""Paperman."" It tells the story of an office drone who tries to catch the attention of a girl by sailing paper airplanes across the imposing gulf of a busy street in New York from his office highrise to hers.",1351987200,7,4844,4.745843230403801
5614956,4,B00BFO5PN2,"I've been planning on seeing ""Wreck-It Ralph"" since the first trailer came out featuring Talking Heads' ""Once in a Lifetime.""  It was a clear message to Gen Xers that this was a movie for us.  The fact that it happened to be released shortly after my birthday made it a perfect opportunity to take my son to his first movie.  When we got there it was clear I wasn't the only one - there were several dads with their children in the theater.

""Wreck-It Ralph"" posits the question: does Donkey Kong like his job? When you make a living being a bad guy, does that make you a BAD guy? It's a timeworn plot that worked well for ""The Incredibles"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" - the plight of modern men who are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their lot in life.  In this case it's Ralph (John C. Reilly) who has a love/hate relationship with the people who live in the building he regularly wrecks and the hero who rebuilds it, Felix (Jack McBrayer).  Despondent over his unpopularity and low social status, Ralph decides to strive for a medal in another game with visions of returning home as a hero.

That game is Hero's Duty, a cross between Call of Duty and Halo. It's there that Ralph gets mixed up with tough-but-vulnerable Calhoun (Jane Lynch).  Ralph only gradually begins to understand just how much he has unbalanced the natural order of the video game universe when he ends up contaminating a racing game called Sugar Rush.

""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a sly nod to the 80s heyday of coin-operated console video games, when characters had lovable quirks like speaking a nonsensical language (Q-bert), limited movement (Felix), or served beer as a form of entertainment (Tapper). At various points during the film, we see the action from a two-dimensional pixilated perspective.  This puts the film in the right frame - it's all just pixels for our entertainment, after all.

""Wreck-It Ralph"" is not without its flaws.  There's a tedious romance between Felix and Calhoun, complete with flashbacks, that could have easily been excised.  The majority of the movie actually focuses on the hyper-adorable Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) in Sugar Rush, a setting which is more Candy Kingdom (from Adventure Time) than a video game -- adults looking for a heady whirl through other gamescapes will be disappointed.  Mostly, it's just too long, and all the kids in the audience got fidgety whenever there was too much dialogue.

The moral of the story seems to be that the job market is tough, your role is more important than you think, and you're better off being appreciated in your old job than going for glory in your new one.  Or maybe I'm simply reading too much into it.  My son thought the movie was ""okay,"" but then he's never played Pac-Man or Donkey Kong.",1351900800,9,2753,4.737945492662474
5614957,5,B00BFO5PN2,"From the start, it pays homage to my old school generation of gamers (but includes some new gen stuff as well), has a sophisticated and involving plot, non-childish humor, an outstanding sound track, and phenomenal character development. But that's just the surface.

What puts this animation a notch above most others in its type are the attention to all these details (of instance, the pixel characters in Ralph's game move in flash animation, no fluid animation, it's such a treat).

I won't spoil *any* of the story, because it *needs* to be seen, and not knowing any of it before hand, trailers aside, will be WORTH IT in the end. My title really is the theme of how I feel about this film.

I'm an emotional guy but wear a hard mask of apathy the vast majority of the time. This movie, at least for its duration, broke that mask into pieces. Go now. Watch it. You will buy it on Bluray if you have one when it comes out.",1351900800,4,926,4.435294117647059
5614958,5,B00BFO5PN2,"If you have any interest in ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" then video games more than likely played some sort of importance in your life at some point. The 3D computer animated comedy covers just about everything from Pong to Pac-Man to Super Mario Bros to first person shooters, 2D fighters, and racing games and everything in between. Prepare yourself for a nostalgic overload.

Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the villain who smashes buildings in a game called ""Fix-It-Felix, Jr"" and it just so happens to be the video game's 30th anniversary. When the arcade closes, the characters in each game relax, party, and even visit other games and characters through the power strip they're all plugged into. Ralph is sick of being the bad guy and being treated like an outsider while hero Fix-It Felix, Jr (voiced by Jack McBrayer) gets all of the glory. Ralph eventually starts game hopping to try and prove to everyone in his game that he's worthy of better treatment, but doesn't consider the consequences of his journey or the friendships he may make along the way.

Hopefully you have a chance to see this in theaters because the short, ""Paperman"" that's before the film is excellent. There's just something about animated shorts without dialogue that always seem to portray the story in a way that taps into your emotions in ways a traditional short just wouldn't be able to accomplish. ""Paperman"" has a man meet a woman at a train station on chance. They go their separate ways until he realizes she has a job interview at the building across the street. He spends the rest of the short trying to get her attention with paper airplanes. It's pretty creative and heartwarming.

What's so innovative about ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is that it puts you inside the games you grew up on. Seeing how the characters interact with each other when the arcade closes is the most entertaining aspect of the film. Game Central is pretty amazing because you get to see so many recognizable characters all in one place, but the Bad-Anon support group for video game villains is the highlight. Seeing characters such as Bowser and Doctor Robotnik listen to Clyde from Pac-Man as he gives advice to Ralph or witnessing Kano perform his heart-rip fatality on a zombie is like opening the door to your childhood.

The video game references are countless. Having M. Bison be the first to bring up ""going turbo"" was hilarious and seeing Ralph seek advice from the bartender in Tapper or King Candy (voiced by Alan Tudyk) use the Contra code to get into his secret vault was just amazing. Other concepts are just as brilliant such as the Nesquik sand scene and the Diet Cola Springs with falling Mentos. The comedy covers so much ground as it jumps from video game references to physical comedy (Jane Lynch's Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun punching Fix-It Felix, Jr in the face repeatedly) to the witty (Ralph hitting King Candy with his glasses after Candy put glasses on and declaring, ""You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?"" There's even some incredible food related ideas that utilize Oreos, Devil Dogs, and a particularly awesome scene where Ralph tortures Sour Bill (voiced by director Rich Moore) and references Tootsie Pops.

This may be the first time dubstep has been used in a major motion picture and it's actually fit the film. When Ralph starts battling (or fleeing) from the massive Cy-Bug attack in Hero's Duty, Noisia's remix of Skrillex's ""Bug Hunt"" plays in the background and actually makes the entire sequence even more enjoyable.

""Wreck-It Ralph"" is going to appeal to all ages whether you're a kid or a kid at heart. The younger audience can enjoy it for actually feeling like they're inside some of their favorite video games while adults can enjoy all of the throwbacks and references to the games of their past. Creatively written and downright fantastic, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" makes you think that an animated comedy this humorous, original, and entertaining has to be unhealthy. You should allow yourself to give into the honey glow though. This is the type of animated feature that will be great for generations.",1351814400,6,4119,4.852062588904694

5615045,5,B00BFO5PN2,a plus? I was an 80's arcade gamer and didn't know this game existed at all. I love the tie-in's to others of the more obscure games I did play. If you don't do animated violence beware that blaster battles against the cybugs are a big part of the mid-movie action and one of the heroines plays into the graphic-novel macho sexy woman thing that pre-teen boys seem to love...,1515715200,2,375,4.371428571428571

I never thought that video game bad guys would need a support group. How funny! I would say age 6 and under need an adult to explain what's going on. For instance, It's hard for them to understand the concept of a video game character jumping out of their game world and entering another video game world. Also, the glitch is a hard concept for younger children to grasp. Wreck-It Ralph is probably most enjoyed by ages pre-teens to adults.",1510704000,,558,4.375

5615091,4,B00BFO5PN2,"In a digital universe inhabited by arcade game characters, Wreck-It Ralph is the bad guy of his respective videogame Fix-It Felix. As such, he feels unappreciated by his good guy cohorts and seeks to do gain a hero medal from another game. He finds one in a first person shooter called Heros Duty, but takes it with him to a candy-themed racing game called Sugar Rush. There he meets a glitch character named Vanellope who feels just as isolated as he does. The two annoy the hell out of each other, but agree to help each other achieve their goals, Ralphs being to retrieve the medal and Vanellopes being to win the race. Standing in their way are the tyrannical King Candy and a virus bug from Heros Duty that swarms and multiplies.

The message of this movie is one weve heard time and time again, but it never gets old because we have to keep reminding ourselves of it. That message is to be yourself and be proud of who you are. Dont let the world bring you down and don't let anybody else define who you should be. If you want to be well-liked, do something admirable and leave the trophies and petty jewelry behind. A medal is a tiny coin, but a legacy is something that lasts forever. This whole movie is a journey for Wreck-It Ralph to find acceptance by doing what he does best: destroy things. He tried too hard to be the good guy and he ended up being a worse bad guy. As far as Vanellope goes, she too has a journey to go through that involves individuality. Shes spunky, sweet, and delightfully annoying, yet shes the most determined racer in Sugar Rush. Ralph and Vanellope are characters we can get behind as well as the others who support them like Fix-It Felix and the captain from the first person shooter Tamora Jean Calhoun. Thats what makes the message of the movie so special: relatable characters.

Another thing I must applaud this movie for his the creativity it took to make this movie. This could be considered fan fiction in some ways because it features M. Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter II and Bowser from the Mario games just to name a few. Granted, those are cameo appearances, but the movie still makes good use of them as part of a bad guy support group. The Sugar Rush videogame is candy-themed, so everything from the Laffy Taffies to the chocolate quicksand to the Mentos and Diet Coke lair is well-done, well-placed, and important to our story. Creativity also involves the various outcomes and high and low points of the movie, not just physical features. The big low point at the end will make you weep, the sweet ending will make you giddy inside, and the build up to both of those things will remind you of a brother-sister dynamic at home. When it comes to creativity, the makers of Wreck-It Ralph left no stone unturned and made sure the audience went home happy.

Speaking of making everything click, the storyline actually makes sense considering all of the variables in this movie. Whenever a game glitches or has a character crossover, the arcade machine is out of order and pulling the plug on it will erase the entire game. Theres a train station connecting all the games together via the power strip and its various cords, which is important for keeping everybody in order and with their own games. Crossing over is actually a huge no-no in this world, which is no more evident than when Wreck-It Ralph accidentally leads a virus bug into Sugar Rush and all of his friends have to come rescue him before it multiplies. When you have a movie with this many loose ends, it needs its own set if strict rules so that it doesnt become too unbelievable. I commend anybody who can maintain order with this much chaos going on.

If you're looking for an enjoyable movie for the whole family, young or old, be sure to watch Wreck-It Ralph. Older audience members will have retro-grade nostalgia for these arcade games. Younger audiences will enjoy the quirky characters and their silly jokes. Film critics will love how everything clicks together and nothing is left unattended to. It shouldnt come as a big surprise that this movie won a boat-load of awards and was the 14th highest grossing film of 2012. A passing grade will go to this piece of 3D animated joy. How does that sound?",1507420800,,4235,4.568421052631579

5615187,5,B00BFO5PN2,"I will be blunt: I had very low hopes for this film. Disney decided to bribe Pixar a huge amount of $ to keep their name brand on their films but they wanted to make their own 3D cash cow films. Chicken Little simply ruined the book and Disney was getting paranoid after the tepid sales of animated films in the early 2000's.

After being blasted with poor reviews, I wasn't sure Wreck-It Ralph would be worth my time. I didn't see it in theaters but I did see it on tv. I must admit, the movie is great. It is rather original in that it takes place in a video arcade where every evening, videogame heroes and villains enter a common terminal and mingle. Ralph however suffers from an identity crisis. His videogame is very old (aka not cool anymore) and he just happens to be the bad guy that every character in his game despises.

Tired of being the hated underdog, he decides to infiltrate a 3D big budget alien combat game and steal the winner trophy. The problem arises when he brings an alien egg with him and ends up trapped inside of a big budget 3D car racing game. He befriends a fellow outcast named Penelope and proves that he is a good guy afterall. With lots of threats occuring with the alien bugs causing havoc and unexpected friends & foes in every corner, Wreck-It Ralph is a story that doesn't rely on dirty language or excessive violence that will entertain older viewers.

I sincerely hope the long awaited sequel will be just as good.",1492214400,,1456,4.405204460966543

5615209,5,B00BFO5PN2,"This is a movie we bought at a time when things were very crazy in my life, so I didn't get around to reviewing it then.  But because I sent some negative vibes Disney's way about their most recent movie, Moana, my soul needed to keep things balanced and support a movie of theirs' that I love deeply.  We've seen this hundreds of times in our house because it is one of my son's favorite movies, so I've had a ton of exposure to it, and I still love it.

I like that this is one of their original stories, and as a story, it is creative and gets high marks for emotional impact.  I struggle more when a movie recreates someone else's story less then faithfully, or if history or cultural traditions are represented incorrectly.  This movie doesn't do any of that, which I love.

Two of the central characters in this, Ralph, and Vanellope, are both dealing with a deeper kind of problem: how do you find meaning and joy in your circumstances if the people around you think of you as only the bad guy, or that you cause nothing but problems?  Ralph's story arc in particular I love, and it still makes me tear up in the end when he's plunging towards diet cola mountain and saying ""there's no one I'd rather be than me.""  And some of the dialogue from the supporting characters is just awesome...""Doomsday and Armageddon just had a baby and it is ugly!"" is one of several classics from Calhoun.

Calhoun is a character you'd think I'd have objections about based on the way she's drawn, but I don't...though some women might.  So she's in your typical video game slinky gear, blown up size bust, wasp waste...pretty objectified.  But this isn't a movie that claims to have any sort of improved or elevated way of presenting women at any sort of size, and since it doesn't claim that, I can't hold it to the higher standard of offering something and then failing to deliver it on another level that would otherwise be required in my book. And really, all they are doing is holding up a mirror to what is seen in the gaming world.  I feel like the treatment of men and women in this movie is consistent in the way they are presented, so I actually find that doesn't raise any of my feminist dander.

As a cautionary note, when we first saw this movie, our daughter was 7 and she was scared by the scenes with the robotic bugs and didn't want to watch it again for a while. She loves it now, so this is one of those where knowing your kiddo may be important, because some younger ones may be scared by those scenes.  Overall though, we love this movie, and in particular, I love that Ralph is a bigger character.  For our son, who has a rare form of gigantism, I often wonder if that isn't why this is one of his favorites, because maybe sometimes this is how he feels when he's in a room of other children his age.  And I like that he has something he feels he can relate to, and I really love the quality of the story and animation in this movie.",1487894400,2,2945,4.307971014492754

Parents who are a bit strict on ""bad words"", I use that term loosely cause I personally don't think ""moron"" is a bad word but I'm not a parent so I can't judge, than maybe this isn't suited for your children below the age of 5, especially if they have the habit of repeating everything they hear.

5615264,5,B00BFO5PN2,"This really is one of the better of Disney's more recent movies. It is very imaginative and very innovative in its story line. The way they dealt with all the video game characters and the whole world surrounding video arcade games really made a great story. Much of the fun involved with this movie is the almost infinite number of cameos of past video games characters and all that involved the games and their interplay. The story writers were absolutely brilliant the way they dealt with the video game world and the main story line they used to bring it all together. Really a very entertaining, very good movie to watch. I'd see it again and again. Great work, great job!!!",1483488000,2,679,4.619834710743802

5615275,4,B00BFO5PN2,"Wreck it Ralph is basically a fictional video game character similar to Nintendo's Donkey Kong Character, originating from the classic arcade games Rampage and Donkey Kong with Ralph as the main protagonist villain character.  I knew from the previews that I was going to enjoy this movie no matter which way the plot ended up going.  Just the premise alone of a famous villain tired of being the bad guy wanting to change his role in the universe was an original idea out of Hollywood for a change.  One of those You had me at hello type of moments.  Being a kid during the golden age of arcade games I have many fond memories of the games in this movie that came and went over the years.  It was fun to see such classics as SF2, Q-Bert, Pac-Man, Pole Position and others.

Similar to the live action animated movie Toy Story Wreck It Ralph gives us a behind the scenes world of what happens when the outside world goes to sleep and the characters from the game come to life similar to Night At the Museum and Monsters Inc.  There seemed to be a Grand Central Station type of hall where all the characters move back and forth between game worlds.  Right off the bat it shows us that Ralph is a decent guy and has compassion for Q-bert and others who have lost their game.

Ralph is bored and lonely and tired of all the adoration shown to the hero of his game Fix It Felix who is basically a Mario wannabe.  Ralph gets no respect or appreciation from anyone and is made to live outside the apartment building world in his own game.

The group therapy scenes for villains is such a classy little part in the movie.  You can really get the heart of the film how alone and unappreciated Ralph is in his game.  None of the other characters in his own game appreciate his feelings at all.  All he wanted was to be invited to a 30th anniversary party for his own game, to be accepted and have a piece of cake.  Like Ralph says in the movie they invite Pac-Man but not me.  That moment leads to a confrontation with the other characters from his game and sets the movie in motion and sends Ralph on his quest to become a hero.

The movie has a lot of good values as the friendship develops between Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz and is an entertaining film to watch.  Mario Kart fans will love the Candy Racing game in the film.  The same can be said about first person shooter game fans with Heros Duty.  I was surprised to see cameos by Bowser and Sonic the Hedgehog but no Mario, Luigi, Princess or Toad in the film.  More so not to see Donkey Kong since it was an arcade staple and Ralph appears to have so many of Donkey Kongs traits.

Overall the movie is good and memorable with several funny scenes.  It has a few scary moments for young kids but for the most part appropriate for everyone.  I would rate this movie a high 4 stars.  Buying price should be no more than $12 to $15 but well worth it for the nostalgia alone.",1482883200,,2926,4.276363636363636

I'm in my 30s now. I have a kid and I grew up gaming in the NES, Genesis, and arcade machines. This film has a lot of novelty to it and a lot of allusions to things I grew up with which makes it both fun and familiar. I took my daughter to see it in theaters so when a digital copy came up I had to get it.

All in all its a film about being ok with being a bit different and that sometimes you gotta be the bad guy in a situation even though you're not a bad guy.

Well written, cute, and all in all a lot of fun if you're like me and can relate to the games and help bridge a bit of old with new.",1482019200,7,605,3.5338345864661656

Lots of zingers in there for parents, lots of colors and pace for children. And the fact that they end up in a world made of candy doesn't hurt.
Streaming is smooth on a day that streaming is smooth. We use a wii which also has hulu and netflix. Somedays the other two work fine, no problems. Other days, the video keeps loading and stopping to throw up various error codes. Like the day I purchased it...the movie stopped no less than 10 times with an error message. Whereas yesterday, it played straight through. I'd love to blame it on my internet, but hulu and netflix work just fine on such days. Sometimes Amazon video just goes wonky.

The dialogue is cool and well-written, and it seems enjoyable for kids and adults. Since I love video games, and have since the early 80s, I got a lot of the jokes.

I could watch Nemo, Beauty and The Beast, Tarzan, all the Toy Stories over and over; but this one was a one timer. I would not add to my Disney collection at all.

5615550,5,B00BFO5PN2,"I'm biased, because I'm a lifelong gamer. Even if you're not, this movie is super fun and in my opinion has some of the best voice acting in an animated movie. John C. Reilly is the man, and Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch provide stand-out performances.
Ralph is the bad guy in his video game, but he really wants to be a good guy. He travels to a different video game to earn a medal in the hopes that people will treat him better, but he messes everything up and puts the whole arcade at risk from a virus cybug. He wrecks just about everything, but learns how to fix things with help from his friends. That sounds a bit like a hippy song, but so what.
Also, it's pretty cool to see a bunch of characters from video games as the supporting cast. That makes an awesome movie even cooler.",1466035200,,788,4.225165562913907

5615552,1,B00BFO5PN2,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

That means ""Parental Guidance Suggested  some material may not be suitable for children."" So before you hang Disney up by it's toes for ""destroying the Disney image"" please realise that you simply don't know how to follow the directions on the box. And for those who think Disney is all teddy bears and cuddles, and that certain imagery is too much for your delicate child, please, I urge you to rewatch the ""classics"".  Let's see in Cinderella her ""evil"" step sisters cut off their tier toes to fit the slipper. In the little mermaids original story, she doesn't get her voice back in time and dies, in sleeping beauty, snow white is poisoned by a scary old witch, then the price kills the queen. Lion king mufasa is murdered by his uncle, Hercules is poisoned by Hades who then sends a woman to seduce him, uh, babies mom is killed by hunters, old yeller gets rabbis and is shot, in Shrek Farquat is eaten alive and everyone cheers.

5615584,5,B00BFO5PN2,"This is one of the greatest movies Disney released recently. It's a wonderful story about a videogame bad guy (John C. Rielly) who wants more out of life, and tries to be the hero for once. In the process, however, he ends up accidentally releasing a force that threatens to destroy his world, and he must try to stop it. At the same time, the hero of his game (Jack McBrayer) tries to find him and bring him home before their game is unplugged. Along the way, Ralph meets the little candy-coated glitch with a snarky attitude but a sweet heart from the Candy-themed racing game Sugar Rush, Vanellope Von Shweetz, (Sarah Silverman) and the kick-butt commanding officer of the First Person Shooter Hero''s Duty Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch). It has many great messages, including loving yourself and how wrong it is to bully and put people in boxes and judge them, and that friendship is more valuable than winning.

This has something for everybody. It has a great story, wonderful acting and BRILLIANT music by Henry Jackman.  There's also lots and lots of wonderful details throughout this amazing videogame world they created, including tons of videogame character cameos and references all throughout the movie. It has action, adventure, surprising plot twists, a wonderfully believeable world, great characters, comedy, a nicely woven romantic subplot, and a wonderful friendship at the heart of the film. If you're a Disnerd, a videogame nut, animation nut, an adult or a child,  You will love this.

Fair warning, though: The Cybugs in Hero's Duty may be a bit scary for very young children, and there is some rude humor and cartoony/videogame style violence and perilous scenes you'd expect from a world of videogames. But nothing too bad, though. There is definately alot for all audiences: kids, teenagers, and adults alike.",1464307200,11,1834,4.983660130718954
