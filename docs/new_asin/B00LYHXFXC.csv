6516688,4,B00LYHXFXC,"The premise is that in the near future there is a new cold war between the Eastern bloc and the West. The action takes place in J-country (Japan obviously due to map) and it is reminiscent of the two Germanys during the first cold war. Both sides have presence in the country, vying for influence. Mayuko Iwasa plays agent 009-1, a cyborg operative for the agency allied to the western cause. Plenty of action and plot twists and about as believable as a Bond film. A good film but one never sees her secret weapons though it's made obvious that she has chest guns. Hot action heroine-check. Diabolical villain that wants to nuclear strike both sides-check. Agency that leaves it's agent without backup-check. Regenerated undead soldiers- wait what?

The last plot point was really a surprise spoiler but the writers seemed to have needed something for the next to last battle before the two cyborgs fought their climatic battle. The film has good fx and is not low budget fare. 2013 film. Hopefully a sequel will be made soon. Beware Number Zero.",1431907200,14,1047,4.752747252747253
6516689,4,B00LYHXFXC,"This review is based on the Japanese Anime version of this film. The anime is very good and has become sort of a cult series introducing lead female character Mylene Hoffman, an agent of the all-female ""Nine Nine Group"", one of the ten groups in the ""Zero Zero Organization"",a Western Bloc Intelligence Organization.. Almost all of her body has been cybernetized and various parts of her
body are equipped with special functions which are necessary for spy activity. The premise is based on ""What if the Cold War had lasted 140 years."" She and her fellow spies fight against the Eastern Bloc's  ""S"" Area agents. The anime has three volumes detailing the epic battles between the Western and Eastern Blocs and comes packaged in a metal brief case with the raised 009-1 lettering. The anime runs 325 minutes with 12 episodes. I'll be buying this live action version and then doing a review so watch this space. Available in anime on DVD through Amazon for almost $400.00! (The name of this movie should be ""009-1: End of the Beginning""",1415750400,4,1033,4.770949720670391

8669055,4,B00LYHXFXC,I saw this on Amazon Prime and so I can't comment on the DVD or packaging. The film is based upon the 2010 (?) Anime 009-1 which featured Mylene Hoffman the sexy cyborg with weapons in unusual places. In this live action film Mylene Hoffman is played by Mayuko Iwasa who doesn't resemble the cartoon figure in any way whatsoever. The plot of the film follows the basic story arc of the anime and does a good job of bringing the anime concepts to life. The action sequences are good but some of the blood splatters are too Japanese B-Movie and don't fit the film very well. The action sequences are good and the film hangs together well. It's not the same as the anime but a good attempt to bring it to life.,1485561600,6,707,4.2835820895522385
