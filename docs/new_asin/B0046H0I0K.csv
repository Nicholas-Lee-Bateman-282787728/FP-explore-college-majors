4268369,1,B0046H0I0K,"This movie is boring, its main character carries a head around most of the movie for no reason, he never uses a sword like on the cover, he's flat and has no personality, there's too much close ups in this movie and the action scenes are average but not really worth seeing. Skip this movie, it blows. 1/10",1308009600,,306,4.293103448275862
4268370,4,B0046H0I0K,"This marks (Jacky) Wu Jing's directorial debut, where he plays hired killer Bo Tong Lam, stranded on an island near Hong Kong, immediately after the fresh kill of a triad boss.  He seems content minding his own business, waiting for the storm to pass, when he prevents an accident involving an attractive female officer (the captivating Celina Jade, soon to appear in the RZA's ""Man With the Iron Fists"").  They are having a nice lunch (presumably @ Long John Silvers) when she gets a radio call about 3 suspects, matching the description of some fellow diners.  The apprehension attempt does not go well (these dudes are huge) and Bo reluctantly helps her, garnering more unwanted attention from the police who welcome him at the station as a hero.  Will he make it off the island before the cops discover his identity and/or the triads find him?

Well, I was one of the few who liked the teaming of Wu Jing with choreographer Nicky Li in ""Fatal Contact"" (2006).  Hey, I like good fights, and in my opinion, ""FC"" has some of the best, in exactly the manner I like 'em: fast, precise, fluid, and brutal, with long takes and few wires.  Unfortunately ""FC"" also has a boring plot with (mostly) unlikable characters.  ""Legendary Assassin"" is a (slight) improvement in the plot and character department (except for the insufferable Sammy Leung) but the fights are definitely a step in the WRONG direction.  Are they awful?  No, but they're extremely disappointing when considering the main duo involved.  I always complain about wires but I actually don't mind them when they're not blatantly obvious.  They should aid fight scenes, not star in them!  The wire-work here is better than most, but that ain't sayin' much.  Acting's about the same, which is not great but functional, though it should be noted that my cinematic passion lies in action films, where thespian chops are typically neglected or ignored completely.  Wu Jing is an improving actor and AMAZING athlete who even shows potential as a director but needs better roles if he wants to be an international star.

Anyway, I debated about the rating.  It's probably more like a 3.5 out of 5, but I asked myself a couple of difficult questions:  Did I like it?  Will I watch it multiple times?  Yep and most likely.  The DVD from Lionsgate certainly doesn't hurt with an excellent widescreen picture and a handful of standard special features.  In Cantonese or English with optional subtitles available in English or Spanish.  The biggest surprise of this flick is the ""Seasonal Films"" logo, present at the beginning of the movie!  I thought they went under? With half their library remaining unreleased on DVD, a comeback would certainly be encouraged by me!

4268371,1,B0046H0I0K,"You want some Wu Jing We got him, which is all this dvd can claim. The cover has him holding a sword so i figured he's going to use a sword, but he never does, he never even lays his hand on one. SO, false advertising right off the bat.

I rented it for free from redbox and still could barely watch it over 2 days in separate 30 min sessions.
Its really the worst of HK film now a days. No plotting, terrible story, bad acting, poorly constructed 1/2 dimensional characters, bad action, lots of wire work. The fight and action scenes are flat out stupid.

The only thing of note were the cooking and eating scenes which came off as pretty realistic.

Check out Tai chi master 2 Fatal contact or invisible target if you want real Wu Jing, the true spirit of HK film, and blistering action.",1299110400,6,789,4.246666666666667
4268372,4,B0046H0I0K,"If you're looking for a movie that is Academy Award quality, you're in the wrong place.  But if you're in the mood for a cheesy but kick-ass action flick, Legendary Assassin absolutely delivers.

I love deep movies that make you think. But like any red-blooded man, sometimes I just need an adrenaline-pumping action movie.  This film offers great fight sequences, sprinkles of intentionally corny humor, and bone-crunching action.  The fight scenes were choreographed by Nicky Li, an official member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team for over 15 years.  If you've seen Rumble in the Bronx, Rush Hour, or any other Jackie Chan flick, you've witnessed Li's fight choreography.

The film was shot surprisingly well, and has a terrific music score.  I was impressed with the fact that this was the directorial debut of Wu Jing AKA Jacky Wu, who also plays the lead character Bo, a soft-spoken stranger who carries a mysterious bag everywhere.  Legendary Assassin also marks the acting debut of the amazingly beautiful Hong King singer Celina Jade, starring as small-town police officer.

If there's any drawback to the movie, it's that there is virtually no character development or backstories.  While most of the film's characters are memorable, and have their own unique vibe, you really don't get to learn anything about them.  There's not much to the plot itself, and even Bo's motive for being an assassin isn't revealed until the film's conclusion.  But despite that minor frustration, there's also a small twist revealed in the final scene that I was totally surprised to have not picked up on earlier in the film.

The film was shot in Hong Kong, and the dialogue is Cantonese with English subtitles.  The DVD extra features include two short featurettes: The Making of Legendary Assassin, and The Characters of Legendary Assassin.  The ""making of"" feature offers great insight as to why the lead character wears a wolf fang around his neck, and also provides details on the actors and production.

Overall, I thought this was a great action flick.  It was intentionally shot to be kind of corny like an 80's martial arts movie, but the fight scenes definitely deliver.  If you're a fan of Jackie Chan flicks, you should absolutely check out Legendary Assassin.",1293667200,8,2263,4.989333333333334

4268423,5,B0046H0I0K,Wu jing is the most under rated martial artist he's also a good actor.this was written and filmed well. while there's a little comedy in this but its a romance movie with lots of bone crushing action with an intelligent plot.. the only stupid thing about this was the cover art,1405814400,,277,4.450980392156863
4268424,5,B0046H0I0K,"I am pleased with this first Jacky (Wu Jing) picture from beginning to end. An assassin (Wu Jing) as Bo Tang Lak  has a job to do and gets waylaid. Everything is explained sufficiently to expect the well-choreographed fights and the manhunt for the killer(assassin) on the loose. His escapes at every turn surprise as much as his martial skills. The coincidental assistance from the local police (and the love-interest) officer (Celine Jade; a Sally Kellerman resemblance) was natural and a wonderful respite from the building body count. Here, the story expands to allow some heart to enter, an unusual plot device that works long enough to provide entrapping the wily assassin in an all-out fight against tremendous odds at the climax, who sees another day. Actually, the character of Bo Tang Lak owes much to the noir work of Alan Ladd, except that he used a gun and his fists. The plot was not as thin as some suspect; it was well-trod by the likes of Ladd or Clint Eastwood.",1395619200,,979,4.7251461988304095

4268436,5,B0046H0I0K,"I loved this movie because it showed a different side of Jacky Wu Jing.  The fight with the 100 was great. I just wish that the ending was different.... other than that, I love this film.",1387152000,,187,4.194444444444445

4268443,1,B0046H0I0K,"The box art and trailer and even the title imply a dark brooding film in which an assassin takes revenge. instead it's a sub par goofball pseudo comedy, that is neither funny nor entertaining. The box art succeeded in being totally fallacious, as it does not reflect the nature of this garbage at all. Hideous, lame and even the pastel color schemes used by the production designer all serve to make this the ultimate headache. Wish i could get a full refund.
