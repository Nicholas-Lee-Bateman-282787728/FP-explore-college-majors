4099938,5,B003A7VXSS,When i watched it i didn't notice it was 4 hours long until i looked at the clock after the movie was done! It doesnt even seem like 4 hours when you watch it...theres not not even one boring part in the movie like really long movies usually have. The movie acually seems short to me i wish there was more. This movie is like no other movie i have ever seen its one of a kind i cant even compare to any other movie. If you like weird and different this is the movie for you. I loved it! The subs are perfect too!,1353110400,4,512,3.8857142857142857
4099939,5,B003A7VXSS,"A brilliant farce, metaphorical oddysey that is as ambitious as it is bizarre. Do not be swayed by the running time. Those four hours dissapear instantly. Highly recommended!",1346457600,5,174,5.25
4099940,5,B003A7VXSS,"At first glance, one might think this movie to be a bit long, but once you get into the movie, you hardly notice the time at all. The incredible care, and detail put into the story make this one enchanting, seriously psychologically messed up piece of cinema. I rate this 5stars for the amazing story and drama, and how well it was produced. Sono-sama is definitely a master. I would recommend Suicide Club, Noriko's Dinner Table, and Strange Circus all by Sono-sama and the Korean film Old Boy",1329696000,11,494,4.625
4099941,5,B003A7VXSS,"Very interesting movie.  The movie is 4 hours long but it was never boring.  It had a combination of suspense, love, comedy and drama.  There were some violence and sexuality but unlike other Sono movies, they were not graphic.  The story may be too controversial for a Hollywood movie.  Highly recommended.",1328140800,4,307,4.9411764705882355
4099942,5,B003A7VXSS,"First of all, Sion's movies are all brilliant and the fact that they are very slowly trickling into the US is a bit annoying. One scan of the internet (including IMDB and Sion's home page) will confirm that Sion has a massive list of movies under his belt, with more coming, and so far I can only find seven of his movies on DVD in the US. It took us late into 2011 before Love Exposure (released in Japan in 2008) was even released as a US region code DVD, and even before that it was hard to find at all, let alone for a fair price, in other region codes. A three year wait for a hot commodity? Someone is sleeping on the job.

Oh, but you wanted to read about the movie right?

Love Exposure, like all Sion movies, is impossible to learn about from reading the back of the box or any review anyone can write about it. The basic description is something like this...

Yu becomes tired of fabricating sins he didn't commit in order to please his father, a crazy priest who reprimands Yu whenever he DOESN'T do things wrong. So Yu starts committing every sin he can, joining a street gang and eventually, to really prove to his dad he's a sinner, becomes a peek-a-panty photographer. Things become complicated when he meets his dream girl, Yoko, in the midst of a street fight and now must win her heart.

Yeah, ""things get complicated"" alright. That's the understatement of the century. After all of the above happens we still have about three hours left in the film. Let's just say Yu's ""I want to sin so I can confess"" perspective gets him into a fair bit of trouble, not the least of which is drawing the attention of a cult promoter who takes a special interest in him.

And all the while, Yu keeps his focus on Yoko, despite everything that happens to him as a result, including her relentless scorn toward him, which only increases as he tries even harder to win her over. But will he succeed...?

Yep. It's a love movie. Love is not an alien concept in Sion's movies but in this one it is the thread that connects everything that happens through all 237 minutes of the film. This is 237 minutes without a single dull moment, mind you, so if you're adverse to watching a four hour film just free up your schedule and go for it. It's worth it.

American romance movies, suck on this. Oh, and I'll take more Sion movies, please and thank you.",1325462400,12,2347,4.344748858447488
4099943,5,B003A7VXSS,"Standard movie runtime has been universally accepted at 90 to 120 minutes. Expand beyond that and you better give up the goods -- robots, or war, or time travel, or stories of unrequited transdimensional love triangles. But a 237 minute movie about the art of upskirt photography? Now that's bold. Such is the case with Love Exposure, a 2008 film by Sion Sono that has charming topics like lust, religion, and coming of age in a world where being a panty shot photographer is a normal thing. The film has had a long run of success at festivals, but its odd topic and story have kept it from reaching any audience in America -- until now. It is now on dvd and I would urge everybody to rent this film.",1325116800,9,700,4.392307692307693
4099944,5,B003A7VXSS,"Sion Sono is currently my favorite film-maker right now.. His movies are freaking brilliant/thought-provoking and flat out entertaining... If you're looking to dive into Japanese Cinema, look no further or stop looking and start diving into this guy's filmography.... I just hope for the U.S distribution nothing will be edited or cut out, we the people demand the fully uncut version and rumor is floating around that this movie was supposedly 6 hrs???",1324252800,8,453,5.219178082191781
4099945,5,B003A7VXSS,"First off, I feel I must give this warning for potential watchers of this film.  Some of the main themes such as religion, cult and sexuality are brought in to the forefront.  If you are uncomfortable with these controversial themes at all, this probably isn't the movie for you.  Were a rating to be released in the US for this movie, it would probably be an R or higher.  That being said, these themes are acknowledged tastefully and with a purpose.

The characterization is beautiful and the acting is so breathtaking.  It's no surprise that Love Exposure won 14 awards and was nominated for 2 others.

The storyline follows three characters, teenagers who have been abused by their parents.  The main male character, Yu, is a devout Catholic whose father entered priesthood after the death of their wife and mother.  However, his father becomes involved with a woman who eventually runs off.  His father changes and forces Yu to come to confessionals every day and force him to confess sins that he didn't commit.  Yu is forced to lie to his father but when he is discovered, he feels he must actually commit sins so he won't lie be lying to his father.  These sins become more and more heinous until finally he starts taking sneak pictures up girl's dresses.  He doesn't take these pictures to be turned on, but instead to merely have sins he can confess.

One day, his friends dare him to dress as a woman and go kiss a girl he likes.  He helps to save a girl, Yoko, from thugs and kisses her before he runs away.  His life takes a turn when his father's lover returns with Yoko in two and the two become adopted siblings.  However, there is someone on the outside, the third character, who is craftily maneuvering their lives so as to induct them into the cult religion, the Zero Church.  It's up to Yu to maintain his own faith as he travels through the underworld in order to find the third girl out and save his family from being converted into the cult.

This story is twisted from start to finish and the cinematography is well-thought out and gorgeous.  The movie is four hours long, but flies by.  Every second is filled with a fantastic romance meets comedy meets thriller storyline.  I rate the story five stars out of five.  This movie has easily become one of my favorite films of all time.",1299542400,38,2308,4.535108958837772
4099946,5,B003A7VXSS,This 4 hour romantic shock epic is a must see for the fans of Sono's earlier work or anyone with an adventurous taste in film. I have never seen anything remotely like it and is worth getting a region free dvd player so I can share it with my friends.,1281312000,9,251,4.04
4099947,5,B003A7VXSS,a very special movie!,1423008000,,21,4.5
4099948,5,B003A7VXSS,"One of the craziest/longest movies I've seen in my life. And I loved every second of it. It tells a unique story, and Sion Sono is becoming one of my favorite directors because of his ability to show raw passion/sadness while mixing in a ton of humor with it. Brilliant.",1422057600,3,270,4.42
4099949,5,B003A7VXSS,"As another reviewer has said, this is a movie about how people deal with the influences of their fathers. Against all my expectations, the movie works, despite its formidable length and its numerous digressions. (Bear in mind that your enjoyment will depend on how easily offended you are.) It's four hours long, but since it's broken into chapters, you can treat it like a TV miniseries and watch it over a few days.",1420761600,2,417,4.726027397260274
4099950,5,B003A7VXSS,"Easily my deserted island movie, as in if you had to move to deserted island and could bring only one movie with you.  Even if the deserted island was run by a psychopath who made me watch the movie 24/7, I wouldn't mind so much.  In fact right now I am torn between going to work every day or staying home and watching this movie over and over for the rest of my life.  If I owned a bar, I would screen this movie during all business hours, and nobody would leave until they had seen the entire four hours from start to finish, sound and subtitles or no.",1418342400,,555,4.073394495412844
4099951,5,B003A7VXSS,An amazing movie. I can't remember when the last time a nearly 4-hour movie not only held my interest but captivated me. This one's impossible to describe but I loved it.,1415404800,,170,4.516129032258065
4099952,5,B003A7VXSS," - ai no mukidashi - Love Exposure - Is a Japanese movie.
This movie is kinda like an epic. It has comedy, romance, tragedy, perversion, action, passion, religious corruption...
Insane character development. Awesome chapter sequences. Deep messages.
Hilarious moments. Excruciatingly sad moments. Extremely perverted moments.
Very bloody moments. Extremely happy moments. Intensely engaging characters and story. A great soundtrack.
Last but not least, the message of Love, and how powerful it truly is, no matter the circumstance.
This movie has EVERYTHING. There is SOMETHING in this movie for everybody.
It's a literal roller-coaster and the end makes the whole ride even more worth the watch.
I cannot express how good of a movie this is, that's how good it this!
I've never seen anything directed, written, and played out so well.
This is my favorite movie, out of all movies I've watched, from Japan or any other country.
This is coming from somebody who watches movies constantly, I mean all the time.
Don't be put off by the 4-hour run-time, it goes by quick and it's a run ride!

4099953,5,B003A7VXSS,"Olive Films, like the Criterion Collection, has an eclectic mix of classic and contemporary releases, and Love Exposure is without a doubt one of their best.  Sion Sono has always been known for making subversive films that dealt with the darker side of human nature (Suicide Club, Strange Circus, Noriko's Dinner Table).  In many ways, he is the modern version of another great Japanese cult director, Nagisa Oshima.  Love Exposure is his most personal and passionate film...an amazing four hour long ride through Catholicism, cults, up-skirt photographers, and love.  Like the films of Tarantino, Love Exposure is a genre mash-up that veers from melodrama, to horror, to pure bliss.  It truly is a one of a kind film, so check it out if you can!",1367539200,4,747,4.944
4099954,5,B003A7VXSS,"The movie was weird and interesting all at the same time!  I one of those movies that just want to know what's next.  It start slow, but you'll still want to finish it.",1357430400,3,168,4.0606060606060606
4099955,5,B003A7VXSS,"Great movie, and great condition. The plot somehow holds you with its sexual content throughout the film and it's bizarre style does not fail to deliver.",1355184000,2,153,4.923076923076923
4099956,2,B003A7VXSS,"Sorry, folks but I didn't like it and can't share the same enthusiasm as other commentators do. Wasn't even able to finish this 3 hour flick. Maybe I'm already too old for this kind of movies. The idea of photographing the young girls' panties using acrobatic movements doesn't talk to me much. Neither ""religious"" and underground ""cult"" aspects of the film were interesting for me. To my mind, the Japanese cinema greatness, like that of the Italian cinema, stayed in the 50's, 60's and 70's (Kurosawa, Shindo, Suzuki, Imamura, Kobayashi, Teshigahara, Ozu, Mizoguchi).",1355097600,5,569,5.129032258064516
8392842,5,B003A7VXSS,"In a way I don't want to say anything about the movie, since the best way to experience this film is without any prior knowledge of what is going on, but I'll try my best to explain what makes it so great. The movie tackles the topics of teenage lust, faith in religion vs faith in relationships, cults, and even mild pedophilia. Point is, the flick is a mixing pot of themes and without spoiling anything, it is one Hell of a ride. The film style is that of typical Japanese cinema, meaning it looks made for tv by Hollywood standards but that shouldn't be too large of a barrier to get over. At the end of the day the movie is long and weird, but most importantly, entertaining. Do yourself a favour and pick it up, and if you enjoy the movie enough, import a Korean copy of the six hour cut and have fun time with that.",1519344000,,822,4.176100628930818

I don't care if it's 4 hours long, just shut up your whining and watch it. ***HOWEVER*** As to the format of the disc itself, I must warn first-time viewers that the main menu screen features a spoiler that ruins a moment in the film.
