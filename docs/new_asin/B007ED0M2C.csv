5079432,1,B007ED0M2C,"What words can I express about this DVD other than What the &*^*?! Let's start with the packaging Nice and with the box art the words Collector's edition is in gold. But wait...whats this? Mistake #1 They placed on the wrong Dr. Robotnik last time I checked this was Adventures of Sonic not Sonic Underground or SatAM. The Sonic design is okay. I turned it over to the side box art and whats wrong with this? The Sonic SatAM logo instead of the AoStH logo Mistake #2. Let's go to the back. Back is good except where it says ""Special Bonus Features"". Well I decided to check it out I put in both discs....Trailers include seeing Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 5 times, legend of Zelda twice and something about dirt 5 times as well. The trailers on both discs are exactly the same. Bonus Features are the exact same as the ones on The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog Season One set from Shout Factory.
And now the Pros and Cons between this piece of crap and Shout Factory's
Pros of Shout Factory: 22 off the wall episodes, How to draw Sonic featurette, Correct characters and logos on case and box, Milton Knight interview. No repeat DVD trailers.
Cons of Shout Factory:....Actually I got none.
Pros of NCircle Season 1 Sonic: Classic Sonic Episodes...sadly same ones as Shout's
Cons of Ncircle Season 1 Sonic: Same Bonus Features as Shout's version....sad. Same DVD trailers seen 5 times in a row all throughout the 2 disc set. Only 16 Episodes, Incorrect Eggman on box art, Wrong logo on box art.
In short you want AoStH on DVD just stick with Shout's version.
Stars 1 out of 5. NCircle listen Sonic already is having a bad gaming reputatation don't do the same to his TV shows.",1339286400,9,1684,4.524590163934426

8515215,4,B007ED0M2C,"I always loved watching Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog as a kid whether it was on before school weekdays on Fox or Saturdays after Kids WB signed off(I really miss syndicated cartoons). Even as an adult, I still like this series. Sure it may not be as story driven or as well animated as Sonic SatAM, but I like for what it is: A funny little cartoon where Sonic and Tails go on wacky adventures and stop Robotnik and his badniks from taking over the world.

Something to bear in mind: this is NOT a re-release of Shout Factory's AoSTH Volume 1 set with new packaging like the Super Mario Bros 3 DVD set. This is a 2-disc set that contains the first 16 episodes of the show(though I'm not sure why they went with SatAM Robotnik on the cover, but whatever...) Here's a list of the episodes:

Disc 1:

1. The Super Special Sonic Search & Smash Squad
2. Subterranean Sonic
3. Lovesick Sonic
4. Slowwww Going
5. High Stakes Sonic
6. Sonic Breakout
7. Trail of the Missing Tails
8. The Close Encounter of the Sonic Kind

Bonus: A Conversation With Artist Milton Knight

Disc 2:

9. Momma Robotnik's Birthday
10. Big Daddy
11. Sonic's Song
12. Birth of a Salesman
13. Best Hedgehog
14. The Robotnik Express
15. Too Tall Tails
16. Tails' New Home

Bonus: How to Draw Sonic the Hedgehog

One annoying thing about this set though is that the intro and end credits are cut from the episodes and you can only see them with the ""play all"" function(the theme song plays in the first episode and the credits play after the last episode on each disc).

I'm a little disappointed that NCircle didn't just rerelease the Shout Factory set like they did with SMB3, but at least this set is relatively inexpensive. Now if only they'd release the rest of the series...",1460332800,4,1749,4.4576802507836994
