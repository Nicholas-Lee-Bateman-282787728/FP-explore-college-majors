Years later she finally tracks him down to his ancestral home in the bayou's of Louisiana where she discovers that a medical procedure that saved her husband from death has turned him into an alligator mutant. The movie is overacted, over-the-top and ridiculous, but I could not help but enjoy every ridiculous minute of it. Overall the picture quality of the main feature is acceptable with only some minor scratches, but the same is not true of the trailer and accompanying trailers for both 1958s ""The Fly"" and ""The Omen.""

948649,5,6304973411,"I love this freakin' movie. It is the most ridiculous story in the world, but what fun to watch. Partly because I am a horror movie junkie and I tend to be a sucker for any kind of monster. So here's a movie with an Alligator man. How cool is that. The fact that this impossibly stupid idea is treated with the utmost seriousness, as if it were just as epic a horror concept as Dracula or Frankenstein, is what makes the movie so cool.

I once read an interview with (lead actress) Beverly Garland where she said that she and the lead actor could barely get through their performances because they kept busting up laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of their dialogue. They only played it off by trying to make it look like they were biting back tears. Knowing that makes watching the movie even more fun 'cause you can clearly see it. Every time Ms. Garland's lips start trembling, or she covers her mouth with her hand, or turns away from the camera while attempting to carry on a serious discussion about the man she loves turning into an alligator, you know she's just barely succeeded at containing another laughing fit.

The fact that everybody went ahead and made the movie anyway shows what great sports they all were, and that they were having a genuinely fun time making this crazy movie.

Add to that a truly lunatic performance by Lon Chaney, the goofy looking Alligator man itself, a bunch of zombie-like surgical patients who look like they are wearing bathroom urinals on their heads, and you have a genuine cheese-fest of gonzo horror hilarity.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention, there is a great scene in the middle where Beverly Garland (who looks extremely sexy) goes running outside, into the swamps, trying to find her monstrous husband. A heavy rainstorm starts. There are several wild animals to snap at her heels and many sharp branches to snag her clothing. In classic pulp story fashion, the pretty girl ends up soaking wet and barefoot, her clothes torn to shreds. Evil old Lon Chaney finds the poor, nubile, drenched thing, and carries her off and attempts to have his way with her. Then of course she is rescued by the scary, half-mutated Alligator Man.

A very strange tale emerges: When her husband Paul disappears on their honeymoon, Jane traces him to a Louisiana plantation deep in the swamps where no one will tell her what happened to him. She insists on staying and discovers Paul is around but can't find him. Why? Because mad doctor George Macready is performing bizarre experiments with alligators (and people) and Paul is turning into an alligator!  Lon Chaney Jr. co-stars as a hook-handed assistant with a hatred for ""gaters"" because one bit off his hand and Frieda Inescourt (""Return of the Vampire"") is the mistress of the plantation trying to cover up the awful horrors as Garland gets more and more inquisitive. There's Deep South atmosphere to spare and creepy crawlies in the swamp as Garland runs around screaming. She's good as Jane and really put through the mill here. Obviously, this is no classic but it's a fun 50's creature feature for collectors with laughable make-up effects and a fun turn by Chaney Jr. with that hook-hand. No wonder Jane developed amnesia after this experience...when you see the ""alligator-man"" you'll know why. Gotta love it.",1088899200,3,1234,4.848341232227488
948651,3,6304973411,"The Alligator People is an interesting little tale of suspense and misguided science.  Lovely Beverly Garland is a nurse, who under hypnosis recounts the tale of the mysterious disappearance of her husband, to a pair of dead pan psychologists.
The story unfolds in flashbacks, and begins on a train, with newlyweds Joyce and husband Paul Webster (Richard Crane) celebrating their nuptials.  Their happiness is short lived, when after receiving a telegram, Paul suddenly departs the train, and disappears into the night.  Joyce's search for him is fruitless, until months later she uncovers a lead that takes her to a Louisiana plantation know as ""The Cypresses"".
The atmosphere in the muggy, muddy bayou is full of danger and foreboding, as Joyce arrives there with a creepy caretaker Manon, played by Lon Chaney Jr.  The lady of the manor claims to know nothing of her husband, and an apprehensive Joyce is instructed to spend the night locked in a guestroom.
There really isn't much action, but there is some suspense, as what we all suspect has happened, is slowly revealed (remember the title?).  Husband Paul, suffering the side effects of an experimental medical treatment, has acquired reptilian characteristics.
Beverly Garland's performance holds your attention.  Her character is intelligent and determined.  Richard Crane is sympathetic as Paul, but it is Lon Chaney Jr's ""electrifying"" performance that puts some spice and sparks into the picture.
Definitely a B movie, but not a bad one.  For a taste of old time horror, you could certainly do much worse.",1058572800,2,1568,5.169960474308301

948653,3,6304973411,"""The Alligator People"" begins with a rather interesting framing device for the story.  Jane Marvin (Beverly Garland) is a nurse at a sanitarium who agrees to be hypnotized.  But when she is under she says her real name is Joyce Webster and proceeds to tell a shocking story.  Well, a weird one at any rate.  It seems Joyce married a war veteran named Paul Webster (Richard Crane) who received a telegram when the couple were on their honeymoon and disappeared.  Not one to take such things lying down, Joyce tracks her husband down to an old mansion in the Louisiana swamps.  After a bit of traditional gothic horror, she discovers that a scientist (George Macready) has being doing experiments to help war veterans regenerate lost limbs (good idea) using injections of alligator serum (bad plan).  Of course, this noble experiment goes horrible wrong and the title probably gives away the horrible truth of what is happening to poor Paul.
""The Alligator People"" is a modest example of a B-movie and if you stop and think about it the plot is pretty much the same as ""The Fly,"" which was released the year before.  However, this film loses a star just for the alligator suit (although makeup artist Dick Smith would later go on to do ""The Exorcist"" and ""Amadeus,"" so he can be forgiven for being a novice back in 1959).  As long as we are talking pedigree, director Roy Del Ruth directed ""The Maltese Falcon"" (No, not that one, the 1931 version).  The best sequence in the film is when the creepy handyman with the hook (Lon Chaney, Jr. in a wasted sterotype character) chases poor Joyce through the swamp, past all those snakes and alligators, in the rain someone reminiscent of the climax of Todd Browning's ""Freaks.""  Unfortunately, that is not the climax of the film, which smacks too much of traditional melodrama.
The big question is whether this 1959 film inspired Stan Lee to create the villain ""The Lizard"" in issue #6 of ""The Amazing Spider-Man.""  Dr. Curt Connors lost his right arm during the war and was experimenting with a serum made from lizards blood which certainly hints at a connection.  Was this film the inspiration for the Lizard?  My guess would be ""Yes.""  Does circle get the square, Stan?",1036022400,,2214,4.729166666666667

A serum derived from the common alligator can repair the disfiguring injuries suffered by accident victims.  Granted, this is a new wrinkle in an old garment.  The cure includes unforeseen after-effects over time, as the patients change into ""alligator people.""  The science is pretty fuzzy, but it serves as an excuse for the plot.  Beverly Garland is the determined wife, searching for answers to what is tormenting her husband.  He survived a plane-crash because of the miracle serum.  The guy skips out on their honeymoon after receiving a distressing telegram, and disappears.  The film brings Lon Chaney, Jr. back from career oblivion as a drunken Cajun who lusts after Ms. Garland, hates 'gators, and generally raises hell.  Lon's acting shows he sees the bizarre humor of it all.  The setting down in the swamp heavy with Spanish moss is a weird touch.  The fright makeup is a crocodile-shaped head mask and a rubbery lizard sweatshirt.  Notice the gap between the shirt collar and the neck of the head mask.  The interim stage of metamorphosis is more eerie.  It consists of scaly skin and twisted human features.  Except for Lon, the cast and director grimly proceed with a straight face.  As old sci-fi flicks go, this one is less familiar, but collectors need it to complete their home library.  Others, beware 'gators in the night. ;-)",999561600,2,1461,4.971074380165289
948655,2,6304973411,"Recently re-screening this film again, for the first time in about 36 years, I was surprised to find that it is about as good as I remembered it -- that is, not very!  But it remains a fairly enjoyable example of grim Fifties B and W horror.  A well-meaning scientist has discovered a miraculous method which enables humans to recover from devastating injuries in the same way some reptiles do.  Wow!  But there is, of course, one little side effect -- it also turns them into semi-alligators.  Beverly Garland turns in a good performance as the gutsy heroine, and so does Lon Chaney Jr as a brutish drunk.  The atmospheric swamp setting is also a plus.  The big payoff scene, in which the unfortunate hero gets an overdose of radiation and becomes an almost total alligator (complete with alligator head) is memorably outrageous.",981244800,2,830,4.7622377622377625

His hatred for the critters is evident as he runs over one with his truck and stands by the swamp one night with his pistol, blasting away, but not hitting a damn thing! At this stage in his life, Chaney probably had playing a drunk down pat since he was reportedly drunk while filming a lot of his movies.
The Alligator People is a typical campy 1950s horror flick, but it's good fun to watch on a Saturday night with a bucket of popcorn.
The scenes in the Louisiana swamp and at the plantation add a spooky ambiance to the movie, which really helped it along.",975974400,2,679,4.271317829457364

It stars the all-time great scream queen Beverly Garland and Lon Chaney as a lush with a hook for a hand on one arm.

The cast is actually quite impressive, and includes the likes of Lon Chaney Jr. and Beverly Garland, so acting isn't the problem.  There are many other issues, however, chief among them an extremely slow-moving plot that makes the short running time drag on impossibly.  The bulk of the film is too talky and suffocated by a thinly-veiled ""mystery"" that only serves to slow things down even more.  The title of the film probably leads one to believe there are going to be a lot of reptilian monsters running amok, but this is not the case.  There are only a smattering of creature effects, concentrated largely at the film's underwhelming climax, and these are over with quickly.  The writer and director should have enhanced the movie's sci-fi and horror elements and built more thrills into the lethargic story.  Though well-acted and graced with an nice, eerie setting in an alligator infested swampland, the film just doesn't have enough action to make it a worthwhile viewing experience for anyone except science fiction junkies like myself.",1446681600,,1157,4.93298969072165

A car parks at Webly Sanitarium. There is a problem with a young girl. Jane undergoes narco-hypnosis. No one lies under sodium pentothal. We hear her story. Joyce just married a soldier she nursed. They are in a train compartment when they get telegrams. Paul Webster is troubled by his, he leaves the train. He just vanished! Private detectives could not find him. Joyce checked the records at Louisiana State University and went to his hometown in bayou country. [Note the box with its warnings.] We see two men capturing an alligator. Joyce enters the mansion in search of Paul. Mrs. Hawthorne isn't interested in her story, but she will give her a room for the night. Dont leave your room under any circumstances! At night she hears shots! Luanne warns Joyce about a trouble house.

Mrs. Hawthorne talks to a man on the telephone. A man has to be restrained in a hospital. Mark talks to Mrs. Hawthorne. Can Cobalt 60 be used in treatment? Joyce hears piano music at night. The man runs away! (He has a skin condition.) Dr. Mark Sinclair drives a swamp buggy, he visits Mrs. Hawthorne. What are they trying to hide? At night Joyce sees Paul, who runs away. She follows and steps over alligators! A snake hisses at her feet! She is rescued and given refuge in a cabin. Will she be nice to her rescuer? She screams, Paul shows up for a fight and takes her back to that house. Dr. Sinclair hesitates about treating Paul. He will tell Joyce everything. Joyce visits and sees masked patients. Dr. Sinclair explains about lower animals. Some can regrow a lost limb. Could this substance be used to treat humans with mangled limbs? Did it work for Paul?

Joyce sees Dr. Sinclairs prize patient. The cure had an unintended consequence. Those treated turned into reptiles! Could Gamma rays cure this condition? [Only in a movie.] Marion enter the mansion with a pistol in his hand! There is conflict and a struggle! Paul has changed! Marion is shocked by this. Paul runs away, there is a struggle in the swamp. Joyce avoids the quicksand. Later the psychiatrists discuss the testimony. Goodnight, Jane.

This is an about average story, science fiction or horror (take your pick). For horror I prefer the old werewolf movies (a man changing into a beast). [For some reason women do not turn into monsters, except vampires.] They are based on old legends that are found around the world. Can a man who is pure in heart turn into a monster due to external influences? Is there a cure? We don't have to worry about werewolves or vampires in America because immigration laws keep them out.

948784,5,6304973411,"No, Beverly Garland didn't say that in the film, but it would have made for a great line in what is decidedly one of my favorite 1950's B creature feature movies.  It may seem odd to give a picture like this five stars but it deserves it for what it accomplishes and for its remarkable cast of reliable actors who had starred in earlier Hollywood classics.  The story line is standard 1950's fare with medical experiments gone wrong with the usual monstrous results.

The ever-reliable scream queen Beverly Garland leads a cast of accomplished actors.  Along with Lon Chaney who made Universal a lot of money with his movies, ALLIGATOR PEOPLE gives us George Macready who was in GILDA and PATHS OF GLORY, Frieda Inescort who appeared in THE LETTER and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (the Greer Garson vehicle) and Bruce Bennett (of MILDRED PIERCE fame).  The old troopers give it their all which shows what professionals they were, considering the material they had to work with.

My main criterion for judging the fitness of a creature feature is if it has at least one certain 'moment' where one either reacts with shock (THE DAY THE MARS INVADED EARTH) or with a shriek of joy and laughter when the 'creature' is revealed (THE WASP WOMAN).  ALLIGATOR PEOPLE definitely is an example of the evocation of the latter.

ALLIGATOR PEOPLE is nicely filmed, it is far from boring, the actors give it their all, it is in black and white, and it is definitely worth the time. If you cherish these old 1950's B flicks as much as I do, this movie will make you smile.",1406332800,3,1548,4.624087591240876

The basic premise of the movie was so far ahead of it's time it's not even funny. There is a lot of research going on now (along with stem cell research) to cure things like spinal cord injuries and the regrowth of limbs. Since Alligators, etc can - to some extant anyway - regrow lost limbs this part of the movie is not as stupid as you might think.

The ending 'special effects' (IE a guy in a rubber suit) was pretty bad. However other than the very end the make-up was effective.

The story was above average for this kind of drive-in flick. Acting ranged from over the top to not bad. Direction was fairly good and Cinematography was actually pretty good (as well as effective). Sound and music fit well which was slightly unexpected. I liked the premise of using hypnosis to figure out what actually happened.

The story is fundamentally silly.  Paul and Joyce Webster (Richard Crane and Beverly Garland) are newlyweds on a train--when Paul receives a strange telegram.  He rushes from the train to make a telephone call and the train departs without him, leaving Joyce to search frantically for him.  After exhausting almost every lead, a seemingly neglible clue leads her to Louisiana swamp country, where she finds a mysterious house governed by a very dour Lavinia Hawthorne (Frieda Inescort), who denies knowledge of any such person as Paul Webster.  Since there is no train until the next day, Joyce must stay the night--and she soon becomes suspicious of Lavina, the strange Dr. Lorimer (Bruce Bennett), and the drunken groundsman Manon (Lon Chaney Jr.)  Just what is going on?  How does her missing husband fit in?  And what are these strange, human-like alligators that seem to prowl the swamp?

It isn't hard to figure out what's going on, but Garland gives it her all, the script is quite good, and although the ending is a bit ho-hum the whole thing is still worth watching.  Not first rate, but fun nonetheless.

The new husband leaves Beverly on the train as he runs off. Later you see why, as someone progresses into a hideous creature. All because of a scientist who is obsessed with some silly scheme, many animals and people have to be guinea pigs for his ego. Great fun and I urge you all to buy it. The film quality is good.

948870,2,6304973411,"""The Alligator People"" was a bit of a let down for me. I've loved these 1950's horror/sci-fi flicks since stumbling across our local UHF ""Creature Feature"" back in the 1970's when I was a kid. I loved the rubber suited monsters and the goofy fun that comes with the territory when watching one of these popcorn flick.

But ""The Alligator People"" didn't have any bite (okay...ouch...sorry that was pretty bad) because there really wasn't a monster. The scale covered dude on the cover does play a large role in the film, but is more an object of pity than of terror. Usually when the hideous monster isn't the villain, then the evil doctor that created the monster turns out to be the bad guy....not in this case. The doctor in ""Alligator People"" is a guy that is trying to right a wrong...not an evil guy bent on world domination.

The cast is top notch with Beverly Garland and Lon Chaney, and while Lon makes the most of his role (and really the only reason to give this one a try) it's simply not enough to carry the entire film.

Soon a man, who has a hook for a hand, comes along and asks her, "" Hey baby, you want a ride?"" The story moves along from there and is really well done for its time! Set in the Louisiana bayou with lots of gators, lots of interesting characters and lots of laughs.",1252627200,,728,4.0979020979020975
948927,4,6304973411,"Alligator People is a good example of a 50s-era horror movie with some clear ""B-movie"" limitations, but is nevertheless a fun flick.

The plot involves a newlywed's search for her husband after his mysterious disappearance.  After some clever sleuthing, she tracks him down to a grand old house deep in the Louisiana swamps.  Unbeknowst to her, the husband has been suffering from some peculiar side effects from an experimental treatment he received for a catastrophic injury.  For a clue as to the particular side effects...well, look at the title.

Like a lot of its 50's counterparts, the horror in this movie comes from a fear of the dangers of ""Science"".  I agree with others who compare this movie to ""The Fly"", but with one difference.  In that movie,  Science is inherently impossible to control, but ""Alligator People"" portrays a hopeful potential to overcome the dangers of Science which is ultimately thwarted by the irrational side of humanity (personified in this case by the alligator-phobe hick living in a swamp shack played by Lon Chaney, Jr.).

OK, enough film theory.  The weaknesses of this movie include: (1) too much filler -- the exposition-heavy talking scenes are a little too prevalent, (2) the inclusion of a psychiatric analysis of the wife which bookends the main story and is awkward and unnecessary, and (3) the special effects of the creature which are a little, uh, underwhelming.  The final transformation is more humorous than frightening (not exactly ""Creature of the Black Lagoon"" here folks).

Fortunately, the movie works because of the prominence of Beverly Garland.  She goes through the whole range of human emotions here and comes off as a very likable and intelligent character (not too hard on the eyes either).

Also the deep south bayou-feel of the movie adds a tremendous atmosphere which is another big plus.

Finally, the soundtrack's score by Irving Gertz is very effective.  (If you like it, check out Monstrous Movie Music's recording on included on its ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" CD.  That's how I discovered this title).",1242000000,,2082,5.058651026392962
948928,3,6304973411,"The very good last third of this film and an outstanding ending made this movie worthwhile to watch. One has to be patient in some of these classic films, as many of them begin rather slowly.....but there is a reward if you stick with it.

This story is told in flashback as a woman ""Joyce Weber,"" played by Beverly Garland) is given an injection and relates to two doctors the amazing story of what happened to her and her missing husband.

The title of the film is a bit misleading. ""Alligator People"" imply plural - more than one, but there really is only one alligator man in this film, and he only looks like a guy with a bad sunburn and acne! At the end, though, Crane dons a rubber suit with an alligator head that will have you howling - in laughter, not fear! The other alligator-men are only shown as patients lying in their beds. It's all part of a man-plays-God experiment in which the good doctor is trying to help people who are desperately ill or injured.

Without giving the last 25 minutes away - which was very good - along with particularly excellent ending that had some intelligent twists to it - suffice it made up for the earlier slower moments.",1241740800,,1168,4.423255813953489
948929,4,6304973411,"On her wedding night, a woman's husband abandons her.  She goes out on a search for him and finds herself in the bayou.  Once there she finds hubby, but he's not the man he used to be.....HE'S ONE OF THE ALLIGATOR PEOPLE!!  Seems a scientist has found a new miracle cure for folks who have suffered severe physical trauma.  It takes that old fact of a lizard growing back it's tail after losing it, and tries to apply it humans.  By injecting folks with Hydrocortisone from alligators, they can reconstruct any damaged by tissue, including missing limbs.  Hubby was in a bad plane crash a year earlier and underwent the treatment.  The catch is that a year after treatment, patients literally start turning into alligators.  This explains why he abruptly ditched his wife.  He waits around the lab for his chance to try the scientist's new solution that involves gamma rays.  Also creeping around is Lon Chaney as an alligator hating Cajun with a hook for a hand.  He's a bit like a demented version of Carl Weathers from Happy Gilmore, only he's white, doesn't play golf, is a Cajun and didn't star in Action Jackson.  The whole thing makes me think of the Cajun alligator villain, Leatherhead, from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon.  I love that guy!
It all adds up to another fun ""science gone awry"" horror flick of the 50s.  Dig in if it's your kinda thang.",1206748800,,1369,4.626556016597511
948930,3,6304973411,This is a decent Horror Movie. Lon Chaney plays a pretty good role as a Gator Hater. The setting in the Bayous make it interesting as well. The ending is pretty good and i would recommend it..because of LON CHANEYS apperance in the movie. Overall not a bad movie for late on Saturday night.,1178409600,,290,4.388888888888889
948931,3,6304973411,"""The Alligator People"" is a typical, 50s, low-budget horror film that provides some fun for fans of the genre ( fans like me ! ). It would be an understatement to say that special effects and make-up have made a quantum leap in movies since 1959, the year that this film was released theatrically. Today, many viewers will find the title creatures more amusing than horrific.

At the same time, ""The Alligator People"" does benefit from a couple of good performances and a wonderfully creepy atmosphere. Beverly Garland stars as a young nurse who marries a handsome pilot, only to have him disappear on their honeymoon.
Her search for the missing groom eventaully leads her to a forbidding old mansion in the middle of a Louisiana swamp. The local residents are far from welcoming, not to mention various alligators and snakes that infest the area. She does indeed find her errant husband, very much a ""changed"" man thanks to the efforts of a mad scientist. The whole saga is told in flashbacks, as Ms. Garland relates her amazing story, under hypnosis, to her psychiatrist.

Beverly Garland is terrific in the lead, an attractive actress who deserved better projects than Grade B horror flicks. I must admit though that she has one quality that is compulsory for this type of movie--she sure knows how to scream ! Richard Crane is the unfortunate husband, spending much of the film looking like he has the rash from hell ! Veteran heavy George Macready is the ""mad doctor"", although his performance lacks the maniacal spark that would have added to the fun. Horror film icon, Lon Chaney, is ""worth the price of admission"" with his super, over-the-top role as a demented, alcoholic swamp denizen, who ""hates dem gators""--it seems that one of them chomped his hand off! His scenes with Ms. Garland are classic--his intentions for her totally dishonourable. For Chaney fans, this title is a ""must"".

The movie has plenty of atmosphere, whether the scene takes place in the swamp with ""dem gators"", snakes and deadly quicksand, or the spooky old mansion where medical experiments are backfiring in the worst possible way.

""The Alligator People"" was a black and white, Cinemascope production, and the DVD captures all of its widescreen ""glory"". Except for the occasional line, I found the picture quality to be excellent--the sound what you would expect. Several trailers for this film, and other Fox thrillers are included.

Yes ""The Alligator People"" has ""quickie, exploitation flick"" stamped all over it, and the title monster is undeniably goofy. However, for fans of old horror/sci fi movies, there is more than enough here to keep you entertained. Besides--look at the title--were you really expecting ""Citizen Kane"" ? !

A very sad footnote--Ms. Beverly Garland passed away on 5 December 2008. While most of her films were of the ""B"" variety, she went on to a long and successful career in television. She guest-starred on an astonishing number of TV programs, a tribute to her popularity and versatility. Ms. Garland will be missed.",1100822400,17,3036,4.954813359528488
948932,5,6304973411,"The Alligator People is more of a mild hoot, than a horror film.  One of the grade C-flicks, not good enough to be a B-Drive In film!  Still, it's a delight to people who love old B&W horror films.  This film must be loaded with more phobias and prejudices per square inch than any other horror film of the period, yet instead of insulting people (too much, lol) it all gels into one great time.

Two doctors are talking at the start of the film, and one is telling he has just heard a story under hypnosis that he can scarcely credit.  Jane (Beverly Garland), his receptionist, recounts the tale, which the doctor plays for his colleague.  Jane had married a man from the Southern US, and while on their honeymoon, they were sitting on a train.  He receives a frantic telegram, gets off at the station to place a telephone call, only to have the train pull off with his waiting Bride.  The Bride gets off at the next stop and tries to find her groom, but he has vanished.

After years of searching, she finally tracks down the ancestral home of his family.  His domineering mother does not welcome Jane, but Jane won't go away without answers to her questions.  At times, as Jane prowls the bayous the movie is quite hauntingly lensed.  However, dialog is stilted, frustrating, rushed, the acting is OTT or so understated it borders on laconic, and the special effects, well, as I said are grade C.  Toss in the great Lon Chaney as a drunken lecherous redneck swamp-rat, a perfect bizarre touch to one strange film that seems to succeed in spite of itself!

Great fun for a cold rainy autumn night.",1097020800,8,1599,4.4878892733564015
948933,3,6304973411,"Based on a true story (okay, it's not), The Alligator People (1959), often confused with the film The Crocodile People (okay, there's no such film), relates a completely fantastic tale (well, maybe not fantastic, but pretty darn good) of what happens when a scientist tries to utilize the regenerative properties inherent within the genetic make-up of reptiles on humans, with unexpected results (the title of this film should give you a hint).

The Alligator People was directed by Roy Del Ruth, a man who's forte was tense crime dramas for Warner Brothers in the 30's, then lavish musicals for MGM after that, and was also responsible for what many consider to be the worst biography made yet in The Babe Ruth Story (1948), yeah, the one with William Bendix, but I digress...the film stars the very attractive and highly prolific Beverly Garland (remember her role in the definitive 1979 film Roller Boogie) as Joyce Webster, a recently married woman whose husband Paul, played by Richard `Rocky Jones, Space Ranger' Crane, ran off during their honeymoon, after receiving a mysterious telegram (boy, talk about your cold feet, although you're suppose to run off BEFORE you get hitched, fool)...anyway, not one to take a fairly obvious hint, Joyce begins a long and fruitless search for her beloved, one that finally leads her to some lovely swampland somewhere in the south, Louisiana, I believe.  It's here where she discovers Paul is holed up on a plantation of sorts, participating in some weird and wacky experiments conducted by scientist Dr. Eric Lorimer (played by Bruce Bennett, who's appeared in some 120 plus features throughout the 30's well into the 60's, but I recall him from the films The Cosmic Man and Fiend of Dope Island).  On the `mad scientist' scale, Dr. Lorimer rates pretty low as he's not really mad or suffers from a god complex, but his experimentation, while appearing successful early on, has recently begun to exhibit serious scaly side effects (say that three times fast) on his human test subjects, and now he's remorseful and working to fix the problem.  Lessons learned, I suppose...finally we have Lon Chaney Jr., appearing as Manon, a caretaker/handyman (of sorts) who works on the plantation, but spends most all of his time either drinking his homemade hooch and/or tormenting gators.  I suspect his hatred of alligators has something to do with the hook for a hand (ahh, a classic case of CHS, short for Captain Hook Syndrome), and I was right...at least he's still got that one good hand for shooting his gun at gators, and that hook comes in handy for those pesky itches and handling sides of beef...what awful secrets does Joyce uncover about her husband, his murky past, and the inhuman experiments being performed deep in the alligator and snake infested swampy morass they call home?  Whatever they maybe be, you'll never get them from me...but you can probably figure it out for yourself, unless you've been into Manon's bathtub booze...yick...

I thought The Alligator People was really good, in terms of a B movie.  The title pretty much gives the plot away, in my opinion, as the story offers little in the way of shocks or surprises.  Beverly Garland was quite good, basically supporting the entire film on her shoulders, and I got a kick out of seeing her running through some fairly nasty and dangerous swampy pools with live alligators.  She's got more guts than I...she's also very easy on the eyes, which certainly helps.  Richard Crane did okay, but I thought his gravelly croc/man voice was pretty funny (along with his varying degrees of make-up and costumes).  As far as the character of Dr. Lorimer, I prefer my B movie scientists to be a bit more mad...he sure talked the talk, spewing technical mumbo jumbo at a pretty constant rate, ""The oscillating jiggy-ma-bob produces an equivalent of one billion kilovolts of energy!""  He did drive a rather cool swamp buggy, and managed to get his hands on a good amount of radioactive material (maybe the stuff wasn't that closely regulated back then), so I give him a bit of credit.  Lon Cheney Jr's character of Manon was a lot of fun to watch, but doesn't have a lot of screen time.  What he did have, he made the most of, playing the dirty, drunken, lecherous, gator hating, inbred, cayenne pepper snortin', backwoods Cajun hillbilly to the hilt.  One thing was for sure, he sure hated them gators...as I've said, the plot is pretty predictable (and silly), offering few, if any surprises, but it does move along fairly well (the film runs approximately 74 minutes), and stays on track.  The direction of the film was professionally done, handled by someone who knows his business, but lacked a hard to define quality I look for in good science fiction (I know, I know, the film is billed as a horror flick, but I felt it leaned more towards sci-fi).  The special effects were pretty low budget, especially the rubbery alligator suit donned by Clark (as mentioned by another reviewer).  I really wasn't expecting much in this area, and that's exactly what I got...all in all, a well-done cheapie film that's fun as long as you don't look at it too hard.  I will say, even though the plot was middling at best, I did find interesting the part at the very beginning, and at the very end, as the middle is presented in flashback form, providing a nice little twist.

The wide screen transfer provided on this DVD is exceptionally good-looking, and nearly flawless.  Added to that is two separate audio tracks, one mono and one stereo.  Special features include an original theatrical trailer, and trailers for other Fox releases, including The Fly, (1958), The Fly (1986), The Omen (1976), and Phantom Of The Paradise (1974).  Also, the cover artwork is really cool...look at it...go ahead...you know you want to...
