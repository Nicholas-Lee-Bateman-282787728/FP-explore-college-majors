2197121,5,B0006Z2NDQ,"I'm a big fan of both film noir and commentary tracks, and this disk has the best commentary of any film noir I've yet seen. It's done by Alain Silver, author of several books on noir, and coeditor of the ""you gotta have it"" reference book on noir:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Film-Noir-Encyclopedia/dp/1590201442/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Film Noir Encyclopedia</a>. I was particularly impressed with the professional production values of the commentary. Silver will mention a key piece of dialog, and precisely on cue he'll stop talking and the sound level of the movie will come up so you can hear what he was talking about. Several times I found myself wondering how they timed things so neatly.

Silver does a great job of pointing out the thousand details that make the movie work as a movie, the turns of plot that are typical of film noir, the use of darkness and shadow, the framing of scenes and placement of the actors, etc., etc.

Other reviewers have put in their vote for the quality of Thieves' Highway as a compelling and well made movie. I'd like to add my plug for the commentary track. In addition to being darn good entertainment, this is a movie that rewards careful examination and thoughtful reflection. Silver's comments are terrific guide to that reward.",1109116800,40,1335,5.233644859813084
2197122,4,B0006Z2NDQ,"Vultures prey upon the dead, as they are a vital part of the ecosystem that helps with environmental sanitization. Humans, however, are a different story, as they prey upon the living, the dead, and sometimes kill to accomplish their desired result. The reasons to why a person would go to great lengths to achieve desired results varies from person to person, but it often has to do with money. Jules Dassin's story Theives' Highway is an illustration of humans and their greed, which appears to be the motivation factor to break the compassionate fabric of moral value, ethics, and kindness in the true spirit of film noir.

Unlike film noir Thieves' Highway opens with Nick Garcos' (Richard Conte) homecoming during a sunny afternoon accompanied by hearing his father singing in the kitchen. Nick has brought presents to all of his family members and a bundle of money, which he has earned in order to settle down. The money should help Nick get married to Polly (Barbara Lawrence) and go into business with her father. However, this joyous moment is suddenly halted, as Nick finds out that his father has lost his legs.

Nick's father informs him of how he lost his legs, as he had done business with a certain Mr. Figlia (Lee J. Cobb). The story that Nick hears makes him cringe in anger, as he understands that Mr. Figlia had set up his dad through a dubious plan. When Nick heard the whole story he decides to return to his father's truck, as the man, Ed Prentiss (Millard Mitchell), who bought it had not yet paid for the truck. However, Nick goes into business with Ed and together they pick up some Golden Delicious apples that he intends to take to Mr. Figlia.

The life of a trucker means long hours, deadly and financial dangers, and very little sleep, as life on the road cuts between the driver and their family while they try to find a way to make a buck for their near and dear. Nick decides that this is what he wants to do, as Ed and he pick up two trucks full of apples in Fresno. The apples are to be taken to the wholesale produce market in San Francisco, which is described as a 36-hour drive.

In San Francisco the audience gets to follow Nick on his quest to find Mr. Figlia, an idea that never seemed to be fully thought through. Eventually he finds him and discovers that he is the man that he suspected him to be, a ruthless businessman that shows no consideration for anyone. The only thing that he seems to care about is the money he makes, which he is not willing to part with.

They Drive by Night (1940) offers a similar cinematic experience as Dassin's film, as it also depicts the struggles of truck drivers. However, Raoul Walsh's story is more glamorous, as the tale slowly drifts away from the tough life of being a truck driver. Dassin's story focuses on the job and on the characters within the environment in which they exists. They cannot escape to a better place, as it is their destiny to be where they are while they have to make the most out of it

A valuable side note is that the year after Thieves' Highway was released Jules Dassin was identified as communist by Edward Dmytryk, which made him blacklisted. As a result Hollywood lost one of their most promising directors and Dassin decided moved to France where he continued to make films. He made great films such as Rififi (1955) and Never on Sunday (1960). In the awareness of Dassin being blacklisted the audience gets to experience the films he made prior being blacklisted, which have terrific cinematic value. Thieves' Highway is one of these films that he left for coming generations to enjoy and ponder.",1108944000,16,3613,4.567901234567901

2197124,5,B0006Z2NDQ,"Every October, the American Film Institute in Silver Spring, Maryland features a film noir festival called ""Noir City DC.""  The movies in this year's festival include ""Thieves Highway"", a 1949 movie directed by Jules Dassin and based upon the book ""Thieves Market"" by A.I Bezzerides&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thieves-Market-California-Fiction/dp/0520207467/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thieves' Market (California Fiction)</a>1908 -- 2007). Bezzerides also wrote the screenplay. The 2012 Noir City Film Festival in San Francisco, where ""Thieves Market"" is set, also featured the movie.  Dassin was blacklisted following this movie and never made another film in the United States.

The movie is set in the frequently brutal world of marketing and trucking.  It includes a spellbinding performance by an Italian actress Valentia Cortese, as Rica, a femme fatale prostitute.  The primary character is Nick Garcos (Richard Cobb) who has just returned home from WW II, to learn that his father, who is in the business of trucking fruit to the wholesale San Francisco markets, has lost his legs in an accident caused by a crooked wholesaler, the wonderfully named villain, Mike Figlia (Lee Cobb). Determined to make a success of himself and to avenge his father, Nick takes a partner and hauls a large truckload of apples to market.

The movie has a strongly proletarian theme about the corruption of business and the exploitation facing workers at all levels, from the farms to the drivers to laborers in the cities. Most of the movie is set onsite at San Francisco's then-lively produce market called the Embarcero district, with workers in the district used as extras. The major attraction of the movie is the  opportunity to see this world in all its bustle, rawness, and frequent sleaziness.  Nick tries to see his truckload of apples to Figlia and is in the process of being cheated and seriously injured, as was his father. In the process, Figlia uses Rica to get at Nick.  He falls for her at the expense of his then girlfriend, Polly, (Barbara Lawrence).

The story is taut and well-acted, particularly by Cortese and by Cobb. The film is in effective, clear black and white. ""Thieves Highway"" displays the harsh character of lower class California life and the obstacles standing in the way of success.  Besides the scenes at the Embarcero, its adjacent hotels, bars, and railroad facilities, the movie captures the harsh, dangerous world of long-distance trucking with its hard competition to bring the produce to the market.

This is a fine period noir film. I am pleased to have the opportunity to get to know noir on film in a large theater setting after getting to know something of noir through reading.

2197127,5,B0006Z2NDQ,"THIEVES' HIGHWAY (1949)  was directed by Jules Dassin not long after finishing the classic noir prison film, BRUTE FORCE and directing THE NAKED CITY, a documentary-like city police procedural crime film which was groundbreaking in many ways.

THIEVES' HIGHWAY was written by veteran writer A.I. Bezzenrides, both the story and the screenplay.  Bezzenrides also wrote the novel ""Long Haul,"" the novel that THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT was based on. THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT is the Raoul Walsh trucking saga that helped put Bogart on the map. Mr. Bezzenrides was eventually blacklisted but
really showed himself to be knowledgable in the area of trucking and other slim profit  shirtsleeve businesses.

Of course, much of what he wrote could be construed as critical of capitolism but from what I've seen,
a lot of his writing seems to have been learned from hard, practical experience more than ivory tower political theory. In any event, Mr. Bezzenrides did have knowledge of how truckers, and produce buyers and sellers
practiced business, shorcuts and all.

The story of THIEVES' HIGHWAY concerns just returned home vet Nick Garcos, played by Richard Conte,  with a pocket full of money which when Nick learns of his fathers' near fatal injury in the trucking business Nick wants to invest at least partially just to get even with produce man Mike Figlia, played by Lee J. Cobb.
Figlia, as Nick soon finds out, has a very bad rep among the truckers but there never is much proof that
he is robbing them practically blind in buying then selling the produce the truckers bring in to his market.

NIck is out to change all that and just to get the apples to the market from southern California to San Francisco he practically kills himself and risks virtually everything he has in order to let Mike Figlia do his best to give him a raw deal.
But Nick works his way around Figlia and on the surface has won a major battle and gets what he wants financially at least.
All he needs to do is wait for his partner, Ed Kinney,played by Millard Mitchell, to drive his ancient truck in
 to San Francisco with the rest of the load and they will have had a very succesful trip.

But unfortunately, the ancient 1920s vintage truck just doesn't make it and neither does his partner.
Mike Figlia tries to take advantage of all of this with a girl named Rica. played by Valentina Cortese, who's not as crooked as she appears to be,  and a pair of jackrollers give Nick the full treatment but somehow, just when things look their darkest, Nick and his friends begin to work it all out.

THIEVES' HIGHWAY is a very good film noir in my opinion and a fairly unusual look into informal business
practices as run by both honest men and theives. I thought just about everything about THEIVES' HIGHWAY
was top grade, especially the acting.  Richard Conte once again acts in a naturalistic manner, just enough to be as believable as possible and the pairing of him with Millard Mitchell along with most others of the excellent supporting cast really works well to raise the credulity of the entire project.

And the direction of Jules Dassin is just fine. This was his third truly excellent film noir in a row and even though he followed THIEVES' HIGHWAY with the feverishly exciting NIGHT IN THE CITY, I wish Dassin had the chance to stay in America just so we could see what he might've come up with.

I rate THIEVES' HIGHWAY five stars.",1279843200,2,3403,4.676716917922948
2197128,4,B0006Z2NDQ,"A great cast -- Richard Conte, Valentina Cortese, Lee J. Cobb -- and a terrific story about the cut-throat world of trucking produce in post-World War II California.",1261699200,,165,4.928571428571429
2197129,4,B0006Z2NDQ,"Jules Dassin is probably my favorite director of the Film Noir period. This film deserves to be considered among his best. It tells the story of the hardships which truck drivers had to face during the post- WWII period. Many driver were injured driving unsafe trucks. We see trucks rolling over and the driver has neither door nor seatbelts to protect him. We see drivers being cheated by unscrulpulous buyers.
We also see the Can-do, never-say-die spirit which got the greatest generation through the depression and war years.
  Dassin is known for his great Noir movies ""The Naked City"", ""Night and the City"", and ""Rififi"". This film, while not Noir in its truest definition, is shot in the Noir style with lots of cynical attitude and great night photography. Like many films of this type, you get a good sense of what this country looked like in the late 1940s due to the film being shot on real city streets.
  Sadly, after Dassin completed shooting, the studio had an additional scene shot to give Dassin's Truck-Noir a happy ending. It sticks out like a sore-thumb but it does tie up all the unresolved issues in a pretty bow for those who like their movies that way. Happily, it does not ruin the movie.
  This is a Criterion Collection movie and it costs more. For that, you get a crisp, nearly-pristine copy of the movie, with a full commentary and a host of special features. I own a number of Criterions and consider them worth the price.",1249171200,4,1451,4.6484375
2197130,4,B0006Z2NDQ,"This was a pretty good film noir - nothing spectacular - involving a crooked trucking boss, ""Mike Figlia"" effectively played by Lee J. Cobb who was good at playing nasty villains.

In this story, a young trucker, ""Nick Garcos"" (Richard Conte) whose father was ruined by Cobb, goes after him to settle the score. Nick drives up north to San Francisco to seek him out but has some rough going himself.

The film had interesting characters and a different type of female lead in European actress Valentina Cortese, who was good film noir material.
In fact, it's definitely still a film to check out if you're a film noir fan.

I have this film on tape so if saw the Criterion DVD version, my opinion would probably go up ""a star"" on it, for the visuals alone, knowing Criterion's usual great job in the visuals department.",1244073600,,819,4.595890410958904
2197131,5,B0006Z2NDQ,"It's astonishing to consider that Jules Dassin was blacklisted for making supposedly anti-capitalist films like this in 1949. How times had changed from just a decade earlier, when John Ford's adaptation of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath was rightly hailed as a masterpiece. Both films attack the depersonalising excesses of capitalist greed but are also exceedingly pro-American in their little-guy-against-the-system optimism. Less epic in scale than Grapes of Wrath, Thieves' Highway is no less effective, a beautiful example of Dassin's strengths as a filmmaker: attention to fine details of character; an ability to suggest darker layers of society and behavior without being explicit about them (I love how the heroine of this picture is a cheap waterfront hooker, but nobody comes out and says it); a comic touch leavening an essentially grim world view; expressive visuals; and - perhaps most uniquely among noirish directors - a willingness to shamelessly embrace melodrama and emotional excess. Coming in Dassin's career between stylish tours de force like Naked City and Night and the City, Thieves' Highway has artistry that is more subtle, paying more attention to straightahead narrative and less to visuals and atmosphere, although there are set pieces like the truck overturning on the hillside that are quite breathtaking. In short, Criterion has brought to light another great chapter in the critical re-evaluation of this unique filmmaker.",1236211200,4,1455,5.5
2197132,4,B0006Z2NDQ,"I decided to give this movie another try and you know what, it's an excellent Noir. Richard Conte as Nick goes into business as a produce(Apples) driver/dealer in search of the man who crippled his father. Lee J. Cobb is great as the Mike Figlia, a conniving businessman who makes saps out of his customers..he has thugs who work for him, he hires a woman Rica (Valentina Cortesa) to more or less distract Nick, while he sells the apples underhandedly.
This is a very dark picture, with not a great deal of adversaries to overcome, gangs, the road and ""a dame""
Never did I think delivering apples could be so cutthroat ! :)
The Criterion DVD is the one to get, excellent full screen image quality and lots of extras (as posted by other reviewers)
Im glad I gave this film a second chance because I would have missed out on finding out how good a film this really is.

BRUTE FORCE-tense prison drama;THE NAKED CITY-NYC cops solve a murder; NIGHT AND THE CITY-with Richard Widmark as crooked wrestling promoter Harry Fabian, and this great film THIEVES' HIGHWAY starring Richard Conte,Lee J.Cobb,Millard Mitchell,Jack Oakie, Valentina Cortesse and as Conte's father Morris Carnovsky,who was also backlisted. But it is Cobb who walks away the film with his scene stealing performance as crooked produce middleman Mike Figlia. While watching the film you get the impression that Cobb is greatly enjoying every moment on screen as the amoral Figlia.

  After returning home,from a stint at sea,Nick Garcos(Conte) discovers that his father who is an independent produce truck driver, has lost his legs due to a trucking accident that may have been helped along by Figlias henchmen(Edwin Max & George Tyne) and that Figlias men may also have robbed him of the money Figlia gave him for a produce load.

After arriving at the produce market a battle of brains and brawn develops between Conte and Cobb(along with his henchmen)Valentina Cortese,a whore,payed by Cobb to divert Contes attention while Cobb ""sells"" Contes goods, turns out to be a hooker with a heart of gold and her character is contrasted to Contes WASPY intended Barbara Lawrence.

2197135,4,B0006Z2NDQ,"Richard Conte stars as Nick Garcos a mechanic on a freighter who arrived home with a wad of hard earned cash to invest in a business in Jules Dassin's pretty good film noir ""Thieves Highway"".  His homecoming is tempered by the discovery that his dad, a produce trucker had been swindled on the delivery of a load of tomatoes.  The guilty party, Mike Figlia. a crooked produce merchant played superlatively by the always excellent Lee J. Cobb arranged a road accident for Conte's dad where he lost both of his legs.

The enraged Conte also learns that his dad sold his ramshackle truck to Ed Prentiss played by Millard Mitchel and had yet to be paid.  He hustled down to Mitchell's place to take back the truck.  Instead he and Mitchell partnered in hauling a precious load of golden delicious apples that they hoped to sell in the produce market.  Using two trucks they befall many misfortunes on the road to San Francisco where Conte plans on getting retribution against the dishonest Cobb.

Cobb attempts to rob Conte but he is helped by Valentina Cortese playing Rica, a girl hired by Figlia to distract Conte while Cobb's flunkies unload his cargo.  Cobb eventually gets his just due and Conte falls in love with Cortese.

While this wasn't one of Dassin's best offerings ""Thieves Highway"" definitely had its merits.  The filming done in and around the streets of San Francisco added that effective noir touch.

The film is very entertaining and features some scenes that are among the best directed by Dassin.  I actually enjoyed it more than the better-known They Drive By Night.  Richard Conte does a serviceable job as the leading man, but the film's acting honors really go to the cast of supporting players, which includes Lee J. Cobb and Jack Oakie.  I was especially moved by Valentina Cortese's performance as Rica, the prostitute.  Barbara Lawrence's role as Polly, the leading man's girlfriend, is underwritten and doesn't make much sense, but in the DVD interview Dassin explains that the part was only intended to make Rica sympathetic.  (As usual, Lawrence is very good, though.) He also explains the reason for the few other scenes in the film that seem inconsistent with the general tone of the film (a reprimand by a policeman and the last scene).  In short, Thieves Highway is a very good noir by a great director, the DVD transfer is excellent, and the film is really worth checking out.",1127692800,6,1106,4.7894736842105265

Out for revenge Nico gets his father's truck and with a load of apples heads out to settle the score with Figlia.  Nico is in way over his head.

The screenplay by A. I. Bezzerides based on his own novel, ""Thieves' Market"", is riveting.  I loved the barely subdued hatred between Nico and Figlia.  But what really makes this film a minor masterpiece, besides all the wonderful performances, is the outstanding direction by Jules Dassin.  Every scene is impressive, it's kinda like watching a Kurosawa film in the way each shot seems so purposeful, detailed and beautiful.  The apples rolling down the hill and the man zipping up his jacket, despite the heat, as he watches the truck driver burn to death.  Haunting.

I read in a interview with A. I. Bezzerides in Lee Server's ""Screenwriter"" that Shelley Winters was originally slated to play the role of Rica, but Jules Dassin didn't want her!  That would have rocked, she was magnificent in A PLACE IN THE SUN.

2197139,5,B0006Z2NDQ,"Included on the special features for THIEVES' HIGHWAY is a short - 5 minutes or so - excerpt from a proposed documentary on writer A. I. Bezzerides, novelist and screenwriter.  Bezzerides wrote the novel (Thieves' Market) and the script for this one, as well as the earlier novel Long Haul, which was filmed as the George Raft/Humphrey Bogart vehicle `They Drive by Night.'  Both, I guess, can be called proletariat crime thrillers.  THIEVES' HIGHWAY stars Richard Conte - the underrated Richard Conte - as Nick Garcos, a young man who returns home from the sea to discover that his father was crippled while hauling produce and selling it to the unscrupulous Mike Figlia (Lee J. Cobb.)  Nick believes Figlia was directly responsible for his father's injuries, and so THIEVES' HIGHWAY is, to a great extent, an odyssey of revenge.

 The documentary clip tells us Bezzerides worked as a trucker for a while, and I believe it. This one feels like it was written from the inside.  Nick, along with veteran trucker Ed Prentiss (Millard Mitchell) buys a load, a first-of-the-season load, of golden delicious apples and points his truck towards San Francisco and an appointment with Figlia.  Trailing them is a couple of mercenary truckers played by Jack Oakie and Joseph Pevney. In San Francisco Nick will meet the good bad-girl Rica (Valentina Cortesa,) who will play a pivotal role in the fight between Nick and Figlia.

  This is Jules Dassin's last American film, and it's a beauty.  There are some great shots - Rica being chased through a dark alley, a loaded truck rolling over and spilling its load over a wide-angle hillside - and more than a few outstanding performances.  What sets this one apart, and above, most of its competitors is the realistic treatment it applies to the characters.  Save for Figlia, who is pure evil, the people in this one grow and change and shift allegiances.  Film historian Alain Silver provides a pertinent and informative commentary.",1123372800,15,1971,4.930303030303031
2197140,5,B0006Z2NDQ,"""Thieves' Highway"" is based on A.I. ""Buzz"" Bezzerides' novel ""Thieves' Market"", inspired by the authors' experiences as a long-haul trucker. The novel was released the same year as the movie, and Bezzerides wrote the screenplay as well, which deftly adapts the novel for an hour-and-a-half Production Code-compliant film. Bezzerides' most noted contribution to film noir was probably his screenplay for the 1955 film ""Kiss Me Deadly"", which masterfully undermined its source material -Mickey Spillane's novel- to memorable effect. ""Thieves' Highway"" was director Jules Dessin's last Hollywood film, before he fell victim to the blacklist. Stunning documentary-style cinematography lends realism and beauty to the working-class environment of rural California and the San Francisco produce market. The composition and mise en scene of some shots are perfection.  Exquisite cinematography, together with a great cast and characters, make it one of Dessin's greatest. Producer Darryl Zanuck tacked an implausible ending onto the film without Dessin's knowledge, and that is the film's weak point.

Nick Garcos (Richard Conte) returns to his family after traveling the world as a sailor, bearing gifts from abroad for everyone, including an engagement ring for his girlfriend Polly (Barbara Lawrence). But he finds that his father was crippled in an accident shortly after a San Francisco wholesaler, Mike Figlia (Lee. J. Cobb), got him drunk and neglected to pay him for a load of tomatoes. Determined to avenge his father's injuries, Nick visits Ed Kinney (Millard Mitchell), who now owns his father's truck. Ed proposes that Nick go in with him in purchasing 2 loads of the first crop of golden delicious apples, which they can truck to the city and sell at great profit. Nick agrees, as long as the city is San Francisco. Nick arrives in San Francisco several hours before Ed, and finds out quickly that Figlia plays dirty.

Lee J. Cobb and Richard Conte both turn in charismatic, emotionally energetic performances. Conte, something of a sex symbol of the day, plays Nick as a determined, tough, and angry proletarian hero, whose determination almost turns to mania. Lee J. Cobb is really something to see. He embraces Figlia's villainy and seems to be having a great time being a liar and a crook. Figlia's unhesitant corruption is captivating. The female characters are to some extent plot devices, but they're not easily forgotten. Italian actress Valentina Cortesa plays Rica, a woman employed by Figlia.  Rica initially has all the markings of a femme fatale. She is very forward, mocking, world-weary, but somehow sympathetic as we get the impression she is used to being treated badly and expects nothing else. The audience is clearly supposed to dislike Nick's fianc&eacute;e Polly. But she is only looking out for her interests, and Barbara Lawrence was so good at playing self-possessed but unlikable women.

2197141,3,B0006Z2NDQ,"Despite getting the Criterion treatment, 'Thieves Highway' is really just an average noir that gets off to a terrible start with a phoney-baloney scene of family reunion and suffers from a weak crime-does-not-pay ending shot behind Dassin's back, but the stuff inbetween is pretty good but not outstanding. There's a good feel for the vibrant nocturnal market location and the driving montages are well-handled, with Millard Mitchell, Jack Oakie and a barnstorming Lee J. Cobb offering good support, but it's not up there with 'Wages of Fear' or 'Hell Drivers.'",1120348800,4,561,5.2444444444444445
2197142,4,B0006Z2NDQ,"The Criterion Collection releases a select number of films every year on DVD; new and old films (""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"", ""Wages of Fear""), American and Foreign Films (""Riffiffi"", ""The Third Man"", ""The Seven Samurai"", ""Fanny and Alexander""), Documentaries (""Grey Gardens"", ""The Complete Monterey Pop Festival"") and so much more. That one company would release such a wide, influential and interesting series of films is enough to raise that company above the rest; many of the films released by Criterion are unavailable elsewhere, and don't even make it to the repertory circuit. However, Criterion rises above even this. Each of their DVDs are created from the best negatives available, or they restore the negative. But that still isn't enough. They frequently include interviews with the director (if the director is dead, they include interviews made before they died for other reasons and outlets), documentaries, trailers, television shows about the films, radio plays of the films, and more. DVDs from the Criterion Collection are a film lovers dream.

You won't like every film released by Criterion; some of the films are just plain weird, even for me, and I think ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"" is one of the best films ever made. Memo to Criterion: Consider the film suggested. But the collection of films, as a whole, is invaluable. They are more expensive than other DVDs, but consider the work that went into them and they are worth it.

One of their newest releases is ""Thieves' Highway"" directed by Jules Dassin (""Brute Force"", Burt Lancaster's second film), one of the many people affected by the Hollywood Blacklist of the 50s.

Nick Gracos (Richard Conte) returns home to Fresno, from a long journey at sea. An engineer on a ship, he traveled around the world. Returning home with an armful of exotic gifts and enough money to start his own business and marry his girlfriend, he finds that his father, Yanko (Morris Carnovsky) had an accident in his truck, rendering him unable to work. The circumstances surrounding the accident are fishy, but lead to Mike Figlia (Lee J. Cobb, fresh off his Broadway success, ""Death of A Salesman""), a San Francisco produce merchant. Determined to extract revenge, Nick buys a truck load of Golden Delicious apples, the first of the season, and starts driving north to meet Figlia.

I know, I know. A truckload of apples? How exciting. But this is a film noir made in 1949. That is important for two reasons. First of all, in the late 40s, a large portion of our commerce was still delivered by truck, by men who drove for two days straight to be the first to make the delivery. Being first meant that you were paid more. It doesn't sound extremely thrilling, but as depicted in the film, you get a real sense of the cut throat aspect of this life, the hardness of it. The other important factor to remember is that this is Film Noir. The characters are going to be dark, dark, dark. Even Nick, who is the hero, will have occasional moments of weakness and trouble. Because it is Noir, the villain will be crooked as heck. Figlia is unabashedly crooked and always working an angle. All other characters will have shades of gray making them interesting.

""Thieves' Highway"" is not the best Film Noir I have ever seen, but it is a little seen film that should have a larger audience. My main problem with the film is that the acting is very, shall we say, stylized. During this period, many Italian and French actors and actresses began appearing in American films, to make them more international, more exotic. Unfortunately, they frequently played prostitutes and Valentina Cortese is no exception. She plays Rica, a woman who lives in a hotel on the San Francisco Wharf, near the produce markets. She wanders around looking for marks. When she spots Nick, she invites him to her room, to rest, and to watch his truck. How seductive. She is never truly believable. Why would she be in a hotel in this area? The story would also have us believe that she and Nick develop a relationship. Again, didn't believe it.

The best performance is from Richard Conte. He is very convincing and subdued as Nick Gracos. Upon his return home, his exuberance shows. But unlike the two actors, playing his parents, he doesn't have a fake, thick accent or throw his hands up repeatedly. Nick is someone we might actually meet on the street, walking by, head down. That is the best thing about Film Noir. The main characters, in the best examples of the genre, are people we might meet in our everyday life. They are normal people trapped in a hellish nightmare. As Nick learns about his father's dilemma and decides what he has to do, he formulates these plans quietly, and convincingly. Other characters are burying their heads into shoulders to hide their tears and facial expressions, as though someone flicked a switch and said ""Emote!"" Conte moves quietly, forcefully through the story.

The majority of the film takes place at night, during the drive from Fresno to San Francisco and after the arrival at the docks, before the sun rises, when all of the buyers are swarming through the merchants, looking for produce. The streets of the dock are dark and forbidding and the perfect setting for a bunch of crooks trying to pull one over on small truck drivers.

Everything is depicted in a very gritty, realistic way. When Nick and his partner Ed (Millard Mitchell), show up at the farmer's grove, to load up the apples, Ed tries to cheat the farmers, without Nick's knowledge. The farmer begins pulling the boxes off of the truck, throwing them to the ground. Soon, Nick arrives and puts a stop to it, telling Ed to pay the right price. The farmers are very convincing. As Nick is driving north, throughout the night, Dassin creates a real sense of what it was like driving these trucks, on small highways, throughout the night. As the action centers on the Produce Market, it appears as though the film was shot on location. Everything appears very authentic, very real, adding to the feel of the film as a whole.

One of the great things about the film is how we hate Mike Figlia long before we ever set eyes on him. After listening to Yanko's story, it is clear to everyone that Figlia is crooked, even if Yanko doesn't want to believe it. Then, when Nick decides to put his life on hold, to get his father's money back, we feel even more hatred towards him. Nick is a nice guy, back from a hard journey, who just wants to settle down with his girl, Polly (Barbara Lawrence). Instead, he has to find a truck, find something to buy, drive it up to San Francisco, sell it for a profit, hopefully get some sort of confession or the money out of Figlia and return home. By the time we meet Figlia (Cobb), we already hate him, but we want him to be different. When he isn't, we are introduced to one of the more interesting Noir villains. He is almost determined to con every truck driver who tries to sell him something. When Nick first arrives at the dock, he asks people how to find him. Everyone warns him against doing business with Figlia, but he is determined. There is good reason to stay away from the crooked produce salesman. He tells the truck drivers one thing and then immediately tells others something else. Nick parks his truck in front of Figlia's stand and soon learns that he has a suspicious flat tire. Figlia tells him he can leave it there. As soon as Nick walks away, he reports the truck to the police. This is a minor example of the machinations, but a good one.

This is the last film Dassin would work on in Hollywood, before moving to Europe, to escape the Blacklist. ""Thieves"" is definitely worth watching, but it lacks some crucial elements to make it a truly memorable film. For all of the realism of the action and the surroundings, I find it difficult to believe the acting of some of the actors, especially Cortese. More subtle, believable acting from all of the actors would have helped make ""Thieves' Highway"" a great film, instead of just an interesting film.",1118793600,8,8067,4.6866619618913195

*** WARNING -- Plot points revealed ***

The engaging flick was written by A. I. Bezzerides, adapted from his own novel.

A happy warm Fresno in Sonoma Valley. The WW2 veteran Nick Garcos (Richard Conte) returns home after sailing around the world, with exotic gifts for all family members including his blonde fianc&eacute;.

Nick soon finds out that, while he was gone, his produce-truck driver father had been crippled in a trucking accident after delivering tomatoes to the San Francisco produce wholesaler Mike Figlia who did not pay the old man either. Upset by his old man's humiliation, Nick decides to take things into his own hands.

Soon Nick is on the road, hauling apples to San Francisco. He has an accident while changing his tire but his life is saved by his fellow trucker Ed, a shifty character who interestingly enough has stiffed his father in the past.

Nick finally makes it to Frisco.  He is looking for a place to crash since he has not slept for days on the road. He stumbles on to the produce-market hooker  Rica (Valentina Cortesa) who takes him to her hotel room -- not to make love -- but to let him sleep.

The moment of truth arrives soon enough for the refreshed Nick Garcos. He confronts Mike Figlia in a bar and punishes him for every pain he inflicted on his fellow immigrant truck drivers.

After his blonde middle-class fianc&eacute; leaves him for having no money, Nick realizes that he actually loves Rica and they drive off happily into the black-and-white sunset.

Lee Cobb is amazingly annoying as the ruff and gruff produce boss and we are really relieved when Nick finally gives him what he deserves. We go home happy after watching this one despite the stale characterization of Rica as the proverbial hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold.

8043771,5,B0006Z2NDQ,"An apple a day may keep the doctor away. But apples hauled on delivery, trucker falls prey to fast thievery. Who knew a fella had to endure such rumpus in order to acquire, transport, and sell fruit and produce? I now appreciate my groceries more. Thieves' Highway is a 1949 film noirish thriller. Richard Conte stars as Nick Garcos, a war veteran and a mechanic who, after an extended sea voyage, has returned home to Fresno, CA. He's saved up enough money to start his own business. But he never counted on coming home to find his father crippled and robbed, courtesy of a treacherous fruit & produce merchant named Mike Figlia (Lee J. Cobb). Out for blood, Nick, now a truck jockey, sets out on a 36-hour, 400 mile, no sleep haul from Fresno to San Francisco, his truck overloaded with sumptuous apples, these highly in demand so early in the market season.

Nick is partnered up by Ed Kinney (played by Millard Mitchell who is terrific). Ed is an opportunistic cat who himself had welched on paying a debt to Nick's dad. Except Nick has his eyes on the bigger prize. He wants to get even with Mike Figlia, him what casually commits perfidy in Frisco. Off they go to the City by the Bay, Nick driving ahead, Ed lagging behind on account of a drive shaft's effed up universal joint. So, yeah, we end up tracking two storylines. Because Ed himself ends up beset with his own sackful of woes.

Nick isn't your classic intrepid hero. He's brave but impetuous and naive in the ways of the fruit and produce trade. This and that obstacle conspire to torment him, from the near fatal fallout of his succumbing to sheer exhaustion from driving non-stop to the deplorable machinations of Mike Figlia. In Frisco, Nick bumps into a beguiling dame (Valentina Cortese), and so that's one more bit of jeopardy. But maybe Rica will prove to have a heart of gold. Or not.

Thieves' Highway deftly executes the mechanics of film noir, all hail director Jules Dassin, for whom this was the last American film shot before getting blacklisted. The tone is cynical. The hero is flawed. La femme est fatale. And whoever shot the cinematography deserves massive props. I loved the atmospheric play between light and shadow. A.I. Bezzerides submits a potent screenplay, and probably it helped that he had his own trucking background to plumb. The actors deliver compelling performances, from a determined Conte to that garrulous chameleon Lee J. Cobb to the calculating Millard Mitchell to the alluring, exotic, duplicitous, big-hearted, big-on-hugs Valentina Cortese. Call me a sucker or a hopeless romantic, but, even more than Lee J. Cobb's getting what's coming to him - and here I'll inject a big, honking ***SPOILER ALERT*** - I relished the sappy Cinderella ending.

8043774,3,B0006Z2NDQ,"No question back in the late 1940s, and now too for that matter, the plight of the independent owner-operated trucker was tough. Long hours, high fuel prices, stale coffee and cakes, all made worst if one was dependent on the weather or delivered perishable time-sensitive commodities. That is why in the 1930s and 1940s leftist truckers from Minneapolis and guys like Jimmy Hoffa (the father) tried to organize these types into the Teamsters Union. Not everybody got the message or had the opportunity to join as was the case with the trucker, Nick (played by Richard Conte), out in the Frisco town area in the film under review, Jules Dassins Thieves Highway.

The plotline is simplicity itself (the real plus here is the photography and the role of the vibrant streetwalker Rica, played by Valentina Cortese). Nick returned from war expected to settle down to a white picket fence existence with his fiance. Problem is that Nicks father, a farmer, was a victim of a cockroach capitalist produce market honcho, Mike (played by Lee J. Cobb), who crippled him up. Nick  vowed to make things right against this bad guy. And after a series of up and downs; selling produce at a good price: shacking up with a streetwalker with a heart of gold; being robbed on Mikes orders of the proceeds, being dumped by his white picket fence-loving fiance; and, finally giving Mike his just rewards he does avenge the family honor. And then sets up house with the streetwalker with the heart of gold (maybe not white picket but a house) as they trail off into the sunset together.",1388793600,,1565,4.771217712177122

I have listened to MANY film noir commentary tracks and this is by far the best I have heard. It even comes close to an education in film direction.
Another aspect of the film that I liked was the on location filming. There were very few studio processed scenes. Great Film ... I wish there were hundreds more like it!",1381449600,,724,4.215827338129497
8043776,5,B0006Z2NDQ,"""Thieves' Highway"" is that rarest of birds-a film like none you've seen before.  One lives life consuming food without giving a second thought how it got to our table.  The film follows the trek of merchant trucker Nick Garcos(Richard Conte) whose mission is not so much to deliver his goods for a good price but to avenge the treatment of his father at the hands of disreputable fruit wholesaler Mike Figlia(Lee J. Cobb).  The film follows Nick from the apple orchards to the road to the food distribution center which is fraught with perils from broken down rigs carrying heavy loads, ill-lit highways not to mention sleep deprivation.  Most of the film takes place at night which portends the danger Nick is in at every corner.  A similar effect was felt with the men carrying nitro through treacherous jungle terrain in Clouzot's masterwork ""The Wages of Fear"".  Conte gives a terrific account as everyman Nick who gets out of the army only to see the war isn't over at home.  Valentina Cortesa is absolutely stunning as the bad girl turned good when she discovers she loves Nick.  Cobb's performance suggests the gruff heavies that he would patent later in ""On the Waterfront"" and ""Twelve Angry Men"".  Director Jules Dassin is afforded a script here for his prodigious talents as a craftsman.  ""Thieves' Highway"" is a relatively obscure film deserving of the essential status that Criterion affords it here.",1372550400,,1412,4.894957983193278
