Out of Africa was breath taking.  So sad humans have to live there.
We should just be allowed to visit.",1366502400,,178,4.363636363636363

5016936,5,B006TTC5SG,my dad (who is 88) asked me to get this one....  Great movies and great memories for him,1435449600,,88,3.888888888888889
5016937,5,B006TTC5SG,"I was going to buy A Beautiful Mind, but Amazon was temporarily out of the single movie, but had the 4 piece collection of best movies for only about a dollar more than the single.  I had read in the paper that John Nash and his wife had been killed in a taxi accident, and I remembered liking that movie and wanted to see it again.  Russell Crowe did a great job portraying Nash.  I still have not watched Out of Africa.  I didn't care for the original, but i am planning to enjoy the re-run more on the DVD.",1433894400,,509,4.06

5016943,5,B006TTC5SG,"The transfer quality on these DVDs is very good and each film is on a separate disc.  The selection is a bit odd (Russel Crow meets Der Bingle?), but variety is a good thing.",1414540800,,174,4.117647058823529

5016947,4,B006TTC5SG,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description lacking, I decided to compile this list of helpful information below. I hope this will be useful for prospective buyers to know what they're getting:

OUT OF AFRICA: 1985 - 161 minutes - Director: Sydney Pollack - Starring: Meryl Streep, Robert Redford - Genre: Drama, romance - Plot: In colonial Kenya, a strong-willed baroness falls in love with a free-spirited big game hunter. PG

A BEAUTIFUL MIND: 2001 - 135 minutes - Director: Ron Howard - Starring: Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly - Genre: Drama, biography - Plot: The story of John Nash, a brilliant but asocial mathematician, and his life, love, and mental struggles. PG-13

ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT: 1930 - 136 minutes - Director: Lewis Milestone - Starring: Lew Ayres, Louis Wolheim - Genre: War, drama - Plot: A young soldier faces the soul-destroying horrors in the trenches of WWI. PG

GOING MY WAY: 1944 - 126 minutes - Director: Leo McCarey- Starring: Bing Crosby, Barry Fitzgerald - Genre: Drama - Plot: A young priest challenges a struggling parish to rise to new levels of understanding. G

Now let's crunch some numbers. This set costs $13.82, and contains 4 films. When we divide to find the value of the individual film you're getting, we find a cost of $3.45 per film, a good deal for this little and diverse set of award-winners. I hope this information is useful to you.",1397260800,39,1431,4.777327935222672
