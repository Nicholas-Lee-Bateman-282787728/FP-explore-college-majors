8572293,5,B00000IBQ6,"This is an invaluable dvd for horticulturalists, botanists, landscape designers & architects, master gardeners and passionate home gardeners.  I don't mean to insult Martha Stewart or P Allen Smith or HGTV but, this isn't one of those cutesy superficial trendy type American gardening programs for the average home gardener.  Like most programs produced in the UK, this is pure in-depth quality programming by professionals who truly value nature, gardening and conservation.  The DVD runs for many hours, taking you through 4 seasons of pruning, weeding, propagation techniques, winterizing methods, container gardening, design history and methods, entomology (insect science) and more.  The video of the gardens is high quality and absolutely breath-taking.  My husband and I are professional garden designers, arborists and horticulturalists and we could watch this program almost every day!  It's truly as entertaining as it is educational.  We would prefer to be working and living there but, this is the next best thing ;D
The classical music is also very relaxing and enjoyable as well.  I highly recommend this dvd to every passionate gardener!!
We also play this dvd in our reception area for customers to view.",1403222400,,1220,5.417989417989418
8572294,5,B00000IBQ6,"As a Master Gardener who spent much of my childhood roaming around Wisley with my parents I found all the behind the scenes information fascinating and very useful. Here we learn about the extraordinary lengths taken to protect figs through an English winter, how designs for formal bedding schemes are made and what it takes to propagate and maintain the thousands of plants used, as well as getting glances into the departments which identify plant pathogens and various varieties of apples from samples which are sent in.  This is a long DVD covering all the work which goes on through the different seasons in order to present this spectacular garden to the public.  Techniques such as grafting, propagation and pruning are shown very clearly and there is also plenty of footage of the gardens at their peak.",1384819200,,812,4.91970802919708
