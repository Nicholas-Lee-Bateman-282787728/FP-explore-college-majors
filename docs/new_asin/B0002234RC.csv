2054758,1,B0002234RC,"The movie was HORRIBLE! And then they release a big special edition DVD. Movie maker: There's a reason the movie got horrible ratings and is the number 3 worst movie ever on IMDB.com!
And now they try to revive it yet again with some stupid dance DVD. Why would anyone want to dance how people danced in one of the worst and most embarrassing movies of all time?!",1088899200,,363,4.352941176470588
2054759,3,B0002234RC,"i mean the movies isn't that great and its not that bad...its in the middle. I was given the impression that it was gunna show ALL the moves..or maybe just like the hot ones....some of them are hot..but not the ones that you guys have been working on. If u wanna learn how to wave and tick...and just see some dancing then buy it.

 Why is it that Marques Houston walked in on the freesytle but said he had music....Omari was there. And they prolly live together whyd Omari ask what hes been doing since the movie...man u know..your his brother...just like the movie..it wasn't that well thought out....Chris Stokes if you ever read this You got served 2 better be much better...and for the instructional..give us moves that we wanna learn not those others...ok",1088812800,2,761,4.62962962962963
2054760,2,B0002234RC,"You Got Served sucked really really bad. I condemn the film. When a DVD that spins off of You Got Served is released that's even more entertaining than the thing it spun off of, that's really bad.

The instructions are step by step and then combined, giving them time to be able to perform the entire dance without too much pausing and rewinding.",1359158400,,308,4.421052631578948

2054779,3,B0002234RC,"The workout is great, but the dance moves are EXTREMELY fast.  If you don't have a dance background, I would say find something else because I could see you getting frustrated easily.  I have a bit of dance background and I found myself even scratching my head and getting angry.  I still do it though because you do work up a sweat, even if the moves aren't right lol.",1336262400,,369,4.318840579710145

2054792,3,B0002234RC,"I liked the dances in this, though they weren't my favorite ones from the movie, and I Love Shane Sparks- though he was only in it about 5 minutes.
The dancers are great, the ONLY problem I had was it was a little hard. The moves weren't hard, but they only show you once or twice then move on, and then do it soooo fast. Some other tapes will have you repeat in segments so you can remember more. But you can always rewind and do them over.... But for the price, I have to say it was a great deal!",1186876800,,498,3.9405940594059405

2054796,5,B0002234RC,"You Got Served:Take It to the Streets is the off the chain and great.

2054797,5,B0002234RC,Great video for beginners to learn sophisticated moves to take to the dance floor. Dave Scott is a very good instructor. The camera work isn't annoyingly fancy like other video's causing unnecessary rewinds to learn the moves.,1120176000,21,226,5.135135135135135
2054798,5,B0002234RC,"After reading the reviews I thought the DVD was going to be horrible, but it's actually pretty good, and so far one of the best instructional hip-hop videos I've seen (I own a Groovaloos DVD and Tina Landon DVD and have used Darrin's Dance Grooves), and the instruction is also better than some teachers I've taken classes from.

In general, nothing beats actually having a good teacher and choreographer so they can critique your form and technique.  However, I very happy that the instructor, Dave Scott, DID give some tips on technique instead of only showing moves to copy.  (The fundamentals section is too short, but pretty good).  I only wish he gave more tips on technique.

He also breaks down routines at different tempos (which most instructional videos do not do), and this is essential!  I think it's important to get the fundamental moves right at a slower tempo first, rather than rushing through the movements just to get through the song.

He does turn around from the camera a few times so you can follow the moves without confusing your left and right, but I wish he did that more.

The only main problem I had is that there are only two real routines you can learn, and that's it's not very ""Take it to the Streets"" oriented.  No breakdancing instruction, really, or street dancing tips.  So if you want to improve your breakdancing, this isn't the best DVD to buy.

Overall, it's a good DVD for the price and I would highly recommend for intermediate to advanced dancers looking to expand creative moves, improve their ticking/waving, and get ideas for choreography.  For beginners, it would still be a good investment but will be fairly difficult.  I would suggest that instead of matching the moves, it might be good to just mirror the instructor so you can at least get used to moving your body in certain ways.",1120089600,68,1835,4.696875
2054799,2,B0002234RC,"Well.... I was really excited when I found out that 'the official learn-the-dance moves DVD from the creators of the hit film YOU GOT SERVED!' was being release. I didn't particularly enjoy the movie as the acting was terrible and there wasn't much of a storyline...but the dances moves were BANGING! But to be honest when I bought the take it to the streets DVD...I was disappointed. The moves didn't turn out to be so `hot' and me being a quick learner I thought that the routines were too rushed. Out of the whole 54 minutes, the only thing I did enjoy, was watching Omari Grandberry's freestyle (which only lasted about 3 minutes)!",1114646400,15,635,4.628318584070796
2054800,4,B0002234RC,"The movie was good, making you want to buy this DVD to learn the dance move.  I think it was a great instructional video, but it went by too fast.  It took my sister and I hella times to get it, and we are easy to learn dancers.  It's just that if you want to learn the moves slow, I recommend buying the VHS.",1114128000,11,309,3.796875
2054811,2,B0002234RC,"I bought this DVD becuase I really wanted to learn the dance moves in ""You Got Served"" and was extremely disappointed.  The only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those, I don't know.  The freestlye section at the end is fun to watch, but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video.",1106784000,7,383,4.162162162162162
2054812,5,B0002234RC,"This movie is hot, before I watched it I was always gettin served by the other guys and girls on my block.  But now that I know how to dance just like in ""You Got Served"" I am servin them fools up left and write.  Whenever I walk down the streets peoples gettin served, 'like wow'.  Whenever I order fries at the Burger King peoples gettin served, 'like wow'.  Whenever I see my baby's mamma peoples gettin served, 'like wow'.  I'm talkin all the time, for real, I served this one fool up so much last week he still served.  BAM.",1105833600,9,529,4.188118811881188
2054813,4,B0002234RC,"I would recommend this DVD for fast learners and people who have had at least one year of practice in dancing. It's great but very tiring. It mainly focuses on hip-hop dancing but there is the occasional breakdance move there as well. I think people will enjoy it just like i did!

Peace, Take care...

2054814,1,B0002234RC,"The ""you got served"" movie was awsome i loved it so much i bought it.. So i thought i would buy the ""take it to the streets"" too but when i saw it it was the most dissapointing clip i have ever seen. it had 2 short routines from the movie, a little interview thing with breakdancing and krumping, and their ""hot & new"" routine that wasn't even that good. i am a b-boy and i do a little bit of hip-hop and believe me there are better things to waste your money on than this",1104451200,9,472,3.9270833333333335
2054815,3,B0002234RC,"I liked the ""You got served"" movie and actually wanted to learn the moves and how they did what they did. I did not want to learn the actual routines of what I saw in the movies due to the fact that I can't use them at the club or to freestyle. The only reason I gave it a three was that during the middle of the DVD the instructor teaches a basic point of ticking, waving, and popping. That actually meant something to a basic person that doesn't have a clue about dancing. To me ... it meant nothing. I think 2 people can get this DVD. A person that wants a session of ticking, waving, and popping that lasted around 3-4 minutes or a person that wants to learn routines done in the movie that you also need a couple other people in sync with you to make it look actually nice.",1102896000,6,778,4.058441558441558
2054816,3,B0002234RC,"I am so in love with The Groovaloos, I just had to come here and tell ya all. If you want a really awesome instrucitonal DVD, they have 2!!!! I foung out about them because so many of their dancers are in You Got Served and have even danced with Janet Jackson! OMG! I bought both 'Groovin With The Groovaloos' DVDS and they are so cool and so great to learn to do REAL dance moves and 'grooves'. I totally feel like a Janet dancer now... or like someone in You Got Served. The Groovaloos are my new idols. I totally want to move to L.A. and become a Groovaloo. Not to diss the You Got Served instruction, but The Groovaloos they are so hot and talented. OH, you can totally check them out at [...] They even have a big show happening soon and I am totally going to fly or drive to L.A. to see this. I'M GONNA KEEP GROOVIN WITH THE GROOVALOOS!!!",1095033600,5,844,4.121212121212121
2054817,3,B0002234RC,"Dave Scott is good-no doubt. But would make learning easier if the footage is inverted meaning the viewers will learn from mirror image instead i have to constantly remind myself to move the opposite limp that he is moving tho Dave does perform the choreo once (yes only once) back facing the camera so you can follow him.
Besides this point.. everything is cool. Definatley not for beginners.",1093478400,4,393,4.794117647058823
2054818,3,B0002234RC,"First off I'd like to say that You Got Served really was a horrible movie, but the choreography was very well done, which maybe evened it out to an okay movie, if they had just cut out all of the acting it would have been a good movie.
Now what might be misleading with this DVD is that you may think that this DVD will give you all the routines, or at least the best routines from the movie, however they don't, the two routines they teach are the dance sequence with the all girl's crew and a routine from the semi-finals. The semi-finals routine however, isn't even Wade or Elgin's crew, its the routine with the crew that the choreographer, Dave Scott, was leading.
Along with this there is a third routine that Dave Scott choregraphed, that wasn't in the movie, and what is almost a small documentary on some b-boys, b-girls, and krumpers. There is also a special feature where Omarion and Marques Houston do some cheesy talking and then Omarion does an okay job of freestylin.
Now the best part of this DVD in my opinion, well perhaps the most well instructed, is the segment on how to tick and do the wave. I think that segment was very well done, even if it was kind of short.
So If you want to learn/improve on ticking and waving, go ahead and get this DVD, but if you're lookin for the really badass routines from you got served, well...guess ur gonna have to look somewhere else.",1089763200,38,1390,4.391472868217054
2054819,3,B0002234RC,"I first watched the You Got Served movie and loved it. I love hip hop dancing and break'n and this movie rocked. It was a high energy movie. I loved the movie so much that once the You Got Served Take It To The Streets Dance Instructional Video came out, I had to have it. The Dance Instructional Video sucked. It is not for beginners. It is very fast paced and you have to do alot of rewinding to follow along. Dance video shows some routines they do in the movie but do not go in depth or break it out by steps. I was very dissapointed and feel that a better dance instructional video could have been made!",1089676800,10,608,4.117647058823529
