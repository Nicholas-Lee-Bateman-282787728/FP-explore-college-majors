7283222,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"Worst B movie I have seen for a so called ""big budget"" 2015 movie. This can not be the one that people are raving about that was at the box office this year. This is my husbands favorite story, so we were excited to watch it. There is no way this was done in 2015 with a big budget. I think this is the old one and I was miss led.

7283231,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"such a bad movie, the acting was horrible",1472428800,,41,4.25
7283232,3,B00ZL4Q7NE,"Movie description on viewing app described this as a ""Big Budget"" film. Perhaps a ""bigger"" budget than other films but in comparison to other recent Biblical stories to light up the big screen, this one slightly misses the mark. Particularly, the lines of ""Goliath"" which are clearly dubbed showed signs of cutting corners in places where they thought people wouldn't notice. The story of David as told in the Bible was written in the movie as in the Bible. Thus not taking anything away from it. The ""filler"" screenplay writing didn't transition all that well, though. The characters are in one moment of a scene and without any kind of lead, the next scene jumps days, even weeks into the future without warning or cluing the viewer in. Also there were certain anomalies that likely happened in the post-edit. Like thunder crashing when the scene is showing clear, blue skies or the voice dialog fading in and out of volume while in open scenery.

Some positive points are that movie retained the Biblical story in tact. While the acting wasn't an ""A-list"" performance, some delivered not in dialog but in presentation. Some really captured what it was like to be their character. Especially, unknown Miles Sloman who really seemed to express the level of frustration of David as he was continually passed over as being nothing more than ""shepherd boy."" Overall, the movie was as good as one would expect from a B-Reel my main disappointment was that the description, the media, and trailer had made this out to be an epic depiction of the classic tale. When in reality, it was simply a mediocre Bible flick.

Did I enjoy it? Yes.
Was it a ""big budget"" cinematic experience? No.
Definitely worthy of the free watch with Prime.",1472428800,,1728,4.795302013422819

And then David prays...and more shouting...and more praying. That's pretty much the whole movie. And then toward the end Goliath calls for his ""best sword"" from the blacksmith, then proceeds to fight David with the exact same sword. You would think in the end there would be an awesome fight scene, but to no avail there was none. In fact not a single swing of a sword was swung. And in the end David just casually chucks the rock after a few knarly stare down circles much like in the fashion that a child would.

7283388,5,B00ZL4Q7NE,"An excellent video production of a great Bible event found in 1 Samuel chapter 17.  The movie depicts King Saul's lack of confidence in David as a warrior, as well as the struggle between David the shepherd and his brothers.  As the armies draw up in battle array, Goliath is first shown cursing and goading the Israelites, and eventually David too.  Eventually King Saul accepts David's offer to fight the giant.  But David turns down King Saul's offer of armor and a sword.  David remains the humble shepherd.  David states his confidence is in the ""living God"".  When David's stone strikes Goliath's forehead, the giant falls to the ground with a thud.  Although verse 51 says David then ran to Goliath and cut off his head with the giant's own sword, the movie doesn't show the beheading, just the sword's downward action.  So this visual depiction should not disturb small children.  At first glance the actor cast as David might not fit one's expectation of this Bible hero.  But the Bible says in 1 Samuel chapter 17 verse 42, that David was a ""youth"".  And that he was ""ruddy, with a handsome appearance"" (NASB).  So perhaps the movie casting isn't too far off.  The lead actor portraying David certainly gave a believable performance.",1466035200,,1243,4.774647887323944

7283453,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"The bulk of the movie is simply everyone declaring David can't win, and David declaring that with God's help he can win. It ends up being a long build up to a boring fight.

Goliath isn't the least bit intimidating. He's a tall, out-of-shape guy that likes to yell. Oh, I'm scared:) Any well-trained soldier would tear this guy to shreds. If the antagonist of the movie isn't scary, and the whole climax of the movie is based on a battle with him, there really isn't any tension to drive the plot.

King Saul looks like a weakling. According to Biblical accounts, he was head and shoulders above the rest of the Israelites. An imposing king Saul is necessary to drive the story line, because then everyone wonders why the warrior-king isn't going out to face the giant. Instead, this movie presents Saul as a mushy, gutless figure. In the Biblical account, Saul is a tormented individual who ends up jealous of the young shepherd who kills the giant. The Biblical character is multifaceted. The Saul in the movie is one-dimensional and flaccid.

The final fight scene with Goliath is boring. The two circle each other for what seems like an eternity, before David hits him in the head with a rock and then cuts off his head. In the Biblical account, after the beheading, the Israelites chase the Philistines and a humiliating defeat ensues. But, this movie doesn't include the exciting battle. Why not?

There is a subplot of a love story between David and Saul's daughter, Michal. But, this subplot is devoid of any chemistry.

The strong point of the movie (if there was any) was the acting of the young man who played David. While none of the acting was great, at points he did come across as believable.",1464998400,,1707,4.639072847682119

The idea of how the people may have reacted to David insisting to fight Goliath may be true and some of the content may hold true, but overall the acting was terrible and the presentation and budget was a grade D or F.  Great story that could be a great blockbuster movie, but both the writer and director got seriously hung up on a very drawn out story line of the debate between David and his brother and fellow Israelite's on whether or not he was crazy to fight Goliath was beyond boring.  The Biblical account of David and his rise to a great warrior King of Israel is awesome and could be made into a wonderful big budget movie if it followed his entire life.  The same could be said for his son Solomon.  But this movie was just awful all the way around. the premise that David is offended by the philistines and their mockery of God and David's faith that he will defeat Goliath because his God will not be mocked is good.

Goliath at one point even threatened to ""sue"" David. Suing Tim Chey (Director) to recoup losses > 50 million worth is not a bad idea. Never before in the history of cinema have more red headed and/or blond-haired, fair-skinned, blue eyed Hebrews graced the Valley of Elah. How many actors and horses stepping infront of the cameras during dialogue could not be counted. Goliath is played by an overweight wrestler who had dubbed dialogue (repeated ad nauseam) and a bad costume - by the way the stone hits Goliaths helmet not his head in the film. Looked like there were about 40 extras on either side of this low budget ($50 mil?) conflict - All they did while not being addressed by Saul was walk in the background as if they were lost.

7283554,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"Worst movie I've ever watched in my entire life. I have seen high school AV projects that were better. The acting was atrocious, the costumes were red sheets, they shot it in one location, you could literally see the same people walking in circles to give the impression of more people and I think it had 3 horses in it, they superimposed the same horse EIGHT times passing by the camera during ONE conversation.

The guy who played Goliath, they had him on a loop too, he stood in one spot calling them the same names. The guy said a total of about 12 words the entire movie. I'm in awe that someone spent money to make this and whoever the investors were, need to sue them. We kept asking, is this a parody, is it a joke? Nope. They should have gone to Party City for their costumes, they would have been better. They should have hired people off the street, it would have been a better production.

I'm not paid by anyone to review movies, but in my 50+ years, I've never seen a worse production of anything on stage, tv or film and I've seen Spongebob, which is about as bad as it gets. The only thing this movie is good for is maybe a drinking game. Every time you see the same horse, drink. Every time you see the same 10 people walking in circles, drink. Every time Goliath says the same thing on a loop, drink. No one should be sober or coherent during this movie.  Seriously, please use this 90+ minutes of your life to sleep, watch paint dry, dig the lint out of your belly button, contemplate the meaning of life, dig for change in your cushions, floss your teeth, .... anything other than watch this movie. shame on Amazon for even adding it to Prime, it's a crime against humanity.

7283581,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"The makers of this movie managed to take a small portion of the life of one of the most interesting biblical characters and create one of the most boring movies Ive ever seen. They used dramatic license to fill in events that led up to the battle between David & Goliath.  The bible did a great job of communicating everything of importance about this epic battle in one chapter that can be read in about 5 minutes. The movie adds nothing of value and nothing thats even remotely entertaining or inspiring of faith. Its basically 90 minutes of a WWA knock off version of Goliath talking smack, the Philistines showing brutality, the men of Judah showing cowardice, David showing faith and eventually convincing Saul to let him go into battle which ends with ...Never mind read your Bible, but read all of Samuel 1 and 2. As long as the filmmakers had an hour and a half and a big budget, why not make a movie about more than just one small portion of the life of King David?

Side thought  at a time when women were considered property to be protected and used in negotiation, Sauls daughter is right on the battle line watching the festivities and constantly interacting with David, asking him not to go to battle, accusing him of doing it just to get her hand in marriagesure, that may have happened.  Why not donate the money to a Christian charity rather than make such a bad movie. One positive note-beautiful rendition of How Great Thou Art by Daniebelle Cagas during the closing credits.  Was she named after gospel great Daniebelle Hall? Maybe the makers of this film can make a feature length film covering that question.",1463184000,,1630,4.606896551724138

7283731,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"My one-star rating is very generous.  If you want to try this feature the fast-forward button will be your best asset.

This production was a waste of film and an even greater waste of effort to corral the rather large cast onto some desert area.  The sparse description for this movie drops the term ""big budget"", and if this is actually true it was also a colossal waste of money.  Not much talent was wasted, for there was little to start with among the few actors with speaking lines.

To be fair, I suppose the biblical story was followed somewhat accurately.  The first 84 minutes is devoted to a few Israelites whining about having their tails whipped by threatening Philistines; particularly a very large one named Goliath.  None of the Israelites are willing to face Goliath, who spends 40 days (pretty much all of the first 84 minutes) shouting at them.  Soon one Israelite named David steps forward and tries to explain that his faith in God gives him the strength to challenge and defeat the giant Goliath, but the rest of the crew works very hard to talk him out of it.

Finally around minute 84, despite all the advice to the contrary, David casually walks out to face Goliath and flings a small rock at him.  The rock finds a good landing on Goliath's right eyebrow, stunning the giant into a pre-coma.  This gives David the opportunity to approach Goliath and run him through with his own sword.  Another filmed minute shows all the Israelite nay-sayers cheering David, then the movie goes to credits.",1461715200,,1517,4.661654135338346

Maybe these were good actors but their acting didn't seem to be that great. Sometimes it seemed like David was reciting scripture rather than speaking these words for the first time. as for casting why do most of these actors appear to be european descent with blond hair etc? Perhaps there is something i am not familiar with in ethnic appearance. The costumes were well made if it was for a Sunday school play. None of the leather parts looked real. Goliath was one of the leading roles. He was probably not as strong in the thinking department and bigger in the physical department but he seemed especially too dumb to carry out a good fight at hand to hand combat, not very clever at all. At the beginning of the movie the quotes made made this seem like it was going to be quite interesting but it rapidly fell apart shortly after that.

7284077,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"With so many horrible reviews, why would I watch this? Honestly, there's three reasons.
1. Many Christians don't know what a good movie is. If a biblical movie does not follow the text to the ""t"", it's automatically bad. So, I can't trust those reviews.
2. Many non-Christians don't know the Bible text, and any Bible movie would be bad. So, I can't trust those reviews.
3. Probably the same reason you will: to see if it's really as bad as everyone else says. And it is.

David quoting New Testament passages is bad enough (Without faith it is impossible to please God), with a good script, good directing, good acting, it could be a forgivable offense. But, the fact is, the screenwriter breaks every rule of creative writing, particularly when it comes to show, don't tell. Instead of showing David in a battle with the lion, he simply tells two men to watch out for the lion, because he killed his mate, and she might seek revenge. Most great movies would have shown David in an epic battle arising victoriously after a heated and exhausting battle.

One reviewer here says Goliath is on a loop repeating himself over and over. It's true. He just repeats the same lines over and over. If he has any other lines, I sure don't remember them. I won't debate the size of Goliath here. Whether he was actually 6 to 7 feet tall or 9 to 10 feet is a debate elsewhere. What I will say is, this Goliath is neither terrifying nor is he enough to scare a toddler, much less an entire group of trained warriors.

Speaking of trained warriors. The Israeli army is portrayed as a bunch of untrained, undisciplined, and pathetic wimps hiding from the neighborhood bully. While they were terrified, it wasn't against a pathetic Goliath as portrayed in this movie.

At the end of the day, you will undoubtedly disregard this review and the others, and will watch the movie for the same reason(s) I did. And, like myself, you will have been warned. It really is that bad.",1458345600,7,1957,4.551136363636363

7284087,5,B00ZL4Q7NE,"Interesting and entertaining. A good portrayal of how things must have gone up until the end. It showed all of Saul's army standing around (very close to the action) while David slew Goliath. The Philistine army were doing the same across from them on the other side of the action. I find it hard to believe, (considering the Israelites fear of this ""giant,"") would subject themselves to danger. I could be wrong about that, and there may be something I'm not considering. The other thing I found odd is that they showed David and Goliath walking around in circles very close to one another for some time before David acted. At times it looked like Goliath could almost reach out and put his hand on David's head. And I'm not sure David could have slung the stone with a slingshot being so close to Goliath. But I could be totally wrong, since with God, all things are possible. :) All that said. I did like the movie, and I would recommend it.",1458259200,,944,4.494186046511628

7284119,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"One of the most inspiriting and extraordinary Bible accounts is once again retold in a cinematic manner reminding us it is best expressed from the true literary source. The best production quality of Tim Chey's film version of David and Goliath is the movie poster. Although an ambitious attempt to dramatize the events leading to that ultimate battle of faith the movie spears and stabs itself in every area, each scene possible. The foremost flaws are Chey's direction and writing.
Among the director's weakest results are the inconsistent, often overblown performances ranging from poor to earnest to mediocre, a lot of yelling, threats insults and shouts among the actors. Miles Sloman is a sincere David, grunting, mean faced Jerry Sckolosky is a tall, beer-belly Goliath, Paul Hughes is the anguish overwhelmed King Saul abandoned of God's support. There is also the jealous oldest brother Eliab in Joesph Emms and the soon worrying sick daughter Michal portrayed by a pretty Makenna Guyler. Other actual and fictional Bible characters are thrown in or spoken about to mix up the drama that is frequently cartoonish.
Tim Chey's script include well-known passages and reminders of Bible's events. Like other Biblical retellings it runs off the tracks and goes its' unscriptural path. It was a chief flaw to leave out the colorful, assertive Biblical character Joab, that was Chey's decision. He was replaced by a fictional army chief who's more favorable presence in the film is killed off too soon.
The location shots in Africa seemed authentic. However after you are trying to ignore the amateurish costumes, props, hearing the overplayed music and seeing overdone cloud effects there is the confronting the fact the filmmakers are either professionally careless or uncaring of the significance of David and Goliath's story. It is not impossible to enjoy this movie depending on your mood or attitude. It is a big mistake to begin watching this rushed, pasted together production with high expectations of an faith building experience. David and Goliath is rated PG for sword and choking violence, threats of deaths appearing less troubling than a Saturday morning cartoon.",1458086400,,2180,5.213675213675214

However, this was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen.  I've seen better acting and props in an elementary school play.  I think someone made a last-minute decision to glue part of their belt to Goliath's helmet.

Lowlights of the movie:
1) 15 minutes of the King begging for someone to fight Goliath.
2) 30 minutes of people screaming at David about how he is a fool to fight Goliath.
3) 15 minutes of unarmed Israelite soldiers wandering aimlessly back and forth in those horrible red mini-skirts. 4) 5 minutes of horses wandering back and forth across the set with that awful (and loud) clop, clop, clop sound.
5) 5 minutes of bad actors holding their face in their hands because David doesn't succumb to their screaming demands.
6) 7 minutes of David turning down weapons suggested by others.
7) 4 minutes of Goliath and his leader repeating that this shepherd most be coming to deliver a message, not fight.
8) 6 minutes of David and Goliath walking in a circle with Goliath screaming the same lines repeatedly.
9) 4 seconds of the rock bouncing off Goliath's forehead.
10) 3 minutes for Goliath to fall in slo-mo.
11) The (suddenly) armed (with sticks) Israelites chase the Philistines.
12) David gets the girl.

I know there is evidence about the event of the biblical account of David & Goliath but I wasn't sure if this was the Monty Python version of David and Goliath or not due to quite poor acting...some enough to laugh at. But I guess if you can look over the poor acting, poor costumes and things I don't think quite came from the bible, it can still make you think what would it have been like. Why did a David have such a strong faith in God and the crowd around him seem to have lost faith. But I think anyone seeing anything like this in real life it would have a good impact.

Unfortunately, I did watch all of the movie and it just kept getting worse. The best part of the movie was the incredibly accurate costumes. They look as if they were made by moms for a 4th grade skit. King Saul's main general had a helmet with grey netting fabric that was supposed to look like chain mail. Too bad no one noticed that chain mail came along about a thousand years later.",1457222400,,800,4.524137931034483

D; Good?
G; You will do this thing.
D I will do this thing.
G; Good.
D; You say good? Is it because I will do this thing?
G; Yes, Good, you will do this thing.
D; I will.
G Good.

This is not hyperbole In fact I'm minimizing. It's worth watching because of that alone and that alone wouldn't be funny if they were trying to be funny. It's like a cross between a poor mimicry of a failed monty python sketch and a bennigton commercial. Um, the tribes of Judea don't need ethnic diversity, or, you know, British accents, the point of most of the old testament stories were that they were one people, semites.

With the exception of biblical qoutes the movie is a little embarrassed about the whole god thing. I don't want to spoil this, I couldn't, I'd like you to see it, because, it's likely I don't like you. I think I started watching it because the lead in was ""Big Budget Epic"" Heh.

Once I did hit that mark i fast forwarded to the 1:17 mark to where David finally meets Goliath. I mean I'd made that far so I had to see to won right? Well of course I knew who was going to come out on top and aside from Goliath the only other losers are the people who made and acted in this movie. No less than one minute into this thing you already realize you're are going to be watching a very bad movie, if you stick with it that is. The costumes look as if someone tore up old curtains and made tunics or whatever out of them. Helmets appear to be one quart sauce pots with the handles removed. The accents and the dialog I can't even begin to describe how bad they are. When David and Goliath finally do meet up it's more like a nauseating WWE face-off that lasts forever before anyone throw the first punch so to speak. I'm certain I could beat up Dave any day of the week and honesty the big guy doesn't really scare me either. I mean could they have at least found an actor who was somewhat believable as a giant? Now only because I'm assuming already knows who won the showdown I don't think i'm ruing the ending for anyone. I mean who hasn't heard this story a few times already right? Anyway when they face off David appears to be like only six feet away from Goliath so why did he need to use a sling shot? He was close enough to just throw a good sized rock at the big ape and knock to the ground. So Goliath has met his maker, the crowd roars, David and some woman who i'm not even sure what she has to do with anything ride off into the sunset. Actually I'm only assuming the young couple lived happily ever after because as soon as David was hailed a hero I picked up the remote and put an end to David, his girlfriend, Goliath, the men wearing curtains and the all of the guys with soup pots on their heads. If I made this movie I would never tell anyone. If I acted in this movie I would deny to anyone that ever said ""Hey I saw you this movie the other day"" Deny, deny and deny some more because anyone that had anything to do this poor excuse for a movie should hang their heads in shame and never admit to having anything to do with it.

7284560,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"Be warned there are some spoiler here, but I feel anyone should read them before clicking play.

I'm offended. And let me tell you why. It's not that David, the Shepard Boy turned King is portrayed as a whiny brat that--because he played the harp for someone once--is suddenly given audience with the King to beg his pardon to go get himself killed at every opportunity. Its not that lack of faith in David or God that EVERY OTHER PERSON portrayed in this film shows. Its not the musical score that consists of one song replayed over and over without reason--seeming to get their money's worth out of the rights they paid to use it in the soundtrack. Its not even that the special effects for this ""Big Budget"" film suck worse than the SF I set up for a Haunted House I did one year on a shoestring budget of $100.

No. I will tell you what really offended me about this film by summing up the first hour and twenty minutes of it in two sentences. ""David, you can't do it."" and ""David, don't try!""

You say this once to give it feeling. You say it twice to press its meaning. But the third, fourth and fortieth time? You're just bludgeoning your audience. The writer couldn't figure out how to show the impossibility of the situation so tried to tell the audience. Over. and over. and over.

But since this is a review, lets touch on some of those other points. David is one of the few true hero stories of the Bible. But he's not portrayed as God's soldier here. He's portrayed as a whiny kid who walks into the middle of a battle and bugs Saul until the king just basically says ""Screw it, go get yourself killed!"" I did not like David in this movie. I don't blame Saul at ALL for sending that David off to face Goliath.

I'm also not exaggerating about the music score either. You will hate that song by the time the credits roll. And I liked that song. And they killed it for me. Thanks Jerry.

The Special Effects? Here's a tip should anyone from that department read this. Karo syrup and cocoa powder. Pour the syrup in a clear plastic cup and mix in the powder until it is darker than blood. You want it darker if you're putting it on a light surface to make it look realistic. Putting what looked like cherry koolaid on Goliath's face does not make for any realism.

As for the lack of faith? This was someone's unilateral love letter to God, and they wanted to hammer home the concept that faith is stronger than steel. The proof of that was visual. It took 2 seconds...one stone thrown.

There is so much promise in this story that was never even touched upon. You can get all these extras but you can't pay for a harpist to let us hear him play? Why didn't David put on that armor? He didn't even touch the King's sword! But he swung Goliath's rather smartly. We could have had romance with that harp. We could have seen comedy with those oversized weapons. Could have felt urgency with the battles that were never fought, blood that was never shed, and the stomachs that were never fed. That might have explained the lose of faith in the others, to see and hear and experience their suffering during the siege.

 That being said, a 1 Start rating is giving this movie too much credit. I wanted to turn it off after the first few scenes, but decided to carry on and it just got worse. I laughed, I cringed, I yelled, and I turned the movie off.

All I have to say is, what is up with:

There are some exceptions, such as the lead actor playing David, but many actors are terrible and the villains are also ridiculous stereotypes.  The script is repetitive and the dialogue and acting is laughable. And to make it even more silly, there's one or two sequences involving Goliath shouting insults that's reused over and over throughout the movie.

David & Goliath offers some unintentionally funny scenes but other than that, there's no reason to watch it. It was more interesting watching with the director's commentary on the DVD, although he repeated himself a lot.",1447113600,12,716,5.059322033898305

It would've made the movie stay true to way the bible depicts the event. Nonetheless, it's a great movie to see, own and inspire. I think you'll equally enjoy it.",1446854400,,561,4.394230769230769

7284585,1,B00ZL4Q7NE,"This is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen.
The costumes and make-up are ridiculous.
The acting is incredibly bad.
The script, though they attempt to follow scripture, most of it is a far stretch.
Most of the movie as far as I was able to sit through before stopping it was not following scripture.
""Big Budget"": By what and who's standards. It's even worse than all the spaghetti westerns.
Knowing I'd never be able to get a refund I decided the next day to at  least see what the battle between David & Goliath was like. Keeping with the rest of this ""BIG BUDGET"" movie it was even more incredibly ridiculous.
The most impressive part was the Philistines make-up. The black eye shadow really was an experience in EVIL.
Goliath was probably the most entertaining of all the poor talented armature actors in this movie.
When asked why I watched any more of it after stopping the first time, all I could offer is; there's a certain amount of pleasure in watching something as painfully bad as this movie.
Everything past the poster and title deteriorates and an exponential rate..
I wish AMAZON would do a better job of selecting the movies they offer. Or at least rate them in their description clearly enough that no one would have to spend anything for something this bad. Even though they do have reviews etc it would be in Amazons interest to make it possible for viewers to decide without having to read through the reviews.",1445817600,44,1434,4.623529411764705

The actor playing 'David' is well-cast as David, a role that plays right to his strengths. The strained relations between David and Eliab provide one set of themes for the story, as well as driving much of the action. David handles his end of it pretty well, although the king could have been a little less static in his portrayal of King Saul. The woman actor works very well as Saul's daughter, and her scenes with David are used well in establishing some of the inner workings of David's character.

The last fight scene and other action sequences usually get most of the attention, but there are also some worthwhile ideas in the story (which are really the focus of the original Biblical story that are developed well enough.

So I resort to nitpicking because somehow as wonderful and impressive as it all was and is, I wasn't swept away, but still give it a perfect score because they never compromised God's Word.",1441843200,2,967,4.682352941176471
