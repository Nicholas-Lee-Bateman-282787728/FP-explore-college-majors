8015326,5,B0001NIYUO,"Come hell or high water, German cinema achieved high marks with the epic masterpiece ""Das Boot"". This film allowed movie goers throughout the world to observe the inner workings, terse dialogue, underwater battle danger and suspense, and full throttle action involved on a German submarine in the Atlantic during WWII. Warfare took on a whole new meaning with this motion picture. Suddenly the audience was plunged under the surface of the ocean when the Captain shouts out, ""Dive, Dive!"" We know what he means now. We accept the duty of a submariner and throughout this story - it affects our empathy, catharsis, and sense of realism within a powerful, incisive, and meaningful crescendo. It has a superb dnouement.

Throughout, we are alone in our thoughts as the U-96 and her crew sink towards the ocean floor to escape depth charges. We feel pain, fear, trembling, suffication, and varying emotions - one associates with war - by allowing our senses to be overwhelmed at times by the intense action and realism within their assigned mission. In many ways, this film altered the way people look at war. Exceptional acting, scripting, film editing, cinematography, direction, sound effects, and motion picture soundtrack work - all contributed to creating this classical war movie, that set a unique standard for all future war movies. This was to put the audience into the battle. This was accomplished even with sub-titles and a tough experiential plotline.

Within this film, we are exposed within a relentless war story to such gritty realism, life & death pressures, excitement, deafening sounds of underwater battles, and profane military jargon - that one has to caution those with a heart condition or a sensitivity to such violence - to consider watching the edited version of it on a smaller screen. All unities adhered to. Written/directed by Wolfgang Petersen, produced by Gnter Rohrbach; starring Jrgen Prochnow, Herbert Grnemeyer, and Klaus Wennemann; adapted from the German novel ""Das Boot"" by Lothar-Gnther Buchheim.",1333756800,5,2035,5.201219512195122
8015327,5,B0001NIYUO,"With all of the versions of DAS BOOT floating around, one would wonder which is THE version to buy.  First of all, if you are considering the full Television Series--this is probably the one to buy, since the German version has no subtitles.  And, if you have not figured out how to make your DVD player CODEFREE or found one (there is a large online auction that has many such players) and you are a serious DVD collector, it is about time you bought one!!  They are not that expensive....before this came out on DVD, I scrounged the studios to find a VHS player that was multi-region, and it was used and cost me $275!!! I bought it to view the then-available 6 cassette version of the original television series (6 parts).

So, if you really want to get the feeling of being in a 50-man Type VIIC U-Boat AFTER the Happy Times of the early Battle of the Atlantic, you must watch this version.  There really is nothing like it--before or since.  Most highly recommended!",1168387200,6,971,4.488636363636363
