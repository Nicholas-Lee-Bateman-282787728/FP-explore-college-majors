3029890,4,B000YIYJKU,"The first Asterix film to be released in an English version, 'Asterix and Cleopatra' begins with a witty and self-conscious prologue about dubbing and its inadequacies, with an Egyptian giving an onomatopaeic rendering of hieroglyphic speech (e.g. on a chicken symbol he tweets).  The film itself is a vast improvement on its predecessor, 'Asterix the Gaul' - character movement is still a little stilted in relation to background, but those backgrounds are now spectacularly, vividly detailed.
The film opens with the hectoring of a shrewish Cleopatra echoing over her Egyptian empire, the intricate magnificence of her buildings matched by the mass labour needed to build it.  Pert and slinky, she is the screen's most beautiful Egyptian queen, and she is placing a bet with Caesar - who thinks her empire is decadent - that she can have a temple of unparalelled pomp built for him.  Unfortunately, her leading architect, Edifice, is hopelessly inept, his grasp of engineering shaky.  Faced with the threat of becoming alligator chow, he enlists the help of his old friend Getafix and the warriors Asterix and Obelix.  Despite obstacles at every turn - pirates; sabotage by rival architect Artifice and his sneaky sidekick Crewcut; the displeasure of Caesar, using his prodigious chameleon spy, who can blend against decorated walls, pillars, skies etc.
It's not just the recreation of Egyptian architectural brilliance and local colour that marks 'Cleopatra' as an improvement, but the increased confidence of the animators to tell their jokes visually, rather than simply relying on a funny script.  Highlights include Edifice's death-trap buildings, like a Hollywood classical set designed by Dr. Caligari; the labyrinthine imprisonment of our heroes in a pyramid whose wall decorations include an Egyptian Santa Claus; one of those historical explanations for famous ruins we always find in Asterix, here the noseless Sphinx, caused by Obelix scrambling the monument to get a panoramic view, causing the souvenir merchants to hack away at their replicas.  There are some splendid musical interludes - Cleopatra's odd, operetta bath; Obelix's ravenous hallucination conjuring a Homer Simpson-like dream-world of food; and Artifice and Crewcut celebrating a dastardly plan.  The abstract choreography of the building-work itself echoes Stanley Donen's 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' barn-raising sequence.
Made in 1968, a period of domestic upheaval in France, the satire at the expense of strikers is a bit off, but it doesn't sour the pleasure of this, the most inventive of all Asterix films.",1020038400,,2603,5.409876543209877

8232956,4,B000YIYJKU,"I caught this delightfully energetic and amazingly visually sumptuous 1969 70 minute film on YouTube.  Although ""Asterix"" is a French-themed comic by Goscinny and Urdezo, I watched ""Asterix and Cleopatra"" (hereafter ""A & C"") in English.  I'm not sure if the film was dubbed or originally shot in English, but there is a wry hint that it is dubbing at the beginning of the film which explains that since most of the film is situated in Egypt and Egyptians speak in hieroglyphics, the English dubbing may not synchronize with the mouth movements.  At any rate, I thought the dubbing (if any) was rather satisfactory.

First, let's get to the plot.  Julius Caesar is visiting Cleopatra at her palace and criticizes her kingdom's soft decadence.  The outraged queen bets Caesar that her people have the will and know-how to construct a summer palace within 3 months.  She tasks the inept architect Edifis with the challenge and the constant fear that if he fails, he will be fed to the crocodiles.  In desperation, Edifis flees to Gaul to enlist the help of the diminutive but crafty Asterix, his rotund, pugnacious pal Obelix (and his tiny but devoted dog Dogmatix), and the druid Getafix and his super-strength potion.  With their help and the potion, the Egyptian workers now have the power to erect blocks and pillars at astounding speed.  But opposing Edifis, Asterix, and company are Edifis's jealously bitter and devious rival Artifis and his servile helper Crucut, who attempt to sabotage the construction.  Also standing in our heroes' way is Julius himself, who uses his invincible army to try to stop the building and this win the bet. Can our heroes help Cleopatra win the bet and avoid imprisonment (and death by crocodile)?

If you are an Asterix fan, chances are you'll enjoy this slavishly faithful animated version of the book.  As another reviewer mentions, ""A & C""'s animation is reminiscent of a 50's or 60's Popeye cartoon, with all the vigourous, lively movement, fighting, violence, and property destruction.  In particular, ""A & C"" reminded me of a Gene Deitch Popeye cartoon, with the slightly surreal tone (especially Obelix's out-of-left field daydreaming about food). Besides the rollicking punch-ups, ""A & C"" retains most of the ""Asterix"" book trademarks, such as the punny names (Edifis, Artifis, get it), the effects of the super-strength potion, the reason Obelix (usually) doesn't get to taste any potion despite his earnest attempts, and even the ornate, luscious scenery and backdrops (a triumph in any cinematic year).

  But even if you are an ""Asterix"" novice, I think ""A & C"" will give you a satisfying crash course in Asterix lore and will entertain you with its sheer vitality, sturdy and suspenseful plot, and outlandish characters alone, no matter what.  Although a considerable amount of fighting goes on, it is cartoonish and non-graphic and thus safe as well as fun for young children.  I highly recommend this extraordinary effort.

P.S.:  Some viewers might be offended by the depiction of African-Americans with bulbous lips.  Personally, I wasn't since practically every character sported an exaggerated anatomical part.  Also, while I was generally okay with Asterix's and Obelix's vocalizations, they were a tad too similar to Looney Tunes cartoon voice-work, especially Obelix's, who sounded like Mel Blanc's Lenny ""Duh George"" impersonation.  I consider these insignificant flaws in a movie that showcases what the ""Indomitable Gauls"" are made of.",1390521600,,3497,5.137809187279152
8232957,4,B000YIYJKU,"I have 2 of the Asterix comic novels, ASTERIX THE GAUL and ASTERIX AND CLEOPATRA and this animated feature, which was the first one made of Goscinny and Uderzo's european comic hero is a delight! I first watched this movie on You Tube! One can figure that Goscinny and Uderzo are fans of Segar's Popeye since Asterix the Gaul goes on sea trip adventures and has enormous strength like the funny sailorman Popeye! The overseas animaters look like they were influenced by Max Fleischer's animation of Popeye, since there is good comic exaggeration in the fight scenes! Especially when Asterix and Obelix fight the pirates and Obelix bounces one of the pirates off his stomach to Asterix who punches him back to Obelix's big belly! Soon the pirate ship is sunk and the lead pirate was still confused and in shock about the outcome!

The verbal humour is in the names, Asterix, Getafix the Druid with his potions, Chief Vitalstatistix, Cacofonix the bad musician etc.! Asterix also benifits from the magic potion that gives him enormous strength like Popeye's spinach. When Edifis the egyptian archectect needs to get a palace contructed for Julius Caesar the egyptian slaves gulped down the magic potion and they then stacked the huge stones to form the walls like they were as light as a feather! The action happens in time to the music and the songs are fun while moving the plot along. Evil archectect Artifis and his bald henchman Krucut ( those funny punny names again) scheme to stop the palace's constuction so Edifis will be thown to the crocodiles by Cleopatra! Their song, done to a fun jazzy beat as Artifis sang the recipe for poisonous arsonic cake is both catchy and funny! Caesar had his spy spy on the Gauls and the spy is clearly a master of camaflage and disguise as he blended into the backround and tranformed into a block of stone to hide among the other palace stones! Those gags have a Dave Fleischer cartoon feel to me!

 Obelix also sang about his love for food and Cleopatra's dancers sang about their queen's bathing are fun music  numbers also! Throughout the film the characters kept praising Cleopatra's nose which plays like a running gag. Running nose gag!? Excuse me! Only complaint I have is once again there is no scene selection to skip around to different scenes. No chapter stops either. The soundtrack sounds good on my Onkyo stereo receiver with external speakers so how it sounds partly depends on your sound setup! Some remastering would punch up the faded colour but it still looks good if you turn up the colour on your set. Belevision is the studio credited for the animation of this film. I would like to see again Belevision's animated movie versions of Herge's ADVENTURES OF TINTIN which were made long before Nelvana animated Tintin's adventures. Glad I ordered this disc for just $12.00!",1389312000,,2834,4.777551020408163
8232958,3,B000YIYJKU,"The animation was clunky, but I'd have to say this was pretty amusing at times.  Don't go into it expecting too much and you'll probably be entertained.",1370304000,,152,4.62962962962963
8232959,2,B000YIYJKU,I did not see anything indicating that the zone was not a local zone and I cannot play it on my dvd player!,1354147200,,107,3.6956521739130435
8232960,1,B000YIYJKU,"The audio is terrible, none of it is in French, the drawings are pedestrian and racist.  I would not recommend this product to anyone who enjoys the Asterix stories.",1290816000,,165,4.689655172413793
8232961,4,B000YIYJKU,"I was delighted to find Asterix and Cleopatra on DVD.  My brothers and I came across half of it on the Disney channel years and years ago, and it is one of our favorite childhood memories. Out of all the Asterix movies, this is our favorite!  It has the best songs, and Obelix finally gets to have some magic potion!

However, the sound quality is very poor on this disc--you have to turn up the tv really loud to hear it!  However, at the moment it is the only way to watch Asterix and Cleopatra.  If it ever gets re-released in a higher quality edition, I will definitely buy it again.",1170288000,,587,4.252252252252252
8232962,4,B000YIYJKU,"Here is your chance to see Asterix and Obleix as a cartoon. This 72 minute animated movie was dubbed into English by Disney Studios. It is faithful to the books and fun to watch. Espeically when Obleix takes out to thump the pirates. This is the second animated Asterix film to be dubbed. Sound quality is great.

In this film our little warrior from Gaul, Asterix, goes to Egypt in order to help a friend of their druids. They need to build a Palace that is being constructed to impress Caesar on; the orders of Cleopatra. Problem is, she only gave the architect three months to build the whole thing, or else. If you are an asterix fan, and do not know French...this is a must for you to view.",1109462400,,695,4.346153846153846
