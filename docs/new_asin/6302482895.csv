483188,1,6302482895,"Bizarre doesn't even come close to describing this nightmare of a movie, even calling this a ""movie"" is questionable. The story goes something like this: Santa lives in a crystal castle hovering above earth, (i am not kidding!) where he seeks the help of children from all over the world. What the children do is beyond me. They look confused, and are forced to sing songs to Santa. Oh, did I forget to mention Satan was here!? Because, you know that Satan in a holiday movie makes for a classic! Anyway, Satan is up to no good and influences the children on Earth do naughty things. So santa uses his ""dream probe"" (which by the way looks like a satalite dish with a ear sticking out from it.) to see what the children dream about. He also has in his arsnel of gadgets some weird Hardware devices like a talking computer with big red lips. So do you get the plot so far? Don't worry neither do I! I should also mention that there is a ""poor little rich boy"" who spends most of his nights alone, Appearantly his parents are always out partying and have no time for him. So Santa poses as a waiter and gives his parents ""rememberance potion"" to remind them to stop neglecting their son. He tells them that if they have love in their hearts that they will not forget, but quickly mentions that if they have no love that the ""potion"" will burn their throats. This part was actually quite funny. Really I had to turn it off because it was just that awful. I think the screenwriters where taking some serious LSD when they wrote this one. So if you like terrible acting, films without plots, and poor over dubbed voice acting, you might want to give ""Santa Clause"" a shot. Honestly though I love indie, camp, and cult flicks, but even I couldn't watch this all the way through.",1101600000,3,1772,4.405487804878049
483189,2,6302482895,"A seriously twisted 1959 Mexican Christmas movie that warps the Santa Claus mythology by moving his North Pole workshop to a floating cloud in  outer space, populating his household not with the traditional elves but  with dozens of annoying multicultural children singing native homeland  songs and wearing indigenous costumes that reinforce every unfortunate  ethnic stereotype including bone-haired African kids. Valiant yet witless  attempt to meld Santa's mythology with that of Jesus: Santa's aided in his  never-ending battle against Lucifer's servant (the prancing, Spock-eared,  fuzzy-slippered, red-spandex-clad devil Pitch) by Merlin the magician, his  four wind-up mechanical reindeer, a batch of vaguely obscene machinery for  spying on Earth, and an annoyingly cloyingly sweet, relentlessly cutesy  little tot named Lupita, who only wants a dolly for Christmas. Watch for  the three ""naughty"" little boys who plot to kidnap Santa, knock  him out, steal his toys, and make him their slave. This incredibly weird  flick warped the minds of thousands of impressionable American kids in the  1960s and 70s when it was shown at shopping malls during the Christmas  season, allowing parents to drop off the kids and do their holiday shopping  while the young impressionables pondered this abysmally-dubbed, annoyingly  scored (if they're not playing ""Jingle Bells"" in the background,  they're playing ""Silent Night""), incredibly slow (Santa visits  four households out of Earth's six billion on Christmas Eve, and still  finds time to shoot rockets up Pitch's butt, moonlight as a cocktail waiter  (! ), and get treed by a dog). A mind-bogglingly pointless flick that  effectively saps the expected joy and delight of seeing a Santa Claus movie  through pitting Santa versus Satan. Well, after all, he is called *Saint*  Nick. If you're like me, you saw this given the ""Mystery Science  Theater 3000"" treatment, and were all the better for it...it's even  funnier that way, and at least *intentionally* funny.",968198400,13,2017,5.467532467532467

483299,3,6302482895,"While I enjoyed the utter insanity that is contained in this movie, I do have one complaint with this particular release: The subtitles.

The subtitles look as if they were typed by someone in a mad rush; MISTAKES EVERYWHERE. That could be easily forgiven if they were in a color other than WHITE. Definitely a poor choice of color for a movie with a lot of white smoke, white scenery, and white flashes. Yellow would have been a much better choice. If you're going to use white text for a film like this, at least provide a thick black outline! As of this review, I am attempting to find an alternate SRT/SUB file to run in VLC so I can present this movie to my family on Christmas, because while there's a charm to horrible dubbing, others may not see it that way (My family comes to mind).

This cracked fairy tale begins with Santa and his workshop in the clouds, not the North Pole.  His neighbors on nearby clouds are Merlin the magician and Vulcan the iron forger.  Instead of elves as his helpers, Santa has kids from around the globe.  Wait till you see the kiddie parade of nations.  It is a very poor man's version of Disney's It's a Small World.  The African contingent alone could set back race relations a million years.  The story is about Santa wanting every child to be good and Pitch the devil trying his worst to make children be bad.  The dance number in Pitch's hoary netherworld home has to be seen to not be believed.  Great so bad it's good film.  The MST3K folks riffed the English-dubbed version and that was great.

But first the look of the film: thanks to the Blu-ray transfer, it looks light years beyond the previous dollar-store disc I have, and it's a treat to see it in all of its widescreen glory. However, that widescreen is only 1.85:1 and NOT 2.35:1 that you're promised. In addition, while the image appears crisp and clear early on, as the film progresses the image grows murkier, rougher, though at many points the colors are quite noticeably over-saturated, as if VCI failed in color-mastering this new disc. There's also a link on the special-feature that is supposed to lead to more content but it doesn't work, which is particularly irritating. Despite these issues - which aren't exactly minor! - it's a pleasure seeing a finer, widescreen print of it. While it isn't a complete success, transfer-wise, it's still a terrific movie.

The story is about how Satan sends his demon to earth,to try and turn all the children against Santa Claus. The film has very bad acting,with unknown actors and actresses. You can tell they dubbed the dialouge in English,so it was probally made in another country. Mexico,I think. It's just a bad Christmas film,and it would be very disturbing to kids. It's just very strange. Although there are some funny moments. Especially when Satan tells the demon that he'll be punished by being forced to eat ice cream if he fails in his mission lol But overall,the movie is really bad....unless you wanna have a good laugh or two.

The only worse Christmas movie I can think of (other than the drivel on The Hallmark Channel -- don't miss ""The Night They Saved Christmas"") is ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"". For ""Santa Claus"" to be worthy of inclusion in such humble (which originally meant ""low to the ground"") company is some sort of compliment.

I watched the MST3K version of this film, so I had the benefit of hearing the wisecracks and jokes, and my daughter and I still decided it was the worst thing we had ever seen.  The pace of the movie is excruciatingly slow, the plot...such as it was...could only be described as something extracted from a dull witted 3 year old, and the cinematography was horrid.  Don't question how Satan and Santa end up on the screen together, rather rue the fact that someone thought it a good idea.  If this movie was attempting to cater to the chronically depressed, then it succeeds towards that end, and if you don't happen to be a depressive you will be by the time the end of this movie finally drags into view.  I apologize for not attempting a synopsis of the story, but I do occasionally suffer from depression myself, and I don't want to trigger another episode.
At any rate, suffice it to say that a sentence is entirely too long to sum up the plot of this stinker anyway.  Several people have commented that this movie is so bad that it is good, but I believe that it is so bad, it is horrible.  My recommendation is to have a lobotomy, amputate a limb, drive nails into your skull, or paste yourself with honey and lay on an anthill before you subject yourself to the torment that is this film.

He was a bratty boy in Angelitos Del Trapecio(1959) and Marisol's friend in Ha Llegado un Angel(1961). Antonio Diaz Conde(Quinceanera) does a good job writing music for the film.

Did you know, for instance, that Santa's headquarters floats in the clouds above the North Pole? (Who lives in the other two castles we see floating nearby?) Did you know that Santa (Jos Elas Moreno) employs a multinational group of child laborers in his workshop? (Perhaps the elves' union wanted wages that were simply too high so their jobs got outsourced.) Most importantly, did you know that Santa had a vast intelligence gathering organization that helps him battle the devil and his minions directly? Here Satan sends Pitch (Jos Luis Aguirre,) the comic relief devil to battle Santa largely over a trio of Mexican boys and a relentlessly cute little girl, Lupita (Lupita Quezadas.) Lupita resists evil by not stealing a doll, but the boys give in to their baser instincts and devise a variety of ridiculous plans to interfere with Santa. There's also a story of the importance of parental love, which Santa is able to induce in the life of a rich boy by impersonating a waiter and making his parents a cocktail that apparently contains dry ice.

If all this makes you go ""Huh?"" you are not alone. Santa's creepy mechanical reindeer (which laugh maniacally and turn to dust if they stay out too late,) the ultra-creepy dance of the two-faced dolls (mostly edited from the MST3K version,) the dance of the devils, and a guest appearance by Merlin the Magician (Armando Arriola) who is allied with Santa in the fight against good and evil will ensure you rapidly progress from ""Huh?"" to ""What the...?!?"" All this is secondary to my very favorite feature of the film, and that's the singing. Santa himself sings occasionally, and the scene of him singing as if he was possessed during the sleigh loading procedure is priceless. Despite Santa's badly dubbed songstering, the most entertaining thing in the movie is in the first ten minutes of the film when Santa introduces different nationalities of children helping him in his ""international toy factory."" The kids sing a song (or do a dance) somehow vaguely connected with their ethnicity or nationality with astounding and mesmerizing effect. I was particularly amused by the entries from China and the U.S.A., but the entry from Japan is in a league by itself for harmonic discord and features a note previously undiscovered by musical historians (you'll see why.)

I love this movie: it has horrible production values, is terribly dubbed, features lots of strange gadgets (I particularly like the eyeball on an extendible stalk and the ear on an oscillating fan,) and has one of the most bizarre plots of any movie ever, and is neck-and-neck with ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" (also highly recommended) for weirdest Christmas movie in history. The acting is terrible, the performances are truly over the top (especially from Pitch and Santa,) but this copy has beautiful color (far better than the MST3K print) and could not be more fun to watch. I highly recommend ""Santa Claus"" for fans of B-movies of any generation. Make watching it a Christmas tradition!",1295740800,6,3366,4.934744268077601

483604,2,6302482895,"This campy movie would make for classic Drive-In movie fare except for its winter setting.  This is a cheap movie filmed in Mexico with lots of bizarre studio sets.  The pacing is very slow especially in the beginning when all of the various kidnapped (yes!) children of the world are introduced.  Its best viewed while decorating cookies, folding laundry or some similar activity.

For most kids growing up Santa is the Lord.  We pray to him (write letters), leave offerings (cookies and milk), study his teachings (be good for goodness sake), obey his commands (be good or else) and expect him to deliver the goods in exchange (toys).

This movie takes the Santa God to the next logical stage - fighting evil.  Santa of the movie lives above the Earth where he kidnaps children from all over the world and enslaves them to build toys in his work shop while he laughs like a maniac, plays the organ and spys down on the children of earth with is advanced pre-Sharper Image gadgets.  Remember this is the good guy.

Meanwhile the great Satan calls forth one of his demons to spread evil among the underprivileged children of Earth as well as the ""poor"" rich kids.  Santa I mean Satan torments children in their dreams and waking thoughts to steal.  One poor girl just wants a dolly and her parents can not afford one.  She tries so hard to be good but the demons just won't stop tormenting her.  Unfortunately the all powerful Santa has a superhero like weak point - he can only visit Earth during Christmas Eve.

Over all the movie is interesting in its weird take on the whole Christmas season and the every changing Santa Claus mythology as well as its parallels to the religious myths.",1292457600,2,1689,4.624161073825503

483606,2,6302482895,"Consider me disappointed.  ""Santa Claus"" had a awesomely stupid premise built for all sorts of amusement: Santa Claus lives in a castle from outer space, his minions are little multicultural children (he mostly captured against their will), he's fighting against Satan, and Satan's minion named Pitch has to making kids do bad things or else he'll be forced to eat ice cream.  Those scream the attention of it's-so-bad-it's-good, but after trying to stay awake for an hour an a half, it's really so bad, it's boring.

When it's not boring, the movie can be very peculiar.  And by peculiar, I mean 'scary the heck out of little kids'.  The design of the movie is so bizarre: the castle had a computer with very suggestive lips, Santa can peeve into children's minds using a dream device (""Eternal Sunshine"" and ""Inception"", be damned), he rides toy reindeer that eerily laugh, and at one point of the movie, there's a dream sequence where the poor little girl is surround by life-size dancing ragdolls with faces in the front and back of their heads; why not add a ""Silent Hill"" score to play in that sequence while it's at it?  It's so appalling to watch, yet amazing all the same.  It definitely has a creative spark in its design, I'll give it that for positive terms.

Although the concept of Santa Claus fending off hell's minions seems high, in reality, it's the working day at St. Nick's workshop.  He read letters, asked a merlin to use his science to make magical contraptions, listen to legal advice from his minions, prepared to travel around the world, all at a very lengthy arduous pace.  When the film began by introduced Santa's helpers from multiple countries, it took SEVEN MINUTES to introduce each nation of the group, including a non-existent middle-eastern country called 'Orient'.  Nevermind that their singing national tunes that have nothing to do with the holiday, why did that sequence have to be this long?  It could've been shorten to one minute, and that would be enough to cover the entire yuletide united nations.  This movie is padded by its own expositions, so much so that there's not much of a conflict between St. Nick and Pitch.  Even when there is, Pitch's actions are nothing more than goofy pranks (pushing the chimney, heating a doorknob); if I was the king of the underworld, I would tell Pitch to stab Santa, burn him in front of the lives of children, and then eat him.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oogie-Boogie/dp/6305949980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oogie Boogie</a>&nbsp;is a bigger threat to Christmas than this lowly villain.

I really wish ""Santa Claus"" could've done more with the idea. This might be asking too much for a B-movie, but if it's a B-movie, I expect campy goodness even if it's unintentional.  The slow pacing and uneventful drivel make this a drowsy viewing; I wouldn't be surprise if kids fall asleep watching this, which is probably the movie's intended audience.

483660,4,6302482895,"As a kid, I saw this film every Christmas at kiddie matinees. It was a tradition, even though it's as dizzying an experience as other movies that bent my young brain from ""The Wizard of Oz"" to ""The Birds"". As an adult, I'd mostly forgotten the film until the video generation. No company bothered to release this on VHS, but somehow I found a copy in the $3 bins one Christmas. The VHS tape was recorded at the 6-hour speed, tracking errors from start to finish, drop-outs from cheap manufacturing, etc. It actually put my VCR at risk to even play the tape! But that's ancient history, since we've reached the digital age.

I fully expected to buy 5 or 6 copies of this film before finding a satisfactory copy. The only other edition I own is a lo-fi off-the-air treatment on MST3K. This is the first appearance I have found on DVD, so my expectations were very low (due in part to my endless cynicism earned over the years.) The print is not restored -- and frankly, it's doubtful any historian will ever bother to restore this baby -- but it's still very nice considering the origins and what can usually be expected. No extras or anything like that, which is fine. I don't need filler that I will watch once, if that. The more space available on the disc for the movie itself, the higher the bitrate can be expected. The print is spotty in places, but mostly clean, the brightness and contrast look fine, and the color saturation is bold while never resorting to being hot and muddy.

You can read reviews on the film itself all over the web, I'm just letting you know that for an obscure treasure like this, it's a safe purchase. And the film will likely captivate the younger modern kids still.",1223424000,5,1699,4.47741935483871

483663,4,6302482895,"Okay, I'll admit, I haven't seen too many movies about Santa, but out of the ones I have seen, this Mexican version is by far my favorite.

The first 20 minutes or so of the film are drowned in politically correct boredom, where all of the countries of the world receive special recognition, reminding you why you never want to attend a graduation ceremony if at all possible.

But the film picks up soon afterward.  We discover that Lucifer doesn't want Santa to have a successful Christmas this year, so he choses Pitch (one of his devils) to be in charge of wrecking Santa's trip.

Pitch figures: Why stop there?  Why not spread evil in other ways as well?  So he attempts to get a little girl named Lupita to steal a doll.  She refuses because she wants to be good, so Pitch finds three other boys to tempt.  He gets them to throw rocks at a store window, and when Santa sees this through his weird talking-telescope he ain't happy.

When Christmas Eve comes, Santa winds up his laughing mechanical reindeer and flies his sleigh down to Earth.  You see, he actually lives in outer space, ABOVE the North Pole.  Pitch gives Santa all kinds of problems, stealing his sleeping powder and his ""flower to disappear.""  As a result, a viscious dog chases Santa up a tree, cornering him.  So Santa has to call on Merlin the magician for help.

Because of all the problems Pitch causes, Santa is only able to visit Mexico City, and by my count he was able to make four different households.  Yet the movie implies his trip was a success, and so everyone's happy at the end, and Little Girl Lupita gets the doll she wanted after all.",1167436800,7,1627,4.467796610169492
483664,3,6302482895,"An interesting mixture of mythologies run throughout this film, where a decidedly 'pagan' Santa Claus is in cahoots with Merlin, and fly about in a space ship. If you look closely, one can even detect a very pentagram-like 'star' in a prominant position in his laboratory. The reason why Santa can travel to all the homes on his schedule in one night is compliments of Merlin's magic dust, which Claus carries with him in a bag attached to his slay.

A devil named 'Pitch' attempts to thwart Kringle's efforts at every turn - his most impressive effort when he appears to a man in a dream, and whisperes into his ear that the house in on fire, precisely when Santa is roaming about the house, so he unleashes his vicious dog to run him up a tree, where he remains for the better part of the night, while Pitch laughs maniacally. Santa cannot escape therefrom, because Pitch had previously cut a hole through the magic dust bag.

Stereotypically, the Lokian Pitch presents a remarkable appearence, completely red with large horns, tail, pitchfork, and pointed ears, as he stalks about the evening causing mischief where he may, materializing in a sulphurous plume.

A poverty-stricken single mother and her little girl are in danger of not receiving anything for xmas, so the major part of the plot revolves around Santa being able to get to her and fulfill her wishes. Paradoxically, the only reference to xianity is in her prayers, although it is Santa that 'answers' her materialistic pleas.

This film is more or less an 'underground' classic, probably because of the repleat occult references which runs in the face of the typical tales of the so-called ""jolly old elf"", although through some simple research, one will discover the 'pagan' archetypal origins of this legend, which remains a cultural alternative to the judeo-christian mythology. Surely a quirky faerie-tale, yet quite amusing for what it is.",1135296000,,1912,4.910216718266254
483665,4,6302482895,"Far out in space, but directly over the North Pole, lives Santa Claus in his castle in the clouds. From his majestic home, he oversees the Christmas preparations handled by his team of children from around the world. Though, it seems they spend most of their time performing regional songs in a trance-like state. All seems to be going well this year, until one of Satan's devils, Pitch, is ordered to cause Santa trouble again. As Santa Claus spies on the children below with bizarre gadgets that look to be stolen from Peewee's Playhouse or Sid and Marty Krofft and prepares for his annual journey by gathering supplies from his cohorts, Merlin the wizard and a magical blacksmith, Pitch is busy on the ground teaching children to hate Santa Claus and to steal and vandalize. Pitch focuses his energy on three wicked brothers and a poor little girl named Lupita who is desperate to get a doll for Christmas. Lupita's resistance is unyielding, however, and Santa is determined to reward the unfortunate and tormented child. The three bad little boys, on the other hand, are playing right into Pitch's hands. A fourth little boy is also a subject of concern. The boy is rich, but he's also a good little boy who is neglected by his parents. In order to grant the request in the child's letter, Santa will have to remind the parents how much they love their son, something he does by drugging their drinks while making his rounds with his disturbing, wind-up, albino reindeer that have a vampiric reaction to sunlight. For the most part, though, it's all an epic battle of wits between Santa and Pitch, on which the fate of Christmas all depends!

In 1959, the world of cult-film was given a magical Christmas gift in the form of ""Santa Claus,"" a Mexican film by director Rene Cardona. This brightly colored, completely backwards story of Santa vs. Satan has got to be one of the most bizarre films I have ever seen, surely produced by some sort of ""Church of Santa Claus."" Despite its utter weirdness, though, it is a highly enjoyable annual experience. People often talk about ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,"" a film I have yet to get around to seeing, but I can't imagine it holding a candle to this wonderful travesty. Truth be told, I'm sure this ""children's film"" would succeed in giving many children nightmares, but for the adult who gets a kick out of the occasional bizarre film, this is one for the library! Santa is downright creepy with his inappropriate laughing fits and the odd faces he makes as he plays his organ for the child laborers he uses instead of elves. And, since when does Santa live in heaven and battle Satan? More importantly though, what's up with those freaky toy reindeer that turn to dust if the sunlight hits them? ""Santa Claus,"" despite being badly dubbed (and, according to various sources, badly edited for the dubbed version) and having plenty of print scratches and flaws, is a must have for the collector of Christmas or bizarre DVDs.

  Still, this version of director Rene Cardona's brilliantly flawed surreal masterpiece is like a Ken Russell Christmas fable.  It's metomorphic, yet simple and crude.  It has wonderfully bizarre music and set design, as well as beautiful costumes, colors, and lighting (unless this film was originally B&W and I'm not aware).  I loved the regional representations of the children, and the awful english dub is obviously a cheesy B-movie fan's lemon or love.  I love it.

  The print on this DVD is fullscreen and has severe specks and scratches, the picture quality is rough at times...  And either a digitally remastered audio track or print has been presented here.  It's not really specified on this Westlake Entertainment DVD release.  There is NO DTS track, though-- that seems to be incorrectly listed as a feature of this particular 2004 Westlake Ent. DVD release here on Amazoncom.

  But it's still worth it to see a goofy gem of an X-Mas film, full of wild ideas and imagery (A TALKING CHILD LOCATOR? YIKES!)--Some of which is very much a precursor to the newer much beloved shows like Pee Wee's Playhouse and HR Puff-N-Stuff (one never knows).  Fun film for the whole family in this edited up version for the US audiences.  Pitch the devilish demon is harmless pseudo-relgious/spiritual nonsense, while ol' Saint Nick is portrayed like a GOD.
