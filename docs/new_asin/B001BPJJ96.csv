3497630,5,B001BPJJ96,Fun Movie - teenage daughter and mom both enjoyed.  My daughter has been hooked on the band (The Click Five) and their music ever since.,1233705600,,136,4.44
3497631,5,B001BPJJ96,"This movie was just a great film to watch. Who didn't obsess over a band or singer growing up? It is overall a fun film to watch with friends because you can relate to the craziness of it all. However I didn't care for the review on the box that said it was ""high school musical with a twist"". This movie is much more cleaver and a lot less gushy.",1231718400,3,347,3.9714285714285715
3497632,1,B001BPJJ96,I ordered this over a month ago and have emailed company. did not receive item or response.,1231459200,,91,4.411764705882353
3497633,5,B001BPJJ96,"This is a great movie that any fan of Click Five or corny movies will enjoy!  I would not recommend this movie to viewers who are looking for a serious movie that has a great plot and dialogue, but if you're looking for a great time and hilarious dialogue I think that you would enjoy this movie!",1229731200,,296,4.192982456140351
3497634,5,B001BPJJ96,An excellent movie. A great story and plot that makes any female who has ever been a 'fangirl' nostalgic. The dvd itself has great behind the scenes features and music videos. Any fan of Alona Tal or the Click Five MUST buy this!,1227398400,,229,4.348837209302325
3497635,5,B001BPJJ96,"This was one of the cutest and funniest movies I've seen in quite awhile. The whole idea of it seems rather absurd but it contributed to the hilarity of the show. The actors were good and the music was great! We watched it and then turned right around and watched it again in the same night. Although it is not a deep plot it's a must see for anyone, especially ""Click 5"" fans.",1227398400,,377,4.178082191780822
3497636,5,B001BPJJ96,"Okay, so I know there's gonna be someone out there who gives this a bad review saying it's a ""don't waste your time"" movie... So first off, let me clarify, this is NOT the next Oscar contender.  It wasn't meant to be.  But, IN the full spirit of the movie, I have to say Taking 5 Rocks!  It's freakin Hilarious!

I'm a mom of six kids.  One of which was super cranky last night.  So in desperation at 1am I put it in (having just rented it for my kiddos to watch) and sat rocking the toddler back to sleep.  LOL!  She would've been alseep MUCH earlier had I not jarred her awake every 5 minutes or so with serious Laugh Out Loud laughter!  Yes, it's very slapstick and silly and completely random at times (okay, a lot of times!) But Holy Cow, was this movie funny!

At first, after I watched it, I would've given it 3-4 stars.  But, now the next day, finding myself quoting the dang thing and giggling like a freakin teenager, I have to give it 5 stars.  The writer did a very good job with the teen verbology... as a teen YA author myself I have to say serious kudos to her for that. MY fave line Shauna--if you're out there--was, ""You're like a new and undiscovered species of dork."" --Perfect timing!

The actors were cute, funny and fit their parts to a T. They did a great job casting this movie. And even going on a limb using a real band, The Click Five.  The band did good!  Absolutely perfect for what they were meant to do--and super cute--my daughter was blushing and squealing and giggling--and well, all the things you're supposed to do when you're imagining living out every girl's fantasy and getting to know your favorite star.

Also, when my older ones watched it today, my curious hubby came in after hearing us laugh near the beginning (Yes, I had to watch it again) he stayed standing, ready to leave at any moment, and then never left the room! Instead, he stayed in the corner laughing and chuckling along with the rest of us.

So if you're up for a great slapstick comedy type laugh.  And if you have teen daughters that love super uber cute rockstars who play great music and show loveable sweet personalities, I suggest you buy this movie. They're gonna want to own it. Great gift!",1226102400,8,2207,4.354523227383863

3497651,3,B001BPJJ96,"Taking 5(2008) is a fun comedy starring Alona Tal and Daniella Monet. Two unpopular high school girls are treated poorly by their favorite boy band. They get even by kidnapping the boy band members and forcing them to perform at their high school!
For some reason, this film was hyped as the ""next High School Musical"". The film has some pop songs and dance numbers, but it's not as larger than life as that Disney TV movie. Taking 5 has a couple of curse words. This may explain the PG rating. For a low budget movie, this film is photogenic, colorful, and attractive. Alona Tal is from Israel. She was in the army before she found work in movies and TV. Daniella Monet is cute, sensual, and bubbly. She is already a TV and movie star.
The producers of the film cast The Click 5 as the boy band in the movie. I found a You Tube video where Daniella Monet and one of her Taking 5 co-stars show us a work out program that you can do ""On the Cheap"". Taking 5 is a fun, breezy movie that you can enjoy with junk food and soft drinks.",1363219200,,1030,4.207070707070707
