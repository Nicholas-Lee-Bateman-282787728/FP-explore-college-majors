5841320,5,B00DPH7SO6,"Despite this release being called the third season, this particular collection is a prequel, thus taking place before the other seasons and the OVA collection. This season introduces all the characters of the Shinsengumi, and certain events make a lot more sense after watching the prequel, such as certain character's backstories. The season takes place before the Shinsengumi is even formed, and it primarily focuses on a young man named Ibuki Ryunosuke and his not so nice master, Serizawa Kamo. Serizawa saves Ryunosuke, but is then forced into servitude for a cruel and merciless master. However, Serizawa may have his reasons and may just be a misunderstood character or he may be a total jerk; its up to the viewer to decide.

This series is based off a video game dating simulation series for girls. This season does not give that vibe to viewer as much as the other two seasons because the main character is male, and thus the anime creators did not try to set him up with other characters on a date or something. However, in the other seasons, the main character is a girl surrounded by a bunch of very attractive men, and there were definitely scenes where she felt like she was getting set up for a certain character at times. It is true that this season has less big fight scenes like the other two seasons, but this season sets the groundwork for the rest of the series, despite this being the last season to be produced.

As with the rest of the series, it is based on historical events. The members of the Shinsengumi and Serizawa were real people. However, there is a supernatural element to the show as well, which is explained thoroughly in this season. If you start with the first season (like I did) the characters explain the supernatural element rather quickly as if the viewer should already know what is going on despite it being the first season produced.

This season and the others are licensed by Sentai Filmworks. There are no real special features on any of the releases. It would of been nice if there was some sort of historical notes section included on the discs for those that are interested in the characters and the timeline, like with Le Chevalier D'eon, which did include information about France and the people in that anime. Overall, the anime looks fantastic, and the story is engaging. There is some violence in the anime, but its nothing overwhelming like in Blood C or Gantz.",1390694400,6,2421,4.705188679245283
5841321,5,B00DPH7SO6,"I love this show. Season 3 is my favorite. If you like sword fights and historical animes this is for you. The characters are great, they each have their own background. You got to get it.",1385683200,,188,4.25
5841322,3,B00DPH7SO6,"Not as interesting as the first two seasons but still a good story none the less. I'm slightly biased since this isn't my typical genre but  it was still worth the watch and I was able to connect with some of the characters. If you haven't watch the 1st two seasons, watch those first as they are more engaging.",1385078400,,311,4.271186440677966

5841324,5,B00DPH7SO6,"I so love this prequel. After watching Season One, I was hooked. The Shinsengumi are so amazing, but I hate that annoying little girl who does nothing but get in trouble and shout out people's names. I purchased the second season and wished I hadn't because it really honed in on the relationship with Chizuru and that cranky, sour guy she is in love with, Toshi. I was very reluctant to buy Season Three, but I am so glad I did. It predates Chizuru, so it's all Shinsengumi. She is replaced by Ibuki--an equally incompetent young man that the Shinsengumi take in. He is less annoying because he actually has personality and back bone. It's really a wonderful prequel, showing the origins of the Shunsengumi and the relationships between the Samurai. It beat the pants off of Seasons One and Two.",1383436800,,796,4.652482269503546
5841325,5,B00DPH7SO6,"Season 3 is a prequel to Hakuoki. The main character does not appear in the previous seasons. Offers some interesting background stories on most of the character. The animation is nice, the dub is good, though I think that the Japanese voice cast is better. I really enjoyed this franchise. This season does not require watching previous season and stands on its own",1383177600,5,366,4.825396825396825
