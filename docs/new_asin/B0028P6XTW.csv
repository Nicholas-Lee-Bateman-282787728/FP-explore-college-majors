8356574,3,B0028P6XTW,"I wanted to write a review for this since no one has yet,i purchased this cause im a WW2 nut,i love history big time specially the German side during the war, like someone said ""if the Nazis hadn't existed you couldn't make them up!!  anyhow i received this video all the way from Germany, it comprises two discs, one has pictures (some Ive never seen before) and also video of the Wolfschanze and the airfield at Rastenburg and some train yard, these videos leave much to be desired, first off the were filmed in 1995!! granted when you talk about ruins they don't change much over the years but still they could have updated it some,second, the videos are silent,they could have a narrator telling you what was what, also, you cant pause the videos for some reason, i though that was strange, that comprises one disc, the other disc has a documentary of the wolfschanze in general and what happened there and when it was built etc, that documentary to me saved the whole purchase from being a 1 star deal, the whole thing is not super bad but it could have been much better!! wish i had better news, once i saw the cover i was excited and bought it on a whim,im a little disappointed now, shipping was very fast though!!",1444608000,,1222,4.455357142857143
