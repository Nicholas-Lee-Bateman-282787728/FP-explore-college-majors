7758979,5,B01G91G1QA,"Great story with triumph over adversity, a great picture of Americana at its best!",1471824000,,82,4.928571428571429
7758980,5,B01G91G1QA,"Boys of '36 bring into focus what the Olympics used to be about; Team effort and overcoming adversity. This is not the 5 minute clip we are used to prior to an event. This documentary only skips the surface of the lives children of the Depression lived and brought with them as they rowed for the gold. Don't forget to read the book that this American Experience was based upon: ""Boys in the Boat.""  The insight into the rowers lives( being on you own in a logging camp at the age of 8 with no one but yourself to depend on) adds to the essence of survival and inner strength. The Nazi crew team had no chance with the solid determination of the American boys from the northwest  in the race.",1470528000,5,692,4.2748091603053435
7758981,5,B01G91G1QA,Very inspiring story. Well presented. Highly recommended.,1470182400,,57,7.285714285714286
7758982,4,B01G91G1QA,"The book ""Boys in the boat"" was much better, but this captured some of the important moments.",1518825600,,93,4.529411764705882
7758983,5,B01G91G1QA,I love the book and it is so special to see them and the events filmed. I grew up in Seattle very near where the crew practiced and my Dad loved the crew races and took us to watch.  When I was older my friends and I would rent canoes and paddle around the Arboretum where they did then and so it was wonderful to read about things that happened in my neighborhood.  The boys had a lot of character that is worth remembering now.,1517184000,,429,4.035294117647059

7758985,3,B01G91G1QA,"The short on YouTube, The Background of the Boys in the Boat narrated by John Biglow is far better because he identifies of all the boys.  The director of The Boys of '36 emphasizes the importance of the trusting teamwork among ""the boys,"" yet identifies only the two coaches, the coxswain, and two rowers, which not only leaves us wondering who the other boys were, but also, destroys her point: what team?  Read the delightful book, The Boys in the Boat by Daniel James Brown, for the full story, and hope Kenneth Branagh gets the ""real"" movie made at some point in the not-too-distant future.",1512518400,,595,4.6571428571428575
7758986,5,B01G91G1QA,"So many films take liberties with the actual facts, so I'm therefore often disappointed with a film depiction.  Since The Boys of '36 was a documentary, this was not a factor, and the photos/footage provided greatly enhanced the scenes that I could only imagine as I read The Boys in the Boat.  The narrative provided by the documentary were important selections from a wonderful book.  Definitely read the book, and then you will enjoy The Boys of '36 even more!",1510185600,,463,4.7625

7758991,5,B01G91G1QA,"I had read the book about this subject so was familiar with the actual events.  I enjoyed it with my grandson and son.  They live in Japan and my grandson, though only 15 rows a canoe for his high school.  It is a difficult sport and I thought he and my son would be interested in this story, which they were.  I think it was difficult to document because of the two fold events.  Thank you for all that went into making it.",1504310400,,424,4.0602409638554215

7759001,5,B01G91G1QA,My only concern with this film is if people watch it without reading the book.  It is amazing footage to compliment the book but lacks so much of the detail that makes you appreciate what these boys went through to make them the rowers and the men they became.,1500508800,,260,4.3061224489795915
7759002,5,B01G91G1QA,"This is a good supplement to the book, I would highly recommend reading the book, ""The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics"" by Daniel James Brown, first. It was interesting to see footage of the ""Boys"" from regattas and the Olympics.",1499644800,,288,4.5576923076923075

7759007,5,B01G91G1QA,This video is a good supplement to the book.  The archival film and photos from the era tell a great story.  Worth watching on your PBS station or on Amazon Prime.,1494979200,,163,4.225806451612903

7759014,2,B01G91G1QA,"I read the book, BOYS IN THE BOAT, prior to viewing the video.  The reading was a far more rich experience of the events and characters.  There is just too little time here to do justice to the story of these courageous young men and the circumstances surrounding their victory.  It was nice seeing a bit of the video footage, but I strongly recommend this only as a very brief complement to the book.",1488672000,4,401,4.391891891891892

7759018,5,B01G91G1QA,It arrived in good timing. We have watched it and it is a fine DVD. Thank you!,1486512000,,78,3.6470588235294117

7759029,5,B01G91G1QA,"Although I generally am disappointed by non-fiction novels which are turned into video documentaries, this one had done an AMAZING job! Offering more visuals than the novel ""The Boys in the Boat"", it allowed the eyes to feast on a tremendous amount of archival footage taken in b/w and other amazing still shots provided by the lead characters (Joe Rantz, Bobby Moch, Stub McMillian, etc.) family members still living today.
The novel did offer a bit more of an in depth look into characters' fabric, but there was very little left behind. If you're into stories about underdogs and about beating the odds in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games , then this is DEFINITELY worth 53 minutes to lift your spirits.",1483574400,4,703,4.818181818181818
7759030,5,B01G91G1QA,Very good documentary on this event in history.  Doesn't have as many details as the Boys in the Boat book - but that's to be expected.  But this adds interviews with family members.,1483401600,,182,4.484848484848484

7759041,4,B01G91G1QA,"I enjoyed the show very much.  It was a good summary of the book ""Boys in the Boat"".  It included some excellent old news footage from the 1930s.  The program would have been even better if they had provided a brief epilogue of what happened later in life to each of the University Washington rowers and Al Ulbrickson, the longtime coach.",1479686400,,338,4.508196721311475

7759043,5,B01G91G1QA,"The PBS productions entitled American Experience are generally exceptional and this one is also. It could have been more lengthy and in more depth with regard to all of the rowers and their mentors, however, within the time frame allowed, it was very well done. This is an emotional story about hardship, overcoming circumstances and the power of human nature to persevere in the face of obstacles. And it stokes the feelings of pride for the accomplishments of United States athletes, especially in the 1936 Berlin Olympics.",1479168000,,525,5.045977011494253

7759046,5,B01G91G1QA,"I saw this on PBS last summer and knew it was going to be on. The featured person in this video, Joe Rantz, was my father in law, my son's grandfather. So this is a part of our family history and I am giving it as Christmas gifts to them! This was very well done, information taken mostly from the book Boys in the Boat by Daniel Brown, who interviewed Joseph Rantz before he wrote it. So instead of saving it on our DVR's forever we can have the DVD.",1477612800,20,451,4.022222222222222

7759050,5,B01G91G1QA,"Very good DVD.  I had enjoyed the audio book the ""Boys in the Boat"" which I would also highly recommend. I knew little about rowing, and some about the 1936 Olympics and found it all. very interesting.  However, what was most outstanding is its portrayal of these tough young men who challenged the elite and won for themselves and the American Dream.",1477008000,,351,4.645161290322581
7759051,5,B01G91G1QA,I loved this story. These guys were amazing. They overcame great obstacles of the time (The Great Depression) to attend college and row for the U of Washington and go on to win the 1936 Olympics. I have started a 3-4 times per week rowing workout on a concept II and have lost 10 lbs. I am wore out after 30 minutes...these guys rowed for hours!!! A great way to exercise and a very inspirational story.,1476662400,,403,4.315789473684211

7759057,5,B01G91G1QA,"An screen adaptation of the book, ""The Boys in the Boat"", this is the uplifting and inspiring story of the University of Washington eight man crew that competed and won rowing gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.  Great background on several of the individuals in the crew and an intriguing recounting of how this particular U. of Washington team came to represent the United States.  More than anything, the story reveals how this group of young men became and understood themselves to be a ""team"" and how absolutely critical dedication of one's self to the team is at this level of competition.  Should be required reading/viewing for anyone participating in a team sport.",1474848000,,671,4.920353982300885

7759062,5,B01G91G1QA,My son just started rowing and this movie had been recommended by my non-rowing brother.  What a fascinating story of hardship and triumph!  We were all riveted to the screen and loved the actual footage as well as the way it was presented.  It is so easy to forget how hard life was in the depression era and yet these boys overcame it.  We are so spoiled now that we would complain about everything and make demands.  These guys endured and prevailed through sheer willpower and survival instincts.  Great story for anyone....rower or not.,1473724800,6,541,4.702127659574468
7759063,4,B01G91G1QA,Read the recent book before viewing this AE episode. AE did a good job capturing the development of the team and the climactic Berlin games. the only thing missing was audio. I wish I could have heard some of the principals speaking about their experiences. They gave interviews. Does none of that material survive?,1473724800,,315,4.851851851851852
7759064,2,B01G91G1QA,Disappointing compared to the book.  I am used to more from PBS or American Experience productions.  They used the same photos repeatedly and did not fully develop the background of the rowers.,1473465600,,193,5.0

7759067,4,B01G91G1QA,A well done documentary except it left out too much of the story. It could easily have been 2 hours long and included more about George Pocock and Joe Rantz's father.,1473206400,,166,4.387096774193548
7759068,5,B01G91G1QA,"For those of you who haven't had a chance to read ""Boys In The Boat,"" this documentary will truly pique your interest to do so.  The footage of Seattle during the Depression is heart-rending, but like the book, the film underscores the hardship endured by each member of the crew, just to be accepted as one of the nine Olympians. Their stories along with a fascinating historical take on how rowing captivated America (East to West) and particularly the rivalry between the Washington and California crews (to say nothing of Hitler's Olympics) provided the non-crew enthusiast with enough background and heroics to create a convert.  I loved the book because of the wealth of detail and the ""swing"" of the story, but this documentary is nearly as exciting and comes in a close second.",1473120000,3,785,4.850746268656716
