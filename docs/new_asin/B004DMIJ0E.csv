4333112,5,B004DMIJ0E,"As the world watches mass movements turn long-established structures upside down, we all should be watching the vast sea of families across China that are torn by that great nation's 20th century history, followed by razor-edged economic realities today. ""Last Train Home"" was shot over several years of painstaking filmmaking by Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Lixin Fan, who earlier worked on the superb ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-the-Yangtze-Subtitled/dp/B001CCY42U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up the Yangtze (Subtitled)</a>."" The film captures major turning points in the lives of a teen-aged girl and her Mom and Dad, a couple making a deal with the economic devil in China to sacrifice their lives in sweatshops to build a brighter future for their children.

Those turning points cluster around the major New Year's festival in China, each year, when 130 million migrants jam rail lines and boats to gather in their family homes. The film's introduction points out that this may now represent the world's greatest annual migration. And, in the first year, we do see the family's modest New Year's feast and fireworks.

Roger Ebert, in his review highly recommending this film, made the point that this story might have been penned by Charles Dickens in the 19th century. That's an apt comparison as we watch lives ground up in sweatshops and children virtually orphaned into a world of predatory forces. I won't spoil the film by detailing too much of what unfolds in their lives, but the major eruption involves the teen-age daughter who supposedly was the bright hope for the family's future. The daughter is pictured on the cover of the DVD, wistfully looking out the window of a train.

There's a scene late in the film when teen-aged laborers at a bar and grill are allowed to stop for a moment to watch the opening of the 2008 Olympics on a big-screen TV. You'll never forget the juxtaposition of these young faces, caught in the midst of their labor, listening to an Olympics narrator crow: ""Friends from around the world will marvel at the splendid heritage and the richness of Chinese culture.""

Ebert and I are not alone on this. When it was briefly in theatrical release in 2010, the film also received strong recommendations coast to coast, including the New York Times. Want to understand a bit more about China? See this film!",1298332800,26,2388,5.194805194805195
4333113,4,B004DMIJ0E,"The Last Train Home is a 2009 documentary directed by Lixin Fan and produced by Daniel Cross and Mila Aung-Thwin of EyeSteelFilm. (Note: the literal translation of the Chinese title is ""Homeward Train"", a more accurate description in my opinion). It documents one migrant worker family - the Zhangs - but it presents the dilemmas faced by some 130 million migrant workers in current day China.

The core of the Zhang's dilemma is that Changhua and his wife, Suqin, have migrated from their rural village to work in garment industry jobs available in the city, leaving their two children behind in the care of the children's grandmother, Tingsui. The Zhangs only see their children once a year, when they and millions of other migrant workers make their annual trek home to rural villages all over China for the traditional Chinese New Year celebration.

In the Zhangs case, they have been doing this for sixteen years, ever since their two children, Qin (daughter) and Yang (son) were infants, all in the hope of providing a better life and future for their children. But it is not without a considerable toll. In addition to the long hours of labor, the tiny cramped quarters the Zhangs must live in to save money, the complete lack of anything like sick leave or other benefits we take for granted, there is the problem that they've become strangers to their own children, who to their dismay they discover not only do not understand why they have chosen the life they have, are, in the case of their 16-year-old daughter Qin, rejecting the future they have worked so hard for so long to give them. For it is revealed that Qin has not only dropped out of school, she has become a migrant worker herself because she is tired of living in a rural village and wants to go to the city where life is exciting and she can ""have some fun"".

Each of the family members has their own form of moving eloquence. The subtitles render the meaning of the Chinese words, but it is their faces and body language that convey the deep felt emotions that make their lives and problems universal. The father, Changhua, is a man who tends to silences, unable most of the time to confront his situation with words, letting his intuitive wife, Suqin, speak both to and for him; a moving display of two people truly bound together. The scene near the end of the film where they make the difficult decision for Suqin to stay in the village with their remaining child Yang while Changhua continues to labor in the city leaves you feeling the entire weight of the lives bearing down on them. The grandmother, Tingsui, is also moving as she comments on what is happening to the family with a mix of understanding and resignation that comes from having lived through three generations of change. And Qin, in her increasingly rebellious and frustrated outburts, leaves you sympathizing with her even while knowing that she is making a ghastly mistake that not only hurts her family but in the end hurts herself by denying her everything her parents had hoped for her.

Highly recommended as a starkly beautiful if troubling slice of life documentary, for anyone with an interest in the social conditions of modern China in transition.",1289433600,22,3206,4.7196428571428575

4333210,4,B004DMIJ0E,"Last Train Home directed by Lixin Fan, DVD, 87 minutes,  2009.

There are a million stories in the Naked City, and this is just one, introduced a famous television series from a half century ago. That was fiction; this is true documentary describing the plight of a rapidly modernizing China where today (2015) over 200 million countryside families are split up.  Many of Chinas rural parents seek a better life in the factories, sending back most of the money they earn to the grandparents raising their children. The pathos this causes to families and society at large is well-depicted in this matter-of-fact documentary spanning three years in the life of a rural family from Sichuan Province who work most of the year in the factories of southern Guangdong Province.  It is at the annual Spring Festival time that all Asian families get together, settle debts, honor elders, and celebrate family. At this time, the transportation infrastructure of China is stressed to the limit. I avoid traveling in China at this time, and the views of the massive crush in this documentary will reinforce why only the Chinese can manage this massive migration.

The story begins in the Winter of 2006 with the parents working in a sweatshop factory and attempting to buy train tickets. Only children and the elderly are left back on the village in Sichuan, 2 days travel by train to the north and west, or a week by bus. Finally they secure 2 tickets for 262 yuan or about $45. From the train, they depart on a ferryboat and finally by bus.  The mother relates leaving to work 16 years earlier, leaving her baby behind, and these once-a-year trips are their only connection with their children. The short homecoming time stresses the real Chinese parent preoccupation with pressuring children to study, study, study to have a better future. It is obvious that the children are estranged from their parents. The older girl, at an age that would indicate she would be about a junior in high school decides to herself begin working in Xintang City in Guangzhou, much to her parent's dismay. She has but one girlfriend as she works in the factory. Her father visits the daughter to convince/pressure her to return to school, and they again make the train trip back home. A snowstorm has shut down the electricity in Hunan Province and since the trains run on electricity, this causes a massive train station crowd requiring police and PLA crowd control. After passing through the turmoil at the station, they encounter many riders gripes and stories on the long ride home. At Chongqing, they switch again to ferryboat and arrive home where family arguments continue. The girl provides a prayer in the field to her grandfather who she feels was the only one to care about her, and leaves to work in a nightclub in modern Shenzhen. The 2008 Olympics in China rivet everyones attention but is immediately followed by a world recession that shuts down many factories. In the final scenes, the mother buys a train ticket and leaves her husband at the station in order to return home to be in the countryside to care for her son and keep him in school, so he does not follow his older sister.

Since this was filmed, even more rural couples have abandoned the countryside. Some bring their children to the cities where they study in second-rate immigrant schools with poorer-trained teachers. And recent policies have pressured some immigrant schools to close and some immigrants to return home.  There is much about Chinese language and customs that a Western viewer may miss. But the Chinese respect, indeed reverence, for education is apparent. So is their love for their children and yet, that word is never spoken. The extensive railroad network, bridges and tunnels, are impressive if a viewer looks beyond the melodrama. But even with the scale of the genuine train station scenes, it is hard for a Westerner to comprehend that this separation of families is a dilemma that is being repeated over 200 million times in China!",1419033600,7,4011,4.8452554744525544

I have personally experienced the overwhelmingly crowded and frustrating conditions that millions and millions of Chinese citizens have to deal with as they attempt to make their annual journey, with their extended families, back to their home villages.  I have fought through those crowds in an attempt to purchase almost non-existent train, bus, over-night sleeper buses, etc. to get 'home' and back after the holidays.  We here in the States have no concept of what about 80% of the Chinese people face just to return home and/or see their parents, grandparents, and even more heart-breaking - their children whom they leave behind, or in dorms somewhere so they can migrate to the teeming coastal cities in order to earn a few yuan each day.  Parents generally see their children only two or three times a year.  The children are cared for by their grandparents who are dependent on their children as their is almost no 'social net' under the socialist state.  I lived there on the 'local economy' - did not have the resources to afford the luxury of a quick, non-crowded flight.  Besides, air travel is mainly between major cities.  Once out of the airport you are back into the crowds.  And, tickets are not readily available at ticket booths but only through ""guan xi"" (back door/friends).  This film very accurately and with poignancy shows the emotional and physical obstacles faced by more than 1 billion Chinese citizens whenever there is a major holiday as most all travel at the same time - and haul unbelievable amounts of luggage with them as presents, supplies to the families they leave in the countryside.  The emotions expressed are real, poignant.  It takes me back instantly.  I can see it, smell it, hear it, feel it.

4333236,4,B004DMIJ0E,"The documentary Last Train Home tells the heart-wrenching story of a family caught in the turbulence of an industrializing China. Every Spring, for Chinese New Year, 130 million migrant workers trek back to their rural homes to rejoin their families, only to return again to their urban employment. The film was released in 2009 and now, four years later, the story is still relevant.

Zhang Changhua (father) and Chen Suqin (mother) have a teenage daughter (Qin) and a young son (Yang). The family is based in Sichuan province, but the father and mother left to Guangzhou to make money in a clothes factory 16 years ago, where they work all day on sewing machines. They're able to visit their children once a year during the Spring Festival holiday and make occasional phone calls. Their oldest child, Qin, is now a teenager.

Naturally, family relations are strained. Early in the film, Suqin, the mother, admits that when they're home with their children, they don't really know what to talk about. Qin, the daughter, is resentful of her parents for leaving them and wishes that they wouldn't visit at all. The children were raised by their elderly grandmother. They go to school and help on the farm. When the parents do return, their conversations revolve around exhortations to work hard in school, the importance of education, the need to excel in their grades.

The conflict in the film centers on Qin's relationship with her parents. Qin decides to drop out of school and pursue employment. She ends up in a similar job as her parents, working in a garment factory and running sewing machines. The  parents beg her to reconsider, but Qin prefers to make money rather than invest in her education. The three of them return back home together for the holiday and the water rises to a boil until finally Qin speaks her mind about her feelings toward her parents, which leads to a physical fight between Qin and her father. Qin leaves and returns to the city, but starts working at a bar as a waitress.

Last Train Home received piles of awards and for good reason. We truly get up close and personal with this family and a the same time we get a taste for the harsh realities that accompany industrialization. The most moving scenes, only second to watching these parents explain their hopes and dreams for their children, are watching the crowds waiting to get on trains. The sea of people wait up to a week outside the train station. Tickets get sold out, trains get delayed, and chaos is everywhere. Police and what look like military personnel try their best to keep the mobs calm.

When I watched this human ocean surge and try to overtop crowd barriers, I found myself (literally) shaking my head in disbelief. Just watching it made me frustrated at the inefficiencies. Imagine what the people must feel. Desperate people were crying, exhausted women collapsed when offered a chair. But there was no real enemy but the birth pangs of trying to grow the economy of the largest population on earth.

Changhua, the father, stood out most to me. While the mother was the chatterbox, the father was often silent, but was clearly not a passive figure in the family. In the midst of waiting for several days for the trains to arrive, the Changhua didn't crack. Maybe people get used to this after many annual pilgrimages home, but the camera captured many moments of outrage by other travelers. When the train arrived and the pushing and pulling began, Changhua made sure his wife and daughter made it onto the train, and spoke gently to make sure they boarded in a safe manner. For me, personally, the father was the hero of the film (as much as an issue documentary can have a hero).

The moral issues in the film are ambiguous at best. The parents left their children to make money to send home. Can money replace good parenting? Of course not. But in difficult situations such as this family faced, there's no good answer. Instead of making judgment calls, the right posture of the viewer should be to acknowledge the difficulties in urbanizing China, weep with those who weep, and celebrate the steadfastness of these parents to provide for their children.

4333241,4,B004DMIJ0E,"The documentary film, ""Last Train Home"" -- its subject concerning the millions of Chinese rural folk who venture out of their farm homes to work in urban factories -- is inserted with a booklet transcribing an interview with its director, where he asserts that his inspiration for making the film came from his personal knowledge of the suffering and misery endured by those countless Chinese born and bred in the farm areas of that huge nation. He also believes that the traumatic migration of migrant workers to the industrialized cities is a hardship that must be resolved in favor of urbanity: to make it easier to not only work in the city, but live there also.

The film however does not do a very good job in depicting the misery of the countryside; if anything; it shows the bucolic life in China as incredibly peaceful and easy-going amidst breath-taking magnificent mountains, fields and streams. It is in the city that we are confronted with images of mindless toil, grey working spaces, a nightlife of garish neon and noise, a relentlessly fast-paced way of life... and unhappy, miserable faces. But the justification for choosing the latter, endorsed even by the director, is the fervent belief that such promises real wealth, success, happiness, and freedom.

Well, you could have fooled me...

The city life not only is more visually uglier than the rural one but it actually sabotages the physical health of its adopters.

But though no peace of body or mind can be had the metropolitan way, it does give something in return... more money!

And gosh, look at what you can do with `more money'; you can buy cel phones, TV monitors, fast food, admission to overcrowded discothques that serve over-priced flamboyant alcoholic drinks, plus a good night's sleep in a hostel.

The Chinese seem to be falling for the same B.S. that has plagued our own society, in fact the societies of practically all Western industrialized nations for centuries... that money, and all the things that one can exchange for it, intrinsically defines ""a better way of life"". You might kill yourself trying to earn as much of it as you can; you can corrupt your morals, your body, your relations with others but in the end you can only be a `better' person for it.

Any agnostic, who questions the existence of a god, will find greater tolerance for his doubts than one who questions the relationship between money and `the better life,' even when evidence plainly contradicting that relationship is rubbed smack into one's face.

No, I have never visited either the farms or cities of China; my time of even reading of its history is practically zilch. You could rightly accuse me of being astoundingly nave and ignorant. But the dramatic assumptions that underscore the film should be made obvious, no?

But I am faithfully describing the images that this film presents. Combined with my reading of Western history and my personal experience with the American way of life, as it currently stands, has revealed to me that whatever the downsides are to rural living, its opposite has not proved that much of an advance.",1362787200,,3109,4.862003780718337

4333254,3,B004DMIJ0E,"Gui tu lie che (Lixin Fan, 2009)

China, home to over 1.3 billion people, is the world's most populous country, over four times the size of the United States (which ranks third on the list of countries by population as of December 2012; the country between the two, not surprisingly, is India). Ten  percent of its population--one hundred thirty million people--are migrant workers, folks who live in small, rural villages but work in the big cities, travelling home to visit their families--when it's possible--for holidays and vacations.

The central story of the documentary revolves around a handful of workers in Guangzhou who are preparing to go home for Chinese new year. Among them is a middle-aged couple, Changhua Zhang and Suqin Chen, who have been commuting to Guangzhou from Huilong, 1500 miles away, for sixteen years. The first time, they were leaving a newborn daughter with her grandparents. At the time the film was completed, that newborn daughter had become Qin Zhang, restive and rebellious teenager who, against the wishes of her parents, also begins the long-commute process; instead of following her paretns to Guangzhou, she goes to work in a garment factory in Beijing. This leads to some tension during the yearly trip home...

I liked this film, but not nearly as much as many other folks who have viewed it and commented. Much of my problem with it, irrationally, has to do with the limitations of documentary filmmaking. Real life does not answer questions as handily as do filmed fictions. And yet I found myself thinking over and over again, when mulling this movie and the resultant review, about the Korean film Treeless Mountain, made the year before, which touched (albeit tangentially) on the same subject in a much different way and seemed more satisfying while still leaving the same basic questions unanswered. It's not an exact parallel, of course; much of the reason for the migrancy in China has to do with a country of 1.3 billion people and a finite amount of arable land, which leads to the ultimate fate (we assume) of Jin and Bin not really being a valid option for Qin and her younger brother (just stay in the village and become a farmer, wot?). But the parallel stuck there in my head, impossible to ignore, and the more I thought about the movie the more it loomed.

This could be entirely intentional on Fan's part, of course. Not that specific comparison but the ambiguity with which we're left at the end of the film. The complete lack of narration (one of the movie's strongest points) leads to the film not choosing ""sides"" in this conflict: were the parents right to leave their family for eleven months out of the year in order to provide them with a life relatively free of poverty? Was Qin right to quit school and go to work in a factory herself in order to try and sustain that lifestyle? And that's not an either/or question, it's possible both were right. Or neither. These things are all open to interpretation. That takes some guts.

Fan, in an interview with PBS in 2011, said that both Qin (now back in school, though still in Beijing) and Suqin (who has retired and now stays in Huilong full time) are no longer part of the migrant grind, though the family's rifts may still be too vast to heal. Yang, Qin's younger brother, is still in school as well. Perhaps this is not a typical Chinese migrant family? We're stuck with Heisenberg--it's entirely possible that, through the simple act of observation, Lixin Fan changed this family's destiny.

Worth a look, but not necessarily worth all the hype it's gotten. ** ",1355270400,3,3585,4.789644012944984

But one thing other reviews may not have mentioned is that Last Train Home could be a wonderful learning opportunity for parents watching it with their teenage children.

It's no secret that many of our children are privileged and sheltered. (Not just our children. Some parents, too.)

This film can lead to many valuable discussions with our teens: the bonds of family; how much parents sacrifice for family, and why; teenage inability to relate to their parents; the importance of education; how very hard many work so we can buy ""stuff"" cheap; income inequality; communism vs capitalism; global economic competition; differences in culture; common things - washing machines, inexpensive  transportation, medical care, pensions - we take for granted; the pervasive influence of Western pop music and fashion on the Orient; Mao's disastrous Cultural Revolution, just 40 years ago ... and on and on.

This results in the largest mass migration in the history of mankind... once each year!

The congestion at the train stations is mind boggling. I am a practical soul, so I tried to imagine the logistics for mobs that have to wait, standing room only, from two to five days just to purchase tickets! What did they do, wear Depends?

Many Chinese leave their infants and toddlers with grandparents while they go to the cities to earn a living. There is a direct result of this which is multiplied by the millions who do it: These children feel abandoned and have no emotional link with their parents, nor do they respect them.

I was struck by the murky look of this film when it finally dawned on me that China's air IS that murky! If their industrial pollution can be viewed from space, it must also obscure the sun.

I always thought Communism was a cradle-to-the-grave proposition, but no, if people become ill, they have to pony up the cash for medical treatment. And much of what they earn is either spent on their children's educations or must be saved for the worker's old age. Hmmm....

4333262,5,B004DMIJ0E,"Surfing the tv channels one night I ran across this documentary film. I did not know what it was about and in fact had never heard of it. Within a few minutes of watching I was mesmerized and could not stop watching it. The story begins with a Chinese couple who are in search of train tickets to travel back home to see the rest of their family for the holidays. Unfortunately it appears the officials in charge of train transportation have not planned or cannot provide for the ""world largest human migration"".  After days of waiting in lines and checking various ticket counters they finally buy two over priced tickets to get home.

  Next we see a multitude of people trying to get on the trains. Were the tickets oversold? After a struggle our couple is packed onto the train to start the long journey home. Bathed in sweat and nearly sleeping on top of each other, our director does and outstanding job of telling the story with pictures, and superb editing.

  When the couple arrives home to see their two children and the grandmother that raises them the family has a new years feast. The parents hope their children are doing well in school and that is about all they talk to them about. Repeating over and over to do well in school.

  As the parents return to their jobs the story progresses and we find the oldest daughter herself wants to go to the city and get a job, abandoning school.

4333270,5,B004DMIJ0E,"This is an extremely powerful movie that all people, especially those who are in corporate America, need to see.

When our nation was great, many years ago during World War II and the decades immediately following that conflict, Americans had values and knew what mattered. We made sure that the Japanese had constitutional rights to collective bargaining and academic freedom. We made sure that the Western Europeans likewise had similar rights and protections. In return for protecting workers and giving them political freedom, we offered these nations access to our markets and free trade. Everyone benefited.

However, beginning in the 1980s a new breed of leader, economic traitors, came to office. With the encouragement of corporate leaders and useful idiot politicians and pseudo-intellectual free-market ""scholars"" happy to tow the corporate ""free trade"" line, we extended free trade to the whole world, without a care as to whether social security, collective bargaining, and political freedom existed in these nations. The goal was simple: lower wages in the United States and Western Europe by enabling Corporations to outsource as many jobs as possible. The most important goal, besides the lowering of American wages, was the busting of American unions.

This video clearly shows what life is like for the Chinese worker, who makes an average wage of $1000 per year. They have no social security, no workplace protections, no political rights, no right to collective bargaining. They live in cots in the factories where they work, their children play around them while they work, the kids may or may not have access to an education, child labor is legal, they must save the vast majority of what they make as there is no social security or pension system. Furthermore, the country that they live in denies them political and academic freedom.

We had a chance to protect American workers and Chinese workers by demanding that access to American markets had certain prerequisites: i.e. collective bargaining rights, social security like pensions, and political freedoms. Instead, we listened to neo-con economic traitors and corporate bosses interested only in short term profits. As you watch this film, and see the destruction of the Chinese family play itself out on the screen, remember, it is your presidents' (especially Bill Clinton and George W. Bush) and your Corporate leaders' (especially Steve Jobs and others who insist on manufacturing in China) fault. We did this. The Chinese have every reason to hate us. We talk about ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" but when the rubber hits the road we can care less.

But hey, if you are an executive or major shareholder in an American corporation what could be better? Virtual slave labor, no unions, no workers rights, and incredibly low salaries. You can screw the American worker, and the Chinese worker, and make millions and millions of dollars in the process.

The next time you ponder the Bible verse: ""it is easier for the rich man to get through the eye of the needle than to enter the Kingdom of Heaven,"" just ponder this film, and look carefully at what our greed and shortsighted stupidity is putting the American middle class, and the rest of the world, through. We could have demanded more and better for them in exchange for access to our markets. Instead, we give them, this.

4333271,5,B004DMIJ0E,"Last Train Home, 2009, refers to ""the largest human migration.""  This is a shocking view of peasants working in the city, trying to get home, once a year  from their factory jobs in the city to their provinces.

China's  130 millions migrants are not crowding, pushing, stressing, waiting for a train to anyplace exciting, nor a sports occasion, nor something entertaining...... but to a simple place called home.

Home is where they left their children to be raised by grandparents, home is where they are allowed to go but once per year, the Chinese New Year.  Home is where they can only make phone calls to, but cannot intervene any other way to check on their children living without them.  And this is today, not 50 years ago, but today!

This makes me think.....wow, we get to come home every night to raise our children, but can you imagine coming home once a year for a short time?  These people took trains, boats, buses on their journey home, to see the children they do not really know anymore.  They stressed out trying to get a train ticket on a seriously overcrowded train, carrying their bags with them.

The saddest part -  The mother and father who worked in the factory have a son and  early teen daughter who has left school, the camera follows her to the streetlife, working in the nightclubs.  She is persuaded to come home with parents, and a physical fight ensues between father and daughter.  Daughter's issues are like any young child who felt abandoned by parents, anger, resentment and rebellion are typical.

Based on the name, I thought it would be a documentary on the struggles that the Chinese go through to travel back to their hometown during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday (think busy and crowded holiday travel but on a more frustrating scale), but this film is more than just that. It follows the life of one migrant family from 2006 to 2008. The parents come from a poor rural village in the countryside and have to leave their children behind as they migrate to a faraway city for work. The children are raised by grandma, hence the children are closer to their grandparents than they are to the parents. Out of the two children, the camera focuses more on the daughter who is the oldest child at 16-17 years old. Teenage girls go through a rebellious stage and this is what she is going through. She wants to be independent and not be controlled and nagged by parents who are like strangers to her, so she decides to drop out of school and migrate like her parents to the city for work and an independent life. She starts off as a factory worker doing seamstress work, then later changed work to a club as waitress. She is not a happy child; she hardly smiles throughout the documentary. Most of the documentary focuses on the parents, their factory work (they are seamstresses), their worries for their children, and then their struggle to get back to their hometown during the annual Chinese Lunar New Year mass holiday travel season. This makes the Chinese news every year because every year you see so many people crowding trains to get home for family reunion. Some people line up for weeks to get train tickets. The end of the documentary shows the parents making a tough and sad decision to separate. The mom will go back home to raise and be close to her young son before he strays off like the sister; and the dad will be the sole breadwinner of the household. One of many, sad but true, story of one migrant worker family in China. It makes me feel blessed to be living a better life.",1514160000,,2030,4.489189189189189

Love my culture. I  wanted to go and visit China, God help me,  now I understand why they need the Americans and Europeans to invest in factories.

8425692,4,B004DMIJ0E,"It's easy in the West to picture Mainland China rising in prosperity and comfort, but that's not the country you'll see in this documentary. The parents left their children in grandma's rural village hands to do factory work in a faraway city. The teen daughter resented their long term absence and didn't appreciate their sacrifice to earn money for her education. The Chinese family values of loyalty, sacrifice, and parental respect still rule the lives of the two elder generations, but have broken down in the youngest. The movie's best scene is the dense, desperate throng waiting for five days in the station for train service to be resumed after a snowstorm knocked out power. Parents get separated from children. Police try to maintain order. People are close to fainting. Where will they get food? How can they relieve themselves? (This wasn't covered in the movie, but I wondered.) Their grueling ordeal gave perspective to the times I've complained about rush hour traffic or a crowded airplane trip. There is no comparison. I give this documentary 4 stars for opening my eyes to the family stresses brought on by genuine hardship and sacrifice. A fifth star would have come with crisper editing to cover the personal lives of this family more deeply.",1506816000,,1263,4.962264150943396
