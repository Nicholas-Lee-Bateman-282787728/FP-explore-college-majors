I wa terribly disappointed to find out this was nothing more than a little lecture taped during a convention and the video's content gives the viewer a superficial nutshell version of the importance of the Akashic records. I gave this two stars because its description didn't say it would really give anyone a clue as to how to gain wisdom from the Akashic records. The description was as ambiguous as the information contained in the video. The speaker was likeable but she interrupted herself several times to try to find people in the room who needed to hear messages. This had nothing to do with ""Your Akashic Records for Empowerment."" I guess I need to really read the synopsis before watching a video to make sure that it's not little more than words strung together designed to promote itself.",1449705600,,840,4.760273972602739
