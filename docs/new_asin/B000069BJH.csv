1731259,4,B000069BJH,"OK, I only watched this film because it was shown on a recent transcontinental flight, and because I forgot my CD player, this seemed like the best option.  I dreaded something out of the pits of Nickelodeon marketing bin, but ended up laughing out loud many times and disturbing my sleeping planemates.
Impressive teen actor Frankie Muniz and veteran Paul Giamatti (who are both perfectly cast in their respective roles) lock horns in classic slapstick style.  Unlike the ""Home Alone"" movies, however, the continuous battle of pranks doesn't get old as the movie rolls along.  Giamatti shines as the classic evil Hollywood type, bringing back memories of his magnificent part as Pig Vomit in ""Howard Stern: Private Parts.""  I hate to typecast him, but he plays the role to a perfection.
Amanda Byrnes fills in nicely as the token female 'friend' of Muniz, giving the viewers a taste of gentle teen angst.

As family movies go ""BFL"" is one of the best there is and is thoroughly enjoyable (and appropriate) for all age groups. I think our family has seen it a dozen times and it is just as funny the twelfth time as it was the first. Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast as big-shot, self-absorbed film producer Marty Wolf aka ""The Wolf"" aka ""Wolfman"" and his performance, as usual, is superb. Muniz and Bynes also give very good performances and all of the supporting actors are terrific as well.

1731377,5,B000069BJH,"KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Willow Jones shares her review of this film:
I really like the mood of this story!
Big Fat Liar is about a boy named Jason Shepard (Frankie Muniz), who likes getting out of doing things like his homework when he doesn't feel like doing it by lying.  Most of the time when he lies he gets caught.  Now, Jason has only a few hours to write a thousand-word essay.  Jason finally gets it done, but is running late for school.  On his way Jason runs into Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), a Hollywood producer, and begs Marty to give him a ride to school.  Jason gets to school on time, but leaves his homework in the limo with Marty.  Marty reads the paper and likes it so much he decides to turn it into a movie and claim it was his idea.  Much like in the story of the boy who cried wolf, when Jason tells his parents and teacher the movie was from his essay, no one believes him.  Jason decides to travel to LA to find Marty and make him tell the truth.  Jason asks his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) to come along and help him.
Technically, the film was good overall, but the sound was weak and should have been louder.  The acting was quite good.  I enjoyed Paul Giamatti's character a lot because he really brought out the humor.
I think the story is interesting.  My eyes were glued to the screen waiting to see what would happen next.  I liked that it played with the story of the Boy Who Cried Wolf even naming the villain, Marty Wolf.  The moral of the story was really good, telling the truth is not overrated.
I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and feel anyone will enjoy this movie, but kids over 5 may understand it better than littler kids.",1343952000,,1667,4.217665615141956
1731378,4,B000069BJH,"Marty Wolf is a self-centered and abrasive movie producer who uses an idea from a 14 year old's theme paper for a blockbuster sensation to be released the following summer. Muniz plays the 14 year old who wrote the paper but is notorious for not telling the truth. When he tries to explain that the upcoming blockbuster called Big Fat Liar is based on his homework, no one believes him. He and his friend, Amanda Bynes, who covers for his untruths on occasion, fly to Hollywood to set the matter straight. Marty Wolf turns out to be quite a liar himself and won't cooperate in returning the homework or calling the youth's parents to tell them the truth. The two teenagers recalibrate Marty's world with humorous pranks. Roses may be red, but sweet revenge is blue with red hair.",1343606400,,779,4.611510791366906
1731379,5,B000069BJH,This is probably the funniest movie my daughter had growing up. Really fun and it does teach kids a great lesson about what happens if you tell lies.,1311552000,,149,4.357142857142857
1731380,3,B000069BJH,"Big Fat Liar stars Malcolm In the Middle star Frankie Muniz and his girlfriend going on an adventure to Los Angeles.

It's about Frankie's character with a major lying problem.  He lies to his teachers, he lies to his parents, he lies to *everybody* it seems.

One day after writing a short story for a school assignment, he gets mixed up with a movie producer in a limousine incident and forgets to take his story with him after leaving the car.  Well, being the crooked thief that the movie producer is portrayed as,  he picks it up, steals Frankie's idea, and eventually makes a movie out of it.

When Frankie's character goes to a movie theater and sees his ideas being utilized on the big screen, he tries to explain to everyone that his story was stolen, but guess what?  Yup, you guessed it- NOBODY believes him!  From here the storyline kicks in.

It's about Frankie getting his revenge on the guy who stole his short story by constantly humiliating and torturing him.  Unfortunately for us (the viewers) many of the practical jokes aren't that funny.  At least, I feel they could have been better.  The only time I was really impressed is when blue ink was dumped in the swimming pool and turning the man blue from head to toe.  The rest of the jokes fell completely flat.

I really hated the one where Frankie's character forced the crooked movie producer to jump out of a helicopter, and the one involving his car getting smashed was pretty terrible as well.  Just a lot of missed opportunities for humor.

Overall, well the kids probably won't mind the many humorless segments, but us adults will notice them immediately.  Other than that, it tells a decent story about what happens to those who steal and lie (obviously the message being ""what goes around comes around"") but other than that, it's not that great.",1300924800,,1825,4.635514018691588

1731383,5,B000069BJH,"As far as kids movies are concerned, there are few better than this one.  I'm not usually one to gush over these kinds of movies, but this one keeps me entertained (sure, in a cheesy kind of way) each and every time I watch it.  Each gag, each joke, each scene is just fun and exciting.

Yeah, I like this one; a lot.

The films premise is pretty cool too.  Jason is a young kid of fourteen who has an issue with lying (what kid doesn't), and his bad behavior has landed him in some trouble.  Jason is the definition of the `boy who cried wolf', and so when he actually tells the truth (that his essay was stolen by a movie mogul who is now plagiarizing by turning his story into a major motion picture) no one believes him; except his best friend Kaylee (but she may not even `really' believe him).  When opportunity arises (as it often does in these films), Jason and Kaylee make their way to Hollywood in order to expose this creep and earn the trust of Jason's parents.

The whole idea of young kids using their imaginations to create something excites me, because I was once that kid, dreaming of writing something so amazing it became a movie!

The acting here is very good for a film in this genre, and character actor Paul Giamatti is at the top of the pack.  I mean, when is he NOT good (don't answer that...I did see `Lady in the Water', but he was far from the worst part of that mess)?  I admit to never having ever seen an episode of `Malcolm in the Middle', but I've seen a few of Frankie Muniz's movies and I really think that for a child actor he is quite good (can you believe he's not a child anymore?).  Amanda Bynes is a gimmick, but she's so incredibly enjoyable (I've said this before) and I heart her so I have nothing but praise for her here as well.

What makes the film pop though is the smart writing.  This has been done before (you know, smart kids + stupid adults = war) but this feels new and fresh to me.  Each gag feels surprising and what is cool about this is that it manages to impress with each viewing.  I've seen this a few times and every time I see it I laugh and enjoy myself.

Thanks in HUGE part to the phenomenal performance of Paul Giamatti, BFL takes a unique idea, some excellent cameo casting (you gotta love Jaleel White with the self-effacing work he does here), and the fairly restrained performance of Frankie Muniz and concocts a funny and well done albeit innocuous little cinematic treat. Muniz could've gone overboard which other young actors succumb to but he stays in check for the most part and allows the rest of cast to do what they do. Again, without Giamatti, this movie is a throw-away, but his performance is delicious and never fails to make me laugh no matter how many times I hear his caustic remarks. He is just so, so good here!

The key point of this movie is that lying is bad.  Good point.  A device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks.  Also good.  Unfortunately, the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible (even kids will have a hard time believing a man can't tell he's been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror), and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion, the entire thing falls flat.

Making films for children is a fine thing.  They shouldn't be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children, however.  Quite honestly, I'd rather have a kid watch something like ""Good Will Hunting"" before this.

1731403,4,B000069BJH,"Frankie Muniz stars as Jason Shepherd, an eighth grader who simply can't ever tell the truth.  The opening scene of the film finds him getting to school late (after lying to his parents two or three times) working his way into the classroom through the window (with the help of friend Amanda Bynes) and then lying to his teacher about the reason he does not have his assignment.  He spent all night at the hospital with his ailing father.  Daddy couldn't figure out how to chew a meatball.  He even has the teacher call a phone number to confirm it and lies his way through that as well.  (The phone number was his cell phone)
Naturally, the teacher meets his parents later that day and gives him one chance to re do the paper.  He does it, is on the way to deliver it, and hits the limo of movie producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti).  Wolf ends up with the story, makes a movie about it, and Jason now can't convince his parents that he wrote the story.
This movie works primarily because Muniz is charming on the screen.  It's essentially adults against kids, with Giamatti really taking a beating.  He spends a large amount of the film dyed blue from head to toe because of some pranks the two teens pull on him.  He has made some enemies of some adults as well, stepping on them while he has gotten to the top.  When they find out the kids are after him, they all want a piece.
I also liked Amanda Bynes.  This is the first thing I have seen her in and she does a great job.  She sticks by Jason and helps him whenever things look bleak.  Watch also for a cameo by Jaleel White, the former star ""Urkel"".  He's grown up and plays off his earlier success nicely.

Of course, as kids movie, Muniz's character Jason, 14-year-old Michigan boy, is a fibber, not ""a big fat liar"" (meaning not that bad boy), who makes up his own small story to explain why he didn't do his homework before his teacher Sandra Oh.  Ms. Oh is convinced at first, but the fib is discovered, and his parents don't like it, let alone being called by angry school teacher.
Then, the real Big Fat Liar appears as Hollywood producer Paul Giamatti, the best reason for adults to see this film.  This Hollywood player, who desperately needs a hit, unashamedly steals the idea of Jason thought of as an essay to submit to his teacher, and this guy even tries to make a movie out of HIS idea.  Now Jason's got to do something to stop that.
The film is always fast-paced, and because of the good healthy amount of visual gags and humor it is always interesting to see.  Some references to Hollywood names and the cameo of Lee Majors make the whole film lively.  And you also get a pretty funny John Woo parody.
But the driving force of the film is Paul Giamatti.  His dedicated performance as a bit megalomaniac producer is much better than a simple caricature.  Giamatti shows unexpected flairs for slapsticks too, and his swimming pool scene (which makes him really blue) is just hilarious.
Unlike Muniz and Giamatti, female characters seem relagated to thankless secondary roles.  Bynes is cute without being irritating, and you see equally cute Amanda Detmer as Giamatti's assistant, but they should have been given more chances to do something interesting.  I waited for them to do some funny thing, or deliver some good lines, but I didn't get them.
Maybe you realize that no Hollywood producers would live in a house with this minimum security system, where kids can go in and out so freely.  And you know, one of Giamatti's friends seems to be Adam Sandler.  But if Sandler is your pal, you don't have to worry about making a hit movie.

Jason decides to go across America with his best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) to set everything straight, and make his parents believe that he really did write that paper, and it was made into a huge movie.

It's payback time when Jason and Kaylee both do hilarious things to Marty to make him tell Jason's parents about stealing his essay.

MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE star Frankie Muniz plays Jason Shepard, a 14 year old perpetual liar who is caught out when fibbing about doing a school English assignment. He is given the ultimatum of writing the paper or being sent to summer school. So Frankie starts writing a fact-based story titled BIG FAT LIAR (clever). He completes the task and heads off to school to hand it in.
However while biking to school he is struck by a limo; whose passenger happens to be Marty Wolfe (Paul Giamatti) a famed Hollywood producer.
To make amends, Wolfe offers to give  Jason a ride to school... but on arriving Jason discovers he's left his assignment behind. Of course when Jason tells his teacher the story, she doesn't believe him and she calls a meeting with his parents. So to prove to his parents that this time he's really telling the truth Jason must try and get his paper back from Wolfe.
But Wolfe has other plans, like turning Jason's paper into a major film (which he steals all credit for). A pretty smart move for a guy currently making a movie starring Jaleel ""Urkel"" White as a cop with a chicken for a partner. Sure-fire blockbuster material.
So in order to get his script back Jason and his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) fly to L.A to try and let the truth be known. But Wolfe, nice guy that he is; sets fire to Jason's script. Is that the end? No. Because as even the most dimwitted Hollywood types know, you always make a back-up copy.
So Jason and Kaylee have no option left but to play dirty. With the help of downtrodden film industry employees who've been burned by Wolfe one time too many; they set out to teach him a lesson once and for all. Which means loads of clumsy slapstick humor, which will really appeal to the kids.
Adults will enjoy seeing the PSYCHO house and other setpieces from movie classics on display here. Some of it's funny, some of it's feeble, but you could do far worse.

Spawned by former ""Head of the Class"" regulars Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (both of whom have been involved in various Nickelodeon shows), what will follow for an adult watching is increasing degrees of drowsiness, until you've collapsed onto the floor in a stupor.  The kids will love it (the movie and watching you fall to the floor).
The plot: Pathological liar Jason Shepherd (Muniz) finds himself in a bind: it's the end of the school year, his grades are bad, and he needs to compose an essay in order to avoid summer school.  He rushes home, pens an essay called ""Big Fat Liar,"" and rushes back to school (on a girl's bike, ho-ho) to turn the essay in.  On his way to school he crashes into a limo.  The occupant is Marty Wolf, hotshot Hollywood producer, played with some glee by Paul Giamatti.  Wolf is your stereotypical Hollywood producer, who does a lot of yelling at people, whether in person or on the phone.  You see, Wolf is mean.  Shepherd convinces Wolf to give him a ride to school, which he does.  And now, the plot begins its descent into fantasy land.  Jason's essay was left behind in the limo, and Wolf ends up stealing it to create his next big movie.
And so it goes.  Jason and his girlfriend Kaylee (Bynes), while watching a movie, see a preview for the next Marty Wolf production: ""Big Fat Liar.""  What follows is a series of ever increasing inexplicable events, as the two teenagers somehow get their way from Michigan to LA without anyone being suspicious (Jason pays for the tickets with a big wad of cash.  Wouldn't a ticket agent be slightly suspicious?)
Once in LA, Jason confronts Wolf and asks him to tell his father that the essay was indeed written by Shepherd and that Wolf had stolen it.  Wolf refuses.  So it's up to Jason and Kaylee to get their revenge, which they do through a number of ""funny"" revenge bits.  Virtually every action they take against Wolf is illegal, but the movie ignores that so we can laugh (well, the kids will laugh) as Wolf is turned blue, has his expensive car crushed, etcetera, blah blah blah.  The teens enlist the help of what seems to be dozens of adults, all of whom had been victimized by Wolf, and in the end, the mean old Wolf has his life ruined and the young vandals/thieves get their reward.
At this point, you may have emerged from your state of semi-consciousness.  And that's when the kids will ask you to rent ""Pluto Nash.""",1057449600,,2655,4.530398322851153

With the possibilty of spending summer trapped in a hot sweaty classroom, Jason is prompted to write a short, but inspired original story called ""Big Fat Liar"", hence the title.  '

While furiously peddling his sisters bicycle to get to his teacher and hand in his essay, he runs the bike right into an unruffled and completely obnoxiously pompous movie mogul named Marty Wolf.  A brilliantly comical performance from Paul Giamatti.  Right away we can see Wolfs' true colors, which will be even brighter later.  He gives Jason a ride to his school, only to avoid a lawsuit, but when Jason leaves the car, he also leaves the essay, in the claws of the Big Bad Wolf!  Defeated, facing summer school, he goes to the movies with his girlfriend, only to find his story has been lifted word for word by Wolf, and is the theme and title for the upcoming summer box office blockbuster from Wolf studios in Hollywood.

When his parents don't believe his story, the only way he can convince them, is to travel to Hollywood with the assistance of his galpal, and force ""the Wolf"" to tell the truth.  Will Jason succeed?  Watch this hilariously entertaining adventure and find out how a fourteen year old boy can break down a successful grown man in the most hilarious, albeit implausible ways ever seen.

  It has been a daunting task to find a movie that the whole family can enjoy, but here it is.  With the preponderance of negativity in childrens movies, depressing topics, scary characters and themes, this film is a refreshingly fun and carefree experience that is truly entertaining for any age viewer.  No one dies, no one gets hurt, nothing to put bad ideas into a sensitive young mind.  This is the first film I have seen recently where no child has lost a parent, or suffered some tragic loss as part of the theme.  Even in the Rugrats, Chuckie's mom has died!  It is pathetic how ridiculously realistic they make situations in childrens features. Films for kids shouldn't leave them fearful and sad, yet I dumped several that did in the past year.  They are either depressing or too scary.  I FINALLY found a keeper!

So here is ""Big Fat Liar"", a film with fun and laughs all the way from start to finish.  You have a pair of kids to root for, and a FUN villain who you will love to hate.  You even get a grown up Urkel too! There is not one dull moment, the entire cast is terrific,  and the soundtrack pulls the mood together perfectly.  FINALLY, the perfect film for everyone at any age to watch, and enjoy over and over again.",1041811200,,3036,4.535911602209945

1731416,5,B000069BJH,This is a great movie featuring Frankie Muniz from Malcolm in the Middle and Amanda Bynes from Nickelodeon. Famous Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) steals his class paper and turns it into a hit film. Jason Shepherd (Muniz) has a reputation for telling the truth. This is quite different from any role Muniz has played before where he tends to be a bit Shy (for example My Dog Skip). But he plays this role well. No one believes Shepherd when he says this and he may fail his grade. But his freind Kaylee (Bynes) believes him and when both of their families are away they leave their small Michigan town for Hollywood and have quite an adventure.,1040947200,,659,4.593220338983051

This is a fantastic & clever movie, with an interesting plot. Only the fact that it would never happen in history & bad acting in about a 1-minute period (back at the base during phase 4. watch it to understand) dent this movie from being perfect..Get it today!",1040860800,,399,4.555555555555555
1731418,5,B000069BJH,"Ever heard the old saying stating, ""a film for all ages.""  Well, Big Fat Liar is one of very few films that has a serious shot at making everyone in the family laugh. I was a skeptic at first but I soon found myself laughing at a consistant rate - and I'm sometimes hard to please in the humor department.
We see two teens, one with a habitual liar, and their attempt to get back at a egocentric movie producer who's stolen a story from one of the teens. They set out to make the producer's life a mess and succeed in some very humerous and comical ways.
The plot is a bit simple, but the acting, humor, and deployment of humerous lines works at a fantastic rate. If you're a fan of clean, yet outrageous humor, this film will be right up your alley.
This film will work if you're trying to create some laughs at a large group function while still maintaining a clean atmosphere. Two thumbs up!
Enjoy.",1040428800,,901,4.269005847953216
1731419,5,B000069BJH,"Big Fat Liar, to me, sets an example by wich most other comedies should be based. The storyline follows 14 year old Jason Shepherd and his friend Kaylie through a fun filled journey to Universal Studios, where producer Marty Wolf is turning Jason's stolen story into a hit film.

The one minor drawback is that Frankie Muniz looks just like Malcolm, dresses just like him, and talks just like him.  So it's a little tricky to separate the actor from his most identifiable role.  If you have seen Miracle in Lane 2; you can see what I mean.",1040083200,,432,4.0588235294117645
1731421,1,B000069BJH,"This movie was absolutely horrible. Frankie Muniz acts great in Malcome in the Middle but this and the last piece of junk ""My Dog Skip"" he acted in takes the cake. Big Fat Liar Ha! Kid meets a older version of himself and has to compete against him for his life. That concept has been done already in previous movies and TV shows thank you. Throw in a couple of hasbeens nobodies an average stereotype friend, a few stunts that came off of ABC's 1 Saturday Morining cartoons and what do you get? A movie that makes people laugh? No indeed. Instead a grade F film that makes money for Hollywood. Amanda Bynes can act but she keeps throwing in horrible oneliners that sounds like it came from the Annoying Amanda Show. Frankie Muniz is a great actor but his part as Jason is worthy for the Golden Turkey Award!",1038960000,,808,4.3933333333333335
1731422,3,B000069BJH,"With  both teenagers and an 19 month old daughter I tend to watch the whole gambit of movies from Wiggles videos, Disney movies to serious drama.  This movie kind of falls into a middle zone that makes it one that I  won't be watching again any time soon.  It was way to silly for my teenagers to consider worth watching and the comedy and characters way above my little ones head.
That being said I felt it was definitely a good family movie (provided the audience is in the right age group, probably 7 to 11 give or take).
It had some scenes that I considered funny, watching as a somewhat critical adult that I am, but not nearly enough of the humor or gags were funny enough to make it a classic.  The main character was supposed to be a certain type of hero (say like a Ferris Bueller) but the movie just didn't have enough there to make him into a memorable figure.  That isn't to say the acting wasn't first rate, it because it was very good, but that the situations and story line just weren't up to it.
I certainly recommend this as a good clean fun family movie, but not necessarily as part of a family collection of movies to watch over and over.  It is probably just one to rent.",1038873600,2,1191,4.243362831858407
1731423,3,B000069BJH,"""Big Fat Liar"" offers a lively contemporary spin on the Boy Who Cried Wolf legend.  Jason Shepherd is a 14-year-old inveterate liar who spends most of his time devising elaborate yarns to keep himself out of trouble with his parents and teachers.  One day, through an amazing fluke, he meets up with a nefarious movie producer named Marty Wolf who steals Shepherd's story idea - a composition he wrote for his English class entitled ""Big Fat Liar"" - and proceeds to make a movie out of it.  When Jason's parents refuse to believe their son's outlandish tale, the youngster heads out to Hollywood to confront Wolf and make him verify his story.  When Wolf refuses to do this, Jason concocts an elaborate scheme to make Wolf's life a living hell until he relents and helps make things right back home.
Kids will love ""Big Fat Liar"" for the simple reason that it works as pure adolescent fantasy wish-fulfillment on several levels.  First, it shows a youngster getting the rare opportunity of turning a major studio backlot into his own personal playground (the film sometimes feels like a 90-minute commercial for Universal Studios' behind-the-scenes tour).  Second, it feeds the desire we all have to watch the tables being turned on a certified rascal.  And, third, like any good fantasy for children, it puts the kids in a position of power over the adult world.  Jason and his pretty cohort, Kaylee, get to call the shots and pull the strings that eventually get the grownups to pay attention and listen to them.
""Big Fat Liar"" might actually have been a better film had it resisted the tendency to overdo so much of its comedy.  In fact, the best parts of the film occur near the beginning when Jason and his adventures stay connected to the real world.  Once he gets to Hollywood, the film loses a bit of its edge.  The cleverness and wit of the film's opening stretches give way to overwrought plot mechanics and over-the-top slapstick.  The film has a great deal of undeniable energy, but subtlety can be a virtue as well and we miss that sense of sly fun that defines the film's ambiance early on.
Still, ""Big Fat Liar"" has more to recommend it than the average teen comedy.  First of all, it stars the marvelous Frankie Muniz (""Malcolm in the Middle"") who has energy and charm to spare in the role of Jason and who literally keeps the film bouncing along even when the comic setups don't always pay off as well as they should.  Muniz is one child actor I will miss when he grows too old to still play these parts.  Amanda Byrnes is equally likable as Jason's conspiratorial companion, Kaylee.  And even though Paul Giamatti seems to be doing a Jim Carrey impersonation through large sections of the film, this fine comic actor hits heights of magnificent manic madness as the put-upon, hissable villain of the piece.  The movie also has a fun time ribbing many of the elements of Hollywood culture - from the unemployed ""actors"" working as chauffeurs to the has-beens looking for that big career turnabout to the insipid material that often serves as the basis for big studio productions (a movie about a cop teamed up with a crime-fighting chicken is the example here).
""Big Fat Liar"" provides mixed blessings for the sophisticated adult audience, but youngsters should enjoy it all.",1038614400,,3292,4.7272727272727275
1731424,3,B000069BJH,"Frankie Muiz from FOX and Amanda Bynes from NICK and the WB will certainly be the main draw for kids to see this movie.  The storyline is simple.  Muniz tells lies, he gets in trouble and must turn in his paper entitled BIG FAT LIAR.  However, in his rush to deliver the paper to his teacher, he crashes into producer Narty Wolf's limo, played by Paul Giamatti.  Wolf reluctantly gives him a lift and the boy accidentally leaves his paper.  Wolf takes it and claims it for his own, deciding to make it into a movie.  The kids try to get a confession from Wolf but he refuses.  Efforts to force him to do so is where the movie really gets interesting.
It is an interesting film, better than I expected.  There is no hint of romantic tension between the kids, they are just friends.  Jason, played by Muniz, also learns a lesson against lying, particularly if he does not want to grow like the deceitful movie producer.
Toward the end of the film, Wolf gets attacked by a kid in a ""nut"" cracking move.  We are not shown the hit, but the intimation is clear that it is unfortunate pelvic humor.  It is unfortunate that such stale pitfalls are still considered funny.
The out takes are very revealing.  Evidently the chicken (who played an actor in another movie) was originally scripted as inadvertantly eatten by the producer-- no doubt another of the stunts orchestrated by the two youths to force a confession.  I suspect that it made the kids look too malicious, and it would certainly offend vegetarian members of PETA.  This scene comes as part of a seduction attempt upon a well-endowed woman in the producer's trailor.  It is interrupted, but he tries to get her to wear a skimpy bikini, under the guise of an audition for a beach movie.  I am glad that this sordid scene is deleted, but parents should be aware that it is presented under bonus material.
Excluding the deleted scenes:
>No nudity or sexual situations.
>Some mean language but nothing sordid.
>Comical plot violence but nothing gross.
It passes as family fare.",1038528000,,2030,4.597222222222222
1731425,5,B000069BJH,"Big Fat Liar is a movie that is highly recommended.  Universal has done an excellent job of bringing an amazing cast together to tell a really good story.  The movie is about Jason Shepherd (played by Frankie Muniz), who is a compulsive liar and happens to have his short story stolen by Hollywood producer Mary Wolf (played by Paul Giamatti).  As a result of the stolen story, Jason must attend summer school.  Jason soon sees that Marty is going to be making the story into a movie.  In a well conceived plan, Jason and his best friend Kaylee (played by Amanda Bynes) head out to Hollywood to confront Marty.  Jason only wanted a simple phone call to his father to show that he was telling the truth.  Marty doesn't agree to it and in turn has Jason escorted out by security.  A bit upset, Jason decides that payback is a must.  Over the course of a weekend Jason and Kaylee have it out with Marty by conducting various retaliations, including making him look like a Smurf.  (The other retaliations are also quite hilarious.)  Eventually Marty and Jason square off on the rooftop of a movie set and this is where everybody gets to see the kind of person Marty truly is.  The film ends on a high note where Jason gets his revenge...and a little bit more.  The film is one that anyone can enjoy, and with cameos by Lee Majors, Dustin Diamond and even Jaleel White, laughs are guaranteed.  Even the bonus features make this disc a treat.  There is a trivia challenge featuring other Universal films, deleted scenes which are pretty good, a behind the scenes feature, an ""Are You A Big Fat Liar"" quiz, and Amanda Bynes even gets to help you navigate through the menus!  Lastly, the two commentaries are a nice add-on.  One features the director Shawn Levy with the other one by Frankie Muniz.  Overall, I highly recommend this film.  Frankie and Amanda make an excellent team, and in picking up this film you are guaranteed to have some big fat fun.",1038182400,2,1947,4.543103448275862

""Big Fat Liar"" has everything for kids, and adults will also love it.  The movie pits young 14 year old Jason Shepard, an adept liar in his own right, against the viscious Marty Wolf, an expert liar who shows Jason how far a lie can go to destroy the lives of others.  Both hero and villain are closely linked, as Wolf is just like Shepard taken to an extreme, showing the young Jason what he could become as an adult if he doesn't learn his lesson.  The film is a perfect vehicle for actor Frankie Munez, who shines as Shepard and obviously has fun enacting revenge on Wolf, and both Munez and Amanda Bynes, who plays Jason's close friend, represent the youth of America in a positive way.  Paul Giamatti is the perfect Marty Wolf, who vows to never admit the truth even in the face of humiliation.  This is a must-see family movie.",1033257600,,946,4.371428571428571
