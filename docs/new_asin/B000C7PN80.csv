No stranger to media that is an aide to relaxation or resonating quiet sits, I thought I would enjoy this. It just comes off cheaply made and the music is lousy, IMO. Oh well, a loss. Maybe the library will take it as a donation, but then again... why would I do that to my local library? Pah...",1354838400,,423,4.367088607594937
