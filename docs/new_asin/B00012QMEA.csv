8005681,4,B00012QMEA,"The movie opens with the adult Minerva living in the U.S. in a failed marriage, disillusioned by her inability to be a writer, and tortured by the painful memories from her childhood. So she takes off and returns to the home of her youth in Mexico where she relives her childhood memories as we watch them on the screen. Though this is a painful process at times, she comes to understand herself and others better as she ponders the reasons for the things that happened to her. One of her fondest memories was of her Uncle Alberto whom she adored, but who later betrayed her for reasons she could not understand as a child.

This movie is about a woman who finds redemption through reliving her past and it sets her free. The actress who played Minerva as a child was an extraordinarily beautiful girl named Martha Lorena Osuna, age 10, who was wonderful in this role. As a child, Minerva had attended a Catholic boarding school in Mexico where she had a close friend, Beatriz, played wonderfully by Ariadna Islas, also about 10. They had many adventures together and dreamed of amazing things that would happen in their lives.

Though there is a scene of child nudity, it is not gratuitous and does not detract from the film. I recommend this film to anyone ages 16 and up. My only piece of advice: watch the film carefully, maybe even watch it twice as I did. There is so much in this film, and it jumps back and forth without notice from present day to the days of the woman's childhood. It can be hard for some to follow. But it's worth the time and effort to watch it. There really is magic in memories, if you know how to appreciate them.",1322438400,5,1644,4.440397350993377
8005682,4,B00012QMEA,"One of the best Mexican made movies in decades. English subtitles. All star Mexican cast; however, the theme of the movie is focused on a young starlet, Martha Lorena Osuna (10-years-old). Note: This film may be offensive to an American audience due to the child brutality, child exploitation and child nudity.",1240876800,,310,5.098039215686274
8005683,4,B00012QMEA,"This movie, made in 1999, could have been a precursor to Pans's Labyrinth for all its similarities:  a child uses her imagination as the only escape from brutality; someone she loves abandons her, someone is presumed guilty for an offence he did not commit, the child keeps a secret to protect an adult, and at the end everything makes more sense.

My version is from desert mountain media and the subtitles were great.

I thought the story was compelling, the actors were good, the ""magic"" made sense (rather than just functioning as an add-on), the photography was great, and the peek into Mexican culture was interesting to me (I am a gringuita).  My only criticism is that the part in the beginning (at the hotel) didn't seem to me to fit into the overall movie as well as it could have, but it was really a relatively minor flaw, and it may not even be a flaw to others.  I'm glad I bought it.",1215993600,13,898,4.451219512195122
8005684,3,B00012QMEA,"It looks like this could be a good movie, but . . . (& for English speaking people, it is a BIG 'but')  This movie has the worst subtitling of any movie I have ever seen, and I've watched subtitled movies in the hundreds because I am reserching a book on movies dealing with children.  Time and time again the subtitles will have the first part of a sentence, and then just quit.  If you understand Spanish, you can turn off the subtitles and enjoy what looks like it could be a good movie.  If your Spanish is 'rusty' like me (it's been 15 years since I've use it much) you will get a little more out of the movie than one who doesn't understand it at all, but not enough to make it worth buying or renting this movie.

So, again I say, it looks like it could be a good movie about a childhood experience that affects the little girl's adult life, but I can't say positively for sure.",1198713600,4,885,4.152046783625731
