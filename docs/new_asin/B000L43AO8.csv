Does any county want what they consider a transient people  roaming the streets without jobs, no. To deport these people for that seems harsh and bigoted.  As far as  sexuality  and clothing of choice, that's their business. A question, to the paper dolls, why choose Island?",1439251200,,413,4.814285714285714

8160140,5,B000L43AO8,"Tomer Heymann's documentary Paper Dolls is fabulous!  Entertaining and moving at the same time, thoughtful, political and intimate.  The film follows the filmmaker as he learns more about the Dolls, and his affection for them is palpable.  The film is hilarious, but also touches on the legal, political, religious and social challenges faced by the Dolls.  I adore the Dolls, and I adore this film.",1306972800,,399,5.092307692307692
8160141,4,B000L43AO8,"The Paper Dolls usually perform for Filipino audiences.  When they performed for a mainstream Israeli one, they were overshadowed by the hot, muscle-bound, naked dancer on stage.  This is similar to a huge problem in this work.
The director in the film is often seen here.  He is hot, hot, hot!  Even the Paper Dolls acknowledge it.  He has that Jeremy Piven or Eric Bana type of hotness.  So it's hard to focus on the main subjects when his beauty upstages them.
The director seems like a nice, progressive guy.  Still, he needs to be modeling or in a blue movie or working with Zeb Atlas or something.  His pulchritude was distracting.",1250553600,,637,4.625
8160142,4,B000L43AO8,"*Paper Dolls* is about a Filipino transvestite troupe living in Israel.  These Filipino transvestite are caregivers by day and performers by night.  Actually, throughout the week, they take care of elderly Jewish men.  On their nights off, they perform as Paper Dolls in various places.

I thought it was a wonderful documentary with an interesting angle about Filipino transvestites living in Israel and take care of elderly Jewish men.  Some of these Jewish men are not aware of the other lives of these transvestites.  The others are and simply do not care.  All they care is that they're treated well and looked after.  These Filipinos have no problem doing their day jobs because they believe it is part of their own culture to take care of the elders.

This documentary focuses on several issues: immigration, religion, homosexuality, night life and of course, politics.  While life may seem to be better for these transvestite Filipinos in Israel, they are aware that they're just strangers in a strange land.  Soon, they must think of their future and unfortunately, it isn't Israel.

While I thought it was an interesting documentary, I felt that their performances as Paper Dolls wasn't really up to par or at least mesmerizing.  Even the people who saw their show felt they were amateurish.  I've seen plenty of drag shows and the good ones are able to knock the socks off of you.  This troupe didn't.  So, to watch this, set your expectations low.",1182470400,6,1459,4.893877551020408
