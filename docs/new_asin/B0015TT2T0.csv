He worked with Dardano Sachetti and Dario Argento numerous times. I think it would be fair to say that the peak of his horror films popularity was at the end of the 80's and beginning of the 90's. The Torturer was made in 2005, i think Lamberto wanted to let us know that he's  still very good at what he does. After seing this film, it was clear to me that he's still a master when it comes to horror films. I think this was also his response to this new wave of slasher and torture movies we are seing more and more with movies like saw and hostel. Like i said before they are not my favourite kind of horror films but are still great to watch from time to time.

Lamberto set the bar really high with this film. This movie will be hard to beat, besides all torture and murder stuff, Lamberto is still offering us everything he always liked in a horror film: Really excellent cinematography, female nudity, lots of screams and lots of blood!!  The end of the movie also reminded me of DEMONS with the big screen and everything.....very nice scenes!

The movie is about director Alex Scerba, who's famous for his shocking films and disturbing effects. Alex is looking for actresses that won't be scared of playing their role to the fullest with disturbing elements and scary suggestions. Ginette, a young actress, will make the auditions for alex's next movie, along with other girls, they will be interviewed one by one to see if they have the right profile for his next film. Ginette will realise that her friend that disappeared a few days before, also auditioned for Alex......

If you are familiar with Lamberto's work you can definitely get your hands on this, it should bring you back in time and satisfy your hunger. I would also recommend it to anyone that liked saw or hostel or anyone that would be interested in watching a good shocker......I liked the review by Cirenelle, i do believe it is bava's most shocking and extreme film to date........

ENJOY!!!!",1327104000,3,2093,4.60752688172043
8259853,5,B0015TT2T0,"A deafening music soundtrack heralds titles which come up over the preparation of instruments of torture. Lamberto isn't messing! There is a theater where interviews take place and an impressive but spooky-looking villa, and the whole area seems permanently in the grip of an elecrical storm. Attractive young females wander about in the pouring rain like Sadie Frost in Dracula and then disappear. 2 characters have a romantic liaison and they like eating out and then having sex in his plush apartment, in fact the proceedings have a glossy look until it rains, then its back to the villa and the action. There is partial female nudity and the body count is 5 but all the victims are graphic and bloody. This is one of only a handfull of Gialli made in the noughties. It runs 95m, not 82m as stated, and is from Dania Film and Film Media who do an excellent uncut print of Martyrs. 16/9. R0.",1315872000,2,893,4.622641509433962
8259854,4,B0015TT2T0,"This is a wild erotic horror / torture movie featuring some incredibly gorgeous actresses, decent suspense, brutal kills and a fast pace. Lamberto Bava (son of legendary Italian horror director Mario Bava) has had a career of hit and misses but I'm glad to say that this is one of his best movies to date. While many genre movie makers tend to fill their running times with scenes we horror fans could care less about, Bava apparently respects his audience and tends to keep up the pace. He delivers the goods continuously, resulting in a movie that is never boring. He fills the screen with plenty of beautiful women and elements that horror fans are used to seeing but never seem to tire of: several strange yet sexy casting auditions, some nice scenes of suspense, ample nudity, decent chase scenes, several scenes of the obligatory 'bound and gagged damsel menaced by a cruel fiend', shocking scares, brutal bloody kills, and a nail-biting climax that neatly wraps up this twisted present for genre fans. You'll probably guess the 'twist' ending early on (which is the movie's only real flaw in my opinion) but it's still a wild ride worth taking if you like the aforementioned elements. It's not incredibly original but it is all highly entertaining. Still, it's easy to see why this movie hasn't been released in the U.S. in its uncut form. It's the kind of horror movie they USED to make quite often but is sure to offend today's overly sensitive gender police.",1279152000,2,1468,4.76078431372549
