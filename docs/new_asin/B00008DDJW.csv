The Make Believe DVD is made like a show with skits. This was more of a live concert. My children wouldn't even watch 5 minutes of this. It was a waste of time and money. I don't recommend this unless your child enjoys live concert.",1268956800,2,401,4.0886075949367084
1839926,5,B00008DDJW,"My sisters and I grew up on Sharon, Lois and Bram and their crazy elephant!  Now that I have a 14 month old who has never been interested in TV whatsoever, I thought that getting the ABC dvd was going to be fruitless.  LUCKILY I *finally* get a break as my little girl LOVES this DVD!!!  It makes my sister and I so happy that she loves it as much as we did ;)
If you're considering it, you've got to understand that yes, it's silly...and it's not a teaching tool.  It's for FUN!  But the singing, music, colors, etc. are stimulating enough to a child young enough at a year!  Buy this DVD, you'll finally get a break to do something for yourself!",1241395200,,647,4.17741935483871
1839927,5,B00008DDJW,"Pay no attention to Livymom unless you're one of those psycho crazy new parents who think that your kid performing letters and counting to ten makes them something special. I'm a parent of a now twenty-seven year old highly gifted child. She was talking in whole sentences at twelve months, reading at three, went to first grade at five, graduated from high school at 16 and college at 20.  All this without the benefit of ever counting to ten (who cares if you don't know what ""ten"" really is) or reciting the alphabet (again, it's much better to know what a letter sounds like than to be a robot recitation machine).  My secret?  Nothing magic here just little if any television/videos before age three, lots of reading with at least one book every night before bed and the world's supply of music, especially Sharon Lois and Bram!

Now I'm a new grandma and what is the wee one going to do at Nana's all day?  We're singing and dancing and reading lots of books.  Sorry Livymom, but you're raising a pretentious little performing geek!!  I raised a child with a love of language, books and music. And there's no better music for a child than the music of Sharon, Lois and Bram.",1204761600,18,1180,4.537735849056604
1839928,5,B00008DDJW,"I'm 22 years old and have two nieces (15 months and 5 years old). I also rented it from public library. THEY LOVED IT! No, the ABC's are not sung traditionally. I personally enjoyed the fact that they changed the melody.
Sharon, Lois, and Bram are about having fun and singing songs. They are like the old school Laurie Berkner Band.

This DVD is definitely not a teaching tool. The main focus is more so on the music than it is teaching the letters of the alphabet. The letters are pronounced and shown, but then a song or little skit follows. Visually...transitions from letter to letter are a bit weird. The technology behind it is very low budget. But most kids, unlike some grownups, are not concerned that the transitions are very 80's-90's. My nieces didn't care that some songs were from a concert or sung in front of a green screen. They loved the songs and loved dancing to them.

If you are not a child of the 80's who understands this crazy group of people with an elephant, you might as well get a different DVD. Since the simplicity of fun will clearly go over your head. But I highly recommend it because it is something that you and your child will have fun dancing to and learning new songs.",1189209600,10,1208,4.436936936936937
1839929,4,B00008DDJW,"I got it used, and one day my daughter picked it out randomly to watch.  Ever since then, she watches it at least once a day.  This is a very good buy for children who already no the basics of the Alphabet, and love to sing and dance.",1138492800,,234,3.8541666666666665
1839930,1,B00008DDJW,"I rented this DVD from the public library hoping my 17 month old would enjoy it while learning some ABCs. When it came on, my child immediately turned away and asked to see Baby Einstein. She likes to see real children and people and objects beeing portrayed on-screen which is why I thought this would be good. The DVD starts with Sharon, Lois & Bram on-stage in colorful getups dancing and singing a superfast rendition of the ABC song that is NOT the traditional one we are all used to. They are in front of a studio audience of children and parents who are also dancing around. It then cuts away to various scenes that fail miserably at trying to present the letters of the alphabet. Most of the scenes don't even make any sense at all and fail at teaching the child what letter they are even talking about. I must say that I stopped the DVD half-way thru when it became crystal clear that my child was not going to sit thru it, and I could barely stand it myself. I am so glad I did not waste my money on this as it would have ended up in a garage sale or donation pile. I think i'll put the money toward another Baby Einstein DVD.",1136592000,,1136,4.215596330275229
