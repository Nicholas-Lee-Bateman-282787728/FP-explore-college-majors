Reading the other reviews posted implies to me that there are actually two seperate videos, and that some people are being sent the wrong one.  -Disappointed.",1021420800,,301,4.882352941176471
7904878,1,B000006QTG,"In this 50 minute video, the word Acura is not mentioned until 40 minutes into it and the NSX comes up when there are less than 7 minutes left! It's really the history of Honda. It starts when Mr. Honda was an auto mechanic and goes through the history of him starting with creating motorized bicycles through the introduction of the Honda Civic. It's only in the last few minutes that there is any mention of the NSX. I was amazed that they had the nerve to include NSX in the title of this video. If you want the history of honda, then it's not a bad video, if you want inside NSX info, you will be very disappointed.",1018396800,,619,4.2100840336134455
