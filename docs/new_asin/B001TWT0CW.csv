3794400,5,B001TWT0CW,"When I read the reviews on this site about various peoples remarks about the issues of a good many of the TV series transfers to DVD, I notice that a good many are nothing but MOANERS. They moan about the slightest thing,sometimes not even knowing what they are talking about. They moan about sets being split in two, they moan about the value, the way they are packaged, the fact that there are no EXTRAS. One reviewer under the name of 'MovieMan' from Los Angeles writes the following remarkes about GUNSMOKE Season 2-Vol. 1
---------------------------------------------------

""I recall a reviewer indicating Paramount/CBS botched Season 2 Volume 1 because they pulled episodes from another season and placed them on this volume...and people are paying for the mess.""
---------------------------------------------------------

I have this season and all episodes are intact and belong to the appropiate season as well as being in date order - they are not a mess.

I really do not know why so many complain at the value of a lot of these sets, such as ""Gunsmoke"" ""Rawhide"" ""The Untouchables"" and many more by the well studios like CBS.

The digitally re-mastered quality of these type of DVDs are excellent and represent usually very good value for money. A lot of Americans do not know how lucky they are with the prices.  If supposedly buyers keep on complaining about such paltry issues as I have described then it may well put studios off from producing these high quality and very entertaining programmes on to DVD, then they will have nothing.  I personally do not mind seasons being split up as they are easier to buy that way. Obviously it would be nice if series that were long running in their day, like ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Rawhide"" could be issued quicker than they are. For example ""Gunsmoke"" will take 20 years at the rate of present of issue.  I say to studios like ""Paramount/CBS"", keep up the good work, keep producing these excellent series of the past and keep up the excellent quality.  I am looking forward to owning the GUNSMOKE Season 3 - Vol. 2",1237507200,13,2066,4.849431818181818
3794401,5,B001TWT0CW,"The Gunsmoke episodes contained in this DVD are, like the rest of the early series, some of the edgiest and best written TV in history.  Battlestar Galactica reminds me a lot of the style that was exhibited in these episodes...life is not easy, and it doesn't always go the way we plan.  The b/w episodes of Gunsmoke are worth the effort and time (since CBS is only releasing them every 6 months) it takes to collect them.",1237161600,6,422,4.467532467532467
3794402,1,B001TWT0CW,"Terence Allen hit a ""bullseye"" with his review again, and I'll add...

In my opinion the Gunsmoke series is a classic five stars and needs no review as such. The longest running dramatic series in television history speaks for itself.

My continuing reviews reflect the release schedule fiasco and the accompanying pricing for the half seasons. Simple math...half seasons should be half priced. Paramount/CBS will continue the split season nonsense as long as there are buyers who ""buy in."" I stopped patronizing after season 1.

I recall a reviewer indicating Paramount/CBS botched Season 2 Volume 1 because they pulled episodes from another season and placed them on this volume...and people are paying for the mess.

Paramount/CBS did Season 1 right, and now they're deciding (with this series and some others) to reinvent the wheel. If it isn't broken, don't break it ;-)

Simple formula...Complete seasons at competitive pricing.",1237161600,7,934,5.283783783783784
3794403,1,B001TWT0CW,"""Gunsmoke-Season 3-Volume 2"" is the fourth release of the hopelessly misguided split season practice that puts devoted fans of this wonderful series even further out of hope that they will be able to collect the entire series on DVD.

The first season was issued in its entirety, and fans like me thought that the studio would do the right thing and release the series in single season sets. But after all of our hopes were raised by the first release, the second release dashed our hopes just as low.

If the studio never intended to release the entire series in DVD format, they should have waited. They may feel that they are saving money by doing this, but they are antagonizing many, many more fans with this practice.",1235520000,15,723,4.640625

After posting this review last month, I have been reading the other reviews and have noticed that many are giving these DVD's one or two stars due to the releases of Gunsmoke being split seasons. That is nonsense! I would rather have split seasons of Gunsmoke on DVD rather then no seasons of Gunsmoke on DVD!. Yes, I would love to have them released as full seasons, but that is not going to happen and I'm fine with that since I know I and millons of other Gunsmoke fans are lucky enough to have Gunsmoke being released on DVD in the first place. Keep up the complaints and CBS/Paramount might just say enough and stop with the releases. Just accept them the way they are being released and enjoy them! (Oh and as for the reviewer saying that they messed up Season 2 vol. 1 and we are paying for the mess up, that is bull. I have that season along the with the rest of the sets that were released and Vol. 1 of season 2 as well as the other sets have no such problems. All episodes are all there and are in order!)

5-3-2009: I have just found out thanks to another reviewer, who pointed out what to look for, that there is a mess up on Season two, volume 1. One episode ""How to cure a friend"" was replaced with ""How to kill a friend"" I apologize for not seeing it in the first place and saying that there was no mistake. I still give Gunsmoke and each season volume set that  has been released five stars despite this very small mess up and I still say that people should not give it a one or two star ratings due to  it being split seasons and they should just stop complaining. All the season sets released are great to watch and I am looking foward to buying season 3 vol. 2 in about three weeks.",1235520000,52,2255,4.24941724941725

3794413,5,B001TWT0CW,"This is one of the better seasons for this long running series; James Arness and Dennis Weaver receive nominations for best actor awards.
The show wins best an award for best dramatic series and two shows are nominated for individual awards.
This is the number one TV show for the season, well written with excellent acting and as good now as in the 1950s.
This is 1950s TV, small screen, black and white, just as it was presented at the time.

Marketing splits the season into two packages, the reason for most of the one-star reviews.
This set is about eight hours with some of the old commercials as an extra.
Gunsmoke always had excellent actors; part of the enjoyment is playing Whos that?",1473552000,,694,4.596774193548387

3794417,5,B001TWT0CW,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,883,4.966216216216216

3794460,5,B001TWT0CW,"Gunsmoke is a great 1/2 hour show that does not always end happy or the way you want it to. Matt makes law decisions on the fly if there is no court judge.  He shows compassion sometimes on the criminal's past and may look the other way as they slip away, but will smack a bad guy or drunk with the long barrel of his gun if he has to. He and doc and Chester constantly jab at each other which makes the shows fun to watch. Poor Matt gets shot in the arm or other places a lot, and he has to survive storms and knocks on the head or get into situations with Indians and usually sides with them in disputes.  This season is very good.",1399420800,,633,3.9375

3794489,5,B001TWT0CW,"I grew up watching Gunsmoke and I just love it, I watch every evening and has spent numerous hours watching the videos, when I found the dvd on amazon I was excited, I plan on purchasing more dvd's.  Matt Dillon is a Marshall that you can relate to and love he was a people person.",1300665600,,281,4.109090909090909
3794490,5,B001TWT0CW,"I won't repeat everything the other reviewers have said but just say that I agree. These were made when TV was trully a pleasurable form of entertainment and the stars of this series were good normal human beings off screen. Compare James Arness to today's Charlie Sheen and you'll see what I mean.
  The complaints about the way they are being released are justified and the guy who says we should stop complaining about getting ripped off or CBS might just stop making them must be kidding. They know when they have a good thing going and I'm sure as they get more of us hooked on collecting the set they will raise the price and probably divide it into even more DVDs. I only hope James Arness is getting a share of it but I really doubt that he is. Greedy CBS probably doesn't even know he exists anymore.
  I remember how we looked forward to Gunsmoke every week and I'm enjoying these early years even more than the later years that have been shown on TV Land and Encore in recent years. If todays TV shows were this good we wouldn't need 200 channels of ""nothing"".
  The only good thing about the way CBS is bringing them out.....My family always know what to get me for Christmas.",1290038400,,1188,4.401826484018265
3794491,5,B001TWT0CW,"Season 3 Vol 2 continues with the weekly episodes of Gunsmoke (1/25/58 to 6/7/58). Excellent picture (B&W), sound and format quality. These 30 min episodes are a must for any Gunsmoke/James Arness fan. Also includes approx 5-8 min of sponsor spots, which you can choose to view or not.  My only complaint is that these seasons are not being released soon enough. At the rate they're being released, I may not live long enough to get all 20 seasons.",1286236800,6,448,4.670886075949367
3794492,5,B001TWT0CW,What can one say about a western series that ran for 20 seasons.  Even as early as season 3 this western series was slated for greatness.  The episodes in this DVD package followed their winning format with a collection of great stories that were very real to life.  This one rates 5 stars as i indicated above.,1270857600,3,311,4.421052631578948
3794493,5,B001TWT0CW,We are so fortunate to have these programs available. Has anyone else noticed the similarities between Gunsmoke and the Andy Griffith show? I was floored when I read that Dennis Weaver and Don Knotts both passed away on the same day. Spooky connection.  I can hardly wait for season 4!,1268870400,,285,4.7
3794494,5,B001TWT0CW,"You don't have to be a fan of westerns to enjoy Gunsmoke. The show was, after all, wonderfully-written stories about people you could easily care about. Matt, Kitty, Doc and Chester came to be like family, and you wanted to invite them into your home each week. And I'm thinking there are probably lots of fans like me who grew up with only the color episodes. I'd heard about Chester and Quint, but I only knew Festus and Newly. These early episodes are a real treat. By Season 3, the cast had fully gelled and fleshed out their characters and relationships to one another. So, provided you don't always demand a happy ending (John Meston's writing was definitely not fairy tale), you won't be disappointed if you buy this wonderful boxed set. Thanks to the previous reviewer who listed all of the contained episodes - that helped me to add this one to my pretty extensive Gunsmoke collection. I'm off to buy Season 3, Volume 1 right now!",1266019200,3,939,4.595238095238095
3794495,5,B001TWT0CW,"What's there to say except more of the same from the previous early versions of Gunsmoke. Picture quality and sound is good from these early episodes. I'm sure many of you will recognize a lot of the different TV actors that appeared in Gunsmoke.

Must have DVD collection for the serious GUNSMOKE fan!",1264896000,,302,4.69811320754717
3794496,5,B001TWT0CW,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Gunsmoke is one of the finest shows ever aired on television: great acting, great writing, great cast. It really demonstrates what television is capable of. 'Nuff said.

I really wrote this review in reaction to the reviewers who complain that the sets have been released in two parts. The outrage they exhibit over this seems silly in the extreme. This DVD release is a gift at a tremendous price.  Period. -- Mykal",1263340800,2,448,4.730769230769231

3794499,5,B001TWT0CW,"I cannot get enough of James Arness and the Gunsmoke characters. Other reviewers are asking for the next releases to occur more frequently and I agree. You thirst for more after watching each year's set. If money is to be made here, they've obviously discovered a gold mine.

I logged onto the James Arness website about 4 years ago and love the monthly newsletters he puts out to his fans.  He has quite the following.  I also bought his autographed book and what a delight.  While reading the book it's hard not to imagine him reading it along with you.  He truly is my idol; hmmm, close to John Wayne?  I cannot make that call as I idolize them equally.",1248307200,11,656,4.425
3794500,5,B001TWT0CW,"We join others who are concerned about the Gunsmoke series being marketed on a piecemeal basis.  Most likely it is to increase income over time for the producers.  That strategy is probably making more people consider the pirated versions also available on the internet -- where all 20 years are sold at a proportionately lower price per season (I've read reports that the quality is not as good and may be taken in part from recording TV Nick at Night reruns).  I am certainly not recommending buying the pirated versions.  However, those who are producing the valid or authorized DVDs should stop unnecessarily delaying things by putting out a half season at a time.  Some of us who would like to see the Gunsmoke series may not live long enough.  Why not put them all out, and then offer a package deal for the whole set?  Also, the confused way of offering some combinations merely makes it more difficult to know what you're buying.  We've only started with season one, and the quality is good.  I assume it's good for all seasons  And if you're a Gunsmoke fan, of course the acting and story content are typically regarded as good.",1247443200,2,1137,4.64
3794501,5,B001TWT0CW,I really like this series.  My 4 yr old loves it.  He has renamed himself Marshall Dillon.,1247443200,,90,4.235294117647059
3794502,5,B001TWT0CW,"Being the first adult western series on early tv, Gunsmoke has never disappointed. The stories are short, entertaining, well written, well acted with some of the greatest character actors of all time. The regular cast interact with each other fabulously and James Arness is perfect as Marshall Matt Dillon. I just can't say enough good things about what I consider as the best tv series of all time.",1246924800,2,399,4.882352941176471
3794503,4,B001TWT0CW,"It would be great to have both volumes of a Gunsmoke season released at the same time, as CBS plans to do for volumes 1 and 2 of the first season of Bonanza, for it's 50th anniversary in September. Since these Gunsmokes episodes are only a half hour, viewers go through them quickly. Season three of Gunsmoke is fantastic television.

CBS, Please release seasons 4-6 of Have Gun Will Travel on the same schedule as Gunsmoke seasons 4-6.",1244505600,2,436,4.589743589743589

I have loved Gunsmoke and James Arness all my life.  I am soooo excited to get to see the early seasons that I can't remember as well as the later ones.  It's like getting to see a whole new show again.  I wish it had never ended, even after 20 seasons.
My motto is: ""Don't cry over the big stuff.  Just smile at the small""  Little by little we get to experience the tall, good looking guy again!",1243900800,2,548,3.8828828828828827

3794506,3,B001TWT0CW,"I recently recieved a pre-release copy of Gunsmoke, Season 3, Vol. 2. I will not comment on the split season but rather that according to a disclamer on the box ""Music has been changed on some of the episodes"". Now since I did not see this series back in 1958 I really have no idea how much music has been changed. I think its terrible how this keeps happening on TV show DVD's released by CBS/Paramount. I can accept the split season releases but can't this show be released with all its original music?",1242086400,11,504,4.372340425531915

8342391,4,B001TWT0CW,"The show itself, including season 3, is 5 star all the way. I'm giving it 4 stars, because the DVD packaging is incomplete, and though Amazon has tried its best to fix the situation, the problem is actually with CBS/Paramount Home Entertainment, and they won't answer their emails. If you order this volume, be aware there is NO artwork/episode list/description on the inside cover - it is completely blank - as there is with every other volume that has been released, and is standard for any TV show DVD set. It's a misprint/error at the CBS warehouse. People that bought this years ago, may have correct/complete packaging, but currently it is incomplete. Amazon customer service is first rate, and has replaced mine 3 times, but all 4 DVD cases have the same issue - they are BLANK INSIDE. You will not have any list of episodes or descriptions, to go with your DVDs. Still, it's a great watch, and I highly recommend this volume of Gunsmoke, but just know that the packaging is not right.
