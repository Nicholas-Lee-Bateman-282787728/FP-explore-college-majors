5929224,5,B00ENTX7JU,"I have been curious about SAVING GENERAL YANG for a while now, ever since I discovered Ronny Yu directed it.  Yu is an iconic director who has a couple of nice, cult horror hits under his belt, including BRIDE OF CHUCKY and one of my favorites, FREDDY VS. JASON.  I was expecting great things with this film, and Im very happy to report it blew my expectations away.

This is one of the best Well Go USA titles Ive seen this year.  It is a gripping story with believable characters and intense action.  But it is also a compelling period piece that shows the value of family and honor.  In short, the film is epic in scope and vision, as well as execution.

SAVING GENERAL YANG is shot very well and looks stunning onscreen.  The cinematography is a big part of what makes this movie so excellent from a visual standpoint.  It also helps convey the importance of key scenes and adds to the intensity of the battles.

The acting is superb as well.  The actors portraying the seven sons each do an outstanding job and bring their characters to life with vivid detail.  Their emotional performances lend a huge amount of credibility to the onscreen drama and set the tone for the film as a whole.

The battle sequences in SAVING GENERAL YANG  are also amazing, with (in my opinion) realistic depictions of what open-field combat would probably be like.  Theres martial-arts action, but its not the wire-work-filled displays that modern day audiences are used to; this is not a bad thing, as I love those kinds of movies as well.  But the lack of over-exaggerated fight scenes makes this movie even more believable.

SAVING GENERAL YANG is a huge win for me and I highly recommend it.  The film is available tomorrow in a variety of formats.",1386547200,22,1737,4.566343042071197

I love movies that are period pieces with action in it and this one fits the bill.  It is supposedly based on one of China's great generals and his family.

5929248,5,B00ENTX7JU,Absolutely loved it !  I was actually surprised of how good this film really was.  The story-line was very good and all of the acting was top notch.  With most martial art films it's hard to find both good story line and acting but this had best of both worlds.  I highly recommend it for all martial art fans.  This was by far one of the best martial arts films I have seen and could easily go in my top 10.,1409616000,,408,3.9876543209876543

5929259,5,B00ENTX7JU,"Saving Gen Yang is a good movies, which has action,family and culture from China at the Eastern regions. Good sons,within good family,always saving their father in any situations,circumstances and died for family as all costs. It's not a movie for children under 14 year of age nor for family without supervision by adult. Family is for all,bother for bother when their father is old,weak and not at all from his youth. But sometimes other generals as friend will be their enemy when problem with trouble comes into the family. It is a real story,document,and history from China. However,neither these brothers nor the father have any plans,strategies and ideas for military. Good martial art,for good family,as not from family in today's world. Highly,recommend,for family orient,from the kind of person. No value in family,no need to watch this movie.",1401840000,,853,5.233576642335766

5929263,4,B00ENTX7JU,I thought that this movie's story was a great story of love for family and how far they were willing to go to preserve their love of family. From the previews I thought that there were going to be a lot of fighting because it was about war. The story made up for the lack of the fighting that I thought I would see.,1398038400,,315,3.9375

For me, it was a perfect blend of history and legend. I enjoy movies that take the time with detail. The movie gave me a glimpse into history and what life was like during that time. The battle scenes were exciting and did not hold back. The costumes were awesome. The scenery was great. I had a lot of fun watching this movie.",1394582400,,465,4.295454545454546
5929266,4,B00ENTX7JU,"I have read the reviews with some bemusement, some viewers seem to still have their heads in ku fu movies. This is a terrific film with all the tragedy of Shakespeare. I am a former producer and know something of the technical difficulties that went into a film like this and this matches anything we are doing here with a fraction of the budget. The east is producing some fine films that are obviously influenced by the west yet they have made it their own. On the big screen this would have been sensational. It is no accident that a film like The Grandmaster drew the attention of the academy this year. These filmmakers are becoming as influential as those of our generation of the 1970's. Do not miss this one.",1394236800,,716,4.473282442748092
5929267,5,B00ENTX7JU,"This movie reminds me  a lot of Dynasty Warriors, but a bit more realistic. Very good fight choreography with cool costumes and acting. A must see for chinese medieval war enthusiasts!",1394236800,,184,4.935483870967742
5929268,4,B00ENTX7JU,"I'd recommend it & I enjoyed it but some of the brothers' characters seemed forced. If you look closely you can see rubber swords bending in fights & the extras are terrible, but still good overall, I guess i'm just picky :p",1394150400,,224,4.357142857142857
5929269,4,B00ENTX7JU,i enjoyed this movie very much because it has a simple but good plot and lots of action. i would watch again in the future.,1393545600,,123,3.96
5929270,3,B00ENTX7JU,Nothing really special or horrible about this flick.  It seems to be the standard HK is kicking out these days. It's like they're sleep walking through the genre now and just milking it without the old school love.,1393459200,,214,4.631578947368421
5929271,4,B00ENTX7JU,Enjoyed the film but I wanted a fuller treatment of General Yang and the bond he had with his family.,1393459200,,101,4.1
5929272,4,B00ENTX7JU,"I'm actually quite surprised at the number of negative reviews regarding this movie. Not only on here, but from critics as well. Goes to show that I always don't agree with the majority. I read about this movie and was wanting to watch it for awhile and when it came out, well, I was on it.
  First off, I am already very familiar with the story of the Yang Family. It is a very well known story and I also picked up quite a bit more of the story watching The Young Warriors, one of the Chinese television series. That series is long- around 43 episodes but did a really good job with all of the family members. If you are interested in this family story, then I would suggest that series to watch. The Yang story is good but also sad since the outcome never really changes in the fate of this family.
  The entire premise of this movie is largely set around a specific battle in which General Yang ( patriarch) of the family goes off to war and gets abandoned with his soldiers in a closed off area while he is being hunted down by Yelu Yuan (bad guy) who is set on his own mission by his Empress to take down the Yang Clan as well as settling his own personal vendetta. The movie paces around the suspense of Yelu Yuan chasing down the father and brothers. That is basically it in a nutshell. The plot line is simple while the movie focuses more on the suspense and the fighting scenes and the overall theme of love, honor, and family.
  I understand that most of the remakes take their own spin on the legend and this one from what I understand did stick with some of the details of the story and also spun their own version on what  happened as well so I was prepared for that and I really didn't see anything that was so out of the blue that was hugely different than what I had seen prior.  Plot was condensed more but you would have to with this story because it's really hard to compress months worth of action, emotions, etc., in a movie that is over in two hours.
  This movie was a tad bit confusing to the average person just watching this with no prior knowledge of the history of the story so I can see where people were frustrated with the lack of details and the lack of character development. Well, honestly, with seven sons it would definitely eat up quite of screen time to show their back stories so I would suggest watching one of the series to get more backstory to each of the brothers or read up on them. I definitely think that since I had the background information the movie made more sense to me and I didn't mind the little details that didn't get explained or how the movie skipped around at times.
  The biggest reason on why I wanted to watch this film was because Ronnie Yu directed it. I have always been a big fan since he did The Bride With the White Hair- and I wanted to see how this would translate into this movie. I didn't think this was as great as The Bride- that will always be one of my favorite movies- but I honestly didn't think this movie was so bad as to warrant the terrible reviews on this.  Far from it. I enjoyed the performances of Adam Cheng, Ekin Cheng, and Raymond Lam and there were also some other actors that I had seen in other movies but noticed in minor roles here. I wouldn't say that the acting was horrible but it may not have been very memorable either. The brothers didn't really develop much character depth to distinguish from one another- I agree with another reviewer that some of the brothers were hard to tell apart- but in this movie, it was enough to convey the overall tone of the film- that the family and honor is worth fighting for. Basically all for one and one for all mentality. There were several parts in the film that reminded me of Yu's older works- he does like to use flashbacks to make thing more poignant, and he does that again in this film. The imagery, costumes and fighting scenes were decent. You had more hand to hand combat rather than flying around which is more realistic, and there were a few scenes that reminded me of War of the Arrows. It's not maybe as epic as you would think it would be and maybe a bit stretching of plausibility at some parts but it still was far from the worst movie that I have watched. Bottom line- you may enjoy this more if you knew the story beforehand.",1393286400,,4285,4.262315270935961
5929273,5,B00ENTX7JU,"It has great martial art action, a good plot and it brings out emotions. I would tell anyone who likes martial art movies to watch this movie. Also has a nice twist.",1392595200,,165,4.1875
5929274,5,B00ENTX7JU,Liked the cinematography and historic battle scenes and the costumes. Had a good plot as well. Would recommend to watch even with subtitles.,1392422400,,140,5.130434782608695
5929275,4,B00ENTX7JU,I enjoyed this movie. Im not really deep in to the history of these kind of movies. I just like worrior type movies. They are intertaining on a laid back kind of day/night for me.,1392163200,2,179,4.142857142857143
5929276,2,B00ENTX7JU,"Poor special effects, and weak story line. Sorry, I was not impressed. I know guys who could have edited this movie their phone with more passion.",1391299200,,146,4.653846153846154
5929277,5,B00ENTX7JU,This was a yes movie.  One of those foreign movies that you don't even notice that it is captioned because so much is going on.  Really a surprise ending also,1391299200,,158,4.233333333333333
5929278,5,B00ENTX7JU,Very good movie with an excellent twist to it that you never see coming. Very interesting story line on this movie.,1391299200,,115,4.523809523809524
5929279,5,B00ENTX7JU,I've seen the Shaw Brothers version of this movie that starred Gordon Liu and Alexander Fu Sheng so I already had an idea of what this movie might be like. Although similar in story line it was actually a very different movie. Very entertaining and packed with lots of action. I'm glad I purchased this movie for download so I can watch it as many times as I like compared to renting it. I'm a big fan of martial arts films and this one ranks right up there as one of my favorites.,1391212800,,481,4.182795698924731
5929280,4,B00ENTX7JU,"Initially, I did not want to rent this movie because it was subtitled. However, it was excellent spoken in native tongue and I enjoyed it immensely!
A little fast paced and could have used a little more depth, but all around entertaining.
Great story, martial arts and ending.
What more can you want for 4 bucks!
Rent it.",1391212800,,321,4.551724137931035
5929281,4,B00ENTX7JU,"Saving General Yang is based on an episode in the stories collectively known as Generals of the Yang Family. Set in early days of Chinas Song dynasty (9601279), the film follows the story of military family the Yangs. When the Khitan armies arrive from the north to invade the country, their father General Yang goes to the battlefield, but, severely wounded, he is left behind the enemy line with a handful of warriors.

The films title refers to the heroic fights of the familys seven sons, who set out to rescue their father. Now the problem of this film adaptation is that those who do not know the source material will find the story rushed and characters flat. There are so many characters in a comparatively short film, so some viewers may ask themselves while watching the film: So, who is this General Pan Renmei?

Even so, action sequences are pretty impressive. Saving General Yang is directed by Ronny Yu, better known among English-speaking audiences as the director of Bride of Chucky and Freddy vs. Jason. I haven't heard his name quite a while, but Yu is no stranger to Chinese martial arts films, his last film being Fearless back in 2006. You cannot expect Jet Lis fighting skills here, but combat scenes are powerful and brutal enough.

So is the film good? Well, I think so. Saving General Yang suffers from the uneven pace and some bad CGI, but is worth watching for its combat sequences.",1391126400,14,1409,4.696356275303644
5929282,5,B00ENTX7JU,"It was a great film. I am glad it was not dubbed, although you have the choice. I like for the character to speak the language they were meant to speak and read the subtitles. story of seven sons, going to rescue their father after taken prisoner by the opposite gang. Not quite the same, but kinda of reminds you of the ""magnificent seven"" or ""samurai"" although in no way this gets to be to be high a caliber of a film, but is way up there, good entertainment.",1390953600,,461,4.191011235955056

5929284,5,B00ENTX7JU,"As I watch this film I thought of how ""SACRED"" it is to have a family.  Yes, ""Saving General Yang"" is all about family, tradition, but more importantly, it's about sacrifices that ""must be made"" to keep one's family whole.  This movie delivers an underlying message, and in every category captures the very essence of what it means to have a family today.  So, whether you have a small or large family or whether you are a media enthusiast as I am, this film is one for your collection. The plot and fighting scenes are all great and very well choreographed so I'm giving it five stars.",1390521600,,586,4.457943925233645

5929286,5,B00ENTX7JU,"My reviews have been sparse of late.  I wanted to review this one because the professional critics really got it wrong.  This is a Chinese film made for Chinese.  Some of the reviewers complained that it required historical knowledge.  Well, duh!  If they're too lazy to take the time to find out a little about a culture they don't understand, they should leave the criticism to someone that does.

This is an excellent film.  Compared to many, it hews pretty close to the historical record.  It is a drama, however and a war film.  It succeeds in those aspects at least as well.  Some critics found the film hard to follow.  I didn't.  The flashback scenes made perfect sense within the context of the film and serve as an excellent mechanism to provide background information, rather than trying to cover the background at the beginning, which would probably make the film longer and harder to follow (Red Cliff does that well, but it's a 4 hour movie).

The battle scenes are as good as any I've seen (possibly excepting Red Cliff, which is the best war movie I've ever seen, period.).

See this movie.  Watch it in Mandarin with English subtitles so you can get a sense of what the actors are trying to convey.  And do your homework; at least learn a little about the Song dynasty.  It will make the film even more enjoyable.",1390089600,31,1330,4.567796610169491

5929293,4,B00ENTX7JU,I liked this movie overall BUT the placement and font of the subtitles were aggravating. We watch a lot of Chinese and Korean movies and this movie ranks right up there with a 4 for the movie and at times zero for the subtitles being a major distraction.,1388707200,,254,4.3125

5929296,5,B00ENTX7JU,"This film is in the vein of Red Cliff, but stresses the story of family love and codes of honor. The fight scenes of course are bloody as war truly is and touching as tragedy is. This movie is another that will be a favorite of Kung fu movie collectors. Don't miss it!",1388361600,,268,4.0754716981132075
5929297,5,B00ENTX7JU,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. It combines a good story with excellent cinematography, great sets, excellent period costumes and weapons, powerful acting, and non-stop action. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the new Chinese historical films. It certainly ranks as among the best.",1388275200,,287,5.6976744186046515
5929298,2,B00ENTX7JU,"I saw 1/2 of this movie on the airplane.  So so the war sequences didn't wow me as much, and instead the holes in the story are so glaring it's impossible to ignore.  I was interrupted, but never felt the desire to finish watching it.  You watch this movie for the fighting sequences, so if you are ok with that, then it's a pretty good movie.  But that's not enough for me.

1)  The father was sent to war, and was trapped.  What happens next doesn't make sense at all.  Shouldn't the emperor, or the army, do something official?  Even if they have decided it's a lost cause, and let them die, then you shouldn't be allowing random family members to go in for their own independent rescue.  If the family members happens to be the best 7 warriors in the land...then why the heck aren't they part of the army but instead running around with their own agenda?

2)  ""7 must go, but only 6 will return"".  The wizard tells the matriarch, who obviously believes what the wizard says 100%.  Then why did she let them go?  Trade one of the sons for the father?  Really?  Then the oldest son says something like ""I'll be the one to die"" etc etc.

I didn't see the ending, so not sure if one of the brothers died.  But that's not the point anyways, as the matriarch made a weird choice that no one in their right mind would make.  If I'm the patriarch, and I came back and find out she knew one of my sons would die to rescue me...I wouldn't be happy.

It's hard to watch a movie when there are such glaring holes.",1388016000,4,1505,4.2105263157894735
5929299,5,B00ENTX7JU,The Yang family really did live through this chaotic set of events.  The action line is well done with just enough contextual information that you are able to get a realistic estimate of what happened.  The movie is worth watching!,1387584000,6,231,4.75
5929300,3,B00ENTX7JU,"It would have been nice to know *before* I rented the movie that this movie was not in English; the subtitles move very fast in some scenes and had to back the movie up several times in order to understand what was said.  The movie would have been better if it has been in English; even if they had to insert the choppy typewriter like language, it would have made a difference.",1387152000,4,378,4.25
