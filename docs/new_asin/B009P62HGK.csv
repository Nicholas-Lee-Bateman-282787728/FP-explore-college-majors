8543526,5,B009P62HGK,"Taylor Mason is unbelievably gifted, and it really shows in this video.  If we have a Ventriloquist Comedian Laureate, it should be he.  There is so much hilarious stuff here, and the way Taylor interacts with the audience is just wonderful. I just love the bit in the extras (which, BTW, there are a lot of) where we see the world through Romeo's eyes. Brilliant!",1354233600,,364,4.584615384615384
