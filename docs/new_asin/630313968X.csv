8178841,1,630313968X,"As I explained before, I don't think this is an original DVD; I think it was taken from a VHS tape and recorded directly onto a DVD-R.  The picture quality is awful and the plastic wrapping is so cheap and not professionally done, meaning it was done at home. Shame on you for selling garbage like this.",1378080000,,303,4.315789473684211
8178842,3,630313968X,"Despite the Monkey King being on the cover, the film has absolutely nothing to do with him.  In fact, the hero (who is a bit of a trickster like Monkey) learns Crab Fist, not a monkey style.  The transfer is very bad - many flaws on the film, full frame, and the screen even goes black for a few seconds in the middle!  Luckily, I still think goofy dubs are fun, which is why this still gets 3 stars.",1139702400,,400,4.037974683544304
8178843,4,630313968X,"I was given this movie as a gift and we both expected some character to pop up with face paint.  Unfortunately, the only face painted character you'll see is on the cover of the case.

The movie was actually humorous and very entertaining.

My recommendation:  watch it with a group of people!",1139616000,2,293,4.576923076923077
8178844,3,630313968X,"i was a bit disappointed with this movie, i bought it thinking it showed the Monkey Style , it doesnt however,
it is a man who is sent away from home by his father who is a fighting master, to only return when he is a good fighter.
he pretty much wanders around spying on people and getting in fights with a group of evil kung fu guys, he gets set to learn kung fu from a master he comes across but the master is killed by the group mentioned above. the master while dying tells him to be a great fighter to watch reflections in the water and to copy himself and he would surely be a great man. He studies the movements of a crab and of each member of the group and then gets revenge.
okay movie , a little boring and no Monkey style.",986428800,2,734,3.9662162162162162
