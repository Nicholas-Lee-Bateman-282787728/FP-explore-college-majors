7844794,5,6303388078,"I used to always watch The Puzzle Place when I was a little kid. It's a great show for children. I purchased it so my kids will be able to watch it. There aren't any really good shows for kids anymore. This show teaches about virtues, honesty, sharing, friendship, and many other subjects that children should learn about.",1358812800,,322,4.568965517241379
