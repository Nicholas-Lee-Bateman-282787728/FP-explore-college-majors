3159521,1,B0016MJ6JM,"Wow, what is there to say except this has to be the dumbest movie I have ever seen. If you are dumb enough to buy into the global warming lie, then this vapid movie might be just what you've been looking for.",1217203200,12,208,3.9761904761904763
3159522,1,B0016MJ6JM,"I had great hopes for the movie after reading a positive review for it over two years ago that compared it in some ways to John Carpenter's The Thing remake.
After finally finding wide release I was excited to see what was touted by many to be a very good horror movie.
I should have known better though after the disappointment that was Fessenden's Wendigo.
The Last Winter is the story of oil drillers looking to exploit the massive reserves of crude buried beneath the Alaskan wilderness. Slowly each one of the characters begins to fall victim to a mysterious and contagious madness as the ice begins to melt unleasing ""ghost caribou,"" I'm not making that up, CGI ghost caribou.
Anyway, while the movie may or may not intentionally espouse the misguided and cultish poli-pseudo-science that is global warming, the story and scares suck either way.
I was wholey disappointed by this movie which played something like a cross between an arthouse snoozer and a sci-fi channel original movie.
I will give The Last Winter this, however, it's refreshing to see James LeGros back at work and the storyline, while stupid and unfrightening, is at least original and an interesting concept which I imagine served as the basis for M. Knight Shamalamadingdong's most recent rip off, The Happening.
Bottomline, unless you're a fan of pretenious garbage that feigns intellectual depth and or the atrocious cinema the Sci-fi channel pumps out each year, you aren't going to like The Last Winter.",1215993600,11,1484,4.94
3159523,2,B0016MJ6JM,"I'm having a hard time deciding what I like least about this film. I'm torn between the horrible acting (Ron Pearlman...he must have needed the paycheck but he just phoned this one in), the quasi-scientific babble, or the rediculous ghostly manifestations of the Earth spirit.

I'm not going to politicize the film like some others, although the elements of global warming alarmists and anti-drilling activists are easily deciphered. These things were used as a backdrop, not a statement. Ultimately this was intended to be a horror movie, but it fell completely flat.

For a genuinely great horror film about people isolated in a frozen wasteland confronting an ancient evil, watch The Thing. This film should be buried under the ice and forgotten as quickly as possible.",1215993600,10,772,5.119047619047619
3159524,3,B0016MJ6JM,"I have to admit, I was intriqued at first.  The jargon was good.  I was hooked, and how the actors played their part, I was digging it.  There was the normal scientific talk, you know, global warming, figures and numbers, important meetings at the top of the world to discuss America becoming oil independepent....but then all of a sudden it got very unscientific and changed to weird.

I was wondering what in the world the boy was seeing, and eventually my question was asked. And then when I got to the ending, I was like...huh, I know they weren't finished..but they were.  Maybe, the movie makers were trying to rush to get finished before a set time or something.

Honestly, the movie turned out to be disappointing for me, and I thought maybe it should have stayed scientific or stayed weird, not both.  It just didn't come together well for me at all.

Thanks.",1215302400,8,868,4.590909090909091
3159525,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Not the best film I've ever seen, but a damn good one and definitely worth seeing, especially if you're in the right frame of mind. The story is creepy, the atmosphere even more so, and the acting is good for an independent film. If nothing else, this movie is a refreshing change of pace from the same old hollywood ""blockbuster"" sequels,  tired ""super hero"" remakes, or yet another Will Smith retread... Just how many times can an actor play the same role in different films before audiences get bored?

Give it a shot. You may be surprised.",1215302400,32,543,4.587628865979381
3159526,5,B0016MJ6JM,"Don't let a few negative opinions dissuade you from discovering this chilling and intelligent indie gem.

If you are a fan of moody, thought-provoking thillers drenched in melancholia (very close in tone to something like John Carpenter's The Thing) then this film is for you.

If you gravitate towards the more popular, mainstream horror fare or just the gory stuff, try watching this with an open mind and hopefully expand your horizons!

A truly excellent genre film.",1214438400,36,470,5.077922077922078
3159527,1,B0016MJ6JM,"Mother earth is mad at us and now she is fighting back. And to think that she does it in such a creepy way. PU-LEEZE! It's The Shining for the tree-hugging crowd. And just like their logic on global warming, their logic in film making is flawed as well. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this clunker.

Better yet, I will help you recreate the entire movie right now in the comfort of your own home.

Step (1) Turn the air conditioner really low if it is hot outside or turn the heat off if it is cold where you are. In other words: GET THE HOUSE REALLY COLD.

Step (2) Place Al Gore's book against your chest using your right hand. If you don't have it then any of the following will work as well. Cosmo, Star Magazine, People, National Enquirer, etc.

Step (3) Flash the lights with your left hand and make howling sounds. Then cry real tears.

3159528,1,B0016MJ6JM,"The scariest thing about this ""film"" is the fact that someone OK'd the spending of hundreds of thousands (Millions?) of dollars on producing this stinking pile of dung...Wooden acting, terrible disjointed story, boring ""action"" sequences, no resolution, no connection between events...Could not give it a worse review...Ooooo--a stiff breeze, a couple of crows and phantom caribou!!  Wow!!!  I'm terrified!!  Even if it was not marketed as a thriller/horror film it still fails on levels hard to comprehend as it bores the audience to tears...One of the...No, THE worst film I have seen in a LOOOOOOOONG time...",1212364800,10,611,5.34375
3159529,5,B0016MJ6JM,"Well directed, brilliantly acted and filmed, basically it seemed to be about the earth fighting back, maybe trying to shake off the humans responsible for seemingly devastating it. Very sad in this respect, but a movie that needs to be seen, hopefully to get people thinking about their impact as a collective mass that everyone is having on this poor planet we call home, often to the detriment of all other forms of life which have suffered terribly in one way or another, and I think this is what was being shown in the film, and the spirit of the earth and it's misplaced creatures rising up conveyed this message very well, though not in such detail as to spoil the mysterious effect but in ghostly ways that were just right, not too little and not too much, but just enough to get the message home to what it was really all about. Maybe the director had a different vision to what I am interpreting from what I have seen in it, but this is how it came across to me. Also a very beautiful film to look at in it's pristine whiteness of wilderness.

PS: I am reviewing the UK DVD of the movie, (different picture on cover but I expect the movie will be the same) surprised to see it not released yet in the US. You usually get them before we do!  ;-)",1210636800,7,1253,4.305084745762712
3159530,4,B0016MJ6JM,"I had heard about this movie on a couple of my favorite movie websites and I decided to check it out when I noticed it was going to be showing at a small theater near my college campus.  I wasn't expecting much; in all honesty I was hoping it wasn't going to be so cheesy I was going to have to leave half way through.  But ""The Last Winter"" was a very, very cool little film with a couple of very eerie and creepy scenes that really come out of nowhere.  The story revolves around an oil drilling crew stationed in Alaska who experience supernatural feelings and visions before a horrendous series of grisly incidents begins to take place.  The movie has a fairly strong message about global warming and though I'm not one who worries about this because I really feel it's pushed on us so much to get political leaders elected more than anything, the movie still works.  Fissenden is the director of the horror film ""Wendigo"" and this film deals with the ancient beasts, as well as the darkness of the human psyche.  If you like bizarre horror and Ron Perlman from ""Hellboy,"" then check this little gem out!",1209600000,48,1108,4.46039603960396

3159582,5,B0016MJ6JM,"I seen this when it was first released and after watching it again recently, I like it even more. A film with a message disguised as a supernatural thriller. It's a sad commentary on America that this film basically went unnoticed. Then again, we love to ignore and/or ridicule important issues and over dramatize petty ones. Yes, we live in the land of freedumb, the land of fake and money!",1425340800,,391,4.6

3159585,1,B0016MJ6JM,"On the cover it says, ""One of the scariest movies of the year."" I beg to differ! It did not make me jump at all nor scare me one bit, at the most I was bored out of my mind! My jaw hung open in disbelief as to how much of a disappointment it was. The only ""creepy"" thing about it was when the one man was frozen in the snow who had his eyes pecked out. Would have been alot better if frozen dead bodies terrorized the crew & came out at nighttime. Kept asking myself, ""Who did this scare?!!"" I was totally lost at the end. No wonder this dvd was so cheap at FYE! If I could give it zero stars, trust me, I would! Beautiful Alaskan scenery, but horror?! It doesn't come even close to being classified as horror. I watch Halloween, Halloween 2 & Halloween H20 every year & they still scare the crap out of me! Movies like these are legendary horror because they keep you guessing, jumping, and giving you chills the whole way through! Plus the endings make sense. John Carpenter always had the best music scores to set the best eerie atmosphere of his films & the characters were always freaky!

3159587,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Excellent premise with a surprising and original story line. A thought provoking and well-done eco-thriller. Usually I like Ron Perlman as an actor, but he comes on too strong in the movie, making his character a boring and predictable stereotype. If you can overlook that, the film is worth a viewing or two. I've watched it at least eight times.",1411776000,,347,4.8

3159589,3,B0016MJ6JM,"Aside from some mediocre acting aside from the always great Ron Perlman and an at times painfully small budget; I think this film achieved what it set out to do. Which was bring out a sense of eerie desolation in which nature is in full control and plays upon man's fear and disillusion, leaving them powerless to it's unknown forces and driving them to insanity and death. The atmosphere of the film was excellent. This movie is at-least partially inspired by Algernon Blackwood's classic short story ""The Wendigo"". If you haven't read it, you should. Whatever the case, if anything I mentioned sounds interesting to you; this movie is worth watching.",1396051200,3,652,4.882882882882883
3159620,2,B0016MJ6JM,"The premise is simple - oil has been discovered in Alaska and a company was mobilized to begin drilling. `Greenies' (environmental consultants) were sent in with the crew to oversee operations and prevent any damage to mother Earth. As you may have guessed there is tension between the company manager and the lead Greenie. I won't spoil the rest of the film but it doesn't take a genius to guess these two do not see eye to eye on the best way to drill; a love interest adds another layer of stress to their working relationship and the consequences of their inability to communicate with one another affects the rest of the team. The End. Oh wait, there's some supernatural stuff that happens. The End.

The editing needed severe tightening - the film could have been way shorter and more effective, most of the actors seemed bored with their characters and the growing sense of paranoia and fear was hinted at but never fully developed. John Carpenter's classic `The Thing' successfully used more elements to set the proper tone, one of which was its haunting score.

Bottom line: The film is being promoted as a horror film which is inaccurate. At its core, it's an environmental think piece with a sloppy love triangle thrown in for tension. Watch it only of you're a hardcore Ron Perlman or Connie Britton fan or you're stuck at the inlaws. The effects were subtle and well done and I'm giving it 2 stars on its courage to be different, even if it failed miserably.",1378252800,2,1471,4.653846153846154

3159623,2,B0016MJ6JM,"I don`t mind horror or scifi movies with a message, even if I disagree with that message, if it is part of an entertaining story.  I loathe what most people consider horror movies but love genuinely chilling or even scary movies.  This one has potential to be so good, but it is all set-up and no pay-off.  The filmmakers use the laziest cheat in storytelling: If a character agrees with the filmmaker`s worldview, he is not only smart, he`s kind, heroic, better-looking than the bad guy, and a great lay, while the guy who disagrees with the director`s worldview can`t just disagree on one point, he has to be scheming, dishonest, and has to destroy evidence of wrongdoing.  If you think Al Gore has all the answers, you may enjoy this, but if you think there can be more than a black/white point of view, you`ll be in for a dull time.  Some good acting and excellent tension-building leads nowhere. Repeated shots of a well-cap in the snow promise something scary ahead, but all we get [SPOILER] is a see-through reindeer.",1350950400,5,1024,4.6353591160221
3159624,1,B0016MJ6JM,"picking up the case there's tons of reviews as well as online that describe this movie as the scariest movie of year, the most original horror ever blah, blah blah.

What you get in Ron Pearlman in remote Alaska on an oil research team trying see just how feasible oil drilling is, weighing the environmental unknowns against the corporate needs to secure energy stuff when things start to go wrong and people start dying though you get no clues as to why. This movie has the longest build up of suspense I've ever had to sit through but the music is really great, a simple haunting score and the cinematography is pretty great. Everyone's acting besides Ron Pearlman absolutely blows with one scene in particular where a man has the fakest scream since the Wilhem. Even with the great score and an absolutely perfect horror movie setting, this movie is so boring and so pointless for the first hour that all led up to an extremely unsatisfying ending. It wanted so desperately to be scary that it made it's desperation obvious which just made the whole experience even worse. Borderline unwatchable",1349395200,8,1099,4.7539267015706805
3159625,2,B0016MJ6JM,"I am truly dissapointed. I bought this movie because some lying folks said it was real scary and this is not true.

The movie is not bad definetely, if we consider the atmosphere it gives and the solid actings, however, turns out to be an ecological film with some poor graphics (the windigo????) and no scares at all!!!!

So, it's easy to see the ambience of The Thing and the sense of The Happening, at the end it looks like the zombie movies opening....",1339891200,2,456,4.416666666666667
3159626,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Saw this on HBO and had never heard of it before. I enjoyed it very much. It was good to see a semi-horror movie with character development and not just CGI effects. I found the acting to be spot on, believable and not over done. Some of the criticisms are interesting especially those who criticize the 'global warming' aspect of the movie. Since this is a movie review I won't address the global warming deniers, nature will take care of that. If you're looking for a good mood film with just the right amount of 'edge of your seat' action this is the film for you. However, if you've had your perceptions of quality twisted by endless CGI effects, blood and guts in your face horror and graphic video games this is not the movie for you.",1335139200,,740,4.408759124087592
3159627,3,B0016MJ6JM,"I just have to say if it wasn't for Ron Perlman I probably wouldn't have bought this movie!! And if he wasn't in this, I would have rated this movie a lot more lower, I don't know what it is but I just love watching him, whether its a big 'Ole Blockbuster to this Eh kind of a weird but crappy flick.

There was some parts in this movie where there some creepy stuff going on but than it would just go back down hill. It was definitely slow. The music during the creepy parts didn't seem to mix well.  What the heck were crows doing there?  Now was it because of ghosts or gas that was coming up from the ground because of global warming, was what happened? It seemed like they mingled those two together and idk it just seemed mix of ideas all jumbled up together and therefore making it unbelievable....

3159628,5,B0016MJ6JM,"My friend had me over his place when this first came out as a ""Still At The Movies On Demand Release"". He had just watched it with his girlfriend and said they didn't like it, especially with what they called the ""CGI Bullwinkle Dragon"" and said the film didn't have a conclusion. My friends are usually pretty good critics but are more typically American in their outlook on films, and like most people here, always need an ""answer"" to their Hollywood films. I'm 100% Californian, but I don't share that viewpoint, whatsoever. Life itself never concludes with any answers, only suggested ideas as we grow wiser in our outlook. I believe the best of films and music is when there is an emotional answer but not necessarily a concluded literate one, unless it's a Sherlock Holmes story or a mystery that is begging for a solved case. Listen to any Cocteau Twins song and you will know exactly what I mean by ""not needing a litereate answer"". I got to see the film because my friend ended up having to work last-minute and being a HUGE fan of ""Wendigo"", one of my favorites in the horror genre and Larry Fassenden's finest film, I was excited to see ""The Last Winter"". Although I was a bit put-off by the critique made by my friends I watched it with intent interest and their review faded away as the film embraced me with it's silent power. I thought the characters were real, and likeable, even with their faults. The cinematography was bleak but visually magnetic, and the story-line was fantastic. Eco terror is so much scarier to me than slasher films, or monsters, even though I love all those too. The music was subtle and appropriate and helped convey the sense of inevitable doom overtaking the arctic team. I completely disagree with the bad reviews here about the ending. Personally, I got a sharp jolt up my back, the hair standing on my arms, and had tears in my eyes from the overwhelming combination of despair, isolation, and awe I felt while speeding over the landscape with snow in my eyes as I experienced what the main character was seeing and feeling. I feel that this is a film critics and watchers will come back to with renewed interest. For me, a quiet masterpiece that I will be purchasing and hoping will eventually be released on blu-ray.

3159629,1,B0016MJ6JM,"RECIPE on How to Make a Movie Like THE LAST WINTER

1) Start off with some people-bereft establishing shots that are either an homage or a ripoff of Kubrick's 2001's ""The Dawn of Man"" opening sequence.
2) Pattern your setting and your pacing after Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and Kubrick's ""The Shining.""
3) In utilizing ""The Shining"" as a location and pacing template, why not use some of the music from Kubrick's film as well?  Sure - a jigger of it here and there will do nicely.
4) Toss in some of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" - especially in your final reel - showing the big black crows gaining dominion over the earth, as did Hitch in his own film.  Using the birds in such a way can be seen as homage - even though it can also be seen as motif theft...but bank on certain cinema lovers to view it as homage to the foremost Master of Suspense instead.  Homages are praised; theft usually ain't.
5) Off course, a splash of ""Blair Witch"" is now mandatory in a ""horror' film - so have one of your characters use the camcorder and have on its playback some inexplicable and swift what-was-that moment.  Yeah, that will add some flavor to the final turkey you are cooking up!
6) What would a modern movie be without CGI effects? So throw some of them in as well - even though they look ridiculous -even if they are dinosaur-sized moose or whatever - and pattern how they interact with the two male principals after the finale of ""Ghost"" wherein the good guy (late, great Patrick Swayze) is taken to Heaven while the bad-ass gets gobbled up by the shadowy, special-effects created powers of darkness.  This can be seen as a homage also, right? Sure - why not - toss it in!  Ditto!!!
7) End the whole thing with yet another ambiguous and sudden cut to black - THE END - as did, again, Hitch with his final apocalyptic vision in the masterful ""The Birds"" - because if you follow in the giant footstep of Kubrick, Hitchcock and even John Carpenter, well, maybe movie-lovers will see your own film in the light of those luminaries and think it much more than it is, right? Sure - why not - it's possible!
8) Now to stuff the turkey. Packaging and presenting your culinary/cinematic delight is also most important. One must appeal to the appetites of the hungry masses, right?  Sure! So get alot of nonsense writ on the DVD box by a bunch of critics who look like they know what they're talking about - and folks won't know if it is nonsense until they buy a theatre ticket or buy the DVD itself and then it will be too late for them...but so what?  Sure, why not? Who cares if ""The Last Winter"" is not only NOT ""The scariest movie of the year"" it was released...but it just ain't scary at all! (Alas, the hype on the used DVD grabbed this hungry-for-horror movie lover when I came across it in the horror section of my local FYE - and I, looking for brand spanking-new stuff to help celebrate the current Halloween season, shelled out my five bucks and tasted this crummy concoction thereby wasting time I could have been watching something truly ""disorienting and creepy"" as another blurbsman declares on the DVD box's back.  Why didn't they let me know that the script may have been written by Al Gore using a pen-name??? Heck, Al Gore loves horror and all - he dressed up as Frankenstein's Monster for a Halloween event when he was Vice-Prez - maybe he wrote this in a fever dream one dark, wendigo-ridden night. Who knows?)
9) Lastly - the final touch - have an alternate ending that can help pad out the DVD and make people want to buy it even moreso - and no one will know that you never really seriously intended to use this deleted ending - why would one? - it is totally absurd - now we have a dinosaur-moose morphed into a moose-man and our heroine is carried off in a swift, gotchya moment that is supposed to be a homage to every other ""horror"" movie that ever ended with a startling shock - DePalma's ""Carrie"" comes to mind - yes!  Yes - in this witch's brew recipe toss in some of DePalma, too!  Why not?  Matter-of-fact, there is even some of M. Night Shyamalan in all of this...like when the ""Signs"" alien is quick-shown on TV crashing a birthday party and Joaquin Phoenix is startled into wearing a tinfoil hat that makes him look like one of Hershey's Kisses! Yeah - M. Night - another director who has his fan-base - let's toss some of his tricks  into the mix!  But maybe not.  M. Night hasn't been doing too well at the box office.....Mmmm...Oh, what the heck - the more the merrier.
10  And now it is time to serve dinner!  Bon appetit!
Dessert anyone???  Whatever - Happy Halloween to all!!!",1318377600,3,4602,4.424852071005917
3159660,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Too many horror flicks today rely on special effects and/or sheer gore, at the cost of atmosphere, good acting and a true plot line.  This film takes you back to real shiver-up-your spine horror that builds, quietly, thoughtfully, inescapably, until you feel as trapped and doomed as the oil workers.  This is not a film that makes you jump in your seat and shriek.  This is the kind of film that draws you in, seduces you, and then leaves you shivering and thinking and shivering again for a long time.  Nothing in this movie is what you expect or anticipate.  There is no clear-cut monster or evil force or ghost or bad guy, just shades of gray, and that's part of the horror.  It contains a strong environmental overtone, but whatever your thoughts on climate change, after you watch this movie you'll never look at winter quite the same way again.",1314748800,2,851,4.602649006622516
3159661,3,B0016MJ6JM,"Set in Alaska, The Lost Winter (2006) is a suspense thriller that seems to be headed in a certain direction, only to wind up in an entirely different place, finishing in unsatisfying confusion, as what appears to be a mystery, ends up being a globally significant event.

North Industries, an oil company, has plans to begin exploration of a new section of Alaska.  The company has setup at an outpost near the proposed well site, and is attempting to work in `cooperation' with environmentalists.  After being away, North employee Ed Pollack (Ron Perlman) returns the camp, to expedite the construction of the wells.  When scientist James Hoffman (James LeGros), stands in his way, Pollack arranges for him to be transferred out.

An uneasy atmosphere grows around the camp, and becomes a critical situation when a team member who believes he has seen `ghosts' at the well, is found naked in the snow, an apparent suicide victim.  Hoffman believes that sour gas, released from the Earth due to global warming, may be responsible for the madness, and could pose a danger to them all.  Pollack doesn't buy Hoffman's theory, but his mind is clouded because his ex-lover, researcher Abby Sellers (Connie Britton), is now involved with Hoffman.  Circumstances start to degenerate around the camp, with weird behavior, death, and a disastrous accident that leaves the group with few options.  Pollack and Hoffman set out from the camp to get help, only to have some strange experiences while travelling out in the snow.

Co-written and directed by Larry Fessenden, The Last Winter is a fairly well-executed and suspenseful film, which gradually introduces supernatural elements, before taking an unconventional and weird turn that supposedly leads to Armageddon, and the `last winter'.  The film provides few solid answers, as some kind of malevolent demons are apparently the cause of the misfortunes.  Being rather odd, the film does hold your interest as you want to see where it is going, but the off the wall finish, may leave you a bit befuddled, and up in the air.  Hence, the many low ratings.  Unfortunately the commentary track by Fessenden, does little to shed any light on the film's meaning.",1309564800,3,2199,5.022038567493113

<####SPOILERS####>

The premise was a good idea...and was partially executed with spooky tension....until about the 2/3 mark...then it went down hill. The thoughts of something sinister out side and out of sight or barely visible was creepy indeed. But when it was revealed to be the ghosts of dinosaurs, it just seemed ridiculous.

No real explanation is offered. It is established that the earth is warming up at alarming rates, but how that related to ghost dinosaurs was never connected. What caused the ghosts to appear now after millions of years? Surely drilling didn't cause it...they would have appeared earlier, decades ago.

So here we have several people scared out of their minds over what they have seen and heard. This leaves the viewer thinking WOW---the reveal is just going to be fantastic! WRONG....we get odd looking CGI ghost dinosaurs that are not even scary looking. They sort of look like giant mammoth/insect/ lizards.

The end is just plain awful. The female lead wander out of a hospital I think...no explanation as to how she got there...into a puddle of water. The end.

Hardly any of the characters are appealing. And the ones who are, do not have much screen time. Maxwell, the nude snow guy, was interesting, but he wasn't in it much. The Eskimo cook was interesting, but she went on a smother rampage without and explanation. then her body disappears and no explanation for that, either. Ron Pearlman was simply dreadful with his over acting. And we learn the female lead Abby, will jump anyone's bones.

The acting was good,James LeGros was excellent in his role.
It is a movie about the horrors of global warming but in a very supernatural unrealistic way.

I didn't think it was slow, as it seems a lot of people did. I was content with the pace and tone of the movie.
There were a couple of pretty hard to watch images and scenes but not a gore fest by any means.

It's much more of a psychological/Supernatural horror flick.
AS one by one most of the people at the Arctic station started to act strange ala ""the Crazies"" except they weren't Zombie like as far as eating people ,just very weird and having no fore thought about putting themselves in hazardous or fatal situations.

There's one scene that lingered and I couldn't get it out of my head.

3159664,4,B0016MJ6JM,"I don't always need film makers to spell things out for me. Sometimes a mood will suffice. ""The Last winter"" is pretty big on mood and atmosphere. The director/producers didn't feel the need to set up a story then make a bee-line for the end and wrap it all up. They let the creep factor build and settle over things.

Here's the scoop. Big oil wants to drill up in Alaska above the Arctic Circle. An environmentalist is on hand to check the impact on the environment. The weather is unusually warm and the clock is ticking. Oil guy wants to move ahead. Environmentalist guy wants caution, but now weird things begin to happen and people begin to die.

I like this film. I like the characters and the cast is generally good. Ron Perlman, James LaGros, Kevin Corrigan and Connie Britton et al all do a fine job holding down their rolls. It's shot and cut well. The music is good as are the other areas of production. What really works here is the creepy stuff. There is an unsettling shroud over much of what happens here. Where did the crows come from? Is that a real herd of stampeding deer? Why is the gear failing and what about the sanity of the crew? Is it the sour gas or is something else afoot?

It's easy to criticize this film for the maybe too literate ending or the maybe too many references to the earth fighting back, but given the state of horror movies hitting the streets these days, this is a much more adult endeavor.

At times this movie is very Stephen King-like, with a very subtle sense of terror, just enough to give you shivers, and it slowly builds up. The music, the cinematography, the vast expanses of nothingness - all these elements and more collide in a very well-put together movie. It's not perfect, but it's oh-so-close.

3159666,1,B0016MJ6JM,"This movie has some good elements. It creates an atmosphere of isolation and impending doom, much like John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". But Carpenter's movie had much better pacing and a tighter script. It has some good actors - Connie Britton and Zach Gilford from ""Friday Night Lights"" and Ron Perlman from ""Hellboy"". But this is not their best work. Britton isn't given a lot to do, and Perlman is burdened with a ridiculously one-note character.

The first half-hour moves slowly, but there's a sense that it could get better once all the exposition is out of the way. Eventually people start acting strangely and the suspense builds. Then people start dying for some unknown reason. Characters wonder what could be the cause, and agrue about it (ad infinitum). Perlman's one-dimensional hard-ass refuses to get help. Subplots about a love triangle and an abandoned oil well are brought up and left unresolved.

- spoliers below -

There's a scene where Gilford's character wanders off naked into the snow, and rants into a camcorder. The others find his body and the camera. They watch the footage, which is very reminiscent of ""The Blair Witch Project"". It's creepy, but very unoriginal.

All of this leads up to a climax involving (I'm not kidding) a herd of ghost-moose-dinosaur creatures. It's a  laughably bad idea, rendered with bad CGI. After that, we get a final scene that's very similar to ""Resident Evil"". The final shot is of Connie Britton looking at SOMETHING, but the director doesn't bother to let us see what it is.

It all adds up to a very frustrating film. A lot of potential is wasted, and it just makes me want to watch the better movies it borrows from (""The Thing"", ""Blair Witch"", etc.). A lot of people bash this movie because of its message about global warming. But to me, that's just another opportunity that it squanders. I don't see why right-wingers are so upset. It fails to make any kind of real point, and trivializes the issue. Global warming is a real danger to human health and property.

I found the basic premise compelling, the bleak Arctic setting and cinematography quite effective, the script fairly intelligent and all the performances pretty good.  But the overall execution is boring in places (several scenes seem redundant -- how much exposition do we need to understand the basic storyline, which is actually quite simplistic?) and the last 10 minutes of the film (the ""payoff"") is muddled and predictable.  I think this film could have been much scarier and much more compelling, perhaps in the hands of another director and/or with tighter editing...

If you've ever wondered what the cast members of TV's ""Friday Night Lights"" were up to before they hit pay dirt with that wonderful series, check out ""The Last Winter,"" where you can see no fewer than two of them - Connie Britton and Zach Gilford - fighting forces of evil together in a single film.  Here they play employees of an energy firm that has sent a small team, headed by Ron Perlman, to the Arctic Circle to pump out the oil that lies beneath the newly-melting permafrost.  James LeGros is a cocky environmentalist who keeps trying to convince everyone that something ""not quite right"" is happening to the climate in the area, but none of the ""drill, baby, drill"" types seem to want to listen.  Yet, soon a mad-as-hell Mother Nature is taking matters into her own hands and, before you know it, rain is falling in February, the ice is breaking under the workers' feet, the equipment is malfunctioning, crows are circling the premises, planes are dropping out of the sky, people's noses are bleeding for no apparent reason, one man has wandered off into the wilderness stark naked, a mysterious creature is lurking around the base, and a strange form of madness has begun to settle in over the employees.

There's really not a whole lot to say about ""The Last Winter"" - which has been directed, edited and co-written by Larry Fessenden - except that this cautionary-tale about the dangers of global warming is long on exposition and short on credibility and suspense.  And, oh yes, the climax is really, really cheesy.

It's nice to see Britton and Gilford outside the confines of Dylan, Texas for a change, but this low-grade mishmash of climate-change speculation and Inuit folklore - think of it as ""The Thing"" meets ""An Inconvenient Truth"" - has precious little else to recommend it.",1264204800,,1804,4.744408945686901

3159714,3,B0016MJ6JM,"Finally saw this one last night.  The long and short of it is I can see where some love it, and where some hate it.

On the positive side, the movie does have a feel that reminds me of a combination of Session 9 and Carpenter's The Thing, as another reviewer stated.  The director using sweeping cameras on the ground and air to show the vastness of the environment and create a sense of stillness and isolation.  And it works, and feels generally unsettling.  I love Ron Perlman, and thought he and the supporting cast did well, and were convincing.

The biggest problem in my opinion was that ultimately, the movie didn't know what it wanted to be......in other words, did it want to have creatures and make that more of a focus, or did it want to be the unseen horror, that is never fully revealed.  I think maybe this film attempted to do both and that hurt it.  I would have liked it more if you were left wondering whether it was the climate, or some evil, or the minds of the characters or all of these that caused everything to transpire.....the movie was building very well....and then, as others have noted, we got that spirit creature...while I am not as down on the creature as others, it was more the fact that it was revealed at all that hurt the film, at least in my mind.

Anyway....a decent movie that could have been great.  If you're into this genre, give it a try.  While I remain on the fence, I certainly have no regrets about watching it and will probably watch it again.",1254441600,,1494,4.3768115942028984

If I want to see a good documentary on global warming, I'll watch the Discovery channel. THE LAST WINTER is a dread-inducing work of fiction, much in the same vein as SESSION 9. The one quibble I have w/ it is the use of CGI ghosts. I think the movie was doing fine without showing the critters behind the mayhem. If the spectres had been left out, this would have been a superior chiller (less is more). Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Desperation, Alien Resurrection) is always a kick to watch. He is quite an imposing figure! His Ed Pollack character is strong-willed / dedicated to the point of lunacy! He must get the job done no matter what.

There is no huge, callous revelation in the movie where we see an FX created ghoul rushing around.  I won't describe what you do see because that would be a spoiler.

Whatever your ""opinion"" on Global Warming (not sure how anyone could have a negative opinion of Gore's book, since it simply illustrates an objective reality), this is a solid indie horror flick. Larry Fessenden doesn't strike me as the future of horror on the whole as he does to some: ""Habit"" was a great take on the vampire myth, but he also wanted to make a commentary on HIV and unprotected sex. ""Wendigo"" was frightening at times but is really nothing more than a commentary on primitive myths and nature avenging the innocent.  Social commentary in horror is a time honored tradition but it needs to be a little more subtle than Fessenden does it.

""The Last Winter"" is his crowning achievement.  A North American Oil company makes the dire mistake of charting unexplored areas in an area previously protected by the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The advance team for an oil company waits for temperatures to drop so that it can start drilling in the formerly protected wildernesss preserve.

Mother nature is not cooperating, though.  The climate is uncooperative and the team, led by an arrogant and oblivious Ron Perlman, begin to experience discord within the group and the most innocent of the crew is taken early on.  Nosebleeds, insomnia, empty boots, the catalogue of madness marches on.

The message of this film is noble.  The possibility of something like this occuring when you consider the film's subject matter is not all that preposterous if you have the slightest belief in anything but science.

3159752,3,B0016MJ6JM,"The movie itself is a rather muddled, conventional indictment of humanity's desecration of the environment. We have many of the usual clichs - some individuals working on behalf of oil company interests are determined to drill in protected parts of Alaska; some supernatural rumblings are heard against this hubris; a full-bore revolt of nature takes place against the would-be drillers. The form the revolt takes in this movie is an eerie upwelling, the result of global warming.

""Last Winter"" was conceived and written before Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" made global warming an international issue. It anticipates many of Gore's arguments and assumes some of the most dire versions of the consequences he projected in his documentary. I tend to be a Green, but I had just read a book called ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming"" which cogently called into question some of these assumptions. So ""Last Winter"" struck me as being somewhat ludicrous both in its fact and its fiction.

In his Director's Commentary, Larry Fessenden himself sometimes acknowledges that he veered off into environmental clich - as when he shows the Native American in the group standing stoically, with the suggestion of a tear in his eye forming in contemplation of mankind's environmental indifference. Actually, Fessenden's objectivity and literate good sense of humor make his Commentary the best part of this DVD. He ranges far and wide in his references, telling how ""Last Winter"" is in part an homage to the horror writings of Algernon Blackwood - how it is a continuation of Fessenden's attempts to cinematically evoke the spirit of the ""Wendigo."" Fessenden also recognizes the debt he owes to others who invented the formula of his setting, his ice station isolation of a group being picked off one-by-one by some unknown horror. This standard plot framing goes back to Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians.""

So although ""Last Winter"" has a good acting turn by Ron Perlman, who for once isn't the monster, you might actually want to skip the movie itself and go straight to Fessenden's Commentary, full of interesting insights into how he achieved certain special effects, how some of the actors related to their roles and to each other, and how he was influenced by all sorts of literary antecedents. Then you might want to read/view ""An Inconvenient Truth"" on the one hand - and ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming"" on the other hand - and decide for yourself just how ludicrous or logical this film is.",1231632000,3,2530,5.062350119904076

Whatever it is, ""The Last Winter"" is a film surely provocative, certainly chilling, and possibly prophetic.

You've seen films like this before: slow but steady accumulation of suspense, the setting (ice and snow) as character, discordant, hair-on-end music to match the scene, and gradual de-stabilizing of various characters.

For the rational viewer, there are reasons for break-downs: isolation, frigid temperatures, change in love affairs, increasing concern over the vacillation of temperatures and thawing of the perma-frost. By this revelation the true nature of the story is revealed.

Escalation of bizarre deaths becomes shocking. There is an unintentional loosening in the tight binding between the rational and irrational worlds and things slip through.

It has a slow burn. It leaves a lot to the imagination..and the ending doesn't tie up things
in a little bow. If you want literal by-the-numbers ""scariness"" then DON'T check out this movie.
Don't get me wrong, I love a good slasher film myself. This movie is not that kind of horror film.

Personally, I found THE LAST WINTER to be a truly original story, with tight and restrained writing..
balanced out with great character actors and a moral that doesn't end up being  overly preachy.
I thought it was very smart. LeGros' character, Hoffman was my favorite character..and as much as I love Ron Perlman, I found his character to be the most stereotypical and ""stock""-oriented.

However, I think that the best character in the movie is the landscape and the overall
""personality"" of the scenery. The cinematography in this film is just beautiful.

Thematically and stylistically this film brings to mind John Carpenter's THE THING,
THE BIRDS by Hitchcock, and even ALIEN and SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES.
You can tell that Fessenden is a huge fan of Kubrick and Kurosawa as well. He does
A LOT with very little. That's masterful film making to me.

I really love horror flicks and I dig the entire spectrum; from B-movie splatter-fests to
atmospheric haunting psychological thrillers. THE LAST WINTER really fits into this
latter category with style, dread, and a seriously frightening message.

Part Stephen King's ""The Shining,"" part Al Gore sermon, ""The Last Winter"" is neither scary nor entertaining.  In fact, the only reason my wife and I watched it to the end was because we hoped it would get better.  But alas, it never did.

I honestly think the ""Scariest Movie of the Year"" reviews plastered accross the DVD jacket came from folks who thought the global warming message was the scary part of the movie, because the supposed ""unseen evil"" was nowhere to be found and when it did rear its head for about 7 seconds, it was laughable.

The acting was good, but you couldn't really sympathize with any of the characters.  Ron Perlman's character, who was supposed to be the heel of the film, outshined the granola-munching, environmentalist, hippy-type who was the film's the hero.  Keep in mind, however, we're talking about a very faint silver lining in a very dark cloud.  Because the film was so bad, there wasn't much chance for any type of shining.  In other word's...Perlman's character was the best of the worst.

If you want environmentalism, go buy the Al Gore movie.  If you want a scary ghost story, you're probably better off with anything other than this film!",1224374400,14,1458,4.670588235294118

3159797,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Larry Fessenden is arguably one of the most interesting directors of independent horror films in recent years. His first feature-length horror flick, NO TELLING (1991), offered a unique post-modern twist on the Frankenstein mythos, and his second, HABIT (1997), brought vampires out of the dark, brooding gothic castles of Europe and into a contemporary city suffering from ennui.  In 2001, instead of updating the monsters of traditional gothic horror, he took a more mystical approach with his film WENDIGO, which drew inspiration from a Native American myth.  It might seem a logical progression, then, that his latest effort, THE LAST WINTER, combines some of the elements of gothic horror and creatures from Native American myth into an environmental cautionary tale that takes place in the frozen tundra of Alaska.

THE LAST WINTER follows the final days of a team of scientists and technicians employed by an oil company to prep a region in the Alaskan wilderness for drilling.  As the day for the arrival of the big drilling rigs approaches, the team members slowly begin to sense that something is terribly wrong.  The weather in the region seems to have gone haywire, with wildly fluctuating temperatures and unusual precipitation that alternates between rain and snow; the permafrost seems almost oozy and may be emitting a ""sour gas"" that is dangerous to humans and animals; and the mental stability of some of the team members seems to be wearing dangerously thin, with the newest member of the team even claiming to have seen some sort of spectral phenomenon.  Some members of the team think the odd goings-on are merely natural flukes of weather, but others believe there is something more sinister at hand. Either way, could it be that nature is finally taking a stand against human tampering?

Fessenden pulls some strong performances from his actors in this film, especially the principals.  As the leader of the prep team, Ron Perlman (he of HELLBOY fame) is even more delightfully overbearing and grizzled than usual.  The beautiful Connie Britton--known to viewers from TV's SPIN CITY and, more recently, NBC's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS--does an outstanding job playing against type as a tom-boyish second-in-command, and James LeGros is very effective as a scientist who opposes Perlman's desire to forge ahead with the oil company's drilling plans.  Together with the supporting players, they generate a palpable sense of fear and despair as the team deteriorates both mentally and physically.

As in his other films, Fessenden keeps special FX to a minimum and uses the acting, character development, unusual cinematography and editing, music, and sound design to build the sense of fear in the minds of the audience.  And even when the audience is given a glimpse of the monster, Fessenden purposely leaves it unclear as to whether the monster was genuine or simply something generated in the unstable minds of the characters.  This sort of ambiguity often makes his films even scarier, because the implication is that we humans are more monstrous than anything of myth or legend.

And speaking of monsters, the creatures that are glimpsed in THE LAST WINTER look surprisingly similar to the creature in Fessenden's previous film WENDIGO, and this impression is strengthened by the fact that one of the characters, the prep team's Native American cook named Dawn, makes a brief reference to the mythical Wendigo when the first major unexplained event occurs in the film.  Though the two stories have very little in common thematically or by way of plot, the rural settings and the peripheral Native American characters of both films make it easy to speculate that Fessenden may have intended THE LAST WINTER as a subtle sequel to WENDIGO.

While not quite as interesting nor as unique as director Larry Fessenden's previous works HABIT (1997) and WENDIGO (2001), THE LAST WINTER is nonetheless a tense and frightening modern horror flick that combines some elements from gothic horror and Native American myth into a modern cautionary tale about human responsibility to the natural environment. The DVD from IFC and Genius Entertainment offers a vivid, clean digital transfer of the film at its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (anamorphic for 16x9 TVs), as well as some cool bonus features such as deleted scenes, an interview with director Fessenden, and a feature-length commentary by the director.

Thankfully, I put my fears aside and just thought about how good  Larry Fessenden's(Habit, Wendigo) other films were and gave this a shot. I was dead wrong! Sure there are some lessons to be learned, but overall this IS a horror film. A smart horror film at that. The Cinematography and score is very unsettling and the acting job from Ron Perlman is a bunch of fun. Personally it is a huge step from ""Wendigo"" an even passed by ""Habit"".

3159802,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Somewhat problematic, but I enjoyed it. Before I get into what I liked or didn't like about this film, I wanted to comment on the negative reviews. I found it ironic that so many of them seemed to direct the majority of their anger at the environmental themes found in the film, as opposed to the camera work, storytelling, and acting.

It's a work of fantasy, people. If you don't happen to subscribe to current global-warming theories, this movie isn't attempting to change your mind. I mean, tying global warming to vengeful supernatural entities that may or may not exist outside of the minds of the protagonists? Do any of these reviewers really think Larry Fessenden is trying to suggest that this is what's really going on with the environment?

It struck me more as a ""what if"" film. If I watch a film about a young girl possessed by demonic entities, I don't base my enjoyment of it on whether or not I believe in god, the devil, or the minions of either.

I can enjoy The Exorcist, whether or not I believe that the events it depicts could happen in real life..

(puts soapbox away)

The Last Winter is slow, but very atmospheric. Comparisons to the John Carpenter version of The Thing are pretty apt, with regards to setting and tone, although The Last Winter is far less bleak and paranoid, and the characters are more appealing.

It certainly takes its time developing and the effects are modest, but fairly effective. Or maybe I just have a soft-spot in my heart for daemonic elk? Some very nice performances, as well, although Ron Pearlman's character is perhaps a bit overdone. The swooping camera movement that mimics the viewpoint of the crows (ravens?) that appear in the film as they fly over the survey camp was a very nice touch.

It's an eerie film, one that stayed with me for days afterward. And beautiful, as well. Maybe a horror film for those with a ""photographic sensibility""? Certainly not a film for those who only like their horror dumb and bloody. You do have to participate a bit in this one, and I always feel like that helps keep me involved.",1218585600,19,2078,4.6

After finally finding wide release I was excited to see what was touted by many to be a very good horror movie.
I should have known better though after the disappointment that was Fessenden's Wendigo.
The Last Winter is the story of oil drillers looking to exploit the massive reserves of crude buried beneath the Alaskan wilderness. Slowly each one of the characters begins to fall victim to a mysterious and contagious madness as the ice begins to melt unleasing ""ghost caribou,"" I'm not making that up, CGI ghost caribou.
Anyway, while the movie may or may not intentionally espouse the misguided and cultish poli-pseudo-science that is global warming, the story and scares suck either way.
I was wholey disappointed by this movie which played something like a cross between an arthouse snoozer and a sci-fi channel original movie.
I will give The Last Winter this, however, it's refreshing to see James LeGros back at work and the storyline, while stupid and unfrightening, is at least original and an interesting concept which I imagine served as the basis for M. Knight Shamalamadingdong's most recent rip off, The Happening.
Bottomline, unless you're a fan of pretenious garbage that feigns intellectual depth and or the atrocious cinema the Sci-fi channel pumps out each year, you aren't going to like The Last Winter.",1215993600,11,1484,4.94

I'm not going to politicize the film like some others, although the elements of global warming alarmists and anti-drilling activists are easily deciphered. These things were used as a backdrop, not a statement. Ultimately this was intended to be a horror movie, but it fell completely flat.

For a genuinely great horror film about people isolated in a frozen wasteland confronting an ancient evil, watch The Thing. This film should be buried under the ice and forgotten as quickly as possible.",1215993600,10,772,5.119047619047619

There was the normal scientific talk, you know, global warming, figures and numbers, important meetings at the top of the world to discuss America becoming oil independepent....but then all of a sudden it got very unscientific and changed to weird.

I was wondering what in the world the boy was seeing, and eventually my question was asked. And then when I got to the ending, I was like...huh, I know they weren't finished..but they were.  Maybe, the movie makers were trying to rush to get finished before a set time or something.

Honestly, the movie turned out to be disappointing for me, and I thought maybe it should have stayed scientific or stayed weird, not both.  It just didn't come together well for me at all.

As you may have guessed there is tension between the company manager and the lead Greenie. I won't spoil the rest of the film but it doesn't take a genius to guess these two do not see eye to eye on the best way to drill; a love interest adds another layer of stress to their working relationship and the consequences of their inability to communicate with one another affects the rest of the team. The End. Oh wait, there's some supernatural stuff that happens. The End.

The editing needed severe tightening - the film could have been way shorter and more effective, most of the actors seemed bored with their characters and the growing sense of paranoia and fear was hinted at but never fully developed. John Carpenter's classic `The Thing' successfully used more elements to set the proper tone, one of which was its haunting score.

Bottom line: The film is being promoted as a horror film which is inaccurate. At its core, it's an environmental think piece with a sloppy love triangle thrown in for tension.

However, if you've had your perceptions of quality twisted by endless CGI effects, blood and guts in your face horror and graphic video games this is not the movie for you.",1335139200,,740,4.408759124087592
3394124,3,B0016MJ6JM,"I just have to say if it wasn't for Ron Perlman I probably wouldn't have bought this movie!! And if he wasn't in this, I would have rated this movie a lot more lower, I don't know what it is but I just love watching him, whether its a big 'Ole Blockbuster to this Eh kind of a weird but crappy flick.

There was some parts in this movie where there some creepy stuff going on but than it would just go back down hill. It was definitely slow. The music during the creepy parts didn't seem to mix well.  What the heck were crows doing there?  Now was it because of ghosts or gas that was coming up from the ground because of global warming, was what happened? It seemed like they mingled those two together and idk it just seemed mix of ideas all jumbled up together and therefore making it unbelievable....

Conclusion: Rent it if you are bored or just curious...buy it if you are really daring or just a big movie freak or in my case a ron perlman freak....or don't watch it......you pick....",1321574400,,992,4.26063829787234
3394125,5,B0016MJ6JM,"My friend had me over his place when this first came out as a ""Still At The Movies On Demand Release"". He had just watched it with his girlfriend and said they didn't like it, especially with what they called the ""CGI Bullwinkle Dragon"" and said the film didn't have a conclusion. My friends are usually pretty good critics but are more typically American in their outlook on films, and like most people here, always need an ""answer"" to their Hollywood films. I'm 100% Californian, but I don't share that viewpoint, whatsoever. Life itself never concludes with any answers, only suggested ideas as we grow wiser in our outlook. I believe the best of films and music is when there is an emotional answer but not necessarily a concluded literate one, unless it's a Sherlock Holmes story or a mystery that is begging for a solved case. Listen to any Cocteau Twins song and you will know exactly what I mean by ""not needing a litereate answer"". I got to see the film because my friend ended up having to work last-minute and being a HUGE fan of ""Wendigo"", one of my favorites in the horror genre and Larry Fassenden's finest film, I was excited to see ""The Last Winter"". Although I was a bit put-off by the critique made by my friends I watched it with intent interest and their review faded away as the film embraced me with it's silent power. I thought the characters were real, and likeable, even with their faults. The cinematography was bleak but visually magnetic, and the story-line was fantastic. Eco terror is so much scarier to me than slasher films, or monsters, even though I love all those too. The music was subtle and appropriate and helped convey the sense of inevitable doom overtaking the arctic team. I completely disagree with the bad reviews here about the ending. Personally, I got a sharp jolt up my back, the hair standing on my arms, and had tears in my eyes from the overwhelming combination of despair, isolation, and awe I felt while speeding over the landscape with snow in my eyes as I experienced what the main character was seeing and feeling. I feel that this is a film critics and watchers will come back to with renewed interest. For me, a quiet masterpiece that I will be purchasing and hoping will eventually be released on blu-ray. Recommended for the less Hollywood type.",1321574400,2,2306,4.626829268292683
3394126,1,B0016MJ6JM,"RECIPE on How to Make a Movie Like THE LAST WINTER

1) Start off with some people-bereft establishing shots that are either an homage or a ripoff of Kubrick's 2001's ""The Dawn of Man"" opening sequence.
2) Pattern your setting and your pacing after Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and Kubrick's ""The Shining.""
3) In utilizing ""The Shining"" as a location and pacing template, why not use some of the music from Kubrick's film as well?  Sure - a jigger of it here and there will do nicely.
4) Toss in some of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" - especially in your final reel - showing the big black crows gaining dominion over the earth, as did Hitch in his own film.  Using the birds in such a way can be seen as homage - even though it can also be seen as motif theft...but bank on certain cinema lovers to view it as homage to the foremost Master of Suspense instead.  Homages are praised; theft usually ain't.
5) Off course, a splash of ""Blair Witch"" is now mandatory in a ""horror' film - so have one of your characters use the camcorder and have on its playback some inexplicable and swift what-was-that moment.  Yeah, that will add some flavor to the final turkey you are cooking up!
6) What would a modern movie be without CGI effects? So throw some of them in as well - even though they look ridiculous -even if they are dinosaur-sized moose or whatever - and pattern how they interact with the two male principals after the finale of ""Ghost"" wherein the good guy (late, great Patrick Swayze) is taken to Heaven while the bad-ass gets gobbled up by the shadowy, special-effects created powers of darkness.  This can be seen as a homage also, right? Sure - why not - toss it in!  Ditto!!!
7) End the whole thing with yet another ambiguous and sudden cut to black - THE END - as did, again, Hitch with his final apocalyptic vision in the masterful ""The Birds"" - because if you follow in the giant footstep of Kubrick, Hitchcock and even John Carpenter, well, maybe movie-lovers will see your own film in the light of those luminaries and think it much more than it is, right? Sure - why not - it's possible!
8) Now to stuff the turkey. Packaging and presenting your culinary/cinematic delight is also most important. One must appeal to the appetites of the hungry masses, right?  Sure! So get alot of nonsense writ on the DVD box by a bunch of critics who look like they know what they're talking about - and folks won't know if it is nonsense until they buy a theatre ticket or buy the DVD itself and then it will be too late for them...but so what?  Sure, why not? Who cares if ""The Last Winter"" is not only NOT ""The scariest movie of the year"" it was released...but it just ain't scary at all! (Alas, the hype on the used DVD grabbed this hungry-for-horror movie lover when I came across it in the horror section of my local FYE - and I, looking for brand spanking-new stuff to help celebrate the current Halloween season, shelled out my five bucks and tasted this crummy concoction thereby wasting time I could have been watching something truly ""disorienting and creepy"" as another blurbsman declares on the DVD box's back.  Why didn't they let me know that the script may have been written by Al Gore using a pen-name??? Heck, Al Gore loves horror and all - he dressed up as Frankenstein's Monster for a Halloween event when he was Vice-Prez - maybe he wrote this in a fever dream one dark, wendigo-ridden night. Who knows?)
9) Lastly - the final touch - have an alternate ending that can help pad out the DVD and make people want to buy it even moreso - and no one will know that you never really seriously intended to use this deleted ending - why would one? - it is totally absurd - now we have a dinosaur-moose morphed into a moose-man and our heroine is carried off in a swift, gotchya moment that is supposed to be a homage to every other ""horror"" movie that ever ended with a startling shock - DePalma's ""Carrie"" comes to mind - yes!  Yes - in this witch's brew recipe toss in some of DePalma, too!  Why not?  Matter-of-fact, there is even some of M. Night Shyamalan in all of this...like when the ""Signs"" alien is quick-shown on TV crashing a birthday party and Joaquin Phoenix is startled into wearing a tinfoil hat that makes him look like one of Hershey's Kisses! Yeah - M. Night - another director who has his fan-base - let's toss some of his tricks  into the mix!  But maybe not.  M. Night hasn't been doing too well at the box office.....Mmmm...Oh, what the heck - the more the merrier.
10  And now it is time to serve dinner!  Bon appetit!
Dessert anyone???  Whatever - Happy Halloween to all!!!",1318377600,3,4602,4.424852071005917
3394157,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Too many horror flicks today rely on special effects and/or sheer gore, at the cost of atmosphere, good acting and a true plot line.  This film takes you back to real shiver-up-your spine horror that builds, quietly, thoughtfully, inescapably, until you feel as trapped and doomed as the oil workers.  This is not a film that makes you jump in your seat and shriek.  This is the kind of film that draws you in, seduces you, and then leaves you shivering and thinking and shivering again for a long time.  Nothing in this movie is what you expect or anticipate.  There is no clear-cut monster or evil force or ghost or bad guy, just shades of gray, and that's part of the horror.  It contains a strong environmental overtone, but whatever your thoughts on climate change, after you watch this movie you'll never look at winter quite the same way again.",1314748800,2,851,4.602649006622516
3394158,3,B0016MJ6JM,"Set in Alaska, The Lost Winter (2006) is a suspense thriller that seems to be headed in a certain direction, only to wind up in an entirely different place, finishing in unsatisfying confusion, as what appears to be a mystery, ends up being a globally significant event.

North Industries, an oil company, has plans to begin exploration of a new section of Alaska.  The company has setup at an outpost near the proposed well site, and is attempting to work in `cooperation' with environmentalists.  After being away, North employee Ed Pollack (Ron Perlman) returns the camp, to expedite the construction of the wells.  When scientist James Hoffman (James LeGros), stands in his way, Pollack arranges for him to be transferred out.

An uneasy atmosphere grows around the camp, and becomes a critical situation when a team member who believes he has seen `ghosts' at the well, is found naked in the snow, an apparent suicide victim.  Hoffman believes that sour gas, released from the Earth due to global warming, may be responsible for the madness, and could pose a danger to them all.  Pollack doesn't buy Hoffman's theory, but his mind is clouded because his ex-lover, researcher Abby Sellers (Connie Britton), is now involved with Hoffman.  Circumstances start to degenerate around the camp, with weird behavior, death, and a disastrous accident that leaves the group with few options.  Pollack and Hoffman set out from the camp to get help, only to have some strange experiences while travelling out in the snow.

Co-written and directed by Larry Fessenden, The Last Winter is a fairly well-executed and suspenseful film, which gradually introduces supernatural elements, before taking an unconventional and weird turn that supposedly leads to Armageddon, and the `last winter'.  The film provides few solid answers, as some kind of malevolent demons are apparently the cause of the misfortunes.  Being rather odd, the film does hold your interest as you want to see where it is going, but the off the wall finish, may leave you a bit befuddled, and up in the air.  Hence, the many low ratings.  Unfortunately the commentary track by Fessenden, does little to shed any light on the film's meaning.",1309564800,3,2199,5.022038567493113
3394159,1,B0016MJ6JM,"Although it APPEARED like this was going to be a good film, it was saddled with forgivable problems until the last scene and then I realized i could have been watching something better.

<####SPOILERS####>

The premise was a good idea...and was partially executed with spooky tension....until about the 2/3 mark...then it went down hill. The thoughts of something sinister out side and out of sight or barely visible was creepy indeed. But when it was revealed to be the ghosts of dinosaurs, it just seemed ridiculous.

No real explanation is offered. It is established that the earth is warming up at alarming rates, but how that related to ghost dinosaurs was never connected. What caused the ghosts to appear now after millions of years? Surely drilling didn't cause it...they would have appeared earlier, decades ago.

So here we have several people scared out of their minds over what they have seen and heard. This leaves the viewer thinking WOW---the reveal is just going to be fantastic! WRONG....we get odd looking CGI ghost dinosaurs that are not even scary looking. They sort of look like giant mammoth/insect/ lizards.

The end is just plain awful. The female lead wander out of a hospital I think...no explanation as to how she got there...into a puddle of water. The end.

Hardly any of the characters are appealing. And the ones who are, do not have much screen time. Maxwell, the nude snow guy, was interesting, but he wasn't in it much. The Eskimo cook was interesting, but she went on a smother rampage without and explanation. then her body disappears and no explanation for that, either. Ron Pearlman was simply dreadful with his over acting. And we learn the female lead Abby, will jump anyone's bones.

The cover says it's ""the scariest movie of the year!""  They lied.",1309132800,3,1790,4.865131578947368
3394160,4,B0016MJ6JM,"This movie was not what I expected but in a good way.
The acting was good,James LeGros was excellent in his role.
It is a movie about the horrors of global warming but in a very supernatural unrealistic way.

I didn't think it was slow, as it seems a lot of people did. I was content with the pace and tone of the movie.
There were a couple of pretty hard to watch images and scenes but not a gore fest by any means.

It's much more of a psychological/Supernatural horror flick.
AS one by one most of the people at the Arctic station started to act strange ala ""the Crazies"" except they weren't Zombie like as far as eating people ,just very weird and having no fore thought about putting themselves in hazardous or fatal situations.

There's one scene that lingered and I couldn't get it out of my head. I wondered if it was due to the artistic aspect and design of the scene or post dramatic couldn't get it out of my head syndrome.. All in all it's interesting all the way through and was quite original in most aspects.",1306627200,2,1023,4.290155440414508
3394161,4,B0016MJ6JM,"I don't always need film makers to spell things out for me. Sometimes a mood will suffice. ""The Last winter"" is pretty big on mood and atmosphere. The director/producers didn't feel the need to set up a story then make a bee-line for the end and wrap it all up. They let the creep factor build and settle over things.

Here's the scoop. Big oil wants to drill up in Alaska above the Arctic Circle. An environmentalist is on hand to check the impact on the environment. The weather is unusually warm and the clock is ticking. Oil guy wants to move ahead. Environmentalist guy wants caution, but now weird things begin to happen and people begin to die.

I like this film. I like the characters and the cast is generally good. Ron Perlman, James LaGros, Kevin Corrigan and Connie Britton et al all do a fine job holding down their rolls. It's shot and cut well. The music is good as are the other areas of production. What really works here is the creepy stuff. There is an unsettling shroud over much of what happens here. Where did the crows come from? Is that a real herd of stampeding deer? Why is the gear failing and what about the sanity of the crew? Is it the sour gas or is something else afoot?

It's easy to criticize this film for the maybe too literate ending or the maybe too many references to the earth fighting back, but given the state of horror movies hitting the streets these days, this is a much more adult endeavor. I would rather sit through one of this type of film than ten of the others.",1300320000,3,1512,4.3356890459363955

I loved the eco-slant and the horror elements in this film, but at times just the uncertainty of the weather conditions are creepy enough to scare you. At times this movie is very Stephen King-like, with a very subtle sense of terror, just enough to give you shivers, and it slowly builds up. The music, the cinematography, the vast expanses of nothingness - all these elements and more collide in a very well-put together movie. It's not perfect, but it's oh-so-close. If you like eco-themed movies, enjoy horror or supernatural thrillers, or winter/arctic location films, give this one a try.",1293926400,6,760,4.595588235294118
3394163,1,B0016MJ6JM,"This movie has some good elements. It creates an atmosphere of isolation and impending doom, much like John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". But Carpenter's movie had much better pacing and a tighter script. It has some good actors - Connie Britton and Zach Gilford from ""Friday Night Lights"" and Ron Perlman from ""Hellboy"". But this is not their best work. Britton isn't given a lot to do, and Perlman is burdened with a ridiculously one-note character.

The first half-hour moves slowly, but there's a sense that it could get better once all the exposition is out of the way. Eventually people start acting strangely and the suspense builds. Then people start dying for some unknown reason. Characters wonder what could be the cause, and agrue about it (ad infinitum). Perlman's one-dimensional hard-ass refuses to get help. Subplots about a love triangle and an abandoned oil well are brought up and left unresolved.

- spoliers below -

There's a scene where Gilford's character wanders off naked into the snow, and rants into a camcorder. The others find his body and the camera. They watch the footage, which is very reminiscent of ""The Blair Witch Project"". It's creepy, but very unoriginal.

All of this leads up to a climax involving (I'm not kidding) a herd of ghost-moose-dinosaur creatures. It's a  laughably bad idea, rendered with bad CGI. After that, we get a final scene that's very similar to ""Resident Evil"". The final shot is of Connie Britton looking at SOMETHING, but the director doesn't bother to let us see what it is.

It all adds up to a very frustrating film. A lot of potential is wasted, and it just makes me want to watch the better movies it borrows from (""The Thing"", ""Blair Witch"", etc.). A lot of people bash this movie because of its message about global warming. But to me, that's just another opportunity that it squanders. I don't see why right-wingers are so upset. It fails to make any kind of real point, and trivializes the issue. Global warming is a real danger to human health and property. We don't need ghost-moose-dinosaurs to be afraid of.",1293667200,5,2079,4.809523809523809

OR they saw it is an overlong snoozer, with no real elements of traditional horror and a heavy-handed take on the climate change debate.  I guess I come down somewhere in the middle.  I found the basic premise compelling, the bleak Arctic setting and cinematography quite effective, the script fairly intelligent and all the performances pretty good.  But the overall execution is boring in places (several scenes seem redundant -- how much exposition do we need to understand the basic storyline, which is actually quite simplistic?) and the last 10 minutes of the film (the ""payoff"") is muddled and predictable.  I think this film could have been much scarier and much more compelling, perhaps in the hands of another director and/or with tighter editing... BUT if you're looking for a thoughtful psychological thriller with an environmental theme, this is actually a good film overall.  Save it for a cold winter's night with the wind howling outside, while you sip on a hot cider (laced with rum!) with your girlfriend or significant other.",1286064000,3,1148,5.150537634408602

The reason for my low rating it that I felt this story was too long and it has an unfulfilling ending although it stays with you, I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It leaves way too much to ones interpretation.

The cast is OK, but you care little for most of these people and there are a lot of things that don't make much sense.

If you've ever wondered what the cast members of TV's ""Friday Night Lights"" were up to before they hit pay dirt with that wonderful series, check out ""The Last Winter,"" where you can see no fewer than two of them - Connie Britton and Zach Gilford - fighting forces of evil together in a single film.  Here they play employees of an energy firm that has sent a small team, headed by Ron Perlman, to the Arctic Circle to pump out the oil that lies beneath the newly-melting permafrost.  James LeGros is a cocky environmentalist who keeps trying to convince everyone that something ""not quite right"" is happening to the climate in the area, but none of the ""drill, baby, drill"" types seem to want to listen.  Yet, soon a mad-as-hell Mother Nature is taking matters into her own hands and, before you know it, rain is falling in February, the ice is breaking under the workers' feet, the equipment is malfunctioning, crows are circling the premises, planes are dropping out of the sky, people's noses are bleeding for no apparent reason, one man has wandered off into the wilderness stark naked, a mysterious creature is lurking around the base, and a strange form of madness has begun to settle in over the employees.

There's really not a whole lot to say about ""The Last Winter"" - which has been directed, edited and co-written by Larry Fessenden - except that this cautionary-tale about the dangers of global warming is long on exposition and short on credibility and suspense.  And, oh yes, the climax is really, really cheesy.

It's nice to see Britton and Gilford outside the confines of Dylan, Texas for a change, but this low-grade mishmash of climate-change speculation and Inuit folklore - think of it as ""The Thing"" meets ""An Inconvenient Truth"" - has precious little else to recommend it.",1264204800,,1804,4.744408945686901

3394211,3,B0016MJ6JM,"Finally saw this one last night.  The long and short of it is I can see where some love it, and where some hate it.

On the positive side, the movie does have a feel that reminds me of a combination of Session 9 and Carpenter's The Thing, as another reviewer stated.  The director using sweeping cameras on the ground and air to show the vastness of the environment and create a sense of stillness and isolation.  And it works, and feels generally unsettling.  I love Ron Perlman, and thought he and the supporting cast did well, and were convincing.

The biggest problem in my opinion was that ultimately, the movie didn't know what it wanted to be......in other words, did it want to have creatures and make that more of a focus, or did it want to be the unseen horror, that is never fully revealed.  I think maybe this film attempted to do both and that hurt it.  I would have liked it more if you were left wondering whether it was the climate, or some evil, or the minds of the characters or all of these that caused everything to transpire.....the movie was building very well....and then, as others have noted, we got that spirit creature...while I am not as down on the creature as others, it was more the fact that it was revealed at all that hurt the film, at least in my mind.

Anyway....a decent movie that could have been great.  If you're into this genre, give it a try.  While I remain on the fence, I certainly have no regrets about watching it and will probably watch it again.",1254441600,,1494,4.3768115942028984

Is it rather preachy at times? Sure. However, I just watched it as a well-told horror story, without worrying about the ""message"". If I want to see a good documentary on global warming, I'll watch the Discovery channel. THE LAST WINTER is a dread-inducing work of fiction, much in the same vein as SESSION 9. The one quibble I have w/ it is the use of CGI ghosts. I think the movie was doing fine without showing the critters behind the mayhem. If the spectres had been left out, this would have been a superior chiller (less is more). Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Desperation, Alien Resurrection) is always a kick to watch. He is quite an imposing figure! His Ed Pollack character is strong-willed / dedicated to the point of lunacy! He must get the job done no matter what.

3394215,4,B0016MJ6JM,"First of all, there seems to be a misconception of this movie among some reviewers that will put quite a few fans of subtle horror off: there are no monsters in this movie.  There is no huge, callous revelation in the movie where we see an FX created ghoul rushing around.  I won't describe what you do see because that would be a spoiler.

Whatever your ""opinion"" on Global Warming (not sure how anyone could have a negative opinion of Gore's book, since it simply illustrates an objective reality), this is a solid indie horror flick. Larry Fessenden doesn't strike me as the future of horror on the whole as he does to some: ""Habit"" was a great take on the vampire myth, but he also wanted to make a commentary on HIV and unprotected sex. ""Wendigo"" was frightening at times but is really nothing more than a commentary on primitive myths and nature avenging the innocent.  Social commentary in horror is a time honored tradition but it needs to be a little more subtle than Fessenden does it.

""The Last Winter"" is his crowning achievement.  A North American Oil company makes the dire mistake of charting unexplored areas in an area previously protected by the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The advance team for an oil company waits for temperatures to drop so that it can start drilling in the formerly protected wildernesss preserve.

Mother nature is not cooperating, though.

3394249,3,B0016MJ6JM,"The movie itself is a rather muddled, conventional indictment of humanity's desecration of the environment. We have many of the usual clichs - some individuals working on behalf of oil company interests are determined to drill in protected parts of Alaska; some supernatural rumblings are heard against this hubris; a full-bore revolt of nature takes place against the would-be drillers. The form the revolt takes in this movie is an eerie upwelling, the result of global warming.

""Last Winter"" was conceived and written before Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" made global warming an international issue. It anticipates many of Gore's arguments and assumes some of the most dire versions of the consequences he projected in his documentary. I tend to be a Green, but I had just read a book called ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming"" which cogently called into question some of these assumptions. So ""Last Winter"" struck me as being somewhat ludicrous both in its fact and its fiction.

In his Director's Commentary, Larry Fessenden himself sometimes acknowledges that he veered off into environmental clich - as when he shows the Native American in the group standing stoically, with the suggestion of a tear in his eye forming in contemplation of mankind's environmental indifference. Actually, Fessenden's objectivity and literate good sense of humor make his Commentary the best part of this DVD. He ranges far and wide in his references, telling how ""Last Winter"" is in part an homage to the horror writings of Algernon Blackwood - how it is a continuation of Fessenden's attempts to cinematically evoke the spirit of the ""Wendigo."" Fessenden also recognizes the debt he owes to others who invented the formula of his setting, his ice station isolation of a group being picked off one-by-one by some unknown horror. This standard plot framing goes back to Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians.""

So although ""Last Winter"" has a good acting turn by Ron Perlman, who for once isn't the monster, you might actually want to skip the movie itself and go straight to Fessenden's Commentary, full of interesting insights into how he achieved certain special effects, how some of the actors related to their roles and to each other, and how he was influenced by all sorts of literary antecedents. Then you might want to read/view ""An Inconvenient Truth"" on the one hand - and ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming"" on the other hand - and decide for yourself just how ludicrous or logical this film is.",1231632000,3,2530,5.062350119904076
3394250,4,B0016MJ6JM,"""The Last Winter""-- in reference to what? A couple's last time together? A specific time period for the end of anything? Or literally, the last winter on Earth? Filmed in Alaska and Iceland, ""The Last Winter"" is a psychological thriller based on the supernatural. Maybe not. Maybe it's a political documentary posed in supernatural trappings. Whatever it is, ""The Last Winter"" is a film surely provocative, certainly chilling, and possibly prophetic.

You've seen films like this before: slow but steady accumulation of suspense, the setting (ice and snow) as character, discordant, hair-on-end music to match the scene, and gradual de-stabilizing of various characters.

For the rational viewer, there are reasons for break-downs: isolation, frigid temperatures, change in love affairs, increasing concern over the vacillation of temperatures and thawing of the perma-frost. By this revelation the true nature of the story is revealed.

Escalation of bizarre deaths becomes shocking. There is an unintentional loosening in the tight binding between the rational and irrational worlds and things slip through.

There is a powerful message in this indie film with multiple levels of truth, each chilling in its own level. A must-see film for the thoughtful person concerned with the eco-environment.",1231545600,5,1298,5.540404040404041

Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman, James LeGros, Connie Britton, and Kevin Corrigan among others star as members of a drilling operation in the Arctic, and soon enough, strange and ultra-creepy things start to happen, and that's just the beginning.  What The Last Winter lacks in plot it more than makes up for in atmosphere.  Fessenden has managed to weave an ultra-gloomy atmosphere and enough creepy moments to keep you glued to the screen during its entire running time.  The cast as a whole does pretty well, and the film's message gives the viewer enough food for thought as well.  All in all, The Last Winter is definitely not meant for all horror tastes, but it is worthy of being given a shot in the very least regardless.",1230249600,3,946,4.850931677018633

Ron Perlman plays a hard nosed oil representative who won't allow anyone to leave despite the strange happenings, and deaths.

3394253,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Truth be told, I can understand why someone WOULDN'T like this film.

It has a slow burn. It leaves a lot to the imagination..and the ending doesn't tie up things
in a little bow. If you want literal by-the-numbers ""scariness"" then DON'T check out this movie.
Don't get me wrong, I love a good slasher film myself. This movie is not that kind of horror film.

Personally, I found THE LAST WINTER to be a truly original story, with tight and restrained writing..
balanced out with great character actors and a moral that doesn't end up being  overly preachy.
I thought it was very smart. LeGros' character, Hoffman was my favorite character..and as much as I love Ron Perlman, I found his character to be the most stereotypical and ""stock""-oriented.

However, I think that the best character in the movie is the landscape and the overall
""personality"" of the scenery. The cinematography in this film is just beautiful.

Thematically and stylistically this film brings to mind John Carpenter's THE THING,
THE BIRDS by Hitchcock, and even ALIEN and SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES.
You can tell that Fessenden is a huge fan of Kubrick and Kurosawa as well. He does
A LOT with very little. That's masterful film making to me.

I really love horror flicks and I dig the entire spectrum; from B-movie splatter-fests to
atmospheric haunting psychological thrillers. THE LAST WINTER really fits into this
latter category with style, dread, and a seriously frightening message.

I liked this film quite a bit...I watched twice back to back and found some
beautifully subtle characterizations and gems of scriptwriting that you won't find in a first viewing.

Again, I understand why someone wouldn't dig it.

Part Stephen King's ""The Shining,"" part Al Gore sermon, ""The Last Winter"" is neither scary nor entertaining.  In fact, the only reason my wife and I watched it to the end was because we hoped it would get better.  But alas, it never did.

I honestly think the ""Scariest Movie of the Year"" reviews plastered accross the DVD jacket came from folks who thought the global warming message was the scary part of the movie, because the supposed ""unseen evil"" was nowhere to be found and when it did rear its head for about 7 seconds, it was laughable.

The acting was good, but you couldn't really sympathize with any of the characters.  Ron Perlman's character, who was supposed to be the heel of the film, outshined the granola-munching, environmentalist, hippy-type who was the film's the hero.

3394294,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Larry Fessenden is arguably one of the most interesting directors of independent horror films in recent years. His first feature-length horror flick, NO TELLING (1991), offered a unique post-modern twist on the Frankenstein mythos, and his second, HABIT (1997), brought vampires out of the dark, brooding gothic castles of Europe and into a contemporary city suffering from ennui.  In 2001, instead of updating the monsters of traditional gothic horror, he took a more mystical approach with his film WENDIGO, which drew inspiration from a Native American myth.  It might seem a logical progression, then, that his latest effort, THE LAST WINTER, combines some of the elements of gothic horror and creatures from Native American myth into an environmental cautionary tale that takes place in the frozen tundra of Alaska.

THE LAST WINTER follows the final days of a team of scientists and technicians employed by an oil company to prep a region in the Alaskan wilderness for drilling.  As the day for the arrival of the big drilling rigs approaches, the team members slowly begin to sense that something is terribly wrong.  The weather in the region seems to have gone haywire, with wildly fluctuating temperatures and unusual precipitation that alternates between rain and snow; the permafrost seems almost oozy and may be emitting a ""sour gas"" that is dangerous to humans and animals; and the mental stability of some of the team members seems to be wearing dangerously thin, with the newest member of the team even claiming to have seen some sort of spectral phenomenon.  Some members of the team think the odd goings-on are merely natural flukes of weather, but others believe there is something more sinister at hand. Either way, could it be that nature is finally taking a stand against human tampering?

Fessenden pulls some strong performances from his actors in this film, especially the principals.  As the leader of the prep team, Ron Perlman (he of HELLBOY fame) is even more delightfully overbearing and grizzled than usual.  The beautiful Connie Britton--known to viewers from TV's SPIN CITY and, more recently, NBC's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS--does an outstanding job playing against type as a tom-boyish second-in-command, and James LeGros is very effective as a scientist who opposes Perlman's desire to forge ahead with the oil company's drilling plans.  Together with the supporting players, they generate a palpable sense of fear and despair as the team deteriorates both mentally and physically.

As in his other films, Fessenden keeps special FX to a minimum and uses the acting, character development, unusual cinematography and editing, music, and sound design to build the sense of fear in the minds of the audience.  And even when the audience is given a glimpse of the monster, Fessenden purposely leaves it unclear as to whether the monster was genuine or simply something generated in the unstable minds of the characters.  This sort of ambiguity often makes his films even scarier, because the implication is that we humans are more monstrous than anything of myth or legend.

And speaking of monsters, the creatures that are glimpsed in THE LAST WINTER look surprisingly similar to the creature in Fessenden's previous film WENDIGO, and this impression is strengthened by the fact that one of the characters, the prep team's Native American cook named Dawn, makes a brief reference to the mythical Wendigo when the first major unexplained event occurs in the film.  Though the two stories have very little in common thematically or by way of plot, the rural settings and the peripheral Native American characters of both films make it easy to speculate that Fessenden may have intended THE LAST WINTER as a subtle sequel to WENDIGO.

While not quite as interesting nor as unique as director Larry Fessenden's previous works HABIT (1997) and WENDIGO (2001), THE LAST WINTER is nonetheless a tense and frightening modern horror flick that combines some elements from gothic horror and Native American myth into a modern cautionary tale about human responsibility to the natural environment. The DVD from IFC and Genius Entertainment offers a vivid, clean digital transfer of the film at its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (anamorphic for 16x9 TVs), as well as some cool bonus features such as deleted scenes, an interview with director Fessenden, and a feature-length commentary by the director.

3394299,4,B0016MJ6JM,"Somewhat problematic, but I enjoyed it. Before I get into what I liked or didn't like about this film, I wanted to comment on the negative reviews. I found it ironic that so many of them seemed to direct the majority of their anger at the environmental themes found in the film, as opposed to the camera work, storytelling, and acting.

It's a work of fantasy, people. If you don't happen to subscribe to current global-warming theories, this movie isn't attempting to change your mind. I mean, tying global warming to vengeful supernatural entities that may or may not exist outside of the minds of the protagonists? Do any of these reviewers really think Larry Fessenden is trying to suggest that this is what's really going on with the environment?

It struck me more as a ""what if"" film. If I watch a film about a young girl possessed by demonic entities, I don't base my enjoyment of it on whether or not I believe in god, the devil, or the minions of either.

I can enjoy The Exorcist, whether or not I believe that the events it depicts could happen in real life..

(puts soapbox away)

The Last Winter is slow, but very atmospheric. Comparisons to the John Carpenter version of The Thing are pretty apt, with regards to setting and tone, although The Last Winter is far less bleak and paranoid, and the characters are more appealing.

It certainly takes its time developing and the effects are modest, but fairly effective. Or maybe I just have a soft-spot in my heart for daemonic elk? Some very nice performances, as well, although Ron Pearlman's character is perhaps a bit overdone. The swooping camera movement that mimics the viewpoint of the crows (ravens?) that appear in the film as they fly over the survey camp was a very nice touch.

It's an eerie film, one that stayed with me for days afterward. And beautiful, as well. Maybe a horror film for those with a ""photographic sensibility""? Certainly not a film for those who only like their horror dumb and bloody. You do have to participate a bit in this one, and I always feel like that helps keep me involved.",1218585600,19,2078,4.6

8263270,3,B0016MJ6JM,"An interesting movie that has a range of good and bad points.

A brief synopsis would be that here we have a small group of people in a very harsh environment who start to experience supernatural things. A sort of cabin fever sets in and they hold on to their reason to differing extents. The fact that this is played out in the harsh arctic adds a different dimension to things. As per any extreme of nature, you only need a couple of minor things to go wrong before you are deeply in trouble. Throw in people losing their minds - or having their minds messed with by the supernatural - is hardly going to help.....

Outside of Ron Perlman there are no really big names here for my mind and the acting isn't always brilliant. But it is steady enough and given what appears to have been a limited budget the movie gets the job done that it set out to do. And this has been achieved through old fashioned suspense and through the movie not really bothering to explain much what on earth is the nature of the supernatural. In many movies you get that mapped out for you. That X sort of monster wants Y to happen. Here it is more vague. And again, the setting of the film is part of the reason it works. The sense of tension would not be anywhere near as high without the film conveying a sense of isolation.
