7958035,4,B000062XF5,"One reviewer stated that if any movie can be described as pure, root-for-the-hero entertainment, it's this one. It's a good, glossy, old-fashioned film set in a P.O.W. camp in which the inmates are plotting one of the most daring escapes ever attempted. The events are loosely based on a true story. While the third part of the film (which is after the escape) doesn't match the tension and excitement of acts one and two, it's no big deal.
This DVD is presented in widescreen (2.55:1). There are some signs of grain and compression, but for the most part the picture looks sharp and bright and relatively scratch free. There are some extras as well (but being an early DVD, not a whole lot). There is a not-very-good documentary (""The Making of The Great Escape"") and a fun theatrical trailer, as well as a booklet that's worth reading for fans of the film.",1047513600,,858,4.651315789473684
