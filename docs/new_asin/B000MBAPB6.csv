The 10-part series focuses on the impact that connecting with ancestors has on individuals and families. Hosts Jim and Terry Willard, amateur genealogists, introduce the topic of each 30-minute episode which consists of two components, a 'mini-documentary' and a 'how-to' segment. ANCESTORS goes on location to visit with family historians of various social, economic and ethnic backgrounds to find out why they began a search for family history and how that search has changed their lives. Each mini-documentary is followed by an instructional conversation between the hosts and various genealogical experts. These conversations are intended to help beginning family historians get started.""
