8564184,5,B00B8O4V1G,"This DVD is great. The producer provides a wealth of variation in workouts and combination of these exercises. It will challenge your cardio/respiratory system, but help you build progressively to the higher level. Recommend this DVD if you are into Krav Maga. He combines many of the moves with resistance bands. Get it.",1414972800,,321,5.0754716981132075
