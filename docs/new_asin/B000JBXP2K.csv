8149623,5,B000JBXP2K,"This documentary rises above most documentaries. Especially those typical band documentaries that usually just glorify a band and feed the curiosities of their fans.
The movie actually uses the band as a vehicle to to drive through many controversial and important topics. from punk rock to radical feminism, sexual politics and sexual abuse and how to find your own way to express yourself, define yourself... and just basically be yourself. You get the privilege of getting a deep and intimate connection with the subjects of the movie. basically the tribe 8 band- their early childhood, the defining moments in their life, how it influenced them to become who they are and the ups and downs they went through as a band and as individuals. But you get much more than just getting to know this important band. It really opens up a lot of tabo subjects and lets you explore with the film makers not only the subjects views about certain issues but also your own.
On a technical note the movie is put together from many video sources, band archive and what not. the quality of the footage isn't the best at times but this is a documentary so it just adds to the feeling of seeing raw life edited.
the extra content is also good, giving insight to the filmmakers point of view and how this movie came to be as well as some extra interviews.
For anyone who is interested in seeing how music can make a difference and much more this is a must. Don't hesitate in getting this movie. You won't regret it.",1226793600,,1498,4.593283582089552

This is an awesome, hilarious history on the ups, downs and ups of the legendary band Tribe 8.",1199923200,2,295,5.020408163265306
