8676317,5,B00N56C5SG,Great product.  It allows me to get the kids to put some air under the ball.  Also great for contact drills.,1492732800,,108,4.095238095238095
8676318,3,B00N56C5SG,"The pads work great at making the player read and react to the defender, gives them exaggerated movements such as reaching in for the ball, shooting over the defender, working the ball around the defender etc.....  These have been very useful in several drills.

The downside, is the durability versus price.  I can already see some wear on the corner seams and it won't be long before they are coming apart if I don't try to repair them with some fabric glue or something similar.  I would have preferred them to be made of boxing glove or punching bag material.",1465171200,,563,4.6
