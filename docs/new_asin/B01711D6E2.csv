7486227,5,B01711D6E2,"This was truly a great set of videos and probably the best set in this season so far.  The voices are great as usual and the one voice that really stands out to me is ivankoff's voice.  There is a lot of comedy in this set as well as a lot of action and it does see the return of a lot of big characters, such as crocodile and Blackbeard.  Can't wait to finish off this season later this year",1454457600,,392,3.875
7486228,5,B01711D6E2,Excellent.,1454457600,,10,10.0
7486229,4,B01711D6E2,"Perhaps the main highlight of this volume is the introduction of a new character named Emporio Ivankov AKA Iva-chan who is probably the weirdest character thus far in the series since Jango toward the beginning.  Ivankov is obviously modeled after Tim Curry's Dr. Frank N. Furter on Rocky Horror Picture Show (permed hair, lipstick, mascara, fishnet stockings, and all).  It gets weirder, as Ivankov has hormone based Devil Fruit abilities that can, among other things, change a person's gender.  Luffy is barely alive due to Magellan's poison when Bon Clay brings him to Ivankov's secret lair in the prison.  Partly because Bon Clay is a fellow okama (male transvestite) and partly because Ivankov is a trusted lieutenant to Luffy's father in the Revolutionary Army, Ivankov is willing to do what he can to save Luffy's life.  Luffy recovers quickly from Ivankov's treatment, and Ivankov and the rest of his followers join Luffy and Bon Clay in the effort to rescue Ace.  At the bottom of the prison, Luffy gains perhaps the unlikeliest ally of all and on the way back up reunites with the man who seems destined to become his arch enemy.",1453680000,3,1139,4.875647668393782
