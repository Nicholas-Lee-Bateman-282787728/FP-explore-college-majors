8021010,5,B00022XEGI,"This is our favorite French learning series, and we've tried several.  I am still finding that nothing beats working one on one with a child, but if you are going to use a video, this series is the one.",1510444800,,202,4.17948717948718

8021013,5,B00022XEGI,"I found Bonjour Les Amis! Volume 2 to be excellent in every way, considering that it is intended for children. Sound quality is excellent
(at least on my copy), vocabulary is introduced well and this DVD has an interesting facet to it that would even interest adults: it goes into
French culture by using actual video of the French town of Chateaurenaud and describing various aspects of life that are seldom found in the guidebooks, such as the meaning of a line drawn through the name of a French town on a road sign (it means that you are leaving the town),
the color of French mailboxes (yellow), and why road signs are on the right side of the road (in France, one drives on the right). There are two
songs and both lyrics to the songs and the vocabulary used in the video may be found on the menu of the DVD. My five year-old granddaughter,
whose attention span is typical for her age, loves this DVD and actually LEARNS from it!",1425081600,,935,4.410404624277457
8021014,3,B00022XEGI,Cute character but a little boring for kids.,1408579200,,44,4.625
8021015,3,B00022XEGI,"The quality of this first DVD in the series (vol 1) is MUCH better than vol 2 which is better than vol 3.  as the series progresses, the production quality gets poorer and poorer.  I can hardly bear to watch the vol 3 dvd.  The live video is horribly, grainy and out of focus.  And the frame rate on the animation reduced from being measured in frames per second to seconds per frame.  perhaps they had to recude the budget on Vol 2 and vol 3 to pay for the actors?",1393804800,,465,4.065934065934066
8021016,1,B00022XEGI,This show is painfully outdated and boring! It couldn't hold my two-year-old's attention for more than ten seconds. So glad I ended up renting this instead of buying it. I recommend the Little Pim series instead,1369353600,2,211,4.888888888888889
8021017,4,B00022XEGI,"My daughters are 3 and 5 and love moustache...  I have been speaking French to them since they were babies (I am by no means fluent myself, although I did take it in school for 7 years).  I also homeschool, and we have structured French learning for about 15 minutes a day as part of the curriculum.  We do bonjour les amis once a week as part of this plan, and the girls love it, especially the songs.  It also helps to hear another voice speaking French for their pronunciation.  I believe this is a very good addition to kids just starting out.  There is enough new vocabulary and repition to help actually learn something.",1287705600,5,626,4.4
8021018,2,B00022XEGI,My daughter is five and in a French immersion school.  I bought this DVD in the hope that it would reinforce what she hears at school since I can't.  She barely paid attention.  My recommendation is that you go to Amazon Canada and check out the Caillou and Kirikou dvds.  She LOVES those!,1261353600,9,289,4.39622641509434
