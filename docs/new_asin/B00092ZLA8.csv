2261078,4,B00092ZLA8,"This movie is NOT a big screen multimillion dollar budget film.

This movie IS rather good within it's genre, namely SOFT core porn.

the good -

The music was better than most errotic films, better than the local radio for that matter.

The errotic scenes and situations were surprisingly sensual.

Amazingly all of the actresses and actors on screen were *very* attractive and had some rudimentary screen pressence.

The camera didn't shake.

the bad -

Definately second rate budget film effects by modern standards.

Less skin than some movies on friday night cinemax (skinamax).

Some dialogue scenes had all the polish of a daytime soap opera.

as a big screen hollywood film? i'd give it maybe 1 star because of all its shortcomings (though if they'd taken 3x as long and 10x as much money making it, it could have made a go of it on the silver screen)

as 'show all' porno, i'd give it 1 star because of what it didn't show.

as a soft core porn / 'errotica' film, i'd give it 4 stars. and since that is what it is, that's my rating.",1121040000,4,1041,4.502673796791444
2261079,1,B00092ZLA8,"Cheesy plot?  Check.

Cheesy acting?  Check.

Cheesy special effects?  Check.

Hot women?  Check.

Hot women getting nekkid (yes I spelled it wrong)?  Not even a little bit.

I know this sounds chauvinistic but if you're going to be a b-flick that has weak acting, cheesy dialogue, and a dumb plot, then you better either have Bruce Campbell in the lead or hot women getting nekkid.  Preferrably both.  This movie has neither though the opportunities were plentiful.  This was a free rental and somehow, I still feel cheated.",1120089600,4,525,4.896551724137931
2261080,2,B00092ZLA8,"Christine (Jennifer Holland) is a new student at Greenway College, and it's sorority rush week, something she has no interest in. Psychology professor Ms Masters (Barbara Crampton) recognizes that Christine has special psychic powers and enlists her help to stop the sisters of the Beta Alpha Tau (BAT) sorority as they corrupt everyone on campus and take their souls.

Christine joins BAT and soon learns just how seductive sorority president Devin (Michelle Borth) is. Part of the initiation involves sex with Devin and other sorority sisters. Christine watches and resists at first, but then joins in. It's almost soft core to a beat, but not really, just a lot of lingerie and touching that's not quite in the right places :-)

Then we've got an unoriginal plot to stop Devin and the vampires. I kept expecting Ms Masters to rip her tight blouse off to give the film some redeeming erotic quality, but alas, that never happens.",1119744000,3,931,4.923566878980892

8056884,2,B00092ZLA8,"Vampires, hot sorority girls, ""B""movie....
It didn't sound all that bad to me since I am a vampire and 'b' movie lover.
I was mislead. This flick was terrible, a waste of time, money, and energy.
The acting was choppy and bad, the filming wasn't too bad, but the settings were that of low budget porn, and the story - while mildly interesting at first - ended up terrible as well. The chicks were decent looking, but even for guys looking for a hot chick on chick thrill, it is not worth it.
I saw a preview for this somewhere and it looked really good for a low budget film.
Don't be fooled.",1299888000,,592,4.247787610619469

8056886,5,B00092ZLA8,"As the relative of an actress in this film - I AM SURE IT'S AWESOME. Not that I have seen it yet. It's kinda hard to find, what with it being a straight to video release with a bunch of no-name actors by a pretty unheard of director. Hmmm, not sure it's not in my REDBOX at the local McDonald's.

Go Brenda Blade!!!! Remember, plenty of superstars got killed by Jason, Freddy and Micheal Myers.

8056887,2,B00092ZLA8,"I had anticipated the arrival of this movie, even recognizing a much over done plot senario. While there were a couple of new wrinkles in this movie, they of themselves could not save the day. If there was ever a movie that cried out for an unrated version, this would be it. That would have at least classified it as a soft-core release, and perhaps satisfied some in that respect. After all there are some degenerate souls out there that enjoy lesbian vampire movies. We know who we are, don't we? Hee! Hee! However, you have to get beyond bra, and panties to be soft-core. Further, to be a vampire flick there has to be some neck munching, which in this case was only implied, except one instance occuring very late in the movie, and didn't really seem to have much to do with the main plot. As with the ending, I can't ruin the suspense for anyone, because I'm not even sure whether good, or evil prevaled. Better rent it, if you can find it.",1126742400,,946,4.380681818181818
8056888,1,B00092ZLA8,"I had already purchased a double DVD of David DeCoteau's; the Brotherhood, and the Brotherhood II.

Sisterhood shares similar features. Young nice looking cast, set in a university campus. Young naieve person the target of 'seduction' by evil. That's the good points.

The bad points are the 'seductions' are so lame - no one gets down to more than underwear. This happens a lot, but no scene ever really goes anywhere. Such a great chance to be a little bit sexy, but David DeCoteau reals back prudishly... making for very lame sequences.

In this, the vampirism is really only evident right at the very end, when the head of the 'sisterhood' bears her fangs just once before dying. Thus it fails on several levels; it's not scary, it's not sexy, it's not really much about vampires.

Had I known this film was also by him (my own fault), I'd not have bought it - based on the 'formula' of the other two films mentioned above.",1124323200,18,927,4.6
8056889,1,B00092ZLA8,"When I saw the DVD box cover and read that this film was about hot & seductive sorority girl witches, I knew this one had to be good.  I WAS SO WRONG!!!  Director David Decoteau would have us believe this video centers around hot girls doing things with other hot girls, but in reality Decoteau appears to be more interested in HOT GUYS?!!  Seriously, this film was NOT EROTIC for those of us hoping to see girls with other girls.  Perhaps Mr. Decoteau should make a DVD called ""Brotherhood"" about a gay fraternity.  I think that's where his heart is.",1123545600,8,551,4.47
8056890,1,B00092ZLA8,"I like cheesey horror. But this film was nothing more than soft-core porn. If you want to watch porno, why not watch the real thing? Disappointing on all levels. 1 Star.",1122681600,5,169,4.483870967741935
