Peyton's 1977 book  It is set in 1818 and is the story of a coachman who is hired to win a stagecoach race, upon which a significant wager is made.  There is, of course, a girl and a horse involved.",1400371200,2,304,4.135593220338983
8244406,5,B00127P5YG,"I adore Rupert Everett, so anything he's in is a great movie to me automatically.  That Jane Eyre comes on the same disc is an added bonus and the price was really good for such a hard to find movie.

Right Hand Man is definitely worth watching.  I won't tell you what it's about and spoil the suspense and mystery of it, but it's good, so get it and watch it.  Rupert Everett is definitely one of the most underrated actors of today.",1371686400,,434,4.192771084337349
