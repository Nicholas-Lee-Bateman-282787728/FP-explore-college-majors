8715867,1,B00XGRGF4Y,"What a sham!  Advertised to lead one to believe it is an new movie, but no actors are listed.  Actually, it is ancient with Orson Welles as King Saul and a terrible cast of actors.  The worst movie I've ever seen and perhaps ever made!",1445126400,,235,4.177777777777778
8715868,1,B00XGRGF4Y,I thought it was the new movie not the classic,1443398400,,46,3.7
8715869,1,B00XGRGF4Y,"After reading the positive reviews on Amazon for this version, thought it would the perfect thing for a rainy Thursday night at home. I want my money and time back. This has to be about the worst movie I have ever seen. At first, I thought it would be a parody, Goliath sounds like a steroid-enraged California dude. Even the landscape looks like where it was filmed, outside of Los Angeles, not exactly the Holy Land. David's faith is noble but surrounded by the awful actors and out-of-step costumes (i.e. the Israelite's are dressed as Roman's). I've seen better acting at a Community Playhouse. Save your time and money. There is another movie titled David & Goliath with Jerry Sokolosky which is the one I think everyone raved about and which I thought this was what I was watching.",1441929600,5,787,4.669064748201439
8715870,1,B00XGRGF4Y,Bought this because the info lead me to belive it was the new movie that came out earlier this year.  And when I got it was the old one.  I was miss lead! ! Not happy at all! !!!,1437782400,,178,3.5384615384615383
