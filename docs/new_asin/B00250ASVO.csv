8350908,4,B00250ASVO,"I just ordered a 7 dvd set from the Watch me learn website, they have a 50% off sale for school, not sure if it's a limited time offer sort of thing. It is just under 80 dollars with free shipping for 7 dvds. You could also get 5 dvds for just under 70 with, I assume, free shipping. The psychologist recommended these modeling videos when my son was evaluated and diagnosed with Autism, he is almost 6 yrs. old now. He just started kindergarten and is having a lot of trouble adjusting. I couldn't imagine paying 30 bucks per dvd, so I checked craigslist, and found the website charging 15 per dvd, but with major discounts for buying sets. I will update my reviews once I receive and use them. Save money look around! :)",1441929600,,722,4.3161764705882355
