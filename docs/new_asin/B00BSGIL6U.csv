8573305,5,B00BSGIL6U,"Unlike other ballet class DVDs which I have, this one gives a complete class without any interruptions or corrections from the teacher.
Oksana Maslova demonstrates the barre and center exercises beautifully.  She wears pointe shoes, but the class can be done in regular ballet
slippers.  I get a good workout just from doing the barre!  My only criticism is that Oksana doesn't repeat some of the center combinations on the left side, probably to save time.  This DVD along with Venti Petrov's Vol. 2 are my favorites now.",1472860800,,522,4.8977272727272725
8573306,5,B00BSGIL6U,"I highly recommend this DVD.  Venti Petrov's class is well-constructed.  Oksana Maslova is a beautiful dancer and the piano accompaniment by
Olga Merson is wonderful.  Oksana demonstrates the barre and center exercises without any interruptions from Venti, so you get a very good
workout.  She is so flexible and inspiring!  Even though she does some of the barre exercises ""en pointe,"" you can do most of them in regular ballet slippers.  The same applies to center work.  My one criticism is that the red tutu which Oksana is wearing prevents you from seeing her legs clearly.
I think a short practice skirt would be better.  I also have Vol. 1 which I enjoy using and am hoping Venti comes out with Vol. 3 in the future.",1472256000,,723,4.682539682539683
