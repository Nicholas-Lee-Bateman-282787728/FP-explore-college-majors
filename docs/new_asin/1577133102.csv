7798983,3,1577133102,"Three star review says it all, it's just okay.  This is largely because of the print, which is old, faded, a bit battered and doesn't have that clear an image in the first place.  Even so, I'm not sure a fresh print of this film would help it much, as the shots are pretty basic, the SFX for the time are standard, and the acting is so-so and uninspired for the time.  It's a B-movie pirate flick from an era that's long gone.

The movie begins with a ship under sail on the ocean. A British man-of-war fires a shot to stop them for boarding. The British seek their subjects on American ships. Congress declared war on Great Britain June 18, 1812. French citizens will lend $10 million in gold to build American ships, but a fast ship is needed to run the blockade. They want an officer skilled in naval techniques for this. Captain Marshall seeks Walters for his second in command. Their ship silently slips out on the tide. Can they escape the British ship? Only if it is disabled. They hoist all the sails to make good time. Does the captain spill the beans? The gun crew considers their options; they keep apart from the rest of the crew. Captain Walters returns from France with a passenger: his wife Leslie. The gold has been smuggle aboard in disguise! Trouble seems to be developing aboard.

Can they escape the British 74-gun warship? Yes, if they lighten the ship by tossing their cannon overboard. Captain Marshall saves a gunner. Will Walters' wife tempt him? At 8 bells the gun crew break into the armory for pistols and begin the mutiny. Walters is in command now. Or is he? [Nobody hears those splashes?] Captain Marshall nears land and is rescued by the Navy. They sail towards Havana and hope to intercept Walters. The crew trades for grog. Walters hears their singing. The Navy sends a boarding crew to the `Concord' and takes the ship. Will Walters and Leslie make a deal? Can that submersible be used to attack the British warship and save their ship and cargo? Captain Marshall and Walters try to do so. It works! Marshall escapes alone.

This movie is less than average. What was the intent of this story? It is not based on a true story. The use of toy ships is appropriate for a low budget production. A submersible ""turtle"" was tried in New York in the Revolutionary War, but it was a failure. So too the Civil War version. Did Angela Lansbury play a villainess in other films? Given the situation in 1812 it seems unlikely that Frenchmen would risk a tremendous sum of $10 million in gold on a loan to a small country. That is an incredibly high amount for 1812. The whole story seems to be adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"".",1300924800,,2264,4.612903225806452

(5.1) Mutiny (1952) - Mark Stevens/Angela Lansbury/Patric Knowles/Gene Evans/Rhys Williams/Morris Ankrum (uncredited: Clayton Moore/Denver Pyle/Gene Roth/Norman Leavitt)",1299283200,,2908,11.150627615062762
7798991,3,1577133102,"Mutiny, n. Revolt or rebellion against constituted authority, esp. by sailors against their officers.

 Well, that's what MUTINY is about, alright.  The War of 1812 has broken out, the British are at the gates of Washington (with their torches) and Captain James Marshall is ordered to run a blockade or two and collect a vitally needed ten millions in gold from the French to aid the war effort.  Marshall (Mark Stevens) recruits the out-of-favor Ben Waldridge (Patric Knowles) to act as his first mate.  Waldridge is a brilliant commander but a little light of fingers when it comes to other people's money, and was expelled by the British Navy for embezzlement.  Anyway, per custom, Waldridge is allowed to pick his own crew, a scabrous host of blackguards and cutthroats whose patriotism lags far behind their lust for, in rough order, grog, gold and girls.  The girl is Leslie (Angela Lansbury,) a delicate beauty who is not only Waldridge's distant and unforgettable love (the one article of gear he takes on the mission is her framed portrait,) but, in a happy coincidence, is also living in the same French district where the gold is to be collected.  Marshall's plan is to collect the gold as quickly as possible and use it to help defend his country.  Waldridge's plan is to take advantage of Marshall's nave and misplaced trust in him and, once the gold and the girl are aboard ship, rally his men to mutiny.

MUTINY isn't a great movie and the dvd-transfer is awful and nearly impossible to watch.  It was produced by the b-movie studio King Brothers Productions and, although the ocean scenes are pretty well done, the movie claustrophobically confines itself to a very few sets.  And the Stevens character - the good captain - is a little too good to work as a foil for the true star of this film, the conflicted and miserable, in spirit and action, Ben Waldridge.  Stevens plays his character as written, the way they used to write FBI agents back then - strait-laced, buttoned-up, and bland as porridge.

 Which brings us to director Edward Dmytryk and why some will find MUTINY more than just a ripping sea yarn.  Dmytryk was one of the Hollywood 10, ""Communist subversives"" (note the quotation marks) rounded up by HUAC in a multi-pronged effort to clean up Hollywood.  Dmytryk testified before HUAC, spent time in jail for his Communist activities, then later testified - named names - before HUAC.  That testimony occurred in 1951.  MUTINY (1952) was the first film he made after that testimony was given, and if Dmytryk's memoirs are to be believed, his disgust with and distrust of Communist agents in America was strong.  The Communists, I believe Dmytryk believed, had tried to overthrow the constituted authority of the US government.  In that context MUTINY acquires another dimension (probably explains why one of the main mutineers is named Redlegs, too, come to think of it), and, if I haven't stretched it too far already, Dmytryk saw a lot of himself in the disgraced, but basically decent, Captain Waldridge.

 Although MUTINY is a low-budget action film, the penurious King Brothers had an eye for talent and made some good movies - Dillinger, Gun Crazy - along the way.  Besides Dmytryk, the film was scored by Dimitri Tiomkin and photographed by Ernest Laszlo, both Academy Award winners.  The dvd-transfer wastes most of it - the images are dark and muddy, the sound could have been cleaned up.  Still, if you're in the mood for an old-fashioned sea adventure, this one shouldn't disappoint.",1170115200,3,3527,4.865996649916248
