3791533,5,B001TKKB1I,I have built quite a library of DVD cartoons to eventually go to my grandson. Tom & Jerry is one of his favorite set of characters. I really enjoy hearing the little guy laugh so intensely. I also enjoy them.,1352160000,,208,4.225
3791534,4,B001TKKB1I,"I bought this as a gift... the kids totally love it... the only reason i took a star away is that when they received the DVD is was rattaling in the case, the part that hold the DVD in the case broke off... so the DVDs can't be held in place in the box... but the DVD were not scratched and work perfectly.  Thanks",1340323200,,314,3.90625
3791535,5,B001TKKB1I,"Love,love Tom & Jerry! It is the best cartoon ever made! I'm trying to order as many T&J dvds as I can. I'd like to pass them on from generation to generation. I understand you can easily watch them for free on the Internet, but there's nothing like actually owning them. My kids (varying in age) love watching them and they never get old.",1335139200,,339,4.3125

3791538,4,B001TKKB1I,"These are classic Tom and Jerry cartoons from the 40s/50s. No Chuck Jones, thank goodness. Personally, I do not care for the Chuck Jones directed ones. Anyway, there are 14 o 15 shorts -- not remastered. The sound goes low in 3 of them and then comes back to normal. I really didn't pay attention to this since there's not any dialouge. The picture looks as if they transferred it right from the 16mm. But it's not completely horrible. No Mammy Two Shoes. Cartoons included on this disc are Jerry's Cousin, Jerry and the Goldfish, Slicked Up Pup, Quiet Please -- also, the one where Tom is dressed up as a baby and 3 cats make fun of him, the one where the bird falls in love with Tom, ""Just Whistle"" with Spike helping Jerry. I have been wanting to buy the Spotlight collections but have been hesitant because of the reviews saying they are edited. I love Tom and Jerry, but I want the uncut versions. Even without Mammy Two Shoes, the Greatest Chases DVDs are worth getting.",1247097600,12,976,4.4581005586592175

3791559,3,B001TKKB1I,"I just wanted more of the old Tom and Jerry cartoons, the ones from the earlier days, directed by Hanna Barbara. This DVD has a large selection for the $5 price, my kids love them. I had bought the volume 1 before this one and my kids watch it a ton, so this one fits the bill to add to the collection.

Update: I have had this DVD for a few weeks now and have watched it a few times with my kids. I don't really like this one as much as volume 1! This one is just depressing on some episodes. For example, on the first episode, Tom and some other cat friend catch Jerry and the friend holds Jerry down on a stump while Tom aims an axe, ready to chop Jerry in half. Then a little devil appears on Tom's shoulder and tells Tom instead to chop up his friend, for some reason. It would be fine if they just get on with it, but a lot of time is spent on this scene, and we're forced to sit and watch and think about what is happening! Depressing! There's lots of bulldogs with big, white, sharp teeth, and even one episode where Tom goes fishing and the fish have big, white, sharp teeth. It gets to be too much. I know, 'well, that's what Tom and Jerry is all about! they kill each other without killing each other!' But this volume is depressing. Volume 1 is WAY better for overall good Tom and Jerry fun.",1374624000,2,1303,4.050387596899225
