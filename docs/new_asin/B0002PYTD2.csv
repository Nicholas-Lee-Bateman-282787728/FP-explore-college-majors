2114877,5,B0002PYTD2,"As hilarious and groundbreaking as season one of In Living Color was, I was blown away by the second season. Some of the highlights from this season included Kelly Coffield's hilarious ""Velma Mulholland"", ""Magenta Thompson"" and ""Andrea Dice Clay"" characters. Other standouts are the return of Homey the Clown, the return of Blaine & Antoine, Anton Jackson, the debut of Handi-Man and Wes and Les Rawls. One of my favorite sketches was the ""Foundation of Golf Heritage"" where a controversy erupts when the PGA refuses to host a golf tournament at an all-white country club. The image of Tommy Davidson and David Alan Grier arriving at the golf course playing loud rap music (and dressed like Run DMC) and playing golf like one would play pool or basketball- is enough to make you split your sides in laughter.

The only complaint I have about the box set is some sketches some to have been deleted. I can't find Jim Carrey's Vanilla Ice parody in there anywhere. And there is a noticeable part in the end credits where the names of the artists who were played is deleted. Also in the sketch where Anton goes to the recruiter he sings a song at the end that is deleted on the box-set. He basically sings, ""Be all that you can be. Get an ugly wife and a messed up life in the army!""

Why it was deleted, I have no clue. Other than that, it's a killer DVD box set.",1096416000,8,1360,4.479838709677419

2114880,5,B0002PYTD2,"I have some fond memories of sitting in front of the TV set those Sunday nights at 9 O'Clock watching this great show.  I probably never missed an episode.

Here in season two we are introduced to my favorite character of this series:  Fire Marshal Bill, played by Jim Carrey.  He was a crazy character.  He was always getting burnt-up or blown-up in some ridiculous way with a product that seems safe (and usually was until Fire Marshal Bill got his hands on it).  His catch-phrase was ""Let me show you something""

There were so many memorable recurring sketchs from this show, it really was the best show on TV.  Most would say the Simpsons or something (which you know that I loved), but the Wayans family and Jim Carrey, come on now.

The Snack Shack; Damon Wayans' prison character with the messed-up vocabulary; the ""Men on"" segments; Jim Carrey's Vanilla Ice impression; the lady who loved to gossip (especially about Miss Jenkins); The Brothers Brothers skits (the whitest black guys you'll meet); Handicap Man; the Homeboy Shopping Network; Damon Wayans' detective who was only a head, hands, and feet; Hey Mon; and who could forget Homey the Clown (which the advertising world loved, and hey, so did I)

Check out this DVD when it comes out.",1094256000,20,1251,4.723502304147465

2114894,4,B0002PYTD2,"The second season of ""In Living Color,"" was better than the first season with twice as many episodes and skits. The cast including Jim Carrey, Tom Davidson, David Alan Grier, Kelly Coffield and the series creator Keenan Ivory Wayan return after the first season with an Emmy award for writing. The second season was just as funny if not funnier than the first season.

The four DVD sets include commentary for some of the episodes. This season introduced Jim Carrey's beloved Fire Marshal Bill to the series. Blaine and Antoine return to offer views for ""Men on Film"" or ""Men on Television"" and ""Men on Art."" Can't get enough of Jim Carrey's Vera in ""The Pretty Buffed Woman"" spoof. I loved the parodies here as well. I didn't care for the Brothers Brothers. Clown Homey falls in love with his new parole officer. I didn't like Handi-Man.

If you loved the first season, you will enjoy the second season DVD. I didn't care for the commentaries on episodes as I find them distracting from the series.",1472947200,,999,4.670454545454546

  In Living Color You Can Do What You Want to Do

  by

Mark Walter Meredith

  Therefore, In Living Color the Series is back on TV, Eleven oclock Central, twelve oclock Eastern.  Now I have always had a problem with this show.  Once at a newspaper I used to work at on this newspaper writing stint I did for about 10 years on and off (mostly off) a certain young woman was going to write an article about it.  In addition, I expected her to do the subject justice.
  Nevertheless, when the article came out it was short and I was disappointed to find whom it barely scratched the surface.  She had not written down any of the things I had suggested she write about.  I guess she had waited until the last minute like everyone else (besides me.  Of course) and then slapped everything down fast into her article as quickly as possible in a mad slap dash manner.
  What makes it all worse is whom the common-senseless people above me put the title of the article directly under my three-panel cartoon, Stereotypes are Not Funny. close to nothing else.  Making it look like they were making some example of the cartoon strip.
  Now Damon Wayans used to be disabled himself (he used to wear an orthopedic shoe. One with a thick sole) but I don't think its fair for him to make fun of handicapped people.  His handicapped superhero with the clubbed-like wing-like right arm and slurred manner of speech is offensive; also the handicapped heros weakness.  His own form of kryptonite that Wayans named after disabled people.
  Ive seen and Oprah show the other day about how people call each other names in high school.  About how white kids will even, call African American kids the n-word unprovoked and I think I know where it all started.  From Michael Richards the show Your Momma.  To films to whatever stuff, I might have missed.
  It all starts with In Living Color.  Keenan Ivory Wayans whom put up the money for the show and came up with the show has a concept.  Make fun of everybody else and there will be no more people treated differently.  Whose idea seems to have exploded in his face?
  Here is a sample of the lyrics of the shows beginning song,
In Living Color
  You can do what you want to do
In living color
In living color
You can do what you want to do
  In living color
You can go to the moon
  Float like a balloon
  Its never too late
  Moreover, its never too soon
  Take it from me its tight to be
  In living color
Moreover, how would you feel knowing whom prejudice is obsolete?
Moreover, humankind danced to a new beat
Moreover, at night it was safe to walk down
The street
  In living color
  You could do what you want to do in living color.

  I don't want to see disabled people with their heads bashed in on the sidewalks and people bragging about how they were bashing their heads in while cracking jokes like Spider-Man.

2114961,3,B0002PYTD2,music video spoofs aren't included on any of the ILC seasons--i read because of a dispute over licensing/money/property rights.,1187568000,2,127,5.7368421052631575
2114962,5,B0002PYTD2,I thought this show was always funny.  I used to watch this back in the early 90's.  The actors were all very funny and quite entertaining.  This was an extremely popular show back in the 90s.  There was a reason for this because it was original and the comedians knew how to make people laugh.,1174262400,3,294,4.290909090909091
2114963,4,B0002PYTD2,"Now at least I know WHY the search for the Jim Carrey ""Vanilla Ice"" video was in vain!  Here, I had bragged to several friends about ILC seasons---several of them who only recalled a few skittish, hilarious episodes at the time---that they HAD to see the Jim Carrey mock up of Vanilla Ice----only to discover the editors axed it from the Season II video series.  What was up with that?!  Talk about dirty and cheap!  And the ""Vanilla Ice"" video was one of best reasons to view the Season 2 release!

In any event..... the entire series--which inevitably aired from 1990 to mid 1994--is worth the DVD video collection. My all time favorite is of course Vera DeMilo; Mistress of Destruction.  For a long time, I thought Carrey wore a wig  during the skits, but then heck realized, that's his REAL hair, up in pigtails---CLASSIC!  His skeletal Fire Marshall Bill is always funny too---but it doesn't beat out Vera DeMilo by a longshot!

Kim Wayans, the least talented of any of the Wayans family actors, saves some of her own grace in stunning, strong comical performances of Oprah, Grace Jones, Cephus (pronounced Cee Phee), Laquita (I love Laquita --mock up of ""I Love Lucy"") and Big Mama (the Snack Shack skits). The rest of the other part character roles she attempts fall completely flat otherwise.

Much of late Season 3 and going in to Season 4 are not really worth the bother. This was time when Copyrights were violated through FOX network, and Keenan Wayans discovered reruns of Seasons 1 and 2 were being illegally pirated (aired) on cable TV. Wayans had now left the show he'd created and produced, to another production team, where as hence most of his family actors followed suit---and the network had to last-minute recast most of the original cast. The new writing and skits barely managed to pull off at least some of the comical liking of Wayan's original success. Of course this being also the time, much like Carrey (JIM), that the others endured successful movie careers----

Season 4 falls completely short, as the left successed, remaining talented cast, which still includes Tommy Davidson, Kim Wayans, and Jamie Foxx, struggling to keep things thumping along. But the comical impact is downgraded, to an obvious level here. Most of the skits are sorry overworked, with little pause for creativity and laughs.",1145491200,6,2330,4.843828715365239

10. The sexy fly girls, especially the fine Lisa.

11. Cephus & Reesie (one of the funniest Ashford and Simpson like skits.  I really loved the Last Request skit of C&R)

12. Fire Marshall Bill (he got funnier on season 3)

13. That poor actress that taught that class (""OUTTA MY WAY, BITCH!!"")

14. I Love Laquita with Billy Dee Williams (Williams tried so hard to dance in the closing credits, but the old guy just did push ups)

15. Handi Man sketches

16. Homeboy Shoppin' Network (""I'm bout to go crazy!!  Don't do that homeboy!!  I'm sorry folks bu that was only a display item!"" - Ghetto Fabulous!)

17. All the Anton sketches

Damon Wayans, David Alan Grier, Tommy Davidson, Kim Wayans, and T'kea Knight were the main highlights of the season as well as the series (before Jaimee came in).  A must have show although they false advertised the buyers by not having the complete episodes.  Thats why it gets 4 stars instead of 5!  Overall, I love it!!

2114986,5,B0002PYTD2,"Nominated for 17 Emmys in its short four-year stint, In Living Color is widely considered the best skit comedy show since SNL. Created by the multitalented star Keenen Ivory Wayans (the eldest child from a large and talented family), the 30-minute TV show became an instant hit for emerging big network competitor FOX in the spring of 1990. Showcasing the talents of the Wayans family (especially blockbuster talent Damon Wayans), along with initial cast members David Alan Grier, Tommy Davidson, Kim Coles, T'keyah ""Crystal"" Keymah, Kelly Coffield, and Jim Carrey (who would use the show as a springboard to smash hit movie career that would begin with Ace Ventura: Pet Detective in 1994), In Living Color quickly achieved the status of TV cult icon...

Along with clever, cutting-edge writing, In Living Color featured a plethora of talented cast members who would move on to enormously successful Hollywood careers. The show's dance troop, The Fly Girls, hired an ambitious dancer named Jennifer Lopez for the show's final season, and Season 2 of the show involved the hire of Oscar Award-winning actor Jamie Foxx (of Collateral and Ray). For its final season, In Living Color also featured notable appearances by comedian Chris Rock. Along the way, the series would create a number of legendary recurring characters such as Homey D. Clown (Damon Wayans), Fire Marshall Bill (Jim Carrey), and Men on Film (Damon Wayans & David Alan Grier)...

In Living Color (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Big Brother"" in which Queen Latifah guest hosts and serves as the musical guest as well. This first episode also features the popular skit ""Men on Films II""... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Anton at the Recruiter"" which features skits ""Roseanne Sings America"" and ""Homey the Clown: When Homey Met Sally,"" and ""Funky Productions"" which features Jim Carrey in the sketch ""Vera De Milo: Buffed, Beautiful, and Bitchin'""...

2114987,5,B0002PYTD2,"The Greatest sketch comedy in the early 90's. My favorite sketches are Vera Demilo,Homey,the 3 champs,and especially the Men on film! this is worth the price.",1108425600,3,158,5.115384615384615
2114988,1,B0002PYTD2,"I will NEVER buy ILC season 2.  Not until Fox re-releases it, unedited.  (and maybe gives a coupon for those who had bought it.)

Anybody who's kept up on my reviews, for better or worse, would know that I find nothing worse than editing - especially when they don't bother to say on the packaging.  Television is supposed to be art.  To chop it up and remove pieces, regardless of excuse, is no better than me going to the Louvre to paint over the Mona Lisa's nose with pea green paint or, worse, an advertisement for Tootsie Rolls in the nostrils.

I'm hoping season 3 will be full and unedited.

It's a shame; the show itself was not only funny at the time; it's held MUCH of its humor that many skit or sitcom shows have managed to lose over time.  That is extremely rare, to say the least.

In Living Color is special.  A cultural influence, no less, as it remains as fresh today as it did in 1990 (unlike many other skit shows...).  To neuter it by replacing music soundtracks (while not updating the end credits either) and removing entire skits (namely the Vanilla Ice parody for no apparent reason) crosses the line.  Particularly when, as said by others, no word of the atrocity had been mentioned on the packaging!

Now if this set was $20, then I would buy it.  But not for $40.

One other note, I want to send a gigantic note of thanks to amazon.com, for being an invaluable service.  In terms of both price and especially with allowing consumer reviews, I turn to amazon.com first to find out what users have to say about new releases.",1105142400,116,1549,4.420494699646643
2114989,1,B0002PYTD2,"I'm sorry but this is not a true representation of the show in 1991.  The editing company RUINED it.  The original songs from the dances were not the same and have missing skits.
Now that TV on DVD is all the rage these days we don't deserve to pay a lot of money to have these sets so poorly altered.
Anyone wanting to buy the set to have a reminder of how it really was when it originally aired will be disappointed.
I want a refund!",1104019200,55,435,4.046511627906977
2114990,5,B0002PYTD2,"Very funny, I was laughing to the point of tears. Since this season ended with cliffhangers in the last episode you can be sure the Season 3 DVD is coming soon",1103241600,3,159,4.161290322580645
2114991,5,B0002PYTD2,There are some very good skit concepts on these shows.  I can see where alot of people have borrowed from this series.  Whenever I have a chance i'm popping in In living color for some good laughs.,1101945600,4,197,4.297297297297297
2114992,4,B0002PYTD2,"I am generally happy with my purchase of the DVD set, but I wish a few things weren't missing from it.

First of all, where's Jamie Foxx's character Wanda?  The Internet Movie Database claims Jamie joined the cast in 1991, which I thought was the second season, but correct me if I'm wrong.  Anywho, I'm not sure if Jamie Foxx joined in the second or third season, but if he did join the cast in the third season I hope they include it with the next box set.

Also as many other reviewer have stated Jim Carrey's Vanilla Ice impression is NOT on here!!!  Another one of my favorites not included.

Pretty much every other skit is included in the DVD and not much else is changed, except some minor editing to the music and clips.

All in all, a good set.  But if you're looking for Wanda or Vanilla Ice, you will be disappointed.",1101859200,13,829,4.303225806451613
2114993,5,B0002PYTD2,"The vanilia ice skit will problably be on the 3rd Season box set when it is released.  It is on an episode with all the rest of their music/comedy videos hosted by downtown julie brown. Just check it out on season 3 on episode 66.  I got the box set and it brought back fond memories.  My favorite charater on the show is David allan Grier, the man is sick.  Although I believe the show reached its peak on the 3rd and 4th seasons, and that is when Jamie Foxx came in.  They were in their prime.  This show was the best when it aired, and SNL didn't even compare.",1101081600,9,563,4.072727272727272
2115004,5,B0002PYTD2,"I bought this DVD...wrote a review 'bout it, Like to hear it..here it go...

I bought this DVD because it was funnyyy....
It's so funny it made me piss my pants despite of the editing because this is still the greatest comedy sketch show evaaaa...AHHhhhahhhhhhhh.

THANK U!!!...thank u very moch..alright na...

For the people that gave this a low rating just because of that stupid vanilla ice bit is going overboard. Theres other sketches that are way more funnier that makes up for it.",1098576000,11,488,4.785714285714286
2115005,1,B0002PYTD2,"This release should be titled, ""In Living Color: Season 2 (Edited and Modified for Your Viewing Displeasure)"". The cheapos at FOX apparently didn't want to pay for certain music rights involved in the skits so they either replaced the music or cut the skit all together (as is the case with The Jim Carrey Vanilla Ice skit). What an underhanded move by Fox. I consider this false advertising. It's not Season 2. It's MOST of Season 2, MODIFIED. I LOVE ""IN LIVING COLOR"". This review is based on this DVD RELEASE ONLY. I am very disappointed and would advise others to avoid purchasing. Maybe FOX will get the message and do a re-release, but don't hold your breath. I've really lost respect for Fox and its Home Entertainment Division. They could have, at the very least, acknowledged the modifications on the DVD packaging.",1098144000,133,824,4.769230769230769
2115006,3,B0002PYTD2,"I only bought the second season because (I saw somewhere on line that) the Jim Carrey / Vanilla Ice skit was going to be on it.  And I only bought the first season because I was buying the second season.  I don't really care as much about alot of other stuff that was edited, but I am SOOOO Mad that that Vanilla Ice

skit is not on there.  That is like the most classic skit ever!!!",1098144000,15,383,4.0
2115007,5,B0002PYTD2,"The second season of IN LIVING COLOR picks up where the first left off.  Our favorite characters return...such as Homey D. Clown, Benita Bertrell, and Ernest Tubbs.  And then...there are the new characters...the most memorable being Frenchy and the immortal Fire Marshall Bill!  This season shows the Wayans brothers hitting their stride.  The show helped to put FOX on the map, and it made for some great laughs too!  And, who could forget the guest stars!  Heavy D., Queen Latifah, and others graced the staged with some great old school jams!  So, if you haven't gotten this gem of a set...go out right now and get it!  You'll be laughing for a long time!",1097539200,6,658,4.7105263157894735
2115008,3,B0002PYTD2,This was a great show when it was on TV!!!  Why did FOX have to edit it???  I loved the end of Anton's army skit and also miss Jim Carey's Vanilla Ice impression.  RELEASE the series UNEDITED!!!!!!!  It would absolutely get 5 stars without the editing.  At least explain to us why some of the material is changed and WARN us before we buy it!!!!,1097366400,31,345,4.246153846153846
2115009,5,B0002PYTD2,"After the successful first season of In Living Color, Keenan Ivory Wayans and company started to realize that they had something... they were famous now. The show had brought them recognition. Homey D. Clown and Men On [stuff] were already household names. So now they knew that had to work hard to keep it going. And kept it going they did...

The second season is better than ever. In this box set, you get TWICE the episodes (although a couple are clip shows), and you not only see MORE Homey D. Clown (including a cliffhanger at the end) and Men On [stuff] (also includes a cliffhanger), but we also get the debut of what might be the most signature character of the series, Fire Marshall Bill, which is easily tied with Men On [stuff] for my favorite sketch(es). His appearance and dialogue are funny enough, but his ""methods"" of teaching fire safety are hysterical. ""LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHIN'..."" Also, the Brothers Brothers (AKA The Toms), as seen on one sketch in season one, get more sketches here, and thus, more character development; they're two black guys who act like corny white guys. And when Keenan as the one Tom gets mad, he yells ""DOOHICKEY! GOSH DARN IT! HECK!"" and Damon Wayans as the other Tom says ""He never talks like this!"", haha. Also introduced are the BS Brothers, two ""hip"" agent wannabes (""Ain't that a blip?"" ""BAMM!!!""), Frenchy, a goofball Rick James fan who shows up at fancy events just to embarrass someone, and Velma Mulholland, an actress from the 1940's stuck in 1990-91. Kelly Coffield did a great job with that character. How the camera made her look black and white against living color (no pun intended) I'll never know. Oh yeah, and Vera De Milo, Calhoun Tubbs, the prisoner who uses big, random words, Ceephus and Reesie (who are actually funnier this time around), Hey Mon, Anton, the Homeboys, Parnell, I Love Laquita, etc. return for more laughs.

Other noteworthy sketches: ""2 Live Crew"", ""Tag Team Evangelists"" (Jim Carrey singing the hymn cracks me up), ""Spike's Joint"", etc, etc.

If you liked Season One, you'll love this one even more. BUY IT. This is one DVD set Homey can play.",1097107200,10,2133,4.71313672922252
2115010,5,B0002PYTD2,i have been an avid veiwer of In Living Color since 1990 when it first came out. Now stright up I am going to tell you that FIRE MARSHALL BILL as played by Jim Carry is #1. He is really funny and this $ disc set DVD is Jam Packed with 500 minutes of non-stop entertainment. From Ms. Bonetia to Fire Marshall Bill and to every other skit and the guy who lives in a cardboard box. IO rate this 5 stars becasue it's unbelievable harlarious entertainment. That's the bottom line,1097020800,,474,4.21978021978022
2115011,3,B0002PYTD2,"I used to watch this show all the time while I was in middle school, when it first aired, and the thing I remember and enjoyed most about it were the spoofs of then-popular music acts. Thus, imagine my disappointment, when I bought this DVD set, and Jim Carrey's classic Vanilla Ice routine was missing (cut from episode 15). What a shame! If studios are going to cut pieces out of, or in any way alter their original shows, I feel it needs to SAY SO somewhere on the packaging. I don't want to pay $40 for a collection of shows that has been edited.

That aside, many of the other acts are great. Magenta Thompson stands out as one of the funnier sketches in this set, as are ""Men on..."", Benita Buttrell, and the random pokes at familiar commercials of the day. I noticed some picture glitches during the ""Oprah's Resteraunt"" segment, as well as ""Men on Television"", but otherwise, the image and sound is good.

Extras are limited, but overall this is a decent set of a funny, funny show. It's just a pity that any of it had to be altered, and it makes me wary about wanting to purchase any future sets of this series.",1096934400,16,1120,4.354066985645933
2115012,3,B0002PYTD2,"True fans of In Living Color will notice some differences between this season of episodes as compared to season one and the broadcast run of this series, either on Fox or reruns on FX.

One of the positives of this season is that all of these episodes are as they were when they first aired on Fox, meaning all the sketches are not like the reruns on FX when they cut and butchered the episodes and had all sorts of sketches from all five seasons of the show.  The best thing about this is that there is some material that hasn't been seen since it originally aired on Fox.

One of the most serious downfalls of this season is that the most of the original music bumpers have been removed and replaced with generic music.  I am surprised that they didn't edit out the special musical guests at the end of the shows.  I understand that they would have to pay for the music rights, but this is just sad.  They also manupliated the credits of each show, and it is VERY noticeable.

One other downside is that some of the sketches have been altered.  95% are still in tact, but in two instances I have seen where they have been altered.  One of the sketches being one where Anton Jackson goes to join the Army.  The end of the sketch was cut where he started to sing his version of the ""Be All You Can Be"" Army song.  One other instance involves a jailhouse call with Oswald.  It was supposed to be a commerical for AT&T, but they edited over the original music with some more ""upbeat"" kind of song.

Diehard fans should like this classic collection of episodes, but these suddle changes and alterations are enough to make some upset.",1096675200,17,1630,4.357615894039735
