4264278,5,B004648W0G,"We love these DVDs! We had gone to a promotional event at our local Jewish Community Center and saw one episode and loved it. They are perfect for Jews of any denomination. I love that my children are learning about Israel, holidays and Hebrew from the makers of Sesame Street and with the great characters from it! I would recommend for any Jewish family!",1318118400,,356,4.578125
4264279,3,B004648W0G,"No, I'm not happy with this Shalom Sesame venture.  They could double or triple the programs on each dvd for this price.  30 minutes-- that's it.

And the content.  I'm approaching this from a different perspective from the other reviewers.  My son already speaks/understands ivrit, and I speak what I can with him.  So, my three-year old is already WAY beyond the occasional word of Modern Hebrew they work in.  Little kids are very wired to pick up languages-- there is no need to spoon feed one or two words to them.  They need more than that-- verbs, sentence structure, usage.  (Same goes for adults ready to get on with learning a language as well, actually.)  And as for voice actors?  Yes, even the voice-overs on this program are NOT the children we see-- they are actors, Israeli, perhaps, but still not the child shown.  As we have Ethopian friends and neighbors, both Jewish and X-tian, my son isn't seeing anything he doesn't already know very well, but I do appreciate the inclusion of the Moroccan and Ethopian communities; especially as most Jews in the US don't have the extremely diverse neighborhood we live in.

I'm very very disappointed with this dvd-- so much so that smallfry may only get the Rehov Sumsum series, if another of those programs is released.  There is so much more that could have been done-- even if the budget was lower, the writing seems very formulaic, without the levels of entertainment I'm used to from Seasame Street.  Back to the Old School and Rehov Sumsum dvds.",1302048000,2,1510,4.709923664122138
4264280,5,B004648W0G,"Just in time for the Jewish holiday of Passover comes this 2010 episode of the  TV version of Sesame Street - which is called Shalom Sesame - and is produced in the US by Sesame Workshop and aimed at teaching American Jewish children about Jewish customs and the country of Israel. The show is formatted like the original PBS version(there are other SS versions around the world but this one is US based) with a general storyline for each episode but always a section on numbers and counting and the infamous ""Letter of the day"" commercials. (This time there are two: H and M. Each segment is only 2 minutes long so children don't get bored.

The plot this time has to do with the missing horseradish needed for the seder plate. Where has it gone? It's gone to the Israeli version of Oscar the Grouch. Only in Israel he is known as Moishe the Oofnik! Grover is till Grover though.

There are small section where real children - not actors - talk about the holiday including two vignettes about a Black family who resettled from Ethiopia to Israel and another family that moved from Morocco.

Most episodes of SS include a well-known actor or personality. Here it is actor Jake Gyllenhaal who can't find the hidden Afikomen (piece of matzoh).

Kids will enjoy the show but the highlight for parents - and the reason they will sit trough this show multiple times with their kids is the WONDERFUL and HILARIOUS parody of Les Misrables (the musical) - titled Les Matzarables. Sung to the tune of ""Master of the House"" from that adult musical its all about that afikomen again! ( I only wish the disc was indexed by segment so I could play this wonderful segment again and again!

This is the first of this Jewish  series that I have seen but, I'm assuming they use the same format with subjects ranging from Jewish holidays to travel around Israel.

4264281,5,B004648W0G,"This is my favorite of the 2010-2011 Shalom Sesame series and my kids love it too. The show weaves in a story where the Sesame Street characters search for the missing horseradish. Shalom Sesame Passover teaches the audience how to count to four in Hebrew, how to add numbers to equal four, and various Passover traditions.  It features an Ethiopian Jewish family celebrating Passover and Moroccan Jews celebrating Mimouna, the end of Passover.  It explains the different symbols on the Seder plate and teaches other interesting facts about the holiday.  My children have watched it close to ten times so far and they still want to watch it again and again.",1301270400,6,657,4.900900900900901

8416981,5,B004648W0G,"My two year old grandson LOVED this and we played it two days leading up to the Seder so when we had the Seder, he recognized the key vocabulary word:  AFIKOMEN!",1399507200,,161,4.193548387096774
8416982,5,B004648W0G,"In what we have come to love about Sesame Street is it's simplicity and much reinforcement.  This is a really good way to explain the meaning of the Passover/Seder meal to younger children.  It would be best for children over 4.  This was used for a Seder Celebration for children 3-4th grade.  The three year olds were lost most of the time and showed it with there actions.

One especially bright moment was where the Jewish lady convinced Oscar the Grouch to come to the Seder meal and to bring his horse radish.  The conversation was classic.

If you are Jewish or Christian and plan to celebrate either way then this is a great resource to help you explain what is happening on a child's level.",1399075200,,699,4.5
