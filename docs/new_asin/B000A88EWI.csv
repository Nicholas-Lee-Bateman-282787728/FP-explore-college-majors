8076275,3,B000A88EWI,"Kimba exists in two versions. The original version, which older fans remember, is now out in a big box set. This DVD contains the 1993 version, which has a new soundtrack with new voices and music. This 1993 version is currently being shown on some TV stations, so if you have watched Kimba on TV recently, this is probably the version you want.

There are three episodes on this particular DVD: ""Rumble in the Jungle"" (original title ""Battle at Dead River""), ""A Flood of Grasshoppers"" (original title ""Insect Invasion""), and ""Egg Hunt"" (original title ""Scrambled Eggs""). These same episodes are available on other DVDs made by Genius Products, but they were transferred properly on this Bazooka Joe DVD, and look pretty good (the other Genius DVDs of Kimba look very bad).

The packaging is strange: it has a lot about Bazooka bubblegum, but not much about the Kimba shows--not even the titles. The extras on this DVD are trivia about Bazooka bubblegum as well.",1123545600,10,962,4.859756097560975
