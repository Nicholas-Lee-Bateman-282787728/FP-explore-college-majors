7961088,5,B000065AZB,One of my favourite Fassbinder films is given a superb pressing by Criterion.,1433289600,,77,5.0
7961089,4,B000065AZB,"The consensus on this film is that it is the first Fassbinder feature to aim for Hollywood-styled melodrama - albeit, on a low budget and with some real flair in the direction.  And that he is aspiring to make films like those of Douglas Sirk.  Indeed, this is the case.

The story here has elements of nihilism, but it's encased in conventional scriptwriting and moviemaking.  It's not a masterpiece, and it's a bit of a bummer.  But it is interesting and it is imaginative.",1402963200,,475,4.607142857142857
7961090,5,B000065AZB,"This is another interesting film from Fassbinder.  However, what made this DVD so special were the two documentaries that were included.  One was"" Life, Love, and Celluloid"" and the other ""Fassbinder's Women.""  I had been looking for these when I rented The Merchant of Four Seasons.  When I found these were on the disc bought it and I'm very pleased.  I find his movies fascinating. Though they are not all excellent, all have merit.",1372291200,9,435,4.824324324324325
7961091,4,B000065AZB,"A French Foreign Legion ex-mercenary straggles to find himself back home in the Germany of the fifties.

As understood, sex explorations during business hours lead him off police, down a social leader into a manual job while his indifferent marriage was damaged even more with letting his co-legion mate to move in a family small flat.

Also not much sex (neither same gender glamour, surely) was depicted as from a contemporary movie-watching expertice at all, at the time of the producing, the sexual-revolution- seventies of the last century, these pillow scenes were, probably, quite impressive.

Bringing just problems on close, a major character drunk himself to death making an exit from a bleak life filled with problems, leaving manipulative, supportive, unloved wife and a kid with a flatmate to eventually officiate unconsumable.

For reviewing an Australian-made DVD a price tag looks over-exaggerated in spite all the drama plot and actors' professionalism.",1251763200,,970,5.403973509933775
7961092,5,B000065AZB,"Fassbinder is the Prince of Pain. In ""Merchant,""baby-faced Hans grew up with a cruel mother & driven-to-success siblings. Hans joined the foreign legion to prove himself-but got the greatest defeat of his life. Hans struggles to sell fruit in apartment courtyards (a dying trade). To sum it up: In battle, so called buddies could have helped more. In life, his wife could have helped more. In a unique Fassbinder ending both comic & melancholy,Hans loses interest in life, then ironically a woman he loves(now married)offers up a quickie (too little too late).",1121212800,7,560,5.0978260869565215
7961093,5,B000065AZB,"The prolific career of Rainer Werner Fassbinder (thirty six films in seventeen years ) reached one of the glorious peaks with that work . A fruit peddler watches his unexceptional life abrades slowly as a tragic adagio.

The creative powers of Rainer made of him the tragic memory of the Post War Germany . His talent allowed him evoke with horrid precision the timeless and small tragedies of the common people . All these films served him as the secure plataform for his mythical Berlin Alexanderplatz , some years after .

Powerful script and ensamble process . Watch once more to that supreme goddess and exceptional actress of the german cinema : Hanna Schygulla .",1095552000,5,669,4.808695652173913
7961094,5,B000065AZB,"This could be a good introduction to the terse, emotionally-layered films of Fassbinder, who is becoming recognized as having had a great impact during his short 37 years (deceased in 1982).  His films focus on human themes that transcend era or epoch.  Here we find a fruit-peddler, who, although seemingly doomed in his early forays into the world and cursed by his mother, continues to work to find meaning in his relationships with women, men, and the world of commerce.  Yet, this well-meaning man sinks further into despair and depression, as life goes on.  A poignant tale that is timeless, and as visionary today as it was the day it was released.  Very highly recommended!",1052092800,11,681,4.886956521739131
7961095,5,B000065AZB,"MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS is the deeply moving tale of a German fruit-peddler searching for love and meaning in his life. Not only was this Fassbinder's first major commercial success, it is also one of his best films, and marks a crucial turning point in his career. Stylistically it both looks back to his earlier, more abstract ""theatrical"" films (like KATZELMACHER), and ahead to his unique melodramas (MARRIAGE OF MARIA BRAUN). MERCHANT is an ideal film to begin exploring - or re-exploring - Fassbinder. Wellspring Media has created a superb ""Masterworks Edition"" DVD of the film, made from a gorgeously-restored print, with your choice of hearing either a new Dolby 5.1 soundtrack (which I recommend) or the original stereo. They also include two full-length documentaries about Fassbinder: Juliane Lorenz's 90-minute ""Life, Love & Celluloid,"" a fascinating look at Fassbinder's legacy (featuring no film clips but staged scenes, in English, from his plays, plus many revealing interviews); and Alessandro Colizzi's ""The Many Women of Fassbinder,"" which offers a good overview of Fassbinder's career - featuring extensive film clips - while deconstructing the myth of Fassbinder's ""misogyny."" There is also an insightful and entertaining optional full-length commentary track by Fassbinder's friend Wim Wenders (director of WINGS OF DESIRE, and co-founder with Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, and others, of the influential 1970s New German Cinema movement), and much more. This is an exceptional DVD release of a great film.",1028678400,32,1526,5.497872340425532
7961096,5,B000065AZB,"filmmaker of the German New Wave,Merchant of Four Seasons is a truly heartbreaking film about thesorrows of a misspent life, conducted in a beautifully joyous manner. Hirschmuller, and especially(as usual) the actresses, Irm Hermann and Hanna Schygulla, are stunning .One of Master Fassbinder's most  quietly powerful films, a study in how a great character study is to be done.",971827200,11,378,5.406779661016949
