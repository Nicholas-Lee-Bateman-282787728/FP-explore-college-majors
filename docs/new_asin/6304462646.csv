878603,2,6304462646,"I expected a bit more from a PBS production. Normally this series (""Amercian Experience"") is outstanding, I purchased some Lincoln DVDS and loved them, but I was rather disappointed with this DVD in light of the outstanding subject matter (Washington). Again, I would watch it on tv; I wouldnt buy.  Overall, nothing special.",1358380800,13,325,5.132075471698113
878604,1,6304462646,worst pbs documentary I have ever seen.  I can't say enough about it boring amateurish so bad I could not watch it all the way thru.  I watch every documentary about the American Revolution that  I can get my hands on and this one is by far the worst.,1342051200,7,251,4.081632653061225
878605,5,6304462646,"George Washington's reputation has had more ups and downs than a roller coaster at Kings Dominion, 50 miles or so from where he was born. Parson Weems and others made him a God-like figure who ""could not tell a lie."" Then the iconoclasts came along and turned Washington into a wooden figure, incompetent general, figurehead, vain poppycock, real estate speculator, etc. etc.

In the past 20 years, a more balanced and appreciative view of Washington has emerged. He may not have had the tactical brilliance of Patton, but his military leadership was crucial to our victory. He may not have had the political brilliance of Jefferson or Hamilton, but his political leadership skills, reputation, and, significantly, ability to use the talents of people like Jefferson and Hamilton, were crucial in establishing the new Republic. Maybe most important, his example and instincts were important in establishing many of our democratic principles, including the peaceful transfer of power and the supremacy of civilian leadership over the military.

This video presents the interesting -- and I think spot-on -- view that Washington started out as a striving social climber, primarily interested in his position in society and reputation. But over the course of his long political career he grew in important ways and came to realize that his reputation -- and service to his country -- would best be served by turning down the opportunity for total power. The video describes the temptations that were placed in Washington's path and his steadfast belief that the civilians -- fractious and incompetent as they were -- had to remain supreme. The video movingly describes Washington's intervention with his officers at Newburgh, when he prevented his impatient army from marching on Philadelphia to demand their back pay at the point of a bayonet. This was perhaps the most dangerous moment in our democracy's early history and one where Washington played his part supremely. Then, once the peace treaty was official, when many military heroes of the past would have demanded honors and power, Washington went to Congress, reported that he had completed the job they had given him, and begged their permission to resign his commission and return home.

Like the other reviewer, I felt it would have been nice if the video continued to tell the story of Washington's important role in the development of the Constitution and his time as president. But the video tells a strong story. Far from being a wooden figurehead, Washington emerges in this video as the essential leader of the revolutionary army as well as the revolutionary cause and the vital figure in creating many of our democratic institutions and traditions.",1317945600,8,2715,5.138009049773756
878606,3,6304462646,"This 60 minute DVD gives a partial history of George Washington, starting as a young man trying to make his way into Virginia society and ending with resigning his military commission in Annapolis.

It enables scene selections and has English subtitles. It uses pictures and historians as ` talking heads' to narrate.
It attempts an unbiased view of Washington, not presenting him as an unerring `father of our country'. He is called a land grabber and uses even his own words justifying him taking the best lands he was surveying; even lands that were meant as a reward for his soldiers. It also accuses him of being a cheap swindler, but then gives no examples or explanation...this leaves much to be desired in what is supposed to be an accurate historical portrayal.
It presents his military mistakes and triumphs and shows his growth as a person and a leader.
Probably this biggest fault I find with this, is that it is presenting the case as `the man who wouldn't be king', but yet stops with his military resignation and makes no mention of him shunning the powers and trappings of a king when he became president. That is a huge hole in the tale of what this subject should have covered.",1309996800,20,1195,4.6635071090047395
878607,1,6304462646,This was the most incorrect biography I have ever seen. It is written by a historical fictionist and is totally trying to bring Washington down. This movie was obviously an opinion. How could the author say those things about Washington. I highly recommend you don't watch it. It should not be used for children. You'll be teaching your kids incorrect things.,1127260800,2,359,4.901639344262295
878608,4,6304462646,"""George Washington - The Man Who Wouldn't Be King"" is most properly considered a psychological biography of the first President.  This American Experience episode does not cover his entire life, but begins with when he was brought to Mount Vernon by his half-brother Lawrence to learn how to be a gentleman and ends when he refuses to become the first king of the United States.  The goal is to transform Washington from a ""marble monument"" back into a human being.  What emerges is rather ironic, given that Washington was born into the Virginia aristocracy, but we see how Washington was--in terms of personality and reputation--a self-made man.
After all, this was a man who headed off to the French & Indian Wars as a Major of colonial militia having read two books on the art of war and taken fencing lessons.  The military fiasco that resulted would hardly seem to be the foundation upon which to build either a military or political career. In fact, this documentary suggests that what Washington did in the backwoods of America ultimately caused both the American and French Revolutions, both of which were inspired by higher taxes to pay for military endeavors.  The documentary argues that Washington's deepest desire was to become commissioned a British officer.  In refusing to give the colonial such rank, the British end up creating a man who would take command of an army involved in a rebellion.  In yet another irony, Washington was one of the richest men in the colonies and consumed by the a growing list of anti-Colonial discrimination by the British.
""George Washington: The Man Who Wouldn't Be King"" pays attention to both his strengths and faults of character.  Driven by ambition, Washington accumulated thousands of acres under less than noble circumstances.  Yet his favorite play was about the death of Cato, a self-sacrificing public servant.  Thus, the documentary achieves its goal, of giving viewers a better sense of the complexity of the man.  After watching this students willl have a much better idea of this man, who basically lost more military engagements than any other general in American history, and yet was the only choice for first head of the new American government.  Consequently, the psychological profile provided by this documentary does not work as an introduction to Washington, but rather works much better as a way of reconsidering the man.",1015027200,12,2394,5.017676767676767
878609,4,6304462646,"""George Washington:  the Man Who Wouldn't be King"" is more than just a one-hour biography of Washington's various careers as a planter, surveyor, soldier and president.  As important as a review of Washington's  life is, this film focuses on one of his greatest contributions to Amercian  democracy:  his steadfast refusal to declare himself king at the end of the  American Revolution.
This film uses personal journals and newspaper  accounts to illustrate Washington's life and his complexities as a leader  and as a man.  While the film probably doesn't tell us much we don't  already know about Washington's life and political career, it does put into  dramatic context, the ease with which Washington could have assumed  dictatorial control of a willing nation.  The American Republic is so much  taken for granted today, that we tend to forget that self-rule was an  untried concept, and that Washington was so trusted and revered, many  pivotal leaders would have eagerly enthroned him if he had allowed it.  If  Washington did nothing else to be remembered for in his life, then he will  be rememembered for allowing the American Experiment to continue.  This  film underscores this point beautifully.",958867200,9,1209,5.160621761658031

7871467,3,6304462646,"Although this DVD gives many good and accurate stories and such of Washington, it also sneaks in MANY little Anti-Hero ""zingers"" to try to take away honor from this great man.

ONE of them that really stands out is the idiot ""historian"" who although admitting that Washington refused to take over as a ""king"" or worse, a dictator, states that Washington's reason for NOT becoming king was that he ONLY worried about what he would be thought of later on in History.

It gives NONE of the credit for him being an honorable man to his morals, only his desire to be thought well of in the future.

Impressionable people, especially the youth, who haven't studied Washington would come out with an overall idea that Washington was a worthless ""dirt-bag"".",1372723200,13,749,4.746153846153846

7871469,1,6304462646,"The 'historians' used ""I think"" or ""I believe"" numerous times.  In the first minute there are three statements that are not accurate.  The early theme of the video seems to only go back to the statements by W.E. Woodward in his book ""A New American History"".  The early premise of the video is not supported by the history prior to Woodward's book.

As the video continues it does become more accurate although the authors do include more personal ""I think""s.
