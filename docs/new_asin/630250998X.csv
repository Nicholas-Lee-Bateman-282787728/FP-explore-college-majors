475800,5,630250998X,"Fine horror gem starring Peter Lorre doing what he does best: scaring the daylights out of viewers by going over the deep end into madness. He plays a doctor who is in love with Frances Drake, who in turn is married to concert pianist Colin Clive. When Clive loses his hands in a train accident, Lorre gives him new ones - that once belonged to a murderer who specialized in knife-throwing (an idea copied later most memorably in BLACK FRIDAY). Lorre schemes to get rid of Clive by killing Clive's stepfather with a knife and then getting Clive to believe he was the one who did it. It comes close to working, but Drake interferes and when Lorre attempts to strangle her, Clive saves his wife by, yep, tossing a knife right into Lorre. Lorre is perfect in his role, and when he finally snaps and goes into that hysterical laughter - wow! But Drake and Clive are excellent, too, and everything about the production, from the script to the editing, is done with care. Definitely worth a watch.",1149292800,2,991,4.5418994413407825
475801,4,630250998X,"This movie is a strange one.  Some of the acting is bad, the premise of the story is pretty far out in left field, and Ted Healy's attempt at comedy is irritating.  But this is quibbling.  The whole movie is no more or no less than a stellar performance by Peter Lorre.  His mad Dr. Gogol is one of the most over the top performances ever seen.
Yes, this movie is a strange one, but for a Lorre fan, a must-see!  Recommended!",1061596800,3,425,4.134146341463414

Lorre later turns her into a waxwork image to be worshipped, serenaded on the piano, and read poetry to in the privacy of his own weird home...This is by far the best of many versions and variants of Maurice Renard's novel LES MAINS d'ORLAC. Karl Freund, the master cinematographer who won himself an AA for THE GOOD EARTH in 1938, is, however, no more at ease direction-wise than he was making THE MUMMY three years prior.

475803,4,630250998X,"Dr. Gogol is a somewhat bizarre, but brilliant surgeon who is obsessed with the beautiful actress Yvonne.  He goes night after night to see her perform in a Grand Guignol-style performance as a victim of sadistic  torture.  When the theatre is closing for the season, he is upset to hear  that Yvonne is not returning as she is married and will be joining her  husband.  He is able to purchase a wax likeness of her from the theatre and  this he keeps and fantasizes over, speaking to it as if it were alive.  Yvonne's husband, the famed pianist Stephen Orlac is injured in a train  accident and his hands are crushed.  Yvonne, wary of Dr. Gogol's  attentions, but knowing of his reputation as a surgeon, asks him to help  her husband.  Dr. Gogol, anxious to do anything to keep the object of his  desire close by, agrees.  He grafts the hands of the recently guillotined  knife-throwing murderer Rollo onto Stephen Orlac.  After recovering,  Stephen finds that he cannot play the paino as he used to, but his hands do  have the ability to wield a kinfe with deadly accuracy, and they seem to  have a mind of their own!  With bills for therapies piling up, Yvonne and  Stephen's life seems to be falling apart.  Dr. Gogol sees this as a chance  to make Yvonne his own. Peter Lorre gives a stellar turn in this role.  We  are truly able to see his character's descent into madness.  Director Karl  Freund's expressionist style makes every frame interesting to look at.  Some of the comic relief is a bit over the top, especially the batty maid,  but overall a great film, well worth a look.",949363200,4,1589,4.531914893617022
7826996,5,630250998X,"Peter Lorre is a master of horror films, and this one is no exception. It is great. He plays an insane well-known surgeon in France, Dr. Gogol, in this science-fiction horror black and white 1935 film. He is passionately but madly in love with an actress called Orlac. Her husband is a well-known pianist. Orlac knows that Lorre/Gogol is in love with her. He had rented a box at the theater for over forty nights and came to see her act every night. She discovers that her husband has been in a train accident and his hands have been smashed and she wants to repair the loss
.
She requests Gogol to save his hands. Gogol cannot do that because her husband's hands were smashed. He does not tell the husband and wife that he removed the smashed hands and substituted the hands of a killer who had just been guillotined. When the pianist husband recovers, his hands are no longer able to play the piano as he did previously, but like the now dead murderer who committed his murder by throwing a knife, his hands cause the husband to throw knives. When Orlac rejects Gogols love saying she loves her husband, he decides to find a way to have her husband killed.

Viewers who enjoy horror films will really delight with this one.",1509408000,,1225,4.46875

who loses his hand in accident and the doctor replaces them with the hands of a killer who try to take over his body. Lorre is perfect
as the 'mad' doctor and with his shaved head and those eyes just give him that 'mad' look that only Lorre could play. Drake is attractive
but she gives the same performance as in Invisible Ray which I think she over acts too much. Clive doesn't seem like the perfect choice
for this role but as he did in Frankenstein he gives a hell of a performance. He seems like a man who really has a killer's hands. The
writing and directing move the picture along nicely and the ending is very well done. This is more than just a HORROR movie it's a
love story with some horror but not bloody or gory. This is a forgotten classic that needs a bigger audience.",1429401600,,915,4.264367816091954

 MAD LOVE (1935) with Peter Lorre, a creepy (if far-fetched) story where he's a doctor who, for the love of an actress married to a concert pianist, sews a pair of hands onto her husband after his are crushed in a train wreck. The hands however belonged to a just-executed knife murderer, and now the musician can't control them from doing what comes naturally.

A real creepfest, this is just one of Lorre's many impassioned perfomances.
Directed by cinematographer Karl Freund, who's best known as inventor of the three camera technique for television.

""Mad Love"" suffers from MGM's post-production tampering, excessive comic relief and weird miscasting (Edward Brophy as a condemned knife-throwing murderer!), but manages to sustain its disturbing atmosphere.

7827001,4,630250998X,"""Mad Love"" (aka ""The Hands of Orlac"") is a 1935 black and white horror film from MGM in an attempt to counter the popularity of Universal's horror films (""Frankenstein"", ""Dracula"", ""The Mummy"", ""The Invisible Man""). Peter Lorre plays a mad doctor, Colin Clive plays a man whose hands may not be his own, and Frances Drake plays the women they both love. The film is a remake of the 1924 version starring Conrad Veidt.

Peter Lorre (1904-64) gained prominence as the child molester in Fritz Lang's ""M"" (1931) and went on to fame as ""Mr. Moto"" in a series of 8 detective films between 1937 and 1939. This is his American film debut, in which he appears bald, and he is at his creepy best.

Colin Clive (1900-37) will forever be remembered as Dr. Frankenstein from the Universal classic films of 1931 and 1935. Unfortunately he died in 1937 as a result of alcoholism and TB, and his appearance in this film shows how much he changed from 1931. FWIW - Peter Lorre was a pallbearer at the funeral.

Lovely Frances Drake (1912-2000) is best known for her role as Eponine in ""Les Miserables"" (1935). Her acting career was cut short by her marriage to a British aristocrat in 1939.

Comedy pioneer Ted Healy (1896-1937) appears as a reporter. Healy is best known as the creator of The 3 Stooges.

Keye Luke (1904-1991) has a small part as Lorre's assistant. We know Luke best from the TV series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-5) in which he played Master Po (the blind Priest). Luke did more than 100 films and as many TV shows. He was Charlie Chan's #1 son in Warner Oland's film series in the 30s.

Also look for Ed Brophy (1895-1960) as Rollo the Knife Thrower. Brophy's small round body appeared in dozens of films, usually as a gangster. I liked him best in ""The Last Gangster"" (1937). And in a brief role, watch for Henry Brandon (1912-90) who plays Clive's father. Brandon is best known as the villainous Barnaby from Laurel and Hardy's ""Babes in Toyland"" (1934). And finally there's famous comedian Billy Gilbert (1894-1971) as a passenger on a train.

This was the last film as a director for Karl Freund (1890-1969) who went on to devote himself to cinematography and won an Oscar for ""The Good Earth"" (1937) and has the distinction of being nominated twice in a single year (1941) for a color (""Blossoms in the Dust"") and a black & white (""The Chocolate Soldier"") film. Freund worked with German expressionists F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang and filmed such classics as ""Golem"" (1920), ""The Last Laugh"" (1924), and ""Metropolis"" (1927). His other film credits include ""Dracula"" (1931), ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" (1932), and ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1940). It was Freund who developed the 3-camera film shooting introduced in the TV series ""I Love Lucy"" which became the standard for all TV shows ever since. This was his American film debut.

Legendary Gregg Toland (1904-48) is the cinematographer. Toland was nominated for 6 Oscars and won for ""Wuthering Heights"" (1939). His most famous work is ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), but he lost the Oscar to Arthur Miller (""How Green was my Valley"").

The film shows heavy influences of the German expressionist movement with themes borrowed from ""Frankenstein"" (1931), ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" (1933) and ""Phantom of the Opera"" (1925). In many respects it represents an early film noir, telling the tale of the downfall of the well-intended doctor.

There are several attempts at humor, including Healy's reporter and a drunken housekeeper played by Sara Haden (1899-1981), but generally speaking they only detract from the main plot.

1935 was a good year for films. ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and ""The Informer"" were box office and Oscar winners. Other top 10 grossing films included Gable and Harlow in ""China Seas"", Flynn and de Havilland in ""Captain Blood"", Shirley Temple in ""The Littlest Rebel"" and ""Curly Top"", and Greta Garbo in ""Anna Karenina"". Other notable films released that year included ""Alice Adams"" with Hepburn, ""The 39 Steps"", ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", ""David Copperfield"", ""A Tale of Two Cities"", ""Les Miserables"", ""Top Hat"", and ""A Night at the Opera"". In Germany, Leni Riefenstahl released ""Triumph of the Will"".

The NY Times called Lorre ""brilliant"" but referred to the film as  ""not much more than a super-Karloff melodrama, an interesting but pretty trivial adventure in Grand Guignol horror.""

Bottom line - an interesting look at an early film noir with a compelling performance from Peter Lorre.",1339027200,,4450,4.869047619047619

7827003,4,630250998X,"Peter Lorre's bald, creepy looks as ""Dr. Gogol"" are memorable in this film. Just look at the cover of this VHS!

The story is fairly interesting with a few twists, although a bit far-fetched and a little corny in spots. Then again, it is 70 years old.

The black-and-white cinematography is very good in parts. I really liked the closeups on Lorre and the shadows in the hallway. Frances Drake is a pretty woman except for those weird eyebrows, the style of the day, unfortunately.

I saw this on a fair-to-poor quality tape. I imagine this looks pretty good on DVD and I'd like to see it again now that it's out on that format.",1237161600,,628,4.443478260869565
7827004,3,630250998X,"Mad Love (Karl Freund, 1935)

While Karl Freund is one of classic cinema's greatest cinematographers (he's best known today, probably, for being the guy placing the cameras for I Love Lucy), he did get behind the camera and direct every now and again. Ten times, to be exact, of which only one remains well-known today-- the Boris Karloff hit The Mummy. Mad Love, Freund's final film as a director, is to be blunt nowhere near the level of The Mummy, but it certainly has its moments.

Adapted from Maurice Renard's potboiler The Hands of Orlac, Mad Love is the story of Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre) and his all-consuming love for stage actress Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake). Yvonne's husband, Stephen (Colin Clive), is a famous concert pianist. Gogol, however, is unaware Stephen exists, and thinking Yvonne single, he pursues her until she mentions she's married. Not a good thing where an obsession is concerned. Gogol resigns himself to a life of loneliness, contenting himself with a wax figure of Yvonne that had stood in the theater, until a train wreck mangles Stephen's hands and Yvonne calls on Gogol to save him. Other doctors have said Stephen's hands were beyond saving, but Gogol, who attended the execution of the murderer Rollo (Edward Brophy) that morning, has a sudden flash of inspiration: a hand transplant. It's a success, with one exception: Stephen's new hands have kept the proclivities of their former owner.

This is fun stuff indeed, though the script could have used a bit of polishing (the climactic scene is unintentionally hysterical more than once); Lorre and Drake are two great tastes that taste great together, and Clive (The Bride of Frankenstein) makes a great milksop. (In both looks and-- at least in this movie-- temperament, he seems to have been the Bill Pullman of the thirties.) There is excellent comic relief to be had in the form of Gogol's constantly-drunk housekeeper and the dogged reporter who woos her as a way to find out what Gogol did with Rollo's body after it was shipped to him. It is, in most respects, a fine film, and one well worth watching. Just get ready to cringe when Peter Lorre starts that last monologue. ***",1201046400,,2171,4.846361185983827
7827005,4,630250998X,"Brilliant surgeon Dr Gogol is in `mad love' with actress Yvonne Orlac. Night after night he watches her performance in a Grand Guignol production where he almost passes out with ecstasy during her torture scenes. Clearly insane, Gogol's final decent into madness is exacerbated by the news that Yvonne is retiring from acting to tour with her genius pianist husband Stephen.

  Gogol's evenings are spent lamenting his loss with a waxwork replica of the actress; regaling it with declarations of love and piano sonatas.

  When Stephen Orlacs hands are severed in a train smash, Yvonne goes to Gogol for help. Gogol acquires the hands of a recently executed maniac and grafts them on to the stricken musician with questionable success. What Stephen now lacks in musical dexterity is more than made up for by a murderous rage and deadly knife throwing abilities. After a row with his father, Stephen is blamed for murdering him. Gogol seizes his chance to frame Stephen and vent his `mad love'.

  An almost forgotten classic, Mad Love is a creaky expressionist chiller based on Maurice Renard's `Les Main D'Orlac' (The Hands of Orlac) and was directed by shadow-miester Karl Freund who later went on to direct The Mummy and lens `greatest movie ever made `Citizen Kane.

  Mad Love is a fairytale of the darkest timbre, but its main thrust about creepy limb transplants is totally derailed by Lorre's murderously `lost in love' Dr Gogol. With his baby smooth skin and bulging eyes Gogol is a bizarre arrangement of ping pong balls and reptilian charm. His whining whispery voice seems to slither around you until it finds a suitable opening in your clothing - or worse - your skin! Mad Love was Lorre's first major role in the states having established himself in Germany with the Fritz Lang classic `M'. Here Lorre turns in an early example of his unhinged outsider shtick - and although he acts everybody else off the screen - it's no great stretch when you consider that here he's playing opposite the likes of `Frankenstein's Colin Clive who, as always, displayed more ham than Fray Bentos.

  Mad Love is a Tim Burton film before there was Tim Burton. The scene in which Gogol disguises himself as the resurrected killer in surgical braces and artificial limbs to convince Stephen that he's responsible for his father's murder is as jarring an image of abject revulsion ever committed to celluloid - the diabolical offspring of Humpty Dumpty and Edward Scissor Hands.

  During a film course I attended in Brighton a few years ago legendary film maker Jack Cardiff related the tale of Peter Lorre's `dying' on the set of a film he was directing and then suddenly coming back to life and asking for directions for the nearest bar whilst being given his last rites. Lorre's life was a litany of persecution, (a Hungarian Jew - he had to flee the holocaust) typecasting (forever tagged as the worlds greatest `Peter Lorre type' actor) and morphine addiction. Whatever the source of Lorre's demons, it can't ever be said that he didn't make those demons work for him. Mad Love alone is testament to that.
