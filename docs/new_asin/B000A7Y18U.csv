Drescher, the devotee now serving a life sentence for carrying out Kirtanananda's order for those murders. The book is available on Amazon or through the website: [...] .Drescher has written a highly literary memoir and has the advantage of a behind-the-scene look at what went on: the reasons for the murders, the primary actors, the prevalent atmosphere at New Vrindaban that contributed to the murders and a highly interesting profile of Kirtanananda, warts and all. While the factors that contributed to New Vrindaban's crash from the transcendental world are varied and complex, Drescher fills in the gaps the movie has left for the viewer and also provides a psychological profile of the author's PTSD, acquired while a grunt in the US Army in Viet Nam during the tumultuous 1960's. A good read for anyone interested in the culture of war during the Viet Nam war.",1372982400,,1154,5.715116279069767

as of late have a hurried fast-food quality to them.  As long as the product is out, it doesn't seem to
matter that the substance is lacking.
  This film remindes me of the high-end works that PBS used to show.  It's quite apparent that Mr. Young
took the time to make this incredible documentary about this Hare Krishna splinter group and its arrogant,
fanatical leader.  The fact that the filmmaker was able to interview Kirtananda Swami Bahktipada during the trials, right up to his ultimate downfall, was nothing short of amazing!
  However, when I did some research about this documentary, I couldn't really find any information about it.
The only thing that I was able to find out was a brief synopsis of the film.  No record of film awards, or reviews.  This is a shame.
  HOLY COW SWAMI is an exceptional documentary that I, quite frankly, enjoyed more than some of the bigger documentaries being backed by big movie companies like FARENHEIT 911.  It's certainly far superior to much of the junk that passes as documentaries that are being screened on cable at this time.

Do yourself a favor-See it!",1208736000,3,1302,4.801801801801802
8076074,5,B000A7Y18U,"This is a great documentary, if you have any interest in the Hare Krishnas, fringe religious groups, religious freedom, group dynamics, life philosophy, or issues of authority. Along with the books ""Betrayal of the Spirit"" and ""Monkey on a Stick,"" this indie movie provides the best insight into the dark underbelly within the Hare Krishna movement.

The subject of the documentary, Swami Bhaktipad, claimed guruhood, as a pure devotee of God and spiritual master. Hundreds of people followed him absolutely at the isolated farm/commune he created near Moundsville WV. The documentary interviews Bhaktipad himself, his devotees, former devotees who rejected his authority, prosecuters who considered him a racketeer, and lawyers who considered him religiously persecuted.

I'm left with the impression that Bhaktipad was indeed a meglomanic, and guilty of some grievous crimes, but the prosecution of him was religiously motivated. Kind of like OJ: sometimes the police frame someone who really is guilty!

Though the movie deals with issues of life and death and ultimate meaning, it's done with a light touch, with the director clearly aware of the almost comic absurdity of a man claiming to be the supreme representative of God getting caught with his pants down, metaphorically and ultimately literally.

When you have someone who claims to be an ultimate spiritual authority, and people willing to cling to the hope that he really is, no matter what evidence contradicts it... it truly points to the greatest questions of life. Who's the real authority? What should we believe? How should we act? What is Good and Bad?",1159315200,3,1624,5.258687258687258
