174655,5,0988187469,"To this day, I'm still a little unclear how the producers managed to get permission to make an official adaptation of Jack Chick's infamous anti-gaming propaganda track, but I was thrilled with the result. It's somewhat difficult to classify: they work in a lot of comedy, but this isn't a parody. It simultaneously illustrates the utter absurdity of the source material while still revealing a love for that absurdity.

The quality of the movie is extremely impressive, particularly given the movie's budget. The effects were silly and clearly inexpensive, but - like most great low-budget productions - they managed to turn this from a weakness to a strength by utilizing them to their fullest.

The actors, all of them fantastic, deliver their lines with a mixture of sincerity and camp. The characters are either astonishingly true to the original comic or re-imagined in ways that added layers of humor to the premise. Ms. Frost is particularly impressive: the comic's least grounded character is brought to life completely. The other two leads, Debbie and Marcie, were likewise fantastic. I also found Nitro, a new character, a lot of fun. I could easily keep going - the cast was universally great.

I find it difficult to imagine anyone with a D&D background not appreciating the finished project. As promised, it's a faithful adaptation of Chick's work, albeit one with a bit more comedy than Jack might have wanted.",1425945600,15,1425,5.029661016949152

They got Chick's permission to adapt his tract for their movie as long as they portray it straight. Fortunately, Chick's work inherently spoofs itself. If you grew up playing Dungeons and Dragons and turned out relatively well-adjusted, a little more literate, and had to deal with the religious hysteria and condemnation of the game, then this movie is for you.

The acting is solid, the production values are good despite a small budget. A thoroughly enjoyable film that is part of the history of table-top RPG (or role playing games) and Dungeons and Dragons in particular (although D&D is not referenced, probably for copyright issues).

174661,4,0988187469,"I was curious whether this was serious or not. After watching it, it's pretty clear that it is not. From people involved in ""The Gamers"" (so, not anti-RPG sorts, to say the least) franchise being in it, to just the tone, the even more absurd than Chick idea of an RPG illuminati, and the almost fourth wall-breaking moments, everything points pretty clearly to heavy-handed satire.

That's not a criticism, as the source material is not exactly subtle, either, and is so absurd I can kinda see why some people don't get the satire.

But everyone who still isn't convinced should have a close read at the kickstarter page. The subtext is pretty clear. And it's hilarious but not unexpected that Jack Chick and/or his people, if he has any, didn't see it.

The original comic strip is slightly disturbing in its stupidity and hate, but also hilarious (side note, when I was first playing D&D at 13, I had a friend with very Christian parents who only let him play if he promised to only play clerics, of God. Jack Chick would have found that ridiculousness dangerously sinful.). This interpretation of it captures the camp very well. It's a very good comedy, playing toward the strengths of its low budget perfectly.

Though the two complaints are the kickstarter stretch goals (I wasn't a backer, I just found them researching this) promising Cthulhu and a musical number. Cthulhu's there, but feels very shoehorned in and like it was just checking a box; thrown in to have a stretch goal. And I was disappointed it was in the form of bad CGI instead of a guy in a bad costume. That would've been far funnier, in my opinion. And the musical number is over the credits and gets cut off before finishing. But is amusing.

But the whole first half of the movie I spent laughing uproariously. I definitely like it. And I especially love picturing Jack Chick's face as he realized what he's done and that his soul may be damned to hell for allowing his work of righteousness to be corrupted. If he ever did. He may be oblivious enough not to.

And seriously people, satire. Look it up.",1485302400,9,2079,4.62059620596206
174662,1,0988187469,"This is a fundamentalist christian programming video thinly disguised as something else. At the time, It was aimed squarely at impressionable teenagers brought forth from an ideology that equated RPG games to devil worship and suicide. There were no hidden gems or easter eggs in this, it was specifically designed to play at gatherings of impressionable audiences and scare them into believing the party line. There's really nothing funny about this, and it has a very mean spirited underlying theme.

Girls would rarely play - it was largely a 'boys only' club, though we really wished more girls would notice us. 3. Miniatures, when used, were never destroyed by the Dungeon Master because they were lead and were meticulously painted. 4. Any gamer who gets as deeply into the games as these girls do is usually kicked out of games because they are too far gone.

For those who don't remember the tracts they were cartoons designed to warn people against sinful things and direct them to Jesus. Sinful things in Chick's world meant darn near anything including other Christian groups he disagreed with. The Dark Dungeons tract told of the evil of role playing games and how they were a recruitment tool for the Satanic evil doers who lurked around every corner in the 80s. Don't laugh. In the 80s a lot of people really believed that crap. This movie takes the often unintentionally comical tract and turns it up to eleven. If you are a fan of ""the Gamers"" series of films.

174680,5,0988187469,"This film caused a spiritual awakening in me.

I'm only linking to them so you know to avoid them.

If you aren't moved by this film then you're likely dead inside and are probably into the RPGs too deep.

On a serious note, I do have to say that this film was extremely well done. You can tell that it's an indie production, but the acting is superb. What really sells this film is that while it's clearly not meant to be taken seriously, the cast and script are played straight. The thing about Chick Tracts is that they tend to never require anything to make fun of them since they so frequently lampoon themselves with the over the top content and preaching. It's hard to take a Chick Tract seriously when they're telling you that RPGs will lead you straight to Hell, after all. The special effects are also impressive given the minuscule budget and I can see why this is steadily developing a cult following on the Internet.

So should you buy this? Absolutely. The price may seem a lot to pay for what's ultimately a short film, but it's well worth it. Hopefully at some point in the future the directors will make the content available as a download somewhere outside of their personal website so it can be downloaded via other avenues.",1451606400,3,1737,5.402214022140221

Yes, all the actors play it completely straight. But that's the point. Chick and company truly, honestly believe that role playing is demonic, Cthulhu is real, cult conspiracies abound, CS Lewis (noted Christian writer) is part of the problem, and you can become a born-again Christian in two seconds if you just renounce it all...how could anybody satirize that? It's all too insane. So they played it straight, with so much campy enthusiasm that you can see the nonsense for what it is and laugh hysterically.

Maybe it helps that I did LARP for a while as a teen and know how ridiculous the premise is. Just look at the first RPG scene: college kids do not stop drinking and hooking up at a party to sit around and watch other people play D&D! And then there's the LARP scene: one of the first rules of LARPing, per the rule books, is no touching and no weapons. But I'm sure Chick never cracked open a role-playing book. (Facts weren't exactly his favorite things anyway.) The dungeon mistress chews up the scenery like she's in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, the two female leads have lesbian subtext as subtle as a brick wall, the good holy Christians who save Debbie appear on screen for about a minute and leave zero impact...

What about the message? Well, as with most other authors, there are things I strongly agree with, things I strongly disagree with, and things that I am simply not sure about. As to the film, I really enjoyed it because it is very entertaining and, at the same time, allows the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions about the validity of the message. By the way, Chick was heavily influenced by the fantasy writing of CS Lewis. ""A Demons Nightmare"", an early Chick booklet, was basically a cartoon version of The Screwtape Letters, a fantasy novel by Lewis. The Next Step, an early graphic novel by Chick, also contains Lewis material. So the command to burn the works of Lewis and JRR Tolkein in the film and the first edition of the booklet is ironic and may show that Chick was intentionally sending a mixed message. After all, his own work was full of the occult. At the same time, his basic message of salvation through the finished work of Jesus on the cross (Lewis and Tolkein also shared this same basic message) is clearly presented. The film captures this.",1495584000,3,1319,4.641025641025641
