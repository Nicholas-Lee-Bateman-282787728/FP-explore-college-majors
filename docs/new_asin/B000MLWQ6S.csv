2736849,5,B000MLWQ6S,"I don't understand the pricing of these shows. Why should season 3 be almost $20.00 MORE than season 4?

Someone explain it to me, please.

I love the show but these prices are outrageous. I understand the whole ""rights"" issues with the music, but how does this justify the difference in price with the other three seasons?

I don't get it.

2736852,4,B000MLWQ6S,"Someone else left a review of most of the other episodes, but there was one I liked. Red Tape. In order not to be next on the casuality list, Tubbs leaves Vice (sort of) and discovers who is leaking information to various crime bosses protecting their assests from nosy law enforcement investigators. I loved the music in this Episode. It had alot of star power in it too. Lou Diamond Phillips, Annette Benning, Viggo Mortensen. Wow!",1169942400,12,433,4.7105263157894735
2736853,5,B000MLWQ6S,"ok, they are taking forever with these sets.  anyway, its finally here.  i think season two was the best season overall, but season three had some of the best episodes;  unfortunately, it had some pretty bad ones as well.  here's the quick and dirty on each episode:

When irish eyes are crying:  the season premier episode.  i was a little let down after the spectacular season premier of season 2 (the prodigal son).  this is a very good episode though with liam neeson as the IRA terrorist.  also, an important episode because crockett gets his ferrari blown up (its a classic mv moment; the expression on crocket's face lol)

stone's war:  the stone eps are always good.  crocket's reporter friend from viet nam returns to try and take down g. gordon liddy (yea, good luck with that pal!)

kill shot:  a ho-hum episode about an impotent jai alai player who gets black mailed by drug dealers.  nothing to write home about...

walk alone:  ok, one of the best episodes of mv, imho.  tubbs has to go undercover in a prison to get the guys that killed his girlfriend in a club.  larry fishburne plays a guard.  great music in this one and one of the more brutal eps of mv...

the good collar: a ho hum episode again.  crockett identifies with a star football player that gets caught up in the drug world. nuthin' special...

shadow in the dark: ok, again one of my fav. eps.  dark, moody, dreamlike and strange.  a cat burgler goes after people's pants and ear-rings and freaks crockett and a detective out as they both try to develop the mindset of the cat burgler to catch him.  GREAT scene with castillo and crockett sitting in a coffee shop together :)

el viejo: i really like this episode featuring willie nielson. has bon jovi song, wanted, dead or alive and flies on the windscreen by depache mode. also features the little reservior dogs geek, steve buscimi.  great music, action and plot...

better living through chemistry: i really like this ep too in which tubbs' old partner comes back from NY for a little revenge on tubbs. a genius chemist figures out how to synthesize cocaine.  hummm, all they need is a guina pig now. hey, is that izzie??

baby blues:  ok, this ep [...].  something about a black market for babies and a dirty lawyer.  i only watched it maybe twice, when i've watched the other eps many, many times...

streetwise: another [...] ep featuring the clown that can't act from tombstone (bill paxton).  about an undercover cop who is in love with a hooker. this can't end well...

down for the count: sad, dreery 2 part ep. in which zito is killed.  didn't really care for these eps and didn't like to see zito go :(

the savage: i like this episode about an assassin and his handler that have been brought in to take out a communist sympathizer.  crockett and castillo find some help from an old viet nam friend who was trying to track down the assassin in nam.  Michael wright is great as the assassin who has a nasty habit of killing hookers along with his ""legit"" i.e., ""sanctioned"" targets.  good music and ending...

theresa: crockett's dr. girlfriend (helena bonham carter) is also a junkie.  too bad for you crockett! she compromises his case and i.a. goes after crockett, thinking he's dirty.  he has to prove himself by taking down brad dourif! a good ep

an afternoon plane: ok, really good ep. in which calderon's son, john leguizmo, comes back to get a little revenge by tricking tubbs and his new lady (also a dr.) to stay on an island that has no guns on it.  good music and good acting in an ep in which tubbs takes on 3 stone killers. but why did tubbs' girl think she could help with that??

lend me an ear:  great ep.  has the song, lend me an ear by the waterboys.  crockett and tubbs try to put surveillance on a money launderer and enlist the help of a free-lance bug-guy, who, unfortunately, plays both sides of the fence...

by hooker or by crook:  interesting ep. featuring melanie griffith and george takie. melanie is a heidi fliess type madame and crockett uses her to go after sulu.  she comes to his boat to tell him what a [...] he is. a decent ep...

viking bikers from hell: ahh, one of my all time fav eps featuring a lot of great new mv music.  crockett and tubbs track down, with the help of izzie, the leader of a motorcycle gang who is seeking revenge against the person who took out his friend.  he uses the, um, process of elimination to make sure he gets his man.  tubbs gets shot in this ep...

everybody's in showbiz:  i kinda liked this ep. about a guy sonny put in the clink but who happens to be an artist (writes plays and acts in them).  the guy steals a briefcase from a crack dealer and apparently, the crack dealer's entire business is in the briefcase.  needless to say, he's not amused.  kind of a funny ending as crockett and tubbs get duped...

heroes in the revolution: WTF?!?! where did this s#$) come from?  something about gina's mom and a revolution. one of the worst mvs in my opinion...

ok, i left out a couple eps, so sue me.  maybe someone could fill in the gaps.  anyway, now that i look back on that season, i realize it had a few of my favorite all time eps.  the bad episodes bring the season down a little though.  hope this guide was helpful to you pal!",1169596800,70,5255,4.436058700209643

2736858,3,B000MLWQ6S,"Season three was different. It was different from the lighthearted pastiche of 80s pop (and drug) culture that were the first two seasons. The show took on a more serious tone, stories became darker, the humor was noticeably scaled back, and so were the bright pastels from earlier episodes. The music selection also saw a departure from a colorful collection of 80s rock and pop music to bleak, dark, gritty guitar rock.

Arguably, this alone caused many people who had become fans of the show during its first two seasons to turn away again. It was probably difficult to accept that Miami was no longer portrayed as the hedonistic, pastel-colored tropical seacoast paradise where the criminal living was easy between palm trees, million dollar mansions and luxury yachts and sports cars.

Yes, as some have rightly pointed out, season three features some of the best stories. Episodes like ""Killshot"", ""Red Tape"" or ""El Viejo"" were at the height of no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners 1980s drama. The acting in episodes like these was good, plot twists were fitting, and you felt well entertained. But still, there was just something about this third season that didn't quite feel right. It's one thing to concede that as fashion trends change, so can the look and production of a television show that has fashion so engrained in its DNA. In some sort of ironic synchronicity of events.

But what was done with season 3 was more or less that many of the elements of the two earlier seasons that had made them such a mass phenomenon and overarching television hit were thrown out and replaced by an experimental shift in tone and concept which ultimately fell through with the public. Season 3 was a turning point, it was when the show began its long and painful decline, which saw Miami Vice, this hot new show which was once way ahead of the curve, increasingly fall behind the curve, to the point where it couldn't even see the curve anymore. Its magic was lost forever, and many attempts to regain its former mojo only made things much worse until it sank into obscurity even before its little-witnessed series finale in season 5.

Buy this box set, enjoy the good episodes, shrug off the increasing amount of bad episodes towards the season's end. Just don't expect season 3 to be anywhere near as good and colorful and a time capsule of 80s pop culture as the two previous seasons.",1467417600,,2384,4.793187347931873

2736880,5,B000MLWQ6S,"The best thing about revisiting the Miami Vice era, besides reminding me of my youth, was seeing the real genius of Michal Mann and his single biggest asset (besides Philip Michael Thomas, Don Johnson and Edward James Olmos), was the [then] revolutionary music of Jan Hammer, who was given a fully edited, complete episode every week -- sent to his studio/home in Europe -- which he then wrote the music entirely for in just a few days, then shot it back. This went on for all 111 episodes of the six season life of what was probably the closest thing to the real Miami in the post Cuban boat lift era, and established both production style and dress styles (at least for Miami) that are with us to this day. At 48 minutes of actual content, it is also a sad reminder of how SCREWED the American TV goer is getting these days, where only 20% of the air time was commercials, instead of what has now become 33% (40 minutes content and 20 minutes commercials). Michael Mann has always been a pioneer of mixing full length great soundtracks to scenes, with an effortless and innate instinct for what fits the moment and the mood, and Miami Vice is a classic example, thanks to Jan Hammer equally intuitive artistic insight to what Mann wanted. This series MADE many stars SUPER stars in the music world, and EVERYONE in the music world stood in line to contribute or play a part in whatever episode each Miami Vice proposed. Every ""cop"" show of today, is but a shadow to the influence of production, sound and action first pioneered on Miami Vice.",1433203200,3,1544,4.537634408602151

Don's Sonny has a dry sense of humor besides being so darn pretty.  This season has my 2 favorites.  Willie Nelson's Texas Ranger gives me chills every time.  After garbage like ""Honeysuckle Rose"" he owed us.

Does anyone else wonder why the writers always hooked poor Sonny up w/ugly women?  Some just hard on the eyes/one had some real eyebrow problems & Katlin's proportioned all wrong plus stole my mother's hairdo. (not being hateful to imperfect ladies - I'm certainly not perfect).  Caroline was pretty enough, but whinny & such a nag.

In Season 3 - Sonny finally gets a beauty between the linens.  Long forgotten (not all that forgotten?) sparks fly between Don & Melanie.  They are still good together...

I was a little apprehensive about getting the third season on disc but the price was right so I went for it. Most episodes aren't bad. There are SO many guest stars that would later become much more famous. There was an episode with Viggo Mortenson (who would later be a lead in ""The Lord of the Rings"") in a very small part of a show opener for example. Seriously, it's fun watching all the stars and figuring out how many years later til they got famous. I think the reason I hesitated was, among other things, that this was the end of the Daytona. I think that episode may have been the turning point in the series for me. The white Testarossa just never did it for me.

I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen it but I don't hear anybody complaining about it so maybe the producers were right.  The only thing that makes any sense was that this was meant to air as the 1st episode but for some reason did not.  Still - very weird!

However I am not knocking the episode (in fact it was a nice surprise).  Miami Vice was - and remains - one of the very best television series ever produced.  I really miss the show airing on Friday nights - there was no reason to go out on Friday nights during those days because the best entertainment was right at home on TV.  What a wonderful time it was to watch Miami Vice when it was new!  It still remains my personal favorite series of all time.  The third season takes a little getting used to - Crockett and Tubbs new hair styles - darker clothes, darker music - but a much brighter car.  Personally I miss the black Daytona Spyder (even if it wasn't a complete true Ferrari - who cares? - it looked cool).  Too bad the Testarossa isn't a convertible.

Tubbs gets some strong storylines, and there is an ep. devoted to Castillo and some ghosts from his past.
The Vice team also loses one of its own, in one of the saddest and most memorable scenes.
But it's Sonny Crockett who suffers the most blows to his ego and his soul, with Internal Affairs trumping up charges against him, to a judge who jails him for not revealing an informant's name, to the death of said informant, to the storyline in which Crockett gets a man out of prison because he believes him to be innocent but then finds out, too late, that he was guilty all along; to two failed romances with women who turn out to be, respectively, a drug addict and a high-powered madame.
There are some great songs, as always, and Sonny's new Ferrari Testarossa is a thing of beauty.

2736947,4,B000MLWQ6S,"This 1986-87 Season of this police drama about these sock-free cops was awesome & takes me back to memory lane to when it was a popular Friday night show on NBC & to when I was 14 years old in the 8th grade back then.

MIAMI VICE's 3rd Season also takes me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Come Home To NBC"", which was NBC's credo from the Fall of 1986 thru the Summer of 1987.

This was also the first full season with Crockett's snazzy white Ferrari Testerosa too which was more upgraded than Crockett's black Ferrari used in the first 2 Seasons of MIAMI VICE.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Willie Nelson in the ""El Viejo"" episode

*Wesley Snipes in the ""Street Wise"" episode before he became a star

*Boxing promoter Don King doing a cameo appearance in the ""Down For The Count"" episode

*George Takei in the ""By Hooker, By Crook"" episode after his co-starring days on STAR TREK

*Ismael ""East"" Carlo in the ""Cuba Libre"" episode during his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA & DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Lou Diamond Phillips & Melanie Griffith in the ""Red Tape"" episode

*Wrestler Lou Albano in the ""By Hooker By Crook"" episode

*Former football celebrity John Matuszak in the ""Viking Bikers From Hell""

*Laurence Fishburne in the ""Walk Alone"" episode before he became a star

*Don Johnson's ex-wife(Melanie Griffith)in the ""By Hooker By Crook"" episode

It was also neat being able to watch these episodes complete & uncut as well as commercial-free as opposed to how they were shown in reruns on USA, FX, TNN, and TV Land which edited each episode by deleting too many scenes to allot more time for too many commercial disruptions.

It's just too bad Universal decided not to provide the original air-dates to each episode like they did with the first 2 seasons of MIAMI VICE

2736951,5,B000MLWQ6S,"Miami Vice Season 3 took a darker turn, not just in terms of tone, but also in style.  While Season 2 began the shift toward more serious storylines, Season 3 coupled the dark storylines with a darker tone.  The bright colors, and general sense of style was toned down in favor of more real stories.  This tactic worked in making the show better, in that you concentrated on the stories more than what they were wearing, or what music was playing.  In this, it really was the best season of Miami Vice yet.  The stories used some clever then current events, the IRA conflict, fake adoptions based on kidnaped children, and the corrupt prison system.  There was also a lot of episodes that worked on establishing the Miami Vice world, including the change in automobiles, the death of a major (and some would say favorite) character, as well as another episode in the Calderone Saga (an episode that seems very much a tribute to high noon).

I've reviewed other seasons and noted that I never watched this show while it was on TV, as it was far before my time.  But I must say the show holds up surprisingly well, and I hope the improvements from season to season carry on.  Either way, this season is a classic, and full of entertaining episodes.  If you liked the first two seasons, you should give this a try.",1256256000,2,1311,4.516949152542373
2736952,4,B000MLWQ6S,"The third season of Miami Vice appeared during the fall of 1986 in a new time slot, which apparently caused a dip in the ratings due to direct competition with Dallas.  However, the show had gained a head of steam by that point.

The show seems to take a darker turn in this season, in the style and subject matter departments.  Many endings add a cynical twist as the duo deal with contemporary events like US activity in Nicaragua, the burgeoning fascination with criminal psychology, the rise of synthetic street drugs, and even terrorism.  Corruption abounds as they enter a prison to expose and shut down a criminal operation run by the warden himself, or watch one of their own break down from blackmail.  The vice squad even loses a member in a memorable two-parter.  There are a lot of gun battles, too, with Crockett blowing away a slew of bad guys with his trusty pistol, which always sounded like the Dirty Harry gun.  How many times did he have to go in front of the 'shooting board'?  It should be every single episode---these guys are involved in more shootings than entire metro departments.

As others have noted, the look of the show changed, too, from the pastels of 1984 to darker hues to match the subject matter.  And the haircuts have changed with Crockett sporting a very '86 spiky 'do.  And yes, the 'fake' Ferrari Daytona Spyder is blown to smithereens in the great season opener (by an ultra-sleazy gun dealer played by Jeff Fahey) and replaced by the white Testarossa.

And the guest appearances...has any other show had so many then-famous and soon-to-be-famous people appear?  Doubtful.  Among the familiar faces this time around are Liam Neeson, Lou Diamond Philips, Viggo Mortensen, Benecio Del Toro, John Glover, Sonny Landham (round about the time he appeared as Billy in Predator ), Lawrence Fishburne, the late John Matuszak of Raiders fame, Annette Benning, Vincent D'Onofrio, Wesley Snipes, Bill Paxton, G. Gordon Liddy (again), Bob Balaban (also again), Ron Perlman, Charles S. Dutton, Willie Nelson, and the guy who played the principal in the Breakfast Club.  And...in one single episode you have Melanie Griffith, Vanity, Captain Lou Albano, and George Takei(!)

Highly recommended.  This was a very good show that hit perhaps its best stride during the third season.  There are very few weak episodes, and some very classic ones.  Shadow In The Dark is like Manhunter-lite and appeared that same year by Michael Mann.  Stone's War dealt with current events of the day in Nicaragua.  Walk Alone featured Tubbs going overcover in prison, and getting bailed out by rear-whooping Castillo.  This really was 'TV Noir', with Hollywood-level production values on a TV show.  Though often remembered only for the style (white jackets, rolled up sleeves, Ray Bans), Miami Vice also gave us a lot of cop-show clich&eacute;s that writers still can't escape from.  As always, Jan Hammer's music is a perfect supplement, particularly when he does that ominous chord when something bad happens (Baaaaaaaarrrr---rrrourrrr...you get the point).  One of the reasons the show took so long to appear on DVD is because all of the rights clearing for the (many, many) songs used...they're all here and intact.",1246320000,4,3230,4.981343283582089

2736955,5,B000MLWQ6S,"I was a big fan of ""Vice"" when it originally aired, and twenty plus years later, I think a lot of it holds up well.  Season 3 is probably my favorite, darker, more complex, and moodier than the first two.  In my opinion, ""Shadow in the Dark"" is one of the best episodes in the entire series.  I agree with the reviewer who noted Don Johnson's dated clothes (those short jackets with all the zippers and buttons in sorbet colors are among the more unfortunate choices), and have noticed that his style is much more timeless (white or beige linen and pastel t-shirts) in seasons 1 and 2.  My one big beef in this collection is with the ""By Hooker By Crook"" episode which featured Melanie Griffith, and which was the subject of controversy in the press because of how it pushed the envelope in terms of what was permissible to show at the time.  NBC edited the re-run of the episode, cutting by almost half the pivotal sex scene/prostitute murder, and inexplicably they decided to issue the DVD with the edited version.  I can understand the cuts in 1987, but what harm would there have been in re-issuing the complete episode on the DVD?  After all, it's twenty years later, and the unedited scene really implies more than it shows and seems almost quaint by today's standards  (the murder was more graphic in the original, and the sex scene was longer).  All in all, this is a very worthwhile purchase for fans of the show, but it's disappointing that they didn't issue all the episodes as they originally aired.",1229990400,7,1511,4.566666666666666

2736959,5,B000MLWQ6S,"Too bad so many people stopped watching this show in time for the third season. They missed out! Seems to me VICE only became less popular just because it wasn't new anymore. But actually, it was new: the show took on a darker tone and look. The scripts became tighter, too. Standouts include 'Stone's War,' 'Streetwise,' 'By Hooker, By Crook,' 'Walk Alone,' 'Red Tape,' 'The Good Collar,' and 'Shadow in the Dark.' This was also the season in which Zito was killed off due to John Diehl's desire to try his hand at film roles.

The music has a bit less emphasis on hit songs, but there's still a lot of hit music throughout. At any rate, you can't just have music and cameo appearances. Season 3 of MIAMI VICE also has better pacing and writing than the previous season. Unfortunately, by Season 3, it had become a fad. So to those of you who thought the show was washed up already: you can have your opinions, but I say different!!!

I got this DVD box set much sooner than I expected. I'm still waiting on a different box set I ordered two weeks ago from a private seller. I also like that, so far, I only saw the Universal logo at the beginning of the disc, and not also at the start of each and every episode.

2736960,4,B000MLWQ6S,"This season was a sort of transition phase of the show, they ditched the whole STYLE aspect of the show, or were trying something new. Michael Mann was on his way out, and they brought in Law And Order mogul Dick Wolf. I think his approach to Vice added to the show, but also took away from it at the same time. Gone were the days of pastel colours, and fun episodes, and in it's place were more serious episodes, and no recurring storylines.

They ended season 2 with the episode Sons And Lovers, which focused around Calderone's daughter Angelina, who Tubbs had a relationship with, she has Tubbs' baby, and her brother vows revenge on Tubbs, and supposedly the baby and Angelina get killed in the crossfire. It was a bit of a cliffhanger in my eyes, but the season premiere of season 3 has no mention of any previous characters or storylines. They do end up tying up the loose end with Calderone's son in an episode called The Afternoon Plane which was somewhat of a dissapointment.

They get rid of the beautiful Black Ferrari Daytona Spyder in episode 2, which in this set is episode 1 (Episode 1 is really El Viejo) and they replace it with a Ferrari Testarossa. I find that the season starts off really boring, but once ya get to about the 3rd episode if you start with El Viejo as the season opener, then it starts to get good.

This season, since it is a bit of a transition period is really hit and miss. They have a good 4-5 episodes, then a few bad ones, then a few good ones, and so on. I find season 4 is a lot more consistent, but Season 3 has some really good episodes. 2 episodes that immediately come to mind are the intense WALK ALONE, where Tubbs goes undercover in a prison, and my personal favourite episode would have to be SHADOW IN THE DARK, which features an eery score from Jan Hammer, and is about a night stalker that breaks into peoples houses. The whole episode is eery, which was fitting that it was originally aired on Halloween.

Another great episode was the 2 parter Down For The Count. I won't spoil this episode, but it has to be seen. It's a great episode. I find the season premiere and season finale in this season really are boring.

Another thing I found weird about this season is the picture at times is really overly bright, or blurry because of some cheesy effect that they used at the time to make it look dreamy, from what I heard. I find it outright annoying. The 5.1 mix though is an awesome touch.

I will give this episode a 4 out of 5 stars, just because the season was hit and miss.",1197417600,4,2537,4.319327731092437
2736961,5,B000MLWQ6S,"Could this be the best season of all? Certainly that is a possibility. This season is a perfect example that made ""Miami Vice"" much more than just a cop show, this season raised many political issues and corruption issues as well. The troublespots of the world and Western government involvement with criminals often block the Vice team from doing their job, be it US mercenaries in Nicaragua, the Northern Ireland conflict, corrupt FBI agents or whatever else. Among the best episodes are ""El Viejo"" with Willie Nelson, ""When Irish eyes are crying"", ""Walk alone"", ""Killshot"", ""Heroes of the revolution"" and ""Theresa"" although every episode here is very good to standout. No episodes like ""Florence, Italy"", ""The big thaw"" or ""Miracle man"" in this season - only 100% Miami Vice at its best.

2736963,5,B000MLWQ6S,"Excellent season....To critics of the show who say it was not a gritty show then watch this season.....Excellent mix of grittiness and style..The show took on a much darker edge but did not stray from its roots......Don Johnson's clothes went from pastels and white sportcoats to mostly darker toned clothes, and the white Testarossa was introduced....Bye bye to Zito who was killed off midseason (no loss there)
Some episodes are truly classics (the opener with Jeff Fahey as a weapons distributor) the episode guest starring Lou Diamond Philipps as a cop, and a classic with John Glover as a former cop who is a surveillance sweeper (by the far funniest and least gritty episode of the season-straight out of a season 1 episode) Classic season..Only negative is Don Johnson's clothes are much more dated than in any other season....The white coats and pastels can still pass today, but the yellow shirts with blue sport coats look was out by 1988...",1185580800,3,951,4.95
2736964,4,B000MLWQ6S,"I'm glad that they finally produced seasons three, four, and five.  Season three was one of the best, if not THE best, out of all of them.  But what I don't like is that the DVD makers strayed away a little bit from the format that they did in the DVDs for seasons one and two.  One thing that was GREAT in the Season One and Two DVD sets is that in the option for English subtitles or captions, whenever a song was played during a scene, the words and lyrics of that song would ALSO show.  As part of the captions.  But instead of sticking to that cool feature, the geniuses who finally put the seasons three to five DVDs together, decided to omit that lovely cool thing, which is a departure that I don't like at all, cuz in Season Three especially there were specific episodes that I WANTED to know the precise lyrics of certain song tracks.  A little more clearly.  And I was glad to hear that the Season Three Miami Vice DVD set finally came out.  And one reason was I wanted to see the words of a few cool songs in Season Three episodes.  With the captions option.  Captions are still possible, but for some silly reason, when songs are played during scenes, the words don't nicely show up on the screen for that. Like they did in the Seasons 1 and 2 DVD sets.  THAT'S ONE LOUSY CHANGE NOW IN THE FORMATTING OF IT !!  Not a good idea.  Probably a bit of laziness on the part of the engineers or video editors or whatever.  Hence why only 4 stars instead of 5.  At least part of the reason.  (Because I'm rating the DVD formats and sets themselves too.  Not just the episodes.)
Also, I actually preferred when the disks were two-sided, as in Seasons one and two DVDs.  Anyway, another reason 4 stars instead of 5 is, while I like Miami Vice overall, sometimes, let's be totally honest, the violence, gun killings, etc, are a bit gratuitous and non-credible.  At certain times.  But what can you do?  Even if all those near escapes and constant near misses, and some of the gun things are a bit over-done here and there, which they are sometimes, the total picture needs to be appreciated and understood.  Those are two crazy under-cover cops.  And fun and passionate.  And also deep, in certain ways.  And at least are not really corrupt and crooked.  Like the sickos on ""The Shield"". (Even though the subject matter and drama on ""The Shield"" are pretty realistic and with good acting.)  But nothing's perfect.  Not even Miami Vice.  Anyway, overall though, Don Johnson's hair and apparel and style are great.  Drama and dialogue interesting and thought-provoking.  Philip Michael Thomas is always in cool and sharp form.  Edward James Olmos is always intense, sharp, and great in his speech and suave cool demeanor.  Supporting cast really good.  Scenery and imagery, topics.  Nice stuff.  Overall.  Not perfect, but interesting and cool basically, in the overall sense.  Again though, the DVDs themselves, were made differently than in seasons one and two, for some oddball reason.  They should have stuck to that original format, in the DVD sets, instead of changing it in seasons 3 to 5.  But you take the good with the bad.  So overall, pretty good.",1183766400,4,3159,4.539964476021314

2736969,5,B000MLWQ6S,"I am new with this show since I never watched it in the 80's since I was pretty young. I bought the first 2 seasons and I thought they were cool and sexy but didn't make me say ""that was awesome"". They were sometimes cool yet cheesey. This season however is 100% cool with great stories, great drama and top notch car chases and shoot-outs. There's even so many appearances by well known actors that it's hard to list them all.

  You have Wesley Snipes as a pimp, Bill Paxton as an undercover cop, Helen Bohen Carter as a doctor Crockett is dating who just happens to do drugs behind his back, Steve Buscemi, Charles S. Dutton, Willy Nelson, Liam Neeson, Viggo Mortensen, Benicio Del Toro and Brad Dourif. There's also drama when a member of their team dies. Larry is killed by boxing promoters while undercover as a boxer/trainer and it's made to look like a drug overdose. Crockett and Tubbs have to clear his name so he's not remembered as a junky. Forget the new movie, it's lame and dead in the water next to how entertaining and well done the show is.",1176595200,21,1058,4.415384615384616
2736970,5,B000MLWQ6S,I think I like this season much more than than season 2. The only thing at the time I can truly find out of sort is the fact they didn't format the episodes in chronilogical order. The episode El Viejo is placed on the second disc (i believe is the second disc) of which comes after the episode showing how Crockett lost his black car (before he gets the Testerosa). In all honest I believe that episode was accidently left out of season 2. But in spite of that little minor detail I believe that anyone who buys Seasons 3 and 4 won't be sorry.,1175644800,6,544,4.190476190476191

There's not a single bad episode on it. Every episode is great. I loved 3 on video, and now it's incredibly greater on dvd. The one and only time Vice was perfect was 3! Forget, the other seasons. The picture is fantastic and the sound isn't muffled and there are no defects. It's like the saying goes. The third time is the charm! That can't be more true for 3!

2736972,3,B000MLWQ6S,"Overall I like Season 3.  There were some improvements and some disappointments.  The positives are that they got rid of the stupid Universal logo at the beginning of every episode on the previous boxsets.  The music in 5.1 Surround is excellent.  I have a home theatre system that I play it in, and it's great!.  Universal finally wised up and got rid of the double-sided easily scratchable discs.  The only downside is that they got rid of the episode summaries after you select the episodes. This season was darker than seasons 1&2, though it still had some good episodes.  If you're a fan, buy it.",1174694400,12,601,4.666666666666667

8169899,5,B000MLWQ6S,"""Miami Vice"" was not only one of the best police dramas of the Eighties, it was one of the most memorable shows of any genre in the decade.  The show became a huge hit in its second season, and remained strong in Season Threethis DVD set contains all 24 episodes of the third season that originally aired on NBC from September 1986 to May 1987.

Vice detectives Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) and Rico Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) teamed up to solve crimes including murder, home invasion, drugs, kidnapping, prostitution, and painkiller addiction this season.  The series was groundbreaking in that it integrated music with drama as no other show previously had, and some of the acts providing the soundtrack to this season's episodes included The Who, Bon Jovi, Depeche Mode, Steppenwolf, Peter Gabriel, Billy Idol, Bob Seger, Jefferson Airplane, and Simply Red.

""Miami Vice"" is remembered for its Eighties fashion and cars, and also brilliantly used the city and scenes from surrounding South Florida as a backdrop for the actionthis season one episode is devoted to jai alai, which is perhaps more popular in Florida than in any other state.  Recognizable guest stars in Season Three include G. Gordon Liddy, Willie Nelson, Don King, George Takei, and John Matuszak.

Despite continued strong writing and solid episodes, the show began to tail off rapidly in popularity in Season Three.  There was a departure from the cast at mid-season, and Gen X parents thinking of introducing their children to one of the best shows of their era should recall that ""Miami Vice"" is violent even for a show of its type.  The window of popularity for ""Miami Vice"" was short, but at its peak it was culturally iconic and contributed one of maybe the best five theme songs in television history.",1522972800,,1782,4.936454849498328
