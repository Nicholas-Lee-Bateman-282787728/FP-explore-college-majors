I liked the story and the subtext of redemption was a plus.  What it lacked in budget it made up in story telling.  I recommend it.",1209945600,4,298,4.345454545454546
2930376,1,B000V53C0O,"This is not the worst piece of dung i have ever seen, but it's pretty darn close. If you enjoyed Night of the living dead in 3d, than this movie is for you. Of course that would make you a tasteless dullard who is easily entertained. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY! It is only because people buy this crap that crap like this will continue being made. This does not help the Zombie genre.
How does a freshly killed person have the face of a long dead (poorly made up demon looking face) corpse? Why do all the zombies have the same looking face? Ok, i guess it's a result of the bio-chemical agent in their bloodstream fine. BUT WHY DOES'NT IT AFFECT THE REST OF THEIR BODIES!?!?!?
Their are some hot chicks in this garbage movie, but no nudity.
The special affects are terrible and any character who could be somewhat interesting (with the right dialogue) is quickly killed in lame fashion.
The plot? LOL. It's so absurd i wouldn't believe it if i hadn't seen it with my own thoroughly punished eyes.
Long story short, a government agent kills off a whole American neighborhood and INTENTIONALLY risks the lives of his Duaghter and a man he treated like the Son he never had to test a bio-chemical weapon. Why? Because too many Americans die in wartime. The best part of this movie was when this tool screams out in anger ""AMERICAN LIVES""! I guess he only cares about Americans when they're overseas.
They can keep my money just give me my wasted time back.
I wish i didn't have to give at least one star.",1206835200,3,1498,4.431159420289855

Set aside the budgetary limitations and pick up this gem.  I laughed, I thrilled and I wondered what would happen next.  I was thoroughly entertained but the multiple plots and the renegade priest with a dark and deadly past.  What a pleasant surprize.

2930379,3,B000V53C0O,"Not bad, not bad at all...

1) ACTING: For a low budget, no-name indie production, the acting was pretty good. The three main characters seemed very real to me and the script seem to flesh out their characters. There were, of course, the usual hit and misses when it comes to indie productions and quality actors, but nothing that really distracted me from the film.

2) PRODUCTION: The script, I felt, was pretty strong. There were many plot lines going, and luckily for the viewer, they are all wrapped up at the end. A number of scenes were filmed with that grainy texture look which I personally do not care for, but to each his own. There was an original score by an actual band! How unusual for an indie! Normally, we, the viewers get some heavy metal music blaring through certain scenes, and this was a nice change of pace. I did have an issue with the sound. While viewing this movie, I was constantly adjusting the volume up and down. At times, I could hardly hear the actors, and then suddenly ZOMBIE ATTACK! and I was blown out of my chair. The zombie make up and gore was pretty good, but I felt, it could have /should have been more.

3) THE ZOMBIES: Really nothing new brought to the zombie genre here.

4) THE CAUSE: Experimental virus that transforms the living into the living dead.

5) NUDITY: None.

Overall, I feel that this was a pretty good entry for the low budget indie scene. Normally, we get the usual ""Zombies attack, the heroes fight to survive, and maybe, it's over."" This movie had a lot plot to keep you, the viewer interested in the movie. Is this movie top of the line, top notch zombie fare? No, there are a few problems, but nothing too extreme to take away from the viewer being entertained by this movie. And, it is WAY above the usual low budget indie crap that is normally pushed on us, the zombie genre's biggest fans.

2930395,1,B000V53C0O,"Given the proliferation of low-budget zombie flicks, I sometimes take the plunge just for the ""wake-up call"", i.e., the reminder that even allowing for the widest possible taste among viewers, entertaining movies are still hard to create. Alternatively, once in a while, I find a new story or film technique that makes the time expenditure rewarding even if the movie is deplorable. Over the years, I have stumbled upon shoe-string budget train wrecks and needle-in-a-haystack astonishing successes. Unfortunately, this one tends to the former.

With Indie productions, I lower my expectations and do my best to forgive flaws... whether they be special effects, technical, script or acting. Bringing any movie to fruition (even a poor one) requires effort, resources, vision and guts. In that vein, I hope the folks behind this movie learn from the experience and develop more worthwhile offerings. For example, a low-budget zombie movie that delivered was Exit Humanity: A Zombie Saga. I have no problem recommending that one to fans of the zombie genre. An example in the vampire/zombie crossover field would be Stake Land... again, a decent romp for the price.

So, back to Awaken the Dead... the film technique was annoyingly grainy, monochromatic and video-like. Since Blair Witch, the ""realistic"" style of filming has gained popularity, but it's definitely hit or miss on the viewer. This was not a handheld camcorder as in Blair Witch, but it didn't feel far off that mark. While the three main characters had varying levels of acting talent (I enjoyed odd moments of good performance from Gary Kohn as the conflicted Priest and Nate Witty as the nave Jehovah's Witness), they were unable to rise above their flawed surroundings. Similarly, the plot had potential in the early going, but rapidly died in clich&eacute; Hell... and don't get me started on the bad zombie make-up/action effects.

There are probably those among you that love the zombie category enough to view every single movie, no matter how painful. Fair enough, have at it... and of course, opinions do vary, so perhaps there are also adventurous viewers who would be more forgiving than my take.

On my Indie rating scale this one gets 1.5 stars...",1369094400,5,2224,5.101648351648351

2930397,1,B000V53C0O,"<strong>Awaken the Dead</strong> (Jeffrey McMichael Brookshire, 2007)

<em>Awaken the Dead</em> is a movie with an interesting premise, a script that would have been mediocire given one or two more rewrites with a professional editor sitting in, and some of the worst execution you are likely to ever see in a movie unless you go hunting for the bottom of the barrel like I do. There's really very little to do here but shake your head sadly and wait for a (hopefully loose) remake, since Hollywood eventually remakes everything these days.

Plot: Father Gideon (<em>Almost Famous</em>' Gary Kohn) is sent a message by an old employer asking him to go to their old meeting place and wait. When he does, he finds himself confronted by Mary (<em>Chronicles of a Love Unfound</em>'s Lindsey Morris in her screen debut), who lives there, and who received a similar note telling him to wait--for what, neither is sure. The two of them are interrupted, first by a pair of door-to-door religioius proselytizers, then by a thug (<em>Be Cool</em>'s Will Harris) who has a mysterious connection to Mary--but that is before the world goes insane. The inhabitants of the town, which was sprayed by a mysterious plane we see not long into the film, turn into zombies, etc. You know where to go from here. Stanley (<em>Steampunk Samurai Biker Chick</em>'s Nate Witty), once of the Jehovah's Witnesses, pops back up on their doorstep with news of the outside world, and the three of them form an uneasy alliance aimed at figuring out what's going on--and where Jeremiah (<em>The Last Bad Neighborhood</em>'s Michael Robert Nyman), Gideon's former employer, got off to instead of showing up at the house.

I keep trying to come up with ways to make this pretty, and I just can't. You know from the second Gabriel and Mary (and aren't those names subtle?) are put together in that adversarial relationship that there's going to be a (badly-filmed) love scene. From the first time you see the two Asian schoolgirl zombies hanging around in the front yard while Grin's sitting in his car outside the house, you know where that scene is going. Etc. Characters suddenly appear out of (pretty much) nowhere and for no apparent reason, plot devices appear, shimmer briefly, and then fade into nothing, the actors seem as if they've been told to be as emotionaless as possible, and I think it was all filmed on a PXL-2000 that was (badly) jury-rigged to get some semblance of washed-out color. And yet underneath its bland, pale exterior it seems as if there was really something that could have come out of this, the brilliant fat kid stuck in the skinny wallflower's body. If only someone had figured out a way to feed this movie a few brownies. *",1347235200,2,2725,4.843347639484978

However, no one should ever pay money for this. It should not be available to buy.

The script is straight out of a bad 1990s comic-book. The directing is amateurish. The acting is amateurish.  Although I will admit Lindsey Morris is hot. Her hips are amazing!) The camera-work is bad and the quality of the recording is barely watchable. It was all a dirty washed-out brown. You couldn't even see everything you were meant to.

The fun of the horror flick is the classically flawed acting...this is social, personal, government intrigue taken tongue in cheek.

2930415,1,B000V53C0O,"Indeed, that was the real foe in this low-budget, easily forgettable film.  I am very forgiving when it comes to bad acting, but the famale lead who played Mary went about and beyond the call of duty to cinch the worst actress imaginable award.  For the first five minutes after she appears, she does nothing but swear and spit nonsense in this nasally, gravelly voice.  Add a priest with no substance whatsoever, and a bubble-headed Jehova's Witness and you experience what happens when writers commit the cardinal sin of creating non-sympathetic characters whose fates you are comepletely apathetic towards.  The film is shot terribly in bleak black and white for the most part with this annoying techno music playing throughout most of it.  Every cliche' possible is mined here:  the siege in the house, the ""insider"" infected who later turns, the ridiculous metaphysical musing about whether or not this is divine retribution, the warm-hearted human protagonist and the cold as nails partner.....the hits just keep missing.

The zombies were a mix of okay looking ones and cheeseball.. So why give this move five stars you may ask? Because it was funny as hell.. The main chatacter was a priest with a shady past, and the guy who plays him looks like a Hugh Jackman reject. In fact, this priest character is very much portrayed as a Wolverine type of guy.. He's a good guy now, but had a dark past and was an assassin.. He snarls like Jackman when he finally becomes all kick axe in the movie and is even refered to as a killing machine..lol.. It was like Priesterine, meets an angry prositute, meets a Jehovah's Witness, meets the cheeseball living dead, meets Days Of Our Lives. The whole movie just had a soap opera feel to it, and someohow remined me of a Days Of Our Lives episode as well. In fact, I could see the guy who played the Priest gracing the set of Days quite nicely.. The story does not come together well at all.. it's full of holes, crappy acting, grainy quality filming and Wolverine rip offs.. My head spins to think how some reviews said this was a good story and the characters seemed real, because neither was true in my book.. And the zombie action was not that great and not that much at times.. So again, why five stars???? Because I went to bed laughing and woke up the same way, with hysterical scenes of this movie playing through my head. I also walked away from this flick with a few good cheesey lines to say to family memebers and friends..

Quick-moving scenes of violence are done in a disorienting stroboscopic and/or multi-image effect that's most effective. Heavy metal soundtrack alternates with contrasting segments of orchestral score.

Touches of black humor work nicely; tension and a sense of foreboding build nicely. One drawback is the early performance of Lindsay Morris, who annoys every time she speaks, or rather yells at the other non-monster characters. But that edginess of delivery is temporary.

There's enough moments of pure terror to keep things interesting  Gary Kohn's ex-assassin-turned-priest-turned avanging angel is most entertaining, yet how can he be expected to hold off dozens of zombies with two pistols? This scene is a real highlight of the story. Lowlights are when things stop to flesh out character back stories or for in-fighting among them. Gratefully these scenes aren't numerous.
