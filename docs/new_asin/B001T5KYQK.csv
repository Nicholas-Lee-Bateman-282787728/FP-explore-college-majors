8340619,3,B001T5KYQK,"I got this because James Franco was in it, wrote it and directed. Well, this one you could pass on.",1396569600,,99,4.0
8340620,4,B001T5KYQK,"The other reviewers are correct and I would have given it 5 stars except that there are drug induced hazy scenes that were somewhat disturbing.  Adam, the older brother and doctor character is the one who seems more troubled than the younger Max because he's more stressed and desperate at times.  He's a new doctor in practice at a hospital but can't deal with the stresses - not so much the patients but the chief physician so he steals prescription meds right from the hospital.

Max's character really is just into escapism and having a good time, hence the title.",1312848000,4,568,4.66
8340621,5,B001T5KYQK,James Franco directs and stars in this little known movie. It's an interesting story of two genius brothers who choose very different paths for thier lives. Max (James Franco) tries to escape his drug dealing past with the help of his surgeon brother Adam. Things don't go as planned. This is an entertaining movie about the bonds of brothers that has a little bit of a twist at the end. Highly recommended!,1308960000,3,407,4.666666666666667
8340622,4,B001T5KYQK,"Watched ""Good Time Max"" via STARZ and enjoyed it. I am a recent devotee to the world of James Franco films after seeing him on James Lipton's Inside the Actor's Studio last year.  Very poised and intelligent person.
There is a hint of edginess in how the film was directed which I found to be refreshing (after all, there are only so many ultra polished and finely tuned films I can stomach without retching).
This is a personal story of two brothers who are bright; they appear at first to go on different paths but it is an illusion. We see a small glimpse of their inner jealousies and competition as boys. The oldest brother goes to medical school, bonds with mom and step-father/mom's boyfriend, and gives the facade of the gifted, scholarly son, while the youngest brother (Max) cruises through life doing drugs and outwardly pretending his life is OK. While Max can score a job almost effortlessly with his wits and charm, he can't keep it for long since he is not discreet about his addiction. In the meantime, oldest brother Adam is overwhelmed with the pressure of his chosen vocation and begins taking prescription drugs to cope. Adam is found out and loses his medical license just as Max starts getting his life together. In the end, we see the brothers really do have similar struggles to deal with and they will conquer their demons together. (Ahhhh).

I was touched at the end of the film when the caption read: ""for my brother"".",1301529600,,1445,4.640625
8340623,5,B001T5KYQK,"The actor that plays Adam in this film is named Matt Bell, he is amazing. What other movies has he done? Two thumbs up for this flim!!!!!",1297382400,,137,4.111111111111111
8340624,5,B001T5KYQK,James Franco gives and excellent performance playing a bad boy/nerd junkie/drug dealer. A must for any fan. You will not be disappointed!,1289606400,4,137,5.2727272727272725
