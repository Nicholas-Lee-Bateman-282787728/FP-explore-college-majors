Now, regarding the documentary itself...  For a film that deals with energy and industry, there were an inordinate number of sociologists and non-scientists weighing in, yet speaking with presumptuous scientific authority.  Of the actual men of science, I groaned out loud when Dr. James Hansen of NASA was featured.  He is nothing more than a global warming...er, sorry...now it's ""climate change"" hack and an embarrassment to NASA.  Over the years he has repeatedly and shamefully put forward fraudulent data to support the theories of Al Gore and assorted climate fear-mongers.  He is not a credible witness.

In fact, ""climate change/global warming"" was continually referenced throughout the film as if it were established scientific fact.  This is in complete disregard for the data proving that the earth has actually COOLED during the last ten year period beginning in 1998.  Look it up.

Nowhere in the film did I hear mention of the tremendous reserves of both oil and natural gas that we have on this continent alone, be it off-shore or in Rocky Mountain shale.  (And what of the vast amounts of petroleum discovered offshore near Brazil?) U.S. government bans on drilling, recent cancellation of large numbers of oil leases, and environmental lobby disruption of nuclear development are no excuses.

I did however agree with the total skepticism and derision with which the film treated bio-fuels.  Vast amounts of U.S. forests have been cleared in hopes of cashing in on this government boondoggle.  Food prices have risen sharply in the modern world, and ever more severe famine threatens the Third.  As mentioned in the film, it requires more energy to create and make available bio-fuels than results from their use.  This is similar to the experience of Spain, where it was discovered that two jobs were lost in the creation of each ""green"" job.

All in all, too many of the film's talking points have already been disproved or called into question.  It is simply well produced propaganda.",1245542400,,2211,5.07202216066482

This is a great film except it's already been done many times before. It uses the same format of expert talking heads giving scary choice quotes about the end of the world nigh due to peak oil, global warming etc.. with stock photos of cars stuck in traffic. This one is better quality all around because of the director and guest commentators. It doesn't get too fixated on just the peak oil hobby horse but ranges more broadly including things like cycles of history and over complexity in society. It was made in 2008 when oil prices were very high and most everyone seems to make reference to it - which now that prices have dropped, is less compelling, perhaps tragically so. In any case, I enjoy these types of films because there is usually something new, and it's interesting to hear the latest by the leading thinkers. I find films like this make me more optimistic and hopeful because they present such a bleak view it can't possibly all be true and it's fun to poke holes in the theories and find the good things that are happening (deductive reasoning is rampant in futurology), but if your easily overwhelmed and depressed by doom and gloom I don't recommend it!",1236470400,,1317,4.604255319148936
