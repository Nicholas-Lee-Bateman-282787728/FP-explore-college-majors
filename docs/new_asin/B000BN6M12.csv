2427889,4,B000BN6M12,"Walther Vale is an economics professor who has become bored with his job and mired in loneliness following the death of his wife. He goes to stay at his Greenwich Village apartment while attending an academic conference. But is shocked to discovered a Syrian guy, Tarek, and his Senegalese girlfriend, Zainab, living there. The two had been conned into moving in by a scammer. Yet, instead of kicking them out onto the street, Walter invites them to stay. Tarek helps lift Walter out of his stagnation by teaching him how to play drums. But, while returning from playing in a drum circle, Tarek is picked up by the subway police on a phony charge and taken to a detention center for illegal immigrants. Tarek's mother, Mouna, comes from Michigan and the latter half of the film involves Walter and Mouna trying to get Tarek released.

The film's greatest success is in its well crafted depiction of illegal Muslim immigrants as real people rather than negative caricatures. Another important theme is how these guests, and the creative act of drumming, help Walter re-discover the ""rhythm of life"". The acting, direction and script are all outstanding. I should mention, however, that this film is rather slow paced, especially in its middle section. Fans of ""serious cinema"" probably won't mind. But I think a film about finding the ""rhythm of life"" could have used a little more energy. Also this would have perhaps helped it to reach a wider audience. This is something I think is important because the film's humanistic consideration of the plight of illegal immigrants is something a large number of people need to see rather than this being just another ""art film"" preaching to the converted.

Still this a very fine movie and I would encourage everyone to see it.",1212192000,2,1770,4.877076411960133
2427890,5,B000BN6M12,"Dr. Walter Vale's (Richard Jenkins) not interested in going to New York City to present a paper at a conference to help a fellow colleague and co-author.  His own life takes precedence. Unfortunately, his dean doesn't see it that way.

When he arrives in New York, he discovers that someone's bathing in his tub.  That would be Zainab (Danai Jekesai Gurira), a young Senegalese woman who is as surprised to see him as he is her.  The person sleeping in one of his beds is Tarek (Haaz Sleiman), a young Syrian man who sublet Vale's neglected apartment from a person that Vale doesn't even know.

Vale cannot turn the pair out into the street, so he allows them to remain. As their acquaintance grows, Vale learns how to play the djembe from Tarek and  also the plight of illegal aliens--particularly Muslim ones, post 9/11 after Tarek is erroneously arrested in the subway over jumping the turnstile.

One of the most heartbreaking scenes in this movie is when Vale takes Zaineb and Tarek's mother Moona (Hiam Abbass) to Staten Island. The women, who are both illegal, see the Statue of Liberty in all her glory. Zaineb relates how Tarek, who is now in detention, used to ride the ferry and jump up and down every time Lady Liberty came in sight pretending it was the first time to be in America.

Vale, who'd failed piano lessons four times, learns there's music in everyone's soul.  If you can't play the piano, move on to another instrument until you find one whose music is in sync with your own rhythm.

My husband and I left ""The Visitor"" wishing there was more, hoping that there was a good outcome for the characters. In the lobby, we met a man who'd attended the Sundance Film Festival where ""The Visitor"" screened for the first time.  He told us this was the only film that year that got a standing ovation.  I understand why.

2427891,5,B000BN6M12,"It's only about twice a decade that I run across a movie that really impresses me.  It's usually an obscure film that I entered with no expectations -- but left blown away by its cinematic achievement.

I just saw such a film tonight.  ""The Visitor""

A small independent production with zero-advertising.  Made by Tom McCarthy whose prior film, ""The Station Agent,"" was an imperfect, character-absorbed drama.

The star of this movie is an actor (Richard Jenkins) whom you'll recognize from his numerous roles as minor-characters, most notably the dead-patriarch in ""Six Feet Under.""  All of the other actors are completely-unknown, but talented.

The appeal of this film is its story.  An aged, listless academic, whose wife died earlier, floats through his uninteresting life until something happens to jar him.  What happens next is unexpected, interesting and poignant.  It would ruin the story if I told it to you, so you'll have to trust me.  Suffice it to say it's a story of rebirth.

Like most of my favorite films, it has comedy, pathos, surprises, authenticity and a philosophical examination of what it means to be human.  In short, everything, even politics.

And the presentation is skillfully-crafted.  McCarthy demonstrates what was good about his prior work without dragging it down with what was bad about that work.

See it.",1209081600,6,1343,5.087155963302752
2427892,5,B000BN6M12,"A genuinely unexpected gem. As he proved with his first film as a director and screenwriter, 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Station-Agent/dp/B0001WTWDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Station Agent</a>, Thomas McCarthy knows how to convey the fine line between solitude and loneliness in his characters' lives with an emotional preciseness that doesn't call attention to itself. It's not surprising that McCarthy is an actor because he's able to capture the very subtle nuances in behavior in actors that make his work feel like Edward Hopper paintings come to life. As a result, you pay attention to a simple gesture, a passing glance, a resigned sigh. This time, his protagonist is Walter Vale, an enervated, middle-aged economics professor at a Connecticut college. Widowed and wholly lacking in professional motivation, he begrudgingly accepts an assignment to go to an academic conference at NYU and present a paper on globalization he really didn't write.

Coming back to a Greenwich Village flat he rarely uses, he is surprised to find a couple living there. Not squatters but unfortunate victims of a rental scam, they turn out to be illegal aliens, a Syrian percussionist named Tarek and his girlfriend Zainab, a Senegalese who makes and sells handcrafted jewelry. As withdrawn from life as Walter is, he slowly finds himself bonding with the couple and lets them stay indefinitely. Zainab is slow to trust Walter, but Tarek and Walter become close over a mutual love of African drums. As his wife was a famous classical pianist, Walter had been futilely attempting to find musical inspiration since her death. However, just as this charming tale of world harmony plays out, it comes back to harsh reality when Tarek is arrested and taken to a detention center in Queens for deportation. What McCarthy does from this point forward is show how sadly restrictive the post-9/11 environment has made immigration laws and how there is no recourse to be found under the constant surveillance of a bureaucratic government protected by the latitude of the Patriot Act.

None of this is hit over our heads with a politically motivated sledgehammer. Far from such polemics, the story singularly focuses on Walter's emergence of purpose in helping Tarek. When Tarek's mother Mouna arrives from Detroit, McCarthy adeptly shows how Walter's closeness to Tarek translates without condition to her. It's a moving transformation of a formerly lonely man finding intimacy in the most unlikely situation. In a once-in-a-lifetime role, character actor Richard Jenkins brings heart and soul to Walter in the most economical manner. Best known as the ghostly father in HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under/dp/B000HEVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under</a>, he has worked steadily in films for three decades, his most memorable turn being the gay FBI agent high on heroin in David O. Russell's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flirting-With-Disaster/dp/B0001XALTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flirting With Disaster</a>. With his constant look of resignation on the verge of revelation, Jenkins gives a wondrously poignant, often dryly funny performance that deepens as the story evolves.

Haaz Sleiman and Danai Gurira are terrifically winning as Tarek and Zainab, and they make their bonding with Walter more than credible. As Mouna, Hiam Abbass is no stranger to persevering maternal roles as she brought her particular brand of strength to Hany-Abu Assad's controversial&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paradise-Now/dp/B000E0OE44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paradise Now</a>&nbsp;and Eran Riklis' family dramedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Syrian-Bride/dp/B000EHQ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Syrian Bride</a>. In response to Walter's fumbling overtures, she affectingly conveys her character's resolute stillness and gradual blossoming. There are brief cameos by comic actor Richard Kind as Walter's unctuous neighbor, Deborah Rush as a wealthy and ignorant customer of Zainab's, and Broadway legend Marian Seldes as Walter's failed piano teacher. At first, I thought the film's title was blandly generic in describing those who are here from other lands, but I realize now that the visitor is really Walter as he discovers his soul. The last shot is memorable and captures the fury of his passion with potent force. Strongly recommended.",1208736000,52,4592,6.160686427457098
2427893,5,B000BN6M12,"I'm following Mike Massie's smart lead (see the review below mine) and using 'The Visitor' soundtrack as the means to write about writer/director Tom McCarthy's excellent upcoming movie.  It premiered here in Dallas at the AFI Dallas 08 film festival.  We saw seven movies at this rapidly-growing event.  'The Visitor' was by far the standout.

McCarthy's previous effort,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Station-Agent/dp/B0001WTWDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Station Agent</a>, was a gem.  'The Visitor' is of the same ilk - small cast, 'little' but powerful story, outstanding script, standout acting.  We saw The Station Agent over two years ago, and I think often about the work turned in by Peter Dinklage, Bobby Cannavale and Patricia Clarkson.

Likewise, here there's a trio of wonderful, understated performances here - character actor Richard Jenkins (loved him in David O. Russell's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flirting-With-Disaster/dp/B00000IQC7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flirting With Disaster</a>), Haaz Sleiman (whose smile lights up the screen) and the beautiful Hiam Abbass, whose presence gives me an opportunity for my umpteenth plug of one of my favorite movies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Syrian-Bride/dp/B000EHQ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Syrian Bride</a>.  If Mr. McCarthy has the good sense and taste to put Hiam Abbass in a movie, I suspect he saw it, too.  Ms. Abbass is unforgettable there.

Hopefully, McCarthy's new film gets the good audience and wide distribution it deserves in 2008.

Oh yeah, since I'm actually supposed to be reviewing the DVD here, let me say that music plays an important part of this film and is a key in Jenkins' character's transformation.  Brilliant stuff.",1207353600,4,1871,6.560975609756097
2427894,4,B000BN6M12,"With a highly inventive introduction to cheerfully mismatched characters, The Visitor is a daring look at the hopelessness of unfortunate immigration circumstances. Superbly acted and beautifully scored, the film doesn't back down from its touching subject matter and realistically tragic events, but instead infuses them with aptly-timed comic relief and the persuasive power of music and romance.

Bitter and bored college professor Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) travels to his New York apartment after being forced to attend a conference on global economization. Immediately he discovers a couple living in his home, and out of kindness and the appeal of company, he invites them to stay. Tarek Khalil (Haaz Sleiman) plays the drums, and soon gets the unsociable Walter to take up the instrument. Tarek's girlfriend Zainab is slower to acknowledge Walter's hospitality, but eventually warms to his presence.

When Tarek is arrested at the subway and taken to a detention center for illegal immigrants, Walter shows estimable concern for his newfound friend. Weighing his teaching job back in Connecticut against helping a man he's known for less than two weeks, Walter hires a lawyer to aid in Tarek's release. When Mrs. Khalil arrives to find out what's happened to her son, Walter finds himself rediscovering romance as well as what is truly important in his life.

Great care is taken to create sympathy for Tarek and Zainab, even though they are chiefly at fault for their uncertain positions. They've done nothing wrong in the eyes of the viewer, and its best that it stays that way - for the law they break is too complex to designate as morally right and wrong. The Visitor unflinchingly demonstrates the bleakness of their situation, and ensures that their story represents the likely majority of factual examples. The mocking sign ""Know Your Rights"" at the detention center foreshadows the unfortunate prejudices and consequences of an unsympathetic law. In the end, Walter's self-realization and inner revelations are the solace that must outshine his visitor's discouraging plights.

Richard Jenkins' acting is phenomenal, even though his role is to remove a wide array of emotions from his weathered face. Offering many scenes of comedy relief and the amusing rediscovery of long-abandoned romance, Jenkins delivers a wholly believable character that is relatable and easily liked. His distaste for his work and his discontent with life gives his eventual recognition of purpose even more of a cinematic edge. And being a mismatched companion and an unlikely friend lends to further depth and appeal. Though Tarek and Zainab are the first visitors and Mrs. Khalil after that - truly Walter is the visitor to their world - one he was previously completely oblivious to.

Part romance, part comedy and many parts drama, The Visitor presents moral conflict with the faceless evils of uncaring laws and heartfelt bonding between a weary, lonely man and a free-spirited musician. While the film slows in a few spots, the constant interjection of humor safely guarantees that audiences won't lose interest. The Visitor is an uncommonly sincere film that manages to mix harsh realism with crowd-pleasing entertainment.

This is a love story too, in more ways than one.  My wife and I both loved it. We wept. All of the actors here are absolutely superb.

2427931,5,B000BN6M12,"The Visitor, My Review
Watching this movie, it isn't entirely clear which is the title character. Three of the four main characters are immigrants, relative newcomers to this country, but I think the visitor must be Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins). Hes an economics professor who teaches in Connecticut and is visiting his apartment in New Yorkvisiting his own life, in a wayor maybe coming back to life after an extended period of mourning and numbing depression. We gradually learn that he is a widower and that his wife was a concert pianist. He goes to New York grudgingly, obliged to present a paper that he didn't really coauthor, though it bears his name.

On entering his apartment, he encounters a vase of fresh flowers, a mystifying a feminine touch. He opens the bathroom door, triggering terrified screams. A young woman is in the tub. Thus begins an adventure that awakens his compassion and brings him back into the human foldback to life, really. Later, he will find a vase of different flowers, arranged by a different woman (Hiam Abbass), who will bring out the first stirrings of affection since his wifes death.

But the central friendship is with a Tarek (Haaz Sleiman), a young Syrian man who teaches him to play the drums. Glimpses of Professor Vale attending the economics conference are interspersed with scenes of the professor, still in suit and tie, playing drums in the park beside young African men.

But to be alive is to feel pain as well as joy. This is not a feel-good, happy-ending kind of movie, but its one that stays with you for days. It was made by Tom McCarthy, the same director who made The Station Agent, and its a product of the post-9/11 world, a time when it was suddenly much harder for immigrants to enter the country and stay. A movie well worth watching again now. Maybe the audience is The Visitor, learning what its like to live in constant fear of deportation.",1491004800,,1911,4.7155688622754495

2428017,5,B000BN6M12,"THE VISITOR is a 90 minute color movie, taking place over the course of about one month some time in the present era.  The opening scenes in the movie take place at a college campus in New England, while most of the movie takes place in New York City.  The New York City scenes take place in the professor's apartment, at a night club that features jazz, in a city park where a row of conga drum players congregate, at an elegant restaurant, at an out-of-doors street fair where arts and crafts are sold, and (unfortunately) at a detention center.

The characters and a few plot elements are as follows:

(1) A professor, perhaps about 60 years old.  The man's wife had been a recording artist and from time to time the soundtrack of the movie features her recording of Beethoven's Waldstein Sonata.  But the wife had died prior to the storyline of this movie, apparently accounting for the man's crankiness towards his students.  As the opening minutes progress, the viewer begins to understand that the professor is a failed academic.  He is only teaching one class.  His field of ""expertise"" is economic development in poorly developed countries.  (I am not sure how any person with a faculty appointment at a small New England college can have expertise in this sort of subject -- thus, it should be apparent to most viewers of this movie that the professor's career was based mainly on reading things, and not on first hand observation or on any real knowledge.).  Near the very end of the movie, the professor grimly states that he has taught the same class for 20 years.  Please recall a scene from ABOUT SCHMIDT, where a stranger at an RV campground befriends Jack Nicholson, and they have a friendly chit-chat over supper in the little dining room in the RV.  Jack Nicholson eventually confides his present situation, and the woman sympathizes and proclaims, ""You sad man, you sad, sad man.""  That is the same situation as the professor in the film, THE VISITOR.  The professor's crankiness is shown at the beginning of the story, when he refuses to accept a student's term paper, because it is late.  Also, his crankiness is evident because he fires his piano teacher (although an amusing part of the piano teacher episode is that the teacher treats him like a five year old, i.e., in the way she instructs him to curl his fingers like a tunnel, and to make sure there is enough room in the tunnel for a choo-choo train to go through).

(2) This is about Tarek the conga drummer and his girlfriend.  Tarik is a devastatingly handsome man in his twenties.  He plays conga drums and performs with a jazz group at a New York City night club.  Tarek is from Syria and his girlfriend is from Senegal.  The girlfriend makes jewelry and sells it at a street fair with other arts'n'crafts people.  In one comedic scene, a white woman buys one of her jewelry pieces for $35, and asks, ""Where are you from?""  The girlfriend replies, ""Senegal.""  The white woman then exclaims, ""I spent some time in Cape Town.""  (At this point, most viewers will find amusement of the extreme stupidity of the white woman.).  In fact, the craftsman at the next table, a young man from Israel, then relates a story about a customer who asked, ""Where are you from.""  The man then says his answer was, ""Israel.""  The Israeli then relates the customer's remark, ""Have you been to the Holy Land?""  (Viewers of this movie will find amusement in the customer's stupid remark about Cape Town, and about the other customer's stupid remark about the Holy Land.)

(3) The professor (played by Richard Jenkins). meets Tarik (played by Haaz Sleiman) and Tarek's girlfriend.  The professor needs to be in New York City to present a paper at an academic meeting.  But to his surprise, Tarek and the girlfriend are living in his New York apartment, and they've been there for a month.  The couple realize that they were not supposed to be living there, and decide to leave.  But the professor invites them to stay, and so they stay.  The professor becones more and more interested in Tarek's conga drumming, and an informal, unspoken relationship begins, where Tarek  gives lessons in exchange for free living quarters.  The drum is actually called a djembe.

(4) Unbridled joy.  The plot develops expeditiously and naturally.  The professor eventually has learned enough about drumming, so that he is proficient enough to join the line of seated conga drummers at the city park in New York City.  The professor smiles broadly as he drums.  In my opinion, this is probably the first time he experienced unbridled happiness in years and years.  Although the viewer might be struck with the following issue or point, it is not at all the case that the movie attempts to teach the following issue -- the notion that an uptight college professor is abandoning his European roots, and adopting African drumming culture.  At any rate, the professor has found true happiness, and a new source of motivation in life (conga drumming).  Okay, the movie has more of a point to make than this.  Because his karma has been ignited, the professor becomes motivated to help Tarek with his problems with the immigration authorities.  SPOILER ALERT.  Do not worry, I will not give away the ending.  But what I will say, is that everybody's problems get worse.

(5) FELA KUTI.  It could be argued that one of the main characters is a three-foot tall inanimate object (the djembe drum), just as R2D2 is one of the main characters of Star Wars.  In this movie, the Syrian man's career is performing on the djembe.  Also, the djembe and the associated milieu of other conga drum players, is the reason why the professor got his groove back.  Moreover, recordings by Afrobeat composer Fela Kuti are featured in the movie's sound track, and one of the scenes in this movie has a closeup of an album cover of one of Fela Kuit's albums.  Hence, it stands to reason that some viewers of this movie who are in need of ""getting their groove back"" will be inspired to become fans of Afrobeat music, including that recorded by Fela Kuti.",1459814400,,6073,4.699810606060606

2428064,5,B000BN6M12,"With the essence of immigration being a highly sensitive discussion especially within the political race, I saw several posts on Facebook that referenced immigration but one that stuck out in my mind is this one (paraphrasing) we are all immigrants let's give the Native Americans back their land.  If you really look at it and when you hear people talk about their history they mainly say my parents was from ........ and they came to this country for a better life.  The Visitor is that type of story.  I truly loved this movie because it showed the human side of living in this country despite the various types of discrimination.

Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) Arabian and Zainab (Danai Gurira) Senegal are both illegal immigrants who are living in the the Bronx under the radar.  One day Tarek and Zainab encounters Walter (Richard Jenkins) who finds them in his house due to an illegal subletting issue that was not their fault and an awesome friendship begins between the three. The bond is so great that Tarek begins to show Walter that despite his life of privilege that if Walter lets loose he too can experience joy and happiness.  Tarek begins to teach Walter the Djembe which changes Walter's life forever.

Written and Directed by Tom McCarthy shows that despite the circumstances we all have a right to a better quality of life.  There are some things that we will encounter that may cause us to be discriminated against more than others but we must live life to its fullest.  For several reasons some immigrants are denied citizenship and/or temporary residence in this country while others have no problem being admitted and probably should not be admitted (i.e. terrorists of 9/11).  If you are looking for a movie that speaks to human rights pick up a copy of The Visitor.

It's the story of paths unexpectedly crossing and of making new friends with people who fall outside of our normal circles (oh that we were all more open to that). Without giving any of the story away, Richard Jenkins plays a professor who lives in Connecticut but keeps an apartment in New York City. One day while returning to the apartment after a long absence, he finds a young immigrant couple living there...and so begins their accidental friendship.

It's a wonderfully story, beautifully told and all of the acting is stellar. Richard Jenkins should have won every award in the book for this movie. He is fast become my favorite actor of all time. But all of the acting is great.

Hopefully the movie will make you view immigrants and, in particular, Muslim immigrants in a new light. It did that for me. I can't promise the movie is without its moments of pain, but such is reality. A brilliant film.",1441065600,,963,4.658823529411765
2428092,4,B000BN6M12,"I watched this film several years ago on loan from the library. Excellent. The story of a discontent college professor, a widower, who is almost forced by circumstances outside his control to befriend an undocumented  immigrant couple. It is a film about friendship and a film about lives restored through compassion, on several fronts, about a man who doesn't like change but realizes he has to grow, to change and become more. For the most part it is a quiet film, nothing extraordinary happens, at least not on the outside. This is not an a-political film but, while there IS a moral lesson, or more than one, the focus is on the people, their relationship to one another and how, if you open up, you can grow and help others to grow. It is about looking beyond your own culture and subculture and really seeing and loving people unlike yourself.

I REALLY liked this film. But, to those who want fast-paced eye candy, don't look here. I am a Christian. This film is not. But, without ever being ""moral"" or trying to preach a word about love, it still teaches the central lesson Christ taught, to love one another as God loved us. However, a word of warning to my fellow Christians and those who are sensitive: there were a few bad words (after this many years, I only truly remember one), and there was an implication that something sexual had occurred behind closed doors twice (nothing shown). Neither the language used nor the sexual implications were gratuitous. They were wholly in line with the characters and the story. Especially in the case of the worst of the language, the female character who was swearing was deeply emotional over a tragic event, again, not gratuitous. The immigrant couple was unmarried.

The acting was very good. I had a hard time believing I had never, ever heard of any of these actors with the exception of the main one, Richard Jenkins, and I had only seen him in extremely small, bit parts.

Finally, the ending was unexpectedly real. Non-Hollywood. I liked the ending. Not everyone will. It leaves lives, as they usually are, open-ended, without resolution, but lives positively changed by having shown compassion to one another.

All in all, recommended highly.",1440892800,,2205,4.776902887139108

2428258,4,B000BN6M12,"While watching the film The Visitor many audience members in the United States and all around the world can experience similarity to the plot of the movie. The Visitor is a film directed by Thomas McCarthy, and it explained the beauty of Art and Exiled by explaining the actor in the movie who was an author by the name of Walter Vale, played by Richard Jenkins, and how he was somewhat forced to go outside of his comfort zone and attend a conference in New York City. The audience can relate to his exiled when they understand the feeling of being forced to do something, however the director highlighted this by having the character being lonesome from the loss of his wife. Even throughout the film he said that he likes to keep himself busy by pretending to do something but he is really not doing anything. However, the truth of the film is shown when Walter meets a couple by accident since he thought no one was living in his old apartment and much to his surprise found a lady in the bathroom and almost fought the ladys husband. Little did Walter know that they were illegal immigrants using the house as an exile method. The reason why the United States have so many illegal immigrants is because everyone is looking for the American Dream just like this couple was. The dream to make money and start new in a new place even though they have to live their whole lives in fear is better than living their whole lives not knowing if there is anything better for them out there.
Surprisingly the director decided to change the film from what is usually done and created a bond between these unlikely characters. Walter, an older man, Tarek and Syria all bond over music, which is the art of the film. Most directors choose to have characters like Walter, an older Caucasian male playing the role of a dictator and would have report them since it would be considering doing his country a service. The director took a different approach and made them bond over Tarek teaching him how to play the drums. In learning how to play the drum Walter realized he had made a new friend, filling the void of losing his wife. Through camera angles, and music the director is able to let the audience figure out the loneliness of Walter by having him follow a certain routine throughout his day, the expression in his face while carrying the routine, the far away shots to get a field of the city liveliness and alone a person can feel being the small fish in big pond. However, the camera angles and movement of the film change once he is introduced to the love of drums and the audience can constantly see the way him and Tarek bond over it; the camera angles are suddenly closer to the character which lets the audience see the reflection of joy from the character, the music is upbeat and happy, the lighting from the film is suddenly brighter and better, and the routine of his day become sporadic and more fulfilling.
Suddenly Tarek is committed of a crime he did not do and because he does not have papers in the United States he is facing deportation. Syria grows concern and wonders what this means for her life, and since immigration is a subject of being exiled she has the choice of living in a country that she fears even more now or follow him. The film is heartwarming and audiences can understand their place in the world by questioning the lives of others and how easy they have it compare to those illegal immigrants. The exile part of the film is how one has to be forced to exile the comfort of ones home in order to experience the world and service ones life better, and the actually exile of the film is to be forced out of ones country even though you do not belong with the country home is where you feel you belong. And in many viewers eyes New York was Tareks home. All in all the film was called The Visitors because when entering illegally one is a visitor until they are caught and no longer seen as a wanted guest and have to be forced to leave.",1395532800,,3969,4.430916552667578

Each scene is like a little piece of a mosaic, building the story tile by tile.  The four leads are perfectly cast, and especially Richrd Jenkins' performance is a tour-de-force.  And I'm not talking Al Pacino-style tour-de-force with yelling and emotiong and chewing the scenery.  This is a completely stripped down performance.  He doesn't just inhabit the role of Walter, he IS Walter.

I'm glad that he was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for this role, though of course he didn't win.  Performances like this don't win, because they're not showy.

There's one moment that stands out for me.  Probably others who see this film might not remember it or single it out, but it's where the mother comes to NYC and he takes her to meet Tarek's girlfriend, who is a street artist selling jewelry.  He agrees to watch her booth while she goes off for tea with Tarek's mother.  He's sitting there on a folding chair, a middle-aged professor, and a woman comes along and looks at Zaineb's jewelry, and he's sort of peering at her wares laid out on the table, trying to wing it, knowing nothing about the business, and finally he says in a hesitant but encouraging tone ""It's all handmade.""",1366416000,,1445,4.6156862745098035

The Visitor
Review
By Richard Edward Noble

Because of the current political animosities, this movie will not get the credit it deserves.

Richard Jenkins gives a wonderful performance of the main character, Walter.

He plays a college professor, a widower. He is clearly a very lost and lonely man, though well off, successful in academia and living a secure existence.

Walter does not know what to do with himself.

He is totally bored with his life and his career.

We are never introduced to his deceased wife but she is felt strongly in Walter's lost and lonely state.
Walter is ordered to go to New York and present a paper. He doesn't want to go. He didn't even write the paper. But he must.

When he arrives at his apartment - a second home from which he has been absent for years - he finds to the peril of his life that it is occupied.

The intruders are there, unaware that they have leased the apartment illegally. Walter manages to explain his position and the intruders agree to leave.

Walter takes pity and relents. They are allowed to stay until they can find a new apartment.

Walter then becomes our guide to the underworld of illegal immigration. Both of his guests are here in the U.S. without legal permission. Via Water's naivet&eacute; we are taken on a tour of this world within a world.

Walter knows nothing of his guests' situation or this third world within our first world nation.

Walter's melancholy dominates yet there is an excitement that builds in the viewer as we are all led through the intrigue that follows.

All the acting is superb.

The story is real, honest and heart rendering.

This is a great movie. I have watched it twice and I'm sure I will watch it again in the future.

I was able to associate with every character in the movie.

I have even been inspired by Walter and his musical aspirations. I am an amateur jazz drummer and since watching Walter and listening to the drum circles in the park, I have been hunting online to buy a Djembe. I love the rhythms and the African drum mixtures.

If you can get past today's phobias and politically inspired hate and belligerencies, I'm sure you will love this movie.
It's a winner.

2428376,4,B000BN6M12,"The Visitor is a feature-length movie by Overture Films.  It was an Official Selection at several critical film festivals including Sundance and South by Southwest and has met loads of critical acclaim.  The Visitor is a moving story that makes the issue of immigration personal.  What if someone you cared about was suddenly gone and could never return?  That is what happens to the characters in the story.

Walter (played by Richard Jenkins) is an economics professor, bored with his life since his wife passed away.  On a rare return trip to his apartment in New York, he finds a young couple, Tarek and Zainab, living there under the assumption that they had legitimately rented the place.  Walter lets them stay while they look for another place and Tarek teaches Walter to play the djembe drum, a practice that gives new energy to Walter's life.  When Tarek gets stuck in a subway turnstile and has to jump over it to get through, even though he has already paid, he is arrested.  It is only then that Walter learns that his new friends are illegal immigrants from Syria and Senegal.  Tarek's mother comes to visit and Walter acts as the women's proxy visiting Tarek in detention and hiring an immigration attorney.

This emotionally-driven drama questions the fairness of immigration laws and brings up tough questions.  Tarek, his mother, and Zainab are good people who work, add to our culture, and never break the law.  However, some may wonder why they all came here illegally to begin with, and the movie does not address the current roadblocks to achieving legal residency.  This is not a Christian movie - the only reference to religion is that Tarek and Zainab are Muslims - but it raises important questions that Christians should be thinking about.  Although many of us do not personally know an illegal immigrant, The Visitor paints an image of what that would be like.  The movie is rated PG-13 but there is no sex or bad language.",1319414400,7,1951,4.7791044776119405

Sent to NYC to deliver a lecture on a paper he supposedly wrote (but didn't), he discovers a couple have taken up residence in his little-used mid-town apartment. Both are in the U.S. illegally. The man is an African drum player from Syria, the woman a Senegalese craftsmaker. Somehow all three become friends.

One afternoon following a music session in the park, the Syrian is wrongly arrested on the subway for turnstile jumping. He's held by INS for deportation and his mom arrives from Detroit to try to prevent this. The professor falls in love with her, but the story does not end happily for anyone.

Now, what would we rather have--legal criminals or illegal honest people? Tough question when it comes to law, but when it comes to true answer, I guess the answer is simple.

2428381,5,B000BN6M12,"The plot of this film though basic is serious and through its simplicity we get a deep character study into the lives of four characters.  We also get left with many questions about our country and its systems.  The film does not wrap itself up in a pretty bow with a happy ending.  The ending is actually open ended with much food for thought for the viewer.

The weight of the movie weighs on the shoulders of Richard Jenkins who portrays Walter, a widowed college professor who lives in the country but also holds an apartment in New York City.  When he visits New York he finds two homeless illigal aliens haven been living in his apartment.  They thought that the apartment had been rented to them and had no idea it was owned by Walter.  All reaction to this situation is very believable and Walter ends up letting the couple stay with him.  He forms a bond with them, especially with Syrian musician Tarek, and seems to find a newfound emotional release through them.  A simple mishap leads to Tarek being arrested by the immigration authorities and he is threatened with deportation.  The story proceeds as his mother comes to New York and stays with Walter.  A special bonds is formed between these two as well.

The acting here is superb from the entire cast and through the simple story the viewers heart will be broken and many issues will be raised.  These are not generic characters.  Richard Jenkins gives a slowly simmering emotional performance of perfection and Haaz Sleiman as Tarek matches him scene for scene.  This is a film that raises issues about our countries laws regarding illegal aliens in the country and especially the strict changes made after 9/11.  This is a deep, emotional drama realistically told.  There are no overboard plot twists.  Instead we have what could be a real life situation told through the emotions and actions of the characters.  This film touched me deeply and I had to own it for repeated viewing.  Deep character studies well done are hard to come by.  This one is superb.  I also purchased the blu ray which adds much to the story with its vivid and realistic visual presentation.  Though mostly a dialogue driven movie the sound provided is superb.

Jenkins, actually the whole cast are superb, and very well served by a script that makes them sound like real people living in the real world. Jenkins is so tightly wound throughout that when he breaks down over dinner with Abbass that it's as cathartic for us as it is for him. When he erupts in the detention center, so honestly bewildered, so inarticulately outraged, you want to stand up and applaud--by then you're a step behind the worm when he turns. Writer-director McCarthy is also wise enough to let the 1984-ish detention center and its Catch-22 employees speak for themselves.

A class act in making your point without beating someone over the head with a baseball bat. A true test of the quality of this film is that I am convinced the characters' lives are continuing on after the film leaves them, and I am intensely curious as to what is happening to them.",1290643200,,961,4.522988505747127
2428390,5,B000BN6M12,"This is a wonderful look into the lives of several illegal immigrants.  They are trying to make it in the US, just like virtually all of our ancestors did.  In this film, their situation, with its insecurity and hope, is deeply compelling.  That they are also Muslims facing prejudice and fear is an additional layer of interest.  To its credit, the film shows the charming side of Islamic culture better than any recent film treatment that I have seen - I know this charm from direct experience via work and travel.

The plot of the film is also fun and clever.  A prof, grieving the loss of his wife and burnt out in his job, discovers a couple living in his apartment.  They had been scammed, as immigrants often are.  Out of sympathy, he offers to let them stay while they wort their situation out, in the process getting to know them.  The young man, who has a striking charisma to him, befriends the prof and brings him into his music world, re-igniting a smoldering passion  for music that this outwardly square man has hidden.  They begin playing bongos in the subway together and you believe it!

When events take a tragic turn, the young man's mother shows up.  Though middle-aged and care worn, she too has a grace and quiet charisma to her, a beauty that radiates from within.  The prof learns more about the family and in a way falls for the mother, which is portrayed with a subtlety of emotion that is extremely rare in American films, though of course this is an indy film.

At this time when immigration is a political issue dominated by demagogues, this lovely film could help us to regain our empathy.  At the moment, when the debate stops at the word ""illegality"", we stand to lose so many creative, energetic, and ambitious people.  I see it as tragedy, a closing off of the American mind that will make the country into the ""old world"" that we like to scorn.

2428392,5,B000BN6M12,"Knowing nothing about this smaller independent movie, I rented it on a whim from Netflix based on several good reviews and was deeply moved by the acting performances and the storyline.

Middle aged Connecticut College professor Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) has been widowed for several years and doesn't find much joy in life.  He lives each day passionless and disaffected, unaroused by anyone or anything around him, although there are signs that he is trying to find a way to get connected to life.  As the movie opens, he has been learning to play the piano for many months, although not very successfully and he is dismissing yet another in a long string of piano teachers because he cannot find in himself the passion he either knows exists or should exist in learning to play a musical instrument.

Going through his professorial duties on autopilot (he has been teaching the same Economics class for 20 years and cares little about it) Walter is ordered by the dean of the department to travel to New York City to present a paper at a conference that a colleague has written.  Completely unmotivated and viewing the trip as nothing less than a chore, Walter treks into Manhattan to an apartment that he has not used in ""a long  time"" only to encounter two twenty-something illegal aliens living there in Syrian man Tariq (Haaz Sleiman) and his Senegalese girlfriend Zainab (Danai Gurira).  Learning they were conned out of all their money to acquire the apartment several months ago, Walter takes pity on them and lets them stay for a day or two until they find another place to live.

However, a friendship soon blossoms between Walter and the outgoing and likeable Tariq who is a gifted musician on a special type of African drum.  Walter begins to find life within himself through the resonant beat of the drum and Tariq's infectious enthusiasm for music and life.  Unfortunately, things suddenly take a turn for the worse when Tariq, a Muslim, is arrested in one of New York's subway stations for allegedly not paying the toll and he is soon incarcerated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and threatened with deportation.  Rationally assuming justice will quickly prevail, Walter soon finds himself deeply moved by Tariq and Zainab's plight and begins to assert himself emotionally in helping them.

Note:  Many may not care for the movie's plot which involves illegal immigration in America, especially considering the divisive political times in which we live in regarding this issue as our country struggles over how to integrate the 10's of millions of illegal immigrants now living in the country.  However, the subject of immigration in The Visitor, really serves more as a vehicle for the true theme of the movie....friendship and the discovery of conviction and meaning in one's life.",1281744000,,2811,4.953191489361702

2428406,2,B000BN6M12,"""The Visitor"" is a story of a lonely, aimless widowed economics professor, Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins).  He has a shallow meaningless life now that his wife has died and tries to learn piano at retirement age.  His job as professor has not changed for years, teaching the same class over and over and he is stuck in a rut.

Vale has to leave his Connecticut home to speak at a conference in Manhattan, that his college insists he participate.  Vale arrives at his Manhattan apartment which he has not visited since his wife died.  He is is surprised when he finds a young immigrant couple, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and Zainab (Danai Guira) living quite comfortably and they are upset he came in.  They claim a friend rented the apartment to them.

At this point I was surprised at no anger either way as the young couple packs their belongings and leaves to find somewhere to stay.  For some reason Vale takes pity and invites them back to stay ""a couple of days.""  Tarek teaches Vale how to play an African drum and Vale drops his Classical music and goes for the drums.

Vale learns that Tarek is from Syria and Zainab is from Senegal.  Tarek has talent with the drums and Zainab sells homemade jewelry near the park Tarek plays his drums.  Tarek wants to thank Vale for letting them stay and teaches him the drums and a friendship develops.  They are linked by the vibrant, lively music and playing together.

Since this film was made in 2007, post 9-11 we are reminded constantly of security, American Flags and their fear of being caught.  Tarek and Zainab are both illegal aliens, but the movie goes to great lengths explaining it is not their fault, all they want is a better life.  Tarek's mother Mouna (Hiam Abbass) arrives and explains she is at fault for Tarek not having his papers - after he is put into detention.

The movie gives the ideal plot of cultural barriers being broken through music - and finding the beat of a different drummer gives Walter a new world and a new life.  However, the liberal bias of the movie shows throughout.",1276041600,3,2050,4.554644808743169

I understand it is quite possible for one to take an irrational interest in other people's lives but if I know anything about human relationships this doesn't happen unless both parties are at least cordial with each other. In this case, the black lady (I must say, a drop dead gorgeous black lady because uhm it is a weak movie that just needs an audience on any ground possible) was unnecessarily rude to the professor till the middle of the movie. The (again very good looking) Syrian guy is nice enough but his mum needs a punch on her face for expecting a complete stranger to a) take her to Queens b) take her to a Broadway show c) just treat her like a princess

The characterization was weak. They seemed to be angry for no reason all the time. And worried for no reason. Sure, deportation is cause for worry but their anger and fear were just misplaced. And such Hallmark-type of drama. A university professor misses his flight to take an Arab lady to a detention centre just because she wants to see the area that her son is in (Mind you, her son is not dying.. worst case he us just going to go back to his country). The oh-so pleasant and easy bonding between the black girlfriend and Arab lady just minutes after the Arab lady is surprised to see that her son's girlfriend is ""so black"". The unnecessary tears. The ridiculous sentimental BS. Argh! I almost hit my head against the wall.

There are far worse horrors in this world than living illegally in America. I understand immigration is a big issue but the movie doesn't highlight the real problems faced by immigrants at all. I had no sympathy for those shown in the movie, so if that was the intention of the director, sorry pal.. did not work.",1268524800,12,1838,4.546827794561934

As he meets two younger people from outside the US, he grows to care about them and begins to come out of his shell.  Very real, very sweet, very interesting in a quiet, understated way.

Then in the middle of the film there's an abrupt shift.  It becomes very run-of-the-mill and the characters begin turning to cardboard.  All US government officials are portrayed as evil and uncaring, while all immigrants are seen as gentle and good.  The USA becomes the Great Satan once again.

Then there's another shift and it becomes a sweet, middle-aged love story.  Not bad, but not the film I signed up to see.  It ends with ""the bad guys"" and loneliness winning--so don't see it if you're prone to depression.

Oh, and the cover picture on the DVD gives away the end.  By the time you're in the middle of the film you'll be able to guess the ending because of it.  An irritating, but not uncommon, practice.

2428413,4,B000BN6M12,"The Visitor follows the journey of recent widower and college professor, Walter Vale as he lives his empty and hollow life. He visits his New York City apartment to find that two illegal immigrants have taken refuge there. From that point on the film follows their ever growing friendship as Walter slowly learns to open himself back up to the world and let the wonders of life carry him. The film itself is incredibly well layed out and the characters all fully developed. McCarthy is an actor turned director and that is usually cause for concern, but when I saw his first film, The Station Agent I knew that he was a fully capable storyteller.

Jenkins is an amazing character actor and portrays Walter as a very reserved and closed off person who has basically shut himself off from the world after losing his wife. Tarek who is one of the immigrants is a very skilled drum player, and through music is how Walter learns to become expressive again. He learns to play the drum through Tarek and music becomes his vessel of emotion. If you've seen McCarthy's previous film you will see the recurring theme of isolation and acceptance. That comes to play when his friend Tarek is asked for an ID and doesn't have one and is  thus sent to the department of immigration.

The film plays out and the conclusion is emotionally stirring. If I had to say one thing negative about the story is that the ending is left a bit open ended and to me does not fully conclude Walter's story, but that's just nitpicking. It holds well on its own without getting too preachy about the subject of illegal immigration, which is good. Movies that end up trying to sell a cause versus a story usually don't have a satisfying effect on me, but this one did. Highly recommended especially if you've seen The Station Agent.",1255910400,,1801,4.586956521739131
2428414,5,B000BN6M12,"Writer/Director Thomas McCarthy's ""The Visitor"" is so perfect a viewing experience, and works at so many levels, that I simply can't do it justice! A story of the healing power of music, of the renewal of the spirit, of the loyalty of family and friends, set against a backdrop of an indifferent immigration process...this is truly an exceptional film in every way, and should be at the top of your 'must have' list of films.

The cast is very, very good, with Richard Jenkins' Oscar-nominated performance a standout. He plays Prof. Walter Vale, an Economics professor whose existence has been on autopilot since the death of his pianist wife. With little interest in anything, he drifts, living a life of ""quiet desperation""...until, on an unwanted trip to Manhattan, he discovers Syrian Tarek Khalil and Senegalese Zainab (newcomers Haaz Sleiman and Danai Gurira) in residence at his apartment. While he accepts their apology and promise to leave, he sympathizes with their situation enough to give them a couple of days to move...and when he hears Tarek play an African drum, a bonding based on the unique sound reawakens the dormant spirit of Vale, and a friendship develops that gives his life new meaning....

But when Tarek is arrested, and it is revealed that he and Zainab are illegal aliens, Vale's rediscovered humanity will be tested against a system that simply doesn't care...and when he meets Tarek's mother, Mouna (Hiam Abbass, who is simply terrific), he faces a moral dilemma; does he stay on in Manhattan to do what he can to help, or do the 'proper' thing, and return to his mundane existance in Connecticut?

The film doesn't gloss over the issues, but deals with them on a personal level, in a completely believable fashion, and the frequent musical moments have a pulsating yet sublime quality that truly demonstrates the transcendental power of music. ""The Visitor"", despite it's moments of tragedy, is a celebration of what is best about life...friendship, and the discovery of new avenues to cleanse and renew our souls.

Simply superb!",1254182400,,2062,5.002915451895044
2428415,4,B000BN6M12,"First let me say I like Richard Jenkins and my review of ""The Visitor"" (2007) which brought him an Oscar nomination may be biased. But I am sure that without this veteran actor the film would be yet another well-intentioned but mediocre independent film. As it is, ""The Visitor"" is an intriguing drama and Richard Jenkins is very good as tired college professor Walter Vale who, in his own words, just ""pretends.""

A widowed college professor Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) currently living in Connecticut travels to New York City to attend an academic conference, which, it is obvious, he is not interested. To his great surprise, Walter finds two persons are living in his old apartment, unbeknown to Walter. They are a young Syrian musician Tarek Khalil (Haaz Sleiman) and his girlfriend from Senegal Zainab (Danai Jekesai Gurira) and apparently Tarek and Zainab are led to believe they are really renting the rooms.

Tarek and Zainab leave the professor's room, but they have nowhere to go. Being a good man at heart, Walter lets Tarek and Zainab stay. An unlikely friendship is born when Walter starts to learn djembe, an African hand drum Tarek loves to play.

Thomas McCarthy's second film deals with such important issues as immigration (post 9/11 particularly) and consequently it is partly political. Though the director tries not to show it overtly, it becomes evident where his heart truly lies.

But ""The Visitor"" succeeds most as a character-driven drama and most interesting character appears later in the film: Tarek's mother Mouna who is thoughtful and determined, played brilliantly by Hiam Abbass (""The Syrian Bride""). With convincingly dramatic interaction between Walter and Mouna, which is greatly benefited by the superb performances from two gifted leads, ""The Visitor"" becomes something very emotional in the end.",1253577600,,1837,5.175084175084175

2428420,5,B000BN6M12,"Discovering a little gem like 'The Visitor' is what what the enjoyment of the art of storytelling in film is all about. A simple story of cross culture, immigration, and loneliness, the screenplay carries us into the vastly understated lives of of the four main characters; Walter Vale, the lonely introverted widower who has lost meaning in his life; Tarek, the lively and life positive illegal from Syria; Zainab, Tarek's all too human Sengalese girlfriend, and Mouna, Tarek's mother, whose painful past life and future hopes are always visible in her eyes.
What makes this film unique is that the film shows the viewer story elements by exclusion, by what is NOT said, by the moments of silence between characters, by the incidents of realistically portrayed uncomfortable conversations between the characters. The viewer feels as if he is eavesdropping  on real people who live in a multicultural environment. This method of storytelling is more European than American and  will make the film overly long for some despite its short length. But it strikes the right chord anyway and makes the final 2 scenes with Walter all the more powerful as a result.

2428423,4,B000BN6M12,"One of the major issues leftover from W.'s administration was immigration. `The Visitor' addresses the thorny subject by presenting a story of four people affected by it. As with most issues on this country's agenda, it's not quite so cut and dried as people make it out to be. One might assume you are either for or against. `The Visitor' tears that apart and forces the viewer to re-examine the complexities involved. And I'm not sure that by the last act we can be certain who the `Visitor' truly is.

Aside from some sober realities, `The Visitor' is full of magic on many levels. Richard Jenkins plays `Walter', an academic who appears to be not merely burned out, but a scorched shell of an individual that has been sleepwalking through life. His world changes as many do when a chance occurrence presents him with a decision requiring a spark of humanity.

On the opposite end of the spectrum (and a welcome balance) are Zainab (Dania Gurira)and Tarek (Haaz Sleiman). They are a young couple who live life to it's absolute fullest , while traveling on a near empty tank of gas. They embody every bit of spirit, hope and determination of those who came before them in the massive wave of immigration from the early days of the last century.

An excellent performance from Hiam Abbass (Mouna) lifts the film to new heights. Her addition to the cast was that good. The savvy film goer might be tempted to believe they have gotten the best of the plot guessing game with her arrival. Perhaps. But by this time in the story, anxiety begins to creep in and soon the viewer will be gripped by the decisions leading to the finale.

My paternal Grandparents were among those afforded the opportunity for a new life in America. I couldn't help but think of them while watching `The Visitor's' story unfold. In the high stakes world of public opinion with political futures at stake, something gets lost. It is drowned out amidst the analysts' incessant babble. It is an individual's chance to build upon their dreams in a country that depends upon them to survive that is disappearing.",1245801600,,2082,4.695890410958904

Now matter how well crafted a film is, however, it doesn't necessarily mean I have to agree with it's viewpoint.  The film's positive attributes are it is riveting and Richard Jenkins, an underrated actor who deservedly scored an Oscar nom, gives a career turn.  Though not offensive or disagreeable the film's position on illegal immigration is unaccepatable.  There is a reason we protect our borders even from charming Syrian drummers.  Immigration isn't necessarily a bad thing but there are legal channels to go through.  The film's illegals are not victims of a cold bureaucrasy but deliberate lawbreakers.  The one thing about the film I did find offensive is it's portrayal of Homeland Security officials doing their job as callous dolts.  I admire films that assume the intelligence of their audience and aren't afraid of engaging them in intelligent debate.  That said you don't have to buy into it.",1244937600,11,1021,5.029761904761905
2428435,5,B000BN6M12,"Walter Vale, (Richard Jenkins) is a university professor and writer who we meet with a bit of a dull lifeless way about him.  He is involved with a conference on internationalization and globalization, that he would rather not have had to attend.  When he arrives at his second residence, he discovers he has guests, not his though, living there.

Vale is a very sensitive guy, has a lot of hang ups, but we learn as we get to know the character, he has lost a lot in his life and has had tried to stay somewhat connected with it.  His visitors, Tarek (Slieman) and his girlfriend Zainab, played by Danai Gurira.  As Vale gets them to leave, he realizes that they are harmless toward him and tells them to stay until they find a place.  As the days of the conference pass, Vale sees Tarek playing the African drum, the Djembe.  Symbolic of its ability to be shared and to bring people together (we learn this in the extras), we have the drum and Vale's desire to learn to play a central theme.

Vale has failed at his attempts to learn to play piano.  His relationship with Tarek and the Djembe are a turn around for Vale.  This is all so short lived as Tarek is eventually taken into custody with immigration due to his status.  We get the sense though is that Tarek is here for the right reasons, and we get a view that some who flee here from countries we tend to fear today, come for the same reasons that all who came here did.  We see and hear about Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty and the joy that Tarek and Zainab have for being here.

This is definately a movie that is making a statement, and would it be nice to focus on why freedom loving peoples of all sorts come here to seek a better life.  Gurira is very believable as a Sengalese woman.  It is surprising to see here speak in the extras section, you can view her in the links on the main Visitor page here on Amazon, but I would wait to see that in the extras, she is amazing.  Slieman draws you in to his role.  You are not quite sure when you meet him if he is a good guy or not.  Jenkins, as Vale, sets the tone for his character and for the film.

This is inspiring to me.  It gives us a view that there just may be people here with other motives.  Can we find them, and help them to speak for the many who share their hopes and desires.  Can we somehow find a way to support giving them a chance while finding and screening out those whose desires are less than what anyone would want?

The Visitor may make us think of a few more questions we need to ask ourselves.  Although we desire to protect our country and our future, can that be done with a view that many people who are just that, people, are involved in trying to find a better life.  The Visitor is a must for people who feel that there are possibilities.  It is a great story with a message.",1243987200,,2833,4.171270718232044
2428436,5,B000BN6M12,"In ""The Visitor,"" written and directed by Tom McCarthy, Richard Jenkins brilliantly portrays Professor Walter Vale, an economics teacher who, for years, has been going through the motions of living.  He is intensely isolated, bored with his job, and has forgotten how to interact with others.  When he visits New York to deliver a paper, he is shocked to find a Syrian man, Tarek, and a woman from Senegal, Zainab, living in the place he owns.  It seems that the couple was conned into renting Vale's East Village apartment in his absence.  Instead of calling the police, however, Walter has compassion for the pair and allows them to stay.  As time passes, his life becomes intertwined with theirs.

McCarthy's intelligent and sensitive script is enhanced by Jan Kaczmarek's evocative score, Oliver Bokelberg's atmospheric cinematography, and Tom McArdle's seamless editing.  The entire cast turns in amazing performances.  Each actor delivers his lines with pitch-perfect timing and intonation, using facial expressions and body language to express what words cannot.  It is not surprising that Richard Jenkins was nominated for an Academy Award for his touching depiction of a man living in a bubble of his own making.  Haaz Sleiman, in contrast, is anything but introverted.  He is bursting with self-confidence and cheerful insouciance.  The young man is a musician who plays the drums with such joy that Walter finds himself taking lessons from him and having fun for the first time in years.  Danai Gurira is Tarek's girlfriend, Zainab, a proper and dignified woman who loves Tarek, but is justifiably worried about their future.  When Tarek gets into serious trouble, his mother, Mouna, brought to life by the luminous Hiam Abbass, rushes from Michigan to lend support her son. Walter is instantly smitten with this sweet and lovely lady, and decides to do whatever he can to help this family stay together.

The director and his crew shot both in Los Angeles and New York.  The scenes in the subway and on the streets of Manhattan and Queens capture the city's bustle, rhythm, and multi-ethnic charm.  ""The Visitor"" explores universal themes with exquisite subtlety and not a hint of sentimentality or melodrama.  This film makes us question whether America is still a welcoming place for the ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free.""  To McCarthy's credit, he allows his story to unfold naturally  instead of resorting to clichs and pat conclusions.  Those who are privileged to see ""The Visitor"" will be deeply affected by its quiet power and beauty.",1243209600,3,2562,5.110576923076923
2428437,4,B000BN6M12,"This is a delightful story about a bored, middle-aged college professor whose life is changed when he discovers an illegal immigrant couple living in his Manhattan apartment.

Don't skip over this movie just because some professional reviewers brand the story as ""standard immigrant fare."" I guess I don't watch enough movies to know what standard immigrant fare is. I just thought it was a good story about how a person's life can be drastically changed by one unexpected encounter.

Yes, some of the story is unbelievable. A buttoned-up middle-class white guy doesn't usually have a free-form Syrian drummer-self just itching to break out. A more incremental and less dramatic change would have been more believable. But that doesn't make for a good movie. I also thought the turnstile-hopping scene on which the plot hinges confusing. It is an offense, after all, so it's hard to ignore that thought and remain completely in sympathy with the immigrant couple while the consequences unfold.

But I always appreciate a film that doesn't force a story into a happy ending complete with fireworks and applauding crowd. This one man's awakening to cultures previously hidden from him is reward enough for the viewer.",1242864000,,1215,5.126262626262626

I am not sure if the movie's portrayal of the treatment of immigrants is true or not? If true. Then it's sad that we treat people this way and I hope the movie helps to change the situation. If this is a false recreation then the movie is just a political manipulation, and the movie is just that.

The part which I found interesting was the reflection on us Americans' that in the end we do not care what happens to people in other countries. Tarek's father died, because he wrote against the political establishment of Syria, he died after his brutal treatment in a Syrian prison. You would think that his mother and son could receive political asylum in our country for him speaking out against a tyrannical government? This was glanced over in the movie, and you would think that a professor of third world economics would start to carefully analyze what occurred and help Tarek and his mother, Mouna gain political asylum.

He let Mouna go to Syria without any knowledge what would happen to her once she got there. He just went to the subway and played his drum. This was his liberation? His rebellion? This is a bunch of crap. I am startled how this movie portrayed Americans. I do not think we are represented by this person as a people.

2428439,5,B000BN6M12,"After finally finding time to rent and watch this, I am immediately on the hunt for more films with Richard Jenkins.  The film overall is amazingly dead-on:  a spare, almost poetic script; impeccable casting; creative directing, and brilliant acting from all the major characters.  Jenkins is incredible.  I can't believe I don't already know his work.  I could watch this film over and over, simply for his acting.  A master.

Also, the film is true-to-life.  I've worked with people in immigration detention, and nothing in the film is exaggerated or untrue.",1242432000,3,560,5.076923076923077
2428440,5,B000BN6M12,"Thomas McCarthy's film ""The Visitor"" is a low-key but nonetheless thrilling movie. Several of the key characters are illegal immigrants and the reason I bring this up is that the Mrs. and at least one reviewer couldn't get around the topic of illegal immigration, although I liked the movie very much and James Berardinelli wrote ""In The Visitor, there are no human villains. No one wears a black hat. The antagonist is The System - the nameless, faceless arm of a bureaucracy that flexes its muscles and crushes whoever happens to be in its grip at the time.""

My feeling about immigrants is that except for Native Americans, we are ALL either immigrants or descended from immigrants in the U.S. (And I also try to keep in mind that some American ancestors ""immigrated"" here by force, against their wishes, to be slaves.) If they obey the laws, pay their taxes, etc, I have no problem with those who want to enjoy the privileges I earned simply by being born.

Anyway - I wanted a disclaimer to say that if illegal immigrants could not possibly be sympathetic characters to you, you may not appreciate the delicate beauty in ""The Visitor"".  I think Thomas McCarthy would deserve kudos for writing OR directing - he gets a double pat on the back for both.

You may not recognize the name Richard Jenkins, even though his performance here was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.  He plays Economics Professor Walter Vale.  After years playing the cop, the administrator, the dead father in ""Six Feet Under"" he gets his first starring role, and not many can claim an Oscar nomination in their first starring role. In his early sixties, Professor Vale is a lonely, lonely man.  His wife, a classical pianist who was well-known, has passed on.  No children are ever mentioned.  Walter is going through the motions of teaching and life up in Connecticut.  He earned enough laurels early in his career that a younger colleague asks to add his name to a paper - to make it more prestigious and able to be published.  When she goes on maternity bedrest the dept head orders Walter to go to a meeting to present ""their"" paper.  Walter admits to his boss that he hasn't even read the paper that bears his name.

Walter drives into the city and lets himself into his apartment.  He surprises an African woman in his bathtub and her boyfriend rushes over to push Walter against a wall, thinking him an intruder. The situation is quickly sorted out - the Syrian man Tarek Khalil (played with infectious optimism by Haaz Sleiman) and the woman from Senegal, Zainab (played with believable caution by Danai Gurira) ""rented"" the apartment from some opportunist who noted it unoccupied.  Tarek and Zainab gather their modest belongings and leave.  Walter finds a framed photo left behind and sees them outside at a pay phone, practically begging for a place for the night.  Walter invites them back to the apartment to stay the night.

A cautious friendship develops between Walter and the young couple.  Tarek, friendly and engaging, is an accomplished African drummer.  Zainab, cautious perhaps both because of their status as illegals and because of being duped into ""renting"" Walter's apartment, is quiet and respectful around their benefactor.

The relationship begins to thaw Walter's soul.  He obviously loved his wife's playing, and has been taking piano lessons so that her piano doesn't sit dormant, but he is stuck at some rudimentary beginning level and his heart is not into it.  You can feel his frustration at not playing very well, but even more, missing the music of his wife, both literally and figuratively.  (When it is plain Walter is ""phoning it in"" back at the University, you get the idea that he is given some leeway both because of his past accomplishments, but also because of the loss of his wife.)  Tarek invites Walter to the club where he plays drums and sings with a Jazz combo.

Walter is a rank beginner on the piano, and has never touched a drum, but something about the inviting Tarek draws Walter to try a few whacks on the skin.  Tarek discovers Walter taking a few tentative blows on his drum, then provides an impromptu lesson.  Later, he invites him to a drumming jam in Central Park.  Walter is hesitant, then takes a seat beside the other African drummers, adding his flavor to the musical mixture.

Returning on the subway, something looks irregular as Tarek and Walter pass the drums over the turnstiles and the cops move in and arrest Tarek. They pay no heed to Walter - the well-dressed white man is not ""suspicious"", but neither is his word enough for them to let Tarek go.

Tarek is taken to a detention facility.  He goes home to tell Zainab, who knows her relationship with Tarek is doomed in the United States.  She moves out rather than stay with the Professor who is little more than a stranger to her.  Tarek's mother, Mouna (played with elegant honor by Hiam Abass), drives down from Michigan when Tarek doesn't answer her phone calls.

A tentative relationship begins between Walter and Mouna - only friendly - the actions of a concerned family member.  Zainab and Mouna can't quite understand why this stranger is so helpful to them.  Initially they don't understand that they are the only ""family"" he has.

Will Tarek be deported?  Does romance blossom between Walter and Mouna?  This film answers these questions believably. Honestly.  It is a good film.",1242086400,,5409,4.7669172932330826

2428442,4,B000BN6M12,"Tom McCarthy, The Visitor's director, isn't shy about sharing his feelings regarding the United States' current immigration policy.  McCarthy obviously believes that a more open immigration policy would be beneficial to the country's overall well-being.  This point can be seen when Walter Vale, played by Richard Jenkins, agrees to let two illegal immigrant squatters, played by Haaz Sleiman and Danai Gurira, to remain in his apartment.  As a result of this generous act, Vale finds his previously closed perspectives opening up, and a new energy brought into his life.  As if this allegory weren't enough to convey the director's point, he hammers the message home by having one of the squatters arrested in violation of current immigration law.  The legal and personal struggles that result after that arrest vividly convey the director's opinion that the current policy is not only bad; it is also depriving American society of new energy and ideas.  To say that these points are delivered in a ham-fisted manner would be an understatement.

Still, even ""message movies"" where the message is pounded into the audience with the subtlety of a sledgehammer can be entertaining.  And fortunately The Visitor is entertaining, thanks to extraordinary acting from everyone in the film.  Hiam Abbass, playing the mother of one of the squatters, touchingly portrays the exhaustion of someone who's lived on society's edges for a while.  Sleiman and Gurira are very good in showing the energy and resourcefulness inherent in many new immigrants.  However, the best performance is put forth by Jenkins, who was deservingly nominated for an Oscar in this role.  Not only does Jenkins believingly depict Vale's vague discontentment at his closed life before he met the squatters, he also convincingly takes the audience through Vale's metamorphosis into a new personal perspective.  Jenkins' performance gives the otherwise blatant message credibility.

Whether you agree with McCarthy's views on immigration or not, it's hard to argue with the film's effectiveness in delivering those views.  The credit for this effectiveness rests with the actors, who give authority to the message with their performances.  The Visitor does skirt dangerously close to being propaganda, but ends up being intriguing and entertaining.",1241222400,,2311,5.395543175487465

Richard Jenkins gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a college professor with a mundane existence whose life turns upon meeting a pair of immigrants staying in the New York apartment he uses when he has busines in the city (he lives in an upscale suburban neighborhood otherwise). Once the initial shock wears, the three begin to warm to each other and the prof begins to get in touch with a passion for life which had been extinguished since his marriage ended a while back.

This is clearly a fine independent movie which speaks to how immigrants are looked upon as well as what can happen when one begins to remember how wonderful life can really be and begins to come alive once again.  This movie is full of surprising twists and turns which make for an interesting movie experience.

He is a visitor in his own home.  He lets them stay and they start to form a bond and he finds joy in learning the drums and the friendship with Tarek.

When Tarek is arrested, he finds out that the couple is illegal. He helps get an immigration lawyer for Tarek and then Tarek's mother shows up. Jenkins abruptly takes a sabbatical from the University in Connecticut where he teaches to help and to spend more time in NY with these people who have become more than visitors in his life.  When he takes a ferry ride with Tarek's fiance and mother, Jenkins even admits he has never been up in the Statue of Liberty.  He also admits he hasn't been to see Phantom of the Opera to Tarek's mother.

These visitors to his apartment and to this country have made him more fully involved in life.  He is no longer just a visitor--he is fully involved.

It is a quiet, slow but thoughtful movie that touches on the issue of illegal immigrants who have made good lives for themselves in this country.  It is a microcosm of the ""melting pot"" that this country has always been.  It is about how, no matter our nationality, our religion, our station in life, we have much we can give and learn from each other.

One of them gets picked up and is deported, all the while saying (and probably thinking) that he had done nothing wrong.  What part of being in our country ILLEGALLY confused him and the others who believe he didn't do anything wrong?  The bottom line is that justice was done for one of the three illegal aliens.  It's too bad the authorities didn't deport the other two.  Oh, and by the way, the acting was horrible.  I would have given this movie a zero if I could.",1238889600,9,549,4.333333333333333
2428449,1,B000BN6M12,"I would like to believe that the creators and promoters of this film innocently intended only to tell a tender story of human striving for happiness in a cold cruel world.  But the underlying political message is too overt to ignore.  Three illegal immigrants, a mother and son from Syria and a woman from Senegal, come to America and remain many years after their visas expire.  They are personable, likeable characters.  You would not mind having them as neighbors or friends.  The stodgy, not-nearly-so-likeable professor from Connecticut who returns to his infrequently-visited apartment in New York City to find the Syrian man and the Senegalese woman living in his apartment quickly comes to like them too.  Near the end of the film, the professor proclaims in angry protest to immigration officials, ""These are good people!""

Yes, they are good people.  And the makers of the film apparently would have us feel that America, or at least the American government, is bad to detain and deport these good people.  This shallow message is far too simplistic and makes for a shallow film.  There is no recognition of the fact that, along with the good, there are plenty of bad people making up the illegal immigrant population.  I would have found the film far more appealing had there been a message of advocacy for better screening and efficient processing of the good from the bad so as to more openly invite the good and exclude the bad from immigration and permanent residency.

Apart from the political dishonesty of its emotional manipulation, it's a slow plodding story.  The acting is mediocre.  There is never a moment of comic relief.  And I think it would be really hard for most Americans to relate to the character of the professor who somehow manages to enjoy a very comfortable life in spite of the appearance that he works very little and, until he gets caught up in the immigration situation of his house guests, seems to care little for anyone else.  I can not recommend this film.",1238284800,15,2001,4.8240469208211145

2428451,2,B000BN6M12,"Warning: This review may contains spoilers--If you think back at your time in college, how many professors were like Walter Vale, The Visitor's main character? How many were so depressed that they felt that they were only going through the motions in life? Most of the professors I knew had pretty big egos--they enjoyed imparting information to their students and promulgating a philosophy of life they believed in. Why is this particular professor so cut off from his emotions? Was it the death of his wife? His humdrum routine at the college? Writer/director Thomas McCarthy has created a character so extreme in his detachment that he doesn't seem real. Vale's detachment is not due to anger but rather he is a symbol of what McCarthy perceives as a malaise in Western Culture.

Vale (the symbol) lacks one ingredient that can make him a self-actualized person. And that is spontaneity. Certainly his superiors up at the college and colleagues at the NYU development conference he attends don't have the spontaneity that will turn them into more alive (and better) people. The only people who can redeem the robotic Vale are the spontaneous, 'life-affirming' illegal immigrants who come into Vale's life and act as the catalyst for his self-redemption.

The ego-less and sad-sack Vale fails to call the police immediately when he finds Tarek and Zainab, the Syrian-Palestianian and Sengalese illegal immigrants, illegally squatting in his apartment. Out of the goodness of his heart, Tarek (with Zainab's loving support) will teach Dr. Vale how to become a 'cool' guy. He accomplishes this by instructing Vale in the art of West African drumming.

McCarthy would be remiss if he did not throw a few antagonists into the mix. First, it's a bunch of mean undercover cops at the Central Park West/W. 72nd Street subway station who arrest Tarek for fare beating (even though they could have clearly seen he went through the turnstile AFTER paying the fare with his Metrocard). Worse villains emerge with the faceless Immigration and Custom Enforcement Agents who imprison Tarek in a Federal detention facility and threaten to deport him.

Soon afterward, Tarek's mother, Mouna, shows up from Michigan. Even though she presumably has a life there, she'll stay as long as it takes in New York City, to obtain the release of her son (apparently her job and her friends and relatives there are dispensable). Mouna is just as angelic as her son and his girlfriend. She enjoys drinking wine and listening to Phantom of the Opera (just before the film's climax, Dr. Vale is becoming more and more spontaneous and decides to take Mouna on a date to see an actual performance of 'Phantom').

While The Visitor is ostensibly about the goodness and healing power of the Muslim World (and the Third World in general), the underlying SUB-TEXT of the narrative is still of a decided Christian bent. Like Jesus Christ, Tarek must offer himself up as a sacrifice so that Dr. Vale (the depressed Western middle-class intellectual) can redeem himself. Through Tarek's 'sacrifice' (his deportation back to his native Syria), Vale can now vent his rage at Tarek's Centurion-like tormentors (no longer passive, he screams at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service officers inside the Detention center, signaling a complete catharsis). The Passion play would not be complete without the further sacrifice of the saintly Mouna (a modern day Virgin Mary?) who has also offered herself up on the sacrificial altar (she too is headed back to Syria). Vale is finally cleansed (baptized?) and as the camera fades out, our once depressed loser has become a spontaneous, self-actualized man of Christian charity--playing his Western African drums in the subway and in effect announcing to the world that not only is he spontaneous but also vibrantly tolerant.

There is nothing wrong in insisting that Americans treat outsiders with respect, compassion and tolerance if warranted. But let's not put such outsiders on a pedestal and at the same time, denigrate our own culture. If McCarthy was more honest, he would NOT have elevated his illegal immigrant characters to angelic status. By doing so, The Visitor sacrifices verisimilitude for propaganda and a skewed sense of reality.",1236988800,9,4260,5.104734576757532

I'm so out-of-touch with the Cinema that I didn't know this film was a quiet hit or that Jenkins was an Oscar nominee. I picked it up as a rental because an Israeli friend recommended it as a movie that depicted Palestinians in a humane light. I certainly didn't foresee that there'd be seventy five-star reviews already posted, including several insightfuls, like the one by Rebecca Kyle.

This is a film with two endings. The end of the story of Tarek and his mother, the Palestinians, is a tragedy and a shocking revelation of the callous mistreatment of today's ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" The end of the story of Walter, the clinically depressed and burned-out professor of economics, is a human triumph, a resurrection of the individual by way of empathy with a stranger. This dual outcome is what makes the film subtle and touching.

One of the one-star reviews already posted, by a gent from Pennsylvania, declares that the film had only one virtue, that it ended with the deportation of those vile illegal immigrants, and that the film has a 'political agenda.' I think it's worth remembering that even such shameful hate-swollen goons can vote in the USA, and influence the rules that determine people's lives.",1236470400,,1306,4.927272727272728

The acting is well done and believable.  I enjoyed the character development in the film.  But, at the end, I longed for a different ending.  I know that this film is much more true to life, but I am one of those people who often enjoys watching movies to escape real life and be encouraged.

I am writing this without notes in front of me but I must add that the young man in this movie that plays the ""drum"" is also most exceptional and conveys such charisma.

2428469,5,B000BN6M12,"Professor Walter Vale, a widower who has been sleeping his way through life in a job he doesn't care about, receives an unexpected awakening when he returns to his New York apartment one night to find a young immigrant couple has taken up residence there while he was away. He resigns to allow the couple to live with him, and as Walter's friendship with the male of the two, Tarek, grows through lessons in playing the African djembe drum, his passion for life becomes renewed. But Walter's uplifting new path takes a sharp and unfortunate turn when Tarek is arrested and held for being in the country illegally. Suddenly, we find ourselves in the midst of an unexpected struggle that is the heart of ""The Visitor"", and Walter is sure to never be the same.

Watching ""The Visitor"", it is easy to understand why Richard Jenkins was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his passionate portrayal of Walter Vale in this fine independent film. Putting the topical aspect aside, the film is truly well done and surprisingly not a bit dull (if you can sit through a movie without explosions or things of that nature). It moves at a fine pace and stays interesting with outstanding performances all around. Kudos to director Thomas McCarthy for his excellent work here. Bringing the social issue back into play however, we all know this is a touchy subject for a lot of people. The film presents a straightforward and realistic view of things, though be warned that it is definitely a specific point of view, and that is the unsurprisingly more pro-illegal immigrants/anti-immigration laws viewpoint. ""The Visitor"" does an excellent job at pointing out the unpleasant and some might say inhumane treatment of those detained for being ""illegals"". Still, it's important to see that there are reasonable gripes on both sides of an issue like this, but one can't really flaw a film for showing only one side of an issue if that is the side the story takes place on. So, again, overall this is an outstanding film. It is an emotional ride and, as I said, full of great performances, though Richard Jenkins is without a doubt the star. Richard's performance, however, is wonderfully complemented by that of Hiam Abbass as Tarek's mother, and their characters' relationship really takes the film to another level.

""The Visitor"" gets a nice DVD presentation here in anamorphic widescreen with full frame option, and there is a good director commentary with Richard Jenkins sitting in too. You also get a behind the scenes documentary, a featurette on the djembe drum, deleted scenes, and the film's trailer. If the immigration subject or the subject of a man trying to rediscover his passion and inner rhythm appeals to you, I can definitely recommend ""The Visitor"" for some fine performances in a well-made, touching and thought provoking film.",1235606400,,2833,4.887733887733888

In this sense, drums are metaphors for the rhythms of life. the music sublimely written by Jan Kacmarek is Oscar material. As are the script, directing and acting.

2428485,5,B000BN6M12,"""The Visitor"" is an exquisitely realized drama about an aging economics professor who receives a brand new lease on life.  Still grieving over the loss of his beloved wife, Walter Vale is a man who has taken to pretty much coasting through life, teaching the same mind-numbing courses semester after semester and  ""co-authoring"" a book that he knows little about due to the fact that he didn't actually do much to help write it. As the movie begins, Walter is sent by the New England college where he works to deliver a speech on that book at a conference in Manhattan.  When he arrives in the city, Walter is shocked to discover two illegal immigrants - a man from Syria and a woman from Senegal - living in the apartment he owns there (a friend of the couple having tricked them into believing that HE was the actual owner).  After some initial confusion and embarrassment occasioned by the misunderstanding, a warm relationship develops between Walter and the young man, Tarek, who repays Walter's kindness in allowing them to stay in the apartment by teaching him how to play the djimbe, a hand drum of West African origin.  Soon, however, Tarek finds himself in trouble with the immigration department which wants to deport Tarek back to his country of origin.  Moved by the plight confronting his new friend, Walter becomes the young man's chief advocate on the outside, trying to secure legal help for him and doing what he can to support Tarek`s understandably distraught mother and girlfriend through the crisis.

A barebones detailing like the one above could never hope to do full justice to the wonderful work of art that writer/director Thomas McCarthy (""The Station Agent"") has wrought from this material.  For what starts off as a story about one man's emotional and spiritual reconnection to life broadens out to become a heartbreaking look at the immigrant experience and the melting pot richness of American society.  Giving what is clearly one of the most beautifully controlled and thoughtful performances in recent memory, Richard Jenkins takes charge of the film from the very opening frame and never lets go, ever so subtly drawing us into the life and mind of this complex but genuinely decent man who finally finds something outside of his own humdrum existence worth caring about.  Devoid of histrionic flourishes of any kind, Jenkins' sensitive and understated performance becomes the perfect vehicle to guide us through this narrative.

Equally impressive are the three main supporting actors who contribute greatly to the emotional richness of the piece.  The engaging and charismatic quality Haaz Sleiman brings to the part of Tarek is crucial in making us understand just how it is that Walter is willing to go to bat for a man he has known for only a few days (and how refreshing it is to have an Arab character who is NOT an actual terrorist for a change!).  As Tarek's young Senegalese lover, Danai Jekesai Gurira undergoes a radical transformation throughout the course of her performance, playing a woman who is at first taciturn and suspicious through a learned sense of caution - then openhearted and giving once she realizes her suspicions about Walter are thoroughly without merit.  But it is Hiam Abbass who most captures our heart as Tarek's mother, a woman who believes fervently in the promise of the American Dream, but who knows only too well that, for some people, that dream can quickly turn into a gut-wrenching legal and bureaucratic nightmare, particularly in the post 9/11 world in which we now live.

""The Visitor"" plays like a delicately calibrated piece of music, with each element falling seamlessly into place to achieve its overall effect.  McCarthy's direction is sinewy and lyrical, while Oliver Bokelberg's cinematography bathes the film in a warmly lit, hue-filled glow.  The movie also captivates us with its view of an eclectic, multi-cultural urban landscape - one filled with the sights and sounds of a city alive to the possibility of human harmony and achievement in all its myriad diversity and richness.

Beyond being a superb human drama in its own right, ""The Visitor"" is also quite possibly the most artful and moving film about immigration to have come our way since ""El Norte"" - and every bit as remarkable.",1234742400,,4282,4.940111420612813

You sense that longing in him throughout the movie. I think it was best manifested in the scene in Central Park with his reluctance to join the drummers, but he eventually gives in to his yearning and joins the group.  Well acted.  Lovely scene.  Those instances like that, pushing his character further and further out of his shell, becomes more apparent throughout the film.

In the beginning his character was bored with his old life, disinterested but still obliging, simply going through the motions.  Towards the end of the movie, he out and out avoids everything to do with his old life and wholeheartedly embraces his new one with his new friends.  This subtle transformation through the entire film is Richard Jenkins' masterpiece. Wonderful acting.

2428507,4,B000BN6M12,"Walter Vale would retire if he could think of anything else to do. He's calling it in at work, recycling the syllabus of the undergraduate econ course he teaches by changing the year using correction fluid.  He's written three books and pretends to be working on a fourth. He and his classical pianist wife were successful enough to have kept their spacious (by NYC standards) apartment in New York when they moved to Connecticut to be closer to his job. There was probably an unspoken assumption between them that he would be the first to go. His wife's passing left Walter forlorn; every so often he tries to re-connect to his life with her by taking piano lessons, but he was not destined to play the piano.

Because he took a co-author credit on a paper he barely even read, he gets stuck having to go into New York to attend a conference and deliver the paper. When he arrives at his long-unused apartment, he discovers it has been fraudulently sub-let to an immigrant couple. The rest of the plot is well-documented elsewhere.

What sets this film apart and make it worth seeing it Richard Jenkins' award-winning performance as Walter. A lessor actor might have been tempted to lean toward the maudlin to make Walter more ""likable"" to audiences. American audiences in particular like their emotions Big on the screen. Jenkins internalizes Walter's personal pain and professional boredom and then lets it show through in Walter's appearance and expressions  of indifference and ennui. Jenkins has already won several awards for this role and has been nominated for several more, including an Academy Award. He deserves, even in this year's strong field in the best actor category, everything he wins.

Walter is a widower and a college professor locked in a life and career that no longer holds any meaning for him. He is comfortable, lonely and bored. When he is forced to attend a conference in New York City he returns to his apartment for the first time since the death of his wife and finds a young couple illegally subletting the place. As Walter comes to know the two illegal immigrants as well as the young man's mother, he once again discovers joy in life, friendship, and love. He also finds despair and the cold hard reality of a society living in fear in a post 9/11 world

The visitor is well acted and thought provoking. You will find yourself thinking about it for some time.",1231891200,,770,4.422535211267606
2428509,5,B000BN6M12,"There is something universally moving about the drama `The Visitor', which takes the tired `finding yourself' storyline and adds layers of poignancy that one does not often encounter in these films.  It feels awfully delicate, which only raises ones interested level and cements ones adoration.

This is a film that will speak to you.

The film centers around Professor Walter Vale, a relative shell of a man who has lost all meaning in his life since the passing of his wife.  He tries to find something, anything to stimulate him but he falls short every time.  When asked to attend a conference in New York he finds two illegal aliens living in his apartment.  Instead of putting them out of the street, Walter offers to allow them to live with him while they look for another place to live.  What happens next is a revelation in Walter's life, a rebirth, an awakening as he builds a friendship with this couple that reshapes his very existence.

`The Visitor' is a very quite yet very profound film about the inner person we keep locked away.  Walter grows gradually in his understanding of himself and allows the audience to grasp his strengths and weaknesses beautifully.

Richard Jenkins needs to be Oscar nominated.

Jenkins builds his performance with each passing scene, totally diving into Walter's very being and drawing out for us a layered and raw portrayal of a man who lost everything only to find that he hadn't even truly begun to live yet.  The final scene is heartbreaking and reaffirming at the same time for it cements in us the desire to come to know ourselves and be as true to our being as we can be.

The film also uses the controversial ideas behind immigration as a catalyst for the films major emotional revelations.  When Tarek (one of the aliens residing in Walter's apartment) is picked up by immigration and threatened with deportation we can see how this affects not just his family but also Walter, a man who most likely had never considered the unjust side of the system.  It challenges his faith in a system that is supposed to protect, to do what is right.

It makes you think.

In the end I found this to be one of the best films to be released this year; a truly remarkable story that is as engaging as it is important and one that will make you smile as much as it will make you cry.  There are few films that understand the balance in emotions and know how to craft themselves into something that is a treat for each sense.  `The Visitor' is one of those movies.",1231718400,,2504,4.56152125279642
2428510,2,B000BN6M12,"I play djembe drums and have studied classical cello so I was all primed to like this movie. What a letdown. The screenplay was so flimsy and lacking in originality and made some rookie mistakes that no amount of good acting can fix. First of all, this is essentially a story about characters who all seem to like each other and agree with each other all the time. That's great for real life, but makes for a boring story. The characters lack any real complexity. Everyone turns out to be exactly what they seem to be when we first meet them. No one grows or changes except the hero, and his change is entirely predictable - we know from early on this is going to be about the uptight white guy who meets some people from other cultures who are going to teach him to be more passionate and caring.

The dialogue is insufferably bad. People are always telling each other what we just saw happened in the previous scene. Or they're arranging to meet or call each other in the next scene. This is something beginning screenwriters do, it's called padding, and it means a screenwriter is looking for some way to put ink on the page but doesn't have anything interesting to say. In movie-making, every minute is precious and so any good writer knows not to waste an audience's time by retelling them something they just saw.

The story's villain is the US government bureaucracy that wants to deport our hero's friend who is an illegal alien. The friend had applied for asylum and was turned down, but we never learn whether his case was legit or why his application was denied. So what point is the screenwriter trying to make? Then we are told, second-hand, about the poor conditions of the detention center. But the first rule of screenwriting is show, don't tell, and we never actually get to see these conditions first-hand. Finally, at the end of the movie, and I'm not going to reveal what it is, we find out that maybe the government wasn't so much at fault as we were led to believe in wanting to deport the guy.

The plot is lame because, while the story is about getting the young man out of jail, we're told early on there's nothing the hero and his allies can do except wait for the attorney to do his thing. So instead of a story where things are actually happening, you have a story where the characters sit around worrying and waiting for something to happen. I rarely give a movie less than 3 stars, but I'm being generous here because the actors did their very best with weak material.

Oh and by the way, the screenwriter and director are doing a story about the power of music but didn't even bother to do the most basic musical research. There's a scene early on where the djembe African drummer tells the professor, you know classical music and that's in four. But in djembe, he says, you have to learn to play in three. First off, all classical musicians can play just as easy in 3 as they do in 4, there's absolutely no basis for his comment. Then the guy starts drumming, and guess what... the rhythms he's playing... it's in 4, even though he counts it out as if it were in three.",1231372800,19,3101,4.435087719298245

2428517,4,B000BN6M12,"The quirky little film deals very nicely with the questions of one college professor's mid-life crisis (a not unfamiliar problem to this reviewer and, I am sure, to the reader of this review and the audience for this film) and immigration in America in the post 9/11 world and various cross-cultural, if not multi-cultural concerns. As the story unfolds it seems that our professor craves some musical outlet to stave off those mid-life blues (and, additionally, get over his isolation due to the death of his wife). Presto- on a dreaded and fruitless trip to New York City  as a `sub' presenter at one of those never ending conferences that are central to and bedevil academic life he finds a musical muse, a Palestinian jazz drum aficionado, who also happens to be an illegal immigrant `squatting' in the good professor's apartment with his also illegal girlfriend.

Along the way the professor, through a fluke of bad timing inadvertently caused by him, learns the hard way the nature of the immigration problem, its seeming absurdities and its abuses. Hovering in the background is our drummer's deeply concerned mother, a very fetching mother to be sure. The professor and mother form an `alliance' to save her son from the horrors of the deportation process. To no avail and he is deported back to Syria. This deportation to Syria serves as a very useful metaphor concerning the plight of the Palestinian Diaspora and of the continuing non-resolution of the question of a Palestinian homeland.

Although, in the end, the only one who gets out with some resolution of his crisis is the professor we will not fault the creators of this film for that but rather the vagaries of the post 9/11 world, one George W. Bush and friends and a certain innate American xenophobia about immigrants- that is after one's own ethnic or racial group has `made' it to and in America. After viewing this film I have also become more confirmed in my belief that those who make it here to old immigrant-formed and built America should have full citizenship rights. Watch this film to see what I mean. Moreover watch this film for the taboo `romance' between the good WASP professor and his muse's sparklingly exotic mother.

2428518,5,B000BN6M12,"Far from flashy, gimmicky or megastar-studded, ""The Visitor"" is a quiet and touching film.  Right off the bat, I felt connected to the main character, Walter Vale, a lonely, widowed professor who's just going through the motions of life--not really engaging in it and passionless about most things.  It's as if he's marking time as quietly and as unobtrusively as he can for there's nothing left to excite or inspire him.  Fortunately, something unforeseen happens that reignites Walter's passion.

The ensuing relationship he develops with the young couple, Tarek and Zainab, who mistakenly rent Walter's apartment in New York, resonated with me quite profoundly.  After viewing, a few of us discussed if anyone would really go to the lengths Walter did to help someone else.  I truly believe that there are decent and selfless individuals who would do so.  What's remarkable about this film is how realistic the acting is (most especially that of Richard Jenkins of Six Feet Under fame), the kind where I get the sensation that I'm eavesdropping on real people.  There are political issues at the forefront of the story, but they're neither rammed down your throat nor trotted out for the sake of liberal posturing.  It's a moving, bittersweet film that's definitely worth the time and attention.",1229558400,3,1298,5.084905660377358
2428519,5,B000BN6M12,"This is a quiet, intensely felt and well observed film about how chance and small choices lead to life changes, happy and sad.  It's about very different people being thrown together.  It's about a husk of a man being drawn back into life.

Oh, and it has a political element about immigration.  If you think that may bother you, please read on--you have no real cause for worry.  No political view was harmed in the making of this movie.

Walter (Richard Jenkins) is a 62-year-old economics professor who is drained of life.  He takes piano lessons, perhaps in a vain effort to connect somehow with his deceased pianist wife, but he has no great talent and gets no joy from it; he teaches a class, but no one enjoys that; he doesn't really work on his book.

A chance occurrence takes Walter from his home in Connecticut to his apartment in New York City where, in an unexpectedly generous moment (which makes sense as presented), he gives place to two young immigrants, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman), a man from Syria who makes his living playing the djembe (an African drum), and girlfriend Zainab (Danai Gurira), a jewelry maker from Senegal.  Walter is drawn in by Tarek's drum and sunny open-heartedness, finding in the more elemental spirit of the drum what he lacked with the piano.  As Tarek teaches him to play, the juices of life begin to flow again.

Another chance occurrence lands Tarek in a detention center for undocumented immigrants.  From this point, about halfway into the film, the treatment of illegal immigrants becomes a theme.  This brings Tarek's mother, Mouna (Hiam Abbass) into the picture, whose presence furthers Walter's revival.

It may seem strange to say, but the political theme about the treatment of illegal immigrants, especially those from the Muslim world post September 11th, is one-sided but not unfair.  That is, because of the point of view of the movie, Walter's point of view, we only see a small part of the complex issues relating to immigration.  What we do see is presented accurately, without blaming anyone; there are no villains; no political stance or attitude is made to look bad; no hint of a political program is suggested as to how to deal with illegal immigrants.  This country, and New York City in particular, is presented as a vibrant, desirable place.  The only political act is to give the immigrant a sympathetic human face, and to show how implacable and dehumanized the immigration system can be.

The role of Walter was written for Jenkins, who was nominated for an Oscar for it--quite an accomplishment for a small, non-Hollywood film.  He starts off cold and doing some unsympathetic things, yet he manages to capture our sympathy.  I was especially impressed by Sleiman's perfectly natural and irresistible Tarek.  He makes not only his own role believable, but everyone else's--it's easy to see why others would interact with him as they do.  And I was struck by the understated beauty and power of Abbass, as Tarek's mother.  It's a pleasure just to see her on screen.  The other main role, Gurira's Zainab, is also drawn most effectively.

Writer/director Tom McCarthy, who is an actor himself, called on a lot of fine actors to play the small roles, so every character is interesting and engaging.

The audio commentary with McCarthy and Jenkins focuses mostly on how the film was made, with only the occasional remark about the meaning.  I found it interesting, but I learned more about the ideas behind and in the film in some of the many interviews with McCarthy and Jenkins I found online.  The Inside Look featurette is short and slight; the deleted scenes are also brief, but add a bit.  The featurette on playing the djembe includes interviews with the man who taught Sleiman, Jenkins and, before that, McCarthy himself to play, along with input from the actors.

One point that came up in many interviews I read, but is only barely touched on in the audio commentary, is the meaning of the title.  So as not to spoil anything I'll just suggest that it has many meanings through the film, so don't be stingy in applying it wherever it seems to fit.

This film is a treat for those who like character studies, especially ones that focus on the struggles, triumphs and losses of ordinary, basically good people.  It won't give anything away to say that the ending is both heartbreaking and hopeful.  Like the best movies of its kind, it made me feel more deeply who I am and what it is to be human.",1228435200,7,4469,4.752269779507134
2428520,5,B000BN6M12,"An interesting film about the very negative and inhumane consequences of the security policy that followed 9/11, though it was present already before. I got one of these famous letters giving you two weeks to leave the USA when I was in North Carolina, though I had been on a wrong visa for nine months and the immigration services knew about it and just tolerated it because I had to fulfill a contract that had been signed and the fault was that of a dumb bureaucrat in the US consulate in Bordeaux. 9/11 only increased the tension and made that policy a lot more systematic. But it is totally false to believe that this security policy is only trying to identify the illegal immigrants in the USA. The real aim is not to terrorize them (which it does of course), it is to really terrorize the potential illegal immigrants by treating those they catch like absolute manure: maybe like that a good proportion of them will not even envisage the trip. The point is not to control the flow but to keep it within reasonable limits because the millions of illegal immigrants are indispensable for the economy to go on working and be competitive. At the same time that enables labor costs to be brought down, hence to keep some rather high salaries at the top because at the bottom they are paid worse than slaves would be. At the same time the problem is a lot more complex than that. It is obvious that immigration would not be a problem if all countries in the world had the same chances to develop, which is not the case, and by developing I mean improve their lots at once economically, politically and culturally, if not psychologically and spiritually. What I consider the worst part of it is that these immigrants come into developed countries with the consumption requirements of their original living standards, just slightly improved, and thus they are able to live rather happily with very little, a lot lower than a fair proportion of us. The film is all the more interesting because it reveals that these immigrants are bringing in talents and qualifications that have little to do with the share of gross national product that enables them to live on the dream that they think is realized, though it is as precarious as precarious can be, like a sand castle on the tide line. In that particularly case it is music. In that particular case it also enables the university professor from Connecticut to admit that he is a pretender who is doing nothing in his life, teaching the same course he has been teaching for 25 years, writing books that are more or less nothing but patient pollen gathering that does not go beyond that and never reaches the level of honey, not to speak of royal jelly. But the end of the film is totally off the point. He has learned nothing after all, playing his drum in the Broadway-Lafayette Street subway station, when he should be playing in Central Park with all the other drum players because that's what this contact should have led him to: sharing and enjoying with fellow-travelers in life the passion they have in common. He has not come out of his solitude or pretence: he has just learned to live his solitude in public. That's very little.

There is more to Walter than his button-down exterior.  After a lesson in Central Park, Walter and Takek are returning home when a minor misunderstanding leads to Tarek's arrest.

2428537,4,B000BN6M12,"There are two kinds of good movies:  the kind you want to watch multiple times, and the kind that you will be glad that you saw once.  For me, this is the latter type.  The movie functions in two ways.  First, it is a political statement about immigration policy.  The main plot of the movie involves a good person who is well-integrated into American society after having lived here for many years.  However, his family over-stayed a visa without responding to a legal notice many years earlier.  Moreover, he is Middle Eastern, which introduces a variety of modern political issues.  He is detained by the police by mistake, arrested and deported to a country he hasn't seen since he was a child, and where he knows nobody.  If you support open borders, you will cheer the criticism of a Kafkaesque legal system that makes a mockery of the inscription on the Statue of Liberty.  If you support restrictive immigration policy, you will be offended by a sympathetic portrayal of someone who is actually a criminal.

However, the film works on another level as well.  While the story centers around immigration policy, it is told from the perspective of an Economics professor whose life becomes entangled with the deported Middle Easterner.  More than anything, the movie is a character study of that professor, who goes convincingly from being a rather pathetic and self-involved person to someone who actually starts to care about other people and finds some joy in his own life through African drumming.  Yes, an Econ. professor becomes obsessed with African drumming.  It is rather amusing how seriously the movie takes this given the conceptual absurdity (if you know any Econ. professors personally).  However, the movie does make you care about a man who seems completely unsympathetic at the beginning of the movie.

While this is a very good movie, it is not the type that lends itself to repeated viewing.  The kinds of movies I can watch multiple times are either visually interesting, or have great dialogue.  There is little of visual interest here (aside from the absurdity of a middle-aged Econ. professor in a drum circle), and the dialogue, while realistic, is not engrossing for its own sake.  If you can watch subtle character studies over and over again, you might find this one appropriate for repeated viewing, but most of the art house movie crowd will appreciate seeing this once and only once.",1227052800,,2418,4.894348894348894

2428539,4,B000BN6M12,"At the start of The Visitor, Richard Jenkins (Cheaper by the Dozen) is your typical burned out professor who just white outs the term and year on the syllabus, and only if he remembers. Criticism isn't his strong suit either as he has been through five piano teachers without a second lesson. Just your typical mid life crisis, but about ten years after he should have grown out of it.

All that changes when he has to go to a conference in New York City and a couple has taken up residence in his apartment there in his absence. Instead of calling the police like a normal person, Jenkins, longing for some human contact out of the norm and let the two Muslims stay. In Haaz Sleiman (American Dreamz), Jenkins finds a teacher that doesn't just dismiss him learning the djembe (a Syrian drum) at such an old age.

This first half of the film is as exhilarating as Jenkins taking up the foreign instrument with plenty of great music that moves the movie along. But not surprising considering the origins of the house guests, the second half delves into a heavy handed commentary on the immigration policies in a post-9/11 world. Even during the first half, you know it is coming, but you wish they would have just stayed with the uplifting story of bring people together with music.",1226966400,,1281,4.565217391304348
2428540,5,B000BN6M12,"Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins), an insular, lonely economics professor at an upscale Connecticut college, is tapped by his superiors to present a paper at a conference in New York City, though he resists as strongly as he is able. He very reluctantly complies, only to find himself jarred out of his complacent misery when he arrives in New York by finding squatters in the apartment he has maintained for many years. The pair, a Senegalese woman (Danai Gurira) and her Syrian boyfriend (Haaz Sleiman),both illegal aliens, have sublet the apartment from a total stranger.  Walter's reaction, after a great deal of thought, is to take them in until they can find suitable lodgings.  The movie progresses deceptively slowly...you imagine more time has passed than actually happens...and the relationship between the three evolves naturally and believeably. Tarek, the man from Syria, takes an instant liking to his benefactor and when Walter exhibits an interest in Tarek's talent (playing the djembe, an African drum), Tarek turns Walter into the most incongruous member of a drum circle in Central Park. Only Zaineb, the Senegalese woman, shows real wariness; she's been involved in troubles to do with immigration before, and she doesn't totally trust Walter for a long time, until circumstances force her to admit that Walter has a true friendship for both of his impromptu lodgers.  Very few movies in the past few years have brought me to tears, but this movie is so beautifully wrought and staged, with unsurpassed acting from everyone involved, that I cannot recommend it highly enough. It will touch your heart in ways that you did not think possible.",1226880000,,1657,5.107011070110701

2428542,5,B000BN6M12,"I was so amazing impressed by the Station Agent that I saw it twice and was thrilled when I heard that Thomas had directed another movie.  If anything the visitor was better.  Both were such human portrayals of friendship, goodness, and brokenness.  Unlike any other American filmmaker I know of, Thomas McCarthy has an uncanny ability to empathize with the human condition with his films (is that too abstract of a praise?).  Anyway, I hope he makes many more films (but never becomes famous).  I will watch every one.

Btw, Does anyone know what his next directorial project will be?",1226707200,,585,4.8
2428543,5,B000BN6M12,"""The Visitor"" tells the story of Walter, a college professor who is going through the motions of his empty academic life.  The early scenes of the movie show you Walter's loneliness--he eats alone, lives alone--but there are obvious echoes of happier times in his life.  On a chance visit to NYC he discovers two illegal immigrants that have illegally sublet his apartment.  On a whim, he lets them stay, and they slowly bring him back to life.  Just when the movie starts to cheer up--the unlucky happens--one of the immigrants is arrested.  The rest of the film is heart-wrenching, but well worth the watch.

This movie is excellent.  The writing is great, and the acting is understated in a way that feels authentic.  You really empathize with these characters as their world is torn apart.  Although the film has a very negative portrayal of the US Government and US Immigrations, you can understand why the characters are so frustrated with the system.  This is certainly a film that will get you thinking, and after watching it, I understand the praise it has received in the press.

I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a real human interest story.  The movie is very moving, whatever your views on the larger immigration issue.",1226620800,,1249,4.812206572769953

2428555,5,B000BN6M12,"I just finished watching The Visitor.  I have to say it was tough to watch at first but I knew it had to get better and better.  I was not tricked by all the positive reviews, they were right for the most part.

The Visitor starts off in a very somber mood but Walter (main character) grows more and more.  It is the story of a depressed individual looking for something in his life more than he has.  The movie made you feel the way Walter felt in a sense.  It did a great job of passing the feeling on to the viewer.

Eventually Walter finds joy in helping out his unexpected ""Visitor's"".  Three things that you will find in this movie.  Music brings Joy,  Friendship brings Joy, and the first inkling of love brings Joy.  Though I would say most people may be dissappointed by the ending, the ending is actually real life.  Sometimes things don't always end up happily ever after.  It is tough because we aren't used to seeing this 100% resolved but finally a movie gives us a piece of real life.

I think if you buy this movie it is one you will recommend to others.  It is an unexpected 5 star flick.  That I hope you take the time to enjoy.",1226361600,,1146,4.211981566820277
2428556,4,B000BN6M12,"""The Visitor"" is entertaining and thought-provoking, and perhaps argument-provoking, too, depending on your view of the immigration issue.  Basically, if you've read the reviews, you've seen the movie: fate throws together a sleepwalking-through-life college professor and two illegal immigrants, with the professor and the immigrants growing in various ways from their unlikely friendship.  The predictability of the premise isn't fatal to the proceedings by any means, as it's nice to see the humanity of the characters unfold, especially as their situations become more difficult.  I've always responded to kindness in movies (a moment of genuine kindness is more likely to make me tear up than a moment of sadness), and there's a lot of kindness on display here.

Also, any predictability is offset by several small touches, grace notes, and non-predictable elements: the immigrants aren't uneducated and helpless (they're quite worldly, in fact), just regular people in a bad situation; Richard Jenkins' professor character Walter Vale isn't totally lost and messed up at the film's start, just a good man who's drifted into making his routine control his life instead of vice versa (a fate most of us can be subject if we're not careful); and the acting across the board is deep and resonant, as two or three things seem to be going on in the characters' minds and on their faces even during black-and-white situations where one response (anger, happiness, etc.) would have been fine.

The DVD features a warm, rich image and sharp sound that does justice to the musical aspect of the film, which is considerable.  Special features include the film's trailer, a tiny little ""behind the scenes"" featurette (about five minutes), a tiny deleted scenes section (also about five minutes), and an interview with the drum expert who helped coach the actors (maybe about six or seven minutes).  There's also a commentary track.

I watched ""The Visitor"" a day or two after Barack Obama's historic victory in the presidential election, so maybe the hopefulness of that dramatic night made me see the movie- even with all the sadness and disappointment the characters feel, especially during the movie's latter half- as ultimately a hopeful reminder that, if we want to, we can reach out in a multicultural world and find solutions to our problems and challenges.",1226275200,,2358,5.186842105263158
2428557,2,B000BN6M12,"It is indeed gratifying that veteran and highly skilled supporting player Richard Jenkins is given the lead for this film.  It is additionally unfortunate that the work is not so much a drama as it is a polemic espousing the cause of immigrants illegally residing within the United States, with virtual sermons upon the subject comprising a portion of the dialogue.  If one hasn't a theoretic point of view allied with that of the production team, its quality of didacticism may appear to be a trifle starry-eyed.  Jenkins plays as Walter Vale, a somewhat fuddled college professor whose work ethic has gradually disappeared, and who has failed at attempts at adapting to the death of his wife six years past, the role as bromidic as are those of the other major characters, and of the Forces of Evil, essentially depicted here by United States immigration officials.  A viewer's life experience may have led to a conclusion that most college and university professors are not quite as softheaded as Vale, particularly in light of his ostensible incompetence, regardless of political positioning, and notably when removed from the groves of academe.  Yet Jenkins, thanks to his acting expertise, makes Vale all asea by life in general, although he does rivet upon learning to pound atop the djembe, a type of African drum, even to the point of demonstrating his newly developed musical talent in a highly public place.  This represents a remarkable personality shift for the formerly bloodless Walter, he having received a transfusion of vitality from his illegally situated new friends, and is perhaps the film's silliest episode.  Most of the work, however, is too self-consciously serious to permit such dottiness.  Performances by the cast are uniformly well-created throughout, and while most of the featured actors will probably be seldom seen after this, the familiar face of Jenkins will undoubtedly be screened often, once again in supporting roles, a status that some viewers might prefer after seeing this piece.  The film is directed and acted very well indeed, and benefits from highly competent post-production editing, all in service to a hackneyed scenario.",1226188800,6,2173,5.168091168091168
2428558,5,B000BN6M12,"I'm always up for a good story when it comes to movies and The Visitor certainly is no exception.  It's a classic tale of East meets West against the backdrop of our War on Terror and Immigration Policy (such as it is).

The story is simple, yet elegant.  A ROAD (Retired On Active Duty) college professor is just surviving life.  He teaches only one class, rarely works on his book, considers reading a book ""co-authoring,"" and just cannot seem to find his niche in life.  His life changes dramatically when he is forced to attend a conference in NYC to discover strange guests residing in his summer apartment.  I won't give away the rest but the rest of the movie addresses our immigration policy and how we treat illegal immigrants and refugees.

Despite the story's simplicity, it flows fairly well and is quite compelling.  Between the initial friction of the stranger's girlfriend and the professor, the musical tastes of the stranger, and how the professor finds redemption in the most unlikely way (sorry guys, get the movie if you wanna know the rest *RASPBERRY*), the audience has plenty of elements to become involved with and feel a personal connection in some way.

Now, some people I watched The Visitor with had some concerns over the preachiness of the movie itself involving our immigration policy since the majority of the film focuses around the injustice of how we, as a nation, treat detained illegal immigrants.  I agree that the movie is preachy to a certain degree, however, I can also see how The Visitor is also a critique on how we treat refugees (although some will argue there is not difference).  If anything, illegal immigrants escaping Senegal and Syria can be considered political refugees given the volatile situations there now.

Either way, at least the film doesn't distinguish between party lines like many in Hollywood have in recent years, which alienates audiences.  They just distinguish between immigrants/refugees and naturalized citizens.

Now, on to the technical aspects.

The musical accompaniment was lovely.  I don't remember exactly the names of the composers but there was a great deal of classical music and piano works.  While it is almost exclusively public domain selection, it fits perfectly in the scenes whether it's the mother of the stranger cleaning the apartment (which was surprisingly a beautiful scene), or the professor slumping to dinner at his home in Connecticut.

The camera work was non-distracting, which is always a plus.  I cannot stand it when directors try ""new"" things and end up ruining it for the rest of us.  As far as camera and editing goes, it was very nondescript, which is the way it should be for simplistic movies.  This is not to demean the film; it actually pulled off a simplistic, yet elegant, performance.

All in all, The Visitor is an excellent movie.  It was much better than I anticipated it would be.  I would recommend this for anyone seeking a good drama, a film on multi-culturalism, or need an uplifting tale of a down-and-out man finding redemption.

The writing and acting are excellent. The tone of the movies starts off a bit slow but quickly engages you. The character development is really first class and I found myself coming to care about the people involved.

This movie is about more than entertainment. It will educate and make you think. Avoid it if you prefer to be lazy... Illegal immigration is not something that I have given a lot of thought to but this movie really sparked my imagination on that subject; as I'm sure it will yours.

My one biggest issue with this movie is the way it ended. I won't give it away, but I will tell you this: I kept imagining ways that it could end but none of those things are what happened. I found myself wanting more closure.",1225929600,,896,4.3532934131736525
2428560,3,B000BN6M12,"This was a sad story of friendships and a family broken apart.  Had too many dead spots and the film could have been shortened by 15 to 20 minutes. I don't think we needed the parts about playing the drums in your underwear, especially seeing the professor do it also.  The professor was a pretty patheic person and I would like to think it was because of the death of his wife.  I remember Tarek in the detention center saying he had done nothing wrong. I saw several things he had done wrong, 1)Illegally in this country. 2)Living in someone else's apartment, 3)Fled Michigan after his deportation hearing and 4)Not paying taxes on the income he earned.  The film tries to paint the United States as evil because we can't accept ALL the worlds downtrodden people.  The people who came to this country legally and followed the proper procedures ought to be appaulded and NOT the law breakers. The rest of the world would love for all their undesirables to leave their country.  In Syria if you were in the country illegally death or immediate deportation is what would have happened to Traek not months of legal red tape in our country.  Tarek did not like the detention center in Queens I bet it was a palace compared to any detention center in Syria. They made the guards look bad.  I don't think anyone was beaten or starved!

2428563,4,B000BN6M12,"This is a fine arthouse film about a quiet, isolated man who finds strength and a new voice when he finally discovers how to connect with others. Walter Vale is a burnt-out, widowed college professor whose specialty -- which he's long since bored with -- is the globalization of the economy. Real-life globalization enters his life when he visits his semi-abandoned New York apartment and finds two people -- both illegal aliens -- living there. They aren't quite squatters, since a ""friend"" told them they were subletting the flat, but no one is as surprised as Walter to find them there. Breaking out of his closed-down routine, Walter allows them to stay, and an unlikely friendship emerges. Walter, who had been trying to learn to play piano, in homage to his deceased wife, now finds himself drawn to African drumming, and gains an able tutor in Tarek, a charming, affable Syrian refugee who is one of the two squatters.  As the film settles into a potentially cliched can-the-white-guy-find-his-groove story arc, disaster hits and Tarek runs afoul of Homeland Security and the INS, and the movie becomes a subtle political advocacy film. What saves it from tedium or cliche are the small emotional moments that fill each frame -- this is a quiet story about the power that simple decency and humanity can add to our lives, especially in the face of implacable social and historical pressures. It's a nice, thoughtful film, worth checking out!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1225584000,,1485,4.959839357429719
2428564,3,B000BN6M12,"I'm in two minds regarding Thomas McCarthy's ""The Visitor.""  On one hand, the movie is a very well-acted, low-key character drama.  On the other hand, I found the blatant political agenda intolerable in its one-sidedness.

Richard Jenkins plays college professor Walter Vale.  Walter returns to his New York City apartment for the first time in months to find - to his understandable shock - a young couple has taken up residence there.  An unscrupulous landlord has rented out Walter's fully furnished apartment as if it were a vacant unit.  Rather than turn the couple out on the streets - something the man and woman are willing and ready to do - Walter allows them to share the place with him.  The man is from Syria and the woman from Senegal.

Walter is a complex and carefully drawn character.  His pianist wife has passed away sometime in the recent past, and he has become a frustrated musician - trying to learn piano as a way to remain connected to her.  He is coasting in most areas of his life.  As a tenured professor, he barely puts any effort into his job.  He is emotionally closed off and quite miserable in general.  But something about the plight of this young immigrant couple stirs a compassionate part of him that has been dormant for sometime.  He makes it his mission to be as generous as possible in helping these people.

Turns out that the couple are illegal aliens.  They are fully aware of the risks.  Both are intelligent and educated.  Both are creative artists (the girl creates jewelry to sell, the man is a percussionist who performs regularly).  Neither have any criminal background.  But Tarek, the Syrian man, has ignored the procedures that could have established a legal right to be in the country.  His mother is illegal as well, and she is largely responsible for Tarek's plight - having taken the poor advice of other illegals with blatant disregard for the immigration process.

Before anyone gets the wrong idea, let me make it clear:  I fully support legal immigration to the United States, from anywhere else in the world.  I realize there are problems with the system as it presently operates.  And I detest the fact that so many businesses in the U.S. employ illegals and go unpunished.  I don't blame anyone for attempting to live, work, and raise their families in the greatest country on planet Earth.  I realize that many countries in the world are hellholes with oppressive regimes, and the problems within the U.S. pale by comparison.  There's nothing wrong with people trying to seek asylum here rather than have their human rights trampled in their own country.  But there are laws that should be followed as well.

""The Visitor"" crosses the fine line, at least to some degree, between being a character-based piece of storytelling and political screed.  It is important to remember that people who live and work in the country without documentation are comitting a criminal act.  Not all of the millions of illegal aliens currently in the U.S. are productive contributors who mean no harm.  That's not to say they are all terrorists or all are lazy or all are violent criminals (though, of course, there are some that fall squarely into each category).  We have enough people meaning to either do harm to the U.S. in some way and/or drag down the economy via non-productivity that are LEGALLY entitled to be here.  Call me old-fashioned, but you can't just squat in the U.S. and expect to be considered an American.  You have to earn it, as so many million immigrants have done (and continue to do) over the years.

""The Visitor"" carefully stacks the deck in such a way that it is virtually impossible not to feel great sympathy for Tarek, his girlfriend, and his mother.  But to me, it became a bit manipulative by presenting these characters as flawless.  I enjoyed the movie primarily for Jenkins excellent work as he shows Walter reclaiming a sense of purpose for his life.  He develops a relationship with Tarek's mother that demonstrates he is moving forward with his life, perhaps for the first time since his wife's passing.

The treatment of the illegals within the detention center isn't really dealt with.  Tarek complains to Walter that they don't allow him to go outside - hey, he's lucky to not be in jail.  How does he think Walter would be treated if he decided to set up illegal residence in Syria?  Hopefully if there was a sequel, we'd see Walter take up the cause of helping inform immigrants of the proper way to become legal - rather than assuming anyone should be above the law.",1225584000,11,4559,4.730964467005077
2428565,4,B000BN6M12,"How do you make a movie about a middle-aged widower suffering from depression without depressing the audience? This movie has a very arresting premise and a truly important message for all of us, but I did not quite believe in the central character Walter Vale nor in the actor (Richard Jenkins) playing the role. When the movie ended with a symbolic life-affirming action, I believed in him less. The movie was an earnest, well-meaning film: the character too was an earnest well-meaning, well-intentioned man, but he didn't click for me.
 He's lonely. He goes to his all-but abandoned apartment in the city and discovers that a couple, a man from Syria and his girlfriend from Senegal are staying there. He lets them stay, and therein begins his transformation from a lonely inner-directed person to a compassionate person interested in others. His new friend teaches Walter how to play the drums, and this becomes the opening-up of his personality. The Syrian man gets arrested, is about to be deported; his mother comes to visit, and Walter falls in love with the mother.
 It seems like a low-budget indie movie that has an important message to convey, but Walter didn't ring true to me, perhaps because the actor, though competent, may have been miscast.
We are a country of immigrants. No man is an island, and we should not be intolerant of or opposed to immigrants who have something to add to our society. Friendships, relationships, new discoveries, awakenings within the person can often lead people out of depression.

2428566,4,B000BN6M12,"This film allowed me to view the immigration debate, and all emotions any immigrant experiences, from a different angle. These characters were united through a sad random occurence and the film unfolds in a subtle, and sad manner. The ""visitor"" is played by all characters in turn; there are many references which turn ""home"" and ""accomplishment"" on its head.

Instead of a black and white debate, where immigrants in the US illegally are condemned and shunned, the film charactgerizes their lives in the US, as real people, and the reasons these characters take turns ""visiting"" their own lives (going back to Syria, how one experiences his/her true roots), and how the characters share commonality regardless of their origins. Most significantly for me, was the fact that it depicts a character that is here in the US legitimately, and still doesn't feel like he ""belongs"" and has control over his own life, struggling with a monotonous existence, and having abandoned his passions, and another character who is very passionate, and for whom music is his main artery. Lastly it flips the stereotype of what kind of people play music in subway stations and parks, on its head. The lead character was an accomplished professor, who then ends up reattaching himself to his passion,and playing in the subway. The film challenges notions of accomplishments and what it means to have ""arrived"", physically, economically and spiritually.

The acting was a bit flat, and the outcome very tragic, albeit realistic given the circumstances. Give it a rent-has more to it, than you think-happy to have added it to my collection,",1225411200,,1618,5.078947368421052
2428567,5,B000BN6M12,"There are so many great qualities about THE VISITOR that it's tough to know where to start. I guess the first thing to mention might be the fact that it's an independent film that got only scattered showings across the States. It plugged away for about 19 weeks at small, indie cineplexes and churned out a surprising $10 million dollars. Chump change for big budget films like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-series/dp/B000UR9T8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man series</a>, but for something that cost around $1 million to make, that's quite a hefty return for an indie. Although dollars don't always add up to successful (or even good) cinema, it does show this film had legs and kept on sprinting along with other big budget summer flicks (it came out in April of 2008). I'd always wondered why it remained so long at my local art theater, but just never got around to seeing it. So when I saw its release on DVD, I swept in and picked up a copy to see what the hubbub was all about.

Well, the quiet accolades were definitely deserved. The Visitor ranks up there as one of my favorite films this year. Why? Because it's topical, well-acted (by many unknowns), and filmed in simple measures that allow the story to unfold without smacking the audience in the face with a blatant message.

The star of the show is Richard Jenkins, and he's the most familiar face you'll see. Known as the quirky dead dad in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under-series/dp/B000HEVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under series</a>, and appearing this year in the Cohen brothers' dark comedy hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burn-After-Reading/dp/B0017AORV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burn After Reading</a>, Jenkins pulls off the role of a lifetime.  Professor Walter Vale (Jenkins) is just going through life's motions. He cares for nothing since his wife passed away, giving boring lectures and repetitive tests to his students. Forced to leave town for New York City in order to give a speech about a book he coauthored (which he didn't coauthor), Walter steps into his small apartment only to find two strangers living there without his knowledge.  Tarek (Haaz Sleiman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B000VWLMEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>) and his girlfriend Zainab (newcomer Danai Jekesai Gurira) were duped into renting the apartment by a slimy friend, and once Walter arrives they are forced to leave.

Tarek is a Syrian while Zainab is a native of Africa and the two seem an odd pairing but are obviously in love. And Tarek's other love, his drums, are what bring him and his girlfriend back into Walter's fold. The thing Walter remembers most about his deceased wife is her love of music, and the opening scene of the film gives us some hidden insights into Walter's need to stay connected to her (he tries to learn the piano but simply isn't very good at it). But Tarek introduces him to his African drum and Walter's mind begins to awaken. They play together in the apartment and in Central Park. Walter shirks everything he thought might be dear to him and follows Tarek around, watching him play at various venues. But then tragedy strikes. In a post 9/11 world, anyone who looks like Tarek is a suspect, so when a mistake at a subway turnstile turns into a legal matter, Walter learns some disturbing news: Tarek and Zainab are illegals. Feeling as if he's losing another piece of himself (similar to the way he felt about losing his wife), Walter comes to their aid, hiring an immigration attorney and trying his best to get Tarek released.
The ante gets upped further when Tarek's mother (Hiam Abbass,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paradise-Now/dp/B000E0OE44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paradise Now</a>) arrives and wants to know what's going on with her son (whom she hasn't heard from since his incarceration). Walter breaks the bad news to her, and she and Walter strike up a gradual personal relationship that pulls down many barriers (from political to social).

It is a serious credit to this film that it takes on issues of the post 9/11 world and shows us the problems with our overly fearful homeland security system. Tarek is a hard worker, wanting only a fresh start in a country of opportunity, but is given none because of the color of his skin, the lilt of his voice, and the name of his country. Likewise for Zainab. And for Mouna (Tarek's mother). And when Walter tries to get involved, the authorities see him as some fly who deserves to be swooshed away.

The acting is stellar and the audience really begins to care about these people on the inside, allowing us to ignore their skin colors and strange accents. It has a powerful message - especially during one scene where we see Walter (white guy), Zainab (black) and Mouna (brown) walking side-by-side - and one that will probably remain with the audience long after they leave the theater (or finish the DVD).

He returns to his apartment in New York City after a long absence to discover a married couple living in it with immigration problems. They are not the typical illegal aliens, however. They had applied for political asylum and were denied, and then allowed to drift in legal limbo, more or less. Walter allows them to stay in his apartment with him and develops a great firendship with them. Due to a misunderstanding, the husband gets himself arrested and becomes tangled in his immigration problems. The story takes a few unusual twists, but builds steadily in emotional intensity and sensitivity. There are also a few well done special features, such as a ""making of"" documentary and a movie commentary track. If you like quiet, well made, realistic, emotional dramas, you will enjoy this.",1225324800,,894,4.8881578947368425
2428569,5,B000BN6M12,"The '08 release `The Visitor' is a thoughtful, poignant reflection on Post 9/11 America and its impact on those who would wish to immigrate to this country. Richard Jenkins is superb as Walter, a university professor from Connecticut who has drifted into a deep melancholy since the death of his wife. Walter is sent to New York to present a paper at an academic conference and while he's there befriends two illegal immigrants, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) a Syrian and his Senegalese girlfriend Zainab (Danal Gurira).

Walter is invigorated by his friendship with Tarek and begins playing the drum under Tarek's skilled instruction. However it's more than the three beat rhythm of the third world that Walter is becoming immersed in. When his Syrian is arrested by immigration and faced with imminent deportation Walter learns first hand the struggle and heartache of families and individuals seeking a new life in the U.S.A.

I have only praise for this film; production values, storyline, music and most of all a terrific cast which includes one of my favorite actresses Haim Abbass in the role of Mouna, Tarek's mother. It may be a little slow for some viewers, its pacing has the feel of a foreign film but it's worth the time and effort.",1225238400,,1236,4.880952380952381
2428570,5,B000BN6M12,"Walter Vale is a burnt-out college teacher living in Connecticut, who, at this point in his career, is simply going through the motions.  Recently a widower, Walter is a quiet reserved man who keeps to himself and doesn't have much passion for anything in life these days.  He begrudgingly accepts the task of going back to his hometown of New York City in order to give a lecture on a paper he co-authored, but didn't really work much on.  When he arrives at his old apartment, which he hasn't been back to in years, Walter is surprised to find a man and woman already living inside.  The two want no trouble and agree to leave, but Walter, feeling bad for them, agrees to allow them to stay.  It turns out that both are illegal immigrants.  Zainah, the woman, is very quiet and reserved, and keeps a cool emotional distance from Walter.  On the other hand, Tarek, her boyfriend, is quite open and kind with Walter, who shows an interest in the instrument he plays, an African drum known as the djembe.  Tarek begins to teach Walter how to play and the two soon become fast friends.

Unfortunately things get ugly for Tarek.  He is arrested, while entering the local subway with Walter, and taken to a detention center for illegal immigrants, where he could wind up being deported.  Despite pressures from his boss to return to Connecticut, Walter agrees to stay in New York City in order to help.  Eventually he meets Tarek's mother, Mouna, who after not hearing from her son, journeys from her home in Michigan to find out what has happened.  She and Walter become close as the two do everything they can to help Tarek get released.

Writer/Director Tom McCarthy, who already showed his expertise for the intricacies of interpersonal relationships with his previous film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Station-Agent/dp/B0001WTWDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Station Agent</a>, does so again here with The Visitor.  Except now another element has been added to the mix, which is the heavier theme of illegal immigrants living in the United States.  This theme is handled very well, in an honest and straightforward manner.  The acting in the film is first-rate.  Richard Jenkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under/dp/B00006NT1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under</a>) does a fine job as Walter Vale, showcasing a man whose empty life has now found hope and meaning.  Newcomers, Haaz Sleiman (Tarek) and Danai Gurira (Zainah) are also very effective in their roles too as the struggling couple, hoping to remain together.  Haaz's work with Richard Jenkins, in particular, is quite strong and effective.  But the icing on the cake has got to be Hiam Abbass (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Syrian-Bride/dp/B000EHQ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Syrian Bride</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paradise-Now/dp/B000E0OE44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paradise Now</a>) as Mouna, who plays Tarek's mother so beautifully; it's like watching an actor at the top of their game.  Her scenes with both Richard and Danai are simply wonderful.

Special Features Include:

Audio Commentary - with Writer/Director Tom McCarthy & Actor Richard Jenkins.  (Good commentary, though Richard Jenkins says very little.  Tom McCarthy explains why so many American flags wind up being seen in the film)

""An Inside Look At The Visitor"" (4:48) - a short behind the scenes look at the making of the film, with interviews from Writer/Director Tom McCarthy, and Actor's Richard Jenkins, Haaz Sleiman, and Danai Gurira.  (Nice, but should have been much longer.)

""Playing The Djembe"" (7:48) - a delightful featurette on the use of the djembe drum in the film, with interviews by Djembe Coach, Mohammed Naseehu Ali, Writer/Director Tom McCarthy, and Actor's Richard Jenkins (who actually played drums at a young age) & Haaz Sleiman (who never played drums at all until working on this film.)

Deleted Scenes [w/optional audio commentary] (Total Time 3:20):

""American Grill With Karen"" (0:48) - this scene shows Walter stopping off at a bar and grill, while in Connecticut, and coming into contact with and old flame from his past.

""Cocktails At The Conference"" (0:22) - a quick scene of Walter at the conference, with Writer/Director Tom McCarthy's brother-in-law, John, and brother, Steve playing his associates.

""Omar Says Hello"" (0:56) - a friend of Tarek's greets him and Walter while they're eating at a falafel stand.

""Jacob Meets Mouna"" (1:14) - Walter's neighbor, Jacob, is introduced to Mouna.  This was actor Richard Kind's second scene in the film, which was cut for pacing.  It further highlights the character's isolation as well as his need for companionship.

Original Theatrical Trailer (2:32)

This is a very enjoyable character based film that lives up to the praise it has received.  Having seen and been impressed by both this film and The Station Agent, I look forward to Tom McCarthy's next project.  He is a fine writer and director.

2428571,5,B000BN6M12,"""The Visitor"" is the kind of film we need everyone to watch at least once.  It could change the world in a matter of hours.  Tom McCarthy has created a piece of art that is at times magnificent, always graceful, and never misses.

Most of the movies to which I would give five stars probably have more great vs. not so good moments.  But for ""The ""Visitor,"" I'm still trying unsuccessfully to think of any short sequence, or even a frame that was not outstanding, or failed to add to the story.

Not long into ""The Visitor,"" I began to see that each scene had a significant theme, personality, sound, and visual impact.  Many of these scenes could have successfully stood by themselves as shorts.  Taken together as a sequence of wonderful little vignettes, they made for a very emotional experience.

As a private person with an academic background, it was very easy for me to imagine myself in the role played brilliantly by Richard Jenkins.  He makes the highly praised acting of Bill Murray in ""Lost in Translation"" look just average.

I love the writing, acting and especially the cinematography.  Several times I leaned over to my wife and whispered, ""that was good writing.""  And even now, several days later, I still recall some of the great images in the film, such as the image of that bunker-like immigration jail, or seeing Richard Jenkins through multiple panes of reinforced glass, or behind the criss-crossing subways. Some of the scenes were just incredible - like when the shallow tourist buys the bracelet, or when Tarik's mother lays down with Jenkins (it breaks your heart), or when the immigration clerk asks Jenkins to step away from the glass.  I could go on and on.  These were brilliant moments.

Immediately after seeing it for the first time, I decided to experience it again without sound. I don't mean to take anything away from the wonderful score, which was very powerful and important to the film.  But I wanted to watch the images.  Then, I watched it again without looking, just listening to the score, the sounds, and the voices of the actors.  I can tell you, the respective sights and sounds of ""The Visitor"" are so good, that it still succeeds without one or the other.

Illegal immigration is a very emotional topic for millions of Americans who will never have any understanding of reality for illegals of today, or illegals of the past (their ancestors?).  I'm sure someone could write a film about illegal aliens who, once they are here, commit crimes or who sit around collecting government benefits. Perhaps in some cases that is true.  But I will end this review as I started it.  If we could somehow get everyone on earth to watch ""The Visitor,"" we would all benefit from the experience of understanding a little reality about someone who is different than ourselves, and make this a better place to live, wherever we live.",1225065600,,2869,4.730382293762576
2428572,5,B000BN6M12,"Someone please give Richard Jenkins an Oscar nomination!  He's done such great, understated work over the years, whether in dramatic roles (NORTH COUNTRY) or in broad comedies (BURN AFTER READING).  He's an amazing actor, because he always seems like a real person that you might actually meet in real life.  (Well, maybe not in STEP-BROTHERS, where no one behaved like a human.)  He's got a craggy face and an a normal physique.  Yet, as we saw in SIX FEET UNDER, he can peel back layer after layer of big surprises.

In THE VISITOR, Richard Jenkins gets a role that was simply made for him.  He's cast as the lead, and he takes this unfamiliar burden (he is in every scene of the film) and brings it home with quiet power.  It's a well-written and directed film from Tom McCarthy (who also served those roles for the excellent THE STATION AGENT), but without Jenkins, I'm not sure the film would have been the success it was.

Jenkins plays a widowed college professor who has long since given up on finding meaning in his work and life.  He's clearly bored with teaching, no longer writes and is basically coasting through life making as little impact on anything as possible.  He's actually trying to learn to play the piano, but is clearly frustrated with the rigidness this demands.

Much to his chagrin, he's forced to leave his Connecticut home to present a paper at NYU.  He returns to his seldom visited New York City apartment, only to find a young couple are unwittingly squatting there.  They've been paying rent to the person they THOUGHT owned the place.  Jenkins initially accepts their offer to leave, but in a tiny burst of humanity or sympathy, he tells them they can stay for awhile.  The young man is an immigrant from Syria, a musician who plays the Djembe, an African drum somewhat akin to a bongo.  The young lady, his girlfriend, is an immigrant from Syria.  They are a poor but very committed couple.

Jenkins finds himself drawn to the Djembe, and when the young Syrian catches Jenkins in the act of beating on it, his face brightens and he eagerly takes on his new pupil.  Jenkins takes to the drum with a type of joy you have to see to believe.  Here's an older professor, as uptight as can be, enveloped by years of sadness and boredom.  It's not like he suddenly bursts into manic life.  His awakening is gentle and slow...yet no less profound for its quietness.  The two men forge a friendship of sorts, and actually begin playing some in public in the park.  Coming home from this ""concert"", the young man accidentally snags his Djembe on the subway turnstile, and leads the subway cops to think he has jumped the turnstile.  He is arrested, and it is then that we discover (as we might have guessed anyway) that he is NOT in the country legally.

At this point, the film is trying very hard to make itself about the American immigration system.  And not surprisingly, it is advocating for a more open system.  I'll try to keep my politics out of the review...because for me, these issues continued to be secondary to watching the relationships between Jenkins and his new friends.  Eventually, the mother of the detainee comes to town, and she and Jenkins forge a very convincing relationship...which I will say no more about.  In fact, that's it for revealing the plot, because it does take a few turns.

The movie is full of heartbreak, but it is even more full of redemption.  The power of the music is made almost palpable.  We see Jenkins tapping his feet or keeping a beat with his fingers without even knowing it.  He is transformed, yes, by his new friendships...but also by the discovery that he can actually make music.

Writer McCarthy has created an ""ordinary"" guy and fashioned for him a unique and unforgettable personal journey.  Yes, the plight of the ""illegal"" immigrant is illustrated (at least it doesn't get TOO preachy)...but trust me, the growth of these characters and relationships is what you will remember about this powerful little film.  While I've dwelt on Jenkins so much, let me just say that EVERYONE in the film is excellent.  What a great group of people to spend 104 minutes with!

While overall it may not be the best film of the year (although it might be)...the performance from Richard Jenkins may be one of the two or three best I've seen by a leading man this year (add Brendan Gleeson from IN BRUGES and just for fun, Robert Downey Jr. for IRON MAN).  No matter where you fall on the immigration issue, don't deny yourself the chance to see this wonderful performance.",1225065600,,4544,4.637046307884856
2428573,5,B000BN6M12,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I won't go into plot details, others in the review list have done that.

If you let this movie into your heart, as main character Walter allows his foreign visitors into his, you will be moved.

When watching this film, given the upcoming election in the USA, I couldn't help but think of the alarming polarization of our country, the messages of hate, divisiveness and exclusion which are being tossed around so blatantly, and the unbelievable but true fact that significant numbers of Americans, both young and old, would vote based solely on.......the color of a person's skin! An entire political campaign has been run on the idea of fear and racism, by people who claim to be followers of Jesus Christ. Does anyone else see the craziness of this?? Will we ever grow up?

Pardon the mini-rant! I doubt filmmaker McCarthy was even thinking of this when he penned the screenplay. But that lesson is inherent in the film. We need to be color blind; we need to reach out to our fellow travelers with kindness and charity. We need to accept people for who they are--human beings, just like us--and quit fearing, categorizing and judging them. That's what Walter does, and his life is wonderfully enriched because of it.

The scene in the park with all the drummers is so uplifting, it brought tears to my eyes. Walter is hesitant to sit in; he feels horribly self-conscious and uncomfortably out of place. He's wearing a sportcoat and tie, he's bald, he's a middle-aged white guy. He hangs back, despite Tarik's words of encouragement, and after what seems like an eternity...he finally says to himself, what the hell....and takes the plunge. And has a blast. This wonderfully affirmative scene epitomizes the movie.

The Visitor is a very small, understated film; it's the kind of movie that, when you look for it in the video store, you will probably find only one copy. That is a shame, because this could be such a powerful healer of the wounds of division, ignorance and hatred in this country.

It's a visual lesson in how to live with and love one another, and it's delivered at a crucial time in our history. I would hope that many, many people would see it.",1225065600,,2214,4.664102564102564

When he arrives at his NY apartment, he discovers a young couple in residence there.  The husband had sublet the apartment from someone - whom the professor (Dr. Walter Vale) does not even know.  As the couple, Tarek and Zainub, gather up their possessions and begin to leave,
Dr. Vale takes pity on them and allows them to remain.

In the weeks that follow, a bond develops - Walter and Tarek begin playing drums together - and their lives fall into an amiable pattern.

And then calamity strikes.  Tarek is arrested in the subway station - for something he did not do - and is taken to a detention center to await deportation hearings.  Walter finds himself entrenched in the process.  He hires an immigration lawyer and attempts to ameliorate the situation.

As events unfold - with Tarek's mother Moona arriving from Michigan - Walter finds his life changing radically.

Now I was hooked, sitting on the edge of my seat and hoping for a positive outcome for these characters that had forged their way into my heart.

Richard Jenkins (from Six Feet Under) performs admirably as the professor, with Haaz Sleiman and Danai Gurira as Tarek and Zainub, also bringing in heart-rending performances.",1224633600,2,1492,5.443478260869565

""The Visitor"" deals with human relationships and discusses post-9/11 America's social and political issues, specifically, the plight of immigrants.

2428586,4,B000BN6M12,"""The Visitor"" is the second film in which writer/director Tom McCarthy presents an emotionally perceptive story of relationships that develop between people who meet by chance. Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) is a widowed economics professor who takes no interest in anything at this stage of his life. When he reluctantly travels to New York to present a paper at a conference, he is surprised to find a young couple living in the Manhattan apartment that he seldom uses. Tarek Khalil (Haaz Sleiman), a musician from Syria, and his Senegalese girlfriend Zainab (Danai Gurira) have illegally sublet the apartment. They are apologetic and eager to avoid trouble, but Walter invites them to stay until they find another place. Walter finds himself irresistibly drawn to Tarek's African drum and deeply concerned about the couple's plight when their immigration status is discovered.

There is a political statement here about the inflexibility of immigrations law, especially for Muslims, since the events of 9/11. But the story is Walter's re-engagement in life. It's a pleasure to watch him find some reason to do something after years of apathy. Tarek's drums, his incarceration, and finally Tarek's elegant and worried mother Mouna (Hiam Abbass) bring Walter to life, with the help of a restrained performance by Richard Jenkins. Hiam Abbass has fantastic presence and evokes great sympathy as a self-contained woman who blames herself for her son's problems. I would recommend the film for her appeal alone. But Mouna and Walter are both interesting characters, isolated in their own way, from different subcultures, who have collided with unexpected results. ""The Visitor"" is a character study with strong elements of both optimism and pessimism.

The DVD (Anchor Bay 2008): Both widescreen and full screen versions are on the same disc.

2428587,4,B000BN6M12,"I thoroughly enjoyed this ""sleeper"".  It never had a wide viewing at the movie chains across the country, but that's the moviegoer's loss. There's a lot here for those who enjoy character-driven stories.

The deliberate pace of the first half of the movie might try the patience of some, but those with persistence will be rewarded with a dramatic ""awakening"" and renewal of the Vale character in the last part of the story. Richard Jenkins gives the breakout performance of his solid, but unheralded, acting career, in his role as a recently widowed college professor whose career and life are ""in limbo"", so to speak.

The acting by all 4 of the principals is superb, especially the performance of Hiam Abbass as the mother of the imprisoned Syrian drummer (Hazz Sleiman) who introduces Prof. Vale (Richard Jenkins) into the world of a Manhattan improvizational drumming group and awakens him to a part of himself that seems to have died when his wife did.

If you are a native you will definitely see under a different light all the foreigners surrounding you and sometimes annoy you or they do not make sense to you.  If you are an immigrant you will feel so much compassion for Tarek. Now if you happen to be illegal in this country (or as a matter of fact in any country) you will get a knot in your stomach.

Another interesting aspect of the movie is the culture differences between Tarek who is a man from the Middle East (Syria) and his girlfriend who is from West Africa (Senegal). And finally you see Walter a New Yorker who is an observer of this relationship. At times he feels awkward or sometimes he makes hilarious comments. It is also great to see how two different persons can come so close to each other. In the case of Tarek and Walter it is music that brings them so close.

All the characters in the movie are every day people and will find it very easy to relate with them. I think this is the reason why this movie is so charming. I highly recommend it. See it with an open mind and heart.",1223683200,,1176,4.283783783783784
2428593,4,B000BN6M12,"The first thing that struck me while watching `The Visitor' is how much the protagonist reminded me of Dennis Quaid's character in `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smart-People/dp/B0019XZDZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smart People</a>'.  Although this movie was made before that one, we have a man who has a striking resemblance.  Walter (Richard Jenkins) is a professor at a Connecticut college.  He is a widower who is taking piano lessons, so that he can learn the same talent his wife was able to create for her C.D.'s.  With his students he's tight-fisted, not giving anyone slack, while he lives his solitary life almost in a catatonic state at home.

His life is quickly disheveled when he goes to his New York rental and runs into a foreign couple living in his flat.  Startled to be sure, he learns quickly that Tarek (Haaz Speiman) and Mouna (Hiam Abbass) have been renting his place from Ivan, a mysterious opportunist we never meet.  Tarek is a percussion musician who often plays on street corners or at jazz venues in bars.  Perhaps given the jolt he needs, Walter warmly welcomes them to stay in his place while Tarek gives him bongo lessons and invitations to his concerts.  Eventually, a mutual warmth thaws Walter's life.

In a mishap, Tarek uses his subway pass to get past the turnstile, but makes the mistake of letting a ticket-less Walter through, too.  From here the police descend on Tarek and incarcerate him as an illegal alien.  For the rest of the film, Walter makes Tarek's freedom and citizenship the first priority while allowing his professional opportunities to slip past.

Tom McCarthy (who directed the wonderful indie film, `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Station-Agent/dp/B0001WTWDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Station Agent</a>') wrote and directed this film, and it is to his credit that the movie has a similar quirkiness to evoke a unique warmth.  While the acting is real-life believable, the dialogue sometimes consists of small talk or lacks spark.  Certainly, there are laudable themes here, but the movie works best when it lets the action do the talking.  Although this is a good indie film, it lacks the impact of other fine immigrant movies where comparisons of recent movies like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Namesake/dp/B000U2U0E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Namesake</a>' and '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-Push-Cart/dp/B000TSJ01I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man Push Cart</a>' quickly come to mind.

2428594,5,B000BN6M12,"This is easily one of the best films of this year.  Tom McCarthy's previous film ""The Station Agent"" was equally good and followed the similar theme of friendship.  This film again reminded me of what my father tells me that you can't pick your family (Mom, Dad, siblings, ...) or your boss.  Well, that leaves just one thing that we can choose.  It is our friends which sometimes happens in our everyday routine or extreme situations like this one.  Friendship is such a dynamic relationship that always changes.  It begins and ends as well as changes in between.

In this film, we see a lonely man, Walter, who shapes his life around a friendship with a young man, Tarek.  The most unlikely friendship between a old guy set in his ways and a young guy who is willing to share his love of drums.  They meet together in the most unpleasant situation from a landlord who signs 2 leases to the same apartment.  What happens is part of the pleasure which I won't give away.  Other friendships between Walter and Tarek's girlfriend and mother resonates strongly.

Alot of this film reminds me of my life where people touch me in different ways.  Often times, we remember the good in those friends and it's sad to see them go.  But, there is one thing that we take away from it.  We pass along those small treasures from one to another and don't forget.  In this case, Walt found a love for the drums and it will remind him of his friend, Tarek.  I saw alot of Tarek in my friends who dig me out of my shell.  It made me discover some interests and talents in myself.

This film has a few extras like ""Behind the Scenes"" and ""Playing the Djembe"" which are interesting.  I recently went to a film discussion on ""The Visitor"" which over-analyzed this film.  So, I encourage just to see the extras and decide for yourself.  To me, I just take this film at face-value on everday lives between strangers who build friendships.  If you liked this film, I would strongly recommend ""The Station Agent"" which may be a bit slower paced given the storyline.  However, you soon grow to enjoy how a drawf and coffee stand guy become friends as well as others like a librarian and artist build strong bonds.",1223683200,,2188,4.481012658227848
2428605,3,B000BN6M12,"Spoilers ahead:

This story is interesting enough, with a bored professor latching on to a young foreign couple from Senegal and Syria, respectively, who have taken to living in his old apartment.  He tries his best to help them when one is detained for no good reason except that his mother threw out a notice about deportation that had been sent to them years earlier, and he never saw it.  Also, the couple is in the US illegally.
It is all very predictable, with one person being sent back home and the prof trying to make the detention center officers feel guilty--to no avail-and then he takes up drumming in the subway as a tribute to his missing pal.
Also, there are several shots of the Statue of Liberty, the flag, and so on, which are clearly meant to get in our faces about injustice in the face of a free country.  We didn't really need these, though; any injustices should already be obvious.",1223683200,5,906,4.5060975609756095
2428606,5,B000BN6M12,"""The Visitor"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In a world of six billion people, it only takes one to change your life. Sixty-two-year-old Walter Vale is sleepwalking through his life. Having lost his passion for teaching and writing, he fills the void by unsuccessfully trying to learn to play classical piano. When his college sends him to Manhattan to attend a conference, Walter is surprised to find a young couple has taken up residence in his apartment. Victims of a real estate scam, Tarek, a Syrian man, and Zainab, his Senegalese girlfriend, have nowhere else to go. In the first of a series of tests of the heart, Walter reluctantly allows the couple to stay with him. Touched by his kindness, Tarek, a talented musician, insists on teaching the aging academic to play the African drum. The instrument's exuberant rhythms revitalize Walter's faltering spirit and open his eyes to a vibrant world of local jazz clubs and Central Park drum circles. As the friendship between the two men deepens, the differences in culture, age and temperament fall away. After being stopped by police in the subway, Tarek is arrested as an undocumented citizen and held for deportation. As his situation turns desperate, Walter finds himself compelled to help his new friend with a passion he thought he had long ago lost. When Tarek's beautiful mother Mouna arrives unexpectedly in search of her son, the professor's personal commitment develops into an unlikely romance. And it's through these new found connections with these virtual strangers that Walter is awakened to a new world and a new life.

The cast led by Richard Jenkins (in an Oscar-worthy performance as Walter Vale) is brilliant! The story and screenplay and directing by Tom McCarthy (who also wrote and directed ""The Station Agent"" (2003) and is also an actor, whose roles include ""Flags Of Our Fathers"" (2006), ""Syriana"" (2005), ""Good Night, And Good Luck. (2005) & ""Meet The Parents"" (2000) is brilliant!

The music by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek (who won the Oscar for his work on ""Finding Neverland"" (2004) is excellent! The cinematography by Oliver Bokelberg (who also did the cinematography to ""The Station Agent"") is excellent! The film editing by Tom McArdle (who also did the film editing to ""The Station Agent"") is excellent! The casting by Kerry Barden, Billy Hopkins, Paul Schnee, Suzanne Smith (all four did the casting to ""The Station Agent"" & ""Funny Games"" (2008), & Stphane Foenkinos is excellent!  The production design by John Paino (who also did the production design to ""The Station Agent"") is excellent! The art direction by Len Clayton (who also did the art direction to ""The Station Agent"") is excellent! The set decoration by Kim Chapman is excellent! The costume design by Melissa Toth (who also did the costume design to ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" (2004) & ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008) is excellent!

This is an brilliant, heartwarming drama that stays will you even after its done. This is one of the best films of the year. This is definitely a front-runner at the Oscars for next year, especially Jenkins' performance.",1223596800,,3122,4.998076923076923
2428607,5,B000BN6M12,"If Richard Jenkins doesn't get an Oscar nod for his amazing performance in Thomas McCarthy's new comedy-drama, The Visitor, I will personally picket the Academy. Writer-director-actor McCarthy's previous effort was the critical favorite The Station Agent, and once again he draws us into an extended family of very believable, warm-blooded characters, generously giving all of his actors plenty of room to breathe.

Jenkins absolutely inhabits the character of the life-tired, middle-aged widower Walter Vale. He is a Connecticut college professor leading a life of quiet desperation; he sleepwalks through his dreary workday, and it's obvious that any inspirational spark is long gone from an unwavering lesson plan that is more aged than his students. His personal life has become rote as well; most of his leisure time is spent puttering, and half-heartedly plunking away on his late wife's piano. In the film's wonderfully played opening scene, Walter fires his private piano teacher, who turns out to be the fourth in a row that he has dismissed. As a parting shot, she suggests that if he should decide that mastering the keyboard is just not his forte, especially ""at his age"", she would be most interested in buying his ""wife's"" piano (ouch). Clearly, Walter needs to get out more.

When Walter travels to New York to attend a conference and present a paper, he has a big surprise awaiting him at the seldom-used apartment he keeps in the city. Unbeknownst to the professor, a mysterious third party has sublet his digs to an immigrant couple-a Syrian musician named Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and his Senegalese girlfriend, Zainab (Danai Gurira). After some tense moments between the mutually startled parties, the forlorn Walter invites them to stay rather than turning them out on the street. As a friendship slowly grows between the three, Walter begins to emerge from his cocoon, prompted by Tarek's infectious enthusiasm for pounding out joyful rhythms on his African djembes. Before he knows it, the staid professor is loosening his tie and joining Tarek in a drum circle at a public park. When Tarek is arrested by undercover cops in the subway due to a misunderstanding and ends up at a detention center for illegal immigrants, Walter hires a lawyer and becomes even more ensconced in the couple's lives. Add one more unexpected ""visitor"" to the mix-Tarek's widowed mother Mouna (the lovely and stately Israeli actress Hiam Abbass) who has traveled from Detroit to investigate why her son hasn't contacted her for an alarming period of time. Now, all the elements of a ""perfect storm"" are in place for the reawakening of Walter Vale.

Thanks to Jenkins' subtle, quietly compelling performance, that transformation is the heart of the film, and an absolute joy to behold. Although he has over 70 films to his credit (mostly supporting roles, but always memorable), he is probably most recognizable for his portrayal of the ""late"" father in HBO's popular series, Six Feet Under. Hiam Abbass is a revelation here as well; she and Jenkins play off each other in sublime fashion in all of their scenes together.  In fact, no one in the cast hits a false note, ever. This is undoubtedly due in large part to the fact that McCarthy is an ""actor's director"" in the literal sense; he remains active in tackling roles himself (most recently appearing in  HBO's final season of The Wire as a newspaper journalist who manufactures his stories).

The ""strange bedfellows"" setup of the plot may look like The Goodbye Girl or The Odd Couple on paper, but this not a glib Neil Simon play, where characters throw perfectly timed zingers at each other; these people feel, and interact, like real human beings. There is plenty of humor, but there is also genuine heartbreak and bittersweet melancholy. The important thing is that it is all perfectly balanced, and beautifully nuanced.

Although the circumstances leading up to Tarek's unfortunate detention could be viewed as an allusion to the sometimes Kafkaesque scenarios faced by illegal immigrants in a post 9-11 world, McCarthy doesn't get preachy on this particular issue or use his film as a polemic.

One thing I will say-if the overwrought and vastly overrated Crash (2005) could win Best Picture, then surely The Visitor, which deals with many of the same themes, and in a less histrionic and more palatable manner, deserves consideration as well (we shall see). In the meantime, you don't want to miss this lovely little gem.",1223251200,,4480,5.028301886792453
2428608,5,B000BN6M12,"Ever so often an independent film materializes amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywoods zillion dollar budgets that reminds us just how thought provoking and touching films can be. With characters well written and fleshed out, as well as  realistic scenarious that force us to question how we'd react if placed in similar circumstances, the Visitor is a tour de force of American independent filmaking. Director Tod mcCarthy takes a hot button subject , and puts faces to those thousands of individuals living here illegaly, some of who just happen to be good people trying to enjoy the American Dream like everyone else. I'm usually pretty stoic when it comes to tearjerker movies, but it is without shame that i admit I cried like a baby during one particular scene( the airport farwell). The transformation of the lead character from an emotionally detached pedagogue to a comforter/ righteously indignant champion of Tariq's plight was also deeply moving..

Overall i'd have to say that in the zenophobic, post 911 society we live in today, it's refreshing to see movies like ""The Visitor"" eschew media stereotypes and prejudices and show us the  ""real people"" and back stories of individuals who live in this country illegally.",1222041600,,1234,5.068965517241379
2428609,4,B000BN6M12,"This is an exquisitely done movie. The story grabs you and pulls you into the lives of its main characters so well that you almost wish you knew them in real life.

I loved this movie. But it bothered me that I.C.E. was shown as a villain because it is not. Immigration laws are in place in the US for an important reason, just like in every other country. Even Mexico has zero tolerance for illegal immigrants, but they encourage their own to come here and break our laws as illegal immigrants.

The perspective of this movie is one you don't get to see very often unless you have been through the experience of being an illegal immigrant. I really appreciated being able to better understand that situation, but I still support our country's laws. Without our laws, we would not be America.",1221955200,,792,4.531468531468532
2428610,5,B000BN6M12,"What a marvellous revelation of a film!  This film has so much to offer.  It is at times captivating, at other times sad, but always compelling.  This film should be seen by a wider audience than the art house market.

If ""The Visitor"" does nothing else, it raises to the light the issue of illegal immigration.  In this post 11 September world, the fate of illegal immigrants is much more tenuous.  Indeed, this applies not just in America but the entire western world where newly arrived foreigners are viewed with suspicion.  The fact that immigrants add value and pay taxes is too easily forgotten as we revert to positions of hostile disengagement.

""The Visitor"" centres around a detached and bored economics professor from Connecticut who visits Manhattan where he owns an apartment.  Upon arrival, he discovers that the apartment is occupied by a young couple.  The man is from Syria and the woman is from Senegal.  They are initially hostile to one another but within a short time come to trust one another.  Unfortunately, the young man (Tarek) is detained by immigration authorities.  His mother arrives to help him and, as this process takes place, a warmth develops between the professor and the mother.  This is a film where characters develop slowly but their true emotions shine.

The plot to ""The Visitor"" is slim.  Rather, it is a character study of very plausible people.  All the main characters are warm and giving people.  If there is a dark side to the film it is in the characters of the various government bureaucrats.  These people are portrayed as clinical and uncaring.  In a subtle way, the film is a critique of modern fears of different people.  Its ending is sad.  It is,nonetheless a terrific film.  Go see it!",1221350400,,1743,4.794612794612795

  Where the movie hits home is directly in the heart. And so laughter and tears permeate throughout. It is not one story, but many brought together, wonderfully intertwined and connected life experiences that most will strongly relate to. While raising hope, the movie provides no easy answers. It certainly does not provide the typical Hollywood ending. Is the ending happy or unhappy? Different viewers will provide different answers.
  Definitely one of my all-time favourite movies.",1219881600,2,596,5.051020408163265

The initial catalyst is a young couple, immigrants who are proud, intelligent and illegal. The emotional bonds that develop between the characters are, in and of themselves, warm and rewarding. Conversely, the realities of a post 9/11 world complicate not only the immigrant's lives, but the viewer's emotional investment as well.  The characters are attractive and appealing as they seek better lives for themselves. They're also law breakers with few skills or assets to offer a modern America.

2428614,5,B000BN6M12,"Just when it seems that film makers have sold out to the idea of blockbuster instant wealth, along comes the very quiet little film THE VISITOR, reassuring us that quality independent films are alive and well.  Written and directed by actor Thomas McCarthy, whose only previous film in the role of writer/director was the incomparable THE STATION AGENT, this subdued little miracle of a film further examines the concept of isolated man searching for connection.  The impact of this simple story of friendship and bonding stays with the viewer, permanently imprinted on our view of the global community.

Professor Walter Vale (Richard Jennings in a career making role) is an older man, widowed and greatly diminished by the death of his opera singer wife, bored with teaching the same class on Economics at Connecticut College for years while writing yet another book that holds no interest for him - a lonely, embittered man longing for some meaning in his life, trying to learn piano from an older teacher Barbara (Marion Seldes) without much success.  His college sends him to New York to 'read' a paper he supposedly 'co-wrote' with a colleague and he reluctantly goes to the city for the 'task': he owns an apartment there that he uses only occasionally. Upon arrival he finds a young, terrified couple living in his apartment - two illegal immigrants, Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) from Syria and his girlfriend  Zainab (Danai Jekesai Gurira) from Senegal.  At first shocked by the couple, Walter soon feels their insecurities and invites them to stay.  Tarek has been in America for three years, living in  Michigan with his mother Mouna (Hiam Abbass), and has only been in New York a short while, following his dream to play drums and to be with his jewelry-making lover Zainab.

Over time Walter begins to absorb the joy of living Tarek displays while he is drumming and Tarek teaches Walter the art of the drum. Together they perform in parks while Zainab sells her jewelry in the streets.  A minor incident in the subway results in Tarek's arrest and because his is an illegal immigrant, he is placed in a Detention Center in Queens.  Walter is shocked at the cruelty of the police action, remains supportive to the devastated Zainab, and visits the distraught Tarek daily in the Detention Center, finding a lawyer to help the case and in every way being supportive of his new friend.

Mouna arrives form Michigan to see why her son has stopped calling her and Walter and Mouna become close out of mutual concern and love for Tarek and his depressing situation.  Though they try to recover Tarek from detention, the 'methods and rules' of the government are against their efforts. The film ends with a sigh, not trying to resolve the insoluble problems of immigrant detention in this country, but instead focusing on the impact these four very beautiful people have made on each other.

McCarthy's concept and writing and direction are understated and all the more strong in the final impact of the film because of that approach.  Each of the four main characters is outstanding: Jennings gives an Oscar worthy performance, the new face of Haaz Sleiman is a revelation, and the beautifully nuanced acting of Abbass and Gurira suggest strong careers in the making. The musical score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek  greatly enhances the film. This is a magically tender and beautifully sensitive film and deserves the attention of all who care about the global village and about the importance of independent filmmaking.
