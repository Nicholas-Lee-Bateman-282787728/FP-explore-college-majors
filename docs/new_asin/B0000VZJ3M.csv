So it is not a documentary or educational, if that is what you are looking for, you may want to pass on this item.  However, if you want to see some of the beautiful sights that Santiago Cuba has to offer, this is a great video for you.

My husband and his family left Santiago de Cuba in the late 1960s and they were thrilled with this DVD.  It gave the the opportunity to see places they longed to be, but sadly can no longer return to.  One elderly member of our family watched it so much, we bought a second copy for fear that he would end up wearing it out!",1247011200,,626,4.024193548387097
