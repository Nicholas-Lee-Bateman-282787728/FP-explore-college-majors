2769458,5,B000NJISJ8,"My husband and I have always loved the Cosby Show.  It's good clean humor, which is hard to find these days.  When seasons 1 and 2 came out on DVD I purchased them immediately.  My 5 year old son watches them EVERY DAY!!  He will watch the Cosby Show instead of watching cartoons or anything else.  We have watched this so much he can recite entire episodes.  I can't complain because at least he not repeating the junk that has infiltrated our TVs or radios today.  It is a beautiful thing to be able to share this with my child.  I encourage everyone to do the same.  I can't wait until seasons 3 and 4 come out.",1175817600,6,614,4.17948717948718

2769460,5,B000NJISJ8,"Fans of NBC's The Cosby Show will be able to double their viewing pleasure since this item will be released along with the Season 3 set on June 5. For this season,it's goodbye Lisa Bonet and hello Geoffrey Owens. In this season which premiered on September 24,1987,Owens,who made several recurring guest appearances during seasons 2 and 3,is inaugurated as a regular into the cast. Elvin Tibidaux(Owens) and Sondra Huxtable(Sabrina LeBeauf) are now husband and wife and in the season premiere,they return to Brooklyn from their honeymoon only to meet Sondra's disappointed parents when they learn that she and Elvin dropped out of Princeton University and decided to discontinue studying medicine. Clair(Phylicia Rashad) demanded every cent of the tuition money back($8,000 estimate)! Cliff(Bill Cosby) even bought a stethescope as a welcome home gift for Elvin. In the opening montage,the cast,including Owens and minus Bonet,are elegantly dressed and are dancing again,this time to a new theme with vocals by Bobby McFerrin*. Cosby is seen holding a black-and-white photo of ""dead"" Bonet. Malcolm Jamal Warner,who was quite rhythmic in the season 2 and 3 opening montages,only shuffles one of his feet after looking at his wrist watch. Owens comes along and kisses LeBeauf's hand. Tempest Bledsoe at first appears aggravated but proceeds to gradually shuffle her body. Keshia Knight Pulliam is brought to the camera lens by Cosby,then she flashes her toothy grin. Here's what else we'll see this season:Elvin's and Sondra's new apartment,despite a few flaws,Rudy(KKP) studying the violin without choice,Clair finding magazines filled with half-naked women in them in Theo's(MJW) possession and Theo,ready to attend his high school senior prom but doesn't(along with a few buddies,one of them being portrayed by Adam Sandler). Bonet moved on to continue playing her character Denise on the spinoff A DIFFERENT WORLD which premiered along with this season. But she recurred the character during this season and the next. *Bobby McFerrin rose to fame with his #1 self-penned hit DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY in 1988. He also was heard in the season 1(1987) theme for Fox's DUET.",1172620800,2,2169,5.345029239766082
2769471,3,B000NJISJ8,"I love The Cosby Show but was VERY disappointed with the quality of this dvd release.

From the cheap packaging (three slim cases holding the dvds), to the lack of an option to play all episodes continously, to the poor rendering of the episodes.. seasons 1 and 2 (recorded YEARS before these seasons) look tens times better in their individual dvd releases.

2769506,5,B000NJISJ8,"My husband and I were newly married back in 1984 when this series first aired. Thursday nights were definitely the ""must see"" TV people talk about primarily due to this show. We rarely missed an episode and when we weren't going to be home, we recorded it on our VCR (remember those?).

Fast forward many years and with a daughter added to our family, we bought these in 2007 and watched the first three seasons again. Just a few weeks ago, we pulled out season 1 and laughed our way through it and then contintinued on through seasons 2 and 3. Just last night, we finished Season 4 and what a joy it was to know there are still more seasons to go. My daughter is 17, my husband 55, and I am 50 -- a wide range of ages and yet all of us are laughing from beginning to end and appreciating what a comic genius Bill Cosby is. The cast is incredible, the characters full of quirks and personality, the writing is stupendous.

If you haven't seen these before and are looking for good, clean fun give them a try. If you saw these years ago, give them another go since this is definitely a series that has stood the test of time.",1339200000,,1124,4.223255813953489

2769509,3,B000NJISJ8,"We love the Cosby show - it was so nice when shows were innocent and promoted positive family values and interactions!

Just be sure you check the discs right away.  We purchased the set and didn't get to watching them for a while, and discovered that one of the discs was defective - it didn't appear that the layers adhered correctly.  Check under good light at different angles for what looks like a wavy line where about half the disc is a different shade than the rest.

Amazon took the first set back after 30 days (very nice of them) but the replacement set had the same problem with disc 2 instead of disc 1 and we didn't see it upon first inspection.",1282003200,,659,4.333333333333333
2769510,4,B000NJISJ8,"Season four's box set is identical to season three's, with the same unfortunate disappointments. Each disc is place in its separate slim case, and yet again no bonus material. But of course the main reason to buy this set is for the episodes and it is nice to have season four out on DVD. You can definitely tell the Huxtable kids are growing up, so the episode plots started to change gradually. There were a few big changes to the show in season four. Elvin and Sondra are married, but unfortunately Lisa Bonet (Denise) is not in season four because she was working on another show called ""A Different World"" which follows her experiences at Hillman College. But other than that, this season is fantastic and it was a great excitement when I first received it. I really enjoyed the episode ""Once Upon a Time"", it was a unique episode to the series because it pretty much takes place in Rudy's fantasy. But there are many great episodes from season four since there are no episode descriptions available for season four, I'll list them below.

Call of the Wild - Airdate: 9/24/1987 - The newlywed Sondra and Elvin return from their honeymoon with shocking news for Cliff and Clair; they want to abandon their dreams of being a lawyer and doctor and open a wilderness store.

That's Not What I Said - Airdate: 10/29/1987 - Cliff and Clair have an argument after Theo gets detained by police for riding in a car with an unlicensed driver.

Autumn Gifts - Airdate: 11/5/1987 - Rudy goes to an older widowed lady's house each afternoon to have tea and play cards, but notices that she refuses to take her daily medication for diabetes. She tells Cliff, who devises a plan to try to convince her that she needs to take her medication.

Looking Back (Part One) - Airdate: 11/12/1987 - Sondra and Elvin have their first marital fight, and Elvin comes to the Huxtable house for comfort and support. Clair shares about the difficulties in their house as flashbacks are shown.

Dance Mania - Airdate: 12/3/1987 - Theo and Cockroach have tickets to appear on television on the dance show ""Dance Mania"", but are told that only one of them can enter the studio during the filming because of fire laws. Theo miscalculates by offering to let Cockroach go in (thinking he'll refuse) and gets angry when Cockroach takes him up on the offer.

The Locker Room - Airdate: 12/10/1987 - Theo and his classmates brag about their dates with girls in the locker room, but Theo's mood changes when one of the guys goes out with Vanessa and brags about it the next day.

The Show Must Go On - Airdate: 12/17/1987 - Vaudeville is shown to Rudy and her friends, who are unimpressed.

Bookworm - Airdate: 1/7/1988 - Clair drags Cliff to her book club meeting, but he's the lone male there. Much to Clair's surprise, Cliff knows quite a bit about the book in question! Meanwhile, the kids attempt a sleepover at Sondra and Elvin's run-down studio apartment, but are overwhelmed by the noise and lack of utilities.

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star - Airdate: 1/14/1988 - Rudy has to play the violin in music class at school, but gets jealous because she thinks her classmates' instruments are more fun.

The Visit - Airdate: 1/21/1988 - Theo visits a friend in the hospital who has cancer.

The Drum Major - Airdate: 2/4/1988 - Vanessa tries out for the drum major at school.

Gone Fishin' - Airdate: 4/29/1988 - When the Huxtable men go fishing, Theo catches the dead body of a gangster that the police have been chasing, and soon attracts attention from the news media. This success goes to his head, while Rudy and Kenny find a nest of baby birds, but the mother bird is missing. The two stories eventually cross in a surprising-and rather humiliating-lesson for Theo.

Season four's DVD release is similar to season three's and has the same disappointments but it's still highly recommended.",1280534400,6,5270,4.665226781857451
2769511,4,B000NJISJ8,"""Still Number#1"" as Bill Cosby was so proud of noting during this time period this was the first season where their were serious changes in the works for the Huxtables. One of the most important things to note that's easy to notice actually is that during this time,all of the kids in this family were growing up. Lisa Bonet is out of the cast and maybe no one noticed but that rather smug picture frame ""gag"" during this seasons theme song kind of gives the impression that she won't be entirely missed by at least one cast member. Either way Denise not being present to a huge extent during this season changed some of the dynamics. First off we start off with the fact that the the newly married Sondra and Elvin (Geoffrey Owens officially joined the cast this season) surprise the Huxtable parents when they decide to blow off graduate school to open up a wilderness store. This seperates Sondra from her usual characterization of being the ""most like her parents"" on the education front and builds on some of her earlier advocasy of Denise ""taking some time to live life"" after high school. An ongoing plot point this season finds the couple involved in living in a slummy apartment and that provides some mildly funny moments. But overall this sets the tone for season. There are a lot of episodes in this season that look to take on serious issues. The relationship between Theo and Cockroach in downplayed as Theo himself is now in a basically adult body but as another reviewer pointed out ""not quite funny as a man"" yet. That is until Cockroach appruptly disappears,all over a haircut disagreement with Cosby so the story goes and Theo is left with a new group of friends one of whom is played by a young Adam Sandler as Smitty. This is all after the great episode ""Dance Mania"" as Theo and Cockroach become temporary rivals over an appearance on a Soul Train-like TV show. The character of Theo also faces an issue of one of cancer with another of his friends later on in the season. Rudy's growing pains are even more obvious. In one episode she weeps to ""It's Not Easy Being Green"",lamenting her awkward transitional stage to cute kid to preteen and there were signs the transition wasn't easy for her. She's lost in a mall too and then is reciting a story about her perceptions of war in the funny and also touching episode ""Once Upon A Time"". This makes for a season that doesn't always have the warm heartedness and laughs of earlier reasons but is more about a group of young people confronting the joys and pains of time and aging.",1269388800,2,2549,4.567685589519651
2769512,5,B000NJISJ8,"Even though the Cosby Show is around 20 years old, it's still one of the best sit-coms ever. Bill Cosby is hilarious - a comic genius. His reactions to events are so spontaneous and creative. I haven't seen another comic quite like him. Best of all, the show's plots are both family-friendly and funny. Unlike modern sit-coms, the characters don't curse and talk about sex every other scene. Rather the episodes are centered around family dramas that are realistic but always resolved well. The cast includes everybody from Phylicia Rashad as the tough and very intelligent Mrs. Huxtable, to the young and adorable Rudy. This makes the show accessible to a wide range of audiences. I am glad these finally came out on DVD. I hope one day to share this treasure with my children.",1263168000,,778,4.770370370370371

2769517,5,B000NJISJ8,"In retrospect, this is one of the more interesting seasons.  When the show begins, we notice one person missing from the original cast, Lisa Bonet.  (She only appears in picture form during the title sequence.)  Where has she gone?  Off to the west coast set of A Different World for the popular spin-off's first season.  Dear Lisa would only appear as a guest star on two new episodes, ""Shakespere"" and ""Home for the Weekend.""  (That doesn't include the fantastic slection of previous footage illuded to in the 2-part ""Looking Back"" collage.)

Instead of seeing Lisa, we witness the introduction of Geoffrey Owens to the regular cast, portraying Elvin Tibbadeaux, who is now married to the oldest Huxtable child, Sondra.  They've decided not to pursue their previous career interests and devote themselves to running their own wilderness supply store.  This venture presents a recurring topic throughout this season, as well as the first season of A Different World.

Meanwhile, the Huxtable ship keeps sailing with Theo completing his turbulent high school career, Vanessa's boyfriend list expanding, Rudy wanting to wear the wrong clothes and Cliff losing his memory.  Among the celebrity guest stars are Christopher Plummer, Adam Sandler (as a recurring character) and Wallice Shaun (also recurring).  [Of course, we also have Adam saying, ""When Roxanne finds out there's no helicoptor, she is gonna - "" what's the word "" - plotz!""",1215648000,7,1435,5.1645021645021645
2769518,5,B000NJISJ8,"I'd like to thank the producers of this DVD. I grew up with the Cosby show and it's very nice to see all the episodes again on DVD.
Even years later it's still one of the best comedy shows out there.

I just wish there were some bonus material and I'm still waiting for a re-release of the first season on DVD which was cut on the first release.",1190160000,,345,4.0
2769519,2,B000NJISJ8,"Season 4 is where the Cosby Show ""jumps the shark"" and loses its focus.  A show where the dad was determined to maintain his authority (along with his wife) in order to teach the kids turns into a bad version of The Brady Bunch.

The character of Rudy, so cute in Season 1, and a little cute in Season 2, is more annoying (in a bratty, precocious sort of way) than anything else in Season 4.  Denise is gone (spun off to Different World, but also out of the cast because actress Lisa Bonet had lost favor with Cosby himself, and rightly so); Theo has finally grown out of his cracked voice funniness and is not yet funny as a man; the underused and underappreciated subtlety of Vanessa has been replaced by a misguided attempt at glamorizing her character; and extremely funny Elvin with the passable Sondra are consistently underused.

One example says it all for me:  In ""Home for the Weekend,"" Denise basically stiffs her family to hang out and party all night long with friends.  Instead of the parents pulling rank as they always do and teaching Denise that she still owes her family loyalty and time, they do a sitcom prank of ignoring her, then avoid any confrontation at all by giving in.  The writing is thin this time around, perhaps because several of the creative staff were either shifted to or doubling up on Different World.  There's not nearly enough of Cliff and Claire as a couple, always a great feature.  And Cliff and his father need to be in more episodes together.

Formula plots the show did well before are full of missed opportunities.  And the show seems to let Theo show off his body inappropriately in one episode (what on earth is he doing in a towel (no pants!) with two older women in ""Water Works""?  And why doesn't Cliff come down harder on him for it?  The firm and benign teaching we counted on from Cliff and Claire is replaced by silly sitcom banter.

I don't remember later seasons all that well, but I hope they found their way back to the things that made the show great--the parenting, Cliff and Claire, the extended family, and Vanessa and Theo being funny, but maybe those two hit the child actor wall this year and didn't get it back.  Rudy is beyond saving by Season 4--why is she so relentlessly bratty?  Vanessa and Theo are my favorite kids, and while Theo tries to show some range in Season 4, it doesn't always work.  Plus, just give me more Cosby doing his shtick!

Also, two episodes given over to guest stars just don't work--one with Bill Irwin (an entire show set in a broken down vaudeville revue) and one called ""Drum Major.""  What were they thinking?

I do recall there's more with Elvin and Sondra later, and Elvin is just plain funny, so let's look out for those in the future.  Shows with kids as stars are hard to keep fresh when the kids change and lose their cuteness, and that's what seems to be happening here.  Too bad--but Seasons 1 and 2 are still great fun, along with most of Season 3 (although the absence of Claire for one-third of the episodes due to Phylicia Rashad's maternity situation really hurt Season 3).

As for the lack of extras, that's been a consistent failing of the DVDs of this show, and it's probably not going to change.  Why there were no commentaries from the cast at any point in this DVD series, and zero participation from Dr. Cosby or Ms. Rashad would be interesting to learn, but I'm guessing it's cheapness on the distribution end, something which has plagued many other DVD sets of quality shows.",1190073600,9,3497,4.514285714285714

2769522,1,B000NJISJ8,"C'mon ""Cosby Police."" You know who you are. The ones who are compelled to silent my reviews of ""The Great Cosby Show,"" because I dare to call it as I see it. So...I find it amusing that my original review of this drek of a program was muted- I'm sure there's some PC monitors who found it offensive that anyone dared to diss the great Cosby Show. That was actually part of the point of my original review. It was praised for it's ""wholesomeness, great role models for African Americans"" during a decade of Eddie Murphy type comedy, etc. But none of that makes this a good, much less great show. This has all the appeal of ""Full House,' minus the ""You got it dudes."" So it is worthy of sitting the kiddies in front of the TV to watch. How any adult could stomach it, especially in hindsight amazes me to this day. It's full of ""Awwwww"" type cutesiness, endless pounding of ad-nauseum scholastical preachiness, and feel good fashion statements, as it were. All of which perfectly fits the mold of ""The Brady Bunch."" In fact, this show is the Brady Bunch of the 1980s (compare the 2 series and prove me wrong). It's a meandering, pandering, suck up of a show that is funny only to those who are laughing before the show even begins. It typifies the other over rated, unfunny sitcoms of the 80s that were celebrated because TV had to hand out awards to someone. So why not hand it to the wholesome Huxtables, no matter how hammy, saccharine, predictable, redundant and horribly written and acted it is. This is the most over rated ""comedy"" in the history of TV. Don't waste your time or money. You want the best Cosby comedy ever with lessons and morals to boot, buy the ""Fat Albert"" cartoon series. It was actually funny. This one is just plain corny, predictable,  sappy, and so sweet it hurts your teeth. And Phylicia Rashad brings to TV the most annoying character since Granny Clampet of  ""The Beverly Hillbillies."" The fact that this show was number one for so long is an indictment of how much garbage TV is able to cram down viewers throats- a testament to P.T. Barnum's ""there's a sucker born every minute."" Remember, ""Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" too were huge ratings winners. So much for ratings.",1187654400,,2207,4.542713567839196

2769527,3,B000NJISJ8,"I purchased this DVD yesterday from Target.

Before I start, I must say that I grew up watching the Cosby Show and Different World and I love both of these shows.  But to see these great shows being `brushed' under the rug when it comes to getting their DVDs out is very disheartening.  My husband is tickled at me because I am so upset at `them', whoever it is that owns the licenses, ok'd making the DVDs.  I believe the Cosby Show was a milestone for blacks on TV; they made everyone want to be a Cosby kid.  They showed that blacks can and do achieve professional successes and we raise clean, decent kids. And to see that they having such a hard time getting the DVDs out is pathetic.  I always check to see what other old TV shows have DVDs out there; when I see Alf, Punky Brewster and The Greatest American Hero (all seasons) --- You got to be kidding me!!!... The DVD list goes on and on.... Not saying these shows are not great... I use to watch those too... but what these shows have nothing on the Cosby show; but those shows have most if not all of their seasons on the DVD.

Well, I am getting off my soap box.  Again I am glad to have the DVD.  However, I kind of feel let down at the quality of the DVD.  I have seen more options on the DVDs of Sunday Services at church.  I purchased $5 dvds with more bells and whistles.  The only options available are to select an episode to view or choose subtitles.  At least on the DVDs for the previous two seasons, you could choose to play 1 episode or all episodes.

Nevertheless, I am glad that it is for sale.",1181088000,3,1570,4.155629139072848
2769528,5,B000NJISJ8,"Of course I already own seasons 1 and 2 and it has been fun re-watching my favorite show growing up.  My son has also fallen in love with the show.  He especially loves Rudy while I like the older kids because I was a young teen when this show started.  For later seasons, we rely on the old VHS recordings my dad has kept over the years, but they may not last much longer.  I'm glad that more seasons of this great show are being released.  Like an earlier viewer stated, this show is so much better than current T.V. and I'm thrilled that my son can grow up watching them too.  He is growing up watching the shows my husband and I enjoyed as kids.  Okay, so he's out of touch with current pop culture, but is that such a bad thing when he can see a great role model like Bill Cosby?
