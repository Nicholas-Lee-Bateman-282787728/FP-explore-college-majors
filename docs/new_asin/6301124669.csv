7809470,4,6301124669,"Bowling by Nelson Burton
All about bowling: how to bowl and tips along the way.
Even a section for advanced players.  Authors father owned and ran a bowling center.
The author at 3 years old would try, a time when they had bowling boys-to reset the pins manually.
Accuracy and timing it what's it all about.  We used to bowl on a league and for fun and I remember us having our own ball and bag and shoes. When we were younger. Wish I had the opportunity to have listened to this first.
Chapters on etiquette and technique along with rhythm.
I received this book from National Library Service for my BARD (Braille Audio Reading Device).",1477526400,,636,4.474137931034483
