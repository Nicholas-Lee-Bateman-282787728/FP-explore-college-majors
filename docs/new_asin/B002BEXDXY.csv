3893736,4,B002BEXDXY,"Wild Pacific is another excellent BBC documentary. This 2-disc set features six episodes. Wild Pacific covers the remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, the wildlife on the islands, the formation of the islands, the sea life, and the problems man has created. The video quality on the Blu-Ray is very good. The sound quality is disappointing. I don't understand why a new documentary would have a Dolby Digital 2.0 sound mix. I had to take a star off for the sound. Overall, if you like the other BBC documentaries such as Planet Earth and Galapagos, you will definitely like this release.

*UPDATE*

As the other reviewer noted about the sound, this Blu-Ray is indeed DTS-MA 5.1. I was watching the documentary in 2.0 since my receiver was defaulting to stereo sound. I watched an episode in the DTS 5.1 track and this by far, is the best sounding BBC documentary on Blu-Ray. The packaging is mislabeled as stereo sound.",1247702400,32,919,4.773584905660377
3893737,5,B002BEXDXY,"This DVD is fantastic, lots of nature information and unusual rare flora and fauna! Mike Rowe as narrator at his best. Great watching for people who like water, and nature. Some sad scenes of course, this is REAL reality, not those fake shows that pass for reality. Highly recommend as an addition to anyone's library!",1247529600,22,318,4.8
3893748,5,B002BEXDXY,I never imagined so much water and so many islands!  This video is as amazing as the coconut: the seed of this tree is so tough it has colonized all the islands in the South Pacific.,1484870400,2,182,4.055555555555555

3893757,5,B002BEXDXY,"This is actually titled ""South Pacific"" and I must have watched it at least five times on TV!  The narration by Benedict is out of this world as he adds ""life"" to the documentary.  Definitely a must-have for all BBC documentary fans!",1455840000,,233,4.523809523809524
3893768,5,B002BEXDXY,This Blu-ray documentary is a repurchase due to the fact that my oldest female child's mother who was in the Navy had ripped it off from my house. She claimed that it was causing havoc in her household because my daughter through her loves this documentary. By the way my daughter already has her own copy. Nevertheless this documentary is one of my favorites from the British Broadcasting Company.anytime I want to visit the Pacific ocean I just have to turn on this documentary and watch it.,1450742400,2,493,4.67816091954023

3893773,5,B002BEXDXY,It's Amazing Documentary and Blue Ray is like being there very well produced.,1441670400,,77,5.0
3893774,4,B002BEXDXY,"The cinematography is as good as anything the BBC has ever produced. The writing was good, but the narration lacked the wonder and excitement that David Attenborough adds to such programs.
The opening/closing theme was used on a public service commercial recently (Humane Society?) and invoked negative feelings each time I heard it. (kinda sucked for me)
The footage had almost none of the shots from previous BBC programs. Many new facts and recent discoveries were also included.
The only negative part (as with Blue Planet and Frozen Planet) would be the last episode on disc #2. It gets preachy about over-fishing and ocean pollution as well as targeting wasteful things like killing sharks just for their fins. Don't get me wrong, I understand the importance of informing the public and pointing out the truth about out planet...however, I'm not part of the problem. My wife and I don't eat much fish or shellfish (less than 20 lbs per year) and are detached from such issues. It isn't likely to effect our lives and not a major concern to us. I love scallops...but I never buy them because they cost $15 per pound. Don't blame me!",1438473600,,1137,4.8061224489795915

3893782,5,B002BEXDXY,"Wild Pacific is another nature wonder. Very good. Very interesting.  I have BBC Blue Planet so had seen a lot already. Would have found it much more fascinating except for that fact. But, it is certainly worth the money. And very beautiful!!",1420848000,,241,4.738095238095238
3893783,5,B002BEXDXY,An excellent production on a fascinating topic.  Typical of the great natural history productions of the BBC.,1409097600,,109,5.411764705882353
3893784,5,B002BEXDXY,"Excellent documentary. I would have left the original ""South Pacific"" title instead of ""Wild Pacific"" because it is not all the Pacific it explores, but the southern part. It talks about wildlife, about people, about fishing and the creation of protected zones, in my opinion a very complete approach.",1407715200,,301,5.163265306122449
3893785,5,B002BEXDXY,"I love traveling around the South Pacific while sitting on my sofa.

3893787,5,B002BEXDXY,"I found Wild Pacific to be very enjoyable indeed, with beautiful photography and an interesting and informative narration. And for the price, this 6-hour series is an incredible bargain!  Anyone who likes BBC nature films (The Blue Planet, Planet Earth, etc.) would probably find this to be well worth their time and money.",1397865600,,323,5.09433962264151
3893798,3,B002BEXDXY,"Very discouraged when I opened the package and found the british version called ""south Pacific"". The only difference between the two of them is the narrators.

3893801,4,B002BEXDXY,Amazing. I hope to see more on these remote islands in the Pacific. I enjoy mostly the life of the people who are living in these places. Very interesting series.,1391817600,,162,4.433333333333334
3893802,4,B002BEXDXY,"To put it most simply, Wild Pacific is a BBC documentary.  If that isn't a sufficient explanation of quality then you've probably not seen many BBC docs. It's beautifully shot and contains a ton of information that's not been covered in other documentaries.

Like its cohorts Wild China and Ganges, Wild Pacific covers the natural world as well as human customs and history. Benedict Cumberbatch is no David Attenborough, but he's a very good narrator nonetheless.

The show isn't without flaws, though. My biggest issue is that the story telling jumps around a bit - they'll go from the Solomon Islands out to Fiji then back to the Solomon Islands then out to French Polynesia then back to the Solomons. Still, that's truly a minor problem in an otherwise wonderful show.",1389744000,,772,4.877862595419847
3893803,5,B002BEXDXY,The video quality is very good and the narration clear and understandable for the layperson. There are 2 episodes each consisting of visits to a number of different islands and describing social structures and various phenomena on those islands. It is a very interesting and appealing presentation.,1387670400,,298,5.361702127659575
3893804,5,B002BEXDXY,I haven't got the DVD of that yet. The one with mike Rowe as the narrator. The BBC one isn't good enough. When can amazon stock it?,1385942400,,131,3.888888888888889
3893805,5,B002BEXDXY,"I was watching this on TV and thought that I should buy it on BluRay just because the colors would probably be better, boy was I right!!!  I love watching everything in HD and when the BBC does a documentary, they do it right!!!  All of their work is fantastic, picture quality, sound and ideas on what to show!!  You can never go wrong with any BluRay quality from the British, great job on the whole presentation.  My wife always wonders why I buy BluRays or DVDs, it is because I love watching a good program with absolute great picture quality!!!!  If you love to watch docs, this is a very good one and I highly recommend it!!!!",1384819200,,633,4.330508474576271
3893806,5,B002BEXDXY,"This is an amazing video. I often watch documentaries covering nature, both US documentaries and ones from BBC but this one blew me away. I frequently breathed ""wow"" and ""incredible"" under my breath as the gorgeous scenes rolled by. I didn't think that there were many species of animals that I'd not heard of but this introduced me to several new ones as well as making me appreciate their singular beauty. It doesn't hurt that I had Benedict Cumberbatch speaking into my headphones for the length of the videos. But seriously: there are breathtaking camera shots (underwater shots of lava flowing into the sea and breaking into bits of sand; beautiful captures of life underneath the sea; amazing video of remote islanders living lives connected to their island and the sea. This video contributed to my awareness and appreciation  of the world in which we live.",1379894400,,864,4.917808219178082
3893807,5,B002BEXDXY,"If you have dreamed about going to a pacific island but think 15 hours on a plane is a bit much, this shows the diversity of the islands.  It is a beautifully done series and makes me want to take a trip to the Solomon Islands...but not the plane ride.  If you love to travel from your own arm chair, this is a must.",1378857600,,316,3.921875
3893818,5,B002BEXDXY,"Another documentary with a catchy title.  What part of the world doesnt not have some sort of ""wild""ness about it?  Oveall, its a good documentary, worth the money.  Beautiful cinematography.",1378684800,,191,5.3
3893819,5,B002BEXDXY,"No dancing until dawn: here South Pacific does not mean the warm tropics, it means New Zealand and Antarctica. If you're interested in sea turtles or frigate birds, this is the place to go. With an excellent narrator who has a voice similar to that of Richard Burton and beautiful Blu-ray pictures of the local denizens, take a close look at this two disk set, because you won't be visiting these islands unless you want to be a second Charles Darwin.
This set, a part of BBC Earth, will be something you will want to turn to again and again. Save your money for Hawaii, but if you want to be the next Charles Darwin,watch Wild Pacific again and again. It's not as compelling as Human Planet, but it is better than most of the rest that's out there.",1375228800,2,749,4.39568345323741

3893823,4,B002BEXDXY,"Good program. In my opinion nothing comes close to The Blue Planet:Seas Of Life. However, Wild Pacific keeps your attention and has excellent visual footage. I would highly Reccomend Wild Pacific for anyone who enjoys ocean documentaries.",1369526400,,238,5.45945945945946
3893824,5,B002BEXDXY,very relazxing with beautiful scenery. My fiancee and I watch these often at night before bed to relax and wind down from the day.  Highly recommend,1368748800,,148,4.6923076923076925

  I won't list items in this last chapter.  It just summarizes the ecological destruction of the Pacific Ocean.

3893827,2,B002BEXDXY,"I can't watch the DVD, no matter what direction I put it into my DVD-ROM, and all my other DVDs play just fine. So that's a disappointment. So those two stars are purely for the documentary and Benedict Cumberbatch's nice baritone narration.",1364342400,,241,4.761904761904762
3893838,4,B002BEXDXY,Incredible scenary.  Absolutely beautiful places visited in this documentary. We have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Will likely purchase documentaries again that are produced by the BBC.,1362096000,,180,6.16
3893839,5,B002BEXDXY,"The products comes in excellence condition.  The Wild Pacific have excellent pictures, beautiful sceneic views and nice songs background.  It is very impressive and my daughter loves it very much.",1352592000,,196,5.5
3893840,5,B002BEXDXY,"I had read a lot of reviews of this set and detected mixed emotions among many reviewers. Normally BBC nature productions set the standard though so I went ahead and bought it as the mighty Pacific has always fascinated me. I was not disappointed.

  In reviewing this series, I think it's important to mention that Wild Pacific, which ran on the Discovery Channel, is the same series as South Pacific which ran on BBC and BBC America if I recall, depending on which version anyone here might have seen. I think the Discovery version was cut a little different but was basically the same. In either case, what a show it is.

  Wild Pacific is cut into 6 parts, each covering a different aspect of the Pacific Ocean. The first episode explores the fact that there are indeed so many islands, thousands in fact. The second deciphers how animals and plants made it to all of these isolated places. The third documents the immense diversity of the Pacific, perhaps the most important eco-system in the world. The fourth episode is about the role of volcanoes in the Pacific, the so called ""Ring of Fire"". In episode five, the focus is on the unique animals and plants that exist on only one or two islands in the Pacific and nowhere else. Finally, episode six discusses how fragile the Pacific is and what kind of trouble it faces from overfishing, global warming and other threats.

  This series does not cover every aspect in depth but it covers a lot of information, provides amazing photographic documentation of the subjects covered and brings tears to the eye at times with the beauty of places most of us can only dream of. It is in a word, astonishing.

  Good is always mixed with bad and this documentary is no different. You get to see some amazing things but always, the threat of annihilation never seems to be far away at any point whether the threat is directly from people or from the changing world or just from the fact that only existing in one place and in such small numbers makes a species vulnerable from the start. You truly get to see how amazing and how fragile the mighty Pacific is. God's handy work I call it.

  Some reviewers complained that this video series talked too much about people and not enough about the wild life. I politely disagree because in the case of the Pacific, humans have had a monumental impact on what they found there as they colonized it and this can teach us many important lessons. Some cultures have learned to live sustainably in their island and coastal homes, whereas others totally destroyed their local environment and themselves with it. We can learn a lot about what we should and should not do to ensure our own survival and that of the world around us.

  In brief, if you never buy another BBC documentary series buy this one. It teaches so many different things and shows some of the most stunning scenery of places you can only imagine that you will never see for yourself. Truly, it is an astonishing place that no words can do credit. Thank you for reading and please enjoy the blue, blue waters and sandy vistas that await you.",1350345600,9,3098,4.581521739130435
3893841,5,B002BEXDXY,"After living in Sydney, Australia for 2 great years was looking for a way to think back about the good times there.
And boy does this BCC HD blu-ray bring back good memories of visiting New Zeeland, Hawaii and some other places.
Recomended for those who want to know about the Pacific and whom have been there. Stil miss the time with V",1349136000,,336,4.349206349206349
3893842,3,B002BEXDXY,"Like all the BBC efforts, the photography is five star -- amazing.  However (as other reviewers have noted) the concept is all over the place, and the scripts are unworthy, second rate at best.  The volcano episode is embarrassingly full of the most tired writing.  Virtually every sequence starts: here's something strange, or something beautiful -- but wait!! All is not well in paradise!!!! Enemies abound (chomp!)  And so on, endlessly.

(It is worth perhaps noting that it might not be wise showing some of this to small children -- the scenes with albatrosses and sharks are very upsetting).

The natural history seems to have gotten lost somewhere along the way, though ""Strange Islands"" is perhaps the closest to serious natural history.  There are some ridiculous segues: the crew of the Essex might have landed on the Galapagos, if they weren't going the other way, but let's look at the Galapagos for a few seconds....and so on.",1344038400,5,939,4.942675159235669

3893844,5,B002BEXDXY,I saw the series on discovery and have easily rewatched the show 6 times over.  Mike Rowe's narration was much better than Life or Frozen Planet. This is worth picking up on Blu Ray when it is available.,1340236800,,203,4.342105263157895

3893846,5,B002BEXDXY,"- The video is sharp, colorful, and beautiful. The 2-DVD set covers the South Pacific ocean, together with its main islands, lagoons, atolls, plants, animals and native people. The slow-motion clip showing a man riding a 10-or-12-feet wave is wonderful

- It has subtitles. This helps me a lot because there are many geographical names I did not know before.

- In short, it's one of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET",1332892800,,414,4.657534246575342
3893847,5,B002BEXDXY,"This miniseries titled ""Wild Pacific"" seems to be very related to the BBC version by the same name. Curiously, the episodes are similar but definitely not the same. The version with Mike Rowe as narrator has superb episodes that graphically illustrate various themes concerning the vast Pacific ocean. The cinematography is of the highest caliber and essentially becomes art. The music is hauntingly beautiful. The episodes are both stunningly beautiful and informative at the same time while bits of humor are interjected by the narrator. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys superb nature documentaries for themselves or others. I also recommend having children watch the series to both excite their senses towards the natural world and learn about it at the same time.

3893861,4,B002BEXDXY,"Most of the modern BBC documentary videos I would give a 5 star rating to.  This one left me a little disappointment. Filled with beautiful images that leave you with a hunger to go island hoping the the South Pacific, it also leaves you wondering about the rest of the story.  Quite a few of the stories feel cut short, like they are about to share some fantastic fact about a creature then they move on to the next story.

This film is VERY repetitive.  Some of the same foraged used over and over again in each episode. Watching Albatross be eaten by Tiger sharks was interesting and all, but I would prefer new stories to seeing the same images 4 different times. It seemed they were short on footage and were stretching what they had.

A lot of places are left out.  One negative note is tht the last episode is pure propaganda with a major push on so-called global warming.

3893864,3,B002BEXDXY,"Who can fail to enjoy the remarkable footage typical of BBC nature productions? To the best of my knowledge BBC nature documentaries represent the cutting edge in obtaining enthralling footage of wildlife. One finds oneself constantly asking oneself the question, How did they manage to get that shot?

Too bad the producers could not be content to document the South Pacific by simply traveling there and recording and explaining what they actually saw, instead of dunning the viewer with wild conjectures - presented as sober scientific fact - about the alleged evolutionary origins and progress of South Pacific flora and fauna. It seems these ""Wild Pacific"" producers are cutting edge in more ways then just film techniques - they are also cutting edge in trying to re-introduce pantheism as a religion of dominance in the world. For example, the narrator for this documentary constantly ascribes to the animals he is describing volition about what kind of creature they wished to become (and presumably, what they will become in the future). Much is made about the alleged ""freedom"" animals confined to remote Pacific Islands have had over the eons to evolve pretty much as they liked - a caterpillar on the Hawaiian Islands that allegedly evolved itself into a carnivore since it was ""free"" to do so on those remotest of all Pacific Islands.

As I listened to this nonsense about the carnivorous caterpillar, I longed to be able to interview the caterpillar and ask it a series of questions about how it went about accomplishing this feat of becoming a carnivore. Having covered that, I would have certainly asked the caterpillar if it would shed light on the some of the unanswered mysteries of nature, such as the exact nature of gravity, or of dark matter and dark energy. Surely he would know. I would also like to ask the producers of this documentary, Why, if this caterpillar is so unique, and confined only to the Hawaiian Islands; why we can't find abundant fossil evidence of this caterpillars ancestors in transitional forms from herbivores to carnivores? We know exactly where to look.

Boy, I can sure attest to the fact that I am inspired by the example of the Hawaiian caterpillar - if IT can decide what it wants to evolve into, well then I am just going to sit right down and decide to evolve wings that can carry me over distant oceans so I don't have to pay airfare when I visit the South Pacific.

If you want to enjoy this DVD, be prepared for evolutionary theory brainwashing, or turn off the volume and play some nice classical music as accompaniment.

Whatever storytelling elements might possibly be improved here (I did't really notice) are completely overwhelmed by the jaw-dropping hi-def videography. I watched this with Panasonic Blu-ray player and my Optoma 720p projector with 5.1 surround sound and was blown away. Some of the stuff they show in this program defies imagination as to how they managed to capture it. BBC is the best in this genre because they not only educate, they create a visual work of art that is mesmerizing in its aesthetic beauty. The shots of huge curling waves from under the surface was absolutely stunning. The water is so crystal clear, the video resolution so fine, and the slow motion so perfect that you can see every little vortex, every bubble, creating images you have never, ever seen before. Luckily the standard BBC Diaries at the end of each episode show you how they created some of these shots, and that makes everything that more compelling. I thought I would miss David Attenborough's narration, but the other Brit featured here does a fine job. The script combines perfectly with the imagery to convey just how vast the Pacific is, and how incredible it is that life has flourished so well in what the video so aptly describes as a 'desert of water'.

This series reminds me of the NATURE program called ""Nomads of the Wind"" from the 90s. That program seemed a little better to me in terms of its organization, focusing on one island group at a time (eg, Hawaii, Samoa, New Zealand) and explaining how humans and other creatures arrived at each of these areas and colonized them, in a most dramatic fashion.

Nevertheless, this show appears to be equally fascinating, and to present similar subject matter in a somewhat different way, as well as showing a few things I did not see in the older program.

However, this DVD set gives an excellent view into life in and on the Pacific.  Because the Pacific is an oceanic realm, much of the photography is underwater.  There are also many scenes of bird life which are fascinating.  Anyone sensitive to the plight of birds may want to know that, as in nature, many birds meet a ghastly end in these films.  And, as in other of the ""Wild"" series, the films touch on the conflict between humans and nature.

3893881,3,B002BEXDXY,"Had to put this as my own review (other than comment) because it doesn't deserve to be at a 4.5 average rating...it simply does not measure up...I'm usually not that critical on nature/scenic documentaries because I enjoy them a lot. This series, however, was disappointing because it could have been so much better.
  I was contemplating buying the Blue-ray version, but after seeing the episodes on the Discovery Channel(American narration), I have decided against it.....The storyline ruin's all the good things about this program...(very good photographic scenes and some interesting stories) but the vast Pacific has so much more to offer than short snapshots of people and animals....(way too much of people here, IMO)....dedicate to nature and wildlife and you have a better chance of captivating an audience....it seemed like, just as a segment was getting interesting, it jumped to something that quickly lost my interest ( most of this was people stuff)....This show, ""island hopped"" on a fast jet and would not be saved even by good narration.....I'm sure they had lots of good footage, but whoever did the editing on this program needs a lot more experience on whats the good stuff and what ain't so good......The producers of this should go back, possibly get some new footage, and spend about 6 months on the editing and put out a decent documentary on the Pacific....perhaps in a series that could cover several chapters.....The islands of the south Pacific ......Northern Pacific Ocean....the wildlife of the Pacific ocean, etc. (if you get my drift)......
Put the people footage in it's own documentary and an ""awareness"" of man's destruction can be shown simply by providing footage of the natural world and the animals and plants that are part of it's beauty and diversity. The people watching these shows are interested in preserving our natural world and do not need to be convinced and repeatedly shown what man is doing to it.....Not enough of the people, that are the most responsible for it, watch nature documentaries.....( if you are making money from it, you don't give a damn about what you are doing to it)",1256342400,17,2136,5.048158640226629

3893884,4,B002BEXDXY,"For the hi-def nature lover, this is another gem from the BBC, but not an unblemished gem. It has its fair share of problems both structurally and technically. Here you'll get 6 episodes divided onto two 50 GB discs, with a total runtime of 353 minutes. That's nearly 6 hours of footage, so you'll definitely get your fill of naturey goodness. It's 1080i here, not 1080p. From 6 feet away, it's not a problem, but randomly sampling a scene from 3 feet away, I did notice noise in darker areas and judder in fast-moving scenes like pans of palm leaves and waves.

To sum up the series, it shows some of the very amazing and unusual birds, insects, fish, and mammals of some of the 20,000 islands dotting the Pacific. But it also shows a heck of a lot of people. Despite the title being ""Wild Pacific"", humans are in every episode. I found out when I popped in the disc that the original (and more accurate) UK title is ""South Pacific"", and I was definitely misled by the name change for the US market. With every episode, the story keeps going back to one of the traditional societies of the islands, lost colonists/sailors, or modern people.

There's still a lot of informative and entertaining footage, including rare glimpses of animals, impossibly close shots, and more of that signature stunning photography that we've come to expect from the BBC. I particularly liked the cloud fly-throughs and beautiful aerial shots of atolls, pristine aquamarine lagoons, and islands that are scattered throughout the segments (on ""Ocean of Volcanoes""). There's also some lush underwater photography (corals, lava, and fish). These I enjoyed the most. But it's not all animal eye candy and idyllic seas, tranquil islands, and forests. A strong, somber, and perhaps heavy-handed theme of seriousness runs through half of the episodes. ""Strange Islands"", ""Fragile Paradise"" for example (both on Disc 2), deal with the effects of humans on the seas and land, including environmental destruction, wild-life decimation by human-introduced species like goats and cats, extinction, shark-finning, and over-fishing.

What I found to be most problematic however, is the narrative flow of the individual episodes. It jumps around all over the place, from land to sea to bug to bird to fish to another island to people, sometimes even within the space of 10 minutes. This kind of editing is disorienting, aimless, and meandering, like a ship adrift at sea, an image that the series keeps returning to. Instead of one full episode on focused on say, ""Birds"", one on ""Fish"", one on ""Lizards and Insects"", and one on ""People"", its divided into a confusing set of titles and aimless segments called simply ""Oceans of Islands"", ""Castaways"", and ""Endless Blue"" (Disc 1) and the episodes listed above. ""Wild Pacific"" sacrifice quality and depth for quantity. It doesn't stay focused on many of the more exotic animals for very long and some of the shots are only cursory and superficial, lasting a mere second or two. For example, I wanted to know more about the caterpillar with the scorpion tail, the smiley face spider, or the bizarre translucent creatures of the deep ocean (entire segment is only 1.5 minutes). The animals that you've seen plenty of times in other nature shows, you'll see them a lot here too (albatrosses, sharks, dolphins, whales, sea turtles). Meanwhile, the yellow sea slug and pygmy seahorse aren't even named as the shots cut away.

Another complaint is the narration itself. Being used to hearing Sir David Attenborough's warm and affable voice on so many BBC documentaries (like the superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth Series [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-BBC-Natural-History-Collection-featuring-Planet-Earth-Planet-Earth-The-Blue-Planet-Seas-of-Life-Special-Edition-Life-of-Mammals-Life-of-Birds/dp/B001957A44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The BBC Natural History Collection featuring Planet Earth (Planet Earth/ The Blue Planet: Seas of Life Special Edition/ Life of Mammals/ Life of Birds)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-s-Most-Amazing-Events/dp/B001W79MQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature's Most Amazing Events</a>, I found Benedict Cumberbatch dry, disengaging, and mostly monotonous. He has a baritone timbre similar to George Page of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature/dp/B000T9D6D0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature</a>&nbsp;fame but none of the charm as a storyteller. Whereas you can hear the genuine love, liveliness, and enthusiasm in Attenborough's voice, Cumberbatch sounds like he is reading directly from the script. His cadence and pitch rarely changes.

Lastly is the BAD menu design. The white text turns to yellow when selected, making it very hard to see. None of the chapters are labeled with any description. The only subtitle is English, and finally, the six 10-minute making-of segments sandwiched between the episodes are only mildly interesting. I recognized one segment taken in whole from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galapagos-Blu-ray/dp/B000T28PWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galapagos [Blu-ray</a>], only with new narration added.

I give this a reluctant 4 for its problems. Still worth watching and owning if you like documentaries, but be aware of the issues I've outline.",1253059200,136,5553,6.005050505050505

Like most Americans who will be ordering this from this site, I initially saw this on the Discovery Channel, and it is truly awesome. The Discovery Channel version is narrated by Mike Rowe, who has an incredible voice, and does a fantastic job.  No wonder Discovery Channel uses him as much as they do.

Before purchasing this, I saw the credits to Benedict Cumberbatch, and wondered if this DVD (Blu-Ray) would be like Planet Earth and have the BBC version. (For Planet Earth, I actually preferred the BBC/Attenborough version over the Discovery Channel/Sigourney Weaver version, although both are good.)

Inevitably, no review showed up to clarify which version it was, so I ordered a copy on Blu-Ray so I could free up some space on my DVR.  Unfortunately, it is the BBC version, and I find Cumberbatch's narration to be extremely sub-par.  I've done some narration work, so I may be hyper-critical, but the difference between Rowe and Cumberbatch is so huge, I don't think I'll ever watch the Blu-Ray version.  So much for freeing up space on my DVR...

The writing is nearly identical, and English vs. American accent is rarely an issue for me.  But Cumberbatch's voice tone and odd inflections seem so inferior, I can't believe the BBC didn't select someone else (they have so many good narrators...) for this series, which excels in every other aspect.

Obviously, the Discovery Channel execs realized their American audience needed a change, and selected Mike Rowe.  Thanks for a great job Mike, I wouldn't have watched the whole thing in the first place otherwise.

ALSO:  The episode titles and chapter titles are different than those listed on the Discovery Channel On-Air broadcasts.

In any case, the scene with the dolphins off the coast of New Zealand is worth the price of the set, it's an amazing series.",1253059200,17,2066,4.930635838150289

3893887,4,B002BEXDXY,"Another awesome BBC nature doc. The film explores not only the animals of the pacific but also the people of the many islands. I want to make a few things clear:
1. The video quality is very impressive (like all BBC docs), but it's 1080i (like all BBC Docs) not 1080p.
2. I know the previous reviewer said stereo only but the audio is a 5.1 DTS track. For some reason the box says 2.0, but it's full 5.1 surround.",1248134400,15,413,4.175

Even though its natural for their place of living, apparently people are small minded around here :-/ wasted money.. I would have given it more stars but I checked the rating and couldn't find any in the description, would help if this was included to show at least as a pg-13 with nudity. Then I could have passed on it.",1527033600,,556,4.514851485148514
