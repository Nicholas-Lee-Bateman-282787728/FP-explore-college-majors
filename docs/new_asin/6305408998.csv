1024910,4,6305408998,"I have seen this movie 4 times in 2 days! Well, one of the times I only watched the parts Julia Stiles was in. She is my favorite actress and I saw this movie because she was in it. Im very glad I saw it because it really  tells a lot, the people in it really grow throughout the 10 years. I liked  the parts with Katie and I think the when the people are crying and Katie  is giving birth, is the best part. She screems she wants her mom. That ment  a lot. I really enjoyed this movie, so go out and see it!!!!  Also, see  other movies with Julia Stiles, she is a really great actress!!!",931219200,,588,3.899159663865546

1025046,5,6305408998,One of the best TV mini series that I have ever watched. The reunion scene with the kids will make you want to cry and we all know that men don't cry.

the condition of this used DVD was perfect.
I loved the story lines and I really think the actors
gave 100% to the roles...
Julia Stiles as Katie Herlihy gave some really heart
felt moments as a young mother.
Jerry O'Connell as  Brian Herlihy was amazing
the strength he gave his to Brian blow my mind.

1025287,5,6305408998,There is no other movie that will capture the nostalgia of the 60's. Awesome interplay between movie and archival footage. I was so glad that this was not a two hour movie and it had the time to develop and come full circle. It is in my top three movies.,1407369600,,254,4.1

1025289,5,6305408998,"This is a remake, but glad to have it for U.S. History classes.  The original had a scene showing the Beetles first on Ed. Sullivan. Don't know why they cut it as it was such an iconic moment which  I will always remember. Love the music and love singing to every song as it  drives my students totally nuts.

1025290,5,6305408998,I like this movie.  I always have.  I showed it to my middle school class and there were mixed reviews.  It is a pretty decent representation of the 1960s.,1404000000,,155,4.275862068965517

The subtitles are available on the first side of the DVD but they are not available on the second side of the DVD.  As expensive as this movie was to buy, I was extremely upset that it was screwed up!  My husband doesn't hear well so he needs to have the subtitles available to him when he watches movies on DVD.  Trimark get your act together!!!!",1389225600,,460,4.313953488372093
1025325,3,6305408998,"First of all this mini series is/was the best fun time you will ever have reliving the 60's. You are brought down a time line of American history that changed our generation forever. You can relive all the ups and downs we experienced the fun and the bad times as we made our impression on history. Bob Dylan, The Beatles, protests, & the war we eventually ended through our peacenik values.
Now my only issue is that this particular DVD was not as good a quality as I was lead to believe it was. It tiles several times through the program. This disruption is very disrupting while watching it. It is this unacceptable quality issue that forced me to rate this product at 3 stars at best. Seller should have been more truthful on the play back of this DVD.",1372118400,,756,4.4071428571428575

1025329,5,6305408998,I show this film to my US History classes. I realize it does take some liberties but it makes the 60s come alive and maintains the interest of my students while learning about this era.,1366243200,,185,4.314285714285714

Twelve years later, it is still just as valuable. The movie allows me to cover civil rights, anti-war, and the developing feminist movements. I show it over two weeks, and ""Are we going to finish that movie?"" is almost always the first question I hear the Monday of the second week.",1336953600,,435,4.37037037037037

1025440,5,6305408998,"What stuck with me through this movie was the evolution of the Dad's(Bill Smitrovich) attitudes and views as the movie progresses. He finds his world turning upside down with the War, his younger son's Conscientious Objector stand and his daughter's pregnancy and departure. All of this on top of his barber shop's decline because fewer and fewer young men are getting haircuts.

One poster described this as a surburban family, but I'm pretty sure this family is depicted as living right in he City of Chicago, likely North Side. Another worry Dad has is paying for all three of his kids to attend Catholic High School, still a challenge in the 1960s on a barber shop's revenue.

The saddest part of the movie for me was the shooting of a black reverend by police right on front of his son. The reverend was trying to stop young blacks from looting in California, but the police do not see his efforts in all the hysteria.

In the end, Dad gets all of his kids back, but his family and the world around them are forever changed.",1321747200,2,1029,4.551351351351351
1025441,4,6305408998,"Pretty legit movie. Seemed like every actor that played in it, they played the part that they were set to be in during the time period that was such a  historical time in history.",1306972800,2,179,4.264705882352941
1025442,5,6305408998,"I had remembered watching this miniseries on TV when I was still in highs school in the late 1990s.  Now, as a history teacher, I wanted to share it with my class, so they can see how life was in the 1960s.  I was NOT disappointed.

This video got to my within 3 days of ordering.  It was a great deal!  Every where else I looked, the price was ridiculous.  I watched the VHS tape within the first couple of days receiving it.  It did not bounce, I did not have to fix the tracking, and it was in EXCELLENT condition.  I could not have been happier with my purchase.

1025444,5,6305408998,"It was a great and interesting film about the 60s that covered the vietnam war all the way through the hippie days.
I gained more insight into the motive as to why our soldiers were drafted into a war that had no purpose.
How free love became the controversial of the sixties era.
I recommend this movie to all those who have grown up in the sixties and to relive one of the most important decade
in History.  The civil movement, the assassination of president Kennedy along with Rev Martin Luther King
and Robert Kennedy, just to name a few.
If you are a history buff, this is a movie not to be missed.",1289260800,,603,4.2894736842105265

1025446,3,6305408998,"The DVD I purchased experienced some wear and tear. While viewing the movie, there were several times it stopped working and I had to start from the beginning and watch for the difficult parts and jump over them. But as expected with anything previously viewed, you take your chances. My purchase was well worth it to finally have a copy of this movie on my hands again.",1277337600,,370,4.537313432835821
1025447,5,6305408998,"I wasn't around during the 1960's but I've always loved the music and I've always loved the 'idea' of the 60's. Peace, Love ... Woodstock ... it's all I've ever really thought about when I think of that time. Well, that and the Beatles. But when I watched this movie, I saw it from all different points of view. I've never seen a movie with so many different views. It shows how difficult it would be parenting during this time ... it shows teenagers trying to 'find' themselves and it shows the war and how it really affected people. But it also shows a part of the 60's that I never really thought about. It shows a black family and you see how different and difficult life was then from how it is now. The 60s was only 40 years ago but a lot has changed during that time and I think everyone should watch this to see history but in a more realist way. You actually see the transition from the ""Leave it to Beaver days"" to the womens liberation movement. I'd definately say watch this movie ... but not at these prices!! I've always loved Amazon because I can find anything I want and for a good price. But this is just not a good price. It's insane and anyone who pays it is only making it easier for them to raise prices because they know people will pay anything.",1276905600,2,1268,4.243801652892562

1025449,5,6305408998,"This was a great video, especially if you lived through the 60s or are interested in this unique decade. This was a decade of social change that the country had never seen before or will see again.",1229040000,,197,4.351351351351352
1025489,5,6305408998,"I saw this movie on TV several years ago and searched and searched for it before finding it here. I think I paid $12.00 for it. I bought one for my mother last year and paid $60.00. I think the movie is totally worth the price. It'sone of my favorite movies I have seen. I have loaned it to several people who agree with me. I doubt, since it was a made for TV movie that it is in 'bargan bins', if it was I would buy them all for fear of mine getting scratched and destroyed! I think this movie is a must see for middle school aged kids-it's a lesson, sad at times, but that is how our country was! I think it can brings an awareness and show how far many of us have come!",1205712000,,673,3.8840579710144927
1025490,2,6305408998,"I was impressed with the 70s so I rented this DVD and was sadly disappointed.  Apparently, the producers thought Bob Dylan was the only musical influence of that time...not to mention hearing him constantly throughout the movie was beyond annoying. On TV this was four hours long (with commercials) but it just seemed to skim the surface of everything.  This had the potential of being something really great but it's just as if they took the actors, threw them in 60s clothes, and threw in some archive footage with a sorry excuse for a story line.",1194307200,,549,4.708333333333333
1025491,3,6305408998,"I saw this when it originally aired on TV, and there was a scene (right before the 7 minutes in heaven scene) that showed the family watching the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. What happened to it?  It was cut out of the DVD and VHS versions!!  The Beatles were a HUGE part of the 60's and should be included!!!!  This is a butchered edition!!!!",1183507200,2,338,4.25

1025493,5,6305408998,This is absolutely one of my most favorite movies of all time. I can watch it over and over. It has a great cast & really makes you feel like you were there. I have also seen 'The 70's' and I wish NBC would do all the decades from last century.,1150502400,,244,3.803921568627451
1025494,3,6305408998,"This was a reasonably good movie, with one huge flaw:  it completely ignored the musical and cultural force that virtually shaped the whole decade.  I'm referring to the Fab Four -- the Beatles.  They're not even mentioned in the entire movie!  The only justification I can provide is that there must have been some legal problems in obtaining permissions for songs, images, etc.  Whether you are a Beatle fan or not, you must admit that they were a driving force for change (both musical and social) for the '60s generation.  Otherwise, the movie was good (especially Katie & Sara, my two favorite characters).",1139788800,3,611,4.883495145631068
1025495,5,6305408998,"I think the price for this movie is tacky, its ok but I have seen it in the bargan bins and some stores, I buy a lot of stuff from amazon but the price for this movie is way too much for what you get",1122768000,6,199,3.4444444444444446
1025496,5,6305408998,"Watching this film made me feel immensley nostalgic.

Despite that I was born two decades after the sixties, the illustrations of the emotional uproar at the time was so excellently done that I felt as if I was experiencing it myself. The portrayl of the characters development, as well as the Social Issues of the time, was wonderfully intense.

  Many of the sense were so so emotionally rich that I even cried a few times, even when it wasn't a particularly sad scene.

  The NBC news clips furthered the feeling of experiencing the important events of the sixties, such as JFKs assasination, yourself. Watching what so many saw back in 1963 evokes a feeling of empathy for everyone who heard the news so long ago.

  One main aspect of the sixties was the feeling of hope, and that anyone could make a difference, which was clealy evident in the film. After watching it, I wanted so badly to organize a protest. This film definatley inspires the want to stand up for what you believe in and take action.

  For those not very interested with the culture and history of the sixties, chances are that the film still possess something they would enjoy. As an example, the lost, confused, and angry attitude of teenage-hood is also demonstrated.

  Overall The Sixties was an amazing film. I strongly reccomend this film. Anyone with brain waves will enjoy it.",1108598400,23,1360,4.723404255319149
1025497,5,6305408998,"Every so often I get lucky when I take a chance on a DVD.  This is one such case.  The '60s is the story of one family with three children, one of which (a daughter) becomes involved with hippies, a son who serves in Vietnam, and another son who becomes a peace activist.  We follow the lives of each child as they play out their respective roles throughout the decade.  Combined with the music from the time period along with NBC newsclips on assassinations, race riots, and political unrest this was a movie that brought this decade back to me to relive all over again.",1104451200,35,571,4.40952380952381
1025498,5,6305408998,"This movie was great!!  We watched it in my social studies class at the end of our unit on the sixties. They included great clips from what actually happened during that era, and combined them beautifully!  I really liked the way the movie starts out in 1960 and ends in 1969, and highlighting the events that took place in the 60's from JKF, Malcolm X and MLK Jr's assassinations, to the Summer of Love and Woodstock to the demonstrations that occurred!

I would definatly recommend ""The 60's"" to anyone!",1103414400,10,505,4.651685393258427
1025571,4,6305408998,"Although this movie manages to squeeze just about every 60's cliche into three hours, it's still immensely enjoyable. The 60's a was a turbulent time, and this movie covers nearly every aspect of the political, social, and emotional turmoil that America was going through.

The principal characters are three siblings from a white, suburban family. Jerry O'Connell plays Brian, a patriotic heartthrob, who returns from Nam a disillusioned and angry man. His younger sister Katie (Julia Stiles) does not fare much better, and leaves home for hippiedom after becoming pregnant. His brother Michael is the most normal of the bunch, and fights inequality, while pursuing a confusing love interest (Jordana Brewster).

This movie leaves nothing out. It packs in the war, Woodstock, the equal rights movement, and still manages to create likeable characters. It's not an Oscar contender, but it was fairly well done, and deserves a look for anyone with a curiosity about the 1960's",1090713600,10,975,5.243589743589744

1025576,5,6305408998,"I remember watching this series on TV and I remember it being the first occasion that I got to see Julia Stiles as an actress. I loved the series on TV and found myself drawn to it based on it's ability to tell so many stories while staying focused enough to tell the story of ""the 60s"" in it's entirety.
True, the acting throughout isn't top notch but, it is successful. I thought Julia Stiles did a great job of portraying her character in which she had to divert from her suburban upbringing because of teen pregnancy. She ends up running off and becoming a hippy and the story follows her as she is forced to grow up through her mistake.
This is merely one of many storys that The 60s cover. The DVD is long but it's worth it. I would recommend this movie for anyone willing to spend a couple good hours melting into the couch with a bag of popcorn and some really good drinks.",1060300800,,881,4.25
1025577,5,6305408998,"Absolutely great movie from start to finish!  Super storyline that will draw you in to the lives of 2 American families as they experience the drama and joys of that decade.  Wonderful music from Jefferson Airplane, The Byrds, The Beach Boys, Marvin Gaye, and more.  Bill Smitrovich does an excellent performance as a caring father raising his family and dealing with the trials and tribulations of that decade.  The other cast members are outstanding as well.  Many historical events of the 60's are woven into the story, often with real news footage.  This movie takes you to Woodstock, Dallas, TX, and even to the moon with Neil Armstrong. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will cheer as you experience this decade.  Definately a movie to have in your video library.",1057276800,3,773,4.8106060606060606
1025578,5,6305408998,"I've read the reviews, and everyone seems to have something bad to say about this movie!
First of all, sure, the acting wasn't all that great - what do you expect from a made for television movie? Get over it! You're not gonna see major actors in such a small movie. Be glad you got Julia Stiles and Jerry O'Connell!
Secondly, there seems to be complaint that the movie didn't cover some of the major things of the sixties. This makes sense to me - why cover the things that everyone knows about? Why not include the things that not everyone knows about?
I was born in 1983, and I have always been interested in the sixties, and this movie taught me a lot of things I didn't know. If this movie had covered things like the Beatles and Woodstock just like everything else out there, I would have changed the channel and said forget it.
Also, there were comments that there were too many stereotypes - you had the sorta rebellious daughter who got pregnant, the Vietnam veteran who was haunted by the images he saw while in the field, the guy protesting against the war, etc. But did you honestly think that in three hours they could cover all the types of people who lived in the sixties? I don't think so! It would take three days instead of three hours!
All in all, I'd have to say that this movie wasn't all that bad - so quit your complaining! If you think this movie was such a bad portrayal of the sixties, then I say get out there and make your own movie! For those of you who want to learn more about the sixties and are tired of hearing all about hippies and Woodstock and other typical things from the sixties, buy this movie.",1047254400,18,1635,4.311688311688312
1025579,2,6305408998,"First off, a 3 hour series, and not one mention of John, Paul, George or Ringo? what's that all about? The greatest thing to come out of that generation, and nothing mentioned.
I have to say this movie was good eye candy, with passable acting, but the stereotypes were unbelievable.  My parents were of this generation (I was born in 73), and they were not radicals, didn't do drugs, didn't drop out, didn't go to Woodstock (you'd think the entire country was there from all the talk) and didn't walk around quoting Bob Dylan (dear Lord, I wanted to smack the next person who did that in this movie!) They were just normal, hard working Americans trying to get by in a fairly normal midwestern suburban town.  Of course, to make a movie you have to get more excitement than that, but not at the expense of stereotyping a whole generation.
I found Julia Stiles character to be the most real and human (not to mention I think she was the one decent actor in the movie); the Michael character I just found utterly annoying (the acting school of about 3 dramatic poses, 1. let's look shocked! 2. let's look sad! 3. let's look stoic!
and they all looked the same to me); the freaked out Veteran brother was decent, if utterly stereotyped.
I thought it was a decent historical document, but you can watch documentaries for that.
Then again, it could just be my own personal opinion is a bit skewed, being of that 'Generation X' group that seems to be so despised by the 60's generation. But really, I think the 60's deserved a better representation than this (and give me Lennon for goodness sake!)",1033603200,4,1592,4.543554006968641
1025630,5,6305408998,"I think that this movie does an excellent job at getting the viewer sucked in. When I started watching it; I really couldn't just get up and walk away; because it really pulls you in.
I loved all the emotions in this movie, as well.  Some parts are very emotional and sad; some parts are very serious; it's just an excellent mix of every emotion.
I also really enjoyed how they put in real footage from the 60's and mixed it in with the rest of it; I think that was an excellent touch.
Some people have left reviews saying it was a terrible portrayal of the 60's; though I wouldn't know, because I wasn't alive back then, I say ""Who cares?"" if it will get people (particularly people who WEREN'T alive back then) some insight and information on what it was like back then and everything (good and bad) that went on, and teach kids about war, and the segregation that used to be, etc. without boring them, I think they've done wonderfully!",1032134400,2,938,4.390804597701149
1025631,5,6305408998,"Great movie, great music! I actually ordered this movie after having seen it on tv. Very refreshing to see that there are Americans who can look back at the dark side of the 60's in a more or less neutral way. A great example of what kind of offers are required to change a conservative, rigid society. The arrogance of the regent's class and right-wing lobby despite more than obvious signals that their view is flawed.
In these times of heroism and patriotism it might be wise for the American people to watch this movie again and regain the open mind that was present in society 40 years ago.
And if not for this reason, one is almost obliged to watch this movie for the phenomenal music.",1029369600,3,691,4.448818897637795
1025632,1,6305408998,"""The Sixties: The Movie"" is about exactly what we expect it to be about. It takes exactly the same attitude that crowd has taken for years: ""We saved the world! Now pass me a doobie!"" You have the conservative parents who think they know best (they'll learn); the older brother who goes off to war (you know which one) and, of course, becomes a manic-depressive drug addict upon his return (where are all the well adjusted Vietnam Vets I've met over the years?); the idealistic brother (you know, the REALLY courageous one) who joins the protest movement because the war is ""immoral"" (this is the same guy who's more than happy to send a later generation off to Lambakistan to fight for him); blah, blah, blah...

1025634,4,6305408998,"I liked this movie a lot, in spite of its superficiality and ""comic book portrayal"" of the decade.  For sure, it's just a made-for-TV miniseries, not a ""serious"" movie, so lighten up and kick back, Dude.  No serious movie would try to revisit so many events from this unique decade (well, maybe a Ken Burns docudrama ) or pretend that a single family was eye-witness to so much (well, maybe Forrest Gump).  I mean, I had to laugh out loud at the scene where Brian, back from Nam and freaked on that bad old brown acid, meets up with hipster sister Katie Kommune in the bummer tent at Woodstock.  If Wavy Gravy had just happened to walk by at that moment I think I would have died!  But the soundtrack is very likeable (though I see they omitted the beautiful JA ballad ""Comin' Back to Me"" from the cd), all of the actors are actually pretty darn good, Julia Stiles is sooo fine, and Jordana Brewster does indeed have a nice tight end.  So take it easy, all you young and old hippies.  It was an amazing decade which, for good or bad, won't come round again anytime soon.  Peace!",1016150400,,1078,4.355
1025635,5,6305408998,"I use this film in conjunction with teaching a class on Tolerance and History.  It holds the students' attention.
Their are many composite characters, (such as the Kenny Kline role) which are representative of several personalities of the day.  Those of us who were there certainly recognize Mark Rudd, who did not blow up in Greenwich Village.
This film takes us through the student protest, civil rights experience, the music of the times, flower-power, riots, and that God-forsaken War.

1025636,3,6305408998,"I finally bought this movie, impressed by it's sequel The 70's. Instead, I was unimpressed with the script which seemed too one dimensional for the times and the quality of NBC's work.
The story chronicles the growth of an All-American family, the Herlihy's, and the unconnected condition of a young African American man named Emmett Taylor, and his struggle to both find himself and secure equal rights. Unlike it's predecessor, there is nothing to tie all of the four characters together and the story is comparatively weaker. The Wonder Years probably did cover this better.
Another criticism of the movie involves the use of subheadings to tell the audience at what date they are going to be examining in depth for 30 minutes. They are a constant presence throughout the movie and actually detract at times because the appearance encourages viewers to take their attention off of the movie.  This overuse assumes there actually is nobody who knows the basic biggie events of the 60's either through personal experience or second hand knowledge.
This is not to say it is completely bereft of merit. Indeed, the anti-war and racial justice movements are appropriately recognized as the source of great conscience and morals in a time when youth were actually presumed to have less sense than their parents. Yet, the young people in the story line demonstrate tremendous courage and possibility.
As a feminist, I liked how the film hinted at Sarah's Weinstock's (Jordanna Brewster) emerging feminist consciousness from continuous subordination in the `liberated' New Left movement, but was disappointed that it did not show the emerging women's liberation movement (including the movement for liberalized contraception and legalized abortion)-since it did begin in the late 1960's. Although Sarah is as smart as any of her male colleagues, some of them did not wish to consider women as equal partners in social progress. While I believe part of the reason this character did not receive the same detail was her supporting status, it would have made for interesting plot development.
Yes, Katie Herhliy's journey involved the double standard, a medical community pre-women's health movement, sexual exploitation and another click regarding female gender roles in the counterculture, but her character was a main character and she was given less time and script development compared to the men. Essentially, it seems as if she was invisible for most of the film.
Overall however, I would recommend this movie only if people are interested in a conventional telling of the 1960's-complete with the omission of women's issues and gender specific concerns. People interested in a more rounded dramatization will not be happy.",1009497600,,2722,5.22883295194508
