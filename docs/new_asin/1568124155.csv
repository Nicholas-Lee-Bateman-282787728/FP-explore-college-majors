187006,4,1568124155,"This is a great advanced tape.  I have been having trouble finding ones that I think are intense enough and this one fits the bill.  I enjoyed some new moves that are not on my other step tapes.  It was a challenge, but not impossible.",1010707200,,235,4.177777777777778
187007,2,1568124155,"then you will not like this! It is basically the same moves over and over. It is too dance-oriented and I felt like I didn't get that much of a workout. I have tendonitis in my wrists and couldn't do the side push ups with one arm as was shown. I do step aerobics for that reason, I don't have to use my wrists! I don't have the space that it requires and couldn't do the weight workout at the end because I don't have the ""Reebok Step"" and you need a long step to lie down on. Stick with the original ""Step Reebok:The Video"" if you want a real workout!",1008720000,,553,3.990990990990991
187008,4,1568124155,This was a good workout.  I thought Gin was funny- a little annoying but aaah who cares.  I didn't really have the space required for this tape but you make do by altering the moves a little.  The biggest downfall is that the video is not long enough.  Its a great tape though-fun workout-it will keep you step workouts mixed up by adding this to your collection.,993254400,,363,4.373134328358209
187009,3,1568124155,"Bottom line is that if you have marginal space to workout in, don't buy this video.  It's fine until she has you sprawled out on the edge of your step doing pushups!  I felt very limited in the amount of the workout I could do because of the size of my living room.
Also, she spends a lot of time teaching you these lengthy routines and then you only wind up doing them 2 or 3 times before you're onto something else.  Then she throws in these sort of random moves taught by the people behind her.  I don't recommend buying this tape.  It is a good workout but the frustration far outweighs the sweat!",979430400,6,601,4.191304347826087
187010,4,1568124155,"I really enjoyed this video because it's so different than the usual step routines.  It is basically an interval workout where you do a very aerobic phase and then recover.  It's very challenging, but not so hard that you can't finish the workout.  The choreography is simple and  Gin Miller is a great instructor and cues well so you won't find yourself stumbling all over the place.  The music is a little boring, but the workout itself is the perfect length, 30 minutes.

187011,5,1568124155,This video is for serious steppers. It is a great tape and I really enjoy Reebok videos. They tone your body and keep you in shape if you are a veteran stepper. The movements are fun and keep you focused on your goal of  keeping in shape. A must have if you are serious about staying in shape. I  have tried numerous other tapes and instructors and now only do Reebok  tapes because they are the best.,963187200,5,401,4.181818181818182
187012,2,1568124155,"It is not of continuous intensity, the step routines seem a bit monotonous,plus the fact that you need  quite a lot of space on the sides of the step so that you can work out.  Personally I would like more intense  moves, more choreography ,as this video becomes a bit monotnous with a lot  of repetitive moves usually crossing over the step and then down on the  floor.  I was disappointed as at the end of the day you neither get an  aerobics nor a circuit training.  I was dissappointed from Gill.",954028800,,500,4.358695652173913

7796896,3,1568124155,"Tape tracks poorly so you view it through some static across the bottom of the screen. Workout is not her best for cuing, so it takes some time to learn",1375315200,,152,4.1
7796897,3,1568124155,"I love all of Gin Miller's step videos, but I was a little disappointed in the level of this one. I expected it to be a more difficult workout that ""The Video"" and ""The Power Workout"", but it really isn't. There are variations presented to increase the difficulty level, but it just wasn't as fun or as challenging. I can do airborne jumps without needing them in the middle of a step routine. (""Intense Moves"" is another matter entirley! Wow.) It almost seems as if this video is more to show off Gin's awesome physical conditioning than anything else. The power turn sequence is practically impossible (and dangerous) to do on a carpeted area, so I substituted jump squats. If you have difficulty with two-footed jumping from a standstill, this video will give you plenty of practice at it, and I noticed an improvement as I learned to use different muscles in a better way. The short weight workout at the end really doesn't add much; you don't need a step to do the few simple exercises that are shown, and would probably benefit more from using slightly heavier weights and a regular bench.",1062374400,7,1095,4.649484536082475
7796898,4,1568124155,"At first I was disappointed in this video. The box states it is ""interval circuit training"", so I thought it would be like the Reebok Circuit Challenge (my favorite step video). Whereas, Circuit Challenge alternated between aerobics and weight training throughout the workout, Extreme Step, like most videos, builds up a step combination one part at a time with many repetitions, and then includes some training with dumbbells after the cool down. As other reviewers have noted, you need plenty of room to do this workout. The bench is in a horizontal position and, during one of the intervals, you do a one-armed push up on the end of the bench. That requires several feet clearance on each end of the step depending on how long your legs are. Other than that annoyance, the step portion is pretty good. Advanced steppers will enjoy the challenge of some of the moves. There is a spinning squat combination where you do a quarter turn, half turn, three-quarters turn and then a complete turn in between. The step portion lasts 36 minutes followed by a 4 minute cool down. The weight lifting part is only 5 minutes long and I was not very impressed with it.  Most of it has you laying on your back on the bench, raising one leg at a time while doing chest flies.  It didn't seem very effective to me. Finally, it ends with a three-minute stretch, for a total workout of 48 minutes. Gin Miller leads this workout and is excellent as always. It still has that Reebok ""coolness"" that is very motivating. It is not as good as Circuit Challenge but it is still a nice, challenging workout.",1046131200,9,1584,4.613475177304965
7796899,4,1568124155,"I know that most guys do not like aerobics because they imagine leotard-clad, giggling girls jumping and dancing around to techno music.  Reebok Extreme, as well as most of the other videos in the Reebok line (except for maybe Aerostep), is different.  It is more guy-friendly with a masculine industrial background, several guys doing the workout, and a cool instructor, Gin Miller, who does not use a fake perkiness that other instructors do.  In addition, this video is challenging.  There is no dancing and shaking your ""thang"".  You do one-armed push-ups, squats with complete turns, etc. It is definitely not for beginners.  A weight-lifting section is also included. So if there is a guy in your life who needs to get into better shape and won't use your ""prissy"" aerobic tapes, give him Reebok Extreme.",1046131200,2,810,4.962962962962963
7796900,1,1568124155,"After doing this video the first time.  After buying her Intense Moves video I was soo impressed. But on this video the lighting is soo dark.  They have a person doing modified excercises in the background, but it is so dark and she is so far back you can't see her! I am soo surprised at the great reviews on this one, but I guess to each his own.  I thought she had lost her mind doing the slide into a one armed push up! It's not that it was too hard, but it was uncomfortable and she called the moves way to quickly for any fitness level. (my personal opinion only) The camara person focused on the top of the body when she was demonstrating alot of moves so I was wondering how the heck I was supposed to do the move.  If I could have given this a -0 star I would.

7796901,5,1568124155,"This is my alltime favorite workout tape.  If you are in shape and want an excellent, fat-burning, muscle-toning workout then look no further...this is it!  I love this workout tape and I have lots of them to choose from at my home library of tapes but always choose this one because it is the best!!",1032480000,2,300,4.4363636363636365
7796902,1,1568124155,"I hated this video. Half the time you're doing push-ups,jumping jacks or power jumps in the air, not actually stepping very much. If you've done alot of step videos and want something different and varied, then this is for you. I'm almost 6 feet tall, so there's no way I can do the push-ups at the end of my step or the one-arm push-ups in the space I have. Also, the toning really breaks up the aerobic workout. Then there's this subjective scale from 1-10 that you're supposed to gage your workout intensity on, which doesn't even include a heart rate check. What an awful video!",1012176000,6,582,4.5
