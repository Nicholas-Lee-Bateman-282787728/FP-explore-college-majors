5709947,1,B00CAYH368,"I watched this movie because James Gandolfini & some of the other stars from the Sopranos.  Apparently, James Gandolfini appeared in this movie as a personal favor for Steve Schirripa (also in movie).  This movie is proof that Gandolfini was a true friend (you have to see it to believe it)!  Michael Imperioli played a German Scientist.  Tony Sirico & Vincent Curatola rounded out the Sopranos' cast that appeared in this movie.  Notwithstanding the appearance of these actors, the movie was absolutely hideous!",1378512000,,512,5.120481927710843
5709948,3,B00CAYH368,"I was so excited to see a return of the Soprano Boys!  The movie is cute and it is a kid's movie after all, but a little too theatrical for my taste.  Loved the cast including Rita Moreno.  She is darling.  A little hard for kids to follow however I would think.",1376438400,,262,3.980769230769231

We would watch it again, at least the kids.",1376006400,,109,4.238095238095238
8579328,5,B00CAYH368,"Nicky Deuce is genuinely entertaining. Don't go into it thinking it's brilliant filmmaking. It's just a dumb, fun romp. Watched it with some friends and we had so many legitimate laughs. Making it our tradition to watch this movie once a year until we all go to heaven like Uncle Franky.",1515110400,,287,4.647058823529412

It has the cast of the Sopranos in this fun filled comedy.  If  you are Italian you will just crack up.  Definitely a great purchase.",1402617600,,256,4.06
8579335,5,B00CAYH368,Excellent movie. Disc was in perfect condition. Will recommend to everyone. Steve S. Is a great writer and the cast shows me the actors really like what they do. They are also great at it. An actual movie for a vast age range...take my word from a mother of 4. My husband and I love it too.,1396051200,,290,4.105263157894737
8579336,5,B00CAYH368,my son and I enjoyed this movie when it was on TV.  They never replayed it so I had to buy it.  It is very cheesy but makes me laugh.  Good for a kids movie.,1392336000,,157,3.4285714285714284
8579337,4,B00CAYH368,"My almost 8 y/o daughter and my 10 1/2 y/o son loved it.  I think having an Italian grandmother with a wooden spoon helped.  My wife and I didn't mind it, if you're not going to watch it with kids, don't bother.",1380412800,,211,4.0
