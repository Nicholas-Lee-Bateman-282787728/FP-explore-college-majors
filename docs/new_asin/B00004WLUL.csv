1366179,4,B00004WLUL,"When i got out of the Navy and moved to Atlanta in 1972, there was a great hole-in-the-wall cinema (174 seats, one broken) called ""The Film Forum"". George and Mike Ellis served the best fresh popcorn in town, and ran movies you just didn't see anywhere else in the early 70's -- I  first saw ""The Boys in the Band"", ""The Ruling Class"" and ""Phantom of the Paradise"" at the Film Forum.  I saw so many great films there that i can forgive them for running ""Harold & Maude"" about every fifth week...
In addition to two shows a night every evening of their regular feature for that week, they also ran a special $1 midnight movie on Fridays and Saturdays. (In later years, ""Rocky Horror"" became the midnight standard for a couple of years.)
And that is where i saw ""...if..."" for the first time.
I've been an anglophile most of my life (beginning at a rather tender age with ""Swallows & Amazons""), so i had some idea of what English Public (private) School life was likely to be like, and may have understood what was happening here more quickly than some of my firends who saw it with me.
In the context of what starts out as a pretty starightforward-appearing school film, Anderson & MacDowell give us a rather Marxist allegory of modern class struggle, steadily but almost imperceptibly moving from realism to a surreal parable of revolution.
The final sequences, with the little old lady with the submachine gun blazing away screaming ""Bastards!  Bastards!"", the school prefects organising the ""good"" (loyalist) students to fight the Revolution and pitched battle raging, have stayed with me ever since, even when i wouldn't see the film for years at a time.
MacDowell (in his first real feature role) gives an incredible performance that both foreshadows and (in my opinion) *over*shadows his next role, as Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange"".  ""Clockwork"" was hailed, pretty much rightly, as a view of a disintegrating society tearing itself to pieces -- ""..if.."" covers much the same ground, and does it better and more memorably in miniature than Kubrick's huge canvas and broad brush strokes.
MacDowell's Mick Travis and his friends are pretty much decent if disaffected characters; but the System, which cannot tolerate any variances, must either grind them down or drive them to rebellion -- they choose the latter, and you will never think of school in the same way again after you see their gradual radicalisation and the result.
((Don't believe the stories about not having enough money to print the whole film in colour being the reason for several black&white scenes in the film -- the real reason is that for the scenes shot in chapel they were not able to set up lights and had to shoot by natural light, which came in through a big stain-glass window.  They tried some test shots on high-speed colour stock, but the results were hopelessly grainy and the colour values shifted constantly as the angle of the sun changed.  So they decided to just go ahead and use B&W for those scenes, and, when Anderson saw how the B&W footage cntrasted with the colour, he decided to use B&W at other points to keep the audience off-balance as the film slipped from realism to surrealism.))",1014249600,54,3182,4.755434782608695
1366180,5,B00004WLUL,"My review does not have any sophisticated analysis of content or technical merit, just my gut reaction to this great classic of the times I grew up in...  Its a great film!  Buy if...  Watch if...  Love if...  My high school film club saw this movie the year I graduated, 1972.  It left a long lasting impression.  I only remember two movies from the club, ""if..."" and ""The Wild Bunch.""  A recent movie called Masterminds reawakened my interest in searching for ""if...""  Glad I did, thanks Amazon Video.

1366181,5,B00004WLUL,"When I was in high school, we had a tradition where we'd go out and rent bad movies. Gradually, this changed to renting weird movies and eventually segued into renting GREAT movies. One of our favorite actors was Malcolm McDowell, the smirking imp we'd seen in ""A Clockwork Orange"" and later in ""O Lucky Man!"", another collaboration with the great British director Lindsay Anderson (""This Sporting Life"", ""In Celebration"", ""Britannia Hospital"", and, incredibly, ""The Whales of August""!) I grew particularly fond of his blend of sarcasm and vulnerability (vainly believing I possessed same; I may have been right) and as a result became quite desperate to see this rare movie, which was actually supposed to be BETTER than ""O Lucky Man!"" I didn't get to do so until a few weeks ago, fully nine years since I graduated high school. I was not disappointed.
  As it stands, ""If..."" isn't only a great Malcolm McDowell film, it's also a great movie about the 60s in both Western society and more specifically Britain in its post-imperial hangover (one of the last British imperial dramas before the Falklands, the conflict in and evacuation of Aden--present-day Yemen--reached completion in 1967, probably while ""If..."" was filming). The title itself apparently comes from the famous Kipling poem which embodied the highest ideals of imperial Britain. College House, the school attended by Mick Travis--McDowell--and his two friends, is dominated by prefects, or ""whips,"" seniors who control the student body in the name of the weak-willed headmasters and teachers, who represent the 60s radical view of liberal democracy. The coercive actions--cold showers, beatings--administered by the whips to Travis and his fellow rebels prefigure the punishment that would be delivered by the Chicago police, Parisian CRS, and Red Army to student demonstrators and the Czech people in May and August 1968 (in both capitalist and communist regimes the punishments are justified in the name of ""society"" or ""the people"").
  Travis and his friends, the sarcastic Knightley (David Wood) and the pensive Wallace (Richard Warwick), negotiate their travails with wit and cunning and pick up allies along the way, a waitress from a local coffeeshop (Christine Noonan) and younger student Bobby Phillips (Rupert Webster). These two apparently become lovers of Travis and Wallace, respectively. Interestingly, while Anderson follows the pattern of other 60s ""rebel"" movies by marginalizing women, the relationship between Wallace and Phillips is sensitively and touchingly handled. This was a rare thing for the macho boys of the New Left, whose radicalism stopped at the closet door and who generally seemed to perceive homosexuality as an aberration of the ruling classes. The film eventually ends with a surreal, bloody battle on school grounds that, while it will probably make post-Columbine viewers understandably squirm, seems, in the movie's moral universe, the only possibly end to the institutionalized oppression Travis and his pals face.
  Just as in ""O Lucky Man!"" there are hilariously surreal touches to the movie, lessening the shock of its end and underscoring the absurdity of life at College House. Fans of Anderson and McDowell won't be disappointed, and any who are interested in the intersections between film and history are definitely recommended to rent or buy this bewitching movie.",990403200,167,3383,5.337711069418386

1366187,5,B00004WLUL,"A mix of naturalism, surrealism, pitch-dark humor and social commentary in an examination of life in an upper class U.K. boarding school in the late 1960s.  Terrific acting, and some unforgettable moments and visuals.

Although I will admit, as much as I admire it, I'm even more enamored of Anderson and McDowell's follow up, the less known 'O Lucky Man!' - which is actually a kind of sequel.  Whereas 'If...' keeps you (intentionally) at a bit of an arm's length, 'O Lucky Man!' brings you inside the madness.

However, I've enjoyed 'If...' ever more with each viewing, it's flaws bothering me less, it's strengths seeming more special, it's mysteries and secrets seeming to open up.  I think part of the trick is realizing and accepting that Lindsay Anderson was as much an anarchist as his main character, and some choices don't have a deep meaning other than to shake the audience out of their complacency - which is a kind of meaning in itself.

A very good, historically important and influential film.  If you like the challenging, unorthodox, complex movies that were a staple of the late 1960s and the 1970s then by all means you should see this.

To echo what many others have said, the Criterion blu-ray is an exemplary transfer, heightening the immediacy and power of the visuals when compared to the DVD.",1430352000,6,1319,4.8053097345132745

1366193,5,B00004WLUL,"Everyone fantasizes about taking revenge on their tormentors. If you've ever been caught up in the bureaucracy and been forced to go through the  slow agonizing process of filing a claim or trying to get an error corrected, you should appreciate this film. The worst part of all this is you already know what a frustrating experience it is before you start and it takes real patience not to lash out at some poor civil servant who is not responsible for your plight.

Unfortunately, the real villains causing most of our woes are too completely insulated by layers of Cogs in the machine to be accessible to our wrath. This is a movie that shows what would happen  ""IF"" they got paid back for once. Fantasy ? Illusion ? Who cares. It is a wonderful film for just proposing ""IF"". I don't subscribe to the notion that just seeing a film like this leads to another Columbine any more than it could be responsible for producing another Hitler.

One day Ogg the cave man decided to take over the tribe, so he took a rock and bashed out the leader Moog's brains and dared anyone to object. As long as we permit power hungry people to dictate what we can and cannot do, we'll still be back with Ogg and Moog for all of our wonderful technology.

What defines mental health is a matter of degree. Fantasizing about getting revenge on someone is normal. Killing them and eating their liver with some Fava beans and a nice chianti is not. For those that can't see the distinction we have laws, courts and police.  It's far from a perfect system but better than nothing.

This is a movie I can sit back and enjoy just for the experience provided by letting my mind drift in the sea of possibilities suggested by ....  IF.",1410912000,2,1710,4.458333333333333
1366194,5,B00004WLUL,"Released in 1968, directed by Lindsay Anderson with a screenplay by David Sherwin, IF... is a story of three non-conformist schoolboys played by Malcolm McDowell, Richard Warwick and David Wood, who plot revenge. Organized as a series of tableaux separated by title cards, IF... spends its first half depicting the harsh rules that these boys live under at their elite public school, and the arbitrary punishments given out by senior boys, headed by the sinister Rowntree (Robert Swann) and the distant school officials. This is all in an environment of bizarre old rituals, Latin refrains, and hardly more intelligible English public school slang (and of course, it wouldn't be a classic story of British public school life without some innuendo about buggery.) In the second half of IF..., as the storytelling takes on an increasingly surreal tone where we question what is real and what is fantasy, the boys and a girl from town get their hands on weapons and ultimately commit a massacre.

The 1960s was a time of war in Vietnam (and other violent conflicts brought to viewers globally by the media) and youth uprisings in the United States and France. Plus, these elite British school also featured compulsory military drill. In IF..., the walls of these boys' dormitory is covered with magazine cutouts of war photographs, as if to say that in a violent world, it is no surprise if the young too made recourse to violence. In this respect it feels very much like a precursor to Aki Kaurismki's THE MATCH FACTORY GIRL. IF... also reflects the new sexual freedom of 1960s Britain, and the frustration kindled in these young men who see such open sexual expression in magazines and town streets but cannot have any of it. There are a number of films from this era that document the rise of a counterculture and more open attitudes, but few are as sympathetic to these young people as this film of Anderson and Sherwin.

The only serious flaw of IF... is that the main actors are too old to convincingly play teenagers, being in their mid 20s at the time of shooting. Imagine how much more shocking the film would be if it were real sixth-formers acting, though I suppose the (few) sex scenes made this impossible. Also, I must express my discontent with the quality of the audio on Criterion's Bluray, which is very muddy. Still, IF... is deservedly a classic, and Criterion's edition is packed with enjoyable and informative extras, so I can give this a very strong recommendation.",1410220800,2,2485,4.844705882352941

It's an arty film done in both Eastmancolor and b&w that's probably considered very un-PC in these post-Columbine (and other school tragedy) days.

The boys' college depicted, with its corporal punishment, poor food, multiple strict rules and sharply defined hierarchy, seems more suited to 1868 than a century later. The character played by Malcolm McDowell, who came to prominence with his maverick role here, is labeled ""Guy Fawkes"" by a classmate; a peg that fits the boy well, for anarchy is what Mick Travis ""majors"" in.

It all seems so wrong. The parents of these children of wealth pay 623 per annum to have their sons harrassed, cold-showered, humiliated, whipped and browbeat into the sort of men who will one day send their own progeny to such a backward thinking institution.

Traditions are set in stone. It's a miserable life for otherwise privileged kids, but rebellious Mick has his own agenda, a way to fight back that's ironically foretold in a Bible passage heard during a Sunday sermon.

From there we will watch the bunch composed by Wallace, Knightly and Travis (Malcom MacDowell, the brainmaster)of rebel youngsters who refuse at thier own way the rules of game.

The sequel began with Rebel without cause, The 400 blows (Anderson his well deserved tribute to Truffaut's film), The Young Torless, Zabriskie Point, If..., The strawberry statement, The clockwork orange and Catch 22, in which concerns the challenge to the authority within a messy state of things. Of course, this is a crude and bitter apology of the British Society along he sixties, where the instability is part of the existential chaos reigning in a world filled of empty slogans and outdated beliefs.

1968 was witness of the Czech occupation and the reminded French May whose slogan was ""Forbidden to forbid"" . This film captures with absolute vividness those times and Anderson employs the board school as a metaphor as a true microcosmos of what it was going on by then.

This film was the Fourth one awarded in Cannes, 1969 (After A brief encounter, The Third man and The knack)as Best Film.

Don't spend your time worrying about the symbolism and meaning of why the film alternates from time to time from color to black-and-white sequences. The producer simply ran out of money and this device allowed him to finish the film.

Malcolm McDowell is non-conformist Mick Travis who, with his like-minded friends, stages small acts of rebellion and defiance for which they are punished with severe beatings.

At the time of initial release, the movie was considered dangerous and a possible incitement to violence against the powers-that-be.  And in many ways, it was (and still is)!

The film was editorialized as a dangerous, irresponsible film (not unlike A CLOCKWORK ORANGE or Z).  Edited with jolting but effective use of color and black and white footage, the most famous scene is the surrealistic and bloody student uprising against the reserved, humorless, restrictive adult world.

David Fanshawe's flash of African influenced choral music on the juke box gives an authentic whiff of crumbling colonialism and hints at a brave new world, while Malcolm McDowell's confidently rebellious swagger constantly engages and questions, although implicitly and romantically he remains a product of a contradictory system of education and life training, thus, in a sense endorsing it, and now, with distance, evoking elements of nostalgia...",1314835200,4,831,5.351145038167939
1366210,1,B00004WLUL,"Outside of some Fellini films, this is probably the most surprised I've been by the low quality of a supposedly fantastic film. It starts out well enough, and you think it's going to be a good public school film, which is right up my alley. I find the forced situation of public school to be unpleasant in reality but fascinating. At a certain point I took a break watching the film and I thought ""this is good"". The plot wasn't really going anywhere but it seemed to me a nice little slice of these characters and this period in time.

But eventually the film flies off the wheels in a very big way. A faculty member is killed and I was on the edge of my seat. ""This is going in a different direction!"" I thought. Then in a surreal sequence we see him alive again, and right there the movie kind of dies. Nothing makes sense anymore and nothing matters. I'm very shocked by how many people like this movie. It was I guess a smash when it first came out, another thing that baffles me.

It's one of the most uneven films I've ever seen; heck, it doesn't even know if it wants to be in color or not! If it's true that they were running out of money, this hare-brained director should have just put the whole movie in black and white, then we wouldn't have to put up with the jarring and arbitrary swtiches in style. It's also a very flat, visually uninteresting film with a bland color scheme. If Kubrick is pure, this guy is just stale.

I would only recommend watching it if you're a freak for Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" because Stanley saw this film (apparently several times) before making Clockwork and he seems to have been inspired a bit by the tone. There's an absense of morality in this film that we see again in Clockwork, and Clockwork has a similar style of rooting on the bad guy.

The characters show promise but don't really go anywhere. There are memorable things here and there but the movie's definitely a miss. The fact that this half-a-movie is getting the posh Criterion treatment is very amusing to me. What's next, 7th Heaven?
Mostly I rushed to see this film because I heard this was the film that won Malcolm the role of Alex in Clockwork. Not coming in with any expectations, I was kind of surprised that Malcolm Mcdowell's character here, Mick Travis, is sort of similar to his Clockwork character. But Kubrick and Mcdowell make the Alex character very definite and memorable. Mick Travis is supposed to be some anarchist, a hoodlum. But these are only ingredients for a character that could have been. Malcolm Mcdowell should definitely be commended for trying his best. He manages the best possible performance with a character that's a real void.",1311638400,10,2680,4.5309917355371905

1366212,5,B00004WLUL,"I won't waffle on too much about this great film, suffice it to say that I first saw this in about 1980, when I was attending a ""private"" school in Australia (Melbourne) which had similar attitudes to the one's portrayed here. In ""If"" the system is absolute, this is a school run like an army, and a very English army at that. ruthless, brutal and efficient, any individuality is quickly snuffed out, orders are to be obeyed. In one scene the school chaplain is sermonising about how to desert ""Jesus"" is to lead to certain punishment, then he inexplicably says ""and we are all deserters"" and the ""sermon"" is a bizarre comparison of Christianity with being a soldier in a war. This really could be the only scene in the film, where one of the principle authority figures displays honesty and self awareness?

Malcolm McDowell is absolutely fantastic in the lead role as ""Travis"" he just needs to stare, and he appears to sneer, or at least appear hate filled. In a very pivotal scene Travis and his two room mates are savagely whipped, just for having ""the wrong attitude"" a scene which seems to create in my mind the feeling that the rest of the film's ""events"" are really just in Travis's mind, a kind of waking revenge fantasy?

 In a way this film, like no other, shows how this regimented English class structure and schooling system was turning a creative, hormone filled adolescent young man, into a killer, a psychopath. But instead of ""doing"" the killer scream, Travis's scream was a glowering, internalised, smouldering fire!

This film is so well acted, filmed, and edited it should be mandatory viewing for all film student's, and Lindsay Anderson, was really on the button when this was made, only a few months later the streets of Paris were ablaze with student unrest, and revolution was in the air. A must see cinema experience, for all who want to see a film as fine art, and like all great art, it is multi-layered and open to many interpretations, as it should be.",1306022400,5,1983,4.6571428571428575

1366219,1,B00004WLUL,"Some may call it surrealism, I call it a director bringing one of his personal psychotic fantasies to life. The film follows a disrespectful degenerate and his band of lackeys as they steal motorcycles, grope waitresses, and do their best to destroy school discipline. The protagonist is pure and simple an absolute psychotic, look at his behavior and how he speaks and tell me he is not psychotic. With the leading character a serial killer in the making, it glorifies spree killing under the guise of youthful rebellion. I really don't understand how people could enjoy the final scene (the only action scene in the movie), which involves the protagonist and 4 other of his fellow terrorists mowing down dozens of innocent, unarmed people exiting a church. If you cheered that I suggest you see a psychologist, as there's no different between what happens in this movie and the Beslan massacre.

Oh, and the Columbine shooters planned on detonating bombs to start a fire so they could mow down students as they exited the school, exactly like they did in this movie. I don't know what's more disturbing - the movie or the people who enjoyed it.",1287792000,16,1146,4.817258883248731
1366220,5,B00004WLUL,"A mix of naturalism, surrealism, pitch-dark humor and social commentary in an examination of life in an upper class U.K. boarding school in the late 1960s.  Terrific acting, and some unforgettable moments and visuals.

Although I will admit, as much as I admire it, I'm even more enamored of Anderson and McDowell's follow up, the less known, but wildly brilliant  'O Lucky Man!' - which is actually a kind of sequel.  Whereas 'If...' keeps you (intentionally) at a bit of an arm's length, 'O Lucky Man!' brings you inside the madness.

However, I've enjoyed 'If...' ever more with each viewing, its flaws bothering me less, its strengths seeming more special, its mysteries and secrets seeming to open up.  I think part of the trick is realizing and accepting that Lindsay Anderson was as much an anarchist as his main character, and some of the deeply choices don't have a 'meaning' other than to shake the audience out of their complacency - which is a kind of meaning in itself.

A very good, historically important and influential film.  If you like the challenging, unorthodox, complex movies that were a staple of the late 1960s and the 1970s then by all means you should see this.",1287619200,,1188,4.78921568627451
1366221,3,B00004WLUL,"The film was a smash hit in the U.K., but also came under critical fire. Most contemporary critics immediately tried to tie it to the massive student protests that swept through Europe that year, but the single-minded violence of Mick and his acolytes really is at odds with that movement. Later critics tried to portray the film as a precursor to the Columbine shootings, in America, as well as similar `going postal' incidents. Yet, those comparisons failed, too, because Mick's anger is not of the `take all of the bastards with us' sort, but purposely directed at removing an evil blight- one of his mottoes being: One man can change the world with a bullet in the right place. As nave an opinion as that is, at least his acts are political acts, albeit different from his real world contemporaries on college campuses, and directed at no one person nor party, just the oppressive cosmos, whereas the Columbine killers were just psychotics and psychopaths. Of course, that critics continually missed the boat on this film should come as no surprise since most of them regurgitated the meme that the film was somehow surreal. While the film does stretch reality, and occasionally blend fantasy with realism, that is not what surrealism is. Surrealism is when there is a break with reality that is unforeseen, and seemingly beyond reality. There are scenes in films by Federico Fellini that involve moments- like a horse that appears where it should not be, and in others' films, that are surreal, but fantasy alone is not surrealism. There needs to be an initial seeming randomness that, after the fact, seems less random, something that invokes John Keats' Negative Capability. Nothing like that occurs in this film, nor are there any real `poetic' moments. This film, despite some great moments, is always prosaic- in the best sense.

  I mention this because, in the two disk set, by The Criterion Collection, on the commentary track by Malcolm McDowell and film historian David Robinson, both claim director Anderson a poet of cinema. This is generally just a platitude that such moments accord, but it is nonetheless wrong. Filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick, Terrence Malick, Ingmar Bergman, Theo Angelopolus, Bela Tarr, and Andrei Tarkovsky, etc., are poets with a camera. Anderson is not. But that does not mean this is not a good film; just not one filled with poesy. That commentary for the film comes on Disk One. Disk Two has features such as a 2003 episode of the Scotch television show Cast And Crew, which reunites McDowell with the film's cast and crew (save for the deceased Anderson), and interview with one of the minor actors from the film, and an Oscar-winning 1954 documentary by Anderson, called Thursday's Children, about a school for deaf children. Before he made feature films, Anderson was a documentarian. The film runs about 110 minutes and is shown in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio.

  While the film's visuals, by cinematographer Miloslav Ondricek, and editing are solid, it is the lack of contemporary and non-diegetic music that make the biggest impact. So much of what McDowell conveys through his character is enhanced by the fact that it is character-driven, not manipulated via music. Along with some of the great films by Robert Bresson and Yasujiro Ozu, this film is one of the best arguments against scoring films. In fact, the only music in the film, diegetic or not, is an Africanized Latin mass called Missa Luba. While the screenplay, by David Sherwin, has its moments, the thing that most keeps the film from approaching greatness is that it is simply too one dimensional. While we get dimensions of Mick Taylor's persona, that's about it. All the whips, adults, and younger boys- even the nameless waitress, are little more than props to tell Mick's tale, and, while Mick has some moments, they are good pearls on a rather tattered string. The same could be said, in fact, for all the episodes in this picaresque film. Like so many other films that are hailed as masterpieces, If.... is not one. But it is a good film, and, perhaps one of those rare instances when it is something even better than a good film, it is an interesting film, warts and all- from its extended anomies to its over the top depictions of British youth. Its title is often claimed as deriving from the similarly titled poem by Rudyard Kipling, but Anderson never made such a claim, and the title (four dot ellipsis and all- gotta love that!) more likely refers to the film as a hope of some sort, a desideratum, if not of the filmmaker, then his lead character. In fact, the film could very well be a daydream of Mick's, much like the film American Psycho is a fantasy of its lead character, Patrick Bateman. Regardless, whether one sees affinities with American Psycho or The 400 Blows (especially the classroom scenes), If.... is a film worth seeing. Its ability to develop characters (via peering vignettes that move quickly) and mix humor and drama are admirable, even if it never quite meshes into a fine whole, makes it an important film, for both world and British cinema. But, as I've stated before, the import of a film, artistically, philosophically, or politically, is a different creature from its excellence ort greatness, and, unfortunately only the former beast lives onscreen. Luckily, for cineastes, so did McDowell, even if Mick Travis may not have.",1283299200,4,5379,4.87964989059081

The movie is about a trio of friends who are in the 6th form at a boys boarding school, one of who is having a relationship with a younger boy and another who becomes increasingly fixated on guns and rebellion.

Parts of the film are realistic and seem like an ordinary boys school in the 60's but other parts of the movie are very strange and surreal such as random scenes shot in black and white, the bizzare dog-like fight involving a girl in a cafe, and of course the ending, which I found quite powerful because I wasn't expecting it at all.

The story starts becoming sort of a surreal montage near the end. It's well-shot, but still slow and not incredibly interesting. What was this movie trying to say, somebody tell me.. the high school some metaphor for government or some destructive controling force man must break free of? Or was it just an over-controling boys school that the guy got sick of? I lost track of what was going on when they threw logic to the wind in the end.  Finally I felt 'who cares?'

Malcolm MacDowel in one of his earliest films is reason enough to see this, but beyond that, is there any substance to this movie?  ""If.."" was half entertaining, but GREAT? I don't think so.

In his three films, Anderson had covered all aspects, politics, and institutions of British Society from 1968 to 1982 with its complex system of class differences and privileges. ""If..."" which was released in 1968 at the peak of youthful rebellion in Europe and USA, received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations and won the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival where it competed with 27 films from all over the world.

Anderson was in part inspired by Jean Vigo's 41 minutes long ""Zero for conduct"" (1933) about the similar to ""If..."" subject. Like in Vigo's film, Anderson inserts some surrealistic episodes shot in black-and-white and according to him, it was driven by budget rather than style. Malcolm McDowell in his first big screen role and the first of three Mick Travis' movies is a charismatic leader of the rebel students who call themselves the Crusaders and like to break the rules. The cruel corporal punishments from the faculty and the older students provoked a bloody uprising against the school system.

Made almost 40 years ago, ""If.."" still has a power to shock as well as to entertain and it remains an outstanding and controversial depiction of the problems that have not disappear from the English public school system or from any school system as well as from society in general.

I am sure that Stanley Kubrick saw ""If..."" and was impressed by McDowell's debut performance, by his charisma that shines through his close-ups and especially in the final shot of ""If..."", and by his face that strangely combines innocence and youthful openness with cynical scornful almost reptilian contempt for humanity.

1366251,5,B00004WLUL,"I first saw this film when it came out in Britain, having only left a British public school three years before. At the time it seemed almost like a blend of documentary and wish-fulfillment fantasy. As a more of less contemporaneous movie to The Graduate and Last Summer, it is amazing how all serious British movies at the time had a melancholy and cynicism which was lacking in US ones. At that time, Britain had not yet fully recovered from either World War (even today in Britain, mention of WWI or WWII conjures up images in people's minds far stronger than for Americans). This movie was, I believe shot at Cheltenham Boys College, a school I considered going to in the town where I was born, and which my school played at Rugby and Cricket. There were two Britains at the time - the Upper-Middle class one of single-sex boarding schools, with twice a day church services, Rugby, and cold showers. We called Rugby ""football,"" and the other kind was ""Soccer.""  Inhabitants were securely confident that they would rule the world (Frederic Raphael's ""The Glittering Prizes"" offers another look at the privileged at Cambridge University in 1956). The other world was a blue collar world where the education system even had different exams, attending soccer games and going down to the pub was typical.

If is a metaphor of sorts, but only because the real environment of the British public school was so applicable to real life. Abu Graib becomes explainable when you see what happens when you give older boys so much power over slightly younger ones. Discipline of this kind was maintained by older boys, much as NCOs in an army maintain it.

I believe that the boarding school of today has changed a lot. I am glad, as how can anyone feel nostalgic over something which was hated so much. However, the film is quite amazing. I do think you will get more out of it if you know something about the environment.

Yes, certainly, although I must confess to have watched only the movie itself, not the extras. (The exclusive screenplay, by the way, is just that: 53 pages of script, without any introduction or critique, bound into a paperback which carries no ISBN.)

Seeing it again, I realise what a schoolboy fantasy it is: the boys (not the teachers) are really in charge, the sexually repressed matron wanders naked around the dorms while the boys are out, you can kill teachers and you don't really get punished (and what's more, the teachers recover), you can steal motorbikes without negative consequences, and there's a forgotten arsenal of weapons beneath the school stage.

I saw this in the early 1970s while at a public school not so different from the regime depicted here. There seemed nothing odd to me at the time about the levels of bullying etc, although seeing it today, I find it harder to take the beating scene in the gym and the ridiculous speeches from masters and prefects alike about the necessity of the house having the right attitude.

But I think it was a little dangerous to show us schoolboys this film, not because we all ran riot afterwards, but because it illustrated the sheer damned sexiness of being a rebel.

It is all wrong from the very start.

It represses originality, initiative and creativity and develops the desire to be on top one day to become the torturer who will be able to impose on smaller ones what they have been imposed by bigger ones when they were small.

Democratic slavery.

You have to submit to the system totally in order to become the slave master later on and compensate your frustration when you were a slave on the slaves under your control.

This is no education, this is taming. This is not teaching morality but teaching savage displaced vengeance.

Of course the film is showing exactly what may happen when you victimize the more brilliant, the more original because they are more brilliant and original than you are (two meanings intended).

It is the survival of the old feudal education system that was making all children who were to be in the superior class later on be pages or chambermaids, as soon as they had crossed the first year or so of puberty, in the hands of aristocrats.

They just had to do what they were told to do, including personal service to their masters and mistresses, or they had to suffer punishment that could be of the most violent type.

To educate the future leaders of our society by making them go through the false and fake choice of submission or rebellion, being used in the most debilitating ways or being punished with the most vicious means, being humiliated or being violently broken.

It cultivates rebellion without a cause in these young people, and we say it is without a cause without any clue at all about what it is really, because to be humiliated, victimized, brutalized, and even violated is the best cause to be rebellious, though it is not rebellious they should be but plainly advocates of the violent change of this society.

It is that survival of feudal customs and methods that produced the revolutionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries, whose leadership had been too often forced to go through this process of humiliating the future master out of the humiliation itself.

The end of the film then is purely phantasmagoric but it is exactly what this society deserves: good old strong deadly bullets right in the center of the forehead.

This film is the British pioneering version of the American ""Zabriskie Point"", just a few years later.

We are coming back from deep deep under in the dark realm of Hades and we are far from the clear and trans-lucid target of total transparency and honesty. This film, in its way is just as powerful and brain raking as ""Clockwork Orange"" or ""The Dead Poets Society"".

1366268,5,B00004WLUL,This film epitomizes the deep anger we felt as part of that English public school system. The sound track Missa Luba shows that we were not beyond redemption.

1366269,5,B00004WLUL,"It seems that everyone who's seen this film has quite alot to say about it, most of it brilliant, however this is a film that needs to be watched with all preview and review blinders on.  Granted, it can be seen as surreal and may need a bit of explanation about the fact that Anderson liked absurdity to tip toe throughout his films, particularly the loosely connected ""Mick trilogy""( if, O' Lucky Man, Britannia Hospital = school, work + death respectively).  The Color & b/w filming was because of a tight budget and to accidentally/on purpose enhance the message of this film to the eyes of many, such as myself; as I can't help but notice that the switch in lenses doesn't seem arbitrary, does it?  Please approach this film as the ""forgotten main character"", Jute, approaches the school so you can fully take in the experience as he does.

Can life lessons be learned?  Well, often those in power are cruel, boring, out of touch, thoughtless and lost in their world of accomplishment.  The whips under them are violent, arrogant and ambitious to take the place of the headmasters or the CEOs of any corporation when those in power meet their ends.  The rebels are misguided reactions to the whips, and to those in power, often hedonistic and ultimately raging beyond any anarchy to their own brand of tyranny, and therefore are, by no means, a solution to the problem.  Funny how some rebels share a bonding for some of the most mass-murdering fascists the world has ever known. They become nothing more than romantic pawns in the endless cycle of violence that is part of our nature.  Lindsey Anderson and Malcom Macdowell allow you to experience this first hand as the 1st form students by not reading any further about this movie.  This film was meant for anyone who had gone through schooling and survived.  The final scenes are meant to be addressed to those in the theater and not just the characters on screen.  That's really all that should be said.  This is a must see.  For anyone who takes sides, this movie might make you realize that no side can be absolute, or even, right.",1184371200,,2093,4.636856368563685

1366271,5,B00004WLUL,"The exclusive private school portrayed in ""If.."" serves as a scathing metaphor of class and privilege in the United Kingdom.  What makes the statement that director Lindsay Anderson is trying to convey more stinging is that he treats his subject matter as dark comedy.  What I also found interesting is that Anderson doesn't direct most of his criticism at the school administrators, whose crimes are allowing such a stifling atmosphere to perpetuate.  Rather, the worst criticism is directed at the Whips, the sniveling fascist students who are given free reign to terrorize and subjugate their fellow students to the worst kind of torment.  It's easy to criticize authority but our worst enemies are our peers who will later become the leaders of our world because that's the way it is.  The film is anchored by a mesmerizing performance by Malcolm McDowell who portrays rebel iconoclast Mick Travis.  Travis belongs in this stifling environment as much as he needs a hole in the head.  Travis serves as everyman and reacts to the inanity around him with a knowing smirk.  In one memorably hilarious exchange with a Whip Travis accuses him of serving Coca-Cola to the underclassmen while expecting them to lick his fingers for the rest of their lives.  What gives this scene more power is that Travis says it knowing it will subject him to a more severe beating.  If you could best describe ""If..."" I would say it's a dark comedy with dramatic and surreal elements.  It would serve as a good double bill with another indictment of English classism, Peter Medak's ""The Ruling Class"".  On a final note will somebody, Criterion or Warner Brothers, release ""O Lucky Man"" on disc.",1182816000,3,1677,4.907801418439717
1366272,5,B00004WLUL,"In high school in the middle 1970s we never could get to see this movie but we all owned a copy of the screenplay.  Finally I saw the film at a university showing in 1978 or 1979.  I hadn't seen it since.  From the reviews since 2000 it appears some people in the US had it on VHS or DVD but I don't know how that was possible.  I never could find it.  I assumed it was being surpressed out of political fear.  Anyway, all these years later, I'm still not sure I like how the movie slips the bounds of reality to the point where you're not sure this isn't supposed to be just a fantasy (the vicar in the drawer, the main characters not speaking the last 15 minutes of the movie, the charage across the clean quad that in the previous shot was battle strewn).  This shift to fantasy is jarring because up to the last half hour of the movie it is as brutally naturalistic as This Sporting Life (except for the fantasy sex sequence - clearly meant to be fantasy - in the cafe).  Am I wrong to find this shift to fantasy an artistic capitulation?  Am I the only one who thought the lads burning the stuffed crocodile meant this was all to be seen as something like the collages with pictures from Africa?

1366273,5,B00004WLUL,"I first saw ""If..."" during its original release in the late 1960s in a theater in Pittsburgh. I saw it several times then ...which was not the easiest thing to do as a grad student. Maybe it had something to do with having attended a New England prep school and my brother about to start one.

I have owned a copy on VHS, I own a book with the script and commentary by Lindsay Anderson, and I am ordering a copy of this DVD.

Most reviewers talk about the theme of rebellion due to repressive conditions and such. The concern ... I want to say fear ... that it will trigger more school tragedies is misplaced. What Lindsay Anderson has done is help us explore the challenges that are faced by young men coming of age so that as a society we can learn how to respond to those challenges. Why today do schools still tolerate bullies?

When I saw the movie ""Animal House"" a few years later, my immediate reaction was that it was an Americanized version of ""If..."" but with more humor. I am amazed that no other reviewer has spoken of the parallels. I have never read that Landis or the writers of Animal House were even aware of the film. Maybe that speaks to the timeless theme of the film.

This may not be an easy movie for many to watch, but the Missa Lubba soundtrack is unforgetable and continually brings you back into the film.

Lindsay Anderson created a landmark film which captured the talents of a young Malcolm McDowell at his best.  You get the feeling that Wes Anderson took his cue from this film when he made Rushmore, but what sets If... apart is the surrealism that creeps into the movie and eventually takes it over, resulting in its wildly hallucinogenic climax.  All the extras will make this anxiously awaited DVD a real treat, as hopefully we will be able to get a peek into the mind that created this film.  The addition of Thursday's Children certainly makes this deluxe package worthwhile.",1177372800,26,722,4.6171875

If you haven't seen this film before, then I envy you, if you have and remember it fondly, then it will probably exceed those memories.  The only negative I can thrust towards this package is the choice of supplements.  I wish they could have added Anderson's The White Bus, as it is the true transition from This Sporting Life to If...

1366277,4,B00004WLUL,"If.... (Lindsay Anderson 1969)

Even if If... were famous for no other reason than being the big-screen debut of some chap named Malcolm McDowell, that would be reason enough. McDowell, of course, rocketed to fame two years later in A Clockwork Orange, and has been a relatively constant screen presence since. Here, he plays Mick Travis, the ringleader (to use the term loosely) of a trio of sixth-form slackers at a British public school (for Americans who haven't been exposed to this sort of drama, public school over there = private school over here. Don't ask me why.) The other two are scarcely less recognizable-- David Wood, who plays Johnny, is a longtime TV character actor who was knighted in 2000 for his services to drama, whilst the late Richard Warwick (Wallace)  worked with some of the world's finest directors on some of their finest works (Zefferelli's Hamlet and Jane Eyre and Eastwood's White Hunter, Black Heart were among his final performances). The three are pitted against the school's prefects, headed up by the loathsome Rowntree (Shackleton's Robert Swann). Anderson contrasts the antics of Mick's batch, and their treatment by the prefects, with the treatment of the younger children (one gets the feeling a good deal of footage of the kiddies ended up on the cutting-room floor; Jute, especially, seems as if he's poised to become a major character more than once, but never does more than sit on the sidelines). The difference is that the sixth-formers have the knowledge and power to do something about the situation, and they do.

Much of the film's strength, as has been mentioned any number of times, lies in Anderson's documentary feel combined with the odd dadaesque images that crop up now and again and the film's seemingly arbitrary switching between color and black and white stock. (This, I have learned, was a budgetary, not an artistic, decision.) In hindsight, it's also gained a great deal of validity because Anderson's vision has, quite simply, come true many times in the time since the film's release (the DVD box still trumpets the conclusion as ""shocking""; anyone over the age of ten living in America will probably call it inevitable, instead). But what really gives it the longevity it has, in my opinion, is the simple quotability of the script. Practically every word from Mick Travis' mouth is the kind of thing wannabe revolutionaries will go ape over. ""One man can change the world with a bullet in the right place.""? If that's not a call to arms, I don't know what is. If you want the original quotable high school misfit movie, forget Napoleon Dynamite and discover If.... ****",1173052800,6,2640,4.928089887640449
1366288,5,B00004WLUL,"With the exception of the retaliation at the end, I lived through almost every instance displayed in the movie.  For me, it was not fiction.

I saw ""IF"" in former British colony, India in the late 60's while I as an orphaned boarder in Calcutta Boys' School.  I was about 10 then and worshiped Malcolm's character in that movie. His courage gave me the strength to endure the physical abuse I had to endure at the hands of the sadistic principal, his cruel teachers and 'monitors' all of whom were given the power to abuse children - as they saw fit.

I am buying the DVD to add to my collection now that it is out, so that I never forget.  This movie, as far as I am concerned is truly based on the British boarding school system that often times physically abuse children in their care - while hiding behind the guise of discipline.  Rent if, if you don't buy it.  But watch it nonetheless.  Child abuse is still present today in former British colonies.

Protect your children in the hands of people like those, including so-called nannies.  I know some are perhaps good, but others are cold hearted and view beating children (even their own) as acceptable.",1157328000,,1160,4.507177033492823
1366289,5,B00004WLUL,"By the end of his life, when struck with a mixture of senility and what was probably Alzheimer's disease, the great Poet and novelist Robert Graves was only recalling two major events of life with any specificity.  The first, understandably, was his experience as an Infantry officer in the Great War.  That this would cause mental trauma was accepted then by nearly as many would accept it now. The other event was the five years he spent at Charterhouse public school.  In his immortal autobiography Good-Bye To All That Grave's is often able to make light of his war experiences, several of which nearly killed him--notably at the Battle of the Somme where the London Times actually reported him killed in action--finding ironical surrealism and even raucous humor in what most would characterize as the unmitigated horror of the first industrialized attempt at slaughter of humans.  His experience at Charterhouse was altogether different though.  There was little more belligerency, brutality, and attempted buggery mixed idiotic and cruel conventions.  He could find nothing positive about his experiences there.

Whether or not Lindsey Anderson or David Sherwin ever read Good-Bye To All That is of little concern.  Both were the products of the English Public school system and could remember much of the brutality that found its way into the film: ""I well remember Fryer,"" wrote Anderson in the preface to the published version of the script, ""the tall, distinguished College prefect of Chattordale in the winter term of 1936, standing at the door before house prayers and shouting at Hughes Hallet beside me: 'Hallet damn you, stop talking!' And Reverend So-and So certainly had those nasty habits of smacking you suddenly on the back of the head, and twisting your nipples, if you were unfortunate enough to land in his Math set.""  The film is largely about the give and take between tradition and youth's exhilaration at being young  and feeling the stifling effects of tradition.  The film can easily be viewed as a critique Public school with its overwhelming conformity, mindless cruelty, banal customs and idiotic spirit free spirituality the cry against all this is what defines If.... If...is a cry for freedom against all of those crushing  oppressions that can exist anywhere but  here chooses the public school format as the medium to attack for its stifling of youth and freedom.  It is through education  that we see the indoctrination of every new generation into the ways of the hierarchy in Great Britain and since Mick, Johnny, and Wallace all resist its attack on their personal dignity by the tyrannical and conformist Whips.  It is not political, but only a cry for dignity and personal autonomy when Mick tells the particularly vicious Whip Rowntree ""the thing I hate about you is the way you give coca-cola to your  scum, and your best teddy-bear to Oxfam and expect us to lick your frigid fingers for the rest of your frigid life."" This is a rage that it is mostly inarticulate, but one that desperately wants to remain free.

Part of what makes If... so powerful a movie is the documentary feel that it has as well as the fact that the story could probably worked with another medium such as a short story.  The film is divided into eight sections that  could easily work as chapters within a book and make a coherent narrative with only a little bit of elaboration  and reworking.  This would be less effective that what  we see on the screen though.  The contrast of the medieval looking campus, the beautiful gothic chapel and the reform school like dormitories all add to what is rightly called by Richard Schickel a film that is less seen than felt.  Seeing Rowntree as we do in one of the first scenes of the film order the junior Markland to warm a lavatory seat for him creates what can only be described as an environment of degradation.  Our disgust with the Whips simply grows and grows as we watch the Whips treating the young scholars with nothing more than arbitrary cruelty that infects the behavior of all four of them.  So self-important are the Whips that when confronted with the rather none dire defiance of long hair on the part of Mick, Wallace, and Johnny they brutally cane them, showing exactly where the power of tradition ultimately lays--its power to physically compel obedience through violence when all else fails.  Though easily adaptable to literature nothing quite conveys the feeling of retan on flesh as the sound of it cracking.

Part of what also makes this film so powerful is that it is able to draw between the subject matter of traditional education and the traditions that are bound up with in it. As Anderson points out: ""If this story  can be said to be about anything, it is about freedom,"" and ""the world rallies as it always will brings its overwhelming fire-power to bear on the man who says `no.'""  This happens while the Whips, the most arch- conformists climb the rungs of social dominance in the areas of business, politics, military and arts. There understanding of freedom is their own self-advancement and aggrandizement: utterly cynical.  There concept is no different than fulminations of the old dotard General Denson, whom ultimately can not even tell that a floor is on fire underneath him as he gives a rambling speech about duty, honor and country. It is finally the revolutionaries in the last scene of the film with their emulation of Mao, Che and Lenin who become the true heirs to Shakespeare's tongue and the Englishman's perennial resistance to tyranny: even if fairly immature in their execution.

The only aspect of the film that I found truly disquieting was the final treatment of the College's Headmaster at the film's close.  He is constantly trying to show understanding and sympathy with all the students and any viewer gets the feeling that he truly does mean well and has no desire to stifle youth or the dignity that all individuals are entitled to.  When Mick, Johnny and Wallace use live ammunition during a routine school military exercise they are barely reprimanded and their demeanor is finally no longer in question.  As the Headmaster notes: ""So often have I noticed that it is the hair rebels who step into the breach when there is a crisis--whether it be a fire in the House, or to sacrifice a week's holiday  in order to a party of slum children seven days in the country.""  Furthermore he believes their rebellion can be channeled into service and tries desperately to it to them in the days just before their violent revolt. The Headmaster's final line of the film: ""Boys, boys, boys! I understand you .  Listen to reason and trust me. Trust me!"" This last line earns him a bullet in the forehead.  Is this a comment on youth's obstinacies and arrogance, its short-sightedness and cruelties?  Is it a manifestation of that 60's bugaboo called the generation gap?  I am not sure and will have to leave that question viewers, like you, better able to answer such a question than myself.",1156204800,4,7010,4.841575859178541

Interesting reading the reviews by some US viewers- they seem to assume it is much more metaphorical and symbolic than it actually is.

While Mike Nichols was gently tweaking the establishment here in the States with ""The Graduate,"" director Lindsay Anderson was giving it a hearty middle finger on the other side of the Atlantic. Three years before his more celebrated performance as Alex in Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange,"" Malcolm McDowell led a similar rebellion as Mick Travis, chieftain of a small tribe of noncomfortist students at a British prep school.

The repressive nature of England's boarding schools is now a familiar theme, but at the time it was a bit of a revelation, and the film's scholastic setting allows for a perfect microcosmic statement on the cultural revolts of the 60's: Those who wield power are shown to be almost entirely debauched and out of touch, and the seemingly benign insubordination of Mick and his cohorts escalates to an unexpected and astonishing conclusion. There is something senseless and yet inextricably linked about the entire dynamic.

There is just one thought I would like to add to the reviews of this movie that have been written here and that is ""love can assist the move to violence"".

I think this was one of the ideas the writers and director were showing. I have heard it argued even with the recent violence on an Indian Reservation in the North of the USA that if only the boy had received love he would not have done what he did in his school. I have also heard that argument put forward about ""Columbine"". However I noticed as a sergeant back in Vietnam times that love in the platoon assisted in increasing levels of violence that were able to be performed.

In this movie ""IF"" there is one definite forming of love between the younger student and the older student. In the last scene the younger was handing a mortar shell to the older to blast away at the faculty and students. They were working together as a team.

Love is only a first step to solving our societies problems. I think that might have been one of the things that was trying to be said in this movie. The second step I think that was trying to be said was for us to find non-violent ways to do that, other wise: ""Columbine"".  Anderson, Sherwin and Howlett had no way of knowing ""Columbine"" was coming. This might be a stretch but I bet those two boys loved each other too.",1117670400,,1453,4.227436823104693

1366296,5,B00004WLUL,"""Wisdom is the principal thing.  Therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting, get understanding.""  --Proverbs IV:2
The opening quote from Lindsay Anderson's if... is what three sixth formers (one year away from being seniors) named Travis, Knightley, and Wallace strive for, in a revolutionary way.  (Note:  there are seven forms {grades to us Yanks} in a British school below university level).
This is also the story of Jute, the first former who's nervous in his debut at College House.  It's a strange new world, but it's stifling, rigid, full of discipline, conformity, obedience, and an adherence to religion and national pride.  Figures--since they lost an empire, now they turn on their own people for their mass state.  Mr. Kemp, a professor, tells the first formers:  ""We are your new family and you must expect the rough and tumble that goes with any family life.  We're all here to help each other.  Help the House and you'll be helped by the House.""  Professors, the student whips, and the bishop are the authority figures to be reckoned with.  Jute is pressured into learning the names of the seniors and pronouncing school terminology correctly--e.g. local girls are called local tarts.  But this is a well-known slice of British culture, the British boarding school.  The communal study areas, dining halls, rugby matches, mandatory church attendance, war games,... it's all there.  Scenes in b&w at times underline the lifelessness and austerity of the school, but also serve as a moving photograph that mirrors that photos Travis collects in his dorm room.
Speaking of which, the ongoing turmoil is a backdrop in the form of LIFE magazine-style photos of Vietnam, civil strife in African countries, soldiers, predatory animals, portraits of Che Guevara and Mao Tse-tung strewn in Travis and co.'s room.  Travis utters his revolutionary credo while reading from a book:  ""The whole world will end soon--black brittle bodies peeling to ash.""  ""There's no such thing as a wrong war.""  ""Violence and revolution are the purest acts.""  ""War is the last possible creative act.""
There are hazings, instructors who are bored, instructors who fondle students, but there's also a headmaster who tries to be understanding, as he does to Travis and company.  He tells them that to proclaim individuality is sense of existentialism and that it's the hair rebels that step in the breach.  But do society and the establishment really value the rebel, without whom there is no progress?
 Various scenes spell out the positive and more refreshing emotions.  Release is found in the fencing between the three rebels.  The sight of blood is reality.  Also, the smell of freedom is expressed when the girl whom Travis and Knightley meet at the coffee shop stands atop their stolen motorcycle, arms outstretched as if in flight, a smile of ecstasy on her face, with choir song ""Sanctus"" from the Missa Luba playing.
One b&w scene that made an anti-war statement was that of the nude Matron alone in the school while the boys and instructors are out on war games.  She walks inside the dorm rooms, handling one of the boys' clothes.  It's that maternal instinct of longing for children as well as the simplicity and beauty of her nudity in contrast to the ugliness of war.  But it also denotes the contrast of the peaceful interior to the violence going on outside.
Malcolm McDowell (Travis) is wonderful in his starring debut as the leader of the ""crusaders.""  A host of well-known British actors include Graham Crowden as the history professor, (Waiting For God series), Arthur Lowe as Mr. Kemp (Bless Me Father series), and Peter Jeffrey as the headmaster who tries to understand the three rebels.
The final scene generates a lot of debate and controversy but it's an apt denouement of what has been portrayed up to that point.  An artfully executed film not to be missed.",1028851200,44,3872,4.96583850931677
1366297,5,B00004WLUL,"One of the great movies from the 60's -- or any other decade.  When originally viewed in that time of civil disobedience and resistance to ""authority"" it was riveting, provocative, and stirring.  But that was then, this is now.  As great as the ending was during its original release, all who saw it knew that it was still fantasy -- an insightful comment on the suffocating strictures of public morality and convention.  Now the fantasy has become reality.  Columbine, Palestine, and 9/11 have shown us what Travis and his friends already knew -- that a single bullet (or act) can change history, and that those unafraid to die are the ones to be feared the most.  There was nothing inherently sinister about the boys of College House. They were the children of the establishment.  Children of the privileged, unlike the borstal boys of ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"". Travis was not born to violence, he was driven there by things that should not have done so -- patriotism, reasonableness, and the ""consequences"" of resisting authority.  Who dares to draw the line between a revolutionary and a terrorist?  Do you find the actions of today's ultra-radicals incomprehensible?  Try examining the labyrinthine psychological journeys portrayed in this incredible film.  Did Anderson realize what he had done here?  Sometimes, it seems, the creation acquires insights and takes on a meaning of its own, regardless of the intent of the creator.  Pogo was right.",1022716800,14,1472,5.033057851239669

As the reviewer says, ""Although its intent is clear, part of the fascination of if. is that its effect is ambiguous."" I perceived in the boys a sharp intelligence, and it was fascinating that they seemed to be distinctly aware it. I was also intrigued by the themes of contempt for authority, power relations, and the movie's sexual elements  especially the homosexual leitmotif  which all gave me a storm of ideas.",1481760000,,495,4.811764705882353

A progressive look at the rituals and relationships among the socially stratified boys and the development of resentment and anger. Unusually shot in color and black and white. Mildly interesting. Slow, erotic, violent, bizarre at times. Coming of age as anger. This film was rated X when released. If you have an interest in British films of this period, give it a try.
