511926,5,6302783356,"I first saw this film as a wide-eyed college student in the 1970s, and it literally changed my life.  That doesn't mean that it doesn't speak to more (or less) mature audiences.  Anyone, looking back and examining his  life--which we all do at various times--can identify with this film and its  protagonist. In fact, this is one of those movies that I watch annually.  This is also the movie that first showed me--back those many years  ago--that movies can be more than the standard Hollywood fare (and some of  my favorite movies ARE Hollywood fare). The opening dream sequence is  startling, and not like anything I had seen in a movie before. The movie  has its flaws: I'm not sure the ""hitchhiking teenagers"" really  work, but there are so many other things in this film that work perfectly.  And the concluding scene--of the elderly Isak Borg finally remembering his  long-dead parents fondly, sitting peacefully on a river bank fishing in the  distance always brings me to tears--even more so since my own parents  passed away. This is a movie everyone should see--so get over your silly  aversion to black & white and subvert your subtitle-phobia and watch  this classic.",931305600,9,1180,4.8542713567839195
511927,5,6302783356,"First warning - I was a film major and therefore my tastes are not mainstream at all.  My preferences evolved towards directors who focus on telling their narrative by take painstating care on each frame necessary.  My favorite mainstream directors are Kubrick, Allen and Scorsese.  Woody  Allen himself is a Ingmar Bergman student and I have always thought his  film ""Another Woman"" was molded after Bergman's ""Wild  Strawberries""
Only a few times in my life have I had the pleasure of  being stunned by a film.  The first viewing of the film simply blew me with  the vision and the unfolding story and deconstruction of the main  character.
As all Bergman films this is masterfully shot with fine  acting.  It deals with dark themes of death and the life reflections of a  elderly man on a journey to receive a honorary degree.
Simply put it is a  film makers, film.  Without a mature knowledge of the medium it is unlikely  the casual viewer will find the experience anything but a cure for  insomnia.  It should fit the bill for those who enjoy a mature character  studies, regardless of pace or action included.  This film has made  numerous ""Best films of all time"" lists as compiled by scholars  and film academies.

511967,4,6302783356,"An old doctor (a magnificent performance by Victor Sjostrom) takes a car trip to receive an award for 50 years in medicine, accompanied by his daughter in law, and some teenage hitchhikers they pick up.

He is tormented by highly symbolic dreams (beautifully done), and by the realization he has kept himself at an emotional distance from others and the world, and now his life is racing towards it's end.

Quite moving in spots, but somehow never ended up with as much power as I expected.

Two critics' notes made sense to me. One said that, for as great and transparent as Sjostrom's performance is, he is so sweet and likable a presence it's hard to reconcile him with a man his daughter in law openly admits she doesn't like because of his cold nature.

The other point - which could also be applied to 'The Seventh Seal' is that the film seems less special today because the stylistic barriers it broke and the doors it opened (an almost totally subjective film, dream sequences of depth and meaning, etc) have since become a familiar part of film grammar. But at the time, this was something new and brave. Another to re-see.

Note: I haven't seen this transfer to compare it with the Criterion/Janus transfer, but the other Bergmans I've seen from Korea were surprisingly good.  That said, with the Criterion and Janus versions selling at reasonable prices, I'm nit sure why one wouldn't go with one of those instead of rolling the dice...",1453680000,,1447,4.699604743083004

511969,2,6302783356,"This is not a review of the film, but rather a complaint against Criterion for always using hard to read white subtitles that are sometimes impossible to read against white backdrops. English company Eureka for example uses better readable subtitles. This continuing strategy by Criterion is really annoying. What's the use of a perfect Bluray picture with weak subtitles. The irony is that the subtitles on the DVD's by criterion are really good when playing black and white pictures.
It's really sad since Wild strawberries is not the only victim of Bad subtitles on Bluray. Check out also (The rules of the game, Persona, Band of outsiders, Vivre sa vie.....and many many black and white movies).

What is death, that we should fear it so much? What is life, that is so fleeting?

512008,4,6302783356,"Wild Strawberries is a subtle and meditative film by Ingmar Bergman.  The protagonist looks back on his life with regret and sorrow but he also finds things to appreciate that bring fulfillment and joy to his life.  My favorite scene is the dream sequence where he is in the empty street with the clocks with no hands.

Though the film is somewhat slow, I feel there are things you can take away from it that relate to your own life.  The black and white photography is stunning and crisp.  I highly recommend this film.",1412294400,,520,4.48936170212766

512012,5,6302783356,"There is a quality to Ingmar Bergman's films that make them timeless. Writers such as John Steinbeck, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and most prominently, William Shakespeare, all share the same timeless characteristics in their works. They all examine the human condition in a mostly dark and tragic light. They all ask the big questions that existed since the dawn of the self-aware mammal and will continue to exist for as long as humans do. This is what makes them all such well known and well respected artists whose work will be passed on from generation to generation. This importance is actually a major part of the multi-generational uncertainty in Wild Strawberries. The film follows an elderly man who is being awarded an honorary degree for his work as a doctor for half a century. Instead of being proud of his achievement, he spends the hours before the ceremony thinking not of his celebration but of his own mortality and unsureness. Through several excellent dream sequences, we are shown that even though he is an old and revered man, he still feels a lack of confidence in himself and has spent the most of his personal life in disappointment. Still, the past, no matter how grim, seems rosy through the eyes of an old man. Wild Strawberries comes off as a swan song for a legendary director who is old and dying. The fact Bergman was not even forty when he wrote and directed the film is perhaps its most amazing quality. Visually, it's mesmerizing. Bergman exhibits such a vast control of the stark black-and-white photography. The haunting nightmare sequences are shot in such simple and eery way that makes them deeply unsettling. The use of music, especially during the dream scenes, is brilliant. Wild Strawberries can get almost deathly quiet at times, which is almost as unnerving as the chilling violins that make up the soundtrack. Victor Sjstrm, who essentially came out of retirement for the film, is masterful as Isak. It's truly a shame that he acted in so few films in his lifetime. Also excellent are Ingrid Thulin and Bibi Andersson in a double role. Wild Strawberries is generally considered to be among Bergman's very best films. And Bergman being one of the best directors of the 20th century, that makes Wild Strawberries one of the greatest films ever made. Objectively, there is little argument against that claim.",1402358400,2,2344,4.891959798994975
512013,5,6302783356,"Wild Strawberries is a very beautiful, and haunting film about an aging medical professor forced to face his own mortality, as he travels to a university to receive an honorary degree.

I truly felt sympathy and pain for this grizzled, broken-down old man, as he struggles to come to terms with his failures.

Aesthetically this movie is superb. Bergman uses darkness as well as light to great effect. The set design works very well, and the dream sequences are truly terrifying. It's a masterpiece.",1401926400,,586,5.041237113402062

Though with Japanese sensibilities and an emphasis on marital love, it has many of the same themes but an ending that is quite different.

**Spoiler Alert**  Existential, dramatic, theatrical, shocking at times, with great poignancy and themes of loss and regret similar to those in Wild Strawberries, rather than the protagonist just facing and accepting his looming mortality, in Cherry Blossoms he retains his agency and symbolic power and goes out with a big triumphant BANG.  It occurred to me while leaving a review of it that other Ingmar Bergman fans might like it as much as I.",1384387200,2,956,5.8
512042,4,6302783356,"Although this film deals with the end of the life of an old man and the haunting  that continues to remind him of his past and his many faults and mistakes, it is NOT a depressing film from Bergman, as for example the GHOULISH ""Cries and Whispers"" (in itself a masterly film).

Having had the opportunity to have been very intimate with a person in his eighties, and having grown with elderly people I have always had the deepest respect for the old.

What strikes me as extraordinarily exceptional is that the protagonist is played by what I come to know was a veteran Swedish director, Mr. Victor Sjostrom. As you may know, it took a lot of convincing for him to accept the role, and even more of a profound discipline to complete the film. Sometimes everybody thought that he would die during the filming. But what is more important is that no doubt the entire story must have been a mirror to his own decay, even if not the character's idiosincrasies.

The protagonist is a famous Doctor, but it appears that never do we know of what, who is to be given a ""prize"" medal of recognition for his lifetime achievements.
But the doctor appears not to have been exactly what he has slowly mellowed into-------a mostly sweet, tender, fragile, engaging soul who is generally liked by most around him. His daughter-in-law, played by the great Ingrid Thulin (watch her in ""The Damned"" by Visconti)---------or is it Bibi Andersson? I am embarrased at my confusion-----please correct me if you may-----is HERSELF haunted and suffering for her failed marriage to the doctor's arrogant son. Thulin (Andersson?) is extraordinary, and quietly beautiful with her patrician looks and carriage.

The doctor has no future, of course, only the past and, precariously, little of the present.
What he has is a past that continues to oppress him by way of nightmares that are full of symbolism that curiously remind you of Bunuel's, though Bergman does not carry with him all that ridiculous moralizing and political ""marxist-leninist"" credo of so many of his (reluctantly, great, yes) movies.
Yet some of the symbolism is heavy-handed and difficult for this proud writer to figure out (I confort myself by ""believing"" I do not care...ha!).
No worry. It is, of course, his mortality and EXTINCTION which follows him everywhere.
What is troubling is that we are not shown, among so many remembrances, dreams, hallucinations?, whatever the great sins of this man are. In a sense it is unnecessary, since we can easily perceive they are primarily PRIDE (aaah! Dante's WORST SIN!), garrulousness (which, we somewhat funnily are  presented  with at the beginning of the movie in a quarrel with his lifelong servant, caregiver,valet, multi-tasker) and it is a measure of the man (perhaps really of his haute-bourgeois milieu) that after some 50-odd years he pleads with her to call each other by their first names. Aaah, old age taking care of all your transgressions and stupid facades of self-protectiveness for all your fears.
It is a tender movie, and one to see perhaps every year as a ""lesson"" in how to grow old with less ""baggage"" (as if we were to battle and win that LOOOONG struggle with that horrible enemy loosely called our EGO---well, at least its rotten part).......Of course..............
I am not familiarized with Bergman's personal life, but it makes me wonder how much the movie itself came to oppress or RELIEVE this BRILLIANT SAGE in his last days itself...............
A most rewarding, candid, brutally honest look at decay, and a light shining upon what is the profound complexity of slowly embracing our end.",1379721600,,3609,4.906557377049181

512065,5,6302783356,"Along with classics like ""Ikiru"", ""Tokyo Story"", and ""Umberto D"", the 1957 Swedish masterpiece ""Wild Strawberries"" is one of the greatest films about old age ever made.  With Ingmar Bergman's lyrical and sensitive direction and Gunnar Fischer's fairly expressionistic black-and-white cinematography, the film tells the tale of an old man who reminisces about his past that is filled with loss, regrets, and loneliness.  The film is in several respects similar to Federico Fellini's 1963 film ""8 1/2"".  Both films open with a nightmare sequence, and mix dreams, flashbacks, and reality throughout the narrative. Both are about a lonely and disillusioned intellectual who embarks on a journey of self-examination.  Both men in the films are haunted by the past and tormented by the present, and have to deal with unsettling issues about their lives, their work, and their beliefs.  And both ultimately manage to reach some sort of emotional closure.

Criterion's Region-A Blu-ray release of ""Wild Strawberries"" looks stunningly beautiful, making Fischer's gorgeous deep-focus cinematography irresistible to look at.  A new 2K transfer was made for this Blu-ray, yielding a nearly pristine picture, in its original 4:3 screen aspect ratio.  The 2002 Criterion DVD edition (all-region NTSC) still holds its own, but the eleven-year-old print pales in comparison to the Blu-ray, especially in the presentation of high contrast and deep blacks, which the Blu-ray format is inherently a superior medium for presenting such elements.

Swedish dialogs in the film are supported by optional English subtitles, which look to be identical on both the Blu-ray and DVD (see postscript below for one exception).  The DVD's subtitles are white letters with black borders.  The Blu-ray's subtitles are also white letters, but with thinner, greyer borders, the same font used in all black-and-white Criterion Blu-rays that I have seen.  Criterion should consider using a darker border to make the words easier to read against a light or mosaic background.  The opening credits are in Swedish on the Blu-ray and DVD.  Older viewers may recall that Criterion made a 1991 laserdisc that had English opening credits.

The Blu-ray does not carry over the DVD's picture gallery, which contains 30 or so production photos, actor portraits, and international posters for ""Wild Strawberries"".

The Blu-ray does retain the DVD's full-length audio commentary by film historian Peter Cowie (who also recorded a commentary for Criterion's ""The Seventh Seal"" DVD and Blu-ray).  Cowie analyzes the film's characters, themes, and styles, and, with his experience as a Bergman biographer, is able to attribute many of the film's elements to details in Bergman's own life.  The opening dream sequence, he says, shows Bergman's homage of German Expressionist films. And the character of Isak Borg is based not on Bergman's father as most would assume, but Bergman himself.  Cowie also includes observant remarks such as those regarding Bergman's comedic touches and loathing of action scenes.

The Blu-ray also retains the DVD's 90-minute interview of Bergman recorded for Swedish TV in 1998.  In the interview, the pensive 80-year-old director, like Isak Borg in his film, undergoes a profound self-examination of his own.  He speaks candidly about his strict upbringing as a child, says how he wishes he were not famous, recalls bitterly his being arrested (and later acquitted) for tax offenses in 1976, and grieves over his wife's death in 1995.

The Blu-ray offers some new extras as well.  There is a 4-minute ""introduction"" by Bergman, which is essentially an interview of the director done by Swedish documentarian Marie Nyrerd.  Bergman mainly talks about how he was able to get veteran actor Victor Sjstrm to appear in his film.  This piece seems to be an excerpt, or perhaps an outtake, from the 2004 documentary made by Nyrerd called ""Bergman Island"" (available as a Criterion DVD).

Another new extra on the Blu-ray is a 16-minute on-the-set footage of the shooting of ""Wild Strawberries"".  This 16mm footage was shot by Bergman himself, and so he does not appear in it.  Shot in both B&W and color, this piece is also accompanied by a nice audio commentary by the archival film curator at the Swedish Film Institute, Jan Wengstrom, who mentions the silent classic ""The Phantom Carriage"" several times and is obviously a big admirer of the film and its director, Victor Sjstrm, who plays the old man in ""Wild Strawberries"".  ""The Phantom Carriage"" is also available on Blu-ray and DVD from Criterion.

All extras on the ""Wild Strawberries"" Blu-ray are presented in upconverted 1080i.

P.S.  This is akin to a Bigfoot sighting: I discovered a subtitle typo on the ""Wild Strawberries"" Blu-ray.  After the brunch scene, one of Sara's dialogs reads, ""But sometimes it sees [sic] to me that I'm a lot older than Isak.""  That word should be ""seems"", not ""sees"".  The 2002 Criterion DVD shows it correctly.  This kind of error is quite uncharacteristic for Criterion, which has been in my belief the best publisher of movie discs for the past 30 years.",1370995200,17,5121,5.201219512195122
512066,5,6302783356,"One of my all time favorite films, Bergman uses flashbacks and dreams to sum up a life which, despite academic achievements, is fundamentally unsatisfying because of the character's failure to relate to others.

512070,4,6302783356,"Modern cinema rarely gives us a film as ambitious or thoughtful as Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries. It questions the very meaning of life, and the themes of religion, relationships, isolation, and death. This is made clear during the opening scene, which takes place before the credits. It's here that we meet the narrator and main character, Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjstrm). He's shown sitting at his desk, documenting the following thoughts:

""In our relations with other people, we mainly discuss and evaluate their character and behavior. That is why I have withdrawn from nearly all so-called relations. This has made my old age rather lonely.""

Think about the truth in those words. Whenever we meet anyone, we immediately evaluate them. Are they kind, intelligent, or attractive, and do we want to know them? How do you feel knowing that every person who interacts with you is judging you in some way? Many of us want to make a good impression and be liked, while others don't really care what other people think about their worth.

As the film unfolds, we learn that Borg is a doctor who is about to receive an honorary degree. He has a disturbing dream showing a clock with no hands, and a hearse containing his own corpse. After waking at 3am, he decides to drive to the ceremony early, ignoring the feelings of his housekeeper, who wants to leave at 9am as planned. Borg seems to care little for the feelings of those around him. His daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), accompanies him on the trip.

Borg's journey gives him the opportunity to talk to Marianne. He thinks that she dislikes or even hates him because of his indifferent attitude toward the feelings of other people. She even cites an example of such behavior, confirming his suspicions. But as the journey progresses, their conversation reveals things about the character of both people, and they realize that they do like things about each other.

You can see that Borg's musings at the beginning of the film were accurate. Every action he performs is judged. One brief meeting with a gas station attendant (von Sydow) also illustrates that point, but this time in a positive way. Some previous act of Borg's was remembered fondly by the attendant and his wife.

The film contains many dreams and memories, and it's easy to see why David Lynch would like Bergman's work. Borg takes Marianne to visit the house in which he spent the first twenty summers of his life, and we are shown Borg's nine siblings, and the woman he loved. I was reminded of the power of memory, and how it can be stimulated by revisiting places from our past. I am sure everyone can relate to that.

After this interlude, Borg meets three younger people who join him on his journey. Bergman uses the attitudes of these characters to show the contrasting outlooks of different age groups. We also meet two other strangers who are married, but appear to be unhappy. All of these interactions are there to show the possibilities that we have in our future. Will we be happy, lonely, or forced to compromise? Can damaged or broken relationships ever be healed? Why do we do what we do?

Wild Strawberries doesn't contain any profound revelations, but it certainly provokes thought. I mentioned that it's rare to see modern examples of films that explore such areas. A few examples are The Tree of Life, Everlasting Moments, Three Colors Red, and The Double Life of Veronique. If you enjoy exploring your own thoughts, and seeing how events shape our lives and actions, I would recommend all of those films. Wild Strawberries was made more than fifty years ago, and is still relevant today. It was Victor Sjstrm's last acting role, and he was very convincing as a 78-year-old man reflecting on his life.",1360454400,2,3762,4.812693498452012

512072,5,6302783356,"Bergman's Wild Strawberries (1957): This is one of the greatest examples of a film that sets the dream and/or memory world against the rational world. Many art films are about a man or a woman wandering away from the rational world for an extended period of time in order to inhabit and explore themselves in new ways, but this film is appealing and unique because it maintains a tight balance between the rational waking and irrational dream and memory worlds and explores the way these alternate worlds inform each other. Its very Freudian/Joycean in that the main character, Isak, an aging professor, learns about himself (why his life took the course it did, how he came to be his present self) through dreams and flashbacks and an ongoing dialogue with the self. Bergman's films are all about self-questioning (and Persona and Fanny and Alexander are his masterpieces) but this one is appealing for being about such a heavy matter but at the same time remaining so light. On this day, the professor has gained a new perspective and sense of humor about himself and life, and throughout the day he enjoys teasing and flirting and diverting himself with dreams and memories more than the professional honor he is receiving.

The other point - which could also be applied to 'The Seventh Seal' is
that the film seems less special today because the stylistic barriers

Wonderful performances, especially from the young Ingrid Thulin, as the doctor's daughter-in-law, at her most radiant.
Throughout the film, which is packed with symbolism, Bergman treads the fine line between dream and reality, poetry and prose,comedy and tragedy, memory and actuality with the utmost delicacy. This is the absolute antithesis of Hollywood. Nothing is for effect, yet everything is effective.

Whatever the cause, the characters and plot in this movie didn't seem believable to me, so I remained outside the movie, noticing the beauty of Ingrid Thulin more than anything else.  Regarding the main character, he especially didn't make sense to me and, to the extent that he did, I didn't like him at all.  He struck me as little more than a greedy and selfish old man.  Perhaps we could partly forgive his behavior because of the troubles in his life, but it's not clear that these weren't largely of his own making, and the end result was still a despicable person.

A sweet and interesting movie about an archaic curmudgeon who starts to reevaluate his life as it approaches its twilight, Wild Strawberries is a wonderful film from Bergman that zips through its short running time and develops a distinct and likable protagonist who we enjoy spending time with; neither as long as Fanny and Alexander, as cold as Cries and Whispers or as depressing as his ""silence of God"" trilogy, Wild Strawberries is a perfect gateway to Ingmar Bergman and a very appealing film.

As with a number of Bergman films (the notable exception being Persona), when I first watched Wild Strawberries, I wasn't actually all that impressed with it, save of course for the phenomenal acting. It took me months to fully digest it, to really understand what it is about this movie that makes so many people who know about these things (as well as the general public; as I write this, it is #130 on the IMDB Top 250 list) consider it one of the hundred (in many cases, ten or twenty) best films ever made. The key, when it came right down to it, was the kind of stupid oversight I make all the time; despite my love for Persona, I continue to think of Bergman as a realist instead of a magical realist. Once I threw the idea of realism out the window, Wild Strawberries suddenly made sense.

Isak Borg (the great Victor Sj&ouml;strom, as accomplished a director as he was an actor) is a professor travelling across Sweden to accept an award for distinguished service. With him is his estranged daughter-in-law, Marianne (Bergman regular Ingrid Thulin). As the journey progresses, Borg has encounters both in the world around him (including Bibi Andersson as a pretty hitchhiker) and inside his head, forcing him to look back and re-examine the coldness of his life. Eventually the line between reality and hallucination blurs to the point where we wonder if anything we have seen from the first frame is real.

It's a classic quest scenario done Bergman-style, which guarantees top-notch acting, camerwork, script, and everything else. All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the ride. **** ",1248739200,5,1640,4.784452296819788
512119,5,6302783356,"Drawing comparisons to (and probably serving as the inspiration for) Woody Allen's masterful `Deconstructing Harry', and personally reminding me of the shockingly haunting `Eraserhead', Ingmar Bergman's 1957 classic `Smultronstallet' (translated `Wild Strawberries') is truly an unforgettable film.  The definition of a reflection piece, `Smultronstallet' gives us a look into the life nearly complete and all the lessons learned from deep and meaningful pondering of that said life.

Isak Borg has been a doctor for fifty years.  He is being honored for this great achievement and so decides to take a road trip with his daughter-in-law to receive his award.  Upon setting off, Isak is plagued by memories that expose parts of his life that weighed the heaviest on him and that molded him into the cold and selfish man he is today.  This reflection helps Isak to see the meaning of his life and what he needs to do in order to truly feel accomplished.

A lot of people have spent time laying out the emotional progression of this film, and normally I would also, but I don't feel the need to just repeat everyone else.

I will mention that the wonderful thing about `Smultronstallet' is that its focus is on self reflection, and while that comes in the primary form of Dr. Isak Borg it is not exclusively contained in him.  Everyone around him is affected by his personal reflection and thus are all given the opportunity to expose themselves and work towards change.  We are also given modern day glimpses into Isak's past (with the surfacing of three young hitchhikers as well as a bickering married couple) that give Isak, as well as his daughter-in-law Marianne, reason to examine their own situation.  Their initial coldness is worn down as they realize they have more in common with one another than they expected.

The film is propelled by some very strong performances, especially from Victor Sjostrom and Ingrid Thulin.  Sjostrom, who was eighty when he did this film, is fully realized as Isak, capturing the man's emotional fragmentation as he picks apart his own existence.  Thulin is possibly even more effective as Marianne, for it is within her complete transformation (and stunning confession) that the true signs of change are seen.  The rest of the supporting cast is also very effective, especially Bibi Anderson (who covers two very important roles) as well as Bjorn Bjelfevstam and Naima Wifstrand; and Gertrud Fridh has a very strong cameo as Karin, Isak's wife.

The film is almost frighteningly realistic in its unveiling of our own humanity, and it is definitely a film that will leave you with much to ponder about your own life.  With some outstanding performances and Bergman's brilliantly restrained touch, `Smultronstallet' is a classic example at superior filmmaking.",1236902400,2,2799,5.065359477124183
512120,4,6302783356,"Of the three films of the late '50s with which Ingmar Bergman established his reputation as one of the foremost auteurs of the age, 1957's SMULTRONSTAELLET (Wild Strawberries) may be the weakest. Like DET SJUNDE INSEGLET (The Seventh Seal) and JUNGFRUKAELLAN (The Virgin Spring), it treats issues of religious faith and fear of death, but in a much less coherent way. Yet, SMULTRONSTAELLET may be the most charming and endearing of the trilogy, as we watch a crusty old man examine his past and decide to treat those around him better.

The Scrooge-like figure is Isak Borg (Viktor Sjostrom), a retired professor of medicine now in his 78th year. Invited from his Stockholm home to receive an honourary degree at Lund University, he decides to travel the distance by car. Accompanying him on this outing is his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who is experiencing marital troubles with his son Evald (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Along the way, Borg stops at some old stomping grounds, such as the summer house he spent his childhood at, and the area where he first practiced medicine. As Borg drifts into reveries of old memories, we discover how he became so bitter and hostile, but Marianne's incisive comments push him towards rediscovering his humanity.

Of course death is an ever-present spectre when Borg is pushing 80. But the strong religious element comes when Borg and Marianne pick up three hitchhikers, a young lady (Bibi Andersson) with her boyfriend and a family-appointed chaperone. One of these lads wants to be a priest and has strong faith, while the other is hoping to become a doctor and doubts the existence of a god. They quarrel, but somehow this entire matter seems unrelated to the main arc of the film. Similarly baffling is Evald's babblings about how he doesn't want a child because he himself does not want to exist, in which the writing almost seems parody Bergman.

The acting, however, is superb. Sjostrom really brings his character to life with his initial bah-humbug mannerisms and his later senile puzzlement that he cannot win everyone back to him right away. It's amusing to see Bibi Andersson playing a ditzy teenager, a role light years away from her intense turn in Bergman's PERSONA almost a decade later.

As elitist as I'm in danger of sounding for writing that, I do believe it, but I will also concede that I am by no means experienced enough in life to appreciate Wild Strawberries fully.  It makes me wonder why a film like Wild Strawberries would be shown in film classes to budding and perhaps talented artists, but not unlike me, they are most likely novices at life.  Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sjstrm) is not a novice.  He knows what it is like to lose love and surrender to something less.  He knows exactly what it is like to be lulled and deceived by life's trials.  For so long he was dead in life and would become alive again during the process of his death. It is a bittersweet and profoundly beautiful realization that Dr. Borg is compelled to find in this truly amazing film.

Wild Strawberries follows the one day journey of 76 year old medical scientist Isak Borg.  Isak was born into a family of ten children and he is the only one alive today.  He has been a doctor for fifty years, a father for probably more than thirty years, a widower for some time, and socially he has withdrawn quite a bit.  He is being rewarded for his professional accomplishments and he travels to his destination to receive his honors.  Through interactions with various characters, through triggered memories, and sometimes through horrific dream sequences, this film turns out to be a meditation on Dr. Borg's life.  It is ultimately about a man in the twilight of his life gazing into the mirror, perhaps for the final time, to find some level of resolution and comfort.

There are so few filmmakers today making existential road films like this.  Alfonso Cuarn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Y-tu-mam-tambin/dp/B00005JL57/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Y tu mam tambin</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>) comes to mind.  It's so rare to find something so deep and succinct.  Most films that rely to any degree of making philosophical statements through dream sequences and similar devices are often reduced to being vague, cryptic, and sometimes even pretentious.  Wild Strawberries provides both a glimpse into the psychology of Dr. Borg as well as a more macrocosmic spirituality some viewers will empathize with and find endlessly rewarding.  It is a film about nerves and dread but at the same time it is a film about authentic self-identity, satisfaction, and peace.  There's a lot to learn here.  This is a film to enjoy multiple times for sure.",1222646400,3,3011,5.753950338600451
512122,4,6302783356,"Watching Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries for the first time was an interesting experience because of three reasons. One, the film itself is terrific. Two, I watched it the same night as the 2006 Academy Awards, and was struck by how Bergman's film never condescends to its viewer, unlike the major nominated Politically Correct films Hollywood churns out and rewards. Three, having always known of Bergman from the films of American filmmaker Woody Allen, I was struck at just how much Allen steals from Bergman in many of his films- from camera angles and techniques, to outright theft of scenes. Not that I am accusing Allen of wrongdoing, for T.S. Eliot basically admitted that if an artist is to steal, they should steal from the greats, and Bergman crafted a great film, rife for purloining, back in 1957.
  The story the film tells is rather simple- it's a road film that journeys into the past and psyche of a retired widower and Professor of Medicine named Isak Borg (Victor Sjstrm). Sjstrm was apparently a greatly influential actor and director in the first few decades of Swedish cinema, but by 1957 had spent a decade or more in declining reputation. This film and role sealed his immortality. It is a great performance, and one which a lesser actor could easily have gone over the top with. There is a perfect modulation to not only his performance, but to every aspect of the film, starting with Bergman's stellar screenplay. I would be hard pressed to think of a great film, or even a good one, that lacks a good screenplay. This is one of the ironies of film, versus the other visual arts- it's almost wholly dependent upon an art form, writing, with an entirely different paradigm.
  Bergman was wise to have his film clock in at a mere hour and a half. It is a small, personal film, despite its cosmic undertones and themes. In a sense it balances the best of the dramas of Shakespeare and Chekhov, which is where the plays of Ibsen and Strindberg, Bergman's two greatest claimed influences, reside. He also wisely fills the detritus of Borg's life with symbolism that others- in the film or out- can interpret, but to Borg are just there. In a sense, the most important scene in the film, the one which acts as a fractal refraction of the whole film, is that where Borg and his mother pick through the old box of children's things as Marianne looks coldly on, misinterpreting both mother and son for her own reasons. For this reason, Wild Strawberries stands out not only as a great piece of cinema, but its screenplay as a great piece of literature. And given the multivalence of such art as this, to skillfully combine great imagery with great storytelling in a poetic vein, it's no wonder that film has become the dominant art form of the last half century, supplanting the novel and painting, just as they had supplanted poetry and the romance.
  Let me end this essay where I began, lamenting the greatness of this film juxtaposed with the supposedly `great' films that Hollywood proffered for Oscars this year. It is like comparing a rich, diverse banquet with a greasy bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Period. One of the complaints that I have always found valid about great art is how it is usually always too expensive for the average person to enjoy- be it paintings in swank galleries, small books of poetry several times the price of novels, outrageously priced theater and opera tickets, or even foreign films on video or DVD. This was one of the major reasons it took me so long to watch this film, because the DVD I purchased, from The Criterion Collection, retails for $39.95, while your average Hollywood blockbuster can retail for a third that, or less. Is it any wonder, then, that the masses choose swill to fill their free time? In the name of raising up the filmic awareness and appreciation for the great films of the past, foreign or domestic, like Wild Strawberries, I urge companies that distribute foreign films to do their best to make good quality DVDs of such classics available more cheaply, for there is a market to be filled with great affordable art, and once a taste of greatness is given, the market will only expand, and justify the demotic impulse to lower prices with an increased quantity of sales making up for loss of high profit margins per unit. Dover Thrift Editions in America, and Wordsworth Editions in the U.K. have proven that great books cheaply distributed is an economically viable strategy, and I believe the same is true for great films. Why should films like Wild Strawberries remain only in the province of film snobs, and not made available to compete for viewership with contemporary schlock like Brokeback Mountain or Crash simply for economic reasons? Greatness in art may exact a price from its creators, but price should not diminish art's reach. Great films like Wild Strawberries deserve to be freed to the masses, to be enjoyed and enlightened.

512124,4,6302783356,"So says Professor Isak* Borg (Victor Sjostrom), the protagonist in ""Wild Strawberries,"" who's been having some frightening dreams that call into question his whole life.  Beginning with the famous opening scene of Borg's nightmare of loneliness, isolation, and death, the film moves us between past and present with a series of day dreams and sleep dreams, some of them pleasant memories, some of them bitter memories, some of them forboding nightmares that speak to the aging Borg's anxiety that his life has somehow gone wrong.

The film is wonderfully conceived:  a one-day car journey symbolizing Borg's life journey; Borg's ""dream"" encounter with the past, especially his memories of his cousin Sara, symbolized by his present encounter with youth in the form of the hitchhiker Sara (both roles cleverly played by Bibi Anderesson); the continuity of coldness between generations, from mmother to son to grandson; Borg's daughter-in-law Marianne's decision that the child in her womb will break the pattern of alienation characteristic of the Borgs; the nonsexual intimacy between Professor Borg and his housemaid that Borg never found with his wife.  Past merges into present, the future seems now (hitchhiker Sara; Marianne's pregnancy), and the message is one of great hope.  Even a life that's gone wrong can be redeemed.

The performances are stellar.  Ingrid Thulin is superb as the wounded but strong Marianne (she's also stunningly beautiful).  Bibi Andersson is perfect as the spunky teenager Sara (present-day).  Max von Sydow, although he has only a walk-on role, is touching and convincing.  Even Gunnar Bjornstrand, an incredibly wooden actor in every performance I've ever seen, is good here--precisely because his role calls for a wooden, emotionally shutdown man.  And Victor Sjostrom is simply magnificent, capturing with heartbreaking realism the nostalgia and regrets, but also dignity and wisdom, of old age.

So why do I give the film only 4 stars?  I just don't think the dream sequences work all that well.  As in the overture to ""Persona,"" they strike me as overdone and sometimes heavy-handed, particularly the opening nightmare and the latter examination dream.  I could forgive this.  But what I found almost unbearable was the mawkishness of the summer house scenes, where everyone is happy and wholesome, somewhat reminiscent of the syrupy ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Perhaps Bergman intended them as such--a kind of parody of middle-class, late nineteenth- century contentment.  But I don't think so.  That interpretation really does seem forced.  So the only conclusion to be drawn is that Bergman meant them as genuinely happy memories, and they come off as grindingly pollyanna-like.

So ""Wild Strawberries"" isn't one of my favorite Bergman films.  But it's a great one nonetheless.

512135,5,6302783356,"In 1975 my literature professor told us we were going to study the greatest movie ever made and it was about an old man driving an old car to receive an award for being a good doctor.  Plus, instead of Technicolor, it was in black & white.  On top of that, the film was in Swedish and I would have to read the English subtitles.  But never fear, with the promise of such an exhilarating, action-packed movie, he planned on showing it twice in a row, and wagered all who attended the first screening would stay for the second.  And he nailed it.

We began by reading the stage play, which is the same as the screenplay. Then we had a chance to see the film. I indeed watched both showings and it changed my thinking about what makes a good ""film"" (this was way too highbrow for my young self to call a movie, but now I think ""movie"" is the right word, because the action, plot and production are all so powerful, against all odds!  This movie is a blockbuster!)

At the time I was a wild boy about campus who's taste for movies was more action/adventure, western and mystery/suspense. The funny thing about Wild Strawberries is there's a little of all those genre's in it (if you understand what a cowboy Bergman was at this point in his career).

This is the story about the late-life introspection of an elderly physician. It really appears on the surface to be about as dull a concept for a film as one could ever want to suffer through. But this is a story about facing reality, and reality is rarely dull. The plot moves seamlessly through many phases, but much of it involves a road trip through the Swedish countryside.

A few years ago I bought a DVD of the 70's cult car-chase flick ""Vanishing Point""; I hadn't seen it since the drive-in in my college years. I also own a Criterion Collection copy of Wild Strawberries and I've watched both recently. I realized that Wild Strawberries is a car chase flick as well.

But Bergman's Isak (played by Victor Sjstrm) is not running from war weariness but from a life of nihilism cloaked in the old-world respectability of a family doctor. The chase is his lifetime of self-certainty, agnosticism and increasing isolation finally catching up to him. He realizes that he has been a walking dead man for much of his life (something he partially inherited from his mother, and impacted all his close associations throughout his long and successful, but sad life). Getting too far into the details may yield spoilers, although there is enough complexity in this plot to keep literature classes struggling for an A for a long time.

The plot is a series of amazing dialogue scenes, with interruptions for disturbing dream sequences, most from his classic 1937 Packard Eight Touring limousine.  The day's accumulation of insights, linking dreams, reverie and conversation gradually lead to a turning point, a crisis precipitated by unyielding reality checks that befuddle the normally unflappable Dr. Borg.

The ground-breaking dream sequences, the first early in the film, are Hitchcock-like and terrifyingly surreal (or was the early Hitch being Bergmanesque?).  The dreams set the tone of tension in a film that could have so easily been a drone, but not with Bergman in charge. Of incredible beauty is the reverie scene, where Isak relives some of his childhood while making a stop at his family's deserted summer lake house.

The continuing, front-seat of the Packard dialog scenes between Isak and his daughter-in-law, and later with the Almans (including another disturbing dream sequence) and with the ""children"" (hitchhiking college-age kids) are all filled with symbols and conversation pointing to Isak's living-dead existence.  As the day progresses, they chip away at Borg's long-held control, coldness and distance.

It's interesting that Bergman himself, at this point in his young career, was much like Isak; agnostic, distant, self-absorbed, incapable of intimacy. Yet his conclusion to Wild Strawberries is much more hopeful than Bergman's own life.  One wonders if Bergman may have ended his life with a Wild Strawberries conversion, or if he considered it at the end.

The turning point of the movie, easy to miss if you're not paying close attention, is the love-promise from the young hitchhiker Sara (Bibi Andersson). This is the sea-change moment for Isak. The incredible sweetness and innocent passion, freely offered in grace by the beautiful young girl, serves as a regeneration moment, a freely-given justification of Isak, imputing her child-like passion and righteousness into his heart. In a way it was as though his childhood sweetheart (also named Sara, also played by Bibi) came back in her youthful beauty to heal the wound of rejection she inflicted on Isak almost 70 years earlier.

The first Sara's betrayal of young Isak (seen in the summer reverie scene), choosing his brother as the better lover and husband, probably led to Isak's walled-off life.  But when this new Sara promises her Platonic, childlike love to the old Isak, he replies with solemn acceptance:  ""I'll remember that"".  This seems to break the spell of living death dealt to him by his first love, and exacerbated by so many others in his life.

Unlike Bergman, Isak closes his eyes that night with the hope of a life of meaning, of love in service, not just service as a foil for maintaining personal dignity and image. He sees that loving for loves sake is worth the risk of pain.  Unlike Bergman, Isak has a hope of seeing God when his death does arrive, and has demonstrated a new life has begun. This is Isak's Today; his day of repentance, of stopping the tortuous task of hardening his heart against the call of life, yielding in submission to love, mercy and grace.

This film requires many viewings, and I have yet to tire of it.  Bergman's troupe of actors were on par with the best of any generation, his cinematography is spartan and overwhelmingly effective; his location shooting in the beautiful Swedish summer is fascinatingly appealing, yielding a foreign, forgotten land yet with a ""down-home"" feeling that's almost Mayberry-like, if that's not too extreme a comparison.

This movie shows the dichotomy of living for self versus living in loving service to and with others. Isak thought he lived to serve but discovered that service is only of meaning to the server if it is from the heart. Service without love is only partial service to those in need, and is a self-inflicted affront to the server.  This is ultimately a hopeful picture that we can all learn from if we watch with an open heart. Otherwise, we see the wasted tragedy of existential living with no greater good than one's own dead image.

The opening dream sequence is very disturbing. Its quite probable that this was influenced by certain modern/surreal artists. I'd also suggest that this scene was, if only indirectly, an influence on certain later horror films. The photography and camerawork is marvellous.

The remainder of the film (about another 80mins) is a largely somber look at lonliness as seen through the Professors eyes. Despite some previous reviewers comments that they found this an uplifting film I would advise caution. Yes there are a few uplifting moments, but in general this is a frankly depressing film, as the Professor, although a hugely respected man, seems to have no friends, and has upset various members of his family.

I've only watched it once and will certainly watch it again. Then it may get 5 stars as it is undoubtably a classic movie which will repay repeated viewings. Just be aware that you may finish watching it and feel quite depressed.",1215561600,,1282,4.818181818181818

512138,4,6302783356,"This was my first Ingmar Bergman movie, and let's just say I was very impressed.  While several reviewers have correctly noted that ""Wild Strawberries"" is full of symbolism (some of it hazy) and somewhat slow-moving, it is anything but plodding or dull.  Rather, the film is pretty accessible to just about any audience, even a non-Swedish one, as it beautifully examines personal issues that will ultimately effect all of us: aging, regret, bitterness, and redemption.  While I am completely unfamiliar with his work, I read that the star, Victor Sjosstrom was one of Sweden's finest actors in the early 20th Century.  This is not surprising, for as the central character, Dr. Isak Borg, he carries both the film and emotional weight of his character with each utterance, grimace, and movement throughout the movie.  As the movie progresses, I felt a host of emotions -- some negative, some positive -- for Dr. Borg as he evolved from an angry old man into a warm being that can accept his disappointments and is able to move on without any lingering bitterness.

Since several of the reviewers have already provided good summaries of the plot, I'll skip providing those details and instead focus on a small handful of the great scenes in the movie which really stuck with me.  First, the dream sequences.  A couple of Dr. Borg's dreams are tremendously eerie and piercing.  The first one of note, which numerous other reviews have commenting on, appears at the very beginning, with Dr. Borg waking along completely empty streets until a carriage carrying his coffin goes by.  When the carriage gets its wheel caught on a lamp-post, a creepy creaking noise emanates until the carriage breaks free and the coffin spills onto the street in front of Borg.  After dead Borg's hand comes out and grabs the living Dr. Borg, I was awe-struck.  Great scene, and of the better nightmare sequences you'll ever see in cinema.

Similarly, the dream where old Dr. Borg is sitting with young Sara, the love of life and his young fiance, is superb and shattering.  It is very difficult not to feel empathy for Borg as Sara coldly tells him that she is going to marry his brother Siegfried, and then forces him to stare at his old face in a mirror before abruptly running off.  Another wrenching, powerful scene.

I think, though, that the last five minutes of ""Wild Strawberries"" may be the best, most satifying part of the film.  It is at the end that Dr. Borg finally realizes redemption for his life and disappointments, and is able to bask in the love of those who mattered most to him: Sara, his daughter-in-law Marianne, and the son whom he imparted his coldness to.  When present-day Sara tells him he is the one she always loved, and he is able to lie in the warmth of pleasant dreams of his childhood, the journey ends for Borg and the viewer.  This ending is exceptionally gratifying.  While I am sure that Bergman's symbolism can be interpreted in a plethora of intelligent ways, the film struck me as kind of dark cinema, but with a moral that anyone can overcome their regrets and disappointments at any time, even at the very end of their life.

Though not intertwined with reality as in his later films but rather clearly separated from the flow as Borg's dreams, those scenes are terrific and must be very unusual at the time. Ingrid Thulin's calm beauty compliments her excellent performance greatly. There are a few minor but irritating details one cannot miss, particularly, the highway accident with the car hurling into a ditch as a football and its passengers getting out with a smile and without a scratch, and Sara and the boys. While Bibi Andersson looks just a bit older than the 17-year-old character she plays, the boys long forgot when they were that age, now both of mature complexion and well-shaven.

When the film ended and the lights went up, I remember the silence. Except for a few people fighting back sobs, you could hear a pin drop. This film had hit a bunch of college kids that hard. Today, one can see it again and learn so much. Back then, I remember having only one thought--when I die, will their be anyone there to say that they like me? For anyone intimidated by Bergman, don't worry. Yes, many deep and important layers of art and philosophy can be explored in his movies. But just as often, a crazy, emotional, heartfelt explosion will go off in your head while you watch his movies.

I have only seen the movie once, but I know it is one I will watch many times at different points in my life. The film is a masterpiece of reflection, memory and nostalgia. Bergman's directorship is sublime, as the elderly Isak Borg encounters dreams, nightmares as he travels to be honoured for his work as a doctor, but faces to the inner turmoil of his consciousness. It is the best portrait of what it must be like for a reflective, elderly man to be nearing the end of his days I have ever seen on screen. The set pieces - the childhood reprises, the rowing couple in the car accident, the bohemian, vibrant menange a trois with Sara, her fiance and escort (or other lover?) - accumulate to create a compelling, moving and tense tapestry. And the women (especially the wistful Marianne, who accompanies her uncle Isak for his journey, and suffers from her own marital problems with her angst bedevilled husband) are amongst the most beautiful in all cinema.

Wild Strawberries was my first Bergman film. But I know I have had the rare experience of discovering an artist whose work I know will compel me for years to come. Thankfully, there are many more jewels in the Bergman canon to appreciate.",1185667200,3,1290,4.633187772925764
512143,5,6302783356,"For most college-age students the Bergman film that seems to work best is ""The Seventh Seal,"" even though ""Wild Strawberries"" is a similar story. The ""plague"" that Isaak Borg confronts isn't bubonic but old age and death, and his trip to the University to receive a medal is as pointless as the knight's trip to Elsinore to escape the plague.  The journey that matters in both stories is the inner quest for meaning and purpose in a life that, in Isaak Borg's case, has produced a cold, judgmental, alienated old man. But in this film Bergman moves from theological questioning and the meanings of suffering and faith to the interior realm of time and memory and their relation to understandings of the self.  Borg's journey allows him to see, first, that he has come up short and that there are serious questions to be asked about the way he has conducted his personal life; and, second, that even at the age of 80 he has been granted the opportunity to ""re-vision"" his past life, to affect people in the present, and to change. Few moments in cinema are as satisfying as the final shot of Borg falling asleep, a slight smile on his face, as he arrives at a peaceful moment of understanding and acceptance. At the beginning of the film, he awakens from a nightmare in which there are clocks without hands; at the end, he is back in time, reconciled with his past and with those who matter in his life. It's a moment of powerful atonement and redemption, optimistic but not implausibly so.

""Wild Strawberries"" makes up for John Huston's evocative but ultimately unsuccessful filming of James Joyce's ""The Dead."" The director catches some of Joyce's elegiac poetry but fails to capture the character of Gabriel Conroy. In one of the more powerful epiphanies in all literature, Gabriel sees, for the first time, his wife--as a lover but of a dead man rather than himself--and the gulf the separates them. His redemption, like Borg's, occurs almost at the last instant. No longer a superior, learned and arrogant being cut off from the relatives he has just patronized, his atonement, like Borg's, comes as he is rejoined to loves past and present, to both the living and the dead. Borg's moment of grace comes in the form of wild strawberries; Gabriel's, falling snow.",1185494400,3,2267,4.734177215189874

Borg has isolated virtually everyone around him with his cold, unfeeling attitude toward humankind.  This is set to be turned on its head, in just a day's time, as the old man goes on something of a journey through the course of his life, by way of a series of flashbacks, on his way to town to receive his honor.  In fact, they are more a series of ""what if"" scenarios than what actually occurred in his childhood, but they are both highly philosophical and rattle the man to his core.  What has he been doing all his life?  Will he continue his mindset up until his final breath?

Yes, I realize I paint a very stark picture of this film.  In many respects, that is not an [entirely] accurate depiction of the tone of this story.  There are great, humorous moments here.

512187,5,6302783356,"I first saw ""Wild Strawberries"" many years ago at one of the special screenings in the small theater in Moscow. It was the first Bergman's film I ever saw. This picture is amazing in its emotional impact and in my opinion is one of Bergman's most optimistic, profound, and warm films.

""Wild Strawberries"" provides sincere, intelligent, and emotional contemplations of life's disappointment, regrets, and losses. The main character, seventy-eight-year-old Professor Isak Borg is forced to see his life in a true and painful light, but he also would learn that there is hope.

Sparkling cinematography by Gunnar Fisher and superb acting of Bergman's regulars - Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Anderson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Max von Sydow and especially, the great silent film director, Victor Sjostrom as Professor Borg add to many delights of ""Wild Strawberries"" which also include Bergman's writing/directing with his famous mixing of conscious and unconscious, dreams and reality, the past and the present in the same scene.

That was something else I realized while watching ""Wild Strawberries"" - how close Bergman and another favorite director of mine, Andrei Tarkovsky were. I knew that Tarkovsky had called himself Bergman's student, and both of them had great respect for each other's work and talent, but it was during that first watching of ""Wild Strawberries"", I knew where Tarkovsky looked when he was creating his own masterpiece, ""Zerkalo"" or ""The Mirror"" (1975)",1175904000,4,1462,5.3478260869565215
512188,5,6302783356,"Others have described Wild Strawberries in great detail here, so I won't rehash. What I will say that this is a first-rate film filled with philosophy and symbolism. To me, it is not only the story of a man's physical journey to receive the accolades of this world, but also an emotional journey that illuminates for the lead character the human qualities and relationships that in the end are the most important part of life. For what is a man who is blessed with material wealth yet has no friends?

Viktor Sjostrom, as Prof. Isak Borg gradually undergoes an emotional renaissance with the help of his daughter-in-law and kind strangers. We see him at the end bringing along his equally cold son and recalcitrant daughter-in-law, finally breaking the chain of generations of emotional rigidity that characterized the Borg men.

The film is often surrealistic, the dream sequences stunning in their clarity. And Wild Strawberries is not without its comic moments. But, it is not a film for those who want action. Ingmar Bergman has made here a thinking person's film, and if you are one of intellectual bent who enjoys mulling the vagaries of our existence, then this bittersweet journey is one you should take.",1171756800,3,1212,4.907317073170732

512193,4,6302783356,"Ingmar Bergman's 1957 ""Wild Strawberries"" is a classic story of lost love, redemption, forgiveness, life, death and acceptance. While this film is in no way groundbreaking in its storyline, one of the greatest things about it is the ever present Bergman-techniques found throughout the film.

From the expert use of highly skilled cinematographic techniques, Bergman fans would immediately fall in love with this piece. Bergman knows just when to ""black out"" background sequences for emotional impact and when to execute such things as long takes and close-ups. Bergman's use of ""shadow-play"" techniques is present in ""Wild Strawberries"" and yet somewhat diluted in comparison with some of his other works (namely ""Persona,"" and ""The Seventh Seal"").

It should be noted that unlike some other known works by Bergman, this film is more or less philosophy-light. That doesn't necessarily mean it's devoid of philosophical content though. Religious and quasi-moral influences can be found within the film in the form of dialogue between characters as well as implied symbols throughout the film (this is present in the idea of wild strawberries and such things as dreams that portray an impending death arriving closer and closer).

What this film does offer is a slightly more in-depth look at the theme of redemption on the death bed as far as character psychology is concerned. The portrayal of human psychology in terms of regret, remorse, and acceptance are superb in the film. This film is, for all intents and purposes, a film everyone can understand and enjoy (hence the Oscar nominations).

Unfortunately the aforementioned theme has been the topic of much interest in movies before and certainly after ""Wild Strawberries."" One would certainly expect more of an artistic quality to this film in the way of more abstract representational imagery (a style that Bergman is famous for as well). Because ""Wild Strawberries"" lacked this aspect, the film doesn't really separate itself from similarly themed releases which are far more interesting to watch.

For the reasons mentioned I'm inclined to give this film a 3.5 or 4 (typically Bergman's pictures score 4s and 5s with me). Swedish cinema enthusiasts and Bergman fans aside, I'm having an extremely difficult time recommending this film for casual viewing purposes. The film and acting overall was great but it just doesn't have the staying power it did in the ""art houses"" of the 50s and 60s.",1148601600,2,2451,5.19493670886076
512194,5,6302783356,"""Wild Strawberries"" is perhaps Ingmar Bergman's warmest and most accessible film to understand. Certainly for those uninitiated to Bergman it would be the first of his films to watch.

The plot is rather simple, but by no means is it a simplistic story. What seems to be a series of ordinary events in a day actually gives the ageing Professor Dr. Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) time to reflect on his life. The dreams he summons up, the  journey he takes to a university to receive an academic honour and the people he meets along the way, all serve to summarise key moments in his life and to define his personhood.

Interestingly, Bergman only shows us the kindly, old-world demeanour of Professor Borg. He allows us to see how Professor Borg perceives himself to be to others. His reflections of family and their happy moments at the summerhouse paint him in a gentle light. The dalliances of his betrothed cousin Sara (Bibi Andersson) with his brother  while collecting wild strawberries shows his plighted innocence and vulnerability. When he interacts with the young travellers who have hitched a ride, he is the jovial old uncle. Even his rapport with his housekeeper Mrs Alman(Gunnel Brostrom) suggests flirtatiousness.

However, the people close to him insinuate the opposite. In their eyes he is aloof, insensitive and self-centred. His daughter-in-law Marianne(Ingrid Thulin) tells how coldly he reacted to her request for shelter after leaving her husband Evald (Gunnar Bjornstrand). She even states at one point that his son Evald's indifference mirrors his own temperament. The housekeeper, while  caring is cantankerous, inferring that he has been equally crabby towards her in over 40 years of service to him. And lastly, his 95-year old mother is cold and rigid, suggesting the cause for his disposition.

Or, could it perhaps be that Bergman wants us to think the old professor is turning over a new leaf? The Dali-esque dream he has at the start of the day is certainly sobering. He wanders an empty street amid shop houses. He sees a handless street clock and pocket watch (which is seen in reality when he visits his mother much later). As he walks along the sidewalk, a horse-drawn hurst pulls up, knocking a lamppost, careening to and fro, screeching like a baby and symbolising the similarity of birth and death. A wheel breaks free and a casket slides onto the street. He approaches the casket. He sees a hand slither forth and grasp his own, pulling him face to face with the corpse of himself. Obviously, it is an unsettling nightmare to him.

So too is the dream Bergman introduces near the end of the professor's trip. In it, the professor is judged by one of his peers (actually the husband of a bickering couple met earlier in his drive). He is presented a couple of episodes from his past. He relives the amorous tryst of Sara and his brother he witnessed in his youth. He then undergoes a mock medical exam of absurd questions from an examiner. In one sense it is his day of reckoning; in another sense, it is Bergman putting the professor's personality under the microscope and allowing us to see his troubled life.

To add sympathy for the professor, the camerawork of Sven Nykvist is brilliant as usual. In the final scene when the camera lens focuses on the smiling face of Professor Borg while sleeping, Bergman lets the lighting and expression radiate such warmth and contentment that the old man immediately captivates our heart.

And that is precisely the effect Bergman had in mind. He once commented that some moviegoers had just viewed ""Wild Strawberries"" and were so touched they subsequently visited their elderly relatives the following day. To Bergman, it was the perfect compliment. Hopefully after watching it, we too walk will away sufficiently impressed to feel more empathy and respect for the aged. For it is truly a beautiful, beautiful film!",1147737600,3,3895,4.896813353566009
512205,5,6302783356,"Wild Strawberries was shot in 1957, a time when Bergman was enjoying worldwide fame but going through a rough personal patch.  His efforts to work through the preoccupations of that troubled period led to one his most emotionally coherent and best-loved films.

Bergman wanted to recapture the feeling of his childhood as an adult - to see if he could literally walk back into his past.  He was also trying to get a grip on the emotional dynamic between himself and his estranged father.  The character through whom Bergman brings these longings to the screen is Isak Borg, an elderly doctor and professor of medicine.  Over the course of a long day, Isak journeys from Stockholm to Lund, in southern Sweden, to receive an honorary doctorate.  Along the way, he detours into memories and old desires.

The movie opens with a dream sequence.  Isak is wandering through deserted streets filled with lurid light.  The clock faces have no hands, nor does his watch; he's outside of time. A horse-drawn hearse catches its wheel on a lamppost, and a coffin spills off the back and pops open.  Isak reaches for the body and sees that he's tugging at his own cadaver.  This scene foreshadows many other moments in the film where the old man will be a physical presence on stage sets built in his own mind.

Isak stops at the cottage where his family spent summers during his youth.  As he stares at the house, he drifts back half a century, when he was in love with his cousin Sara, and hoped to marry her.  Hidden in the trees, he watches Sara cavort with his older brother.  Later in the same fantasy, the old man wanders into the house and hears Sara say that she really admires Isak, but finds him almost too high-minded.  We learn later that Sara married his earthier, more passionate brother.  In another dream sequence, the woman he eventually married complains to a lover that she suffers under Isak's emotional distance.  Isak's not an unfeeling man, but somehow he became a cold man; through his dreams and reveries he's trying to work out how he turned onto the road that led him to so many emotional dead ends.

The issues from Isak's past tumble into the present.  He's accompanied on his journey by Mariana, the wife of Isak's only son, Evald.  As they drive south, Mariana tells him that Evald is trudging into the same emotionally barren territory where Isak ended up.  By the time he arrives in Lund to receive his degree, Isak understands that professional competence hasn't compensated for the sins of omission and commission in his emotional life.  As Sara says to him in another dream sequence, ""You know so much, and yet you know nothing.""

As Isak, veteran film director/actor Viktor Sjostrom steals the movie.  Bergman's camera devours his face, and Sjostrom delivers a lifetime's worth of fears, longings, and regets, often with no more than the merest shift of an eyebrow.  It's a bravura performance.  Otherwise, Bergman is working here with his usual troupe of stage and film actors, and they are uniformly excellent. Ingrid Thulin makes Mariana's shift from wariness of Isak to fondness for him completely convincing.  Bibi Andersson plays the Sara of Isak's boyhood as well as a hitchhiking gamine (also named Sara) with her usual warm intelligence.  We even get a cameo by Max Von Sydow as a gas station attendant.  This is pre Sven Nykvist, but the black and white cinematography uses a full expressionist palette.

Wild Strawberries continues Bergman's lifelong argument between his head and his heart. He understands that most humans can't survive for long in the alpine zone of abstract intelligence.  But once you descend to the realm of human interaction, you're plunged into impossible conundrums over mortality, identity and making relationships work.  Isak realizes that he needs the heat that comes from rubbing up against other people.  The price of human warmth is accepting that the human condition can't be cured by isolating yourself from contaminating contacts.  It's a price he's ready to pay, and he proves it by reaching out to his son and to Mariana.

By the end of the movie, Isak has fought his demons to a draw.  Tucked in bed after his long journey, his memories comfort rather than claw at him.  He can rest easier now.  Bergman has spared us nothing of life's hardships and disappointments, but the old man's journey toward acceptance and fellow feeling is exalting rather than depressing.  This is artistry of the highest order.",1141171200,2,4478,4.83311432325887
512206,5,6302783356,"Seventy-eight-year-old Professor Isak Borg (played brilliantly by Victor Sjostrom) is on his way to Lund from Stockholm with his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin) to receive an honorary doctorate degree; more importantly, along the journey he will get back his humanity and peace of mind.

The trip he takes is a journey back in time, but only in a psychological sense (he remains a 78-year-old man throughout the movie). Borg is a cold, uncompromising, irrascible man. He experiences a number of dreams - of his childhood home; of being rejected by his sweetheart Sara (Bibi Andersson) for his brother; of his mother, who is as cold and death-like as he; and of his dead wife who is unsatisfied with the cold professor. Through these dream visions he gains insight into himself and by the end of the movie is making good on them, beginning with Marianne.

The most famous dream sequence occurs with Borg walking through an empty cityscape and includes encounters with a faceless man (representing himself), a handless clock (""timeless"" death), and a funeral wagon that seems to beckon him to get in. At first Borg is frightened by the dreams, but then experiences calm as he understands what they mean about himself. The final dream is one of peacefulness.

Bergman's artistic vision is powerful and brilliant. The choice of Sjostrom, one of the creators of Swedish cinema in the 1920s, as the main character is a masterful stroke, and is Bergman's salute to the Swedish film industry. Once viewed, movies like this, with their potent images and sublime messages, are hard to forget.",1136505600,3,1591,4.996226415094339
512207,2,6302783356,"Is there anyone more pretentious than this guy? Oh yeah, Wim Wenders comes to mind.

Bergman's  characters are (very often) in some kind of emotional/mental turmoil.

Stuff is painful to sit through (due to the way it is always presented.)

Have looked at about a dozen  Bergman films over the years. You can feel the guy working way too hard to say something profound, to be profound...and basically stumbles around and bores the viewer to death.

Film directors, like the aforementioned, seem to lack the ability to get down to business: get the point across, and move on. Keep it simple, as the late, great Charles Bukowski often said.

But nope, not with these guys. Why? Because they want YOU TO KNOW YOU ARE NOT JUST WATCHING ANOTHER FILM, YOU ARE EXPERIENCING  ""ART.""

Yeah. Right. Art to you, but agony for us to sit through.

Akira Kurosawa's films don't usually move at a fast clip the way the slick and idiotic/bloated Hollywood mega-budgeted flicks do, but with Kurosawa you are unable to take your eyes away from the screen. Why? Because there is always something interesting going on, and because he knew the last thing he wanted  was bore the viewer  to distraction. Also: It's a thing called true genius. Kurosawa had it to spare.",1135123200,10,1246,4.744186046511628
512208,5,6302783356,"""Wild Strawberries"" is considered one of Ingmar Bergman's best movies and that, in itself, is quite a recommendation.  Still, there are some art films that are more art than film and many of us go away from one of those wondering ""What the heck was that all about"".  This, however, is a film that has a story to tell in a serenely subtle way.  The main character is Professor Borg who is a man of some modest reputation about to be honored with a special award.  He decides to journey to the site of his award presentation by car.  It is a good 10-12 hour journey and with him he takes his daughter in law.  They don't particularly like each other but are willing to at least discuss this fact.  Along the way they pick up, and sometimes discharge, other passengers in their spacious touring car.  Also along the way they make several stops at places that generate memories in Professor Borg.  At times while he naps his dreams give us other insights.  It is through these dreams and recollections that the professor comes to understand much about life.  The movie ends with our understanding the changes in Professor Borg.  He is no longer the self-centered, argumentative man who is set in his ways.  He now finds himself sincerely solicitous of others, concerned about the welfare of his son and daughter-in-law and their relationship.  Though elderly, we see a man who has discovered that there is life still in him and that is something not to be wasted.

I didn't just give away the movie (I hope) because the beauty of ""Wild Strawberries"" is in the subtlety of its' message.  We travel the journey with Professor Borg and company.  We see his dreams as he experiences them and we, too, can see the distant truth available in each segment of the journey.  For me, the meaning of the title, ""Wild Strawberries"", is the willingness to care enough for someone who can't do much for you and will probably forget that you were the one who went to the trouble to give what you gave.  In other words; kindness for its' own sake alone.

I have the feeling that each time I see ""Wild Strawberries"" I will get more and more out of the movie.  I'm content with what it's given me thus far.  It truly is a beautiful film.",1116892800,6,2215,4.498746867167919

It is enough to say that I personally have always had difficulty ""getting into"" old movies, despite the fact that I have tried and know that there is a value to having this kind of cultural literacy. The fact that Bergman is perceived as one of the greatest directors of all time and my own interest in Scandinavian literature and cinema, I should have given this film (and Bergman's others) a view much earlier. Despite my distaste for or boredom with older cinema, I found this to be an eminently satisfying film in which an elderly professor takes a drive to collect an honorary degree, and along the way, he is visited by visions and apparitions of his past, as though his life is flashing (slowly) before his eyes. His experiences, his regrets, sorrows, and the bitterness and cynicism that have marked him. He is disliked, somewhat feared and estranged even from his son, perceived as cold and disinterested. But what happens to him on his drive is a kind of eye-opening metamorphosis. Not only does the professor change, the perceptions of those around him change, too.",1110758400,4,1196,4.782608695652174
512210,5,6302783356,"I need not repeat all the fine words of the previous writers, except to say I am grateful to Criterion for delivering the same crisp print I remember from years ago when WS was first available in the US. What a fine accomplishment. (Would that the company were to concentrate on historic preservation, as opposed to some of its recent dubious works.)

What I also admire in this DVD is the interview conducted by Jorg Donner. He so well draws out Ingmar Bergman on such a wide variety of issues that you come away with a marvelous intellectual and emotional portrait of the artist. What is more, you hear from the maestro's own mouth of the breadth of his own work during his nearing century --- over 50 films, countless theatrical and operatic productions, some 120, which continue to propel him in his advancing age.

Bergman may well be the Shakespeare of our own age, and Donner's drawing out helps you to realize this. As The Bard drew his English from the first Book of Common Prayer, so may Bergman be the artistic idiom from which not only some of the present filmmakers and writers receive their inspiration, but perhaps may well project into the future.........if writers and directors are wise. For just as Bergman struggled with the Svensk Filmindustri in his early development (just as did Kurosawa with the Japanese Film Institute), so must the present and next generation struggle to find meaning. Not that I am seeing much from them right now, you understand.....

Donner also helps us to see that Ingmar continues to be a work in progress, still growing and changing in aspect of mind and body, proving that the apogee is not met at some legislated retirement age. What a fine interview!

My mind's eye returns to the movie. Isn't it a marvel how Bergman develops his characters, especially the venerable Victor Sjostrom, and the simultaneous vulnerability and lyricism of the kids? What a sweet show.

This is filmmaking at its best, and restoration at its highest. I only regret that Amazon (the Greek of that word literally meaning ""the breastless ones"") prohibits me from giving more than five stars, five less than in my heart.",1106179200,13,2149,4.781671159029649

2. Do you enjoy beautiful cinematography? (Just take a look at the DVD box cover... it's a gorgeous shot!)

3. Do you appreciate symbolism in film?

4. Are you not afraid to watch a movie with subtitles?

If you find yourself saying ""Yes!"" to one or more of the above, then I urge you to check this movie out.

Other points: It has one of the most brilliant dream sequences ever to be put to film. The women in ""Wild Strawberries"" are drop-dead beautiful; my old college roommate vowed to marry a blonde, Swedish girl after watching this movie. The dialogue, despite having to read the subtitles, is excellent, even funny at times.

Ingmar Bergman is considered one of the greatest filmmakers of of the 20th century. If you've never seen any of his work, then let this very accessible movie be your introduction.

1. Would you be interested in watching a story about an old man?
2. Would you have the experience of years to appreciate the ideas behind this movie?
This movie interested ME, and I'm only 17 at the time of writing, but I think that I'm probably the exception; certainly most people my age wouldn't be very interested in watching this, simply because death isn't something that they ever really think about.
This film will probably be best enjoyed by those who feel the strains of time, and by academic proffessors like the one that this movie is about.  Most other people will probably notice director Ingmar Bergman's masterful use of images in this film, but will feel like this film doesn't really pertain to them.
(It will, though. Write down the title and watch it in 40 years!)
Another thing that I'd just like to add at the end is that this film is in Swedish with subtitles, in case you didn't know.  I personally really like the sound of Swedish being spoken, except sometimes what they say isn't translated, which can be a bit annoying... this film can also provide a kind of glimpse of the Swedish way of looking at things; subtle things that are different from other places, which can be interesting if you pay attention.",1096329600,7,1416,4.5234375
512235,5,6302783356,"This is a film about a journey that many, if not all of us, eventually go through: a journey in which, in our old age, our regrets from the past arrive in front of our faces and give us a low, sinking feeling inside. Regret is present in all of our lives. However, if we are able to somehow become strong enough, optimistic enough, and brave enough, we'll be able to stare our regrets in the face and make peace with ourselves, before we have to go off to meet the stone cold hands of death. I hope I don't sound too ""deep,"" gloomy, or spiritual, but the aforementioned statements are exactly what Wild Strawberries is all about. However, on top of the usual amount of regret that a human being has, Isak Borg also buries his regrets and his deep, overwhelming sadness beneath his prestigious job and the academic accomplishments he has made. By experiencing a series of incredibly frightening visions, plus taking a road trip with his daughter in law, Isak is able to carve away at the stone that has sat atop his true, often-upsetting feelings and memories for so many decades. Dr. Borg becomes in touch with his subconscious and remembers how his heart was broken when he saw his childhood love Sara with someone else, and also when he saw his wife with another man. Also, Borg feels death calling him via an infamous vision in which he sees his own corpse in a casket. Perhaps these menacing thoughts, along with his daughter in law's comments, make him realize that he has become a mummy, much like Kanji Watanabe in Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece Ikiru. The truly upsetting part about all of this is that Evald, Borg's son, is terribly against his wife bringing a child into this world. He views this world as a cold and callous place, in which he can't stand to live one more day. As stated by other viewers, there is also present-day Sara and her two male friends, who may be seen as reincarnations of childhood era-Sara, Isak, and Sigfrid. As one can tell, Bergman is a master of subtlely using allegories, metaphors, and symbolism. The final layer of Wild Strawberries which I'd like to discuss is one of Bergman's favorite subjects: the existence and holiness of Jesus Christ versus the non-existence of God. I don't know much about Bergman but I know that he has some negative impressions of Christianity due to his father. However, I view one of the most important scenes, which occurs towards the end of the film, as being rather pro-Christian. When Borg is asked to recite his duties as a doctor and isn't able to do so, he asks Death what the penalty for his failures as a human being are, and Death then responds with ""loneliness,"" to which Isak Borg asks ""Is there any cure?"" Death simply replies ""I don't know. Don't ask me."" Had Borg believed in Christ and not solely relied on science for all the answers of the world, he would have a Redeemer. However, since he looks to science to solve life's questions and to dodge the pain of past regrets, he is left with nobody to turn to besides Death, who, naturally, has no sympathy at all.
 I have a hunch many of you will find my analysis to be way too pro-Christian for a Bergman film, but if we assume that the character he speaks to is supposed to symbolize Death, I think my analysis would make some sense. I'm not saying Christ is God, but instead I'm trying to work with Christianity since that's what Bergman's father and the vast majority of his countrymen practiced. Of course, such an excellent film deserves a beautiful ending, and this is exactly what we get when an enlightened Isak Borg views his parents, whom he remembers as being bitter towards each other, sitting in complete delight and joy beneath a bright, summer sky. Though my review may sound complicated and some of you may disagree with some of my points and/or know more about Bergman's movies than I, I urge anyone and everyone who is even remotely interested in a film's ability to convey moving truths to go out and buy this masterpice on dvd!",1090800000,7,3987,4.568435754189944
512236,5,6302783356,"In this symbolic tale of an old man's journey from emotional isolation to a kind of personal renaissance, Ingmar Bergman explores in part his own past, and in doing so rewards us all with a tale of redemption and love.

Victor Sjostrom, then 80 years old, stars as Professor Isak Borg whose self-indulgent cynicism has left him isolated from others.  Sjostrom, whose work goes back to the very beginning of the Swedish cinema in the silent film era, both as an actor and as a director, gives a brilliant and compelling performance.  All the action of the film takes place in a single day with flashbacks and dream sequences to Borg's past as Borg wakes and goes on a journey to receive a ""Jubilee Doctor"" degree from the University of Lund.  Bergman wrote that the idea for the film came upon him when he asked the question, ""What if I could suddenly walk into my childhood?""  He then imagined a film ""about suddenly opening a door, emerging in reality, then turning a corner and entering another period of one's existence, and all the time the past is going on, alive.""

Bibi Andersson plays both the Sara from Borg's childhood, the cousin he was to marry, and the hitchhiker Sara who with her two companions befriends him with warmth and affection.  The key scene is when the ancient Borg in dreamscape comes upon the Sara of his childhood out gathering wild strawberries.  Borg looks on (unnoticed of course) as his brother, the young Sigfrid, ravishes her with a kiss which she returns passionately; and, as the wild strawberries fall from her bowl onto her apron, staining it red, Borg experiences the pain of infidelity and heartbreak once again.  Note that in English we speak of losing one's ""cherry""; here the strawberries symbolize emotionally much the same thing for Sara.  Later on in the film as the redemption comes, the present day Sara calls out to Borg that it is he that she really loves, always and forever.  Borg waves her away from the balcony, yet we are greatly moved by her love, and we know how touched he is.

The two young men accompanying Sara can be seen as reincarnations of the serious and careful Isak Borg and the more carefree and daring Sigfrid.  It is as though his life has returned to him as a theater in which the characters resemble those of his past; yet we are not clear in realizing whether the resemblance properly belongs in the old man's mind or is a synchronicity of time returned.

Memorable is Ingrid Thulin who plays Mariana, the wife of Borg's son who accompanies him on the auto trip to Lund.  She begins with frank bitterness toward the old man but ends with love for him; and again we are emotionally moved at the transformation.  What Bergman does so very well in this film is to make us experience forgiveness and the transformation of the human spirit from the negative emotions of jealousy and a cold indifference that is close to hate, to the redemption that comes with love and a renewal of the human spirit.  In quiet agreement with this, but with the edge of realism fully intact, is the scene near the end when Borg asks his long time housekeeper and cook if they might not call one another by their first names.  She responses that even at her age, a woman has her reputation to consider.  Such a gentle comeuppance meshes well with, and serves as a foil for, all that has gone on before on this magical day in an old man's life.

See this for Bergman who was just then realizing his genius (The Seventh Seal was produced immediately before this film) and for Sjostrom who had the rare opportunity to return to film as an actor in a leading role many decades past his prime, and made the most of it with a flawless performance, his last major performance as he was to die three years later.",1087776000,115,3754,4.558035714285714

Wild Strawberries cannot be mistaken for anything else than a product of Ingmar Bergman, but isn't a run-of-the-mill Bergman movie. It's a gentle but deep film with unusually few ""horror"" scenes; psychologically it can be horrifying, but it never turns uninteresting or unconvincing. Victor Sjstrm was 79 years old during the filming of Wild Strawberries (early July through late August 1957), and does a great and very convincing job as 73 year old Isak Borg - a pedantic old professor who, on a car-ride --on his way to the University of Lund to receive his jubilee degree-- stops at his childhood home, among other places, and flashed back at his youth. Gunnar Fischer's black and white cinematography is definitely part of what makes this journey mesmerizing. The movie has won 11 awards.
Film historian Peter Cowie's commentary gives very interesting information, and an insightful and professionally presented analysis of the film.

Filmed in 1957, the movie follows an elderly college professor on a car trip to receive an honorary degree. That is the metaphor for a trip through his own subconscious, a looking-back at his whole life through bright and lyrical flashbacks. Many of Bergman's films that followed this one were, IMO, a little abstruse, but Wild Strawberries isn't a difficult film at all. It's rich, deep, evocative, and most of all, humane.

512239,5,6302783356,"Although Ingmar Bergman is justifiably regarded as one of the great filmmakers in film history, this could be his most beautiful and moving film.  It is the story of Professor Isak Borg as he journeys from his home to Lund University to pick up an honorary degree.  Very often in film, a journey can stand for so much more than just a trip from one place to another, and so it is in this movie.  The journey roughly parallels Borg's own life, and plays much the same role in causing Borg to reevaluate his life choices as the three ghosts in Dickens's A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Like Scrooge, Borg's life is one devoid of the most important human qualities, and like Dickens, Bergman has a happy story to tell.  Although we normally associate Bergman with bleak and despairing themes as found in such films as THE SILENCE or PERSONA or WINTER LIGHT, in this film Bergman holds out hope.  As Borg encounters individuals in his trip and struggles with painful memories of the past, he realizes the emptiness of his life, despite his many accomplishments, and comes at the end to embrace life and find love through rediscovering the bonds with his family members.
At the center of the film is the magnificent performance by celebrated Swedish director Victor Sjstrm.  Although not well known outside Scandinavia, Sjstrm was one of the greatest Swedish directors before Bergman.  After he ceased directing, he embarked on a distinguished career as an actor, but this, his final role before his death in 1960, is perhaps his finest role.  Balancing Sjstrm is the remarkably beautiful Bibi Andersson as Sara, the young girl he gives a lift to.  In addition to the wealth of memories that are continually assaulting his psyche, it is the unexpected friendship he finds with Sara that seems to make possibly his redemption at the end of the film.  Bergman regulars, such as Ingrid Thulin, Gunnar Bjrnstrand, and Max von Sydow, fill out the rest of the cast.",1051574400,8,1942,4.767164179104477
512240,5,6302783356,"I am not going to summarize the plot. Amazon.com's editors do a good job of that.
I watched this, Wild Strawberries, right after viewing of The Seventh Seal. Both films have extremely strong visuals and both deal with similar themes--Bergman remains convinced that there is nothing beyond death and hence his characters are symbolizations of the director's existential angst. However, while the characters in The Seventh Seal are archetypal and theatrical, Isaac Borg is extremely human. He is real and so are his emotions and sentiments (with which Bergman so passionately sympathizes). This makes the film touching and Borg's failures and triumphs become our own.
There is another review of this film by a customer (Brian Ridge), which claims that the reason he liked the film is because he is (or was) a film major, which makes it difficult for the rest of the ""mainstream"" to like this movie. He is mistaken, Bergman's films were very well recieved by the American ""mainstream."" Indeed, it was Bergman who pioneered the American foreign film market.
Secondly, the films which he names as being similar to this one are, quite frankly, just some movies by major international  directors--Bunuel, Bergman, Kubrick, Allen, Scorsese, etc. These are all great directors but that does not make their cinema ""similar."" Each had their own cinematic concerns. The only similarity between these directors is that one does not need a film degree to appreciate them!",1043193600,25,1457,5.147679324894515
512241,5,6302783356,"It is hard to imagine living up to this film with the rest of your career with this one in its beginning.  Fortunately, director/writer Ingmar Bergmann was up to that challenge.  I didn't appreciate this film as much when I first saw it decades ago as I do now.  It is a stunning look at an aged professor's long journey inward, exploring where he is from the prism of his past through his underlying consciousness. The dream sequences alone in here are absolute masterworks.  Plus I was startled to discover that Woody Allen's scenes of a character's visiting his childhood home and family in his older self (""Crimes and Misdemeanors"") was used first by Bergmann in this film, decades earlier.

The wild strawberries grow around the house where the professor had his early, formative experiences, especially with the young woman he loved and didn't get to marry.  The scenes with her, where he walks back into the past and interacts with her in his old body, while she is still in her young one, are stunning. He also has to bring some sort of closure to the troubled relationships in his present life, chiefly with his son and daugher-in-law.  I've read some of Bergmann's screenplays and there is a clarity and simplicity to them that is surprising given the complexity of his films.  A great, great talent and I stronly recommend that you also track down his ""Fanny and Alexander,"" which is every bit as stunning but made later in his career.

*
The film itself seemlessly blends reality with dream and memory, and in so doing asks how clear are the distinctions ordinarily drawn between these states. Bergman remarks that the genesis of many of his films were dreams - he remembers virtually all his dreams in vivid detail, and this facility influences his work wonderfully. Yet Bergman had extensive experience in theatre, both writing plays and directing classics, and, of course, in film - in fact he was involved in over 20 films prior to this - so the film has none of the laxity or directionlessness of dreams. He structures each scene, and indeed the film as a whole, tautly, adhering to dramatic priniciples, and sustains the viewer's interest throughout.
*
As an evocation of a state of mind particular to old age, Wild Strawberries is remarkable. Peter Cowie's comments intimate that he, a contemporary of Bergman's, finds this especially moving - his commentary is definitely worth experiencing. The life situation of the lead actor, Victor Sjostrom, was in some ways uncomfortably close to that of the character he was portraying - beset by health problems, aged 79 and himself contemplating death - and one senses how these personal issues enrich his performance and make it horribly disturbing and moving. Borg seems at once sweet and irascible, and Sjostrom was reported not dissimilar on set. Further resonances occur in the 1998 interview with Donner, where Bergman has eerily metamorphosed imperfectly into a version of Isak Borg (Cowie points out they share the same initials).
*
While dominated by the figure of the aged medical Professor, the film contains many counterpoints. Ingrid Thulin as his daughter-in-law is a magnetic screen presence and a remarkable actress (see Bergman's 'Winter Light' for an entirely different performance) - her marital relationship throws Borg's own history into relief. Gunnar Bjornstand's, as husband to Thulin and son to Borg, delivers an icy performance, some of their interchanges being amongst Bergman's most 'chilling', to borrow a word from Cowie's commentary. Then there is the host of grotesque minor characters, each in their own way perfectly drawn. The surface of this film is incredibly complex, and to reduce it to merely 'the reminiscences of an old man on his way to receive an honourary degree', or some such summary, is a misleading injustice.
*
Perhaps also of interest is Woody Allen's film, 'Deconstructing Harry', where an aged writer similarly travels out of town to receive an honorary degree, examining his own life in the process. Woody's use of 'Wild Strawberries' as a template for his own concerns is masterful and, of course, very funny. The skill in the writing and structure of this film is of the highest order. If it fails to match Bergman anywhere, perhaps it is in the imagery, Bergman visuals being formally astonishing, no doubt aided by his cinematographer, Gunnar Fischer.
*
In the interview, Bergman recounts his time in a mental asylum in the 1970's; he also mentions his last wife's death, and other personal details that are startling in their candour. Yet, perhaps a measure of his achievement lies in the fact that his films reveal his thoughts and inner life much more perceptively than even this apparently unguarded conversation. He has expressed himself with unparalleled skill through his art.",1034985600,8,3933,5.118195956454121

Wild Strawberries tells the story of Isak Born (interpretated by Victor Sjstrm, in a very memorable acting),long-time medical professor, who is about to receive a honorary recognition of his work from his former university. The story unfolds and focus more during his travel to the university, in which he turns to learn more about himself and his keening manners and thoughts, not to mention his remembrances and the people he meets, offering them a free ride for their destinations. He also has to deal with his son's ruined marriage, due to a unwelcome child.
Bergman gives a very humanist view here, discussing themes such as the human science against divine beliefs (God), death and loneliness, all together with some escaping irony and sarcasm.
Something I find pretty interesting to mention is that he everything he dreams, he consider them as ""messages"". Sigmund Freud once said that purpose of dreams are to notice situations or discomforts.

512256,5,6302783356,"Ingmar Bergman has always been one of my favorite directors, some of my favorites being ""Cries and Whispers"" and ""The Virgin Spring"" but for some reason I was hesitant to sit through ""Wild Strawberries"". In one of my film classes I was shown the famous ""dream sequence"" and afterwards I thought it was really well done but had no interest in seeing a movie about a man on the brink of death. About a month ago I finally sat down and watched the movie...
""Wild Strawberries"" is one of the most touching well-written films I have ever seen. Bergman has created a film that will touch anyone who has ever experienced loss or has had regrets in their life. Seeing that I am only in my young 20's and found the movie relevant I feel everyone will be able to take something from this movie.
Bergman skilfully uses flashbacks from the protagonist's point-of-view, engulfing the viewer, allowing them to feel everything the main character is as he comes to terms with the mistakes of his life.
I propose that ""Wild Strawberries"" is the true masterpiece of Ingmar Berman, even though ""Seventh Seal"" is given this title by many. It also compliments the movie that Criterion has provided a beautifully transfered version of the film. This is not only a movie worth owning and worth viewing every few months, it is a motion picture treasure.",1019174400,5,1329,4.683760683760684
512257,5,6302783356,"The scene is set as an elderly professor, Isak, is preparing to depart his home in order to receive an honorary degree from a University in Lund.  But he then dreams of meeting with death, a dream that casts a whole different light on his life as he reflects on its meaning over the next few days.
The Prof's daughter-in-law, who journeys with him by auto to Lund, serves as a catalyst.  She is frank, telling him, ""you've been accused of callousness, ruthlessness, selfishness.""  Beneath the surface, she explains, you're ""cold as ice.""  Moreover, she is married to his son and finds him the very same.
Prof. Isak visits his childhood home on the journey, and he has vivid memories (scenes) of his past life: the cousin he once loved, who married his brother instead; his mother/aunt, deaf uncle and other siblings; his long-deceased wife.  The Prof. sees how lonely his life has been.
They pick up three teenagers on the way; the youth are fresh and vigorous.  The two boys argue over whether there is an after-life.  They ask the aging Prof. what he thinks.
This film is great in so many ways: the characters are honest and real.  Their relationship problems are also real, and seldom addressed in this medium.  They certainly gave this viewer  pause for reflection.  Wild Strawberries isn't a flashy film, but neither is it tedious.  I love the way it moves and introduces new characters, each who add a new dimension.  The fighting couple, for example, provide a racy yet tense interlude.
Those of Swedish descent, may also be intrigued by the old world setting and cultural mannerisms of this film, and may see characteristics, perhaps, of their grandparents in its scenes.
All in all, this is highly recommended.",1018742400,4,1719,4.786440677966102
512258,4,6302783356,"Ingmar Bergman's contemplative examination of the interior landscape of mortality and meaning reached an artistic high with ""WILD STRAWBERRIES"" (Criterion), his 1957 masterwork.
Newly transferred in a pristine print with improved subtitles, this beautiful, haunting, black and white film from Sweden's most acclaimed director stars Victor Sjostrom (also a Swedish film director) as Isak Borg, an aging, egocentric, university instructor haunted living alone with his housekeeper who is haunted by nightmares of death and his own past.  When he decides to drive instead of fly to a ceremony at which he is to be honored, he is accompanied by his equally troubled daughter-in-law (Ingrid Thulin).
Along the way, he picks up a youthful hitchhiker who bears a striking resemblance to his one true love.  Bibi Anderson is terrific in both roles.  As Borg bravely seeks the seeds of his failure as husband, lover and father, he somehow redeems himself by his honesty and renewed acceptance of his humanity.
After the success of ""The Seventh Seal,"" this film sealed Bergman's reputation in the paantheon of world class filmmakers.
What might seem dreary and depressing in simple summary is anything but.  This is a thoughtful, even inspiring film that has an almost timeless quality as it addresses some of the most fundamental, universal questions of life, relationships and the inexorable impact of passing time with a capital T.  Film scholar Peter Cowie delivers a fascinating commentary on the origins of this production as an extension of Bergman's own emotional crisis and nightmares. Additional bonus items on this disc include production stills and an outstanding 90 minute documentary ""Ingmar Bergman on Life and Work"" that was seen on Swedish TV in the late 90s.

The wonderful thing is, it's a serious and dramatic film but also entertaining at the same time. Sometimes it moves slow (like the main character, a 78 year old professor) and it also moves faster when younger people are involve in the story. The great Victor Sjostrom gives such a superb human performance that you feel everything he's feeling and I think this is why I love this movie so much, he takes you with him on an emotionnal journey that you don't forget. Other strong points: the beautiful and touching performance of the daughter in law (Ingrid Thulin), the energetic performance of the beautiful young girl (Bibi Anderson), great photography, wonderful screenplay and the score is perfect. I heard often that Bergman made depressing movies, maybe they're not like the musicals of the 50's but I've seen a lot of his work and I don't find it depressing at all, if you watch and listen closely you will always find a message of hope somewhere.
Like Kurosawa, Fellini and Carn to name a few, his movies are great art full of symbolism and humanity, almost inexistant today in cinema. This is a must buy if you like this movie cause the transfer by Criterion is great and they give us a 90 minutes interview with Bergman (very serious but fascinating if you want to know more about the man).

Along with classics like ""Ikiru"", ""Tokyo Story"", and ""Umberto D"", the 1957 Swedish masterpiece ""Wild Strawberries"" is one of the greatest films about old age ever made. With Ingmar Bergman's lyrical and sensitive direction and Gunnar Fischer's fairly expressionistic black-and-white cinematography, the film tells the tale of an old man who reminisces about his past that is filled with loss, regrets, and loneliness. The film is in several respects similar to Federico Fellini's 1963 film ""8 1/2"". Both films open with a nightmare sequence, and mix dreams, flashbacks, and reality throughout the narrative. Both are about a lonely and disillusioned intellectual who embarks on a journey of self-examination. Both men in the films are haunted by the past and tormented by the present, and have to deal with unsettling issues about their lives, their work, and their beliefs. And both ultimately manage to reach some sort of emotional closure.

Criterion's Region-A Blu-ray release of ""Wild Strawberries"" looks stunningly beautiful, making Fischer's gorgeous deep-focus cinematography irresistible to look at. A new 2K transfer was made for this Blu-ray, yielding a nearly pristine picture, in its original 4:3 screen aspect ratio. The 2002 Criterion DVD edition (all-region NTSC) still holds its own, but the eleven-year-old print pales in comparison to the Blu-ray, especially in the presentation of high contrast and deep blacks, which the Blu-ray format is inherently a superior medium for presenting such elements.

Swedish dialogs in the film are supported by optional English subtitles, which look to be identical on both the Blu-ray and DVD. The DVD's subtitles are white letters with black borders. The Blu-ray's subtitles are also white letters, but with thinner, greyer borders, the same font used in all black-and-white Criterion Blu-rays that I have seen. Criterion should consider using a darker border to make the words easier to read against a light or mosaic background. The opening credits are in Swedish on the Blu-ray and DVD. Older viewers may recall that Criterion made a 1991 laserdisc that had English opening credits.

The Blu-ray does not carry over the DVD's picture gallery, which contains 30 or so production photos, actor portraits, and international posters for ""Wild Strawberries"".

The Blu-ray does retain the DVD's full-length audio commentary by film historian Peter Cowie (who also recorded a commentary for Criterion's ""The Seventh Seal"" DVD and Blu-ray). Cowie analyzes the film's characters, themes, and styles, and, with his experience as a Bergman biographer, is able to attribute many of the film's elements to details in Bergman's own life. The opening dream sequence, he says, shows Bergman's homage of German Expressionist films. And the character of Isak Borg is based not on Bergman's father as most would assume, but Bergman himself. Cowie also includes observant remarks such as those regarding Bergman's comedic touches and loathing of action scenes.

The Blu-ray also retains the DVD's 90-minute interview of Bergman recorded for Swedish TV in 1998. In the interview, the pensive 80-year-old director, like Isak Borg in his film, undergoes a profound self-examination of his own. He speaks candidly about his strict upbringing as a child, says how he wishes he were not famous, recalls bitterly his being arrested (and later acquitted) for tax offenses in 1976, and grieves over his wife's death in 1995.

The Blu-ray offers some new extras as well. There is a 4-minute ""introduction"" by Bergman, which is essentially an interview of the director done by Swedish documentarian Marie Nyrerd. Bergman mainly talks about how he was able to get veteran actor Victor Sjstrm to appear in his film. This piece seems to be an excerpt, or perhaps an outtake, from the 2004 documentary made by Nyrerd called ""Bergman Island"" (available as a Criterion DVD).

Another new extra on the Blu-ray is a 16-minute on-the-set footage of the shooting of ""Wild Strawberries"". This 16mm footage was shot by Bergman himself, and so he does not appear in it. Shot in both B&W and color, this piece is also accompanied by a nice audio commentary by the archival film curator at the Swedish Film Institute, Jan Wengstrom, who mentions the silent classic ""The Phantom Carriage"" several times and is obviously a big admirer of the film and its director, Victor Sjstrm, who plays the old man in ""Wild Strawberries"". ""The Phantom Carriage"" is also available on Blu-ray and DVD from Criterion.

All extras on the ""Wild Strawberries"" Blu-ray are presented in upconverted 1080i.

Criterion made a rare subtitle typo on the ""Wild Strawberries"" Blu-ray. After the brunch scene, one of Sara's dialogs reads, ""But sometimes it sees [sic] to me that I'm a lot older than Isak."" That word should be ""seems"", not ""sees"". The 2002 Criterion DVD shows it correctly.

*** MY ORIGINAL REVIEW OF THE 2002 CRITERION DVD, POSTED FEB-12-2002, IS BELOW ***

Bergman's WILD STRAWBERRIES is often accompanied by films like Kurosawa's IKIRU, Ozu's TOKYO STORY, and de Sica's UMBERTO D whenever great films about old age are discussed.  In this DVD's audio commentary, film scholar Peter Cowie also adds the recent Cannes winner AN ETERNITY AND A DAY to the list of such films.  But what Bergman's film resembles the most, in my opinion, is Fellini's 8 1/2.  Both films open with an nightmare sequence, and audaciously mix dreams and reality throughout the course of the narrative.  Both are about a lonely and disillusioned intellectual who embarks on a journey of self-discovery.  Both men in the films are haunted by the past and tormented by the present, and have to deal with unsettling issues about their lives, their work, and their religions.  And both ultimately manage to reach some sort of emotional closure.  The two films differ, of course, mainly in the tone with which the director presents the subjects.  Fellini's film is exhilarating, irreverent, and ironic, while Bergman's is sedate, gloomy, depressing...

There is nothing depressing, however, about the quality of the new Criterion DVD version of WILD STRAWBERRIES, which is yet another standard-setting release from the company that has been setting such standards for the past 18 years.  The DVD's spotless video transfer -- the result of a new print and frame-by-frame digital cleanup -- has made the film look at least 40 years younger.  It is a tremendous improvement over Criterion's laserdisc release in 1991 in that it looks much sharper, has much better contrast (evident in the stark photography used in the opening nightmare sequence), and much clearer details.  The mono audio track has also gone through restoration, and it sounds much cleaner, stronger, and clearer.  The original Swedish opening credit sequence has also been restored for this DVD (the LD has English credits).  The DVD is all-region, with newly translated optional English subtitles.

In the audio commentary, Peter Cowie (who also recorded a commentary on the THE SEVENTH SEAL DVD) analyzes the film's characters, themes, and styles, and, with his experience as a Bergman biographer, is able to attribute many of the film's elements to details in Bergman's own life.  The opening dream sequence, he says, shows Bergman's homage of German Expressionist films.  And the character of Isak Borg is based not on Bergman's father as most would believe, but Bergman himself.  Cowie also includes observant remarks such as those regarding Bergman's comedic touches and loathing of action scenes.

Other extras include 30 or so photos taken from the set of the film, and a 90-minute interview of Bergman recorded for Swedish TV in 1998.  In the interview, the pensive 80-year-old director, like Isak Borg in his film, undergoes a profound self-examination of his own.  He speaks candidly about his strict upbringing as a child, says how he wishes he were not famous, recalls bitterly his being arrested (and later acquitted) for tax offenses in 1976, and grieves over his wife's death in 1995.  One gets the impression from this interview that he is (still) not quite a happy man.  But of course, it is precisely his pessimistic view that has resulted in many of his great films.  But one hopes that, like Isak Borg, he will eventually find the inner peace that will enable him to see the world, however gloomy it is, simply as it is.",1013472000,52,8407,5.151359294636297

On a whim one night in college, I trudged alone through the snow down to the local art-house theater to watch a showing of this movie.  I've always been a movie lover, but my first glimpse of Bergman really showed me the level of art that cinema could aspire to.
Isaak Borg, a man who's lived his life emotionally walled off even from his own family, is approaching death.  On a trip to receive academic honors & visit his family, he reminisces & ruminates through flashbacks and nightmares, on his life and his regrets.  It's a wonderful rumination on what gets left behind in life, and what becomes important when death approaches.
The nightmarish scenes, especially the opener, and the scene of the test in the university, are to me some of the most psychologically disturbing sights commited to film.",1013126400,3,849,4.677852348993288

A quiet reflection on how life's small moments add up into all that there will be... and how we can each make a difference, at any moment, if we so choose. A beautiful film. Some moments feel slightly like moments in Dickens' classic, 'A Christmas Carol.' See this movie, and keep its memory close to your heart. Even in black and white, the aura of a Swedish summer is brought to life.. if you've ever seen one, you know there isn't much that's more beautiful...and well-loved, since the wait for it to come can be so long and dark.

I heard this movie was very good and so I put it on my list of movies to see.  I taped this off of Bravo and waited to watch it when I knew I was attentive enough for subtitles.
I watched the whole movie with interest. I consider it a mediocre film at best.  It was interesting to travel with this elderly man as he journeyed through his life again, reliving and contemplating key scenes.  Also, I was intrigued by his aloof manner, especially with his daughter-in-law.  She was staying with him because she was unhappy in her marriage to his son... mostly because the son was too much like his father in his obtuseness.
In summary, 'Wild Strawberries' is interesting and thought provoking, but I was not wild about it... I hope you will enjoy it more.",998524800,4,917,4.265895953757226
512296,5,6302783356,"'Wild Strawberries' is a road movie.  Whereas the American road movie moves forward through space, the Euroepan variant moves backwards through time, and the places and people 78-year-old Isak Borg meets are actually landmarks from his personal history, as he tries to find out how he ended up a cold, lonely old man alienated from his family.
'Strawberries' has been considered Bergman's most serene work, almost every frame lucidly monochrome, meticulously composed and bathed in light, the cinematic equivalent of a Chekhov play.  But like the Bergman film to which it has most affiliations, 'Fanny and Alexander', the surface benevolence masks great emotional turbulence.  The film is framed as a memoir, Borg looking back over the day's events, in control.  But the different registers - between dream, reality, projection and memory - clear-cut to begin with, start to slip out of his control, so that what seem like 'real' scenes (e.g. the hitch-hiker Sarah, the petrol station) are labyrinthine in their ambiguity.
The film's movement is less towards reconciliation and understanding than infantalisation, detachment and denial.  In this light, Victor Sjostrom's swansong performance is less the embodiment of benevolent old age than a more complex (and, for the audience, truthful) kind of cunning.",998438400,8,1307,5.41871921182266
512297,5,6302783356,"As Fellini would later do with 8 1/2, Bergman took all the elements of life (dreams, memories, fantasies, and reality), brewing them together, but not in the amazing, mind boggling way of Fellini. Instead Bergman approached his work in a modest, nostalgic way. Wild Strawberries does what all great films do... teach its viewer more about himself. It approaches its audience with life changing questions all persons must eventualy come to at some time in their lives. But it doesn't answer them, it simply presents in a subtle, warm way. The film has a sleepy, dream like quality, like reading a good novel in the very wee hours of the night, warm but potent. But its subtle beauty is presented not strikingly but quite mellow, instead of a shout a whisper in the ear. Don't expect instant results, contemplate, enjoy the rennasaince... and await your own.",987724800,6,856,4.86986301369863

Bibi Andersson and Ingrid Thulin are both remarkable. I have read that Bergman had to work hard to convince Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m to do this film. He was apparently retired, burned-out, and withdrawn when Bergman approached him - i.e. the perfect man for the role. This film has such a simple metaphorical elegance and is filmed so beautifully as to evoke awe. All elements work with grace and beauty. I have experienced no scene in cinema like the end of this film when old Isak stands at the edge of the lake and sees his parents dressed in luminous white waving to him affectionately from across the water. The effect is almost overwhelming and cannot be reduced to any analysis of artistic technique. I feel such a powerful upwelling of both joy and sorrow...What a work! There's so much more to say but it's pointless. You must experience this masterpiece.",975715200,3,1024,4.790960451977401
512300,5,6302783356,"When ""Wild Strawberries"" was released in 1957, Ingmar Bergman had been involved in more than a dozen films, everything from coming-of-age  angst drama (the screenplay for ""Torment"" 1944) to sophisticated  comedy (""Smiles of a Summer Night"" 1955). With ""Wild  Strawberries"" (and ""The Seventh Seal"" the same year) his  name became well known outside art house circles. (""Now Bergman means  Ingmar, not Ingrid,"" as one magazine put it.) His career even became  the cover story for an issue of Time. One can only imagine American movie  audiences going, out of curiosity, from the Deluxe color naughtiness of  ""Peyton Place"" to Bergman's dark vision. Dark, yes; cold, no. In  fact, this is one of Bergman's warmest films and, I think, one of the  finest films ever made. The picture involves three worlds: The immediate  world, the world of the past, and the world of dreams. As Professor Borg, a  78 year-old widower, makes a day trip from his home in Stockholm to the  cathedral in Lund (where he is to receive an honorary degree) he deals with  all three worlds: the present (his son's estranged wife who is traveling  with him, the people they meet en route, the old professor's ancient  mother), the past (painful memories of his youth), and the future (a series  of persecution nightmares), all hauntingly photographed by Gunnar Fischer.  (The 1985 film ""DreamChild"", about the old age of Alice Pleasance  Liddell, has almost the same construction.) I suppose it's impossible not  to compare ""Wild Strawberries"" with ""A Christmas  Carol"". Like Scrooge, Professor Borg is visited by the  ""ghosts"" of bitterness, unhappy memories, and nightmares -- and  survives to find himself better adjusted to himself and other people. And  Bergman obviously admires Dickens: whole scenes in ""Fanny and  Alexander"" are lifted from ""David Copperfield"". But Bergman  avoids egregious sentiment, unlike De Sica, whose geriatric study  ""Umberto D"" comes dangerously close to schmaltz. (I keep thinking  Lewis Stone and Lassie.) Neither the professor's frailties nor his  revelations are trivialized -- especially important in the relationship  with his son, whose life has been thwarted by the professor's coldness. In  a flashback, the pregnant daughter-in-law tells the professor how her  husband has told her in no uncetain terms that he condemns the idea of  bringing a child into this absurd world. It's a revealing scene -- and,  incidently, one of the most gracefully executed flashbacks you'll ever see.  Another key scene occurs when the professor's car is sideswiped by another  car occupied by a couple caught in a horrific misalliance, both the man and  the woman greedily feeding off their hatred for each other. As the men work  to get the couple's overturned car upright, the female stranger stands over  them mocking ""He strains his creaky limbs to show off in front of that  pretty young girl!"" However, it is the professor in the frame wih the  woman, not her husband. Later, the professor confesses to his  daughter-in-law that the couple reminded him of his own rotten marriage.  Sunny? Hardly. Yet the sun shines even in Sweden and the conclusion of  ""Wild Strawberries"" could be construed as a happy ending, though  not pat and omniscient. Another plus is the excellent cast, including  VIctor Sjstrm (who had directed films in Hollywood during the silent era)  as Professor Borg, Ingrid Thulin as his daughter-in-law, and Gunnar  Bjrnstrand as his son. Max von Sydow can be seen briefly as a Texaco  attendant, centuries away from the tormented knight of ""The Seventh  Seal"". Bibi Andersson has a dual role, as a hip young hitchhiker in  the ""present"" sequences and as the professor's lost love in the  ""past"" sequences. To my knowledge, she and Sjstrm are the only  two actors to appear in all three worlds. These three worlds may seem  forbidding to the uninitiated, but open up to them and you'll find they're  filled with the intriguing artistry of a cinema master.",965088000,6,3976,5.071207430340557

7831233,4,6302783356,"What does this movie mean?  For me it was a touching personal reminiscence of the process of getting old.
Sjostrom is radiant as Professor Bork, an aging Swedish Doctor and Professor who is on the way to receive an honorary degree.  Professor Borks journey to receive his award will take him about one day.  As he travels he dreams about the course of his life and its end.  He reviews the emotional pain of his life in its events as he daydreams.  In the real world as he travels we see him honored and thanked by young and old for his contributions to the lives of others.  He is not aware though of the many good things he has done.  The sum of his lifes regret, Bergman seems to be telling us, is his ability to be detached and cold with respect to the events of life or to put that another way his inability to be passionate in the way that others are passionate.  His punishment has been to be lonely.  But the passion that Bergman shows us, the passion that Prof Bork lacked in his life, was an immoral, illegitimate passion.  So I am not sure that Bergman has in the end said anything coherent in his comment about being dispassionate in life.
Are immoral people not lonely at the end of their lives?  Not in my experience.  In my experience virtue is its own reward.  Is this coldness, this loneliness, a Swedish, a Northern European problem that Bergman wrestled with himself?
I am not sure this film says anything.  In some respects this film is like Ozus films.  It depicts ordinary life in an extraordinary and at times in a very beautiful way.  Real life is extraordinary.  It is not ordinary.",1511136000,,1607,4.41156462585034

In the opening minutes of the film he admits he has allowed himself to become isolated from others and declares that his most annoying characteristics are being a pedant and thinking that women should not be allowed to smoke in the car. He has one son, also a doctor, and his wife Karin has been dead for many years.

Professor Borg is supposed to get an honorary degree in Lund that evening, and after waking from a horrifying dream that seems to be about death and loss of identity that only Ingmar Bergman could cook up, decides at 3AM to drive his car rather than fly as originally planned. His housekeeper of 40 years has a fit and he teases her that she is carrying on like a wife. In spite of the early hour his only son's wife, who is staying with him, asks to come along too.

So off they go at dawn for the long drive up the coast. In fact, I found Professor Borg to be a good guy. His daughter-in-law, who is his guest, talks about how ruthless he is. I'm sorry I just don't see it. When they stop at a gas station the young attendant talks about how Borg is still remembered from decades before when he was a physician there and insists on paying for his gas. Borg cheerfully invites a young girl named Sara and her two male companions to ride with them as far as Lund - they are going to Italy together. When the group is sideswiped by a couple, Borg invites them to ride with them. It is only because the husband berates his wife to the point that she hits him repeatedly that they are asked to leave, and then it is the daughter in law who does the asking.

Borg makes various stops. He stops at his summer home as a child and revisits, not a memory, but an episode he could not have seen or heard because he was elsewhere at the time, between his first and true love Sarah and his brother Sigfrid, as he tries to steal her away from Isak with some bold physical behavior and must have won, because the two went on to marry and have six children. Yet, Borg does not seem angry. Instead you see a trace of a smile and nostalgia on his face, especially when he sees Sara in tears talking to her cousin about Isak's sweetness versus Sigfrid's physicality and how she is horrified that she is attracted to the latter.

This is really the only pleasant dream/daydream/memory of the several along the way. In the end I figured that the young girl and her two struggling paramours are probably signifying Isak, Sigfrid, and Sara in his youth, and the feuding couple probably represents Borg's own unhappy marriage in which, after seeing how he felt about Sara and how he must have felt losing her to his own rather boorish brother, the wife could not have helped but feel like anything but the back up plan. Isak and Karin had only the one child, their son, compared to Sigfrid's six. His own son, married for many years, has none. It's like Bergman is equating fertility to connectivity, not just to a spouse, but to people in general. In the end, it's not like Isak Borg was a bad person who redeems himself because of all of these dreams and touches with the distant past, but he does seem more at peace with his coming death as he readies for bed that night.

I'd highly recommend it. I'm no expert on Swedish cinema or Bergman at all, but I thought it was interesting how Bergman seems to be saying that Borg's ""wrong turn"", if there was any at all, could be traced back to losing his first and true love to his own brother, and that everything after that just fed off of that disappointment. As I look back on my life, I think that I can agree with that assessment.

And now a word about the daughter-in-law. She accuses Isak of having said some just horrible things. Things he does not remember saying and things the audience never hears. Perhaps she wants to blame her husband's bleak and icy behavior on someone and Isak is convenient? At any rate, by journey's end she has warmed to Isak enough to confide in him about a great turmoil in her marriage. This was more of a change in her than any change I saw in Isak.

This one is really worth a look, even if you normally aren't into foreign film. My review is just my take on the plot. I'm sure it means many things to many people or we wouldn't still be discussing and watching it 60 years later.",1489017600,5,4358,4.313797313797314
