7966444,3,B00006AUIQ,"Finally, the end of the series. Well it's not really a series as the first two are not worth watching. There is a gradual improvement here & since the shows don't rely on each other for story line you can watch just #3 & save some time & frustration.

The show is in modern day L. A. & a clan of scared or maybe cautious vampires is using the old come to my dance club routine to draw in food. It's close to impossible for a vampire to get blood before they have either been screwed or watched someone get screwed & that's the story in a nutshell (pun?). In this movies defense I admit there is less focus on sex & more focus on feast in this third film. The erstwhile hero a newspaper reporter is lame enough to have died 30 seconds into the film & the Dr. Van-Helsing replacement Mr. Van-Drugsing should have been left on a street that had no video equipment. I don't blame the actors. It's the writing & direction that needs upgrading. They do introduce the concept of a pure vampire which most shows don't mess with & by movies end that part has become good enough I wished that III had been the original so the story developed from there. It appeared they were catching on to the idea of a vampire story not just screwing interrupted by teeth.

If you heard about this group of vampire shows & want to check it out either rent or buy a used copy of III. I & II will disappoint you. If you like robotic poorly simulated sex done by people who are too good to try then this is your set. Buy all three. A reluctant 3 Stars.",1266624000,,1525,4.1661016949152545
7966445,5,B00006AUIQ,"This is the final video in the Embrace the Darkness trilogy. I thought this one was the best of the three films. We've got a new Jennifer (Brooke Larele). She's hot and I liked her better than the second Jennifer, but not as much as the first. Most of this video is the same as the other two, vampire finds victim, has sex with victim, bites victim. It isn't until the end that the plot kicks into gear and everything gets tied up. But up until then we are treated to many beautiful women and several very good sex scenes.

There are nine sex scenes. Seven are boy/girl and two are girl/girl. There are some new faces (Brooke Larele and Vanessa Lynch) as well as some old favorites (Holly Hollywood, Ava Lake, and Sasha Rochelle). All of the sex scenes go to completion and you can hear the sounds of the actors over the music. There is some really good stuff here including an excellent lesbian scene between Brooke and Sasha.

I recommend this one.",1092614400,6,950,4.422857142857143

Brooke Laralee is quite a number and it's too bad she's not in any other films. Here she plays a kind of super vampire who can go out in the sun and is extraordinarily powerful",1032825600,2,299,4.0508474576271185
