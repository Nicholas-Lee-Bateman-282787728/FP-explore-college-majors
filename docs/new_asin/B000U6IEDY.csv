8212176,4,B000U6IEDY,"This Mexican sex-comedy from 1988 ""Rumbera caliente"" (""Hot Party Girl""), was a lot funnier than I was expecting! It was directed by Alfredo B. Crevenna (who directed over 150 films in his career), and featured: the lovely Sasha Montenegro, Polo Ortin, Sergio Ramos, and the sexy Martha Elena Cervantes. Here Sasha played 'Mariana' the local town-beauty (state of Veracruz), who had to give up her small store because she was behind in the rent and helped care for the town's orphaned children. So she left town to enter a dance contest (which she of course won!), in Mexico City. She returned triumphant, got married and settled down to look after her orphans (these films always manage to throw a little morality and vulgarity into the mix so well!). The film was filled with the jokes and sexual innuendos, that made this subgenre the box-office champ of the 80's in Mexico. To be honest, Polo Ortin and Sergio 'El Comanche' Ramos stole the show here. Especially Polo Ortin as 'Pancho', he was 'Mariana's' uncle and the town's self-serving Police Commissioner (this police force consisted solely of 'Pancho' and his deaf-mute deputy!). The beautiful Martha Elena Cervantes (whose prolific film career began in the 1950's) was great as  always, here she played 'Pancho's' love interest. Sasha Montenegro (who in 1995 went on to marry Mexico's ex-president Jose Lopez Portillo, but that's another story!), never looked lovelier and sexier (she was a little older and her figure had filled-out completely), than here in ""Rumbera caliente"". This woman was a huge star and sex-symbol in Mexico and Latin America and excelled in this type of comedy throughout most of her career. There was an uncredited appearance by Angelica Ruiz (with nudity of course) where she played one of the girls in a bathhouse of sorts, where 'Pancho' got a little more than he bargained for! Hilarious stuff! A good time will be had by everyone who appreciates this type of comedy fare. The DVD picture quality from Laguna Films is very good. NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 92 mins. (BTW: Although Ninon Sevilla and Angelica Chain appear credited on the cover, they did not work in this film. Must be an oversight!)

Love and Peace,
