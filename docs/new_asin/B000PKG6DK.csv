8191976,4,B000PKG6DK,Good slant on story line. Takes some interesting turns through out the movie. Take note that you do have to use the english subtitles.,1355529600,,134,4.625
8191977,4,B000PKG6DK,I bought this movie while vacationing in Montreal and Quebec City as I wanted a movie to remind me of Montreal. It was surprisingly good although I love movies in the French language anyway. The only thing I would have changed would have been to have an extra twist at the end where the cop goes back to the apartment and finds something that disagrees with one of the stories portrayed. I thought Laurence Leboeuf played a particularly good role as the friend of Karine Vanasse's character.,1270944000,,491,4.655172413793103
