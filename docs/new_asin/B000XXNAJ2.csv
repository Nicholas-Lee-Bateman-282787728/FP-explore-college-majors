8230257,5,B000XXNAJ2,"This movie is based on Tolstoy's last novel published in 1899, Resurrection. This version has sub titles but English is not one of the languages. The dialogue, however, is in English. The story involves a Russian Nobleman(Dimitri) who begins a relationship with a maid who follows in a downward spiral in life until becoming a prostitute. The Russian Nobleman feels a responsibility for the maid's downward spiral and there are dramatic court scenes inside andoutside the court as Dmitri tries to rescue the maid from her conviction in a murder case. There are also dramatic scenes inside the Russian prisons and marches to Siberia of the prisoners. The movie details the cases of some of the political prisoners. Dimiti succeeds in obtaining a exoneration of the maid. It would have been nice if English subtitles were included but that only makes the viewwer pay more attention to the dialogue. Highly recommended.",1371340800,4,916,5.072847682119205
