7889863,3,6305465703,An upbeat mixture of entertainment and instruction. After a few viewings I will pass this one along. It would be great to know the name of the swing line dance that is the last performance!,1273363200,,189,4.428571428571429
7889864,4,6305465703,"I really liked this vid.  I felt I learned a lot from the instructors, Evin and Noel, and they were really cute, too!  The music was so dated though.  I wish they had used some more classic stuff and left out all the extra footage.  I would have liked more time with the instructors.  After doing a google search on them, the female instructor turned out to be pretty popular.  Maybe I'll be able to take a lesson from her in person one day!  I recommend it, but wish they'd put out another video of them without all the extraneous junk.",1092268800,2,537,4.257425742574258
7889865,5,6305465703,"After checking out several videos on Swing Dance from the
library, after renewing and reserving this video numerous time and after several months of Swing lessons from some
excellent teachers, I obviously am fascinated with this video,
so much so that I put it on my wish list for a birthday
coming up real soon.  The instructors were very easy to
follow and very charming and entertaining! I love the music
and hope to buy a recording of the music by Nancy Hays and
Righteous Swing Band.  I've already purchased CD by Cherry
Poppin' Daddy's.  It's so much fun!",1002672000,,561,4.646464646464646
7889866,5,6305465703,"This is one of the most comprehensive videos about swing dancing, that I have ever seen.  Each pattern is taught slowly enough to let it ""sink in"".  The pattern is repeated from different angles, (both the male  and the female parts) and the camera focuses on the footwork.  When the  lessons have been taught, there are little blurbs about clubs, clothing,  and some general dancing.  Overall, I really enjoyed this video",963446400,3,422,4.859154929577465
