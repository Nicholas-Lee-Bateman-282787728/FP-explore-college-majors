708638,4,6303662544,"Yes, ""The Best of Everything"" can be seen as a trash version of ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" or ""Three Coins in the Fountain"":
Three career girls all take an apartment together, and ... !
You know the type, don't you?
Well, the difference between ""Best"" and ""Millionaire/Coins"" is significant. In the latter two movies, there is the idea that the guys might WANT to sleep with the career girls, but they never can get to first base, not without the old wedding ring pay-off, that is. They are movies made still in the spirit of censorship, where the worried audience can sigh, ""Oh thanks heavens!"" as certain sexual situations are always diffused.
But that's not what happens with ""The Best of Everything"". Suzy Parker tries to play it cool with her lover, Louis Jourdan, but descends into madness because he loves and leaves her; Diane Baker ""goes all the way"" with Bob Evans, and finds herself ""in a fix""; and heroine Hope Lange resists the advances of both Brian Aherne and Stephen Boyd only to find herself in a sordid affair with her old, now married, fiancee. I guess it's movies like this that illustrated why sex ed needed to be included in the public school curricula. All three gals are downright stupid where men are concerned--didn't their mothers teach them ANYTHING?

Now, you'll see that Joan Crawford is pictured rather large on the advertisement. It's true that she's the biggest star in the movie, but it's a supporting role for her. In a way, it's too bad that she didn't get more roles like this as she got older, because she is the one person comporting herself with dignity at the publishing house where all these dopey women work. She's one of the head editors who put career before family, and now what has she got to show for it? She really ought to have a banner on her door proclaiming, ""Abandon hope, all ye career girls who enter here!"" Poor Joan must take the crusts thrown her by HER married lover, whom she beseeches on the phone. Well, I certainly hope that Hope Lange comes to her senses and wakes up and smells the coffee and doesn't turn down anymore dates with Stephen Boyd!
The reason I rented this in the first place was because I liked the glossy look of the cover,believing it would be a Lush Life movie, and that's quite true. So, if you want to see something with photography of NYC like ""Three Coins in the Fountain"", then you won't be disappointed. Of course, the storyline is rather inane, but at least it won't get in the way of things.",1019779200,,2483,4.554809843400448
708639,2,6303662544,"from an audience point of view
To the point - Don't be fooled by the cover, Joan's part in this film is only that of a supporting role. The film was ok and so were the three other girls. (Diane Baker had made another film with Joan in 1964 called Strait Jacket in which she had a better part ).Privately Joan lost her husband during this period so she was still in recovery, but that didn't affect her acting, after all she was a real pro.",1010448000,4,439,4.116279069767442
708640,5,6303662544,"This is one of those 50s era movies that I watch over and over, (some others are ""A Summer Place"", ""Imitation of Life"", ""Young at Heart"", and ""Parrish"").  It is so much of its time and place - a perfect soap opera, great NYC locations, and the breathtaking contrast of the cultural norms portrayed versus the cultural norms of today. (My personal fave is April's boyfriend's socks - watch it and you'll see.)  Too cool!  I love all the girls, innocent April, ambitious Caroline, and confused Gregg.  Hope Lange is such a very pretty woman, Diane Baker is luminously innocently beautiful, and Suzy Parker is simply gorgeous.  You won't be disappointed.",1003017600,3,651,4.828828828828829

708642,4,6303662544,"In its day, this film was a daring expose of the lives and loves of the white collar ""working girl,"" then still a relative novelty, consigned to the bottom of the professional pecking order.  Today, it  stands as one of the most telling commentaries of mid-century social  relations ever made.  A guaranteed eye-opener for those who romanticize the  '50s as a time of placid, happy prosperity.  I also imagine it will be  truly shocking to some of today's feminists, providing the kind of  perspective that cannot be learned from a world in which opportunities are  much closer to equal.",959817600,7,587,4.848484848484849
708643,5,6303662544,"A very fun, enjoyable movie - a little dated by today's standards, but still a good solid script performed by some great actors.
The classic tale of three girls who come to the big city is told in a much classier,  sopphisticated way than other attempts (i.e. Valley of the Dolls and it's  ilk)
Fans of 50's furniture will be in seventh heaven in this film,  especially as the office that the majority of the characters work in has a  lot of the furniture that the Eame's designed for Herman Miller.
And if  you love scenery chewing (like I do) there's the wonderful Miss Crawford as  the bitter carreer woman.
The only slightly bad thing about this movie is  the somewhat hackneyed theme song - although it's sort of fun to listen to  all of it's different variations throughout the film.",947808000,8,789,4.546099290780142
708644,5,6303662544,"The first five minutes alone of this movie provide fodder for discussion of historical attitudes toward women.  Hope Lang arrives at an office building clutching a job listing for a secretary with the heading above  ""Help Wanted--Female"".  She discovers that all the women in the  office are engaged, and the office supervisor herself is only working to  save up for her wedding dress.  Joan Crawford plays a bitter spinster who  has chosen a career over marriage and now is having an unhappy affair with  a married man, and taking out her resentment of her situation on the  secretaries who work for her.  Lang's roommates are coworkers who are also  seeking love and aspire to little else, as their fates in the film reveal.  The rest of the film is filled with male characters who regularly lecture  women on the perils of careers, as well as the women's shortcomings as  women.  One editor at the office pinches and generally preys on all the  young secretaries (we don't find out he's married until an offhand remark  in the last reel), and the women's reaction to this then accepted form of  sexual harassment is to laugh it off or put up with it as a normal working  hazard.  I recommend the film for anyone who wants to see the feminine  mystique of the 1950s and 60s firsthand.",911347200,6,1286,4.651785714285714

The costumes, hairstyles, furnishings and all the footage of Manhattan features that time in America and brings it back to life... (if you're old enough to rememember.) Louis Jordan, the classic, handsome leading man with a French accent, along with lovely Hope Lange (a favorite from ""Where The Boys Are"") and the beautiful Suzy Parker make this a nice trip back in time.

708849,5,6303662544,"I was first exposed to this womans picture (as anything to do with romance or heartbreak was called in my day, or in todays parlance chick flicks), when I went to a matinee with a bunch of my high school classmates. The minute Johnny Mathis crooned over the main credits the entire audience was putty in the movies grasp.

I had fallen in love with actress Hope Lange in Bus Stop, but when I saw Suzy Parker unleash her red locks as openers for her unforgettable entrance, I heard myself gasping along with the rest of the crowd. No one today can make that kind of Entrance - it's a sign of the times, I guess.

If youve never seen this film, it deals with the stories of 3 secretaries in NYC in 1959 and was based on a novel belonging to what were then called bestsellers. If youve watched Mad Men it will be obvious to you where that look came from.

The film was supposed to catapult its young performers to super stardom, but, in a later interview Joan Crawford stated that it was the veterans (Brian Aherne and herself) who more or less walked off with the picture, at least with the critics of the time. Crawford obviously enjoyed herself in her usual 50s Medusa part: she easily devours the entire cast with great relish and such huge jewelry that it makes one wonder how she could walk without toppling over.

Though its all done with the expected Jerry Wald slick touch, some of the social mores presented are quite startling considering the source. That said, some of it has not dated well. (Now Im just someone who had an AFFAIR!!! being the most famous of its campy bits).

The Blu-Ray is absolutely perfect Unfortunately the price aint so palatable - I bought my copy as a used item. Its a shame that 20th Century either releases its old movies as Pan & Scan cheapies, or as overpriced boutique exclusives.",1483574400,6,1819,4.45045045045045

Great cast and certainly a movie director who knew how to create a gripping film out of a rather bland debut novel.

The so-so commentary misses - and gets outright wrong (e.g. ""W"" =/= ""M"") - a few places and things of the era, but these only add to the intrigue and enjoyment of the movie, which is easy given its Technicolor filming.

I was naive and coming of age, and found this movie and novel informative about the real world, and world we must all eventually face. Publishing has charged a lot, and maybe the office politics, but it is still a fact of life. The women in this movie are like many today. They men women deal with are different style and character. But good women still fall for the wrong and suffer and ignore good men, who yearn to find good women.

This is a well made movie with good character models that we can learn from. The times change, people remain basically the same. Watch this movie and read the novel for a complete appreciation of Rona Jaffe's creative skill.

She made a big hit with her first book here. Movies don't usually follow the book that closely and this film is no exception. I like the movie version better than the book. The book is not as up beat as what's up on the screen here.

709358,4,6303662544,"I've mentioned previously how much I enjoy the very particular style of melodrama that was popular from the mid 1950's through the mid 1960's. This was a transitional period, where (year by year) films were gradually becoming more daring in discussing adult themes and situations. These pictures may seem a bit quaint when compared to the anything-goes style of cinema that had developed by the early 1970's, but they're a heck of a lot of fun to watch.

So, I just settled back to enjoy the soapy goodness of ""The Best of Everything,"" a late 1950's entry in the genre. While I can't say it was the best of these melodramas that I've seen---there have been others that I've liked better---there was still much to appreciate in this tale of three young women finding that life in the big city is not what they had hoped. And if you're looking for it, you can see elements of later films already in place here---think of this as a sort of fifties version of The Devil Wears Prada. Heck, I even see a bit of Valley of the Dolls here, though this film is more straightforward and doesn't come anywhere near the campiness of Dolls.

I really did appreciate the view this film afforded of life nearly 55 years ago. The exterior location shots give us glimpses of a New York City that has disappeared forever, and all the interiors are VERY 1950's modern; how chic! (and pleasantly nostalgic overall).

For a bit of social commentary, you get a look at office politics of the time---and it's not a pretty picture. The atmosphere is a bit misogynistic, and also features a working environment where casual sexual harassment is a matter of course---I daresay women today would not tolerate situations like these for an instant.

Anyway, for a bit of fun period melodrama by all means give it a try. If you're the type who enjoys things like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Picnic-Restored/dp/0767827791/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Picnic : Restored</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peyton-Place/dp/B0000DJZ8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peyton Place</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Summer-Place/dp/B000JU8HBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Summer Place</a>&nbsp;and the like I'll happily recommend this one.

(Man, the office environment has changed in more ways than one---do large corporations have huge open work areas like this anymore, for the secretarial pool, or is it all cubicals now? You know, I had TOTALLY FORGOTTEN how very loud a room full of typewriters is---it's like listening to hail on a tin roof. Now that sound took me right back---and also makes me feel incredibly old. Ha! Well, you know you're getting on in years when you realise that things that were commonplace to you are completely unknown to the current generation ---- like the sound of a multitude of typewriters all going at once.....)

The artwork for the picture prominently features Joan Crawford's image, but she really only has a guest-starring sort of role; the story focuses on a very attractive group of up-and-coming Hollywood hopefuls.",1329782400,,3169,5.537190082644628
709359,3,6303662544,"Throughout much of the 20th Century, society dictated that a woman's preferred career should be that of wife and mother, and women who worked outside the home were frequently pitied.  THE BEST OF EVERYTHING has precisely this mindset as it follows the unsavory romantic adventures of various women employed by a New York publishing company.  Amanda (Joan Crawford) and Barbara (Martha Hyer) offer cautionary tales of women who have fallen in love with married men, but the story focuses on three younger women who experience romantic disasters of their own.

Caroline Bender (Hope Lang) is working until her boyfriend returns returns from out-of-country studies.  When he jilts her, she proves she has both the drive and talent to make a career.  She also attracts the attention of executive Mike Rice (Stephen Boyd), who feels she is wasted in the business world.  April Morrison (Diane Baker) is a somewhat air-headed young woman who slides into an affair with the slimy Dexter Key (Robert Evans) and gets in trouble in more ways than one.  Drop-dead-beautiful Gregg Adams (Suzy Parker) has aspirations of stage stardom and runs afoul of slimy stage director David Savage (Louis Jourdan.)  In between these unpleasantnesses they must endure the pinches and pats of a genuinely male-chauvanist business society and do their best to stay ahead of the boss when he chases them around the desk.

Lang, Baker, and Parker are enjoyable, but the real knock-out performance belongs to Joan Crawford, who has less than ten minutes of screen time but who--as one critic famously commented--makes almost everything else about the film seem irrelevant.  She is an embittered woman whose married lover will not leave his wife and she takes out her frustration on various underlings.  Say what you like about Crawford, she never gave less than one hundred and ten percent, and she plays her first scenes with Hope Lang as a smiling, bejeweled cobra; later, when she tells her married lover to go to hell during a telephone call, her intonation is such that one imagines him stewing in the flames already.  It really is an astonishing performance, and in a perfect world Crawford would have been nominated as Best Supporting Actress for the role.

The film makes a powerful, if somewhat unintentional and distinctly melodramatic, statement about the hell women endured in the male-dominated work place of the 1950s, but this and Crawford aside, it is an extremely stodgy movie that is best remembered for its visual design.  The gleaming offices are memorably post-war, the costumes are indicative of the era, and New York's cityscape has seldom been so effectively filmed.  Both picture and sound are excellent.  The DVD includes a bonus audio track by Rona Jaffe, who wrote the novel, and film historian Sylvia Stoddard.  Its worth a listen and quite often more entertaining than the film itself.

709362,4,6303662544,"The plot is well-documented by many other reviewers.  I love Johnny Mathis singing the title song, juxtapositioned with the street scenes in New York of the many people coming from the subway, bus, and walking down the street.  And as the mail clerk tells Carolyn Bender when she arrives at the empty Fabian offices, ""give it two minutes, then run for cover!""  He does not exaggerate.  I watched this movie some years ago because Joan Crawford was in it--and she does not disappoint, though I wish she'd had a more prominent role.

The music is beautiful as Carolyn (Hope Lange) surveys some of the offices and looks around the typing pool mere minutes before all the employees arrive.  Though not often mentioned, I think Sue Carson (Mary Agnes--head of the typing pool) is great, and as Stephen Boyd (Mr. Rice) remarks during her pre-wedding office party, ""She's the smartest one here.""  I don't think she was in any other films for some reason.

One question I had about the fashion of the time, which I've discussed with a friend on here, concerns the hatboxes one sees many women carrying during the initial street scenes.  I have the idea that they were often used as forerunners to today's backbacks (which fortunately, finally, gives us guys something to use for the same purpose.)  Something large enough to carry a lunch, newspaper, and anything else one may have wished to take to work--but too large for a purse.  Does anyone remember or know if this is what they were used for?  I was in second grade at the time the film was made, so was not employed to observe on my own--LOL.

Though ""The Best of Everything"" starts off well, as a passable drama, it gradually descends into clichd melodrama, with foolish women getting involved with men who have only one thing on their minds. (It's surprisingly blunt for a 1959 film.) When the pregnant Diane Baker jumps out of a car to escape her rotten boyfriend, you'll be smiling. Then you'll be laughing at her hospital scene in which she wears the obligatory head bandage to indicate Serious Injuries. And when Suzy Parker falls off a fire escape to her death -- well, there won't be a wet eye in the house. (I was laughing my head off.)

Her portrayal of a obsessive stalker was pathetic.  Louis Jordan played her love interest, and he just did not play the part well either.  Joan Crawford was the strong-willed Editor of a publishing company and you felt sorry she had to play such a pathetic part.

Overall this is a chick flick gone bad.  Three young women's lives (Suzy Parker, Hope Lange,  Diane Baxter)  are followed as they run in and out of bad relationships in a bad movie.

The stunning cinematography in the opening sequence makes me long to have been able to experience New York City as it was in 1959 but The Best of Everything captures the wide-eyed wonder of it all so well I think you would need a time machine to do better.

I had been interested in the movie ever since seeing a clip from the film in TCM's fascinating Joan Crawford bio (which coincidentally comes as a bonus on the flip side of the 2003 Mildred Pierce dvd). I expected a fun movie but was thrilled with the fine performances of so many in the film, particularly Diane Baker. The movie also makes me sad there weren't more big film roles for the lovely Suzy Parker. The scene in which she first appears in the film will bowl you over.

After you've watched the film treat yourself to watching it again with the Sylvia Stoddard/Rona Jaffe narrative turned on. All the fun things you'll pick up about the movie, the cast, the set, and the times in general are priceless.

Tip: If after watching the movie you have the wonderful soundtrack stuck in your mind you'll want to grab a copy of the 2002 CD right away as they are already getting pretty hard to find.

709449,4,6303662544,"Rona Jaffe's breakout novel THE BEST OF EVERYTHING was prime fodder for a splashy 1960s Hollywood melodrama right from the start, so it's little wonder the movie is still such a delight to behold some forty years after it's original release.

It's kind of like ""Valley of the Dolls"" with typewriters...  Bright-eyed Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) comes to Fabian Publishing clutching the job advertisement which proudly promises it's secretaries ""the best of everything!"".  Instead, Caroline winds up as the latest gumshoe to the imperious senior editor Amanda Farrow (Joan Crawford in a glorified cameo).  Fellow secretary Gregg Adams (Suzy Parker) is only holding on until she lands a role on the Broadway stage; whilst sweet newcomer April Morrison (Diane Baker) finds herself knocked up by a guy who keeps an abortion doctor on speed-dial.

Hope Lange, riding high on the success of her Academy Award-nominated performance as Selena in 1957's ""Peyton Place"", is luminous as Caroline; yet the star performance (in my opinion) belongs to Suzy Parker.  Gregg is kind of like the older, nuttier sister of Neely O'Hara from ""Valley of the Dolls"", and Ms Parker's performance is a master class in how to eat the scenery!  The rest of the sets are reserved for La Crawford, and her ""rabbit-faced wife"" telephone call is beyond belief.  Diane Baker also aquits herself nicely; she'd be sparring with Joan Crawford yet again in 1964's camp classic ""Strait-Jacket"".

The film featured a bunch of new Hollywood stars with Joan starring as Amanda, the head of a publishing house in New York City where the movie was set. Amanda was a tough-as-nails woman who put her employess though hell. Many critics and fans felt that Joan's role in this film was a step down for her as she didn't even receive top billing, but Crawford would go on to believe, and rightly so, that she stole the movie from her younger co-stars because she had the experience and the guts they didn't have.
 ""The Best of Everything"" would spawn an ABC daytime soap opera of the same name in 1970 that only lasted six months. Another Joan Crawford film would also spawn the primetime serial ""Flamingo Road"", and would debut in 1980 starring Morgan Fairchild.

I know the world outside isn't full of rainbows and happy endings, but to you, aren't we even decent?"" ~from ""The Best of Everything"" (1959)

The more things change, the more they stay the same. When watching ""The Best of Everything"" it is striking how much things have indeed changed from the days when women went to work in offices wearing with hats and gloves to go with their tailored suits, even in the summer. It is interesting how the girls mostly saw the secretarial jobs as something to do while waiting to get married, not as careers. Some of the older executives took liberties which today would result in a lawsuit. On the other hand, the way women allow themselves to be used by men under the guise of romance and independence is an element of the film which finds an echo in our own time.

Based upon the novel by Rona Jaffe, ""The Best of Everything"" deals with the lives of three young women in the jungle of Madison Avenue in the late fifties. Considered scandalous in its time, in some ways it was prophetic of things to come, followed by films such as ""The Apartment"" (1960) and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (1961) about other young females lost in Manhattan. Hope Lange stars as the Ivy League heroine, Caroline Bender who, abandoned by her fianc, has to find a way to occupy her time, so she takes a secretarial job at a publishing house. Of all the girls, she becomes enthralled by the challenge of the work itself and begins to aim for success. She is befriended by Mike Rice (Stephen Boyd) who is one of the few gentlemen in the film, in spite of being a bit of a drunk. He does not take advantage of Caroline when, in a heartbroken and intoxicated state, she throws herself at him. Caroline finds herself turning into her boss, Amanda Farrow, played with ferocity by Joan Crawford. Miss Farrow is an independent, powerful executive whom Caroline aims to be and yet, like the other young women, dreads to emulate. Miss Farrow has a glamorous and successful life but no domesticity, which the trio of heroines, whether they want to admit it or not, all long for. Caroline has to decide whether she wants to devote herself totally to glittering success, with uncommitted lovers on the side, or whether she wants to make the compromises demanded by marriage.

Caroline's friend April (Diane Baker) is the type of girl who hardly exists anymore, a total innocent. Even the guidance of her slightly more savvy friends cannot deliver her from the seductions of wealthy playboy Dexter, the absolute creep of the movie. April thinks she has found a great romance but in the end, as she says from her hospital bed, ""Now I'm just another person who has had an affair.""

Suzy Parker, who was a model and Dorian Leigh's sister, plays the most truly modern heroine, Gregg, of whom there are legions of contemporary counterparts. In her quest to become an actress, Gregg works as a secretary to support herself, but otherwise she wants nothing more from life than fun. The product of a broken home, Gregg, with zesty independence, is willing to play the field in the same way as the men, no strings attached. When she does fall in love, she casts all ambition, dignity, and self-respect aside to become the obsessed handmaid of her lover. When her boyfriend, a Broadway director portrayed by Louis Jourdan, tires of her, Gregg is shattered. Some commentators have said that the Gregg's breakdown is a bit too melodramatic. However, having witnessed friends in the past go through similar anguish, I would hesitate to say that her mental state is entirely far-fetched.

By the end of the film, marriage with a respectable man looks almost too good and too unattainable to be true. Ultimately, it is what the heroines were all striving for in their own way, along the crooked paths of modernity, which promise success and sex without enduring love and happiness.",1228867200,3,4018,4.6775106082036775

709512,4,6303662544,"""The Best of Everything"" is a classic 1959 romantic melodrama featuring the best talent: Joan Crawford, Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, directed by Jean Negulesco, an Oscar-nominated title song sung by Johnny Mathis, and a beautiful score by Alfred Newman. Based on a novel by Rona Jaffe, it is the story of 5 young girls working their way up the steno pool at a publishing firm in New York City. The movie mainly focuses on these 3: Gregg (Parker) who really wants to be an actress, April (Baker) who wants to find Mr. Right, and Caroline (Lange) the main heroine, who initially is just working until her fiance comes back to marry her. Once the fiance unceremoniously dumps her, Caroline becomes a little bitter and decides to climb her way up to the top and replace her boss, the bitchy Amanda Farrow (Joan Crawford). Most of the men in this movie are heels; Louis Jordan plays a theatrical director who Gregg falls in love with, and Robert Evans is a rich playboy who only wants to fool around with April, not marry her. Brian Aherne is the lecherous yet somehow likeable boss of the firm who can't keep his hands off the ladies. Stephen Boyd plays a handsome office drunk who somewhat secretly carries the torch for Caroline.

Although the story is a little over the top and of course somewhat predictable, and many will find offense with its less-than positive view on the female role in society, but one must remember that this is a snapshot of the period in which this movie was made. And what a snapshot! The acting is top notch; Crawford gives the character of Amanda Farrow much depth; although we see her bitchy office personna, we also hear her behind-closed-doors phone call to the married man that she loves deeply but is unable to spend time with because she will always be second-rate to him. Crawford is able to generate a level of sympathy for a character that easily could have been 100% rotten. Hope Lange is just glowing in this movie; she is the core of the trio; the one girl who we know in the end will make the best decisions and stick to her moral code. Diane Baker convincingly plays a naive girl who just wants to fall in love, and it is easy to believe her wide-eyed innocence. Suzy Parker is just gorgeous with her mane of red hair cascading all over the place.

The widescreen picture and sound are excellent; the colors jump off the screen. This disc features a commentary track that alternates between author Rona Jaffe and film historian Sylvia Stoddard. Each one gives excellent details on the production.

I was disappointed to see the similarities between this movie and her other book ""the roomating season"". Accidental death of character, married men and adultery, broken big city dreams. There was no real originality maybe I should have read this one before the other but the premise was the same. Lose of youth and innocence to the cruelties of city life.

709514,4,6303662544,"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking booze-hounds with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, pass way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack. I want to jump right into some scenes, filmed on N.Y. streets, circa 1959 & experience a time I've only seen on film & in photographs. Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith's ""Working Girl."" Especially when Hope Lange (who's a cross between Grace Kelly & Dolores Hart) gets bombed in handsome Stephen Boyd's apartment, he tucks her in & just watches her sleep (like Melanie, she wants to know if ""anything"" happened between them the following day). Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to Sigourney Weaver's horrible female boss except she was outwardly nasty (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was sweet on the outside & horrible on the inside. I found it distressing how the Suzy Parker character (Gregg) started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress, who supposedly didn't need a man to complete her, ended up. She becomes a stalker/lunatic/nut-job when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her bananas after he's done with her. I loved the character Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her thick New Yawk accent. If you enjoy films like ""Valley Of The Dolls"", ""Where The Boys Are"", & ""Come Fly With Me"" you'll like this one too. (BTW I don't know why Joan Crawford is on the cover of this DVD! Her role is small, much like Susan Hayward's in ""Valley of The Dolls"". Here's alittle bit of trivia: Hope Lange & Diane Baker stroll down Christopher Street chatting about 30 minutes into the film. In the background you can see The Stonewall Inn bar, where the gay liberation movement began in the late 60's with the Stonewall riots).",1177891200,8,2135,4.772972972972973

This is a glossy soap opera of sorts, which reminds me a lot of films like ""Peyton Place,"" and ""Valley of the Dolls.""  The best scenes in the movie, however, are the ones with ""bitch boss"" Ms Farrow (played wonderfully by screen legend Joan Crawford).  In one memorable scene Joan is on the telephone with her lover, who won't leave his wife for her, so Joan screams into the phone: ""You and your rabbit faced wife can go straight to hell!"" Classic!  And the funny thing is she slams the phone down before she completely finishes her sentence! Hilarious!

Caroline is torn between her dreamy ex-fiance Eddie Harris (Bret Halsey ""Return to Peyton Place"" (1961) and office hunk Mike Rice (Stephen Boyd ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964) while moving swiftly up the corporate ladder and into Ms Farrow's office!  Gregg Adams wants to become the toast of Broadway by allowing herself to fall into the hands (and the bed) of the play's director, David Savage (Louis Jourdan ""Gigi"" (1958) which ends in tragedy.  April is seduced by rich and suave Dexter Key (Robert Evans) and believes after she tells him that she is pregnant, they are off to be married -sorry, another tragedy!  It seems Ms Farrow has come to her senses and is giving up the glamorous life for the married life -but then she returns to the office for her old job and says, ""it's just too late for me.""  Caroline comes to her senses and realizes she must give up her dream of winning back Eddie and she and Mike go walking together down the busy New York streets as the credits roll.

709620,4,6303662544,"I first watched this movie because cinamatic legand Joan Crawford was one of the stars in it. Joan plays Amanda Farrow, a rather bossy publishing executive. However, her part is small and the movie has little to do with her character. It's a fine picture, though.

At first glance, ""The Best of Everything"" looks like ""9 to 5"" meets ""The Devil Wears Prada."" But after the first twenty minutes I was convinced that this was a much more complicated tale about relationships taking place in the Big Apple.

The main plot focused on three clerical workers at the same publishing firm, played by Hope Lange, Diane Baker, and Suzy Parker. Each women has their own trials and tribulations. But I think the one thing that they all have in common is that the men in their lives are all cads. I would say that just about all the men in this film are rather unsympathetic and uncaring. Is this how men really were in the 1950's? I hope not.

Normally I'd reserve two maybe three stars for a picture like this. But since it's Joan's ""last great picture"" (not counting ""Baby Jane,"" of course) it deserves four.",1157328000,18,1097,4.558375634517766

709625,5,6303662544,"Nice movie about an office in the pre-feminist era... 1959 early 60's.  Almost all the men in this picture were either boozers or just total DOGS!  Often the men were both boozers and dogs.  Ths movie had such bad stereotypes of old boy sexual harrassment that it likely could not be made today.  The thing that shocks me most about this movie is that it got made at all.  I mean this movie talks openly about shallow self absorbed rich boys who tell ladies whatever they want or need to hear just to go all the way with them.  Then when a baby results they force the young lady of now soiled virtue to sneak off to some back alley abortionist.

In this case the young lady in question bolted but not without losing the baby rseolving the rich jerks issue.  Of course this was a 1950's era movie so all the bad girls had to meet somewhat tragic ends or be scared for life.  The star of the picture is dutifully rewarded at the end of the picture by seeming to achieve the beginnings of a beautiful friendship with a co-equal at work after reaching success in business.  She is last seen leaving her office for the night having won the respect of the typing pool ladies from which she came.  She makes firends with the office sour puss, who finds weird solace in the arms of the booze hound womanizer, who I suspect has a rabbit faced wife.

The movie ends with her finding solace in the arms of a hard drinking but lovable clod of a co-worker.  Is the acting wooden for the most part you bethcha. Joan Crawford really did carry this picture.  Her few moments in the picture tried it together in a rather masterful way.  Joan did not have very much actual FACE time on the picture but her small parts had so much power that she stole the show.  If you wanted to see what male sexist pig really means that you must buy this DVD because its all here.  The ladies butt pinching letch boss who is always drunk and thinks nothing of plying nice girls with drink to further his unwholesome causes.

The only thing you can say about the men in this picture is Who Let The DAWG's OUT!  Buy this its funny, serious and well done on many different levels.",1139702400,,2144,4.301745635910224

709678,4,6303662544,"There are some wonderful reasons to add the newly released-on-DVD ""The Best of Everything"" to your film library. For one, it is a glittering and colorful glimpse into New York City circa 1959. Fox certainly has done a commendable job with the DVD--the picture quality and sound are both crystal clear. Cinemascope has rarely been this fun to watch, because now one can see it digitally mastered in widescreen with vivid color photography by Deluxe brought to sparkling life.

The film is very, very lush. From the beginning, when the screen fills with a sunny view of the Manhattan skyline to the sounds of Johnny Mathis crooning the Oscar-nominated theme song, you know you are in for grand entertainment. All of the performances are fine, with Crawford a standout.

I think it's funny that although Joan Crawford only has five to ten minutes of screen time in ""The Best of Everything,"" her picture is featured very prominently on the back and front covers of the DVD. The casual watcher may never know that the ultimate movie star had a only a supporting role, yet with that tiny role she managed to steal the entire picture and make it her own!  That's star power!

As enjoyable as the film is, it is incredibly flawed. If one was interested in sexist attitudes (concerning men AND women) and how they have changed since the 1950s, there couldn't be a more relevant movie to watch. It is shocking, and sometimes disturbing, how much attitudes have changed.

For example, at one point during the movie, Catherine (played by lovely Hope Lange) is told by David, one of her romantic interests, that once she has proven to herself she can make it in the publishing world (which, in his view, could be the only reason a woman might have some kind of ambition) she should quit it all, get married, and ""love happily ever after."" Now there is nothing wrong with wanting to be in love happily ever after, but it certainly represents a double-standard. Who would ever tell a man such a thing?  Could you imagine Hope Lange telling David that a man's ambition is only him trying to prove himself, and that he should cut it out and love happily ever after? (now I can imagine Joan Crawford saying that to Clark Gable, but there weren't any characters with that kind of will or independence in this film).

So much of the dialogue and morality in the film is dated, and some of it is very disturbing, but there are still some good things about the story. There are some great viewpoints on love, and how casual dating and hookups can hurt people, and my favorite line has to be, ""Here's to men, with their clean-shaven faces and their dirty little minds."" It's funny to say the least!",1117065600,4,2675,4.6308016877637135
709679,5,6303662544,"Yes, please take me back to 1959, to New York in 1959, or even back to Rio de Janeiro, a couple of years before, where I met Rona Jaffe practically every single night at the then world-famous ""Sacha's"" nightclub, where Rona was already drafting her novel mentally...

When the film started shooting the exteriors in front of the Seagram's building, one could actually walk-up to lovely Suzy Parker and chat with her about how real was the ""new morality"" of the liberated New York girls in the executive suites, decades before Sex and the City became the post-mortem of the sexual revolution of the Sixties.

At night we had the many parties thrown by Negulesco and his charming wife, while Stephen Boyd was being charming to my wife, Brazilian actress Mariza Woodward, featured in LIFE Magazine as one of the most beautiful gals in Rio.

If you purchase this looking for the same campy, kitschy experience you get from VOTD, you will, like me, be very disappointed.  This movie was indeed charming and a great look back at how it used to be, but not a camp delight by any means.  Just don't expect something else like I did!",1103500800,10,618,4.857142857142857
709681,4,6303662544,"I am still trying to figure out why I like this film (and so many like it), when in truth, the submissiveness of females and their dependence on the love of a man really sicken me.  The depiction of women in this film is perhaps a bit more progressive than that in other films of this genre, as the women are, at least, ""career women"", and much of the story is set in the office, of a large publishing firm, Fabian Publishing.  However, among the three key friends and principal characters (played by Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, and Diane Baker), Lange's character Caroline Bender is the only one determined to be an editor.  However, at the same time, when her colleague Mike Rice (Stephen Boyd) asks her if she has any ambitions beyond working a year or so, she quite adamantly says ""no..none at all""...so, it's a bit contradictory, and frustrating. And he, of course, says it's ""wonderful"" when she agrees with him that it would be quite satisfying for her to ""get her feet wet in publishing for a year or two to prove what she has ""to prove"", marry a doctor or lawyer, and have babies"".  UGH!!!  But, it's 1959, so, you have to keep it in perspective.

Some of the dialog is beyond hope, but I inexplicably continue to watch this film, every so often.  Maybe it's the women's clothing...I love suits, and I miss dressing up for work.  (Business casual has been one of several downfalls of today's workplace, as far as I'm concerned).  No, but really...perhaps it is because I want to see if at least one of these women wakes up and takes stock in her own life, and throws back all of the garbage that her ""sweetheart"" dishes out at her.  Hope Lange does so to a degree when she rhetorically asks her slime-bucket hometown beau Eddie, in paraphrase, ""what is it about men that they think they deserve the most refined, cultured, ""respectable"" women from the ""best schools and the best families"" only ""part-time"", for only fun, but ignore all of the attendant responsibilities that would turn frolic into long-term, serious relationships.""  She then goes on to say that a number of women will play the same game as men, for a while, but eventually, they'll have to pick up a few extra men of their own, to fill in the time when they're not with the one they really want.  I at least admire her honesty about the pitfalls and emptiness of ""casual dating"" and ""hooking up"".

The opening credits are very nice...Manhattan in the spring/summertime is always glorious.  Though I need to laugh that it's Johnny Mathis singing the title song, ""The Best of Everything"" (I've always thought that he was a very funny singer...he often breaks what should be long-held notes with silence...perhaps he's breathing, but we don't hear him inhale), it's also perfect....who else would be singing this song for a 1950's movie about finding your way in life and in love.

Joan Crawford's boss is in many ways no different from some of the tyrannical maniacs for whom I've had the complete displeasure to work.  Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow was more or less a direct, no holds barred, right-in-your face ""meanie"", telling Hope Lange that she does not have what it takes to become a Reader, much less an Editor.  And, she did it in front of the rest of the typing pool (how unprofessional is that?).  In the 80's, people stabbed you in the back.  In the 90's, and to a degree, now, people smile at you directly, and let you believe all is well, until you're laid off in one life-altering second.

I found it inconsistent how the Suzy Parker character started out as an independent, career-minded, aspiring actress, who prided herself on never having needed a man (""to love, and to let go...that's me""), but ended up becoming the most debilitated by the rejection of a man with whom she had fallen in love.  And of course, it's also amazing how Diane Baker, fresh from being thrown out of a speeding car and losing a baby (out of wedlock, no less, in the 1950's!) manages to attract the attention and heart of a young, studly doctor when she's still wearing bandages and no make-up in her hospital bed.  Wonders never cease in a 1950's melodrama!

If you hedonistically enjoy ""Valley of the Dolls"", or ""Written on the Wind"", you'll love ""The Best of Everything"".",1100908800,8,4241,4.625333333333334

In fact, Amanda is pretty much a direct clone of the large-and-in-charge Joan who told the Pepsico board members ""Don't f--k with me, fellas!"" right around the time this film was shot.
This is a great period piece to watch today.  I love the IBM blue that is omnipresent in the offices, the primitive electric typewriters, the office gossip, the ""girls"" with curlers in their hair, the look of NYC at that time - and let's not even start on the women's clothes (one word - gloves)!!

Being only 23 years old, I can't imagine living in a time where women were confined to only being secretaries or fashion editors when in the working force. I can't imagine being chased around a desk by my boss and constantly being talked down to, pinched, and patronized just because it was what they did back then.
This movie really opened my eyes to what went on the in the working world in the 50's. It was also interesting to see how topics such as sexual harrassment, abortion, dependency (on men), and sex, period were handled approximately 50 years ago. I think this is a good movie for people my age particularly because it gives us a glimpse into what women had to go through so that we now don't have to endure such stupidity.

709685,5,6303662544,"Okay, don't over analyze this film. It is very much a reflection of its generation.

In a juicy, soap-opera-y way, beautifully technicolor way, we get to see the lives of various office ""girls"", i.e. secretaries, biding their time while awaiting the arrival of Mr. Right, or in the case of some young naive girls, Mr. Oh So Wrong! See aspiring actress with a jealous streak and broken heart rummage through X-boyfriend's trash (and I thought I was the only one who did that!), see jilted girlfriend drink one too many and end up in her boss's apartment, where they (gasp!) kiss, see hurt/confused/morally compromised lover leap from moving car and more!  It's all good stuff, if a bit melodramatic and contrived. That's what makes it so bee-you-tee-ful. Well, that and Joan Crawford's eyebrows.  And as always, all the action takes place in fabulous New York, land of opportunity and over-crowded apartments. One of my favorite scenes is the company picnic, and my other favorite spot is the coffee shop located in the lobby of the high rise office building.

709686,5,6303662544,"I saw this film back in 1959 when it first came out and I also read Rona Jaffe's book on which it was based.  It was about the world of New York secretaries.  And it seemed to speak directly to me as I was then working as a secretary for a large management-consulting firm.  I loved it then because it seemed so real.  Now, 44 years later, I'm reminded of that reality.
I remember wearing white gloves and a hat to work each day, even in the summer.  I remember setting my hair in pincurls.  I remember my electric typewriter, which was the latest technological advance.  I was married then and remember being addressed as ""Mrs."" by my boss, even though I was only 19 years old.  All the secretaries had desks next to each other in one open room; it was years before the advent of cubicles made famous by the Dilbert cartoon.  And years before any of my fellow co-workers aspired to anything other than marriage and children. The one female executive was pitied and looked at as a sour old maid.
In the film Joan Crawford is cast as that one office ""witch"", who had not married because she was involved with a married man and was paying for her bad decision.  Indeed, there was more than one married man involved in affairs in the film, but it was always the woman who was made to suffer.  Hope Lange had the role of the young hopeful who, because of being jilted by her boyfriend, starts to achieve some success in business.  Then there is Diane Baker, fresh faced and innocent at the beginning, but whose life is almost ruined by the wrong man.  Most pitiful of all though is Suzy Parker, who gives up her secretarial job to be an actress and is used and then dropped by an important director.  The men are all cads with the exception of Stephen Boyd who accuses Hope Lange of wanting to achieve success because she's afraid of being a ""real woman"".  Brian Ahern is a lecher who is always pinching the girls; their reaction though is typical of the times --they just laugh it off and don't take him seriously.  Robert Evans is a seducer with no morals.  And Louis Jourdan is the director who keeps a girl around only for as long as she amuses him.
This is a film that could never have be made today.  All the women are secretaries.  All the men are bosses.  Everyone is white and middle class.  They all have the same values.  However, in spite of all that, it is a really good story.  It moves fast and held my interest throughout.  And the acting is quite good.  In a limited way I found myself really caring about the characters.  I really do know people who were just like those depicted on the screen.  Therefore, I recommend this video - even if it's for no other reason to see what life was like back in 1959.",1044144000,112,2718,4.330693069306931

But back then it was part of the job.  Even the lone women boss, Joan Crawford, was a b*tch.  There is one main protagonist -- Hope Lange -- but the story also follows her two friends.  Interestingly, the rack of old paperbacks in the office, many are selling for big bucks on EBAY nowadays.",1525824000,,463,4.287356321839081

7853237,5,6303662544,I leaned ALOT from this movie. I was a very young 12 yr old when I first saw it --- but it had a lasting impression on me.  I guess the most important thing I learned from this movie was to not be naive and let any guy take advantage of me ---because grief and personal regret was right around the corner.  I stuck to that philosophy and it served me well. I love looking at the street scenes of New York City from the late '50s. All the women were beautiful --- especially Suzy Parker ---- and oh that RED DRESS. You don't see that kind of class and good taste any more. The plot of the movie is not rocket science but a simple enjoyable story with a simple but worthwhile message.,1510272000,,682,4.082089552238806
7853238,5,6303662544,An amazing movie- if you loved Mad Men you will love this. Great movie but thrilled that the office environment depicted has been put into the past where it belongs,1505433600,,164,4.5
