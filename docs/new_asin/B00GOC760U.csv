6094858,5,B00GOC760U,"I grew up watching this show and will forever be a fan of it. The first three seasons with all the original cast members is the best. I still like and watch the other seasons, just not as much. I knew I had to have them in my collection of old sitcoms. I have many more shows to get but this one definitely tops the list.

I got all three season at a great price with fast shipping and the items were in great (new) condition. I am very pleased with my purchas.

Thanks Amazon for keeping some great memories of this show alive!",1401148800,2,528,4.0673076923076925

6094876,3,B00GOC760U,"You get 3 discs in this set, Season 1 on one disc and Season 2 spread out over 2 discs.

The quality of the recordings isn't that great and seems to suffer from compression issues (which is what happens when you try to cram so much onto so few discs), and starting with Season 2 there seems to be no ""break"" in the chapters when the show would have gone to commercial, so you can skip through the opening song but then must go through the entire show before the credits roll with no chapter breaks.",1428969600,3,498,4.1875
6094877,5,B00GOC760U,"Just bought this set, the strongest two seasons of the show. John Amos and Esther Rolle's chemistry was essential to the ""reality"" of the show, which, while very funny, also detailed the pitfalls and dangers of living in the (unnamed) Cabrini projects of Chicago.( Even in the 70s, several characters express disbelief that the father is still around to head and discipline an African-American family). As others have stated, Amos' departure in the fourth season turned the show into a more generic situation comedy, but there are enough good episodes in the third and fourth season to make a purchase of that set worthwhile, as well. It's interesting that Amos' leaving the show, and it's weakening thereof, could be a metaphor for a father leaving a family, weakening its bond in the process. But as long as Amos is on screen, Good Times has a tough, dangerous edge that was never duplicated after he left.",1427500800,2,908,4.864516129032258

Sitcoms from this era were funny, decently acted and Good Times actually had some moral and ethical messages to it that added to the humor.  Esther Rolle who played the mother was the key to this series and this first two seasons, she was strong and at her best!  If you liked Good Times growing up or missed growing up with it and want to discover it for the first, time get this set...you won't be disappointed!",1425081600,,570,4.154545454545454

6094885,5,B00GOC760U,"This DVD set has a very high quality without missing a moment of the hilarious and often funny Evans family in the 1970s project apartment of Chicago, Illinois. Esther Rolle (formerly Florida Evans on Maude) and her husband, James Evans Sr. (John Amos) live in a two bedroom apartment with their three children; J.J. (played by the standup comic Jimmie Walker); Thelma (played by Bernnadette Stanis); and Michael Evans (Ralph Carter who left the ""Raisin"" musical). Then there is Willona Woods, the Rona Barrett of the projects played by Janet DuBois.

This Norman Lear sitcom wasn't always full of Good Times. The first three seasons had James Evans Sr. played by John Amos. This version on DVD has both seasons in a wonderful high quality and unfortunately there is no extras such as the background story behind the scenes. Esther Rolle and John Amos were perfect and ideal as parents. It didn't hurt that they had chemistry as well. Florida and James Sr. managed to convey a strong family home for their growing children. The last three seasons were never so good or done well.

The biggest mistake for this series was letting John Amos go in the fourth season. Esther Rolle left by the end of the fourth and returned for the final season. Still, the first three seasons were stellar and groundbreaking.",1419811200,5,1305,4.821428571428571

8625395,5,B00GOC760U,"Some years ago I read a PLAYBOY interview with Snoop Dog, who said that when he was locked up in county jail for dealing drugs many years ago, there was tension between the black and white inmates over control of the television. The blacks, he said, wanted to watch shows like GOOD TIMES, whereas the whites ""weren't feeling that."" I remember reading that passage and thinking to myself, ""Huh? What?"" You see, I'm white, I grew up in the 70s - 80s and GOOD TIMES was a staple of my television diet. I thought it was one of the best-acted and funniest shows on TV and after watching the first two seasons again after an interval of 30-odd years, my opinion hasn't changed. This show is (you knew this was coming ) DY-NO-MITE!!!

GOOD TIMES is the story of the Evans family, poor black folks who live in a cramped, run-down apartment in a project building on Chicago's South Side. The family is led by tough, hot-tempered patriarch James (John Amos); his loving wife Florida (Esther Rolle); their pigeon-walking oldest son J.J. (Jimmie Walker), their lovely good-girl daughter Thelma (Bernadette Stanis), and feisty militant tweenager Michael (Ralph Carter). They are frequently joined by sassy neighbor Wilona Woods (Janet Dubois) and, beginning in season two, tormented by sleazy, greedy building super Nathan Bookman (Johnny Brown). The show revolves mainly around the many challenges the family faces due to their social status: money woes, racism, crime, inter-family disputes, ""temporary layoffs,"" second-rate schools, and the situation of America generally in the mid-1970s: inflation, stagnation, gas shortages and unemployment. Though the show had as many heavy-handed ""message"" episodes of any sit-com during that era, it was brutally frank in the way it tackled many subjects and the writing was, in addition to being damned funny, often extremely edgy. The Evans' clan spoke its mind, and it spoke its mind in the language of the street.

Now, as a rule, I confess I am not a huge fan of sit-coms. I can think of maybe a half a dozen I consider really funny and timeless, but I can honestly say that GOOD TIMES makes me laugh out loud. The acting, particularly by John Amos and Esther Rolle, is usually excellent, and unless you are a flat-out liar you must admit that Jimmie Walker's strutting, loud-mouth antics will have you in stitches. In fact, all the characters are very well defined, even those like Thelma and Michael, who have less to do than the rest of the cast, and Janet Dubois, who generally gets only one real scene an episode. And for a show which is set about 90 - 95% of the time in a tiny apartment, there is a remarkable diversity of storyline. Some of my favorites from this two-season set include:

Black Jesus: J.J. creates drama when he paints a portrait of black Jesus; especially when his religious mother discovers who his model for her Lord and Savior really was.

Michael Gets Suspended: Michael, the ""militant midget,"" outrages his conservative father by getting suspended for making insulting comments about George Washington.

Sex and the Evans Family: James is in full boil mode when he discovers what he thinks is a ""sex book"" in the hands of his beloved baby girl, Thelma.

The Encyclopedia Hustle: a blind salesman (Ron Glass) tricks the Evans' family into buying a ""black encyclopedia"" they cannot afford.

The Gang: Part 1 & 2: In an episode alternatively funny and dramatic, J.J. is ""recruited"" into a street gang on the brink of war with its rival.

The Windfall: When James ""does the right thing"" and returns money to a bank which was stolen in a robbery, the consequences are not what he expected.

The Nude: J.J. is commissioned to paint a married woman...in the buff. Mom and dad aren't so keen on it, and neither is her husband (Carl Weathers).

The Debutante Ball: when J.J. falls for a lovely socialite, he encounters not racism, but classicism, when her (black) parents decide he's not good enough.

The Houseguest: An old friend of James drops by with baggage both physical and metaphorical that puts the whole Evans family in danger.

The Enlistment: When James loses his job, J.J. enlists in the Army to help his family with their finances (guest starring William Christopher).

The Lunch Money Ripoff: Michael brings home his bully for the weekend in an attempt to make peace. James brings out his belt in an attempt to teach lessons.

GOOD TIMES ran for many years, but John Amos left the show after the third season and the show was never quite the same after that, so for my money, this is almost a ""best of"" and is offered for a very reasonable price. The highest compliment I can give a TV series is to say I will be rewatching, and I can honestly say it won't be too long before I revisit the Evans clan once more. I just have to see season three first.",1527206400,,4822,4.752392344497608
