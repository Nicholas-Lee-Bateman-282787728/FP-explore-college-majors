And it is coming out the same day as the new movie hits DVD.I like the cover with Daisy,now why would Warner not have Coy and Vance on the cover with her?Sorry i'm being dumb! I know everybody hated Coy and Vance! But I'm looking forward to seeing there episodes,I never scene them all. I hope Bryon Cherry and Christopher Mayer will be included on the special features section if there is any?I would like to here what the 2 stars have to say?Well I'm looking forward to season 5 on DVD!

Are taking them off so they said this season had bad ratings and that is what cancelled the show well i don't think so.,1436140800,,457,4.032967032967033

2410511,2,B000BB1MJ6,"Ok, it's been several years since I last saw this show, so most of my review is straight from memory; but I feel my memory is correct in its opinion. I was such a huge fan of this show in its intial run back when I was a teenager. Watched it pretty faithfully every week, and even caught reruns in the summer.

However, I found my liking of this show come to a dead halt during this, the 5th season. Why? you may ask. Well, I'll tell you:

It's simple. Luke and Bo Duke were no longer on the show. Yep, Tom Wopat and John Schneider left due to contract disputes, or something like that. Anyways, that really wasn't the part that bothered me. No, what bothered me to no end, and rightly so, and something that should bother anyone with half a brain, was that not only had Bo and Luke left the farm, but they were replaced with very generic carbon copies that were excruciatingly bad to look at.

And, what a HUGE insult to the viewer's intelligence here! Wow! Talk about jumping the shark! This mistake was like Jaws jumping Snake River Canyon.

Yes, the producers, writers, directors, whoever was in charge, expected viewers to buy into that not only did Uncle Jesse have yet 2 more nephews to conveniently step into the family household once Luke and Bo flew the coop, but they were also cousins, one dark haired, one blonde, and close as brothers just like Luke and Bo.

Huh? What? Wait! Yeah! That's right! So, all in all, Daisy, Luke, Bo, and the two new generic guys were all cousins, meaning that every one of them had different parents. Made me wonder just how many siblings poor old Uncle Jesse had!

To think I was only about 14 when this season first aired, and I still remember then realizing what a huge insult to the viewing public's intelligence this all was! Yes, I know it was never really a very intellectual show to begin with, and that was part of its charm; but to dumb it down to the lowest denominator was unforgivable in my opinion.

The only reason I give this season two starts (instead of one) is because Enos returned. Loved Enos! And, even with the return of Bo and Luke (who I had the fiercest crush on, and could just sit and stare stupidly at him week after week), I still gave up on this show after this season, because it was never the same again.

Thank you! :>)",1318291200,3,2296,4.348130841121495
2410512,5,B000BB1MJ6,Very good show. It will make you laugh especially the sheriff. If you like a clean decent show then this is the one for you!,1314921600,,124,4.0
2410513,5,B000BB1MJ6,"This season seems to have inspired a lot of wrath among ""Dukes"" fans.  Evidently, the two leads walked out on the show (never a good idea) and were replaced by Byron Cherry and Christopher Mayer (Coy and Vance Duke).  I've heard these actors called ""Luke and Bo wanna-be's"" and ""eye candy,"" which I think is a bit cruel and unfair.  I, for one, feel these actors did as well as could be expected with their roles.  It is true that they were perhaps a bit too ""hunky"" for a series that was meant to present ""good ol' boys"" in all their unrestrained charm.  Nevertheless, just as they were growing more comfortable in their roles, they were unceremoniously dismissed, and the original leads returned (not quite with the same gusto as before).  The character of Cletus also vanishes somewher during this season, which is anoher mistake because he was very funny and endearing.  All that being said, this season's episodes are consistently strong and well-done; ""Hazzard Hustle,"" ""The Dukes Strike it Rich,"" ""Witness: Jesse Duke,"" and ""Big Brothers, the Dukes"" are all excellent episodes.  Let's try to be a little more open, especially now since the beautiful Christopher Mayer is no longer among the living.",1312848000,3,1205,4.872549019607843
2410514,4,B000BB1MJ6,"I enjoyed the Dukes of Hazzard when I was younger. I was a bit preturbed when Bo and Luke decided to sit out a season over money, but I watched the show anyway. Now that I have the dvd I am enjoying it more. The new Duke Boys, Coy and Vance were just as good as the originals. The show is a bit off the beaten path, but fun to watch!",1287014400,3,333,3.704225352112676

2410535,4,B000BB1MJ6,"I have loved the Dukes of Hazzard for a while now. The fifth season is pretty decent with Coy (Byron Cherry) and Vance (Christopher Mayer) Duke. Without the original actors Bo (John Schneider) and Luke (Tom Wopat) Duke for the majority of the season (said to fulfill a life long dream of being in the Nascar Circuit), the season turned out to be better than I thought it would be. The action and drama has been turned up a bit I guess cause they want Coy and Vance get as much action as Bo and Luke did. What's also great is that Enos (Sonny Shroyer) returns from the Los Angeles Police department (really returned from a failed spin off series)to be forced by Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) to chase the Duke boys. For the first few episodes Enos and Cletus (Rick Hurst) team up and have to follow Boss hogg's (Sorrell Booke) commands to nail the Dukes. The sad thing is that Cletus mysteriously disappears with only mentioned in one episode that he went on vacation. Finally, in the episode ""Welcome back Bo and luke"", Bo and Luke successfully return with a win from the Nascar circuit. You will see the fur cousins Coy, Vance, Bo, and Luke, together in this episode only. Overall, I give this a 4/5 star. I would've given it 5 stars if Bo and Luke were in it.

THOSE TWO GOOD LOOKING FELLAS HELPED TO SAVE THIS SHOW FROM OBSCURITY. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOWN BETTER RESPECT.

ALSO I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THEY JUST ""DISAPPEARED"" AS IF THEY WERE NEVER IN THE SERIES. BESIDES, THEY WERE ""RELATIVES"". THAT SHOULD HAVE AUTOMATICALLY INVITED THEM TO COME BACK.

2410541,3,B000BB1MJ6,"The 1982-83 Season of the DUKES OF HAZZARD was a so-so season since it left us mourning the loss of Bo & Luke Duke throughout most of this season since the Dukes 5th Season was when Bo Duke(John Schneider) and Luke Duke(Tom Wopat)were abruptly replaced by their long-lost cousins Coy Duke(Byron Cherry) and Vance Duke(Chris Mayer)throughout most of the Dukes Fifth Season since Schneider & Wopat left the series in the Spring of 1982 due to a salary dispute, but then this show took an abrupt nose-dive which inclined the producers to bring Bo and Luke back to the show in the Spring of 1983.

In addition to what led to a severe cut in ratings for the DUKES OF HAZZARD; the premiere of KNIGHT RIDER in September of 1982 on the same weekend the DUKES OF HAZZARD kicked off its 5th Season with Coy & Vance since KNIGHT RIDER was a big instant smash that had wiped everything out in the ratings ranking at number 2 in the top 10 Nielsen ratings back then along with the fact that Michael & KITT had stole the Dukes thunder practically ruining them & the Knight 2000 had became the hottest car on Friday nights and the General Lee was no longer was, especially since KITT could do 10 times more than the General Lee was ever able to do along with the fact that this show was no longer in its honeymoon phase on top of that while KNIGHT RIDER was just starting its honeymoon phase of that show with its ratings shooting through the roof at an all-time high while the Dukes were sinking to an all-time low.

Therefore, KNIGHT RIDER K.O'd the DUKES OF HAZZARD and nearly led to the DUKES OF HAZZARD's cancellation since the Dukes were going downhill and running out of steam, especially since KITT had obviously outclassed the General Lee causing the General Lee to go out of style and lose its touch making the Dukes & the General Lee pale by comparison resulting in the DUKES OF HAZZARD losing too many viewers from KNIGHT RIDER.

Therefore you could say that Michael & KITT were peaking while the General Lee and the Duke boys were creaking especially since KNIGHT RIDER basically beat the DUKES OF HAZZARD to a pulp, including DALLAS which was on at the same time-slot on CBS as KNIGHT RIDER was on NBC every Friday night which made it kind of interesting to watch the DUKES OF HAZZARD at 8PM on CBS and watching KNIGHT RIDER at 9PM on NBC afterwards even though the Dukes didn't provide nearly as much as excitement as they had during the Dukes first 4 seasons of this show did since KNIGHT RIDER was killing them.

On the other hand, what made the Dukes Fifth Season kind of intriguing was this was also the season when Deputy Enos Strate(Sonny Shroyer) returned to the show after Sonny Shroyer's unsuccessful short-lived spin-off series ENOS fizzled & cancelled by the Spring of 1981 when the Dukes 4th Season was underway, which therefore resulted in Enos going back to Hazzard County to get his old job back as Sheriff Roscoe's fellow deputy replacing Deputy Cletus Hogg(Rick Hurst) eventually, since Cletus was abruptly dropped from the show after the first 5 episodes of the 5th Season, but it was interesting seeing Enos and Cletus working together as partners temporarily, since Cletus had replaced Enos in the 3rd Season when Enos had departed the show after the 2nd Season when Enos moved to California to take a job with the LAPD, but I always preferred Enos to Cletus, since Enos was never as clutzy as Cletus was and was usually more cooperative with the Dukes than Cletus ever was too along with the fact that it was kind of interesting seeing other Duke relatives driving and handling the General Lee too.

I also used to get a kick out watching Cletus and Enos fighting over who would get to drive the patrol car they were sharing and who would get to do what during Cletus's last 4 episodes, but for some reason they never explained how or why Cletus left the show all of the sudden after Cletus made his last appearance in the ""Big Daddy"" episode, but had only mentioned Cletus's name once after his sudden departure from the show in ""The Hazzardgate Tape"" episode when Roscoe had criticized Enos for being incompetent ever since Cletus was on vacation, but Cletus was never mentioned again after that as if Cletus never even existed and was never even part of the show in Enos's absence during the 3rd and 4th Seasons.

Unfortunately the Bo and Luke Duke wannabes(Coy & Vance Duke) didn't have what it took to make this show work, just like it was for Ponch and Joh on CHiPs when Ponch(Erik Estrada) left CHiPs in it's 5th Season temporarily, due to a salary dispute and then when Jon(Larry Wilcox)left the show and got replaced by Ponch's new rookie hot-dog partner Officer Bobby Nelson(Tom Reilly)in CHiPs 6th Season, since Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada didn't get along very well in real life behind the set.

Therefore, NBC ended up cancelling CHiPs after it's 1982-83 Season, since the ratings on CHiPs had toppled when Jon left the show in the Spring of 1982, plus the producers of CHiPs ended up bringing Ponch back permanently when the ratings started going downhill on CHiPs after showing 3 episodes without Ponch while world famous athlete(Bruce Jenner) briefly joined the cast on CHiPs as Jon's interim partner trying to help save the show by temporarily replacing Ponch when Erik Estrada(Ponch) abruptly left CHiPs temporarily due to a salary dispute, but Steve McLeisch only lasted 6 episodes and only his first 3 co-starring episodes subbing in Ponch's absence.

Therefore, the producers of CHiPs were inclined to bring Ponch back permanently by bringing Erik Estrada back with an agreeable salary with the abrupt departure of Bruce Jenner(Steve)in the Winter of 1982 when it became apparent that Wilcox didn't want to do the show anymore.

In other words, CBS had to use the same strategy with the DUKES OF HAZZARD that NBC had to use with CHiPs, since the DUKES OF HAZZARD wasn't the same at all without Bo and Luke and CHiPs wasn't the same without Ponch and Jon, since Bo and Luke were the soul support for the DUKES OF HAZZARD and Ponch and Jon were the soul support for CHiPs.

As a matter of fact, it just so coincidentally happens that the year Bo and Luke were replaced by Coy and Vance on the DUKES OF HAZZARD was the same year Jon got replaced by Bobby on CHiPs as Ponch's new partner, which made both shows plummett in the ratings, except the old Dukes returned in the second half of the Dukes 5th Season, but Jon never returned to CHiPs even though it was going down the toilet with no other hope left to improve the show, which was very similar to what resulted in BUCK ROGERS and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA cancelling after their 2nd Seasons.

It was also interesting seeing Richard Moll on this show before his baliff(Bull Shannon) days on NIGHT COURT getting beat up by Bo and Luke in the ""Daisy's Shotgun Wedding"" episode along with the fact that the ratings on this show surged back up big time when Bo and Luke returned to Hazzard County, which certainly helped save the show.

It's just too bad Jon Baker(Larry Wilcox) couldn't return to CHiPs in it's Sixth Season when the ratings on CHiPs went downhill when they replaced Jon with that Jon Baker wannabe Bobby Nelson(Tom Reilly), because I think the ratings would've gone back up if they'd brought Jon back to the show and got rid of Bobby later, but it wasn't bound to happen since Erik Estrada(Ponch)and Larry Wilcox(Jon)didn't get along in real life, just like Fred Dryer(Hunter)and Stephanie Kramer(McCall) didn't get along in real life on the police drama HUNTER, which was why Stephanie Kramer departed that show after Hunter's 6th Season and got replaced by Hunter's new partner LAPD Sgt. Joanne Molenski(Darlanne Fluegel) in Hunter's 7th Season, which eventually got replaced abruptly by Hunter's last partner Los Angeles police Sgt. Christine Novak(Lauren Lane) in the Winter of 1991 before HUNTER was cancelled in the Summer of 1991, due to weakening ratings.

This 1982-83 Season of the Dukes also had an interesting bonus feature with creator(Gy Waldron) explaining why the old Dukes left the show in the first place after the Dukes 4th Season, which was due to John Schneider(Bo) and Tom Wopat(Luke) feeling mistreated by the producers on this show and feeling overworked, which was why they left the show and why the producers had Bo and Luke replaced with new co-stars Byron Cherry(Coy) and Christopher Mayer(Vance)in the Fall of 1982, but that Gy Waldron had ended up bringing the old Dukes back, since the ratings started to flop in the 5th Season when Coy and Vance took over the show which nearly led to show being put on the chopping-block in the Winter of 1983, but the ratings surged back up when they brought Bo and Luke back to the show in the second half of the 1982-83 Season, which was quite an interesting documentary on this show and this season by the way.

It was also interesting seeing
*William Russ in ""The New Dukes"" episode before his co-starring days on BOY MEETS WORLD

*Andy Robinson in ""The Treasure Of Soggy Marsh"" episode after his co-starring days on RYANS HOPE

*Judson Scott in the ""Witness Jesse Duke"" episode after his co-starring days on the short-lived series THE PHOENIX

*Shawn Weatherly in the ""Coy Vs. Vance"" episode before her co-starring days as Jill Riley on the original BAYWATCH

*Richard Moll in the ""Daisy's Shotgun Wedding"" episode before his co-starring days as Bull Shannon on NIGHT COURT

*Noble Willingham in the ""Witness Jesse Duke"" episode before his co-starring days on WALKER TEXAS RANGER

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when I lived in my hometown(El Centro, CA) since the Imperial Valley is where I lived all my childhood years at which was another reason why I used to always look forward to watching the Dukes on CBS every Friday night back then, since the Imperial Valley is evidently a ridiculously hot and boring place with basically nothing to do for fun or entertainment.

This 1982-1983 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was our president.

Overall, I would have to say the 1982-83 Season of the Dukes was somewhat of an interesting season, but not as good as the first 4 seaons.",1216771200,2,10300,4.685287610619469
2410542,5,B000BB1MJ6,"I think too much was made of the confederate symbol on the General Lee in the new movie.  The Dukes of Hazzard was a simple, good natured show, funny, and I'm sure nothing was meant by using the symbol and didn't have anything to do with slavery and blacks.  The characters were great and well acted, and the stunt driving was awesome and still stands up today.",1185667200,2,361,4.373134328358209
2410543,5,B000BB1MJ6,"Like all the other seasons of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" this one is just pure entertainment at its best.

Coy and Vance just can't reach them and I was so glad when the two good ol' boys finally returned.

I only hope that the two reunion movies will also be released on DVD very soon,because I just can't get enough of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"".

A tip for all people who loves the show as much as I do:If you really are a fan of the original TV show ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" than go and watch John 'Bo Duke` Schneider`s new movie ""Collier & Co - Hot Pursuit"" which is currently running in a couple of cinemas for only a short time.

It's funny and full of action. Keeps my eyes glued to the screen.",1168473600,2,125,4.0
2410556,4,B000BB1MJ6,"Okay, let me start by saying, that as a kid, watching (and loving) The Dukes of Hazzard, this season killed me. Without Bo and Luke, in my mind, there was no Dukes of Hazzard and that feeling was reinforced by this DVD set.

With stars Tom Wopat (Luke) and John Schneider (Bo) in a contract dispute with the show's producers, the powers that be decided to go out and find a couple of replacement parts if you will, for the General Lee. What they came up with was Vance (Christopher Mayer) and Coy (Byron Cherry). It was obvious they were going for look-alikes to play the other set of Duke cousins, as opposed to finding the best actors, because these guys were certainly not the best actors. Then again, the Dukes of Hazzard was never known for being a showcase for Oscar-caliber acting.

As the fifth season began, viewers learned that Bo and Luke were heading off to race on the NASCAR circuit, at the time not nearly the juggarnaut it is today. Of course what seems strange to me watching now (though it didn't strike me as a little kid) is that the Duke boys were on parole, which meant they couldn't leave Hazzard County. Remember all those times with Sheriff Little chasing the boys for being parole breakers? If that's the case, how could they leave Hazzard to race and when they return still be on parole? A good question that never really gets answered.

With Bo and Luke gone, Vance and Coy show up and take over the 1969 Dodge Charger known as the General Lee. They move onto the Duke farm with Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle) and cousin Daisy (Catherine Bach). And while the two main characters are different, many of the stories remain the same.

The Dukes find themselves in the middle of many of Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane's (James Best) sticky messes. The ""law"" of Hazzard County certainly isn't the fine upstanding type, but deep down, both the sheriff and Boss Hogg are decent people, as we see in an episode where Uncle Jesse is blinded while foiling a robbery and the pair are genuinely sympathetic.

Of course Vance and Coy have to find ways to spoil Boss Hogg's schemes and through 18 episodes, the ""new"" Dukes do just that, teaming with mechanic Cooter Davenport (Ben Jones), Daisy and Jesse to keep Hazzard County on the straight and narrow. Pretty much it's the same old thing in Hazzard County: Boss Hogg and Rosco try to swindle people and the Dukes put a stop to it. Of course Boss and Rosco always find bad guys to pin the blame on.

Then, in episode 19, Bo and Luke triumphantly return to Hazzard, fresh off a big win on the NASCAR circuit and ready to settle back into their lives in the sleepy Georgia county. And Boss and Rosco continue to try and swindle residents. Some things never change.

There was however another change in season five. Deputy Enos Strait returned from (failed) spin-off land in California and assumes his role with the police department, teaming with fellow deputy Cletus Hogg for the first part of the season. That is, until Cletus mysteriously disappears, with no real explanation given, except for a mention of a vacation in one episode. Again, another question that doesn't really get answered.

This should have been a great season for extras. It would have been nice to hear about what the cast thought of the changes around them, what the stars were looking for, how producers went about replacing them, how the fan reaction led to them returning. Unfortunately this is not discussed at all in the extras. There is a reunion of stunt personnel and a tour of Cooter's Place, a Dukes memorabilia store. These aren't bad extras, but it really would've been nice to have an inside look at just what happened in season five.

Overall, I can't give this too bad a rating, because there are extras, and the quality of the reproduction seems good, especially for an older show. And really, I can't rate anything that has Waylon Jennings too bad anyway.",1159228800,6,3932,4.613733905579399
2410557,4,B000BB1MJ6,"I didn't know what I was going to find when I purchased this season. I'd heard that Bo & Luke had been replaced by Coy & Vance Duke and I admit I was skeptical at first, but it turned out they did a pretty good job playing the cousins of Bo & Luke who have come down to help Uncle Jessi and Daisy on the farm while Bo & Luke are away racing Nascars (tho one thing that doesnt make sense is that is that they where out of there probation zone)

Cpy and Vance are supposed to be the cousins who grew up on the Duke farm with them but moved away a few years back for something. And they are just as well known to Hazzard as Bo and Luke. I'm not sure i liked them in the first episode but as the eipsodes progressed I got used to them and thought it was a real shame that when Bo & Luke return they are gone so quickly to go help a sick aunt somewhere. I really thought they shouldve all stuck around for at least one episode and worked together to solve something, but they where never mentioned ever again which is a shame. There isn't even any bonus features with them or anything.

The bonus features arnt much, if you're interested in the stunt team reunion where they sit around and talk about the stuff they did or Cooter showing you around the Duked Of Hazzard Museum with a bunch of collectables and things from the show then you might enjoy them but they aint much.

I enjoyed going back to Hazzard for this season where there has to be the worlds highest rate for blown out tyres and police cars crashing every day, not to forget they don't biuld cars like them squad cars anymore, if you end up driving into a pond, all you need to do is call for a toe truck to pull you out and your car will run just fine once its out of the water! But thats just the fun of the Dukes Of Hazzard where saving the day only requires jumping over a few things in the General Lee and stopping crooks who cant shift into reverse... that might seem strange to you and me, but not for the folks there, thats just a normal day in Hazzard.",1155427200,5,2023,4.0525
2410558,4,B000BB1MJ6,"Why no interviews with the actors who played Coy or Vance. I knocked this set down a star because of it. I know the ""Replacment Dukes"" are not exactly popular with the fans but that doesn't mean they didn't do the best job they could. To their credit they didn't try to be Bo and Luke copies but carved out personalities of their own. When Bo and Luke return in episode 19, Coy and Vance are dumped a little too quickly. I would of liked to see the four cousins team-up at least once. After this episode you never hear of Coy and Vance again. I guess they got banned to ""TV Limbo"" with Richie Cunnigham's brother Chuck. I don't think this boads well for a future DVD release of the ""Dukes"" cartoon, which as Coy and Vance as the main charecters in the first 13 of the 21 episodes in the series. In episode 21 of this season, the main villian is a woman named ""L.S. Pritchard"" from Dallas, TX. Think a female J.R. Ewing. She wants to strip-mine Hazzard for coal. I wonder if this wasn't an aborted attempt for a Dallas-Dukes crossover. Did this charecter ever show up on Dallas? After all, the Dukes did crossover with ""Alice"" in October of 1983 (I hope that episode of Alice is included as an extra in the Dukes season six DVD realease). Anyway this season wasn't as bad as some people remember. At least Enos returns (but Cleatus is banished to the same TV limbo as Coy and Vance.)",1143849600,12,1382,4.319230769230769

2410562,5,B000BB1MJ6,"I was skeptical about Coy & Vance being in Season 5 of the Dukes; but I give them major credit for holding down the fort, with the original Duke Boys being absent (I don't understand why they didn't have Byron Cherry & Christopher Mayer express their feelings about being a part of the show on the DVD (Or even having a voiceover), but it is what it is). Rosco & Boss Hogg were at their absolute funniest (Same with Enos & Cletus), and their comedic antics really made up for the absence of Wopat & Schneider (as well as the stunts, there were a lot of those.).

The episodes I enjoyed the most, were ""The New Dukes"", ""Dukes Strike It Rich"", ""Revenge Of Hughie Hogg"", ""Witness: Jesse Duke"", ""Daisy's Shotgun Wedding"", ""Big Brothers, Duke"", ""Coy Vs. Vance"", ""Treasure of Soggy Marsh"", ""Ding Dong: The Boss Is Dead"".

I definitely recommend this DVD for all Dukes of Hazzard fans out there; I'm also happy that Warner Bros. decided to release this 5th season of Dukes on DVD, even though Wopat & Schneider weren't there for the majority of it.

I'm looking forward to the remaining seasons being released on DVD.",1135814400,4,1110,4.567839195979899
2410563,5,B000BB1MJ6,"Another good season,and a MUST BUY recommendation,however,one is left wondering......WHY didn't WB do a featurette on Coy and Vance...or at least have them do an episode voice over? They aren't the bad guys they have been made out to be....and watching these episodes shows that they got better over time. Actually,with the return of Bo and Luke,there was not the massive improvement you'd think there would be...so...that proves that Coy and Vance held their own fairly well...even though they relied on more General Lee stunts and Uncle Jesse/Daisy dialogue to shore up their ""weakness"".

I think the facial expression of Christopher Mayer when Bo and Luke return says a lot...talk about not cracking a smile...he knew his big role was over,taken back by 2 guys who stiffed WB and their fans over some money. Waltzing back into Hazzard like nothing ever happened....greed will do strange things to people....I don't think Coy and Vance would have ever done anything of the kind (of course they didn't have the leverage Tom and John had),seems to me they were just glad to have the job. I think if Warner Bros had realized that,we would have had a Byron Cherry/Christopher Mayer appearance on the Season 5 DVD.",1135641600,7,1211,4.9655172413793105
2410573,5,B000BB1MJ6,"Yes, 5 stars. There has simply never been another show on television like THE DUKES OF HAZZARD...and I doubt we will ever see something in its style again.  But just because John Schneider and Tom Wopat (""Bo and Luke Duke"") are absent on just about every episode of this season, doesn't mean that I will wait longer to purchase it.

In hindsight, the introduction of ""Coy and Vance Duke"" into the storyline wasn't the great disaster it was in 1982.  Schneider and Wopat walk off the show to strike over issues related to merchandise royalties, and the show clamors to hire two new individuals to fill the huge gap.  Granted, the replacement cousins were no Bo and Luke, but hey, the character of Coy (played by Byron Cherry) was quite likeable and down-home like, and the change in roles allowed the show to experiment a little.

Rick Hurst (""Deputy Cletus"") stayed on the show as Sonny Shroyer (""Deputy Enos"") returns from his failed spin-off series, and it's great that we have both deputies on several of this season's early shows until Hurst finally departs.  Secondly, the comedic talents of ""Boss Hogg"" (Sorrell Booke) and ""Sheriff Rosco"" (James Best) are second to none in the fifth season, as the two really stepped it up to ease the absence of Schneider and Wopat.  The two really carry the weight of the season, and they do it hillariously!

Not only that, but one of the best episodes of the show's entire run, ""Witness: Jesse Duke"", shows the great talent of Denver Pyle (""Uncle Jesse""), and the chemistry of the ""new Dukes"" finally gels within the storyline and with the rest of the cast, only to be gone in the next episode.

Otherwise, the stories found in this season are very good, and afterall, Bo and Luke do return towards the end.  In fact, another unique element here is the episode ""Welcome Back, Bo & Luke"", which features Bo, Luke, Coy and Vance on screen all together in this episode only.

A big thanks to Warner Brothers for continuing to release THE DUKES OF HAZZARD sets on DVD. Another thanks to Warner for making these single-sided discs (at an unbeatable price).

Plus Bo & Luke are on this set towards the end of the season they return.  One of my favorite episodes was ""Daisy's Shotgun Wedding"" which is on this set.  I like the box cover art too.

2410576,4,B000BB1MJ6,"Season five of The Dukes of Hazzard was a real Shark Jumping moment for the series as Bo and Luke are replaced by two carbon copy cousins(Byron Cherry and Christopher ""Chip"" Mayer) due to a contract despute with John Schnider and Tom Wopat.
Cherry and Mayer portrayed Coy and Vance Duke, two cousins who left Uncle Jesse's farm years ago. When Bo and Luke get the oppertunity to race the NASCAR circuit,Coy and Vance arrive back in Hazzard to help out on the Duke farm. Also returning is Enos Strate,from his  law enforcement job from LA(aka his show Enos was cancelled after one season).
 Unfortunately what could've been a new direction for the show turned out to be one of the biggest Jump the Shark moments. Coy and Vance were basically carbon copies of Bo and Luke. As much as Cherry and Mayer try,they're basically performing lines meant for the previous leads. Wheras Cherry seems to be getting into the role of Coy, Mayer comes off as stilted as Vance, especially when replacing Tom Wopat's Luke, the family tactician. Although there were some really good episodes(Treasure of Soggy Marsh,The Hazzard Hustle, and Witness: Jesse Duke),one can't help but wonder what they would be like if it was Bo and Luke featured.
  After 18 episodes which had eroded in the ratings,Wopat and Schnider finally returned to the show(and Coy and Vance were never to be seen or heard from again).Even with internal problems on the show,other factors played into the show's decline(like Knight Rider, and other shows that made the Dukes look archaic).",1127952000,3,1539,4.862595419847328
2410577,5,B000BB1MJ6,"This season was not so great due to the sudden departure of DOH's original stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider in the spring of 1982. Wopat and Schneider were not gone for good,though. After failing to receive royalty payments for Dukes toys,games and other memorabilia that sold like hotcakes all over America and other countries as well,the pair walked off the DOH set,leaving Warner Bros.,the series' production company,to find two new Dukes to fill the places of Wopat and Schneider. WB held a nationwide hunt and and after screening 2,000+ applicants,they elected Byron Cherry and Christopher Mayer. The Nielsen ratings were at an all-time low,due to the absences of Wopat and Schneider. In the first episode THE NEW DUKES,which aired on September 24,1982,off-screen narrator the late Waylon Jennings explains to viewers that Luke(Wopat) and Bo(Schneider) have left Hazzard to try their luck on the Nascar Racing Circuit. So two new Duke cousins named Coy(Cherry) and Vance(Mayer) return to Hazzard after a six-year residence in Detroit to help Uncle Jesse(the late Denver Pyle) run the farm. Daisy(Catherine Bach) said in one of the first scenes to Jesse,""I don't think I'll recognize my own cousins."" J.D. ""Boss"" Hogg(the late Sorrell Booke) and Hazzard County sheriff Roscoe Coltrane(James Best) were celebrating(with champagne) the departures of Luke and Bo. ""Luke and Bo are out of my hair!"",happily sings Boss Hogg. That was before he and Roscoe learned about the arrival of Coy and Vance. Coy and Vance acted and did everything like Luke and Bo(climbing in and out of the General Lee,escaping the clutches of Boss Hogg,Roscoe and BH's deputy cousin Cletus and catching criminals). Viewers also witness Sonny Shroyer,who was the original Hazzard deputy Enos Strate,triumphantly returning to Hazzard after a brief stay in Los Angeles. So during this season,Hazzard had two deputies but Cletus would be gone for good after this season. Enos sorely missed the Hazzard gang,especially Daisy whom he always worshipped. In the opening montage,we notice Coy and Vance going ""YEE HAH!"" at the end just like Luke and Bo previously. Another change is Pyle's personal scene which had to be new so there would be no signs of Wopat and Schneider as it was in previous seasons. The highest-rated episode from this season is WELCOME BACK BO AND LUKE,which aired February 25,1983. In that episode,Wopat and Schneider triumpantly return(for good). Bo and Luke make a surprise entry in the Boar's Nest,a pub and short order restaurant owned by Boss Hogg and where Daisy works as a barmaid. That was the only episode which all four Duke boys were together. Luke and Bo missed Daisy,Uncle Jesse and service station attendant Cooter Davenport(Ben Jones). For that matter,all of Hazzard County. Cherry and Mayer were written out after that episode. In that opening montage,Wopat and Schneider regained their original star billing instead of being billed as special guest stars. Take note on the DVD package that only Bach appears(on the front photo). DOH got a fresh new start at the beginning of the 1983-84 season,for it was exactly the same,in the aspect of cast,as it was when the series premiered in January 1979.",1127779200,9,3206,5.155470249520153
2410578,5,B000BB1MJ6,"Warner Bros. continues to do a GREAT job with these ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" season box sets.  Each time the content and extras are great, the price point is VERY reasonable (especially now that the sets consist of 8-9 single-sided discs each) and the release schedule is surprisingly swift!  As I'm sure all of you know, this is the season where Bo and Luke were temporarily replaced by Coy and Vance.  I don't think anyone seriously thought that Warner would skip this season for fear of it being less popular for that very reason, but anyone who really was concerned about there being a gaping hole in their collection can now lay those fears to rest.

I remember seeing some of these episodes first-run, and as I recall there were some good ones thrown in the lot despite the absence of Schneider and Wopat.  Besides, they both returned to the show for the last few episodes of the season, so it is not totally devoid of them.  Any Coy and Vance haters had best remember that, as boycotting this season will cost them a few Bo and Luke episodes.

Only two more seasons remain before we will be able to own the entire series in its' original, uncut format!  That will all but render the chopped-up CMT airings obsolete.",1127520000,31,1220,4.538812785388128
2410579,4,B000BB1MJ6,"Coy and Vance may have sucked in comparison to the real Bo and Luke, but the movie version of ""Dukes"" makes Byron Cherry and Christopher Mayer look like Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles.  I think of season 5 as ""Diet Dukes,"" same flavor, lower octane, but still satisfying.  If you find yourself tiring of Coy and Vance, just remember they're only in 22 episodes and repeat to yourself, ""Bo and Luke are coming back.""  Kudos to Warner Brothers for not skipping this famous, yet infamous chapter of Dukes, and T.V., history.",1127520000,10,524,4.736263736263736
2410580,5,B000BB1MJ6,"KUDOS TO WARNER BROS. FOR HAVING THE GUTS TO RELEASE THE FIFTH SEASON OF THE DUKES OF HAZZARD, KNOWING IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE AS POPULAR AS OTHER SEASONS.  I HOWEVER DO NOT MIND THE ""COY AND VANCE ERA"".  THEY DID THE BEST THEY COULD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  WHATEVER WAS LACKING WITH THE ABSENCE OF BO AND LUKE WAS MORE THAN MADE UP FOR BY THE AMPED-UP COMEDY OF BOSS AND ROSCO.  I HAD THE PLEASURE TO RE-ENJOY THESE EPISODES RECENTLY AS THEY AIRED ON CMT AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO OWNING THEM VERY SOON.  THERE WILL NEVER BE ANYTHING MORE MAGICAL THAN THE ORIGINAL DUKES OF HAZZARD EPISODES-ESPECIALLY NOT THAT PIECE OF CINEMATIC GARBAGE STARRING A JACK---, AN AMERICAN PIE IDIOT AND AMERICA'S FAVORITE DITZY BLONDE.

I don't mind not having the stars there the rest of cast makes it funny. If i was the stars of the show and i found out that I was not getting paid for toys and other stuff i would walk out.
