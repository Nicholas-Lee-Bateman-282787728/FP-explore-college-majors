8344079,5,B001UK3GY6,Another great Sanada action flick!  It includes other great JAC actors with loads of action!,1434326400,,92,5.133333333333334
8344080,5,B001UK3GY6,"This movie is BONKERS - and I do mean that in the best way possible.

It opens with the apparent gundown-murder (a la Sonny Corleone) of the film's leading man (Henry Sanada). But, wait, NO: it turns out it was his twin brother! Cut to Texas (?!) where the other Henry Sanada (incongruously called 'Georgie' in the English-dubbed version I watched) rides horses and ropes cattle (don't all Texans?) under the tutelage of none other than Milton Ishibashi (villain Junjo from the first two 'Streetfighter' films), who kidnapped Georgie as a child (as it turns out, for his own protection). Adoptive uncle dies, so Georgie goes to Japan to find out the truth of his family.

There, among others, he meets up with none other than real professional wrestler Abdullah the Butcher as Spartacus (?!), bodyguard to a bevy of Japanese cuties in bikinis whose tops Georgie's pet spider monkey, Peter, keeps stealing. (Yes, I just re-read that last sentence and I'm still not sure whether or not this movie was the result of a chili-induced fever-dream.) Also, Georgie comes into contact with his blind, piano-playing, martial arts expert sister, played by - who else? - Sue 'Sister Streetfighter' Shiomi. She is under the protection of her seemingly kindly uncle who (SPOILER) turns out to be the man behind Georgie's parents' deaths (evil uncle gave the pilot of Georgie's parents' airplane coffee with an overdose of sleeping medicine - what better way?).

All of this is all related to Georgie and the audience by Mr. Magic (Sonny Chiba) and his hideous ventriloquist dummy, in a scene that baldly borrows from 'Hamlet', a play to whose story this film's does bear some more than superficial resemblances.

In case we weren't sure, we know that the uncle is REALLY bad because he fetishizes Nazis and Beethoven, hanging a portrait of Der Fuhrer himself in his secret bad guy HQ and having one of his evil henchwomen dress in something like a combination of Gestapo-meets-cheap hooker lounge wear (this character, at one point, utters the line, ""You're going on an Auschwitz Special Honeymoon."" - NOT making that one up, I swear).

The film's tone varies wildly, from deadly serious and bloody to drippingly maudlin to Benny Hill-style comedic. Watch for the 'wacky' chase involving a cadre of ninja-monks going after Georgie through the streets of Tokyo, a chase which, at one point, has Georgie and his pal stealing a tandem bike from a pair of gay men necking by a fountain - I SWEAR TO GOD I am NOT making this up! - and knocking over some nuns in full habits, one of whom is wearing red lace panties (!?).

Rappelling must have been big in 1982 because this movie features more than its fair share. Then there's the Hong Kong final showcase showdown which plays like a martial arts video game, with Georgie taking on wave after wave of variously armed and abled hench-dudes until his evil uncle finally clues into the fact that he'd better make a run for it. The final chase owes more than a little to the previous year's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", with Georgie pursuing the jeep-driving baddies on horseback while contending with other hench-dudes throwing bombs from a helicopter. When he finally faces off against his evil uncle (SPOILER), Georgie delivers the death-blow by karate-punching a 140-karat diamond into his uncle's eye socket (the pain of which causes uncle to fatally hurl himself off a cliff).

With a theme song sung by Sanada and fight scenes directed by Sonny Chiba himself, this is one for the ages. And did I mention the lounge where they hang out called 'Casablanca', whose owner dresses exactly like Bogart from that movie?",1414281600,,3644,4.839486356340289
8344081,4,B001UK3GY6,"I wasn't able to find this DVD anywhere and as kid I use to watch this movie all the time. I was extremely happy to find this DVD on Amazon. I received the order in a quickly time frame, unfortunate the first shipment that was received was the wrong DVD. They were able to resolve the issue and had a replacement issued.",1397952000,,320,4.17741935483871
8344082,5,B001UK3GY6,"If you grew up in the early to mid 80's Martial arts explosion, and is a fan of Hiroyuki(Henry) Sanada with kung fu/Karate action, this movie is for you. The Movie is Physically dated, but the set and time frame of the story and era is modern than most of martial arts films where it's set in the 17 to 1800's era, this how ever you will see cars, buses street thugs,guns, daggers and pocket knifes similar to Bruce lee's ""Way of the Dragon"". If you understand and lived through the humor and toughness of the 80's you'll definitely love this movie, fast paced interesting Characters, Good guys/gal's, and bad guys/gals alike, so lovable on both ends. I'm not going to spoil or give a synapses of the story, If you love director sonny chiba, have, liked, or watched ""Ninja Bugeicho momochi sandayu""AKA in the U.S ""Shogun's Ninja, This is a MUST HAVE !",1396915200,,851,4.532467532467533
8344083,5,B001UK3GY6,"I've had the VSH version for years and years and was delighted to find a DVD copy.  The quality is great and, best of all, it's not a dubbed version!",1391731200,,149,3.966666666666667
8344084,5,B001UK3GY6,"This movie is a very rare find. I am a huge fan of Hiroyuki Sanada. The movie also includes Sonny Chiba, Etsuko Shiomi, and others from the Toei films movies. (sister streetfighter, the streetfighter,etc.) The dvd cover is incorrect. Hiroyuki Sanada only appears shirtless for 4 seconds of the movie. He is completely clothed through out the movie. The movie does not have subtitles, it is dubbed. The menu is in Japanese. This film is very rare, and worth a purchase. Eventually, this movie will increase in price due to the fact that it stars Sonny Chiba, it being rare, and that it is hard to find!",1380931200,2,601,4.626168224299065
8344085,4,B001UK3GY6,i've seen the english version will pick up the japanese version it's more better in it's original i try to find movies i've  seen in english but prefer the japanese or any other in its orginal language...the picture is better,1307577600,,225,4.625
