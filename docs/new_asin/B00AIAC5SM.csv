5425926,5,B00AIAC5SM,We have had several dogs over the years that we've never really bonded with due to the lack of understanding our dogs and them understanding what we expect.  3 Dog Days helped us to bond with our dog by explaining the psychology side of good training.  Angie Winter's video is not only light hearted... but even easy for our kids to follow and apply.  It's a training video like no other for the whole family!,1357171200,2,409,4.426666666666667
5425927,5,B00AIAC5SM,"Angie Winters has captured the secret to a happy, well behaved, family dog and guess what?  It's easy!  While watching this video about dog behavior, not dog training, it all becomes so clear!  If you are willing to devote just 3 days to your beloved dog over 4 months old, you and your dog will be happier, calmer and secure in your places in your relationship.  New dog, or established family pet, ""your dog is ready to start over whenever you are!""  I can't recommend this DVD enough!",1357171200,3,487,4.488636363636363
5425928,5,B00AIAC5SM,"A  Dog-Training DVD that is simple, effective, AND engaging.  Hmmmmm...Sounds like the most difficult formula in the industry today.  So many training  dvd's become victims of bad editing, poor production, or convoluted training methods that require too much explanation.  Many others, while informative, are often boring.  Well, now I've found a DVD that is entertaining, informative, and uses a methodology that IS  something truly innovative...Common Sense, and sound canine psychology.

 The title of the DVD is,  ""3 Dog Days"", produced by Columbus, Ohio based Dog Behaviorist, Angie Winters, and ""German Shepherd Adventures"" gives it an enthusiastic  5 PAWS UP! (5 out of 5).

  It should be noted from the start that the methods here are NOT intended for dogs under 4 months of age, but are designed as lessons for teaching respect, structure, and leadership to your pet.  They would be especially effective for Rescued dogs, or those taken into your home at a later time than puppyhood.  That's as close as I can get to a critical statement of the DVD...I truly hope that Angie produces more instructional dvd's in the very near future, addressing other subjects such as bringing home a new puppy.  She has a gift for understanding dogs, and teaching people what to do for them.  Let's get to the meat of the matter!

  ""3 Dog Days"" is based solidly on the owner being a LEADER.  Ms.  Winters first point is that her method provides ""...firm structure in a respectful manner...never hit, kick, or yell"" at your dog...Anger doesn't teach anything"" .  (Now you can say the words, ""that's just common sense"")  She further makes the point very clear, that this is all about the Relationship that exists between humans and dogs.  It's a very special and unique arrangement that effectively helps the team to develop a mutually supportive atmosphere based on trust between Leader and Follower.  Winters has a sound understanding of how dogs think, and what they want from us in every day life, and she describes it very well.

Using three techniques, (1) Silent Support  (2) Companionship and Control  and (3) Crate Work, ""3 Dog Days""  will guide you both thru a weekend that will create an entirely new atmosphere in your home.  These are very positive techniques, without being mired down by the ""jargon"" and ""What does that Term mean?"" of so many ""positive training methods"".  Again, this is just innovative ""Common Sense"" being used.  Somewhere, we lost that in the science that has become so prevalent in dog training.

""3 Dog Days"" also utilizes the idea that each and every dog is a unique individual, requiring  a different approach.  This is the true strength of Ms. Winters approach.  Her well-rounded, and flexible techniques allow for such needs, which makes the canine in the equation more at ease.  Affect the dogs mind, to create a respectful relationship...This is powerfully demonstrated by the use of a ""feral"", completely untrained dog, undergoing the transformation into an ideal pet dog.

One outstanding method used here, is the most difficult to master for the human.  KEEP SILENT while training.  Do Not use the voice to calm the dog.  All of us talk too much in this relationship and learning Silent Support will push you into a powerful tool in training your dog.

Body Language is another tool in the ""3 Dog Days"" that you will learn.  Our dogs watch us closely, far more so than we as humans do.  Focusing on that will be a revelation to some.  Using the snap of a finger, Winters corrects the dog from a distance, and gets the results that make your dog the well-behaved pet you desire.  Achieving Leadership, Leadership, and Leadership are the backbone of the ""3 Dog Days"" method.  The dogs mind, and personality , are both  fully engaged by the trainer/owner.  The steps to follow are clearly and easily explained in their entirety.  Many instructional dvds today seem to hold back small details from the viewer, so as to create a need for another DVD, to explain even further.  ""3 Dog Days"" gives you every detail the first time...

Mention should also be given about the technical details of the ""3 Dog Days"".  If you have ever watched DVDs from Leerburg productions, you have found them instructive and interesting.  But they have taken little care in their editing.  Spelling errors and other glitches are common, and annoying.  ""3 Dog Days"" was produced by professionals that crossed all the ""T's"", and dotted all the ""I's"".  The settings and lighting were well designed and easy on the eyes.  The best compliment I can give is that this dvd is one that you will watch over and over again!  ""Common Sense"" has found a home in the world of canine training!!!

  In conclusion, I need to explain something about the title of this review, in which the words ""Bubble Bath"" appear.  In a wonderful moment of whimsy and humanness, Winters demonstrates that your dog and his training should be FUN!!!  That's all the detail I'll give on that.  But the fact that this very instructional and informative  DVD doesn't take dog-training rigidly serious, will surprise and delight you!!!

The DVD is available from Amazon.com  found here.  It's well worth purchasing!  http://www.amazon.com/Days-Revolutionary-Training-Rehabilitation-System/dp/B00AIAC5SM/ref=pd_rhf_se_p_t_1",1356220800,20,5299,4.995412844036697
5425929,3,B00AIAC5SM,"The part of the description of this video I needed was ""OR rehabilitate a dog that is already a part of your family.""  But this was a video about the first 3 days of owning a new dog (in a new home).  I have had my dog for 2 years and I am trying to train him to be my service dog.  I understand this is a dog training video and not a service dog training video but I need to build a good foundation and this video tells you how to stop the dog from running the house the first 3 days in the home.  Not how to fix issues after the dog has already been part of the family.  I mean it's good tips but I was really hoping this would address existing behavior issues.",1481414400,,663,3.81021897810219
5425930,5,B00AIAC5SM,"Great tips on acclimating a new adult dog into your family and how to establish boundaries from the very start.  I used this when I brought home my Lab that I got through a rescue organization and it was so helpful.  I had my children watch it too, before we brought her home.  I did kind of tweak the rules a bit though, in that I wasn't completely silent with my dog for the first three days or not making eye contact with her.  I did pat her and talk to her every now and then, and Angie discourages that to some extent.  She said it causes separation anxiety when you do this but my dog hasn't had that problem at all.  This probably depends on the age of the dog, as I could see with younger, more hyper dogs, Angie's probably spot on about keeping the interaction minimal at first.  My dog is 8 and very sweet and easy going.  Some petting and gentle talking didn't set her back during her acclimation period.  I did use the crate training techniques she suggested to a tee and they worked perfectly.  My dog has never been in a crate as far as we know and now she loves hers.  She willingly goes into it when I tell her to or just on her own.  She has been with us for two weeks now and she is very well behaved.  After using Angie's techniques, she doesn't rush past me down the stairs or out of or into the house or jump out of the car until I tell her she can.  She doesn't try to tear up our stuff or counter surf, which the foster owner warned she would do.  I attribute her not doing any of that because I set expectations with her up front, using Angie's video to do this.  Highly recommend this.  It's not long and it is very ""how to"", which I love.  I want to be told how to do something.  Not told about the theory behind why I'd want to do it, and Angie is good about getting to the point.",1481241600,2,1807,4.03943661971831

5425933,1,B00AIAC5SM,"I watched this about half way through, this method of teaching is based on intimidating dogs, staring them down is threatening. She's misinterpreting the dog's body language, the dog looking away is not a form of 'submission' but merely a calming signal (there are many, blinking of the eyes, licking of the lips, looking away and on and on). Look up science based dog training, clicker training, the days of the alpha rolls, intimidation and man handling should be long gone and just because you have done it for a really long time, doesn't mean your methods are the best. There are far better dog training methods out there than this.",1480032000,2,636,4.738738738738738

I watched it alone and then thought it was important to share it with each family member, so we could all incorporate Mrs. Winter's methods into our training (both human and canine...lol.) The video is concise, focusing on the core of establishing a well trained dog. She shares gems of dog psychology throughout the video, and in this manner she really gives a great deal of what's needed for the vast area of dog training.",1474934400,,510,4.677777777777778
5425936,5,B00AIAC5SM,"3 Dog Days was a very informative video for anyone bringing a new dog into their home.  My family and I watched the video over a dozen times in preparation for our new dog and several times while crate training.  Angie's methods for positive reinforcement of good behaviors is great and the firm and respectful elimination of unwanted behaviors is also outstanding.  After the 3 days, our 1 year old lab is looking to us to go outside when the door is opened and understands the snap and look.  It laid a solid foundation for the work ahead in getting to know our dog and her getting to know us.  Angie's blog and supplemental information on youtube shows ""real life"" application of 3 Dog Days and how you can tailor it to your dog.

In future videos, I'd hope to see a bit more detail on how to use the 3 Dog Days kit and when to introduce certain items.  I'd also love to see more followup videos on dog behavior from Angie.

Understanding dog psychology is really at the root over everything.

5425938,5,B00AIAC5SM,"I can not even begin to describe how well Angie explains just how 3 days can change a dogs entire outlook on life!  I deal with difficult behavioral cases often as well as work with rescues and when I saw this video I thought EVERY FOSTER should have to watch this...no no EVERY DOG OWNER!  I try to explain to people the concept behind taking the dog everywhere with you and I don't think they quite understand. This videois the perfect reference and explanation as well as shows the results and impact it can have on a dogs behavior to understand its boundries!  I truly hope more and more dog owners and fosters view this video as it will help the introduction of new dogs, create overall balance in the home and set your or your foster dog up for the ultimate success!",1473379200,,772,4.384615384615385

5425942,5,B00AIAC5SM,"I got a rescue and after the first week I felt like I was in way over my head with a high-energy, totally untrained, nearly wild dog...I was sincerely worried we would be another human family that would fail him.  I did NOT want to send him back to the pound, so I ordered and tried ""3 Dog Days"".  The good news is, despite the fact we did not do the program within the initial days of ownership, it still worked beautifully.  Our new pal is much calmer and very happy in his new home...it has also made him extremely responsive to basic obedience training.  We are on our way to having a perfect new member to our family.  The point is, Winter's system can work at any time with any dog.  Even with a really high-strung dog, you could probably just keep doing the 3 day program for a few more days until he or she fully ""gets it"".  It is also worth noting that this system has also helped to establish mutual respect between the new guy and our old senior dog we already owned...a big hooray for no squabbles in a potentially volatile situation.  Both dogs are stable and know how to behave with one another as well as with us.  This is a great way to give a crash-course in basic manners and respect to your new rescue...I recommend this to both new dog owners and seasoned veterans who want to make sure they can do a really good job with a new pet.  Maximum results in minimal time!",1445904000,9,1386,4.23574144486692
5425943,5,B00AIAC5SM,We just brought a foster puppy home.  We watched the video as a family several times before we got the dog. We are on day two and so far so good!  We have found that the lack of words did seem to keep our puppy calm and we were able to become the leaders of her pack.,1442793600,,267,3.6666666666666665
5425944,2,B00AIAC5SM,"We got this video because we knew there were some behavioral changes in our dog that needed to be made.  Right off, I will tell you...you need to buy Cesar Milan's DVD on dog Socialization, which you can also buy a dog kit with the DVD, book, and pack leader collar (most effective);.  90 minutes and covers a lot of ground and gives several examples of behavioral problems.  See also his website, wwww.cesarsway.com  for lots of behavioral help.

  3 Dog Days may be good for new dogs coming into a home.  I wish we would've had it when bringing ours from the Shelter 9 months ago!  Many reviews say good video for new dogs AND 'if you need to start all over'.  I disagree, we started over, and not a lot changed.  There are only a couple of examples that she shows in her 32-minute DVD, one for Anxiety Separation, and coming in and out of a door first, or when you say 'okay'.  There is hardly any 'how to' in this DVD, nor a book she's written with details to go to,  nor is her website of much use when you need help.  What she says is right on, but not hardly enough examples ;There just isn't enough help if you really need help- with one exception.  If you happen to live in her state, Ohio, I believe, you can rent her to come out for $200.  Maybe that's what the video is for, to lead to Ohio-resident home visits.",1441584000,2,1324,4.2151394422310755

5425947,3,B00AIAC5SM,"Not really what I was looking for.  The DVD describes a strategy to be used when bringing a new dog into the home.  We had already had our dog when we got the video, so it was too late to use the strategy.  Not worth the price since I only watched it once.",1428710400,,256,3.792452830188679
5425948,3,B00AIAC5SM,"This dvd is only 32 minutes in length, which works well as sort of a ""quick run down"" of some concepts regarding the basics of dog psychology if you are a new or novice dog owner, however I was honestly hoping to learn more since the title insights that this DVD is a ""Revolutionary Dog Training and Rehabilitation Program."" The dog psychology parts were delivered at a very fast pace, and felt to me like they were never discussed in much depth. It felt more like broad/generalized statements being made about the way dogs do things, as opposed to teaching the viewer the ""whys and hows.""

Angie Winters (the trainer hosting the show) seems like an extremely intelligent, practical and experienced dog trainer/behaviorist, the kind of person who likely does a fabulous job training in the field, or going to a clients house to teach face-to-face, but the chapters presented on this DVD feel very rushed. The strength of the DVD (in my opinion) was the information presented on the subject of ""separation anxiety."" I felt that this portion of the DVD spent enough time to take the viewer through a thorough look at how to help your new dog get beyond his fears of separation, and a plan to how to properly introduce the dog in to their new home etc. I wish the other lessons on the DVD were done using the same level of time and explanation to really help the audience (viewers at home like me) follow what is being discussed. In my opinion, this DVD could have been doubled in length without presenting any other additional ideas/concepts/training tips, and would have been a much stronger teaching tool.",1420588800,11,1605,4.691489361702128
5425949,5,B00AIAC5SM,"If you own a dog, you need to get this DVD!  Angie has an amazing rapport with dogs and an uncanny understanding of dog psychology.  She has created a revolutionary technique, that allows dog owners to become the leaders their dogs need while respectfully training their dogs to be happier and well behaved.  I have now witnessed Angie's ""3 Dog Days"" technique work on two very different dogs with two very difficult behavioral problems.

At about age 3, our oldest dog, Bailey, began marking inside our home and nothing we tried seemed to do any good or stem that awful habit.  We had to segregate Bailey to protect our home and this went on for several years until I heard of Angie and her dog training technique.  Angie taught us that because we were not asserting ourselves as the leaders, Bailey felt like HE needed to be the leader and protect the home.  Our dog was scared and did the only thing he knew how to do...mark his territory to protect his home.  Using Angie's 3 Dog Day technique, I was able in three short days to undo years of bad behavior!  It was a miracle!  Now, our dog looks to us to be the leaders and is more relaxed and feels less threatened by the unseen challenges he previously was reacting to.

  Recently, I witnessed another dog undergo this type of training.  My son owns a Jack Russell - Rat Terrier mix named Swisher.  This poor little guy was much more anxious and nervous reacting wildly to any type of noise.  He would especially freak out at thunder and become inconsolable and lash out often hurting himself and destroying things around him in the process.  This little guy also become quite aggressive toward other dogs and eventually toward my son when my son tried to control him.  The dog would bark  and demand attention constantly and when my son tried to correct him simply by saying NO, the dog would lunge and try to bite him.  Obviously, Swisher was miserable and so was my son. Some dogs are harder to train than others and in Swisher's case, my son needed to spend more time with the technique.  Swisher eventually learned to look to my son as the leader and become less bothered by outside noises and more willing to relax and enjoy life rather than try to dominate it.  He stopped barking and stopped challenging other dogs and my son.  It is so heartwarming to see Swisher relax and begin to enjoy life which in turn allows my son to spend quality time with him.  Everyone wins!!

I tell everyone about this DVD and technique.  It's more about training you, the owner, how to be the leader....which in turn greatly enhances your relationship with your dog and creates a happier, healthier dog.  I urge anyone who has a dog to try this!  You simply need to dedicate three days to your dog which is nothing when you consider you are creating a lifetime of enjoyment for both of you.",1403827200,7,2837,4.509803921568627
5425950,5,B00AIAC5SM,"I just finished the video and it is just what I was looking for.  Our dogs in the past were not as well behaved as I thought they might be, but I just wasn't sure where to turn to change that behavior.  This video makes total sense and is so simple in its psychology.  I knew that you needed to establish yourself as a leader, but was just never sure how to do it.  Angie makes it clear and very simple and easy to follow way!

Buy this DVD if you are looking for guidance on how to make a rescue dog your own or a current pet even greater.  Once you understand her simple philosophy it all becomes easy.

It is very clear that Angie is a gifted dog behaviorist.  Her experience includes working with rescue dogs for
10 years. Angie's wide range of experience, research, knowledge and personal insight has enabled her to create a program that has been recommended by foster/rescue workers--and I've seen an interview about her successful work with search and rescue dogs.

I believe the program that Angie has developed (and shares on this DVD) is extremely valuable--particularly for the thousands of individuals and families that are looking to adopt dogs from shelter/foster environments!

Previously, our family had a very bad experience when we adopted an abused dog from a shelter.  If only we
had this DVD then!  My hope is that Rescue Organizations around the world will begin recommending this DVD
on a regular basis to help new owners transition their dogs.  I believe that this is the best way to create a solid foundation to build a wonderful relationship with your dog.

I like the fact that this is NOT a long, drawn-out DVD.  Instead, it is easy to watch and packed full of valuable information and tools.  Our family watched it several times before adopting our rescue dog, and learned something new each time we watched!

No treats, no yelling, no brutal leash techniques. Angie truly has a gift with dogs, and by the time you have success with your own dog, you'll swear you have the same gift. This video is not painstakingly long and she gets right down to business. She also has a blog where you can go to get any additional help if needed. I very highly recommend this video. One very important note: be sure the dog you are training is at least, at very minimum, 4 months old. As of this writing, my 4 1/2-month-old cocker is still a bit too young mentally (too much puppy) to grasp the whole meaning, but she did make some noticeable improvement after using Angie's ""3 Dog Day"" method. I am going to revisit this method again in another month. It only takes 3 days. So don't use treats to train your dog's BEHAVIOR; use treats to teach your dog tricks, like shake, roll over and do the ""Funky Chicken."" Use Angie's method to help your dog understand that YOU are the boss, the ""pack leader."" This is just the first and most important step to having a well-balanced member of your family. This method can be used any time, even if your dog has been with you for years, or if you adopt an older dog. Her ""3 Dog Day"" method is not intended cure your dog's behavior, but to get him/her to pay attention and start listening to YOU, and your other family members, so your other training will go much better and faster. Actually, Angie's method is designed to train YOU, and your other family members, and rehabilitate your dog.

Her DVD is easy to understand and her approach applies to so many issues we were having with our dogs.  I was amazed at how quickly the dynamic changed in our home.

5425972,5,B00AIAC5SM,"3 Dogs Days was recommended by a friend, and wow. I wish I'd have had this DVD before I went through 5 years of turmoil trying to train my older dogs the old fashioned way. I love Angie's style - firm but supportive; kind of like a more up-to-date Cesar Milan - and I love her methods. My dogs still benefited from what I learned, even though I consider them to be already trained.

I figure that if dogs are part of our family, then we have an obligation to do right by them. That doesn't mean dressing them up; that means giving them the stability and structure they need to be happy. (Then you can dress them up later haha.) I'm glad I got this!",1358467200,2,648,4.142857142857143
5425973,5,B00AIAC5SM,"This 3 Dog Days DVD is a MUST HAVE for any dog owner.  Even if you've had your dog for years, this system will improve your relationship.  Definitely something I will use on all future dogs and foster dogs. Watching this DVD and implementing her system by spending 3 solid days with your dog will provide you with YEARS of a loving, and easy dog-human relationship.  It is worth the money SO many times over. My life and the life of my dogs will never be the same. This system is revolutionary, yet so easy.  Angie's philosophy makes so much sense and you will see results quickly if you follow the system. Best money I've ever spent.",1357516800,8,634,4.3931623931623935
5425974,5,B00AIAC5SM,"I will tell you up front that I have known Angie Winters for quite some time.  When I met Angie, it was immediately obvious to me that she loves animals in general and dogs in particular.  She is truly dedicated to making life better for dogs and their people.

3 Dog Days is a labor of love in which Angie will help dog owners learn to think from a dog's perspective to establish a happy, healthy connection between dogs and the people they live with.  Once that base trust and understanding is established, the canine / human relationship can flourish.  Lacking such a level of trust or understanding can lead to behavior problems.  It is essential that any newly adopted dog be introduced properly into the home and Angie shows you how to do it successfully.

I have seen firsthand the amazing results that Angie gets applying the 3 Dog Days system with the rescue dogs she helps.  I don't use the word amazing lightly here - it really is.  To see a dog who is wild and out of control quickly learn that he is not in charge and HAPPILY accept the new rules and his place in the world as a respectful pet is quite something.  On the other end of the spectrum...to witness a dog who is scared of people learn to trust again and become happy is a joy as well.

I highly recommend you get 3 Dog Days and let Angie share this simple yet powerful system with you.

I own three dogs, I have tried various techniques and training in the past but nothing has worked so fast and so effectively as Angie's intuitive system. She really has gotten 'inside' the dog's head, and you will to, by watching 3 Dog Days. Thank you, Angie! I can now enjoy my wonderful dogs!",1357257600,,425,4.461538461538462

I'm a foster, so I bring dogs in allll the time, and then upon adoption, I recommend actions to the adopting households to help them incorporate my foster dog into their family.  Angie's video is right on target on helping foster, new adoption families, or even existing dogs learn the best behaviors.

I cannot say enough positive things about this DVD!  My sister recently got a dog, and I immediately gave her my copy of the DVD and told her to watch it -- and then give it back to me!!

5425978,5,B00AIAC5SM,"My family was lucky enough to adopt a dog recently and we used the 3 Dog Days system before bringing him in to our home.  Our foster dog acclimated so quickly in to our home by following everything Angie took us through on the video.  We watched it numerous times in the week before taking him in, even our 6 year old son watched it so that he would understand the importance of the system and know exactly what he needed to do.  We now have a dog who respects us as leaders, knows how we want him to behave, looks to us for approval before running out the door, goes in to the crate without any hesitation....the list of a perfect dog goes on and on!  I'm not sure where we'd be today had we not taken the time to do the ""3 Dog Days"" system.  Angie walks you through each phase in an easy-to-understand way that really makes sense.  This is a fantastic video, especially for first time dog owners, but the amazing thing about this video (and dogs) is that even a dog you've had for years can benefit from 3 Dog Days.",1357171200,9,1017,4.163265306122449

8551969,5,B00AIAC5SM,"Wonderful!  We used the 3 Dog Day techniques for two shelter dogs and are convinced it is the method for well adjusted dogs. Three days may seem like a long time, but the upfront effort pays off big.  We watched the video several times to cement the techniques so we knew what to do when we brought each dog home.  We also had our children and neighbors watch the video so they could be a part of the 3 day process. When we brought our second dog home, the first dog benefited from the calm, silent leadership we provided and the transition went smoothly.  We now have two dogs who wait patiently at the stairs, at open doors, and in the car; two dogs who are calm in the house, even when we are gone; and two dogs who like being in their crates.  They are loving, well behaved members of our family who are a joy to be around. Thanks to Angie, we all know how to ""disagree"" with a dog's behavior in a way that helps the dog understand our expectations and do what we want. Thank you Angie, please continue making videos!

If you are currently checking out shelter dogs, in addition to 3 Dog Days, I also strongly recommend you view Angie's YouTube videos called ""How to Choose a Rescue Dog - Parts 1-6"". You should see these as a companion series to 3 Dog Days. Going to the shelter is somewhat nerve racking and these videos help you arrive with a solid plan so that you don't start making mistakes on day one.",1491868800,5,1412,4.25
8551970,2,B00AIAC5SM,"I didn't find this very helpful, and I don't think most of the ideas presented would work for me and the new dog I'm adopting next week. I'm no expert at all, but I have some experience with dog training classes as a participant with my former dogs. I also hired a private dog trainer to coach me with my last dog, and the techniques were very useful for the lifetime of my dog, who passed away last year at 12 years old. The techniques I learned from the hired private trainer did not align with the philosophies/techniques presented in this video. I was hoping this video would teach me about puppy training (specifically house-training, as I've never adopted a young pup before), but it was stated at the beginning this method of psychology/training is not applicable to dogs less than 4 months. The puppy I'm adopting is about 12 weeks old, so I didn't get the information I wanted. I continued watching the video out of curiosity, but couldn't agree with some of the information given. I think her basic premises on dog psychology have merit, but I can't see myself adopting this approach. I'll be on the lookout now for a video on puppy house-training, or at least will scour the web for some good articles on the topic.",1490313600,,1226,4.552036199095022

8551974,4,B00AIAC5SM,"We viewed Angie's video to prep to be the best ""parents"" we could be in anticipation of adopting a rescue dog. The video was very practical and easily applicable. We found the advice helpful because it was direct, understandable, and wasn't surrounded with a lot of theory or unnecessary content. (We picked up some books by another dog expert from the library and found them almost unusable due to the flood of theory and lack of helpful, hands-on directions.) Our adoptive dog ended being a quick learner - she was already housebroken and pretty eager to please, so we adapted the method from the video for our own home. However, I can easily see the full three days being a huge help for puppies (that are old enough) or rescue dogs that haven't lived with people before (or weren't taught manners). The method here won't fix every behavior problem, but the video lays a solid foundation for consistently communicating leadership and balance to your dog.

The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is that it's almost a bit too short (though at 30 minutes, it's easily watched and rewatched). We'd love to see more content from Angie that deals with other specific behavioral challenges. If you're thinking of adopting a dog, puppy or rescue, I strongly recommend watching this once or twice to help get in the right mindset to be the best leader for your dog.

Finally, I'd like to add that I emailed Angie via the contact information on her Website, and she answered back personally, addressing the specific situation discussed in my email. That's impressive support and commitment to helping others be the best leaders possible.",1483401600,7,1647,4.81625441696113
