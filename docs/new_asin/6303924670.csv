Could not believe it when I saw it at Walmart...yep, I snatched it quick. Believe me this is a must have kind of movie! Harry Belafonte is executive producer. Great acting and subject matter.",1199491200,,314,4.25
725662,5,6303924670,"Greeting fellow movie buffs. This movie, ""The Affair"", originally titled ""Black Tuesday"" was a turning point in my world of enjoying movies. The reason I know what the movie was originally named is because, I was an extra in this film and was given the background at the beginning by Harry Bellefonte, the executive producer.

Being a black airman stationed in the UK worked out for most of the crew that where seen in the background. The production company used about 150 black airmen from the neighboring bases  as extras. I must attest to the fact that times have definitely changed since the 40's in the UK along with the military. I never ran into any situations like Courtney Vance's in the movie the whole 4 years that I was stationed in England.

Courtney Vance and crew gave a great performance in this movie! I was on the set and almost forgot that this was a movie. Bill Nunn did a great job with his role as a Sgt in the Army. He had one scene after we got released from jail, where he just amazed all of us with his comments. He chastised us for being happy about being released, but it was so pure acting, because none of us knew what his lines where going be. The looks on our faces where genuine shock and awe.

The most amazing thing about this movie, is that these types of actions still go on in the US military now. Our leaders will always sacrifice an enlisted member to save face. Enough about that, I'm glad that the creators of this movie thought about being PC, because we don't need another negative image of the color black. ""Black Tuesday"" or ""The Affair"", this was a great movie and great memory for me and my comrades in arms. I hope this has given you a little incite into a great period piece. My one disappointment is that this movie hasn't been made on DVD after all these years. This is a must have in your video collection.",1152057600,6,1859,4.379710144927536
725663,5,6303924670,"In ""The Affair"" Courtney Vance gives a strong performance as a Black G. I. stationed in England during W. W. II who meets and falls in love with a married Englishwoman. It is a compelling story because it dramatizes how dangerous love, whether extra-marital or not, could be between a Black man and a White Woman. It should be recalled that during W. W. II black and white soldiers in the U. S. still served in separate divisions. Racism, though somewhat less pronounced, still was rampant within the U. S. military and with that came the usual strong prohibition against sexual relations between the races. However, war, perhaps more than any other setting, allows for all kinds of situations. It was within this volatile mix of war and entrenched racism that a Black G. I. meets and falls in love with a White Englishwoman.
  This is a movie that engages its audience at many levels. It can be seen as a Romeo and Juliet type of love tragedy, as a cautionary tale of the effects of war on both soldiers and civilians alike or, finally, as a reminder of the  long road that U. S. society had yet to travel on the road to racial equality. Unfortunately, U. S. society is still on this road and has not yet reached its end. Perhaps, fine movies such as this one can spur faster movement toward the end of the road where there lies the racial equality that MLK spoke of forty years ago.",1061856000,14,1384,4.484126984126984

725819,1,6303924670,"I'M LOOKING FOR THE PART WHERE SOMEBODY SAYS ""AN AFFAIR IS WRONG & VERY HARMFUL""....all I read was that an affair is a ""love story""--wow!  That's raw.  I'm doing research on the subject of ""an affair""...especially now that we are FREE women and then there is something else we live with and that is this worldview (founded by American children): ""I can do what I want when I want to and with who I want.""  Oh I know that sounds like I'm talking about ""race""....but I know that there is no such thing as a ""race"" of people...so no, I'm not talking about race; I'm talking about THE MORAL COMPASS, that is talked about in every human society.  WHAT I AM SPEAKING ABOUT IS MORALS.  There is nothing  in your posts about the harm and the pain that is caused when we fall ""in lust"" and become out of control.  There are so few occassions when it is really love in these cases.  Really, really love and not lust.  WELL.  SHAME ON ALL OF YOU WHO DID NOT ADDRESS THE AFFAIR ON MORAL GROUNDS...no matter their skin complexion.  So, WHAT WIND GOT UNDER MY SAIL?  The most recent version of ""THE AFFAIR"" is a tv series and I am still seething over the ""trollop's"" behavior in that movie.  She went into the wife's house, her bed, with her husband and had the nerve to take a shower and use her shampoo and deliberately emptied the bottle because it was expensive.  And she left her bra so it would be found.  How revolting!!!  How revolting.  Some might say it was ALL his fault because the husband brought her into his house.  Well.  We have always said males are pigs but this kind of behavior out of females  brings the whole world to a new low.  So repulsive I don't have the words.  I literally can't get over the thought of finding a ""trollop"" in my house and in my bed and my shower.  She can have that man but she can't lay in MY  bed.  (WE are going backwards, for sure.)--MO",1426204800,,1873,4.282857142857143

725911,5,6303924670,"I've been searching for this movie for months, after it kept popping in my mind. I'd seen it several years ago and, in some romantic moments, I've longed to share it with my wife as we are an interracial couple. I'm so glad I found it after finally taking the time to REALLY scour the Internet.

""When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd"" was my search-line on google; unfortunately, it kept bringing up Walt Whitman (well, of course, duh!). That poem was my consolation at the end of the movie as Maggie recounted the love-story in her old age, dove-tailing it with one of Whitman's best. The affection and - to some extent - the passion was still there in her voice; and the tears flowed as she reminisced what could have been.

A most realistic portrayal of the times (EVEN TODAY!), played by two very talented actors. 5-stars, hands-down.",1356566400,,842,4.6066666666666665

725913,4,6303924670,"I bought this DVD for my husband because he is an extra in this movie.  When he was stationed in England with the USAF the movie company recruited people from the US armed forces as extras.  The original movie was supposed to be more about prejudice than a love affair but it turned into a very watered down version of what is was supposed to be which was rather disappointing, a very basic love affair with hints of prejudice.  Could have been a better movie if they'd left the original concept alone.",1334707200,2,502,4.434782608695652

The relationship of a lonely and married Caucasian woman and a black soldier.  The  setting is in England and the soldier is executed because his lover is forced by her husband to allege that she was raped by the soldier, instead of admitting their affair was consentual.  When the woman tries to break clean, after discovering her husband had lied to her about her lover's punishment, it was too late.

A very powerful movie involving an interracial relationship in the 1940's.",1312848000,2,701,4.515873015873016

No doubt, ""The Affair"", shall 'prompt' a different 'avenue of thought', leading skeptics, towards, having to, now; seriously consider, completely abandoning racism and bigotry. I hope that the story of ""the Affair"" has begun to 'embarrass them into submission.'
