8086707,5,B000BGR0LU,"There's only one problem. It says that it's only in English. Is there really no japanese with English subtitles, or did the peopel who typed out the description mess this up? If it's subtitled I'll be sure to get it later. This is one of my very favorite animes, so I'd be very sad if this stopped me from getting it.",1376870400,,317,4.213114754098361

8086709,4,B000BGR0LU,This and is companion volume one are a fun and interesting way for children to learn about Japanese culture through the eyes of four little fairies who never seem to get it quite right. Through a series of misadventures the fairies learn that being human isn't necessarily easy and that just when you think it you have it figured out things can take a surprising turn. A good choice for young children.,1339459200,,402,4.597222222222222
8086710,4,B000BGR0LU,The show is very cute and basically a continuation of the first DVD.,1143072000,,68,4.3076923076923075
8086711,5,B000BGR0LU,"Once again we learn the cultures of Japan through the eyes of Chiriri, Hororo, Kururu and Sarara as they learn more about the human life in their quest to become human.  In this set of episodes the cute and adventurous fairies learn about the latter half of the year which is fall and winter.  While the first volume deals with sping and summer and has a barrel of laughs, this one does continue to contain the same comical and cute moments but also found in some of these episodes you see the more tender herted side of the girls through their laughter, tears, and big adventures.  I wnt spoil any of the surprizes awaiting you in these episodes but I will tell you that after seeing all of what the fairies learn and all the things they go through, it really makes people like me wish so much to travel one day to Japan throughout the year to experience the festivals events and ceremonies the Japanese celebrate.

Overall, I consider this series to be too cute for words and very educational.  Some of the highlights of this particular DVD would be like episodes such as December (Episode 9) and March (Episode 12).  March is the one where even I the viewer felt a few tears fall down my cheek as there were moments where my heart really went out to the girls.

Once again I rate this one 5 out of 5 stars.  Dont miss the chance to complete the series by purchasing this volume along with the other volume.  You won't be disappointed!",1141171200,4,1437,4.412878787878788
8086712,4,B000BGR0LU,"Now I haven't seen the DVD their selling (since it's not out yet) but I have seen the entire series (13)eps. And I loved the whole bunch! What's better than 4 cute fairy's that are 2 inches tall looking to learn more about earth? This is in an interesting format, each eps is a different month...IE: March, April...you get the point. Over all I loved the show that I saw...so I'm excited to see the legal version and how well they translate some of the funnier parts, which ushually have to do with the fairy's missunderstanding words, or thinking they mean somthing else...which is easy to do since lots of japanese words mean more than one thing in different context. On a side note, do not be looking for a huge plot here, it's funny and very bubbly, but there really isn't much of a plot...if you enjoy Digi Charat then you will like this!",1127692800,2,843,4.445161290322581
