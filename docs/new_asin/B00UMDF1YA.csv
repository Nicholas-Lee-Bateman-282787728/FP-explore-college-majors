7052195,1,B00UMDF1YA,"DVD series advertised as ""All NEW"" season 4. However, all episodes were previously already shown on T.V in March / April 2016 . I should have realized something was wrong when Acorn (Company that has first release rights for British programs) had no postings for new release of DCI Banks. Amazon should have posted these episodes were previously already shown from previous season. I previously purchased Season 4 DCI Banks (region 2-Europe, I own DVD player needed) that was also erroneous presented, contained episodes from earlier seasons. I'm returning this DVD set, and will purchase this series from Acorn, in the future.",1467244800,,627,5.1568627450980395
7052196,4,B00UMDF1YA,not as good as previous series,1455753600,2,30,4.166666666666667
7052197,4,B00UMDF1YA,"Actually, four and a half stars.  Three more solid outings for DCI Banks and his female partners, each of whom is still conflicted in her personal life.  Each episode is approximately 1 1/2 hours in length, divided into separate 45 minute segments.  The atmospherics are strong.  Leeds remains gritty; the skies remain gray; the blood continues to flow.  Stephen Tompkinson continues to be able to express a wide range of emotions through the movements of his eyebrows and laugh lines.  No episode stands out as particularly strong but all measure up to a common level of high quality.

Now, the consumer issue: a Dutch version is available from Amazon.co.uk (which I purchased).  It is far less expensive than this version.  It is in English, but the subtitles are in Dutch and the discs cannot be played on standard American dvd players.  In a number of scenes the subtitles would have been helpful, since a number of the characters speak quickly and use a lot of English idiom.  The price difference, however, was compelling for us.  My recommendation: if you don't have an all-regions dvd player (and you watch a lot of English television), consider buying one.  With the price differentials they pay for themselves very quickly.  I recommend players made by Pioneer.  We have had two of them and have been pleased in each case.  They are simple to set up and the modern all-regions players read the discs when they are inserted and play whatever you have fed them.  You no longer have to code each disc or go through any intermediate steps.  Some of the best British series (Dalziel and Pascoe, e.g.) have only been available via the Dutch and the regular English/American versions often differ significantly in price.  With an all-regions player, no problem.  Amazon.com sells them; check them out.",1446595200,15,1804,4.891089108910891

7052199,5,B00UMDF1YA,"WARNING: Because of the one year delay in releasing Season Four, several dealers have imported it from the Netherlands.
But the Dutch DVDs won't play on most U.S. DVD players.
Hint - If the cover reads: ""Gebaseerd op de Boeken von Peter Robinson -  De Complete Vierde Serie"", you have the Dutch version.
Don't order this unless you need you need Dutch subtitles - and own a region-free DVD player.*

Season Four was finally released in North America on June 28, 2016.
Amazon's search engine is now giving priority to the North American version.

----------------

This excellent and gritty British police series debuted in 2010.
Filmed in Yorkshire, primarily in the city of Leeds (population 750,000)
Since the series began, Stephen Tompkinson has played Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, and Andrea Lowe has played Detective Sergeant Annie Cabbot.
There is a surprising amount of sexual tension on this show.
D.S. Cabbot took maternity leave at the start of Season Two.
Nobody knows who the father is, and there is a great deal of speculation among her fellow officers.
[No, DCI Banks is not the father.]

In Season Two, Caroline Catz, as Detective Inspector Helen Morton, was brought in as a temporary replacement, but has caught on and is now part of the team.
(I have a major crush on this woman. This was her first series after ""Doc Martin"").
D.S. Cabbot came back as a single mother in Season Three.
All three are back for Season  Four.

My only concern is that there was entirely too much fraternization between the ranks in Season Three.
Too much ""Boinking""
Too much ""Rogering""
Too much ""Shagging""
Too much ""Hiding the Sausage""
Too much ""Taking Old One-Eye to the Optometrist""
--- British euphemisms for sexual intercourse (from the Online Slang Dictionary)

The implied sexual tension of Seasons One and Two is out in the open.
I would have thought the lower ranks were off-limits to Detective Chief Inspectors.
In my thirty years of experience with the British Police,
this sort of thing never turns out well.

Surprise: When Season Four opens, the romance between DCI Banks and DS Annie Cabbot has fizzled.
Sergeant Cabbot has gone back to her old boyfriend.
Most of the first episode is spent with DCI Banks mooning around for his lost love.
It doesn't help when Banks discovers that his romantic rival is training for the Ironman Triathlon.

English SDH subtitles.
My only real complaint is the lack of a Blu-Ray version.
Still five stars.

GOOD NEWS: Season Five has been announced for pre-order on Amazon.
BAD NEWS: The release date is March 7, 2017.
No dealers have imported the Dutch version of Season Five (yet)

* Region-free DVD players are actually a good idea.
Unfortunately you won't find them at Best Buy, Target or Walmart.
They are not illegal, but the big retailers are under a lot of pressure not to sell them.
On the Amazon search bar, under ""Electronics"" enter ""region free dvd player""
Several models under $50.

All DVD players are region-free when they come from the factory.
The regional encoding software is programmed in later.
It can be deprogrammed by someone who knows what they are doing
(there is a computer port on the back of your DVD player - along with a warning label that it is for authorized technicians only).

I have owned a Toshiba region-free player for two years, and it plays flawlessly.
In addition to playing every DVD in the world (PAL or NTSC), it will also play region A and region-free blu-rays, but not European region B blu-rays.
Region-free blu-ray players are available, but more pricey - in the $200 range (but the price will almost certainly come down if you are patient).
- but read the description carefully: ""region-free DVD / Blu-Ray player"" is not the same as ""region-free DVD / region-free Blu-Ray player"".",1439424000,22,5083,5.632198952879581

7052251,4,B00UMDF1YA,"I'm a fan of DCI Banks. The characters are well written and the stories are filled with morally challenged characters. The latter 2 episodes of this season annoyed me a little because Annie did bad police work. In one instance in each episode she clearly violated illegal searches (by US Law). I'm not sure if the books are written like this.
 Unlike the multitude of US Crime Dramas, I'm a fan of the British series because they are mysteries. They are not action dramas with car chases, gunfights, and machismo. I'm curious to start Season 5 soon.",1500595200,,549,4.65979381443299

7052309,5,B00UMDF1YA,"For ,those of us who are Peter Robinson fans of his books festuring DCI Alan Banks, we were overjoyed to see him come to life in the ITV series. DCI Banks is the head of detectives in the Yorkshire area, and all if the cases take place in these surroundings. We see the city, the country and everything in between.

Alan Banks look like a morose character with not much personality. Stephen Tompkinsin plays Banks. Ah, no, not true., he gas a rich life sometimes. Once married, he has a grown daughter, and in some episodes she is very much present. He lives in a lovely house, and his lives arecwine and music. You may find him at night in his study with wine listening to his favorite music. His other life is his job, and he is good at it. You may be surprise to hear he with his team solves every case.

Andrea Lowe, the beautiful blonde, impetuous at times, plays DS Annie Cabot. She flits in and out if Banks life as his sometime lover. An excellent detective, but makes hasty decisions. DI Morton, played by Carolyn Catz, a lovely brunette, wears a severe haircut. Does not allow emotion into much of her life. She is often brusque with people, needs to learn social skills, and I wonder if she In on the Autism spectrum. She is brilliant and most often correct. I like her best. The Team investigates their crimes, digs up all of the facts and solves every crime. A lot of murder and mayhem, abound.

At the end of a 45 minute episode you will feel like you watched an hour and a half of bad TV.  Its a cop show so there should be some excitement, shouldn't there?

So far, we have watched the pre-series movie and one season. While we are not as enamored with the series as we have been with other British crime shows, we will watch them all.  Because the stories from the books require more time than a one-hour TV show, most are split between two episodes, at a minimum. This is fine, especially when you have the entire series on disc.
