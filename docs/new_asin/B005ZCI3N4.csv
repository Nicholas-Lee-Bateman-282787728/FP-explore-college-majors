4907709,5,B005ZCI3N4,"If you are a fan of the series by all means do NOT wait for it to come to Amazon's US web site. It will be available in region 1 format on Amazon's Canadian site (AMAZON.CA) on 4-24-12. It is 29.99 Canadian (minus the exchange rate to the US dollar), plus 10.00 shipping international. I will not go into the show itself because you will either like it, or hate it. It is on SYFY on Monday nights 10 PM and has drawn huge complaints from censor loving religious thumpers. I will say no more. Check it out yourself. and if you like True Blood, then you will appreciate this show as well. Be patient as it could take 2 weeks to arrive from the release date.

UPDATE: IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES GO TO AMAZON.CA IMMEDIATELY. MINE WAS SHIPPED OUT FROM CANADA ON MONDAY 4-23. IT ARRIVED ON WED 4-25 AND I DID NOT PAY FOR EXPEDIATED DELIVERY. IT IS REGION 1, AND MY WIFE AND I STARTED WATCHING WHEN I GOT HOME FROM WORK. THIS IS THE SAME SEASON  BROADCASTING ON SYFY NOW. THE EXCHANGE RATE WENT DOWN AND IT ONLY COST $36.00 TOTAL.

If you like the series, this is how to get it now without any special universal equipment or waiting for a US distribution.

As of 6-5-2012, the price on AMAZON.CA dropped to $24.99 Canadian which is slightly less in US dollars. AMAZON.CA will convert all US $ to Canadian $. The people selling it here are actually buying it from Canada and jacking up the price. Save your $ and buy it from AMAZON's Canadian company.",1333152000,99,1439,4.279411764705882

The love triangle between Bo, Lauren, and Dyson is too ""juicy"" to resist! Although, the supporting characters are just as interesting, if not more.

The best part of the show is the mysteries and Kenzi's as the main characters sidekick.  The fantasy element in the real world also interesting.

4907732,5,B005ZCI3N4,"This is a series about the light and the dark Fae. It's really well conceived and well written fantasy series with elements of action,  drama,  and science fiction as well.
IF you're thinking this is just another show like so many that have become popular in the past several years,  and you've skipped over it because of that, you might want to reconsider and give it a chance. It's not at all like any other show I've seen before.

This is a great show for those who like to binge watch,  or watch one show at a time.  I don't have TV or cable,  I only stream and watch via my Viewsonic projector, and when I find a series I really like,  unless it's too dark,  I like to watch the entire series before moving on. This is one I'm really looking forward to seeing more of - those seasons that haven't yet been released.

I couldn't get enough of the main characters,  particularly Bo, played by Anna Silk, and Kenzie, played by Ksenia Solo. Bo grew up in a non-Fae family,  not knowing who,  or what she was until she was in her 20's,  which had tragic consequences.  She meets her best friend in the first episode, where you get a glimpse of who she is and what she's capable of.  I was hooked after watching the first episode.

Once the show gets into gear you meet the other integral characters,  and with few exceptions they're all very engaging.

This is a show with great plot lines,  imaginative and engaging characters and relationships. There are very few times when the show lags,  and the few times it does,  it passes quickly.",1468108800,,1539,4.382978723404255

4907745,4,B005ZCI3N4,"The 4/5 stars is for the 5 seasons, not just this first one.

Lost Girl is a marketing masterpiece. On the surface, it offers a sci-fi/fantasy spin for the heterosexual male who craves the erotic, but underneath it is a very powerful feminist reclaiming of female sexuality and a strong affirmation of bi and pan-sexuality. In this way, the series can reach audiences that most feminist narratives do not. Absolutely brilliant.

In the series, the writers recode the infamous ""succubus"" as a heroine. Bo is a ""lost girl"" who needs to find her place in a world that is much more than she ever imagined. Here, Lost Girl presents a world similar to Supernatural, but with a less unwieldly set of mythologies to weave together. Nearly every episode has an interesting twist and the major story arc is thought out. The good stories occur periodically outside the main narrative and there are multiple sub-plots that develop a nice temp. In addition, the fey world that Bo uncovers slowly provides a lot of repackaging (but good ones), but also some nice fresh material as well.

While the story lines are good, the series also provides sufficient character development to its myriad of characters. Some of the acting is spot-on and great, while some others are mediocre. The writing and the acting get better after the first season.",1451865600,,1327,4.8628318584070795

But if you are turning to this specifically as a follow-up to Buffy, I suggest staying away, or at least renting an episode or two before committing to buying the season.",1444521600,,483,4.318681318681318

It's good enough for those of us who are desperate enough for elves and fairies to cut our standards concerning good acting and good writing; you won't really get either of those in this one, but the story line is fun and there are a couple of fun characters to look forward to in every scene.  There are a lot of Lesbian love making scenes which seemed to add little to the story line.  These seemed to be more about the fantasies of the writers and felt unnecessary, and they seemed forced.

4907765,3,B005ZCI3N4,"I was hoping to fall in love with this show, but I didn't even finish off watching the season.  I just didn't care enough to see if any big reveal re Bo's parents was coming.  This show had some great potential, but the scripts...eh.  I liked Kenzi, the human sidekick of Bo, a Fae who didn't know she was Fae but know something was up as she kept sucking the life out of her sexual partners.  Kenzi was more interesting to me with her ability to speak Russian and her background in theft and strange cybergeek friends.  Bo, on the other hand, never seemed to change and everyone acted like she was a Big Deal, but I just never saw it.  The Light Fae and the Dark Fae didn't seem to have much difference between them and the plots ended up devolving into more of a monster-of-the-week format after a while.  I also never saw any real spark between Bo and Dyson, her wolf-shifting on and off boyfriend.  Maybe, this picked up in Season 2, but I'll never know because I didn't make it to the end of Season 1.  This could have been hot and full of strange fantastical plots, but it just fell a bit too flat for my tastes.

One day, she meets a girl named Kenzi which exposes her to her true species. Now it is up to Bo to decide whether she wants to serve good or evil! However, Bo refuses to join the collective. She sets out with Kenzi to ""find herself"" but has to fight not only her own vampiric/succubus urges but also her new enemies who know something about her family that Bo does not. Bo has no idea who she really is! She meets with her new protector/friend named Dyson who is similar to a werewolf and then becomes friends with a human woman doctor that helps to treat and help the supernatural inhabitants of her city. This is season 1 which is loaded with steamy sex scenes, occult action, and fantasy galore! Remember, the main character is part demon and ""drinks"" her victims' souls! How? By having sex with them, mostly! You get the idea. This show is rated TV14 but some episodes I would rate MA for nudity, violence, and extremely sexual innuendo and bed scenes. VERY steamy series.

4907774,2,B005ZCI3N4,"I think the first, and possibly most important observation, is that I don't think that we, as a couple of 50/60 somethings, are amongst the target demographic for this series. Bo the succubus wanders around with her dcolletage bursting out of her clothes all of the time, serving only to blatantly give teenage boys something to daydream about. Equally, the almost incomprehensibly nasal, whiney, faux Goth wannabe Kenzi adds nothing to the show beyond cheap, throwaway one-liners. Deep and cerebral this show is not.

On the plus side, however, the show demonstrates potential in the development of the Fae mythology and the back-stories of the main characters and the whole idea of a Fae underworld integrated into the human population was, at first airing in 2010, an original idea. However, although Bo is a succubus and, inevitably, there is a bound to be a bit of sexual content, it is overstated, Americanly bland and serves no purpose but to give the show a frisson of risqu while stopping any narrative flow dead in its tracks. In this first season, the stories are episodic, formulaic and obvious with little character development.

There are many parallels with the far superior Grimm and this is a rare case of the successor being a massive improvement on the progenitor. While Grimm is mature, cleverly plotted with a deep vein of underlying witty self-deprecation, Lost Girl is somewhat juvenile, shallow and unsatisfying. Its a shame really, it could have been quite good and Im sure the teen/20 something target audience will vehemently disagree, but there are far too many good grief not again and surely you cant be that dim moments. Being in its fourth season, it is plainly very popular but, needless to say, we shant be delving further into the Lost Girl universe. Roll on Season 3 of Grimm!!",1421539200,,1813,4.921568627450981

I Love this show from season 1 - 3. The writing style is struggling a little on a few episodes but enjoyable to watch.

**SPOILER ALERT*** They decide to kill off interesting characters in season 4 But kept the tiresome relationship between Bo and (INSECURE) Lauren alive? EW! Enough already! I have no problem with two women being in love and my review is NOT because its about two women. Regardless of gender their relationship is based on ""lust"" and insecurity"". Its disgusting! 3 seasons of that master and slave relationship is too much! IF the writers need Bo to be in a Lesbian relationship then PLEASE get her a better woman to hook up with!!!!!!

It's like watching a master and slave relationship. TIRED as a viewer with Lauren and her jealous whining. WHY DID THEY NOT KILL THAT CHARACTER OFF?? It is an sickening unhealthy relationship that is getting Really OLD to watch. I was relieved when Lauren's girlfriend pulled out of her coma. I thought, GREAT! Moving ON... Also, in Season 1: I really was drawn towards Bo's relationship with Dyson but never understood or believed there was any ""real"" love between her and Lauren, only Sex! All I saw is a ""weak"" human lusting after a superior Fae. Which is fine for awhile but it just didn't make sense to carry that relationship on and on.... It got even more disgusting in Season 3 when Lauren said to her girlfriend ""Bo"" (who needs sex with other Fae to survive) to stay away from Dyson (who is a Fae)??? I mean Ewwww!! What is this?? High school?? Jealous Lauren?...HOW UNATTRACTIVE!! If the writers/ show execs want to turn people OFF to Lesbian relationships then this is the way to do it.

4907792,5,B005ZCI3N4,"In some ways Lost Girl is mindless teenage fantasy entertainment -- as was Buffy. But like Buffy, the show has a political message delivered in an undercurrent of female empowerment that goes beyond the run of the mill super strength and problem-solving skills. This iteration of superhero includes a female lead who embraces her sexuality -- literally uses sex to heal herself.  This is radically opposed to the regressive chastity-only and abstinence programs that have become popular among certain populations, not to mention the popularity of S&M depictions of young women playing a submissive and passive sexual role. I don't know of any other portrayals of young women that depict them as smart, strong, in control, and unabashedly enjoying sexuality as such a central theme in their character. The buddy partnership between the lead and her sidekick includes witty and cutting-edge repartee that adds to the growing body of work chronicling women's friendships.",1403740800,2,968,5.326797385620915

I really can't say a single bad thing about this. Loved it.

Update 11/15- Having rewatched the season recently, I found it just as good the 2nd time around, minus finding that with the gift of hindisght, I took the other side of the main love triangle than I did the first time I watched it.

4907801,4,B005ZCI3N4,"Funny what a sick day home and Netflix will do for your viewing pleasure!!  I have finally given in to a show I didn't think I would like! The f/f element is a strong appeal for me in this Canadian series... so whether or not the lead gets to have a real passion and relationship with another woman at some point will be something I'm following in this series.  There will be some light spoilers when I discuss the relationship focus.  Overall, I can tell you that this season focuses most on the relationship between a male/female couple and the f/f aspect doesn't get to have the same passion or emotional focus.  But there is still some hot and fun-to-watch f/f chemistry goin' on.

I was hooked from the very first episode.  Bo snagged my attention and just never let go, lol.  Sexy and alluring Bo Dennis (Anna Silk) and all her lovely curves and cleavage couldn't be a truer representation of the seductive succubus who feeds off the sexual energy of others.  She definitely makes the show worth watching.  Love the way they dress her.  This woman is everything I always wanted Mary Louise Parker to be, lol.

In season 1, Bo is a wandering bisexual female demon who doesn't really know herself or what she's capable of.  She's spent the last decade ditching unintended corpses and trying to find answers about her identity and that of her true parents.  She is quickly paired up with her human sidekick, Kenzi, a wisecracking and witty thief of Russian origin and they bond like true sisters in no time.  Yet her last corpse also puts her on the Fae radar... an established secret order of supernatural beings who live among humans and are strictly divided between light and dark.  And they insist this rogue succubus choose a side.  Fast.

Instead, our Lost Girl (who seems an easy choice for Light Fae, in my opinion) chooses neutral ground and starts up her own paranormal private investigator service with Kenzi for The Fae.  With the help of one hunky wolf/shapeshifting police detective and his own male siren sidekick... this little Scooby Gang battles different supernatural forces in each episode, garnering quite the name for themselves.  It's a supernatural drama with some very comedic undertones.

Now the show is full of adult level violence and sexuality.  Every time our Bo is physically hurt in any way, she turns to sexy were detective Dyson for some sexual healing (hmm.  Is it me or does this guy look like a sexy version of the cowardly lion?!).  There isn't full on nudity, but it still gets pretty graphic and has partial nudity.  She could get that healing from anywhere, male or female, but these two have fallen for each other in the guise of a Friends With Benefits connection.  Dyson is Bo's primary relationship and wherever else she ends up, sexually, her heart belongs to Dyson.

On the outskirts of Bo's primary relationship with Dyson, is Dr. Lauren Lewis (Zoie Palmer)... a lovely and brilliant human doctor and scientist owned/employed by The Ash (leader of the Light Fae).  Lauren examines Bo and basically helps Bo throughout the season in understanding herself (and occasionally in solving cases)... but I didn't think this support was fully or realistically developed... bit of a neglected thread, in my opinion.  And while genuine sparks do fly between these two (they certainly have the eye contact down), it's disappointing how this thread actually plays out.  There is always some plot turn making it impossible for these two to be together.  Besides, Bo's heart belongs to Dyson in season 1.  And no one else.  However, I'm loving it that Lauren's character is played by an out lesbian in real life.  Awesome!

Now we get the occasional f/f connection when Bo is manipulating someone with her sexual powers by turning them on and/or sucking out their life-force.  This is shown by touch or a pseudo kiss (they were real kisses in the opening shows and then turned to fake ones where lips don't actually touch, lol)... her ""victims,"" in turn, are willing to cough up any information on Bo's case at hand.  There is also one f/f/m threesome (not actually shown) which Bo only engages in to piss Dyson off.

Bo and Lauren do hook up one time in this season (and again in future seasons)... but it's nothing as graphic as anything shown in the passion between Dyson and Bo.  And the next morning... the plot is such that it ensures Bo's emotions stay true to Dyson.  Honestly, I thought the sex scene was the least sexy connection that passes between these two.  They have heavier chemistry in some of the passing eye contact and subtle touching.  Very sensuous stuff.  A genuinely queer attraction and not just a man-cave inspired thread.  However, the overall connection/romance between these two (or lack thereof) in this season caters to the straights and a straight romance.  Bo wants Dyson.  Period.  There is nothing equal about the split of Bo's affection.  Like most bisexuals I've ever known, her passion and preference is for guys.  Bo's hook ups with women involve some man-inspired ulterior motive on *someone's* behalf, diffusing anything truly genuine or valid about them.  It may be otherwise portrayed in later seasons, but not in this one.

For the lez community, it's really more of a teaser.  So disappointing for us lesbians who would like to see two sexy females as the primary (or hell, even equal) focus.  This is why I don't like to read romances with f/f/m content... the bisexual's heart and emotions is always most loyal to the male.  meh...

Sexuality aside, it's still a very fun show to watch.  Paranormal 101 here and you get introduced to and given the profile of all kinds of interesting creatures across the light/dark spectrum... a nice component for viewers like me with very little supernatural folklore experience.  Bo is just learning about her own kind and she takes us along on that ride.  It's campy and cheesy as all hell, lol... low budget special effects.  But the characterizations are so creative, appealing, and well-done... and the chemistry they all share is so palpable... they all just bring the show to life.  It reminds me of Xena for this reason.  You just fall in love with the characters and don't mind the silliness and cheap effects (and I think there's like 2-3 different primary settings the whole season).  Occasionally the writing is fabulous and the wit (particularly from Kenzi's character) is sharp.  Even so, I'm guessing this is probably one of those love it or hate it shows... and if f/f is a problem for you, don't watch this.

Final thoughts... Way to go Canada!!  lol.  Despite the man-centered bisexual element in this season, I still think an unapologetic bisexual heroine is some groundbreaking stuff. Just don't expect Bo to have a real commitment with another woman until Season 3.  Even then....",1398556800,3,6822,4.804982817869416

4907804,5,B005ZCI3N4,"Although I like the main character, I found that her ""sidekick"" Kenzi, really brought it together. I tend to like supernatural shows anyway, but this one had an interesting and ""sexy"" twist by making the main character, Bo, a Succubus. Essentially, she uses sexual energy to sustain herself, and so sex can lead to many amazing things like healing otherwise deadly wounds. It's not a graphic show though, and it never feels like a porn video, but it can get a little steamy.

Overall this felt like an underrated show. Or maybe I just don't read the entertainment news enough and it actually it getting a lot of attention and accolades, in which case I am happy for it. If you like supernatural shows with some complicated romance, a plucky and enjoyable sidekick, and some action... this right here is for you.",1396569600,,811,4.711267605633803
4907805,5,B005ZCI3N4,"Lost Girl is a suspenseful and exciting Sci-Fi TV series. There is lots of action and some pretty intense romance.

Bo, who is our heroine, is a succubus. Raised by humans, she had no idea until a few Fae find one of her victims. Bo is ordered to stay put so the others can keep an eye on her and an eye out for her. She makes new friends as she searches for her history and lineage. Her drive to right some wrongs gains her powerful allies and plenty of enemies.

Among the crew of friends is Kenzi. Kenzi is great. She is best friend to Bo and she happens to be human. By and far she is my favorite character. Never boring and always brave. Completely crazy and fiercely loyal. She doesn't let her ""normalcy"" slow her down.

I am leaving everything out as far as the love story goes. It is just so hard to only say a little. The best I can say, is it is hot, passionate and intense. If you liked Buffy as a teen, you will love this.",1396051200,,934,4.065217391304348

4907815,1,B005ZCI3N4,"If you are looking to watch an authentic sci-fi supernatural thriller, don't bother with this series. A truly hopeless disappointment. First of all, the plot is so juvenile in depth and thought that it could have been written by a first grader. The series is advertised as a supernatural sci-fi in the likes of True Blood, but it lacks everything from authenticity to talent. The script is robotic and childish; the actors did not fare better. In my opinion, the series might have been redeemed a little bit if the acting was slightly up to par. But unfortunately, the only actor that had any talent on the set was the one who played ""Dyson"", the romantic interest of the lead female role played by Anna Silk.
Finally, the series was misrepresented as detailing the unusual life of a bi-sexual seductress succubus who kills her partners after having sex with them.. But I warn you, the closest thing to seduction going on here is an occasional swapping of saliva and ""blue fumes"" between Bo (Anna Silk) and her ""victims"". No sex ever occurs. No details about how kissing kills her victims. Just lame rhetoric and a lot of over-acting. Finally, a lot of inconsistencies in the script. For example, Bo is supposed to sexually influence people by simply touching them I guess the producers forgot about that numerous times in Season 1 when she touches so many people including her human friend Kenzi, withou the ""magic"" sexual influence occurring.

The only complaint I have with the Blue Ray version specifically is in many scenes, there's a grainy appearance to them. When there's a dark background or when dark clothing is close to the screen, there's a grainy texture that appears and tends to kinda flicker. But when there's a bright/clear scene, the quality looks great. I think the quality of the blue ray did not meet HD standard. If it did, it would look better than the clear picture on TV. I have yet to see the DVD version so I don't know if this issue exists, but I believe someone else complained about this grainy texture. I know it's not my flat screen, because I don't have issues with the other 20+ blue rays I own.

4907825,5,B005ZCI3N4,"After seeing the wretched show Bitten I have a renewed appreciation for Lost Girl.  Despite the unfortunate way Lost Girl is advertised it is not what many may think.  It's an intriguing urban fantasy in the vein of Dresden Files.  It has strong, well-written female protagonists who are actually likable and with well developed and realistic personality types.  I strongly recommend Lost Girl.

The show deals with the misadventures of a woman who discovers she is a part of the world if the sidhe (faery folk) and is pressured to choose a side in a battle between Light vs. Dark.  She chooses her own path and takes it upon herself to work as a sort of private investigator, protecting innocent people from the cruelty of the supernatural world.  The main character, Bo, is a great deal like a cross between Harry Dresden and Thomas Raith from The Dresden Files.

I was also pleased to see one character who could take on the form of a literal wolf as opposed to the obnoxious TV and movie trope of the bipedal man-wolf..",1392681600,,1023,4.644444444444445

If you're an open-minded adult looking for some passionate love scenes in the supernatural world, this is the show for you. The characters are more than just supernatural beings, they have depth. The cast has great chemistry, especially Bo (Anna Silk) and Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried). The love scenes between them are extremely passionate. This season is about learning and bonding for Bo the Succubus. You definitely have to be comfortable with girl-on-girl love scenes or this may not be the show for you. The fight scene could be better but the plot is good enough that you hardly notice. Her sidekick Kenzi (Ksenia Solo) is witty, loyal and fun. She adds light to what could potentially become too much seriousness. By the way, if you like season one, you'll love season two.  However, I've grown bored with the girl-on-girl in season 3.

4907828,5,B005ZCI3N4,"Lost Girl is an absolutely wonderful show and a wonderful ""adaptation"" of mythical creatures and things of that nature.  I LOVE the way they take creatures/beings/ect. and make them into humanoid type characters.  For instance, some of the characters they've ""adapted"" into human/fae characters is just so creative! Some of the characters I never would have imagined them able to talk or much less turn into a ""walking, talking, thinking"" type person, but Lost Girl has managed to pull it off in such a fascinating, interesting, and creative way.  I would definitely recommend this brilliant show to all those who like magical, exciting, fantasy, mythical, captivating tales because it seems to have it all.  Not to mention some ""steamy/sexy"" type scenes they have managed to keep exciting yet not too over the top.  :)  Season 5 is the final/last season and while it has just started, I already feel sad knowing this is it. However, I am still enjoying every single episode and moment left.  In my humble opinion, the Lost Girl series is worth purchasing.  I bought them digitally through Amazon but I hope to get a DVD type box set with all the seasons together and hopefully there will be lots of ""extras,"" ""blooper reels,"" and maybe even some alternate endings.  Of course I would wait until the series is actually all the way over. :)  At the very least, watch the first episode of the first season and if you like that then you will like all of it, but if you don't then you're not gonna like it at all. Right from the first episode it will have you hooked if you enjoy this type of genre.  I hope this review will help someone that likes this kind of stuff because I can honestly say it is easily my favorite series and I would hate for someone to miss out on such an awesome show just because I am not a good writer.

The setting is the unseen world of the Fae (both light and dark) and the interactions they have with humans. The protagonist is a Succubus, a Fae that feeds on human sexual energy (way to bury the lede!) This is season 1 and season 4 is just around the corner.

I'd recommend this to people who enjoy shows like Buffy (my all-time favorite show) - shows with a good mix of humor and drama, with likeable and capable characters you can -care- about. This show's got a great first season, as well, because they waste no time - even here there's a lot of foreshadowing and references to bigger events going on behind the scenes, and some big plot threads come in with plenty of time to flesh out and grab your interest. It's got some good writing, even for the standalone episodes - it's impressively good at making you care even about characters that only come in for one episode. As for the main characters, they're extremely well-written and very funny; any scene where they can play off each other is great (and they get plenty of opportunities to do this).

All in all this is a show I'd recommend - give it a chance and you'll probably find yourself really happy with it.",1375488000,2,1166,4.495283018867925

This though is a massive let down. Bo is a succubus, but she may as well have been written as a vampire - there's nothing new here. Anna Silk does a pouty Angelina Jolie impression in the lead role, she wafts through all her sexual encounters looking bored and wooden. The rest of the cast are no better. The characters don't mesh, and nothing can persuade me to care about them. You can't blame the actors though, the whole production looks rushed and a script is more than a few supposedly witty one liners.

So while I rate the show a solid 4 1/2 stars for content (it IS, after all, a hot 'n sexy show about a succubus who is trying to find out where she belongs in life, surrounded by equally hot and quirky characters), I give them 1 star for not accommodating the hearing impaired.",1370476800,4,655,4.266129032258065

It's easy to empathize with the characters.  Anna Silk's portrayal of Bo is great.  But I would have to say that my favorite character is Ksenia Solo's Kenzi.  She's funny, witty, and adds a little extra 'oomph' to every scene she is in.  Plus, I knew someone who acted just like her, so it was easy for me to enjoy Kenzi.

4907945,5,B005ZCI3N4,"Lost Girl has been compared to Joss Whedon's Buffyverse, and it does have some of the humor that made Buffy such a delight but is closer in tone to the darkness of Angel and goes beyond that in terms of sophisticated characters, plot arcs, universe and politics. Many reviewers are putting the adults only label on the series due to the fact that the protagonist is a succubus and the series does have sexual zing, but I am adding the adult label because there is enough here for the well-versed fantasy reader and viewer to analyze and enjoy.

Pilots that introduce a complex universe are notoriously difficult to write, film and act. Lost Girl grabs the viewer in the first thirty seconds and never lets go. It is one of the best pilots I've seen in a long while. Bo is a succubus, but when we meet her, Bo is a bartender rescuing a patron who has been roofied and is on her way to raped, killing the attacker using her succubi powers, which are caught on camera phone by the hapless victim to be, Kenzi. The next morning the two confront each other  and team up against the detectives that are now searching for them both, thanks to the dead body Bo left behind.

It turns out, that Bo, adopted as a baby is part of a world known as the Fae, which encompasses every creature of many world mythologies as required for the plot. The interpretations of the legendary and mythical creatures of all cultures is clever and fun. Ensemble characters have well developed personalities and even minor characters stand out. I especially liked the Oracle (""Channeling gives me such cotton-mouth!"")

The weekly plot revolves around Bo's refusal to align herself with either the light or dark Fae. Her neutrality makes her valuable in solving problems that handled by another character might dent the fragile peace between the sides and she ends up functioning as a sort of supernatural private detective. Her wolfman lover, Dyson and his sidekick siren are strategically placed on the local police force. This plot set-up should be stale by now, but here feels as fresh as the first time a writer conceived it, which is saying something. Longer arcs focus on the mystery of Bo's birth and parents, partially solved in the first season, the politics of the light and dark Fae and Bo's purpose and relationship to the world of Fae and humans.

Is there sex? Sure and as Bo is a succubus, not all of it is heterosexual as her focus is the sexual energy of a person rather than their gender. If you are even a little sensitive to same sex attraction, this show isn't for you, though the lesbian scenes aren't written or played for male titillation. All of the actors and actresses are exceptionally gorgeous, even with their clothes on and the whole thing, plot, character, pretty, short and long story arcs, urban fantasy universe that uses old myths in a new way...all of it makes for some amazing television. Highly recommended to fans of urban fantasy and mythology.",1363305600,,2956,4.666026871401152

Bo:  Hot.  Great character and acting.
Kensi:  Superhot.  Great.
Blood King:  COOL.
Werewolf:  Cool.  Sometimes acting a bit rough.
Siren:  Was OK, until made Ash.  Then character is a bit lame.
Doctor: OK.  Nice.  Character is clingy and crummy.

Lesbian tilt would be ok, but is a bit over the top sometimes.  Too much so.

The first episode of Lost Girl was truly amazing. I fell in love with the show the minute I laid eyes on Bo (Anna Silk) and was hopelessly lost when I met plucky, street wise Kenzi (Ksensia Solo). Where and when have you ever seen a show daring enough to make the main character a bisexual sex chi sucking succubus??

The chemistry between Anna and Ksensia (sorry if I'm spelling that wrong) is alone worth watching this show for. It comes out in their characters and is wonderful to watch. You feel like they really care about each other. Like they're family. And that's something neither of them has had in a really long time.

There are some plot holes... better scripts then others... and actors struggling to define their characters... but... I kept watching, and season 3 - airing now - is so worth it. Anna Silk is sexier than ever and the characters and scripts are stronger than before.

It is NOT for kids. Rated R for sex, partial nudity, and language.

But don't let that stop you. Bo the Succubus, the Fae, and the humans Kenzi and Lauren are worth watching.",1359936000,2,1106,4.5376884422110555
4908019,4,B005ZCI3N4,"We thoroughly enjoyed this show.  Has a female super hero of sorts.  She is fae, so has special powers.  She is a sucubus, which means she can suck the life out of someone.  She also has the ability to touch someone and have them fall under her spell.  She is a good guy though, so uses her powers for good.  There is a power struggle between the good fae and the bad, so the underlying theme is good against evil.  Both sides want her to choose which side she is on, which she refuses to do.  Her trusty side kick is well cast and sometimes steals the show.  Her on again, off again love interest is intriguing.  I liked this show, although they tend to focus too much on same sex relationships and sex in general.  Some nudity and bad language, plus lots of bloody scenes.

++some minor spoilers++

Lost Girl is a good series. It deals more with the fairy tale creatures (but think Grimm, not lighthearted) as well as the sidhe. Oh, and don't think cute little tinker bell like faries, think of the Guillermo Del Toro horror creaures. I mean things like banshees, revenants, lichs, etc.. The actual fae/sidhe (pronounced ""she"") are grim and dangerous creatures. The ""Lost Girl"" is a succubus, so count on allot of sex. I prefer my shows without sex, gay or straight, focusing on the story and creatures instead. Indeed, be prepared for quite a bit of sex of all kinds. It does get to be a bit too much sometimes; as much as I like the series, I find myself skipping rather long sequences. I enjoy running into some lesser known horrors and the situations the inspire.
Give it a watch and see what you think. I was hooked after the first episode. This series gets the characters right and the actors seem to enjoy working together. You won't be disappointed.",1358812800,3,1019,4.593406593406593

Assuming that you don't have a problem with the premise (and that you're not expecting HBO/Showtime levels of nudity -- this is a regular cable show), there is a lot to love in Lost Girl. The premise is clever, the cast is talented and it has a very good mix of stand-alone and serialized story lines. I highly recommend it!

The only downside to this season on Blu-ray is the set of bonus features included: they are *lame*. No commentaries, and the cast/crew interviews are edited to be nothing more than sound bites with absolutely no information whatsoever. Even worse, they are broken out individually with no way to play all of them at once.

4908085,2,B005ZCI3N4,"The premise is great (read a book titled Succubus Blues for another take on the whole succubus idea) but the execution disappointed.  Premier started off decent and then went downhill. Bad plots & writing most especially.

I am used to the quality of Castle, Grimm & Once Upon A Time, so was hoping for similar treatment.  Special effects?  Not happy with the placement (or lack thereof) or quality.  Fae effects?  Should have been more and again of bad quality.

As for the characters themselves, there are a few that are a great idea but not fleshed out enough for my liking.  Bar tender is awesome and actually reminds me a lot of Mac in the Dresden Files, especially when it comes to sanctuary and neutral territory.
Light and Dark Fae - barely can tell the difference 'tween the 2 and Bo/Beau is supposed to make a choice between the two?
Kensey - potentially a good character but written more as an irritant or comic/shocking relief instead of being given abit more depth.
The wolf - he's supposed to be a cop?!  HA
The siren - he's also supposed to be a cop?!  Double HA.

Secondly, the portrayal of sexual orientation. It isn't mentioned, it just is. And because it just is, everyone around the main characters also just accept that reality. That sort of mind set is something I feel should be in all walks of life. People are either gay or straight or bisexual, and that's it.

4908126,4,B005ZCI3N4,"In 2010, the Canadian supernatural crime drama known as ""Lost Girl"" premiered on Showcase.  Created by Michelle Lovretta and produced by Prodigy Pictures and Shaw Media, the series would go on to air in other countries in 2011 but in the United States, people had the opportunity to see ""Lost Girl"" in January 2012 on the Syfy channel.

And now the first two seasons of ""Lost Girl"" is available on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation.

VIDEO:

""Lost Girl: Season One"" is presented at 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  The series is shot in digital and for the most part, the series looks very good on Blu-ray!  Some scenes may be a bit soft but overall, the series features great detail on character closeups and black levels are nice and deep.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Lost Girl: Season One"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  For a TV series, ""Lost Girl"" features crystal clear dialogue but during its more action-intense scenes, the series utilizes the surround channels but also LFE.  It's important to note that an entire episode is not immersive, as the majority of an episode is primarily dialogue.  But when those action sequences do take place, that is when things become more immersive and for the most part, ""Lost Girl"" and its lossless soundtrack is well-done!

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Lost Girl: Season One"" comes with the following special features:

  Interview Clips - The following interviews are with Anna Silk (Bo), Kris Holden-Reid (Dyson), Ksenia Solo (Kenzi), Zoei Palmer (Lauren), Rick Howland (Trick), K.C. Collins (Hale), Michelle Lovretta (creator of ""Lost Girl""), Jay Firestone (Executive Producer), Peter Monahan (Executive Producer), Anne Dixon (Costume Designer), David Greene (Director of Photography),, Ian Brock (Production Designer).  I wish the interviews were presented as straight through interviews, but they broken up interviews via segments which are not that long.
  Behind the Scenes - Featuring ten short behind-the-scenes clips.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A very cool and sexy supernatural drama... you will be hooked!

When ""Lost Girl"" first appeared on the SyFy channel, my first impressions was a modern take on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" minus the Scooby gang!

The concept of Fae's with different supernatural abilities living alongside humans and two different factions that are opposed to each other, is quite fascinating, if you are into supernatural dramas.  But what makes ""Lost Girl"" so cool is its characters.

The character of Bo reminds me of Buffy, in the fact that she's beautiful, sexy and can fight!  But unlike Buffy, she is not human, she is a succubus.  But unlike other Fae, she chooses to side with humanity, not choosing one Fae side, she lives her life, the best she can.

Actress Anna Silk exhibits a side that looks so gentle and pure but then later transforms into a vixen that can seduce.

Add the character of Kenzi, the spunky, blunt sidekick who no doubt says what she wants and does what she wants, but yet having the approval and friendship of Bo. Actress Ksenia Solo is excellent for the role and the costume design of this character of having her in different wigs, with different looks but yet maintaining this dark yet spunky image, is very cool!

These two characters are very fun to watch and then you add the man-wolf, Dyson into the mix and things get a bit exciting.

Unlike other supernatural dramas on television, ""Lost Girl"" features profanity and is not afraid to be sexy without having to showcase nudity.  Sure you see a little T&A but its supernatural fan service and audiences who enjoy watching Bo will no doubt be thrilled.

I use the comparison with Joss Whedon's ""Angel"" in terms of the investigative angle of the series.  Both Bo and Kenzi take on cases, which typically are related to Fae's, may it be homicide or abduction cases and more or less, we see the growth of Bo as a character trying to learn about herself and control her abilities (primarily, her thirst of feeding on a person).

So, while the investigative cases plays a big part of the ""Lost Girl"" storyline, so does its theme of sexuality.

Bo needs to feed and Dyson, a wolf-shifter, doesn't mind Bo making out with him or having sexual encounters just enough to feed her.

And of course, it causes concern for Dyson as he knows he shouldn't be having any emotional connection to her because she has not pledged her allegiance to any Fae side.

Then you have Lauren Lewis, the doctor and scientist who wants to help Bo carve her craving to feed.  But at the same time, there is a deep attraction between her and Bo.

Suffice to say, Bo tends to be able to touch people and make them want to be with her.  Succubus abilities that need to be conquered when her body needs to feed and an ability she is trying to control.

The first season of ""Lost Girl"" is quite entertaining and with only 13-episodes for the first season, by the season finale, all hell breaks loose and no doubt will set the pace for Bo in the second season.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Lost Girl"" looks very good on Blu-ray and the lossless track is actually pretty good considering a lot of series are front-channel driven.  As for special features, it looks like there is a lot, but for some reason, each Q&A is separated as an individual interview feature.  I wish they just had the interviews with the option of ""play all"" versus of having to select each interview one by one, because some of them are just too short!  Better yet, why not one full interview with each cast or crew, instead of breaking up the interviews questions.  This also goes for the ""Behind-the-Scenes"" which are short but no option to ""play all"".

Other than that, ""Lost Girl: Season One"" was a lot of better than I expected and I'm looking forward to season 2.  Not all Canadian supernatural series do all that well in the U.S., ""Blood Ties"" while popular in Canada, fizzled in the U.S.  But I think it does help for ""Lost Girl"" that it is presented on the Syfy channel versus ""Lifetime"", the cable channel that ""Blood Ties"" was featured.

But while there are similarities to shows such as ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" with ""Lost Girl"", it's a totally different series and because it is shown on cable, writers can utilize mature language and feature more sexuality which is part of the efficacy of ""Lost Girl"".

A mature, sexy and action-packed supernatural series... ""Lost Girl: Season One"" is recommended!",1354320000,3,6484,4.799819657348963

4908131,5,B005ZCI3N4,"This Canadian television show about a supernatural world (the Fae) that exists in secrecy among humans is so different from the typical fantasy TV show that it grabbed my attention immediately. It incorporates mythologies and cultural folklores; however, they are the ""Lost Girl"" version of myths and legends. It has characters, action, and escapades that are enthralling and entertaining. The creator and producers have described the series as a supernatural crime drama with light comedy and it definitely lives up to their description.

The protagonist of Lost Girl is Bo (Anna Silk), a bisexual succubus that was adopted and raised by human parents. A succubus is a creature that must feed on the ""chi"" (the life force) of humans and Fae to survive; and when injured absorbs the chi and energy created during sexual encounters to heal. Being the modern version of the mythical succubus, Bo feeding or healing from either a male or female is irrelevant because it's all sexual healing to her. Bo accidentally killed her high school boyfriend by draining his chi during her first sexual encounter and it was after this incident that her parents told her she had been adopted. Thereafter, Bo fled from home and everything she had known, living a friendless existence, accumulating a history of chi-drained bodies; moving from city to city and creating a new identity each time.

Bo saves a human woman, Kenzi (Ksenia Solo), from a rapist by draining his chi and when she realizes what Bo did for her, the two become instant friends (with Kenzi as Bo's streets-smart sidekick). This kill brings the heretofore unknown Bo to the attention of the local Fae clans. The Fae are powerful supernatural beings that have existed in secrecy among humans since the beginning of civilization, despising and using them for their own benefit. Their world is divided into two clans, the Light and Dark, with the Dark being the most evil and criminally-inclined of the two; however, although the Light Fae are more diplomatic, both sides use humans as slaves, servants, and food. Bo is abducted by two Fae police detectives and brought to the Light Fae leader, The Ash, for interrogation. It is here that Bo discovers that she is not the only one who is `different'. It is also here that she meets her future romantic lovers, the wolf-shifter and police detective, Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried); and Lauren (Zoie Palmer), the human physician & scientist obligated to serve The Ash. When the Ash orders Lauren (Dr. Lewis) to examine Bo and determine what kind of Fae she is, Bo is told by Lauren that she is a succubus and that, if she wanted to, she could learn to control her chi-feeding power and sexual drive. Each clan wants Bo to align herself with one or the other, but after being forced to defend herself in a contest trial, Bo refuses to abandon her ties to humanity and determines to search for the truth about her origins and who she really is. Rounding the cast of central characters are Trick (Richard Howland), owner and bartender of the local Fae tavern, ""The Dal Riata""; and Hale (K.C. Collins), a siren & police detective working alongside Dyson. Minor characters include The Morrigan (Emmanuelle Vaugier), vengeful leader of the Dark Fae with an instant dislike of Bo; and Vex, a mesmer serving as the henchman for The Morrigan, and a darling of the Dark Fae Elders.

The women of Lost Girl are strong, resourceful, and live their lives on their own terms. The interpersonal relationships between men and women are equal in status in spite of their differences. Compared to the sex scenes involving Dyson, the first lovemaking scene between Bo and Lauren may seem tame, but it is nevertheless intense. (Fact: The pilot for the show later became Episode 8 of Season 1, and contains the initial lesbian love scene between Bo and Lauren. Regardless of what naysayers may say, from the outset the relationship with Lauren was intended to be as essential to Bo's emotional evolution as her relationship with Dyson.)

Along with the creatures, adventures, rolls in the hay, cleavage, and Bo's intrepid journey to find her place in the world with the family she creates along the way, Lost Girl is very much about a sex-positive universe where sexual orientation is not judged. The core nature of Fae and humans, and their interconnections, are not affected by any one of them being bisexual, heterosexual, or homosexual.

Lost Girl is produced by Prodigy Pictures for Canada's Showcase TV network and broadcast by the Syfy TV network in the United States, United Kingdom (UK and Ireland), and Australia. The DVD & Blu-ray contain the unedited episodes as shown on Canadian television (Season 1 has 13 episodes; Season 2 has 22 episodes; Season 3 has 13 episodes). Episodes running time: 44 minutes.

(Unhappy news about the Blu-ray I received: when I opened the package all three discs were covered with dust, with the third disc having the most on it. I dusted them off and played the third disc first and the sound quality of the first episode, particularly the voices of male actors, was slightly distorted in several scenes.)",1351987200,2,5265,4.895739910313901

4908138,4,B005ZCI3N4,"A must have for those Sci-Fi/Fantasy lovers out there, especially those who once loved Buffy and Angel - two series Lost Girl is constantly compared to. It is, however, targeted to a more mature audience, given its sexual content. Bo (played brilliantly by Anna Silk) is a Succubus raised by humans that runs away from home once she drains her first boyfriend to death. Ten years later, she is found and targeted by the Fae when suspiciously leaving a body behind after protecting human sidekick Kenzi (Ksenia Solo) from a man at a local bar. Bo soon learns that the Fae are divided between Light and Dark and refuses to make a choice -- which is a parallel to Bo's own sexuality; a bisexual Succubus, constantly torn between two lovers: Light Fae detective Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried) and human doctor Lauren (Zoie Palmer). The first season is about Bo's search for her true identity as we are introduced to the Fae world and its various secrets and ramifications.

The love triangle is one of the show's biggest draws, particularly because both lovers bring something different to the table: Dyson, the territorial alpha male, provides sexual healing - literally - in an electrifying friends with benefits relationship with Bo. Lauren, the fragile, geeky beta female, provides the human warmth and emotional connection/support Bo so desperately needs. The latter is particularly satisfying because Bo and Lauren's relationship isn't played for male titillation; it is straightforward, it is real and it resonates with the audience. Their chemistry is heart-wrenching and beautiful and fortunately, only a taste of what's to come in season 2.",1344384000,8,1640,5.096654275092937

4908162,5,B005ZCI3N4,"On the grimy streets of Toronto, there are magical, ancient beings that humans are not even aware of.

And as a young succubus named Bo discovers, a life among them is a dangerous, weird one. ""Lost Girl Season 1"" is a brilliant premiere season for a very unique, sexy and gritty series, which imagines all mythical creatures as various breeds of fae -- and between the strong cast and witty writing, it's an absolute joy.

For years, Bo (Anna Silk) has drifted from city to city, sucking the life-force from people via sex/kisses. But after she rescues a young thief named Kenzi (Ksenia Solo) by killing an attempted rapist, she is captured by the Fae leaders, the Ash (light Fae) and the Morrigan (dark Fae). Since she has no idea who she is, they put her to an ancient test.

But Bo chooses neither the Light nor the Dark. She still gets some allies among the Fae, including werewolf cop Dyson (Kristen Holden-Ried), human doctor Lauren (Zoie Palmer) and the pleasant but mysterious bartender Trick (Rick Howland).

Because she belongs to neither side, Bo and Kenzi turn out to be perfect supernatural detectives: missing college girls, a jealous fury, missing treasure, a body-hopping Hsien, a fae-killing toxin, a crooked country club, a spider with a deadly power, a family feud, a string of supernatural suicides, and Dyson being accused of murder. And while she does this, Bo searches for her mysterious origins -- only to find that the truth is much worse than she could have imagined.

A show about the adventures of a beautiful young succubus sounds... well, like the premise for a porn movie, not a fantasy-noir series. But while it has some steaminess (sometimes played for laughs), ""Lost Girl"" is mainly about Bo solving various odd cases among the Fae, even as she searches for her family.

But it has a lot of deliciously funny moments, usually from Kenzi (""Best case scenario: I am a toe-sucking cannibal!"") and there's a running love triangle between Bo, Lauren and Dyson. And the setting has a gritty, punky urban feel, with Bo and Kenzi living in a boarded-up ""crack shack"" and and dressing in lots of leather.

And the cast of this series is really superb -- Silk manages to be sensual without being cartoonish, especially since Bo is a genuinely nice person with deep-rooted morals. Holden-Ried is amazing as the hard-nosed cop who falls completely in love with her; and Howland is AWESOME -- half kindly bartender, half hidden power. The one actor I couldn't quite connect with was Palmer, who always has a weird half-smirk on her face.

But the star of the series is Ksenia Solo. She steals every scene she's in with her quirky, clever, sometimes light-fingered Kenzi, who manages to stay afloat in Fae society despite being human.

""Lost Girl Season 1"" is one of the best urban-fantasy series of recent years -- gritty and magical, sexy and spooky. Just don't show it to the kids.",1341014400,19,2904,4.780439121756487
4908163,3,B005ZCI3N4,"While I appreciate the vastly underused (and downright refreshing) Fae atmosphere and intriguing characters within the enriched universe, I have one beef with it. I've been watching the series on SyFy, and enjoy most of the show except for the character Kenzi. Her wit is supposed to be sharp, dark, and self-serving, but I consistently find myself annoyed by her and her actions. More often than not, it's her mistakes that get Bo, Dyson, and others into trouble. I understand she's there to provide the human element (i.e. our gateway into Bo's life), but would it have killed the writers to actually make Kenzi likeable? I continue to watch the show, but think after so many near misses with death, Kenzi would smarten up a bit.",1339113600,3,731,4.809523809523809

4908165,5,B005ZCI3N4,"I was introduced to this series by a friend and I was stunned. I watch very little TV  but this is phenomenal. Gritty, a bit dark, occasionally campy, very sexy (yes, there's sex in it, well done from my perspective) with a bi-sexual succubus, a human sidekick, and a truly excellent supporting cast. I thoroughly enjoy them all and watching how the cast grows together, creating a connected and charismatic group. The succubus, Anna Silk (does anyone else see her distinct resemblance to Andrea Parker? I honestly thought they must be related) is an excellent choice and I really enjoy that she has a real body, curves and all. No stick legs or flat chest for her and I can only wish the US would follow suit. Go Canada!!!",1336694400,26,723,4.604651162790698
4908166,5,B005ZCI3N4,"I already have a call into the ""Guinness Book of World Records, as Bo (Anna Silk) has to hold the non cable single season series record in the category for the number of minutes of highlighted cleavage!  Ms. Silk's impressive display of rack-age aside, this is a very, very good show.

Wise cracking Kenzie (Ksenia Solo) who is no ""slouch"" in her own right, plays Bo's side kick and works the role in a similar manner to Charisma Carpenter in ""Angel"".

Casting Bo as bi-sexual was a smart scripting move, as it can only broaden her fan base!

The supporting cast is very good and the show is consistently bringing in new characters with different powers to keep things interesting.

This show has a soon to be concluding 2nd season and has already been green lighted for a 3rd.  I don't that anyone cares all that much that Anna Silk is playing a character much younger.  In reality, she is actually 4-years older than the actress that plays her mother!  Then again, this is a fantasy series and the person(s) in charge of wardrobe know what they are doing.

It is interesting to me that this Canadian produced show is only available on Amazon as an Australian import?  Perhaps with The SyFy Network broadcasting Lost Girl, the series will be more readily available.",1335484800,7,1266,4.63677130044843
