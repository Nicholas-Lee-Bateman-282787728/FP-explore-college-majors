2582187,5,B000FQISSU,"This is an anime series about a group of boarding school friends who fight the evil, XANA, inside the ""super computer"". The show has both 2d and 3d like animation.

2582188,4,B000FQISSU,"I have to hold my hands up and say tha I am probably the oldest Code Lyoko fan out there at 26!

I got introduced to the show when I was channel hopping and have been hooked since!

Although the overall context of the show is very simple - stop evil and save the world, there are so many other shows like this out there - the premise that it should take place in a virtual world is quite clever, taking into account the current level of technological knowledge.

I was a tiny bit disappointed to find that there are few extras on the third disc; I love extras and feel that it falls a little short in this area. I would give it a 5* rating if not for this small and - to me - not so insignificant fact!

Although, having all 26 episodes for the cost of a regular DVD - stellar! For fans of the show, I cannot recommend this highly enough. But for fans of DVD extras, I'd still recommend it, but you only get the same extras as are on the other 3 DVDs.

2582189,5,B000FQISSU,"I am 17 and I still watch Code Lyoko every day on Cartoon Network.  In the first few seasons, the plot is a bit repetative and every storyline is essentially the same.  But it gets really good towards the later seasons, especially after both Aelita and XANA have been freed from the Super Computer.  XANA trys to destroy Lyoko and has escaped into the Internet.  I really loved the episode ""XANA Awakens,"" a wonderful 2-part episode that explains how Jeremy discovers Lyoko and how everything got started.  It's a fun show.",1160265600,,523,4.7032967032967035

However... The entire DVD is in Japanese. States the Product Details. ""Language: Japanese""

All the other DVD's Vol 1 - Vol 3 are in both in English and Japanese. Is it a mistake or not? I love the show but I don't think I'll enjoy it as much listening to Odd, Ulrich, Yumi, Jeremie and Aelita speaking Japanese the entire time for 26 episodes.",1154908800,3,428,4.271604938271605
2582192,1,B000FQISSU,"This is not a good show. It's watchable, in the same way that Yu-Gi-Oh is watchable. If you're bored and, like me, willing to watch any show with a dangling subplot (in this case, whether the character of Aelita can be brought from the virtual world into the real world) that doesn't insult your intelligence overmuch, then you can sit through it.

We follow four children, Jeremy, Yumi, Ulrich, and Odd (yes, really) as they attend grade school and battle X.A.N.A. - an unseen presence in the virtual world who wreaks havoc in the real world, and can only be kept at bay by Aelita and generous amounts of stock footage. Each episode follows the same format: X.A.N.A. attacks, kids go into virtual world to protect defenseless Aelita. Aelita finds and deactivates a tower in some random location, which somehow translates to X.A.N.A. being defeated... for the moment. At the end of the episode, a literal reset button is hit, rewinding time to the moment before the attack, erasing the memories of all but the four children (plus Aelita), and undoing any damage, including death. Yes, characters occasionally die and are frequently about to die when the deus ex machina is activated. It's all very suspenseful, or something.

There's action, romance, and scattered moments of cuteness, but all in all, Code Lyoko can be summed up in one word: pablum. It's nonthreatening, easy listening, entirely missable. Far from the worst thing on TV, especially if you need something to watch with a child, or you are one yourself (in which case it's far more relatable), but it's not worth spending money on.",1153353600,2,1597,4.867647058823529

All of the episodes are in the correct order this time. The video quality is generally good, although I did notice a couple almost unnoticeable artifacts in the video.

The release is completely bareboned - no subtitles, no French language support, no bonus features. Keep this in mind - if you just want the show, it isn't a huge deal, but there isn't an advantage over the Instant Video release except for having a physical copy.

The packaging and labels are extremely generic. Basically just the exact same label on everything with episode titles changed. It's so bad that if I didn't know better, I would think it is a bootleg.

Those complaints aside, this is a good but barebones release of an awesome but hitherto almost unavailable show. Know what you are getting into, but it is a purchase I would make again.",1366156800,,898,4.6645569620253164

Now that I'm watching it again, I'm starting to see what everyone is talking out. The show is great; it does has its flaws, but I still like it. Doesn't have much of a plot going on, so most episodes are filler. It isn't until the last two episodes of the season that the plot is in motion. They really clean up the show in later seasons, but I recommend watching this season first before going on to the next. Great season though!",1357776000,,583,3.9491525423728815

2582223,5,B000FQISSU,"I have been watching this ever since I was little and it was, for a time, the only thing I ever watched on TV. now it's on DVD and I love it. It is about a group of teens who go in to fight a virus on a super computer named X.A.N.A and stop it from coming out and taking over the world. Now I do have to say there are two cons to consider here:

1)The show does get  quite repetitive at times. there is very little change in the main objective to each episode though the objective does change slightly with the next season and a lot with the last two.

2)These videos are printed on DVD-R disks. That means that some DVD players will not be able to play these disks. be sure to know your DVD player and it's limits before buying this.

Overall, I have to say that if your into anime and don't mind the fast talking, repetitive nature, and love computers and science fiction; then this show is a must have.",1352505600,,905,4.067415730337078

2582225,4,B000FQISSU,"The entire first season is composed of filler until you get to the main arc during the last few episodes. They spend the early parts of the episode enjoying teenage life (and its problems) while the evil computer watches them from seemingly every computer in a 5 mile radius. They really don't do much but comic relief  until the evil computer actives a tower in Lyoko and attacks the real world.  Then they sneak away from whatever important thing they are doing (like going to Prom in the 1st episode) to stop the evil computer, XANA, from taking over the world and/or killing everyone in the surrounding area.
The one thing that is a constant throughout the first season is that they have a time machine that they can use to go back to before the catalyst events for XANA's attacks. Which they use every episode after the tower is deactivated. This makes the series repetitive and hard to watch for more than a few episodes at a time, but the action and character interactions during those episodes is good enough to keep you watching thru to the end of the episode.
You may not notice anything significant change if you watch the first episode and then skip to the ending two episodes, as non occurs story-wise in the first season, but this is still a nice season to watch one or two episodes at a time, as the real action doesn't start till season 2.",1341014400,,1355,4.504065040650406
2582246,5,B000FQISSU,"I own both the 2004 and 2011 versions of the first season, and I will compare them for those who are interested.

The 2004 version has a few special features which include a Sector 5 presentation, character profiles, trailers, a season 2 trailer and a holomap of the Lyoko towers.  The 2011 version has no special features.

The 2004 version has the theme song on the menu, the 2011 one does not have any music or sounds at all on the menu.

The 2004 version has a trailer on each disc, before the menu.  Each disc in the 2011 version goes immediatly to the menu, with no trailers.

The 2004 version has 3 discs, with disc 3 being partly under disc 2 (requiring the removal of disc 2 to access disc 3).  The 2011 version has 6 discs, with none under another.

The 2004 version has its episodes out of order, and does not list any episodes on the case, inside pamphlet (if you buy new), or on the back.  You have to go to the episode selection on the disc to see which episodes are on that disc.  The 2011 version has its episodes in order and has all the episodes numbered and listed on the back.  Each disc lists which episodes are on it, and their number (Episode 01 - ""Teddy Gozilla"").

Neither version has subtitles or other languages.

Both versions look and feel professionaly done.

Both versions cases and all the discs look and feel quality and the sound and visuals are fantastic.

All in all, I like the 2011 version more than the 2004 one, if for nothing else then because the episodes are in order and are listed.  If you really like special features you might find it worth it to own the 2004 version, but that's really a matter of opinion (it doesn't have any that I haven't listed).",1336521600,8,1698,4.3428571428571425

2582250,5,B000FQISSU,"This review is primarily meant for those reading through reviews to see if this is worth the risk: It is.

I bought all 4 seasons of Code Lyoko last week (received them at the end of that week in the mail) on a chance. Anything with the disclaimer of ""DVD-R product"" always makes me nervous because I'm not sure of the quality.

1. All episodes in season 1 (I've only had time to watch through season 1 so far) are in perfect clarity. The sound is synchronized like how it is supposed to be. It looks just as good as I remembered when I first started watching it on Cartoon Network about 8-9 years ago.

2. The discs are packaged so each disc has its own little holder. They're not stacked on top of each other like other series that I own, such as Saint Seiya, or Petite Princess Yucie.

3. The artwork on the DVD cover and the discs themselves look professionally done. There is no fading.

4. This is a 6-disc set and the language is set to English. There are no subtitles, and no other dub. I know this bothers some fans, but I prefer it to be in English dub, so this worked out well for me.

5. There are 26 episodes in this set.

6. For those saying that this is a kid's show...I'm 21 years old. I started my brother on this (he's 20) and he loves it as well. This is a good show to watch for any age-range.

2582255,4,B000FQISSU,"""Code Lyoko"" strikes many as, odd. The animation style really stands out amidst the anime-style artwork that many shows boast today, and the switch mid-episode into CGI images is another difference.

However, while the initial season is repetitive, Code Lyoko is an absolute joy to watch. It deals with a group of students living in the French boarding school of Kadic Academy. They're four very different people, bound together by two things: Aelita, and the virtual world she lives on, Lyoko.

The 1st season doesn't really introduce the main characters. Instead, it jumps right into the middle of the action with ""TeddyGodzilla"" and over time we're introduced to the central plot of the season. Jeremie, a gifted student - finds a SuperComputer and an old warehouse. His curiosity getting the better of him, and he turns it on. Inside, is a totally unique virtual world known as ""Lyoko"" which has been divided into four sectors- and contains a sole inhabitant. A virtual AI computer program known as ""Aelita"". Soon - the threat of XANA is introduced. XANA is a computer virus that can possess objects at will, and uses them frequently to attack the main characters.

On Lyoko, the students become colorful warriors to combat XANA's monsters in creative, CGI action sequences. Jeremie tries to come up with a code to allow Aelita to live with them on Earth, so they can shut down the Computer for good.

Where the First series of the show falls short, is the repetitive nature of the episodes. There are some wonderful exceptions. While the plot of the 1st series doesn't keep you watching, the characters do. Each one is unique, and watching them interact as a team is great fun. The plot thickens in the later seasons, as new mysteries are uncovered and new characters are introduced. The CGI too, improves rapidly in S2 of the show. Either way- it's worth a watch. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy the fun either. ;)",1236729600,,1924,4.768768768768769
2582256,5,B000FQISSU,Wow i love this series. It is great to have this on DVD. Now I can watch at any time my favorite show. Great buy! Must Have for a Code Lyoko fan.,1212883200,,145,3.5625
2582257,5,B000FQISSU,"To some, the world of Lyoko is a pathetic excuse for a tv show. I strongly believe that these people have only seen mere fragments of episodes, only resulting in judgement such as ""this show is weird.""

I remember the first day I ever saw this show on tv. I remember thinking ""this show has got to be stupid."" After watching for about 10 minutes, I was exposed to the virtual world that this array of strange characters had entered via a supercomputer. Since that day, I have been engulfed in the series, thus creating a hardcore Lyoko fan.

The first season has been released for some time now, but just got my paws on it today. I'm awaiting the complete second season, and hope it comes out in the near future. If not, I'll be severely discouraged. The seasons following the first have much more superiority and speed, but lack the originality and simplicity of the original's episodes.

I read another review that stated the episodes were out of order. I thought this was inaccurate because the first season had no order until the episode ""Code: Earth"" was presented, only due to the fact that there was a connecting episode, ""False Start.""

As the Code Lyoko series evolves, it unfolds into more confusion for some, but more curiosity and interest for others. The episodes begin to connect as a whole, forming a situated storyline that keeps the viewers begging for more.

Hoping for season two on DVD. Long live Lyoko! (P.S. Odd rules!)",1208131200,,1441,4.65748031496063

2582260,4,B000FQISSU,"As a parent of two children, both under the age of ten, I find myself watching a lot of cartoons. I'm pretty selective about what I choose to expose my kids to; I'm always looking for something unique, intelligent, and of course `safe' for them. It's difficult to wade through the infinite trash out there to find suitable shows, so I'm writing this review to help others evaluate this program, which is not an easy show with which to quickly come to terms. I was slow to warm up to ""Code Lyoko,"" but after spending some time with this program, I find that I'm really drawn to it, despite its flaws, and I'm perfectly fine with my kids watching it.

""Code Lyoko"" is a French animated program translated into English for American audiences (which may explain why it has some rough edges). It is the story of a small group of youngsters living at a boarding school in Northwest France (though that's not obvious in the translated version) called the Kadic Academy. Three of these youths had, sometime before the start of the series, discovered an abandoned factory nearby, in the depths of which lies a mysterious supercomputer whose purpose seems to be to host a virtual world called ""Lyoko.""

Unfortunately, a malevolent program or virus (named X.A.N.A.) within this computer seems intent on doing damage to the ""real world"" by searching for I/O towers (ala Tron) and messing with our reality. The kids would just shut the machine down if it weren't for the fact that they had also discovered in Lyoko a gentle, benevolent feminine entity named Aelita. The genius of the group, Jeremie, is particularly smitten with Aelita, and throughout the first season of the show, is intent on ""de-virtualizing"" Aelita - bringing her into the real world and to safety - so that the computer and the menace within it can be shut down for good.

The individual stories in the first season usually revolve around XANA launching an attack on our world and the kids scrambling to repel it while trying to lead normal lives at the school as best they can. To fight XANA, they ""virtualize"" and go inside the world of Lyoko, assuming various avatar-like personas to battle a variety of creatures so that Aelita can enter the infected I/O tower and enter a shutdown code, stopping the attack.

The show has several good things going for it. It's intelligent without being difficult to follow, even for younger kids. It is rendered in two different animation styles, which is handled well: traditional cell-based animation for the real world, and 3D computer animation for the virtual world. For a show ostensibly aimed at children, the characters have more than the average amount of depth, and are as interesting to watch when they are in school interacting with classmates and teachers as they are battling monsters in the virtual world.

""Code Lyoko"" has no objectionable language, and there is no blood, slime, or peril that I've seen to disturb kids; the clean rendering style and happy music keep the mood light even in the brief battle scenes. About the most I can warn a fellow parent about is that the characters do develop teen relationships, kiss once or twice, etc., but I personally did not see this as anything that would be a problem for my own kids.

Now, the downsides to ""Code Lyoko."" First, beyond this DVD set, it's hard to find. As I write this, it is not being broadcast on any TV station in my area and hasn't been for some time. Even though four seasons have been created to date, only the first season is on DVD, here, with another DVD containing the first few episodes of Season 2 also available. That was released a year ago and we're still waiting for more. Everything I've read tells me that the seasons following the first one are far superior, but just try getting your hands on them.

The next problem is that there is no introduction to the show -- you need to either ""figure it out"" or have someone explain the backstory to you as I have tried to do here. There was a five-minute unaired pilot called ""Garage Kids"" made (check YouTube) but for some reason the events in it were not carried into the actual show, so upon first viewings, you are left a bit cold towards the whole affair. The original DVDs had the episodes wildly out of order, which didn't help, although season one is so episodic that casual viewers might not notice. That's another weakness of the first season: it's a collection of episodes that become formulaic, and I'm lead to believe that the show really ramps up in the seasons following -- I can believe that from what I've seen and read.

A few more annoyances: it takes some getting used to the weird animation style. The characters are all grossly mis-proportioned with HUGE foreheads, odd marks on their faces (mascara?), and often bizarre hair. While the main title music is very catchy, each episode is interrupted, inexplicably, about a dozen times with the first 8 notes of the theme and one of half a dozen stock sequences of one of the kids in motion. Why? It's strange filler that I find very distracting. But you do get used to it, and you'll find yourself humming that theme song after a few episodes.

Probably the biggest flaw in my mind is the fact that, at the end of each episode in the first season, the kids have the option of rolling back time a full day to get themselves out of any difficult situations they may have gotten into. Not only is this the biggest dramatic cheat imaginable, it doesn't even make sense -- how are they doing it, why do they still remember what happened (whether they were in the machine or not), and why can't the time rollback bring people back to life (an implied limitation of the process). Supposedly the following seasons put limits on this ridiculously powerful ability, the biggest single weakness of the show in my opinion, from a dramatic standpoint.

A ""Code Lyoko"" game has been released for the Wii console, but as it follows the events of the fourth season, I don't see how it can do very well in the US unless they release more episodes of this series!

In summary, ""Code Lyoko"" is an interesting show that, because of its rough edges and availability problems, may take a while to warm up to. But if you give it a chance, you may very well become hooked on it, whether you're young or old. It's a superior program in that it is safe for kids and yet intelligent enough for adults to watch, too. But unless they start releasing these DVDs more quickly, ""Lyoko"" is unlikely to become a household word in US homes.",1201478400,2,6513,4.62057044079516
2582261,4,B000FQISSU,"I had no idea so many of this show's fans were adults.  Now I don't feel so silly for watching it!  Woohoo!

The premise of Code Lyoko is fairly simple.  Lyoko is a ""virtual world"" that exists inside a computer; while the scenes that take place in the real world are animated traditionally, the battle scenes on Lyoko are animated using CGI.  The computer also houses XANA, an evil entity that wants to take over the world, which he attempts to do using control towers on Lyoko that allow him to act outside the computer, for instance, by seizing control of government weapons sattelites.  The Lyoko team, a group of young teens who attend the boarding school near the abandoned factory that houses the supercomputer, are the only humans who know of its existence, and they have to find a way to defeat XANA while maintaining their dual lives as ordinary junior high school kids.

The show has its flaws, of course; I don't think there's any such thing as a ""perfect"" TV show, movie, or anything else.  For instance, it becomes obvious fairly quickly that the animators often just reuse bits from previous episodes, which creates the occasional continuity error.  It should also be noted that the English dub occasionally flatly ignores the show's French origins; for example, the characters refer to dollars rather than Euros, and even worse, at one point a character mentions the school having begun a ""language exchange program""--no idea what that is--with France, despite the fact that they already live there.  (In fact, one episode even reveals the school's location via satellite image.  Hard to ignore that...)  These are pretty few and far between, though, and therefore only of consequence to dweebs like me that notice everything.

That being said, Code Lyoko is still pretty darn entertaining, full of humor, action, and even romance.  Plus, there's virtually nothing that's even remotely obscene or offensive about this show, which makes it perfect for family viewing.  (Hey, kids watch Code Lyoko too!  Surprise surprise!)  There's also a clear message of cooperation and trust that binds the series together; the series is set at a boarding school, with students who come from literally every corner of the globe, but the culture of the school is such that the racial and societal differences between them are hardly given a second thought, and occasionally even the main cast's bitter rivals will step in to lend a hand.

The only real flaw as far as the show itself, especially in the first season, is that it relies a little too heavily on the ""deus ex machina"" conceit; any problems that the kids or XANA cause can easily be deleted by travelling back in time.  Also, certain plot holes tend to go unexplained, such as why the abandoned factory was never torn down.  (In fairness, though, the time-travel concept was largely disposed of in later seasons, maybe because the creators realized that their audience was a little more savvy than they'd anticipated.)

Unfortunately, the most glaring flaw with this DVD set is the DVD set itself.  The episodes are thrown together in random order--not a problem for most of the season, but the last few episodes follow a definite arc that's incompatible with out-of-order viewing--and there are far too few extras.  The only audio track, for instance, is the English dub; since this set is sold in Canada as well, I would have thought that including the original French language track would have been an obvious choice, but apparently I'd be wrong.  The saving grace, in fact, is the price tag, far lower than what you'd expect to pay for a full season of just about any other show.

All in all, I wish there were a better place to start if you're new to Code Lyoko; but to be honest, it could be a lot worse.  Of course, I should warn the new viewer that Funimation seems to be taking its time releasing Season 2, if indeed it ever will at all--the second volume of season 2 isn't even mentioned on the Funimation Web site anymore--so you may want to think twice about getting involved if you haven't been keeping up with the TV broadcast.",1189900800,2,4102,4.782978723404256
2582262,5,B000FQISSU,"My title says it all. This is a show that everyone can enjoy, and I don't just mean kids. the story rocks and the animation (traditional animation and computer graphics both) is incredible. I do not see how anyone could not enjoy this.",1188604800,,235,4.488372093023256
2582263,4,B000FQISSU,"Code lyoko is an interesting show, and although they don't quite get the voices right in season 1, in the most recent episodes the voices are lip-synced and really match the characters well. In code lyoko the 5 main characters; Jeremy, Ulrich, Odd, Yumi, and a later entering character who starts out as more of a sub-character Aleita. The 4 kids, not including Aleita for now, stumble upon the supercomputer that contains lyoko, but in this supercomputer's AI program a virus called ZANA has begun to dominate. Zana is a AI program, but his impressive insight into basic human emotions such as jelousy, and hate, make for real trouble, but his ""attacks"" on earth are usually more basic towards the start. Zana is able to control electronic devices and make ""ghosts"", which to the best of my knoweldge are eletromagnetic manefestations of his own mal-intent, these ghosts can take over people, but this doesn't start happening until later. The 4 characters first find this super computer, along with scanners enabling the 4 kids to virtualize into Lyoko, inside an abandoned factory near their bording school. Inside the computer a digital ""paradise"" callde LYOKO exists. Within Lyoko there are 4 main towers, and numorus towers that zana temporarily creates. These towers allow Zana to link to the real world. He gaurds these towers with monsters, and the 5 characters have to fight against these monesters. Lyoko is a rather pretty place, in the show the characters are rendered in a sort of 3D computer-animated hybrid, and are geared with weapons to fight the monsters that Zana creates (if they take to many hits they devirtualize, and end up back in the strange factory). In Lyoko there are five sectors; the mountain sector, the forest sector, the arctic sector, the desert sector, and Zana's home base sector 5, or Carthage. If the characters fall of of the land area of these sectors they will end up in the ""Digital Sea"" and dezirtualize permanatly and will not return to earth. Zana constantly faces them with new problems and challanges while they try to virtualize Alita who is trapped on Lyoko. Overall a good show i rated 4 out of 5 because the episodes are out of order, and this 1st season does not include the first episode.",1186185600,,2242,4.841145833333333

2582274,4,B000FQISSU,"Code Lyoko is the kids ""anime"" shown on Cartoon Network and France 3. While the show aims for younger viewers, it has found a small cult following of twentysomethings. If you're a fan of the show, this is a must buy, especially considering that 26 episodes of any other show would cost you $30 or more (emphasis on the more).

NOTE: THE DVD IS IN ENGLISH! I have no idea why Amazon has the language listed as Japanese. It's not even made in Japan.

Pros:

1) Every episode from season 1 at a great price.

Cons:

1) No Fun-imation didn't arrange the episodes in any particular order. While not a big deal for season 1, as there is no real story arc until the last few eps, it's really grating to have to keep flipping discs to watch the eps in the original order.

2) While the animation looks crisp and great on my home entertainment system, it looked pixelly (not a word, I know), fuzzy, and blotchy on my computer. This isn't to say everyone will have the same results, but merely a warning for those who perfer watching DVDs on their computers.

3) The extras on disc 3 are utterly worthless. Some of the kids and monsters get a couple seconds worth of silent montages, while others get a screen full of text describing who they are and what they do. There's another section where you can view Lyoko through multiple fly-by's of the towers. Completely silent, really short, and while the menu's show nine towers, only 3-5 are actually viewable. I'm not sure if it's because the other's weren't shown during season one, or because I couln't get my remote to move over, but I found it gratuitously irritating.

4) Personally, I wish that the original French audio could be heard with English subtitles. English is the only audio available.

While I've listed more cons than pros, if you're a fan of Code Lyoko, this is definately a buy, despite the flaws. If you aren't, check out Cartoon Network 4:30E/3:30C to watch season 3.",1163030400,2,1929,4.536023054755043
