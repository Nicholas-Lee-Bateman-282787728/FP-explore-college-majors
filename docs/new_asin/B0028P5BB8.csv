8356572,5,B0028P5BB8,"This is a fun video to do with little ones. The only little problem we have is that it is for a Mom & one little one, so my three fight for turns... they love it though, and it is easy for all ages to follow the instructions.",1340064000,,225,3.7083333333333335
8356573,5,B0028P5BB8,"I bought this DVD after being given the Mommy & Baby yoga DVD at my baby shower. I loved the yoga DVD so much when my daughter was a baby, I thought that this would be the prefect step up now that she's toddling around. It's so fun!! Not only does she feel like a little ballerina, but we're having fun together, and getting a workout too. We both love it so much, that we now buy the set of three DVD's to include with our shower gifts, and everyone I've given them to has told me how much they love them. I'm definitely glad I received the yoga DVD, because now I've found the whole set, and my little one and I LOVE our time together with them.",1298592000,,647,4.023255813953488
