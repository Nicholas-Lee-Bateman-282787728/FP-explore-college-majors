8457206,4,B00551DYES,"If you are reading this you are probably a fan of the sport. I always see these shoot talks for sale and i always wonder about some of the viewers feedback were. So i want to give some notice on this one atleast. I am a fan of Bob B and T. Funk so i knew i would like this and it didn't let me down. The footage is clear and sharp but the major problem is that Backlund mumbles his way though the interview. I didn't know his voice was so raspy and low, you can barely understand or hear him. Terry comes through loud and clear, thank goodness. The topics are all pretty interesting, and the guys don't really wonder off on a tangent and for the most part stick to the questions from the interviewer. Check it out if you have some spare change and you like these two legends.",1364256000,,775,4.071895424836601
