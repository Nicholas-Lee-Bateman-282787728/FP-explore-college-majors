8223109,4,B000WFPYL8,"This is a true documentary on Bruce, concentrating on his early years.  Very informative and interesting as far as it goes (made in 2001)...and that's the problem.  We need some updated material and a lot more live concert footage with Cockburn solo and with his band. There HAS to be an audience for this. Let's hope something new is in the works, in the meantime buy this.",1273622400,,374,4.567164179104478

8223111,5,B000WFPYL8,"When I think of musicians who's music and lyrics have had the most profound affect on my life an inordinate number of them seem to come from our neighbor to the north. Maybe that's because I'm half Canadian, or maybe not. All I know is that whenever I'm in the mood for listening to something evocative and reflective such names come to mind as; Gordon Lightfoot, Loreena McKennitt and of course Bruce Cockburn.

While the first two above mentioned musicians have gained massive audiences in the U.S.A. and beyond, Cockburn has throughout his long career remained a lesser known artist outside the confines of the Canadian border. Maybe it's his bitting political commentary or his earlier highly spiritual leanings that have keep him from gaining a mass following, but alas this enigmatic, uncompromising Canadian native is an icon in his homeland.

'My Beat: The Life and Times of Bruce Cockburn' is a made-for-television film from '01 which is now available on DVD. For all you Cockburn fans out there this is an absolute must. Those unfamiliar with the artist or his body of work should also enjoy this bio-documentary. The production values are superior and the presentation informative and even-handed. Then of course there's the artist himself. Bruce is sensitive, introspective, articulate, honest and fiercely committed to his beliefs and his art. If you weren't familiar with his music before viewing this DVD you will more than likely find yourself purchasing an album or two after.

My Highest Recommendation! -5 Stars-.",1196467200,9,1532,5.095617529880478
8223112,5,B000WFPYL8,"This is a documentary produced for Canadian TV in 2001. It covers Bruce Cockburn's entire career from the late 60's to the present. I found it thoroughly enjoyable. There is footage of Bruce in concert (very short segments) throughout the years as well as his current commentary as we follow his career. My only complaint is that it runs about 50 minutes only. Bruce has been prolifically making music for 37 years and has released just about nothing as far as concert video (2 out-of-print VHS concerts and no official DVD's to be specific). Because of his relative obscurity in the 70's even hardcore collectors don't have anything before 1979. Bruce is amazing live, so this is puzzling to many of us. A multi-DVD retrospective of live Bruce throughout the years would be welcomed by fans. This documentary is a very nice appetizer.",1191888000,13,835,4.846153846153846
