8220803,5,B000W00XXW,This is a very funny show with a talented cast.  Apparently it was a bit  too controversial for CBC as it only lasted two seasons.  At least they went out at the top of their game.  It is Canadian but the rest of the world gets a bit of attention too that isn't what most politicians want aired.  Well worth watching.,1441756800,,317,4.131147540983607
