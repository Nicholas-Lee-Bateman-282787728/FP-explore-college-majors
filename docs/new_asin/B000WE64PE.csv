2967214,3,B000WE64PE,"I found this movie interesting but not too biblically accurate. A lot of the movie is set in Abraham's homeland before he leaves for the promised land. Abraham is a very gifted sculptor who begins to see that his sculptures which are worshiped as gods are just pieces of rock. This brings him in conflict with his mentor and also with Nimrod the king. He is ultimately burned at the stake but is miraculously rescued by the true God whom Abraham has begun to hear. None of this has anything to do with the biblical account of Abraham. The rest of the movie consists of Abraham and co. being led to the promised land and then loosely (very loosely?) follows the biblical story.
If you are looking for a spiritual movie with biblical themes and don't mind English subtitles then this one is not too bad. If you are looking for a biblically accurate depiction of the life of Abraham then look elsewhere.",1261440000,2,900,4.52760736196319

8222923,1,B000WE64PE,"Here is one opinion.
Iranian movies? Sometimes truly amazing.
Religious movies? Great.
I am aware that religious movies have a different standard. Most religious movies make ""made for tv seem like academy award classics."" Having said this, the production quality of this movie seems less than a feeble attempt of turning a poorly written stage play into a movie. I can't speak for the actors, but the acting, direction, and over all cinematography was so far below standard, to call it ""horrible"" or ""monstrous"" would be far too generous. I could not endure the entire movie, I can, therefore, not say if it got better, yet I am certain beyond doubt it did not. One other thing, this had an eerie feel like a ""warning"" from a theocratic government to remain faithful to a state religion--but that is just a ""feeling"" it gave me. Believe me, I have no problem with the Islamic faith and its faithful. Good luck.",1479513600,,910,4.729559748427673
8222924,1,B000WE64PE,Only watch for about 15 minutes. Lowes quality picture show I've ever watch. It doesn't worth a dime. But for the Biblical story I gave 1 star,1475452800,,142,4.296296296296297

8222926,1,B000WE64PE,Terrible....could not tell from description on firestick that it was subtitled....after reading re iews on my actual computer I know I never would have ordered it due to a variety of reasons. Too bad amazon did not give all the information in the description. It had a glowing description on the tv screen but failed miserably to live up to it.,1446076800,,344,4.655737704918033

8222928,1,B000WE64PE,"This is a deceptive title and movie.  This is not about Abraham, but a fictional character.  This is the muslim version of Abraham.  FYI",1398902400,6,136,4.583333333333333
8222929,1,B000WE64PE,"It was not indicated anywhere in the information about this video that it was produced in Iran, had subtitles, and was from an Islamic view point. After the opening credit red flags went up for me, the first scene was satan in the desert, speaking a foreign language with subtitles. I fast forwarded it to the end, and saw that the whole movie was subtitles, so I sent it back without viewing it!
I was hoping that this was a movie from a Jewish or Christian viewpoint, that had somehow, escaped my notice for the last four years. I had never seen it available before. I took a chance in renting this without doing an internet search on it. I regret wasting my time and money on it.",1369440000,6,682,4.3359375
8222930,2,B000WE64PE,Lacks modern sophisticated technology; poor acting and poor quality film production.  Not recommended for Biblical education or teaching of scripture.,1359158400,6,150,6.5
8222931,1,B000WE64PE,"This version of the original film has been edited and inaccurately translated to roughly fit the Christian viewpoint of the story of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him). In addition to editing out some of the original footage, which depicts the Quranic and Islamic version of the story, this version does not accurately translate in English what the actors are saying in Persian. For example, in the part where Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is ordered by God to sacrifice his son, the voice in Persian says 'Ismaeel' but the subtitles read 'Ishaaq'. Muslims believe that God ordered Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) to sacrifice his first son Prophet Ismaeel (peace be upon him) rather than Prophet Ishaaq (peace be upon him).

The original film is intended for a Muslim audience. Muslims don't have a problem with a difference in viewpoints between the Biblical and Quranic viewpoints of the story. Muslims have a high reverence for all the Biblical Prophets and believe in all the Books of God. With that said, however, stealing the original footage from Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), putting inaccurate subtitles in it which don't reflect the original Persian dialogues, and calling it a presentation by 'George David Jiha' and a 'Harvest Pictures' release is at least morally wrong, if not also illegal.

The original version of this film was recorded in Iran. The film was made for Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB)'s Channel 2. A major part of Prophet Ibrahim's life--including the important events--have been filmed at IRIB's Ghazzali Movie Town, while the scenes of the Holy Ka'ba (the symbolic House of God) have been filmed near the city of Karaj, west of Tehran (the scenes of the Ka'ba have been conveniently deleted in this version of the original film).

I purchased this DVD to show my children the Islamic version of the story of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) but I was very disappointed to learn that this Islamic version has been hijacked. I am writing this review to inform other Muslims that this is not the original Islamic version of this otherwise good film; so please don't waste your money on it. Unfortunately, the original version with accurate English subtitles is not sold on Amazon.",1341273600,3,2254,4.973474801061008
8222932,5,B000WE64PE,"I am not a fan of movies with translation, but I really liked the way they portrayed Abraham's story in this one.  I also liked the seriousness and sobriety that it was made with, it shows a great deal of respect, regardless of whether it is derived from Biblical or Koranic teaching - the message of the movie got across!!",1291852800,4,323,4.383333333333334
