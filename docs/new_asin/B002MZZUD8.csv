8374449,5,B002MZZUD8,"Roy Rogers - my family now has all the Roy Rogers videos, DVD, etc. It will be cherished for decades to come",1361923200,,108,3.9545454545454546
8374450,4,B002MZZUD8,"If you love Roy Rogers and Roy Rogers films this is one of the greatest. Lots of action, shooting and fighting and lots of humour. Mary Hart ( aka Lynne Roberts ) is wonderful, Frank Jaquet is a mean villain, and the else so distinguished Stanley Andrews is a scene stealing sloppy and funny bandit leader. The showdown fight with him and Rogers is fantastic. William Farnum has a touching and moving part wearing the outfit in which we so often have admired him: Black shirt, black trousers, cuffs and an old authentic hat. Lots of ""realibles"" among others Jack Rockwell, Loyd Ingraham, Jack Ingram and Jack Kirk. Why don't I give all five stars? Because the picture quality is acceptable and now and then a little more than acceptable but never quite sharp.",1359331200,,759,4.6716417910447765
8374451,1,B002MZZUD8,i was disappointrd it was not the dennis morgan-ann sheridan version.  maybe i didn't read clearly enough; i was disappointed just the same.,1331424000,,140,5.086956521739131
8374452,4,B002MZZUD8,"This is one of the good typical older Roy Rogers films.  I purchased this film after viewing  a Mill Creek print and found the
Sinister print to be better quality. Many of these public domain films are transfers from VHS prints and are not watchable on your medium to large flat screen TVs",1278892800,,289,4.433962264150943
