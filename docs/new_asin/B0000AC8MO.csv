THE MOVIE HAS SOME GOOD SWORDFIGHTS, BUT THE MOVIE'S ALSO TOO LONG, TOO SLOW MOVING AT TIMES, AND IT'S JUST A TRIAL TO SIT THROUGH AT TIMES!NOT TO MENTION, THE DUBBING IS HORRENDOUS. MARTIAL ARTS FANS SHOULD SKIP THIS ONE. THERE'S MUCH BETTER MOVIES OUT THERE THAN THIS.",1089590400,3,320,4.631578947368421
7996857,3,B0000AC8MO,"I first saw this film in the original Japanese as ""Satomi Hakenden."" I was not disappointed in the visuals but I couldn't help cringing at the awful American ""translation."" They got the basic idea right but the language they chose took a powerful coming of age story and made it sound ridiculous. If you can't get the original, get this just for the visuals and play it with the sound turned down.",1060646400,2,397,4.527777777777778
