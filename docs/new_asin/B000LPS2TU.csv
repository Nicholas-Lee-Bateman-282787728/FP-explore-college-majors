2712148,5,B000LPS2TU,"Bourdain is the best host out there.  This is the only travel show I watch because it is not typical.  He is witty, intelligent and funny.  He tries to connect to the people he is meeting not just show the most popular spots.

2712149,5,B000LPS2TU,"since we aren't blessed enough to get DVD releases of Gordon Ramsay over here in the States, at least we have local bad boy foody Tony Bourdain! i absolutely LOVE this guy! i could go on and on and gush like a giddy schoolgirl, but i won't ;)
what i will go on about is why they aren't releasing the COMPLETE SEASON!? i've contacted Image Entertainment, and no answer... so this really sucks! also, i wonder if we (in the U.S.) will get the uncensored EXTENDED Euro-versions? i'm already not going to buy this set because it's NOT complete, but if we don't get the extended versions, i'll be really annoyed, as i know for a fact there is extra footage shown in Europe that doesn't make it over here. i record the Travel Channel episodes to a set-top Digital Video Recorder (harddrive) and i have ALL seasons 1, 2 and now starting 3 burned to DVDR, so unless they are releasing EXTENDED VERSIONS, with COMMENTARIES, EXTRA INTERVIEWS, OUTTAKES, etc. i'm happy to just watch my DVDRs of the broadcast versions if there's nothing EXTRA for spending money.
anyway, let's hope there will be a EUROPEAN DVD release of the complete season 1.

oh, and whoever owns the rights to ""A Cook's Tour"" -- PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE release those Season sets!!!",1168214400,65,1238,4.601809954751131
2712160,4,B000LPS2TU,"This set represents the first several episodes in Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations series.  You can tell the series hadn't quite found its footing in the first few episodes.  The basic premise of the show is the same as it is now, but Mr. Bourdain was still basically doing his Cook's Tour, I'll eat any type of food no matter how weird like eating rotten shark meat in Iceland.  That's not to say the episodes aren't still great.  The New Jersey episode where he goes back to his home state is quite funny (especially the end scene with Mario Batalli in an homage to The Godfather) and the Vegas episode with Michael Ruhlman has a definite Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas/Hunter S. Thompson trippy kind of vibe.  The premier episode in Paris sets the tone for the series as Mr. Bourdain towards the end lays out a manifesto for what he is trying to accomplish.",1321488000,,860,4.52258064516129
2712161,4,B000LPS2TU,"I've enjoyed Bourdain's shtick since first catching him on the Food Network. The Cook's Tour was raw and unfiltered, a refreshing change from the other cooking shows on that network at the time. No Reservations carries on that tradition, but now on the Travel Channel.

This DVD set contains 4 disc with 2 episodes per disc. For this set, Bourdain got to visit his hometown of Jersey. Things get personal as he explores Jerseyite's complex with big-brother NY. In Paris, Bourdain ventures through a tombstone-cellar of skulls(and wine).

In Sicily, Bourdain gets to converse with an opinionated dwarf-like man who professes to know a lot about cinema(among other things). Las Vegas just plain ol' confuses Anthony as he see's a duplicate of NYC(along with Sammy Davis Jr). For New Zealand, Bourdain gives a lecture telling the crowd ""cooking is like pornography"".

In Malaysia, Bourdain does some slaughtering and is rewarded with a tattoo. During his Iceland trip, Anthony gets bullied by a bunch of horny muscle-heads eating some hearty soup. And finally, Vietnam. A place Bourdain describes as..""love at first sight"".

A couple of bones to pick. First off this isn't a full season set, would've been nice if it were. Also there are no special features; no behind-the-scenes commentary from Bourdain, too bad. Otherwise this is a terrific set showcasing Bourdain's quirky and entertaining persona(overly sensitive people need not apply).",1307404800,2,1439,5.216450216450217
2712162,4,B000LPS2TU,Tony needs to get back to Malaysia and head up to Penang.  That's the food capital of the country.  Despite skipping the Pearl of the Orient it was all-in-all an entertaining show and one of his better ones.  I think he captured the essence of Malaysia very well.  And his head hunter friend really added to the show.,1303171200,,317,4.413793103448276

When I have gatherings, which are usually food-centered, sometimes my friends would ask for me to play one.  Also, one of my friends happen to be traveling to three places that there were episodes for, so I offered to lend them to her to watch prior to her trip.  Because they're short, compared to a movie, it's less of a commitment when you just have 30-40 minutes to kill.  Some episodes are better than others.",1264982400,,538,4.5625

2712166,5,B000LPS2TU,"The Japan episode was the first one I saw on television while travelling on business. I could not remeber the name of the show at the time, and spent several hours searching the net before I found the info including broadcast schedule and DVD's for sale.

We went of a 3 week trip to Japan in April 2009 and spent a couple of days in Osaka with some Japanese friends. Sadly, the Kuidaore restaurant had closed and the clown was gone, but we did get our picture taken in front of kanidoraku! We had to make our own version of kuidaore (you have to see the episode to understand unless you speak Japanese) with a friend who owned a bar. I, like Tony vowed to never EVER do karioke, but after several hours of self indulgent kuidaore, found the microphone in hand and delivered a rousing rendition of the Star Spangled Banner that brought the house down.

I love Tony's style and the locations for the shoots. Being of asian background, I really enjoy seeing all the asian episodes and share Tony's affinity for the culture and of course the food!!

I recommend this and any of Tony's DVD's if you are a lover of life, people, and great food!",1251244800,,1139,4.414285714285715
2712167,4,B000LPS2TU,"The first time I sat and watched No Reservations with Tony Bourdain, it was because I'd stumbled upon the Paris episode while channel surfing one bored summer afternoon.  Paris has long been a dream destination of mine, so I checked it out. From the get-go, my expectations were challenged and my interest piqued. The Eiffel Tower? Notre Dame? The Louvre?  Not on this show. How about an absinthe bar followed by a hallucinogenic night back in the same hotel room where Oscar Wilde died instead? Or a visit to a wine cellar that leads to an eerie stumble through catacombs and sewers? Or the central market where we see a decapitated reindeer and hear our narrator apologize to children awaiting Christmas presents because ""Santa cut Rudolph's f-ing head off?"" I quickly realized that this wasn't some tired, formulaic, and superficial travelogue or some half-baked Fear Factor retread with the host trying to make the viewer squirm. This was intellectual and thoughtful, spiced with Bourdain's jaded attitude, searing sarcasm and caustic sense of humor. Furthermore, I liked that he sought out the understated, sublime, local favorites instead of the popular tourist stops and that he preferred the seedy and debauched over the posh and staid. This was a guy who was visiting Paris like I would like to do. This was an anti-tourist show hosted by an anti-hero. I was immediately a fan.
This dvd collection features eight episodes and, as many have already noted, it is an incomplete collection. According to Amazon's offerings, there are 13 episodes in the first season available for individual purchase, so why there are only eight here is hard to fathom. It seems likely that a more comprehensive and accurate compilation will eventually come around, so keep this in mind when contemplating purchasing this set. Also, these are edited with profanities (and there are many) bleeped out and there are no frills at all. It is episodes only, no commentary, behind the scenes, interviews, or anything. Again this leads me to think that a better release might be in order with Bourdain's predictably derisive commentary, the missing scenes available on the channel's website, and perhaps some other goodies. He has already amended his books, so it seems possible that the dvds will get a new look as well. The show and the fans deserve it. My four star rating is based on the content, however, and not the problems outside of the material contained herein. Whether you wish to spend twenty bucks on an incomplete collection that is badly in need of an upgrade is up to you. It is the nature of entertainment corporations to re-release popular items to force serious fans to re-purchase something that should have been done right the first time. Greed...don't ya love it?
The best episodes? A visit to his roots in New Jersey that demonstrates things aren't nearly so bad here in the states if you apply the same open-mind and tolerance to your countrymen that you do to your foreign country hosts, the aforementioned ""French Don't Suck"" visit to Paris, the humbling and life-threatening journey to New Zealand, his James Bond inspired trip to North Vietnam, and the harrowing yet introspective excursion to Malaysia.
The lesser ones are the Sicily, Iceland, and Las Vegas installments. Sicily was hokey and out of character. It felt forced, insincere, and uninspired. Iceland is like the Sweden episode from a future season; there is little of interest outside of Viking references, cold temperatures, and questionable food. He doesn't carry himself with passion in these spots as he does in those locales where his soul seems enriched by the experience. For Las Vegas, he tries hard to bring in a Fear and Loathing vibe, but let's face it; every other show on The Travel Network or The Food Channel seems to take place in that city and I'm just sick of Las Vegas already. Las Vegas is nothing if not THE most overrated city in the country, if not the world, and one more person's take on Adult Disneyland is one less I need to see. If only what happened in Vegas truly stayed there, I wouldn't be subjected to it every time I turned on the boob tube. That personal gripe aside, even the three sub-par ones are still worth viewing just to see these places and watch Bourdain struggle at times to find humor in the occasional ridiculousness of travel television.
Season one is a good beginning to what has become regular tv viewing for me. This is smart, engrossing, and fun television. Now if they can just get the true and complete collection together...",1248912000,11,4552,4.872258064516129
2712168,4,B000LPS2TU,"I've been a pretty big fan of Bourdain's food-centric travelogues since Food Network debuted the A Cook's Tour show and the accompanying book (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Cook-s-Tour-Global-Adventures-in-Extreme-Cuisines/dp/0060012781/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Cook's Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines</a>).  From his auto-bio/expose on the restaurant business&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Ed-Adventures-in-the-Culinary-Underbelly-P-S/dp/0060899220/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kitchen Confidential Updated Ed: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (P.S.)</a>, to his unrestricted palette of taste, through to his no nonsense style of writing food inspired crime fiction, Bourdain has cut an interesting niche in the foodie world.  With No Reservations, he's left behind the insanity of the Food Network and taken his travels in search of good food and culture to the Travel Channel.

What I find interesting about this new show is the balance he's seemingly struck between his own tendencies and the requirements of filming a network driven travel show.  On A Cook's tour it came across as butting heads with the network and producers resulting in a lackluster second season filled with excursions to ridiculous destinations like the Mall of America, content that felt forced and sad.  No Reservations, though occasionally still succumbing to these depths (Iceland anyone?), frees Bourdain up to getting to the heart of the matter which is examining true local culture and the food that sustains and elevates it.  It combines the point of view of a 70s punk rebel with a soul searching existentialist, while also ditching most of the pretension and being generally entertaining TV which is pretty darn rare.

If you're looking for the insanity of A Cook's Tour (the swallowing of still beating cobra hearts, etc.) than you might be a bit disappointed, but if the first thought when entering a new city or country is locating a good genuine meal that speaks to the local culture than this is the show for you.  It's not a how-to for finding the tourist traps of the world, but a how to avoid these and eat like a local.  This is probably the weakest collection, though there are some gems like Anthony's trips to Vietnam, New Jersey and Malaysia.

There are currently 3 other seasons available:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anthony-Bourdain-No-Reservations-Collection-2/dp/B000XXWDZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anthony Bourdain - No Reservations Collection 2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anthony-Bourdain-No-Reservations-Collection-3/dp/B001HB1K1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations - Collection 3</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anthony-Bourdain-No-Reservations-Collection-Four/dp/B0026IQTPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations - Collection Four</a>.",1246838400,2,3075,7.13262599469496
2712169,1,B000LPS2TU,"My husband and I were truly disappointed. We fast forwarded certain sections.

If you must watch Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, please borrow it at the library. We only watched DVD 1 on Paris and it was boring. We waited for him to give us some inside scoop on good authentic places to eat but only saw one bistro. He spent like 15 minutes talking and reexplaining a drink called Absente that can turn your stomach all green. He meets this American in a bar who explains the drink in detail to him, and then takes him to this personal bar where he has more Absente. I was bored to death!

Anthony did a big promo of his Hotel called Hotel in St-Germain des pres (we saw the big fancy room and the pool). No mention on other good hotels to stay and which neighborhoods we should visit.

We saw a big meat market where the butchers all meet very early in the morning. His jokes were not funny at all, we would see Anthony walking down the street lighting up a cigarette. The only good part was towards the end where he took us to a bakery (boulangerie) and you see the chef making baguette and croissants very early in the morning.

What I wanted to know is: how do I choose a good bistro, what is must to eat in Paris (besides the boudin).

Again, please do not waste your money to purchase this DVD. Borrow it from the library. A real disappointment.

I loved his bio though.",1240963200,,1380,4.308880308880309
2712170,4,B000LPS2TU,"Anthony Bourdain is an entertaining writer and personality. I like his TV shows for his candor and ascerbic wit. His show is purely about his adventures and travels in search of good food and meeting some pretty cool people along the way. Overall, I like this collection even though it isn't the complete first season. Sometimes his whining about what a miserable job he has gets my nerves (Seriously! This guy gets paid to travel, eat and enjoy life! How can he complain???), but the overall entertainment value outweighs the irritation factor, so I still watch it. I took away one star from the rating just because he gets annoying at times and also due to the fact that this collection doesn't include the whole season.",1238025600,,722,4.738095238095238

Also, it's a mystery to me why the Uzbekistan episode (Season one, episode 8) was not included in the collection, and an annoyance that it needs to be purchased separately as an individual DVD if you want all of the season one episodes.  Other than the DVD product annoyances, Anthony Bourdain and No Reservations are great, and I'm happy to have this in my collection.",1237420800,,508,4.538461538461538

2712176,5,B000LPS2TU,"I have read Anthony's books first. Then I saw one of his TV shows ""by accident"" while switching through the channels. I wanted more. So I rent all DVDs during my last vacation in the US and watched them in a row.

Now, one year later, I wanted to see some of his shows again as I am interested in visiting some of the places he went, and as I am also a hunter for good local food and specialites, I decided to buy all his DVDs here on Amazon. And I have soooo much fun with them.

You see other views of a country, not the typical tourist paths. Food you wouldn't dare to touch or put it in your mouth - he does it for us. Great guy. Can't wait to go to Sicily and try that strange fried meat-parts hidden under a towel from these old men on the streets, too. Or the melon gelly with pistachios and dark chocolate bits.... Yummie!

These are short movies you can watch several times. They are fun, interesting, educational and like a nice trip to a foreign world in times you get ""itchy feet"" and wanna do at least some couchvacation....

Buy all at once, because you will like the first, and then you regret you have to pay extra postal service for the others.... ;-)

Have fun

2712177,5,B000LPS2TU,"Having watched No Reservations for a long time and traveled to many areas, I think Tony Bourdain is the best travel host on TV. He is real!!
No tourist garbage, real people and a look at what really exists.
He has the ability to laugh at himself and those people that hate him. I like the fact that he cusses, he drinks and will try almost anything. He also is not afraid to show genuine feeling when the situation is appropiate.
I purchased two volumes of his programs and will purchase the third in a few days when it becomes available.
I especially like his take on going bamboo! I have done that and will return soon to that life. Damn, he had that right!

This first collection/season on DVD is fantastic but the thing that really ""bites"" (pun intended) is that the Uzbekistan episode is missing.  Hence this is a ""collection"" of No Reservation instead of a ""season"".  Was something so objectionable to that episode that it cannot be included in that set?!  Everyone buys DVDs for extras and you would expect, well- extras.  In this case, there are no extras.  I would hope there would be out-takes, deleted scenes, additional commentary or behind the scenes but that is not the case.  One feature that would be VERY nice would be the uncensored audio track in addition to the censored ""bleeped"" audio track that you could select as an alternative.  Who wouldn't want to hear what Tony was REALLY thinking?  :)

If you really like the series and don't already have a DVD-R, Tivo or digital copy, this is the best alternative.  The production is first rate on this DVD series and the case design is outstanding.  It's too funny that the Discovery Channel store doesn't carry this series at all.

2712183,4,B000LPS2TU,"I have watched ""No Reservations"" since it premiered on the Travel Channel. I have also read all of Bourdain's nonfiction books, and I recommend both this series and his books to anyone serious about different cultures and the foods they eat.

It is no surprise, then, that overall I give the material on this DVD set five stars, but have to take away a star for a couple of reasons. The first and most obvious problem with this set is that it isn't complete, as has been noted by others. It would certainly have been better (even if it was somewhat pricier) if it was complete; likewise some extras (outtakes, commentary, etc.) would have been a welcome, though not strictly necessary, addition. I do have a cautionary tale about my set specifically: mine came without the Iceland and Vietnam DVD, which happen to be, in my opinion, the best two shows of the series. In its place I got an additional copy of the Sicily and Las Vegas DVD, which is the weakest of the four discs in my opinion. Fortunately I had bought the Vietnam and Iceland episodes as separate (and much more expensive) single show DVD's, but it is an annoyance nonetheless.

Without question this is my favorite travel show. I think Bourdain better than other hosts goes out of his way to unearth the fundamental nature of the places he visits (most notably in the excellent Malaysia episode) and truly values and respects the people he meets, despite his acerbic and sarcastic nature. While there are views where we differ, I know that Tony Bourdain and the ""No Reservations"" staff are fundamentally straight shooters who excel off the beaten path of cuisine and culture. While there are things I would obviously change about this set, it is an excellent value, and any reservations I have are in no way related to the actual content of these four DVD's.

I truly recommend this set with no reservations.",1182470400,35,1874,4.689969604863222

8163278,4,B000LPS2TU,"I never really watched the Travel Channel until I discovered Anthony Bourdain on CNN. Now I DVR everything Bourdain that I can. I really like the No Reservations series because of Anthony's colorful language that has been reigned-in a bit on CNN. Since there are 9 seasons of No Reservations, it will take me forever to see them all on cable, So I will like be buying seasons 2 - 9.

My only complaint with this package, is that it was used and marked ""Denver Public Library"".",1414540800,,476,4.471264367816092
8163279,2,B000LPS2TU,Quite vulgar.  Can't show it to my students in a school culinary setting.  I don't feel crude language is necessary to get ones point across.,1394582400,,141,4.6
8163280,5,B000LPS2TU,"I don't care that much about food, but I read Kitchen Confidential and was drawn to Anthony's quick wit and take on a variety of subjects, plus -- his super quirky didain for falsehoods.  I laugh when they have to bleep him. Also he's attractive. I do greatly enjoy his devotion to the 'regular"" people of every country and state, not the upscale life. A treat to watch.",1377561600,,370,4.4411764705882355

8163282,3,B000LPS2TU,"ORIGINAL REVIEW: (additional EDIT to follow)
I love a good show about food and/or travel.  Gordon Ramsey's shows are probably at the top of my list (except for Hell's Kitchen which is just an Americanization of his no-holds-barred attitude--track down the early Kitchen Nightmares from Britain for a real treat), and I've watched countless others.  To enjoy a show like this, one must have some sort of affinity for the star of the show.  I do not enjoy Anthony Bourdain's personality AT ALL.  He sucks the life out everything that could be interesting in his show.  Granted, I was only able to make it through 1.5 episodes, so maybe it gets better.  I won't be watching any more to find out.  Luckily, I watched said 1.5 episodes (Paris and half of Iceland) on Netflix, so I didn't waste any money buying these DVDs.  If you like an overly-critical, sarcastic, and just all-around nasty approach to travel and food-related information, give this DVD a try.  If this review makes you wary, maybe you can see a bit of him on Youtube first before spending your hard-earned money.

EDIT: (from 1-star to 3-star review)
I watched some more and enjoyed it more than I first did.  Still not a big fan of Anthony Bourdain's personality, however.  Didn't make it all the way through this collection.  I may watch more in the future if I find myself out of things to watch.  Learned some interesting things about Sicily and the other places he visits.  I enjoy learning new stuff, so who knows what the future holds for Mr. Bourdain and me.",1344384000,,1531,4.66044776119403
8163283,5,B000LPS2TU,"How am I the only reviewer for the first episode of No Reservations? Tone' is the man. He and the Zero Point Zero crew deserve a major shout out for taking the travel and eat format in such a strange and wonderful direction. Yeah, the food porn is great, and the show inspires major wanderlust. But what really sets it apart is Tony's insightful narration and the film crew's resourceful cinematography. One of the few series out there that has passed the 10 season mark and continues to mature.",1331078400,,495,4.573033707865169
