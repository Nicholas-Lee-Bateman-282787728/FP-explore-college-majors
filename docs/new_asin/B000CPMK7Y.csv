8100156,5,B000CPMK7Y,"Great introduction to art, history, sicence, Catholic history, morals.  It takes a fictional story (unsure if this is based on real life because it deals with L da Vinci adopting a young orphan boy and mentoring him and teaching him values).  Even if fictional, it is a good catalyst for a moral discussion....even in public school.  The animation is very good...I believe the animaters were trained under Disney.  The art of Ld V. is presented and is beautifully depicted to the point that my class of African American kids gasped.  They also were excited about the inventions of entrepreneurs.  I find African American kids really value well-made art.  Many of them are drawn to entrepreneurial thinking so they loved the inventions part.

As far as Catholic History, this is good to show that the arts in the west were mobilized----mostly by the Catholic Church after the fall of the Roman empire....as it was because the Christian (Catholic) Roman Empire...Popes were as powerful as kings and had access to great amounts of money...They used it wisely in creating some of the greatest works known in the world...It financed Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, and all the greatest sculptors and painters of modern history (also, the most beautiful illuminated bibles). No art is as beautiful and striking as the art work of this time period.",1385337600,,1342,5.040723981900452
