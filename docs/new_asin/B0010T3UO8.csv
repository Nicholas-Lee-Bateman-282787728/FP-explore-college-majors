3049964,5,B0010T3UO8,"I picked up the original BCI release of this series several years ago. I understand that Mill Creek re-released this when BCI went belly up. Can't comment on that set, just the series in general. If you like Japanese superheroes, Power Rangers, Godzilla, Gamera, old school TV like Space Giants, Ultraman and Johnny Sokko/Giant Robot then you should LOVE this show. Filmed in 1973, this show is extremely low-tech, sorta silly, but most important, all kinds of fun. Just keep in mind when it was made. If you DON'T go in expecting ILM-level effects or cutting edge CGI you'll be alright. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THE SHOW IS IN JAPANESE W/ ENGLISH SUBTITLES. THERE IS NO DUBBING. YOU HAVE TO ""READ"" THIS SHOW. Got that? Alright? Okay, let's move on.

THE STORY: Towards the end of the 20th century, an evil organization calling itself The Iron Alliance infiltrates the World Robot Expo in Tokyo and steals all of the robots brought there from various nations around the world. Only Red Baron, built by scientific genius Kenichiro Kurenai but not brought to the expo, remains. When Kurenai is killed for refusing to join The Iron Alliance his younger brother, Ken, is left to pilot the massive robot into battle against the other now-renegade automatons whose powers are now turned against us by the ruthless Iron Alliance and its fiendish leader, Professor Devilier, in a bid to destroy the Earth. To stop them Ken joins the SSI (Secret Science Investigators) and also receives help from the well-meaning but clumsy Inspector Kumano. Together, they must defend Japan and the Earth. (Just think PACIFIC RIM done on a high school Christmas Pageant-level budget.)

RED BARON is a real blast and has a raw energy to it. The plots are self-contained for the first 22 or so episodes but as the second phase of the show gets underway it shifts to a more semi-connected, soap opera style and actually gets better as it goes along. The bad guys are just plain evil and there are always a wave of cannon fodder fighters for the S.S.I. team members to mix it up with before Ken & Red Baron engage in the main robot showdown. I especially enjoy the minions used in the 2nd half of the series: The SpaceFrankenstein CrossingGuard Fencing Squad. LOL. The human fight scenes are frantically paced and the robot battles, while stagy to a certain degree, are very cool nonetheless. Red Baron has a pretty impressive array of weapons and continues to get upgrades as the series progresses. His design is kinda plain and a little on the skinny side but thankfully he has plenty of firepower to back him up. Watching these DVDs on a large screen with a Blu-ray player makes the imperfections of the source material very obvious, unfortunately. There's some fairly heavy pixelation & artifacting at times. The focus is kinda soft and the colors have some fading & bleeding, but the show was shot, I believe, on 16mm film originally, so that is to be expected. The sound mix is solid, and in glorious mono. The subtitles are easy to follow on the BCI release. I have heard bad things about the Mill Creek port but haven't seen it, so I cannot say.

I really like RED BARON. It's too bad that BCI, the company who originally worked to get these shows released over here, went belly up before they could give us any others. BCI reportedly had a third Japanese series (SILVER KNIGHT) subtitled and ready for distribution when they went suddenly out of business. Now that so many years have passed, the rights to it have likely reverted back to the show's original owners and it's highly unlikely that SILVER MASK will ever see the light of day here in the U.S. I had hoped that the RED BARON sequel series, called MACH BARON, might have eventually been released here, too. With continually-dwindling DVD/Blu-ray sales and the shrinking market for physical media, I doubt much of any of the dozens of other tokusatsu (SPFX) action shows will ever make it here stateside. There are some outfits subtitling them for direct streaming, but having collections such as this on DVD seem to be getting less likely to happen with each passing day, unfortunately. Still, at least we do have superfun shows like this one and IRON KING, plus the uniformly excellent releases from JPN (KIKAIDA, KIKAIDA 01, KAMEN RIDER V3 and INAZUMAN), Shout! Factory's offerings of ULTRASEVEN and ULTRA Q, plus the classic ULTRAMAN and JOHNNY SOKKO/GIANT ROBOT (which were dubbed in English, as well as subtitled) to keep us happy.  In summary... 5 STARS for the unique, old school robo fun that is SUPER ROBOT: RED BARON.",1422835200,,4564,4.758838383838384

This show, of which I knew nothing about before hand, is just pure fun. Obviously it's cheesy, yes, so it's not for everyone. It's also one of the more endearing shows of its kind that I've come across. Everyone looks like they're having a ton of fun but are simultaneously taking it very seriously. There are some really sweet visuals and creative effects at times, too.

Some humor and fun fight scenes which remind you of the old Godzilla movies. I would recommend seeing this. It is only in Japanese with English Subtitles. Enjoy...,1375228800,,448,4.475609756097561

For me what makes this Super Red Baron show so fun to watch are all the giant robots Red Baron fights. Some of which look like the Robots right out of the Gigantor cartoon brought to life. Some reviewers have made it a point to really gripe about an out-of-sync issue. Well since I don't speak Japanese I can't tell. I see their mouths move. I hear their voice. I see words on the screen. They stop talking. The words disappear. That looks pretty synced up to me. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the corny 70s style sitcom background music that pops up from time to time. But over all if you like seeing giant robots fight then you'll probably love this. In fact the more I watch this the more I hate the 2005 Tetsujin 28 Go movie for using CGI instead of suit actors.",1366416000,2,931,4.235955056179775

3049982,4,B0010T3UO8,"Should you be looking for film art- this isn't it.  But if your a fan of the early Japanese ""Secial Effects"" shows that really started with Ultraman then this value-priced pack is a great buy.  Packing is well done and each of the 4 disks has it's own sleeve in the box.  But realise that this series was made on what looked like Ultraman's lunch budget, and that is where the fun really begins.  Supposedly made by people ""responsable for Ultraman & Iron King (another gem)"" it has the same basic ""evil monster of the week"" set-up, only this time with some of the silliest robots ever to be seen, which includes the title robot - actually a mecha with a pilot, and others including one that plays a mean game of golf.

The transfer cold have been better, but in a way it ads to the feeling of just how old this series is.  While I couldn't find anything that said when Red Baron was produced, my guess from the hair, what they wore, and some of their vehicles, my guess puts it at the early to mid '70s so being just a bit grainy adds to it's charm to me.  I also strongly recommend that if you buy Red Baron then just save the time and get ""Iron King"" at the same time - it's sort of like RB's big brother from the same source and many of the same ""qualities"".  Between the two you will not only have some great entertainment but also a great value.

It is superior to the Johnny Sokko and His Giant Robot series.  I am amused and very entertained as a tokusatsu fan.  You won't regret this purchase.",1283212800,2,327,4.225806451612903
3049986,1,B0010T3UO8,"I own both the BCI version and Mill Creek version of the Super Robot Red Baron DVD's. If you can find a copy of the BCI release I would highly recommend getting that version over the Mill Creek release. BCI is now out of business so those discs are harder to find. My reason is that the Mill Creek version is a very shoddy cheap re-release of the BCI version. The episodes are crammed onto 4 DVD's rather than the 6 dvd's in the BCI version. Normally this would not be a big deal only meaning higher compression artifacts and lower image quality however somewhere in the process Mill Creek screwed up the subtitles so that as you are watching the show they start to go out of sync with the voices. It eventually gets to the point where subtitles are appearing on the screen when there is no voice to go along with it. It's very annoying and makes watching the episodes much more difficult as you don't always know which subtitle goes with which speaker. From the price it's obvious Mill Creek's are a budget release but in my opinion it's worth the effort to find the original BCI release even if it costs a little more.

Well, it's a Japanese tokusatsu(special effects) TV series that doesn't take itself too seriously yet is serious enough that, even the hardcore Kaiju fan, would love it. The series, itself, aired from April 4, 1973, to March 27, 1974, with a total of 39 episodes. The series was produced by the same team that brought you Ultraman and Iron King. It's story was later retold in the anime of Red Baron and the sequel Super Robot Mach Baron. It is set in the early 21st century. The Iron Alliance begins stealing giant robots built from all over the world as well as kidnapping their creators. Kurenai Kenichiro who creates Red Baron turns over his robot to his brother Ken. Ken is a member of SSI (Secret Science Investigation). Ken uses Red Baron to help them put a stop to the Iron Alliance from taking over the world. That's pretty much what the show is about.

The series is completely in Japanese with subtitles. While it is fine with me, it will probably upset some of you. Really, you shouldn't let that stop you from watching such an awesome show.

3049990,4,B0010T3UO8,"Super Robot Red Baron is an immensely entertaining item of televisual sci-fi culture from 1970s Japan. A group of young people work for a super-science organization that battles a crime syndicate / evil empire from space. Central to every episode is a climactic battle between the good-guy giant robot, Red Baron, and the equally enormous bad-guy robot-of-the-week. They fight it out, Godzilla-style, in an H-O scale landscape complete with model cities, refineries, factories, and little toy tanks that actually shoot. Generally speaking, the production values compare well to some shows from the same era, for example, Doctor Who of the 70s. There is a certain amount of the quirky-seeming (to western eyes) comic relief that is often present in Japanese productions. And while character development is limited, it is not altogether absent, and there are also moments of genuine drama and pathos. Most importantly, there are occasional flashes of visual brilliance. For example, in the series finale there are scenes of a surreal virtual reality beach and a clockwork throne room that would be at home in an episode of The Prisoner or in one of Andrei Tarkovsky's science fiction films.",1268006400,20,1188,5.225130890052356

With continually-dwindling DVD/Blu-ray sales and the shrinking market for physical media, I doubt much of any of the dozens of other tokusatsu (SPFX) action shows will ever make it here stateside. There are some outfits subtitling them for direct streaming, but having collections such as this on DVD seem to be getting less likely to happen with each passing day, unfortunately. Still, at least we do have superfun shows like this one and IRON KING, plus the uniformly excellent releases from JPN (KIKAIDA, KIKAIDA 01, KAMEN RIDER V3 and INAZUMAN), Shout! Factory's offerings of ULTRASEVEN and ULTRA Q, plus the classic ULTRAMAN and JOHNNY SOKKO/GIANT ROBOT (which were dubbed in English, as well as subtitled) to keep us happy.  In summary... 5 STARS for the unique, old school robo fun that is SUPER ROBOT: RED BARON.",1422835200,,4564,4.758838383838384

If you live tokusatsu then you'll love this series. If you're an ultimate purist then by all means drop over $50 for the six disc version that's becoming very difficult to find. This does just fine, don't listen to the other whiny reviews!",1393804800,3,366,4.397058823529412
3284471,5,B0010T3UO8,"A friend of mine recommended I check this out since I was looking for some more light robot fun after seeing Pacific Rim. He couldn't have picked something better.

This show, of which I knew nothing about before hand, is just pure fun. Obviously it's cheesy, yes, so it's not for everyone. It's also one of the more endearing shows of its kind that I've come across. Everyone looks like they're having a ton of fun but are simultaneously taking it very seriously. There are some really sweet visuals and creative effects at times, too. If you're looking for some light fun or comfort food television then give this a shot, you just might fall in love with it too.",1391040000,,664,4.533333333333333
3284472,4,B0010T3UO8,This is a fun series. It is reminiscent of Ultraman and ran for 39 episodes. It had a follow up series Super Robot Mach Baron which ran for 26 episodes. Basically an evil organization steals all the robots from a convention for giant robots and try to use them to take over the world. Some humor and fun fight scenes which remind you of the old Godzilla movies. I would recommend seeing this. It is only in Japanese with English Subtitles. Enjoy...,1375228800,,448,4.475609756097561

3284474,5,B0010T3UO8,"Yes there once was a short lived live action Tetsujin 28 Go/ Gigantor series way back like in 1960, but finding any footage or photos is next to impossible. For me what makes this Super Red Baron show so fun to watch are all the giant robots Red Baron fights. Some of which look like the Robots right out of the Gigantor cartoon brought to life. Some reviewers have made it a point to really gripe about an out-of-sync issue. Well since I don't speak Japanese I can't tell. I see their mouths move. I hear their voice. I see words on the screen. They stop talking. The words disappear. That looks pretty synced up to me. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the corny 70s style sitcom background music that pops up from time to time. But over all if you like seeing giant robots fight then you'll probably love this. In fact the more I watch this the more I hate the 2005 Tetsujin 28 Go movie for using CGI instead of suit actors.",1366416000,2,931,4.235955056179775

I am Japanese and I do not need to see the sub. cap. however I could not off it even DVD player ( SONY, Pioneer ) toggles it off... still appeared it ...
Then Uses GOM player ( Ubuntu 10.4 LTE ) then I could manage to display it off .... ( but not with WMP, DVD player on Mac... )

3284479,4,B0010T3UO8,"Should you be looking for film art- this isn't it.  But if your a fan of the early Japanese ""Secial Effects"" shows that really started with Ultraman then this value-priced pack is a great buy.  Packing is well done and each of the 4 disks has it's own sleeve in the box.  But realise that this series was made on what looked like Ultraman's lunch budget, and that is where the fun really begins.  Supposedly made by people ""responsable for Ultraman & Iron King (another gem)"" it has the same basic ""evil monster of the week"" set-up, only this time with some of the silliest robots ever to be seen, which includes the title robot - actually a mecha with a pilot, and others including one that plays a mean game of golf.

The transfer cold have been better, but in a way it ads to the feeling of just how old this series is.  While I couldn't find anything that said when Red Baron was produced, my guess from the hair, what they wore, and some of their vehicles, my guess puts it at the early to mid '70s so being just a bit grainy adds to it's charm to me.  I also strongly recommend that if you buy Red Baron then just save the time and get ""Iron King"" at the same time - it's sort of like RB's big brother from the same source and many of the same ""qualities"".  Between the two you will not only have some great entertainment but also a great value.

Now if only Johny Sako was in the same price range...",1308700800,4,1406,4.177777777777778

It is superior to the Johnny Sokko and His Giant Robot series.  I am amused and very entertained as a tokusatsu fan.  You won't regret this purchase.",1283212800,2,327,4.225806451612903
3284483,1,B0010T3UO8,"I own both the BCI version and Mill Creek version of the Super Robot Red Baron DVD's. If you can find a copy of the BCI release I would highly recommend getting that version over the Mill Creek release. BCI is now out of business so those discs are harder to find. My reason is that the Mill Creek version is a very shoddy cheap re-release of the BCI version. The episodes are crammed onto 4 DVD's rather than the 6 dvd's in the BCI version. Normally this would not be a big deal only meaning higher compression artifacts and lower image quality however somewhere in the process Mill Creek screwed up the subtitles so that as you are watching the show they start to go out of sync with the voices. It eventually gets to the point where subtitles are appearing on the screen when there is no voice to go along with it. It's very annoying and makes watching the episodes much more difficult as you don't always know which subtitle goes with which speaker. From the price it's obvious Mill Creek's are a budget release but in my opinion it's worth the effort to find the original BCI release even if it costs a little more.

3284485,5,B0010T3UO8,"If I had to pick a Kaiju(or Daikaiju, which means Giant Monster in Japanese) TV Show that is my favorite, I think Super Robot Red Baron would have to be my pick. Why? Well, it's a Japanese tokusatsu(special effects) TV series that doesn't take itself too seriously yet is serious enough that, even the hardcore Kaiju fan, would love it. The series, itself, aired from April 4, 1973, to March 27, 1974, with a total of 39 episodes. The series was produced by the same team that brought you Ultraman and Iron King. It's story was later retold in the anime of Red Baron and the sequel Super Robot Mach Baron. It is set in the early 21st century. The Iron Alliance begins stealing giant robots built from all over the world as well as kidnapping their creators. Kurenai Kenichiro who creates Red Baron turns over his robot to his brother Ken. Ken is a member of SSI (Secret Science Investigation). Ken uses Red Baron to help them put a stop to the Iron Alliance from taking over the world. That's pretty much what the show is about.

The series is completely in Japanese with subtitles. While it is fine with me, it will probably upset some of you. Really, you shouldn't let that stop you from watching such an awesome show. It'll give you a better understanding of Japanese TV shows such as this.",1275091200,14,1293,4.502127659574468

3284487,4,B0010T3UO8,"Super Robot Red Baron is an immensely entertaining item of televisual sci-fi culture from 1970s Japan. A group of young people work for a super-science organization that battles a crime syndicate / evil empire from space. Central to every episode is a climactic battle between the good-guy giant robot, Red Baron, and the equally enormous bad-guy robot-of-the-week. They fight it out, Godzilla-style, in an H-O scale landscape complete with model cities, refineries, factories, and little toy tanks that actually shoot. Generally speaking, the production values compare well to some shows from the same era, for example, Doctor Who of the 70s. There is a certain amount of the quirky-seeming (to western eyes) comic relief that is often present in Japanese productions. And while character development is limited, it is not altogether absent, and there are also moments of genuine drama and pathos. Most importantly, there are occasional flashes of visual brilliance. For example, in the series finale there are scenes of a surreal virtual reality beach and a clockwork throne room that would be at home in an episode of The Prisoner or in one of Andrei Tarkovsky's science fiction films.",1268006400,20,1188,5.225130890052356
