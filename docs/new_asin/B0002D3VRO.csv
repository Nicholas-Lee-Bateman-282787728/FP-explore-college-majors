2713935,2,B0002D3VRO,"Pretty clunky noir. Seems like a made-for-tv mystery, long breaks for commercials. Redeeming virtue: a twist. A waste of Richard Kiley, the Man of La Mancha.",1398729600,,157,5.076923076923077
2713936,5,B0002D3VRO,"A man named Frank Manning (Richard Kiley) goes to his doctor named Ron Wellesley (John Forsythe) for a simple procedure.

Now, he instructs Ron to leave town or he'll blab. Luckily for Ron, one of his patients is a heroin addict, and he uses him to carry out his master plan of vengeance and death! Meanwhile, a mutual acquaintance, who happens to be a cop (Joseph Campanella), snoops around for clues. MURDER ONCE REMOVED is a great made-for-TV movie from 1971 w/ a perfect twist ending!

SYNOPSIS--
John Forsythe is a family doctor who's having an affair with Barbara Bain, wife of wealthy Richard Kiley. With the husband's suspicions of her infidelity confirmed by a private investigator, he brings the matter up with Forsythe during a round of golf. Kiley further reveals that he knows all about the doctor's shady past in another town, where both his mother-in-law and wife died of sudden heart attacks.

Kiley believes they were murdered with insulin ODs and asks Forsythe to spare his own life even though he's wise to the affair and these previous deaths. ""Why would I want to kill you?"" is the doctor's noncommittal response.

On an afternoon when Kiley is in Forsythe's office for a cyst removal, Vietnam vet Wendall Burton is also there to receive his daily sedative shot for junk withdrawal. After Burton gets woozy from the injection, Forsythe asks him to stir the fire with a cast iron poker. The young man is sent upstairs to nap while nurse Reta Shaw is out walking the dog. Forsythe fakes leaving before the matronly Shaw and when she's out, he dons rubber gloves then strikes the reclining Kiley several times in the head with that same poker.

After pouring a vial of the victim's previously-drawn blood onto Burton's jacket, he wakes the young man and sends him home. Forsythe hastily simulates a break-in of his drug cabinet, throws a syringe and bottle on the floor, then departs for Det. Lt. Joe Campanella's home to establish an alibi. Nurse Shaw returns with the dog, notices that Burton is no longer in the office, then discovers a barely breathing Kiley with his head bashed in. She frantically calls the doctor at Campanella's house. The two men drive to Forsythe's office, where Campanella wrongly concludes that Burton is the attacker...",1358380800,2,1838,4.881410256410256

2713940,4,B0002D3VRO,I'm a big fan of Barbara Bain (Mission Impossible) and thought I'd purchase this movie primarily because she was in it.  It was pretty good for the price but I was not overly impressed with it...,1218412800,,195,4.416666666666667

2713965,2,B0002D3VRO,Very dated.  Of course it was done a long time ago.  Kind of corny.,1438992000,,67,3.7142857142857144
2713966,3,B0002D3VRO,Watching this was like watching the old Columbo movies (though not as delightful) and it kept me watching through to the end - so what more can one say?  The acting was as good as these classic actors could perform - though I confess to not being a great fan of Barbara Bain; the story line was okay though not subtle - overall just fine for an afternoon's distraction.,1437264000,2,369,4.3478260869565215

2713976,4,B0002D3VRO,"A movie that was better than its packaging.  The film's appearance is what you'd expect from a film that has been sitting in a canister on a shelf in a warehouse on a studio back lot for four decades - not very good.  But the writing is above average.  In particular, the doctor makes some witty remarks about the nature of death and ""the winning side"" that are poignant.  The plot is solid enough, though the writers stretch incredulity a bit with regard to the victim's actions shortly before his death.  The twist is nicely done, though I'd have preferred the last ten seconds or so to have been deleted.  An enjoyable movie overall.",1421193600,5,636,4.535087719298246
