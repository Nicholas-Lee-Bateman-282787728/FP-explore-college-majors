2043171,2,B0001Y4MO0,This movie copy was not good.  There is a line that runs through the picture and the picture is not clear.  Unhappy as this is a good movie and one I hoped to watch more.,1356566400,,170,3.8285714285714287
2043172,4,B0001Y4MO0,"Though the story was based on real characters, it was a bit too much to believe. What it did accomplish was to give the viewer some of the atmospherics that was present in NYC Police precincts at the time. The uniforms, personalities  and the jargon brought back many memories. For personal reasons this was why I sought out this movie and for that alone, I am happy I did.

2043173,5,B0001Y4MO0,"Before seeing the film in the 1970's ""The Super Cops"" I read the true to life book written by L.H. Whittemore about 2 New York police officers. (Very highly recommended!) While law enforcement was rife with corruption these two men - Dave Greenberg & Bob Hantz - who grew up on the east coast had seen too many of their friends & loved ones lives destroyed & taken away by drugs. They were deeply determined to change their neighborhoods, to stop the endless tsunami of illicit drugs which were ruining lives. They started out as traffic cops busting drug dealers while they were supposed to be writing traffic citations. They wanted no part of graft, couldn't be bribed, they were just 2 men who wanted their home neighborhoods to be a safer place & they risked their lives & careers to achieve this goal. Vastly entertaining & hard to believe it is a true to life story. If there were more police officers like this today America would be a much better, safer place to live & for our children to be raised in.",1353110400,,1011,4.5
2043174,4,B0001Y4MO0,"Ahhhh. The 70's cop movies.....This was a pretty good movie and I can certainly relate to these guys. They were ready to go as soon as they hit the police academy. Working as a big city cop your ready to jump in and clean up the streets. These men had to jump through a lot of hoops and there hearts were in the right place. But there are specific departmental procedures, general orders and the police manual that you have to follow and if you don't your life as a police officer can be a living hell. Plus there are crooked and lazy cops, crooked and lazy supervisors, supervisors who are afraid of there own shadows and shaky/crooked DA's that they had to deal with. This stuff wouldn't fly in this day and time. These guys were a teriffic team no doubt and they did what they had to do. The movie plot was good, the acting was done well, the story line was great and it had a prefect ending. However. The cinematography could have been better as the movie was grainey and it looked like the DVD was copied from a VHS tape. Other then that I give it 4 stars. It's an enjoyable picture.",1350604800,3,1088,4.260869565217392
2043175,5,B0001Y4MO0,"I once saw this movie on television, and I liked it so much that I sought it out on Amazon. I still like it after all these years.",1340236800,,130,3.6785714285714284
2043176,3,B0001Y4MO0,Based on two NYPD cops in the 70s known as Batman & robin the actors did a good job. Also by adding a sense of humour was great.,1338163200,,128,3.607142857142857
2043177,5,B0001Y4MO0,"These cops were the real deal, the early 70's were a time of corruption and disolution in the police departments. Drugs were destroying society and yet popular sentiment was against the cops doing their jobs to stop hard dope. Plus corruption was so bad that these two cops were seen as bad for wanting to bust criminals. Why would they do it even on their time off? They had to fight against beaucracy and the streets as well. They weren't for sale and by the late seventies many cops were in jail and many district attorneys and judges too evidently. These guys story is told here simply and honestly. Every police officer should watch this movie and so should anybody who gives a damn about making things better. That's really what these guys were after. The lead actors are truly natural and lay it down in a understated way that's true to life. Honestly this is one of the best cop movies ever imo. The dvd looks ok and I personally hope that there is a blu ray release somday of this important story made.",1310256000,10,1011,4.47027027027027

2043179,3,B0001Y4MO0,"Wow! Some really cool scenes shot in Carroll Gardens,Brooklyn in 1974(back then it was just known as Red Hook). Watch especially for the scene on the corner of 1st Place and Court St, there is Sergi's  Candy store (now known as ""Thakor Brothers"" newsstand), then the reverse angle across the street and we see the ""Brand New"" Citibank which is still there! You can also see  ""The Pub"" on the corner of Carroll St and Court St.  That's not all! The next scene is shot on the corner of 2nd Place and Court St. You see a nice shot of the  old ""A & P"" Supermarket, and the old fashioned lamp post that used to be on the corner! For other cool Carroll Gardens movie scenes see ""The Idolmaker"" from 1979 (nice shots of Luquer St and Smith St and Nelson) and the brief scene in Goodfellas shot on W 9th Street and Smith St. Oh, and its a good movie too!",1131408000,6,846,4.203703703703703
2043180,5,B0001Y4MO0,"The book was great , couldn't put it down. But the movie is actually better in this case because the cop actors are so good! Even though its an action movie, these guys will make you laugh.
Guaranteed fun.",1060214400,17,205,4.282051282051282

2043183,5,B0001Y4MO0,"This movie is fantastic and fun. Don't judge the movie by the cover, it makes it seems silly, etc but it's not. It has some silliness but it's more like a lighthearted version of Serpico, not because of the tone of the movie, but because the actual characters are lighthearted and silly. Which is probably why they became popular with some of the community. Especially considering how brutal and corrupt the rest of the NYPD was in the 70's.",1434499200,,441,4.594936708860759
2043184,4,B0001Y4MO0,"The Seventies produced a lot of great cop flicks with ""The French Connection"" and ""Serpico"" being the best.  What gives ""The Super Cops"" street cred is that it is helmed by an African-American, Gordon Parks, who injects perspective and authenticity to the film.  The film concerns two rookie cops, Greenberg and Hantz (Ron Leibman and David Selby) whose beat is the mean streets of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant where narcotics and guns are epidemic.  When our heroes are not contending with the dealers, pimps, and pushers they have to concern themselves with the brass, Internal Affairs, and the then omnipresent Knapp Commission investigating corruption in the ranks of the NYPD.  The film is fast, funny, and gritty.  Leibman is the more colorful of the pair contrasting to the stoicism of Selby's character.  Doesn't quite reach the heights of a typical Sidney Lumet police procedural but it'll do.  On a note of trivia Greenberg and Hantz go by the handles of Batman and Robin.  Screenwriter Lorenzo Semple worked on the popular Sixties ""Batman"" series.",1433030400,4,1059,5.152046783625731

The package says digitally remastered, I don't think so. Dad wanted to keep it anyway. I personally think the movie is good, just not the video quality.",1413158400,2,315,4.448275862068965

2043193,4,B0001Y4MO0,"Warning: Early 70's Action Movie Ahead. With that being said, the movie is definitely worth watching or even adding to a collection. Good story based on actual events and real NYPD officers but with some over the top,somewhat silly scenes at times. But I think the silliness was intended to take the edge off what could have been just a very serious or even dark story. These cops were serious about being cops.",1388966400,3,411,4.6438356164383565

2043196,5,B0001Y4MO0,"I saw this film in a PG version at the drive-in when I was quite young. It was the supporting feature, but I can't remember the main feature on the double-bill which is a testament to the quality of this motion picture. THE SUPER COPS is funny and fast-paced. The performances by David Selby and, in  particular, Ron Leibman are terrific and there's a real chemistry between them. It's a simple story, but told with such vigor that it is relentlessly entertaining. Having now seen this Warner Archives release, I'm pleased to report it is the original R rated version with language and sporadic violence intact and it is all the more enjoyable. If you are a fan of gritty crime films from the seventies, this is a must-see and holds up to repeated viewings. Highly recommended.",1374624000,8,777,4.671532846715328

8018208,3,B0001Y4MO0,"This time a film derived from a true story becomes quite fascinating, possibly because of the nature of the real-life heroes, but probably because most of the truth was thrown out in favor of some exciting theatrics. It never quite gets a real good grip on you, but manages to hold on well. Excellent cast. (From the movie-review files of Alan M. Foss 1960-1985)",1450051200,,362,4.671875
