5958263,5,B00EZB5RTE,"I have been anxiously awaiting this documentary.  It was worth the wait. I loved the part where Billie Joe sees the
rehearsal for the first time. Seen American Idiot 2x can't wait to go back again and again and again.",1382313600,,217,4.425
5958264,5,B00EZB5RTE,"Well edited, plays more like a music video...even those who are not Green Day fans will appreciate this and be entertained.  Very nicely done!",1382140800,,142,4.916666666666667

5958266,5,B00EZB5RTE,"Broadway Idiot is a rarely seen behind-the-scenes look at the making of a Broadway show. Following Green Day front man Billie Joe Armstrong from a Bay Area punk to his Broadway debut, Broadway Idiot captures the spirit of Green Day's seminal album, American Idiot, and the subsequent stage musical, which debuted in Berkeley, CA, moved to Broadway, and is now on tour and playing throughout the UK. I felt like I was watching the show again.",1382054400,7,441,4.815789473684211
5958267,5,B00EZB5RTE,I was lucky enough to see the show twice on Broadway when Billie Joe performed. This back story is a fascinating journey of an amazing partnership. It brought so many great memories from the show. I even teared up when they showed the curtain rise for the first time. A great DVD about a fantastic show. A must see for Green Day fans.,1381795200,12,334,4.317460317460317
5958268,5,B00EZB5RTE,Loved the show in NY w/ this original cast - this story has been & still is the reality of todays Americas youth - the music & story line is an epic Rock&Roll opera that will remain timeless!,1381795200,,191,4.052631578947368

5958272,5,B00EZB5RTE,Awesome!,1471564800,,8,8.0
5958273,5,B00EZB5RTE,"Without a doubt one of the best documentaries of the process a musical takes from regional theatre to Broadway. It is a little heavy on Billie Joe, but he's an awesome dude and took a great opportunity to expand a work of art into something new and different. The DVD bonus features make the physical purchase a much better deal than streaming the film.",1470873600,,353,4.53125
5958274,4,B00EZB5RTE,This is as good as it gets without being able to see the whole musical. All I could want was more of the show itself.,1469232000,,117,3.72
5958275,5,B00EZB5RTE,"Such an inspirational tale to begin with, and then a look into the making of the Broadway play itself is truly amazing. Also,I had forgotten how great the body of work was that Green Day has created. It is hard to believe this slipped by me when it initially was released.",1461456000,,272,4.352941176470588

5958285,5,B00EZB5RTE,"I never, ever, ever watch movies twice -- until I saw this. I watched it 3 times this past weekend. And I tried to watch it at work Monday, but my Silverlight plugin crashed. I saw Green Day in 1995 in some metal building near Georgia Tech in Atlanta. I wish I'd had a brain in my head or some idea of what I was experiencing. 20 years later and I'm now obsessed. Maybe even a little in love with Billie Joe Armstrong. :) And Broadway. And I'm pissed I didn't get to see this show live.",1454371200,,486,4.020618556701031
5958286,5,B00EZB5RTE,"So glad I watched this! I really like Green Day and when this came out on Broadway, I was excited but I knew I'd never get to see it. However, I loved the album and the band. When I saw this on Amazon, I wanted to watch it but with a young family, even rocker mom's don't get to watch what they want. Luckily I watched it one day while writing unit plans. Wow! I figured it would be the actual show but it wasn't. This is the story of the show and how it came to be and a lot of other great stuff. This is well done and I enjoyed it!",1453939200,,533,3.725663716814159

I only wish I would have had the chance to see American Idiot on Broadway, and glad someone had the vision and courage to understand the message behind the music and turn it into an incredible story on stage that Green Day has been telling through their music for years. Sometimes it's nice to know that there's someone out there that "" gets "" you. You don't feel so alone.",1433980800,,661,4.357723577235772

5958339,5,B00EZB5RTE,"Ive always enjoyed the band - Their songs were always sensible, typically melodic and strong - by strong I mean they have always had teeth, they have meaning which can be easily adapted to many listeners -  they exhibit power, or remorse, or sorrow, or whatever emotion well - This may have seemed au unlikely transition and/or adaptation initially, but having a terrific producer with access to capitol and vison, a uniquely talented musical director, and ""broadway show style"" staff to advance the vision and scope of an already good body of work - made it seem ... almost a natural progression - I enjoyed the view and project overall - I worked in the rock and roll world for many years, i appreciated and understood his view, and then, the stark differences between the two formats and worlds of entertainment - CM",1433721600,,819,4.7272727272727275

5958344,5,B00EZB5RTE,"Looks like and amazing musical, wish they'd bring it back & make another tour. Not your typical Green Day songs, but then again kind of.

5958361,5,B00EZB5RTE,"I saw American Idiot on Brodaway the day after opening night, when Green Day took the stage for the encore. It was electrifying! How great to see the story behind the musical, how it came to be, and Billie Joe Armstrong's introduction to the world of theater. If you love Broadway, John Gallagher, Jr., and like Green Day even a little bit, you'll find this fascinating and in many ways moving. If you don't care for driving rock rhythms, maybe give it a pass. American Idiot is not a conventional show by any stretch!",1431129600,,518,4.5212765957446805

5958366,5,B00EZB5RTE,"I never review videos because there are so many other, usually better reviews, but this is probably the best documentary I have ever watched.  The story is fascinating and it unfolds in a fast-paced way without the long-winded talking head commentary or the dismal ending that seem to be the hallmark of so many documentaries.  I watched it twice because it's so richly illustrated that one can't take in everything at once.  I especially liked the switch up between rehearsal and production footage during numbers.
Mr. Armstrong lends a great air to this film. He appears to be authentically without guile, which is refreshing for a major rock star.  The backstory of Green Day's increasing interest and involvement in the production, even though they could have been expected to snub the entire thing, was engaging and the genuine respect and friendship between the cast and the band made me a fan.",1431043200,2,900,4.940397350993377

5958370,5,B00EZB5RTE,it was wonderful to watch how one groups brilliant art is reinterpreted by another artistic mind. Then all the minds join in to make something even more fantastic!  A must watch for Green Day and Broadway fans!,1430611200,,210,4.675675675675675
5958371,5,B00EZB5RTE,"Coming from San Antonio, previous to watching this production, my idea of a live performance was more likely to include a rider desperately clinging to the back of an 1800lb bull, or the Spurs baffling yet another would be contender. Did this make me uncultured? I never really thought so. OTHER cultured yes, but i never thought I was missing all that much -until I witnessed a whole community of people who's imagination allowed them to see into another world and who's talent allowed them to bring what they saw into ours so we could share in their visions. The characters they created were so vivid and unconventional that they had me laughing with delight. I always thought Broadway was like the Opera, something just not for the average guy, with little to offer me. Never again. Broadway is obviously magical place, full of people who live to entertain, more than they entertain to make a living. -Many thanks to them for allowing me to see it the way they do, and to share in their joy of producing a Broadway hit.",1430524800,,1022,4.6208791208791204

I'm a Green Day fan from before Kerplunk! and I wasn't the biggest fan of American Idiot, but having heard the backstories and seen how people interpret the lyrics, and how they translate to on-stage performance, I'm hooked again.

5958405,5,B00EZB5RTE,"First this is not the musical, it's a documentary down the road of the idea of an American Idiot musical.  You have the people behind the idea, you have Green Day mostly represented by Billie Joe explaining the lyrics or source of the lyrics, then you have the cast members, you mash it all together and you get the background of what it's like to be in the theater.

I can appreciate the musical we saw years ago in San Francisco more, knowing what I know about the process and everyone's hard work.  This really got away from the traditional Broadway musical.  I have to say that ""What's her name's"" voice is fantastic.",1429228800,,621,4.469026548672566

5958417,5,B00EZB5RTE,"I loved the play when I first saw it at Berkeley Rep. I loved it when I saw it again. And again. The play introduced me to music that I had no idea I loved, being slightly older than the original punk-rock set.  My entire family loves the play and the music, so I bought this because it just seemed like a little bit more of the fun.  Plus, I love supporting local artists.

The movie is interesting, fun, and lively.  If you loved the show or you love the music, or you love Green Day, or you love Berkeley Rep, get the movie. If you can't stand Billie Joe Armstrong, you might want to pass. There's a lot of him in there, including a clip of him singing Broadway show tunes as a kid. It certainly gives you some insight into his musical inspirations.",1408233600,9,752,4.165517241379311

It's fascinating to see how punk rock gets translated to Broadway - really, seemingly on opposite poles.  But because of the genius of the material and the interpreters (or re-interpreters), it all comes together amazingly. And Billy Joel himself is so accessible. Great doc.",1403481600,,388,4.863636363636363

Featuring the people who were key in the adaptation, this is a great view inside a part of the world most of us don't get to see.  Watching Billy hear the broadway versions of his songs for the first time got me in the feels every time.  I'm going to watch this many, many times...and then listen to the album!  PLEASE BRING US A MOVIE SOON!!!!!!!",1400025600,,459,4.3023255813953485
5958425,4,B00EZB5RTE,"As a huge fan of Green Day and absolutely being in love with their album American Idiot after many years, I was actually really intrigued when I heard the album had been adapted into a Broadway show. I finally got the opportunity to see the touring production of the show a few weeks ago when it came to D.C. While I didn't find it to be anywhere as great as some of the fans had made it out to be, I would say for the most part I found it to be an enjoyable, if flawed show. After seeing it, I found this documentary and thought it would be an interesting watch.

Now the description for the film makes it sound as it's mainly going to be covering Billie Joe Armstrong's transition to Broadway when he performed the role of St. Jimmy back when the show was in New York City. While this is certainly there, I would say the description for the film is slightly inaccurate as most of this is seen towards the end of the film. The film runs for a short 80 minutes, but it still gives a great behind-the-scenes look at the production of the show featuring many interviews with Green Day themselves and the producers and cast of the show along with music from the band a show as well. It starts by taking a look back at the production and release of the original album itself along with the early steps that were being taken to adapt it into a Broadway show. It then goes on to show the production of the actual show and Green Day's involvement with it. We then get to see the success of the show as it goes to NYC and Armstrong's transformation to acting.

As a documentary, this provides for the most part exactly what viewers will want to see. The film consist of a great collection of interviews and footage of production and the actual show itself. It was nice to see the band get time to talk about the production of the original album and the production footage of the Broadway show is great and covers everything from the songs to the set design. It's also a real treat getting to see actual footage of Armstrong performing as St. Jimmy in the show.

While this a very good documentary, I can't quite say it's great. The main problem is all the footage here is painting the show in a very positive light and doesn't show any of the difficulties or troubles of the production of the show. I find it hard to believe there weren't any and would've liked to see some of that stuff going on behind the scenes as a documentary should instead of just focusing on all the good stuff. I also will admit I got tired of hearing Michael Mayer after a while as he seemed a bit full of himself.

Despite my small complaints, Broadway Idiot is still a very good and entertaining documentary that in it's short running time gives just about everything fans of the show will want to see! Even if you weren't a fan of the show or have never even heard of it, you still might enjoy it as it provides plenty of great footage that will keep the viewer intrigued as any good documentary should!",1395187200,,2975,4.2976827094474155

Still my fave Bdwy show and I watch a lot of Bdway.  So of course I must watch this ""making-of"" when it came out!  Wish it was longer and more in-depth but it gave a good behind-the-scenes look at how Billie Joe worked with the producers to turn their albums into an actual show.  Really hoping this'll become a movie and BJA'll star as St. Jimmy!!  They should just show the actual Broadway show as the movie, no extra dialogue or plot needed!",1391731200,,608,4.2894736842105265

I only wish they would have done less history on the band and more on the Broadway performances, including an obviously lacking final show. I was there, row six, and Billie Joe not only performed in the role of St. Jimmy, but after the curtain and the bows and kudos and introduction to the production staff, Green Day took the stage and did a full-blown concert. It was absolutely magical, and should have been included in this documentary.",1385856000,5,525,4.422680412371134
