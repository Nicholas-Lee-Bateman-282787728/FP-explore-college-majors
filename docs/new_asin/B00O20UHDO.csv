6701852,3,B00O20UHDO,"Plot - Imdb
A single mother, plagued by the violent death of her husband, battles with her son's fear of a monster lurking in the house, but soon discovers a sinister presence all around her.

Review - 3/5
I viewed the trailer a few months back and thought the film looked original and refreshing. The monster (who is called 'The Babadook) looked appealing and frightful. He is a behemoth of a figure, but fearsome he is not. The movie creeps at a lethargic pace, the child who lost his father and is taken care of by his mother is unpleasant. His sobbing and wailing will shake your last nerve. The movie consist of 'The Babadook' creeping in and out of shadows. Screentime for the monster is kept to the minimum. In fact, he isn't present at all the first 45 minute or so. 'The Babadook' somehow possesses the mother and then it pulls an 'Amityville Horror' (only this time the mother is trying to kill her child). One of the most disappointing horror films of 2014. 'Annabelle' being the other major disappointment. Don't let the overhype fool you. It isn't original or unnerving. The ending was abrupt and humdrum. I shall put this one in the halls of mediocrity.",1414886400,2,1167,4.583732057416268
6701863,5,B00O20UHDO,"I can't believe this movie has such mixed reviews. This has to be one of the smartest, most well-written, and splendidly acted movies I've seen in a long time. I wouldn't really call it horror -- but it is terrifying -- more in a psychological way. There is not one wasted scene. Not one line of dialogue that is a throwaway. Alfred Hitchcock would have loved this movie. If you watch it alone at night, you'll be sleeping with the lights on after.",1525651200,,448,4.409638554216867
6701864,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook, masterfully directed by Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent, is one of the best horror movies of recent yearsmaybe even of recent decades. In her stunning directorial debut, Kent shows not merely promise as a filmmaker, but a rare talent that seldom shows through this strongly so early in a career. Creepy, emotionally poignant, tension filled, and mostly free of tired horror clichs, it is something special.

The film stars Essie Davis in a terrific, emotional turn as Amelia, a widowed mother still years later in a funk of despair over the loss of her husband on the day her son was born. Her son played by Noah Wiseman, a six-year-old named Samuel, is a very difficult child. He talks of dark subjects, makes weapons, and is prone to violent outbursts; he gets suspended from school and causes his devoted, though very emotionally distant, mother barriers with her sister and a potential love interest, and society generally speaking. As they become more isolated, things get stranger and more distressing in their home, especially when what appears to be a kids pop-up book appears without explanation, entitled Mr. Babadook, and when read is found to be nothing innocent at all (those dark, shifting pages are a terrific artistic creation used within this film, and its impossible to imagine this story told without it). It builds on a spine-chilling atmosphere with events and details, one upon another, very effectively, and hits the viewer with along the way moments of startling fright that add to but never overshadow the main situation. Motivations for certain acts aren't always clear, but that only adds, not detracts, from the overall effect.

This is in the running for my favorite horror film since the turn of the century: a genuinely scary film with great pacing, two strong lead performances, and enough originality to keep it compelling throughout. Beyond all it is Kent, who wrote the film as well as directed it, who deserves the largest credit for the exceptional product.

About the same time as this film came out another horror film was released, also by a woman directing her first feature film, and that I think also ranks among the best modern examples of the genre: Ana Lily Amirpours A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. What Kent and Amirpour prove (in addition to women who have made such films as Raw and The Invitation) is that if more female talent was given a chance to make the films they are capable of, or the kinds they desire, in whatever genre they choose, that many more would shine, and studios are doing a disservice by not considering filmmakers of that gender more often. I can probably count on one hand the number of horror movies since 2000 made by men that I could put alongside either of these two.

The Babadook Blu-ray has a few nice special features, including an hour-long segment of interviews with the filmmakers including Kent and star Davis thats quite interesting, though unfortunately no film commentary. On the film itself the video quality is very good, and the sound, heavy on the surround, is really excellent. Play it in the dark with good sound systemitll be a fantastic, chilling horror experience.",1525564800,,3181,4.896103896103896
6701865,5,B00O20UHDO,"While horror and the supernatural is perhaps my favorite fictional literary genre, I cant say that horror and the supernatural are my favorite film genres. Perhaps it is because in literature cheap shocks, like a sudden noise or the appearance of a monster, cannot jump out of a page, so writers have to take greater care in creating an imaginative atmosphere of dread and fear. One of the great horror stories, Oliver Onions The Beckoning Fair One,  may bore those who like their shocks cheap, but for those with the patience, its slow, inexorable grind to a conclusion that challenges readers to make their own determination of what is or isn't reality is well worth the journey. The Babadook is one of those rare films that understands that true horror straddles the line between madness and reality, upending assumptions and keeping its cards close to the vest until the atmosphere of terror is sufficiently developed to show it to maximum effect. Currently the Babadook has received a 98 percent fresh rating out of 219 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, testifying to its excellence. Yet only 72 percent of viewers liked it. I do not understand the discrepancy, save perhaps for the fact that many people go to horror movies these days with a certain expectation, and a lazy one at that. Perhaps you have to have an appreciation of both literature and classic film to like films like this.

The Babadook opens with an apparent nightmare that the mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), has concerning a car accident in which her husband was killed. Her six-year-old son Sam (Noah Wiseman) also has nightmares about a monster called the Babadook, which Amelia repeatedly attempts to convince him does not exist. Sam persists in his belief that Babadook is real, but because his terror seems the product of some psychological abnormality, his increasingly bizarre behavior eventually drives his mother to the brink, especially when he constructs weapons to combat the supposedly nonexistent apparition.

The appearance of a picture book called Mister Babadook that contains frightening pop-up imagery seems to be the source of Sams belief in the monster, and Amelia attempts to get rid of it, hoping that everything will return to normal, which with the help of tranquilizers she convinces a reluctant doctor to prescribe to her son seems to bring some calm to the house. But not for long; the book reappears, this time with new pages which warn that the Babadook will never go away, and will only get stronger the more you disbelieve in him. Not only that, he will inhabit your body and cause you to do unspeakable things. Amelia burns the book, now hoping that it is just some sinister prowler lurking about. She goes to the police, but since she cannot provide any credible information they only look upon her story as the product of some disturbed woman. Meanwhile, Sam insists that the monster is real and will never go away.

Up to this point the viewer is led along believing that Sam may be the monster driving his mother crazy, but at the midpoint there begins a clear and dramatic shift in that dynamic after Amelia catches a brief glimpse of what appears to be the monster from the book through the window of the neighbors house. Sam now appears to be the sane one, because he had always believed in the existence of the Babadook and was prepared to do battle with it and eventually conduct the rite of exorcism himself; his hiding of a tranquilizer that his mother forced on him is done because he knows he must be awake when it is time to help his mother. Sam knows that it was his mothers refusal to accept the existence of the monster and protect him from it that has allowed it in and become stronger, and it is now threatening both of their lives. Unlike other films of this sort, there is no outside savior; mother and son are fighting alone, because everyone else (save perhaps the old woman who lives next door), assumes that they have a problem of their own creation.

While this film has received near universal acclaim and deservedly so, reviews rationalizing why this is so have been all over the map, especially those taking a gender politics view of the proceedings, mainly choosing to base their opinion from the first half of the film when the mother seems to be the victim of a crazed male child. But for other reviewers there are a wide range of question marks leading to different conclusions. For example, is the Babadook real or some nightmarish invention born of a refusal to come to terms with the death of the father, while he was driving Amelia to the hospital on the very day Sam was born? The appearances of the monster are always brief and shrouded in darkness, so the question of reality is always present. Where did the book come from? Amelia had once been a writer; could she have composed it herself, from some dark place in her imagination that blamed her son for the death of her husband? Was Amelia possessed by the monster, or was she acting out on repressed feelings of anger toward her son?

 A few reviewers found the tacked-on ending problematic, suggesting that the Babadook was real, but more a simple creature which had taken human form (or at least the garments of one) to appear more frightening; if the film had ended with an open-ended possibility of the reality of the monster, it might have been a more effective finish. But that is only the minutest of quibbles. This is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen, because it knows what true fright is, the kind that you lay in bed covering your eyes with a blanket hoping that whatever it is in that dark corner isn't real and goes away. First-time writer/director Jennifer Kent cant be credited highly enough for conceiving this film, but reviewers fail to mention the contribution of Polish cinematographer Radoslaw Ludczuk, who is so unknown in the U.S. that The Babadook is his only credit on IMDB.  As the behind the scenes extra on the video release shows, it is clear that his special expertise was invaluable to the look and feel of this film.",1525305600,,6055,4.711048158640226

The Babadook, created by Jennifer Kent is a terrifying and suspenseful film with an intriguing entity that is out of a storybook. It all starts with a grieving single mother and her troubled child, Sam, that is afraid of monsters. Throughout the film you have an intimate feel of the grief that Amelia is experiencing through her surroundings; especially through the house they live in with the gloomy layout and the basement with all the husbands things. Right from the beginning youll get sucked up in the emotional turmoil Amelia goes through on a daily basis.
The Babadook is not just your average horror movie either, mostly because throughout the film you're questioning what/who is the real monster here? Is the Babadook real, or is it just an intense mind game?
At the closer of the film it leaves the audience with a satisfied feeling where everything is starting to look up for the characters, and youll feel like everything is going to be okay. Even though there are a lot of questions left unanswered in the end, and you know that Amelia and Sam have a lot to work out, the audience feels like the worst is behind them and that they can both move on now.",1522022400,,1186,4.652380952380953
6701871,4,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook brings to life the feelings and emotions we as humans try to shove in the back of the closet of our lives, trying to forget them and acting like they don't exist. Death and depression are all too common in todays society, but what people don't realize is that it doesnt always happen right away or is forgotten in an instant. Through the dull and blue colors that this film starts out in, we get a sense that there is a looming emotion that we haven't yet placed our finger on but are aware that its there. This real-life monster takes a form in this film, and because its made into something visceral and physical that we can see, we believe its real; unlike our world, where if its not seen to the naked eye, its not there. Although the film is slow to start, lulling you to believe that this might be a slow and boring ride, Essies portrayal of just how manic, distorted, and out of tune with reality one can become with grief replaces boredom with edge-of-your-seat anticipation of whats to come next. This movie isn't for those wanting jump scares and cheap thrills, its for those willing to see beyond whats being presented and realizing that not always will monsters be living under the bed, but in you; and that they won't always go away once the sun rises, theyll continue to knock on your door, waiting for you to let them in.",1521936000,,1349,4.421686746987952

The Babadook, being the debuts of Jennifer Kents Directing career, is a masterpiece of a film that is a must watch and should be seen multiple times to really appreciate the cinematography that is placed throughout the film. This film has a very strong emotional build up that really pulls the audience into the film to feel the emotions and struggles that Amelia goes through. Grief and depression as well as stress being a large factor in this film with consistent motif of dark gloomy colors and the Babadook, in some cases, being the darkness itself. Amelia, being a widowed mother trying to raise her son, who does not make anything easy for her, is trying to get through a difficult time of the year. Coming up on the 7th anniversary of the day her husband had passed away which also happens to be their sons 7th birthday, things around the house begin to take a turn for the worse. As the film proceeds we see the gloom and stress that Amelia must go through raising her son whom she believes to have an imagination that is much more active than other children his age. But is quick to realize his imagination may not be as crazy as it seems, as a mysterious beast from a childrens book begins to raise havoc in their small home.",1521936000,,1251,4.4868421052631575

Watch it and find out.
I gave the film 5 stars, not because it's the next ""Psycho"", but because it was a decent horror film and did what it was supposed to do.

One negative aspect of this film is, (IMHO) both the mom and child are suffering from depression.  There are scenes which depict  the condition and its manifestations, and other people's apathetic and even angry responses.  I found this theme somewhat disturbing.  If you suffer from the condition, you may want to avoid this film.

6701921,4,B00O20UHDO,"4.5 Stars. ""The Babadook"" is not a typical horror film. It is unusual in that it tells a serious story, and can be interpreted as depicting mental breakdown in progress, with all ""paranormal"" goings-on reflecting the inner turmoil of the protagonist. The mother-son relationship is the core of the film, along with the mother's inability to accept the car-accident death of her husband, 7 years ago. We actually have two mentally handicapped individuals depicted: the son has some serious issues, and the mother is still in morning after her loss 7 years ago. Both individuals feed upon the other, causing the Babadook's importance to increase in power and take over both of their lives. The kid's rather normal fear of monsters is taken up and amplified by the mother in her own mental breakdown. No outsiders actually are witness to the ""monster"" or out-of-the-ordinary happenings. All these ""happenings"" seem to occur only from the mother's point of view. Her little boy does not actually claim to see anything, though his imagination successfully terrorizes him.

This is a bit ""scary"", but it is not just a horror story intended to scare you. So, those looking for simple, scary monsters may be disappointed. It is not ""The Candyman"", in other words. It is an intelligent film -- regardless of genre-- and can be compared somewhat to the surrealist horror film ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", from the 1930s (I think). Or, there are other psychological horror films that are comparable. The internal turmoil of the characters are depicted, along with the interface with the external world. That's not easy to do successfully.

The acting, cinematography, script, sets, etc. are all extremely professional. There is no feeling of ""low-budget"" amateurism. To the contrary, this film was done on the highest level of film-making. Surprising, since this is the first film made by this director.

The ""extras"" on the dvd are minimal. But, the interviews with cast and crew was very informative. Highly recommend watching the interviews, as the themes and context of the film are well-explained in detail. You will get a lot out of it.",1509408000,,2133,5.036827195467422

I'm not sure if the Babadook was real or if this woman had just gone crazy. Perhaps the Babadook was a manifest of her unnatural regret from losing the ""wrong"" person. Guess what: I really don't care. I'm no postmodernist but I am grateful for much of the art it has produced. While I think some movies need clear resolutions and concrete answers I think some are better served by making us ponder. I own several movies that I have watched my whole life and will watch the rest of my life because they are bigger than the screens I have watched them on. They require dissection and cerebral work and I love it. ""The Pabadook"" is not meant to be watched passively, one is to really dive in and wrestle with its images and intellectual content. As I arrived closer to the ending I began to worry that the film would disappoint me and we would see the main character in a psych ward or it would be a dream or some political metaphor. Instead I was treaded to a tale that respects me as a participant not a mindless drone looking for a cheap thrill. Besides those cheap thrills are present in most movies being made these days. Thankfully ""The Babadook"" is much more. From a technical perspective I thought it was equally brilliant. Many wonderfully creepy scenes that I thought came close to rivaling those in ""The Ring."" The story took some cues from ""The Shining"" and a good story teller doesn't always have to reinvent the wheel. The acting was superb! I'll say that the music and sound were equal to the prowess of every other element of the movie. The only thing that turned me off to the movie is that some scenes that were meant to be scary were funny. Also the movie shifts from the book and visions of the Babadook to the mother and her internal struggle. That shift, although not forced, still lacked a clear logic. As a postmodern work I understand that will happen from time to time but there is still a sense of transition or emotional momentum that ought to be present but the shift in focus just sort of happened and it was a little empty. I didn't think the main character's inverted motives that worked against her own interests as the tension  began to ramp up was moments that were entirely earned. I didn't see a reason for her to ""side"" with the Babadook. Yes one could conclude some form of possession but even that would seem hasty and cheap. So the movie tried but it failed in my opinion. Regardless I highly recommend ""The Babadook."" I watch one horror a year for Halloween and this one definitely made it a memorable one!",1509321600,,2572,4.472340425531915

6701924,4,B00O20UHDO,"Very scary, eventually.

Reading the praise for this movie on the DVD box made me think I was in for quite a scary movie. It is eventually, but be patient. For the first almost half of the movie I was thinking this was going to be a 2-star movie, 3 at best, it was so slow to get going. But the last half brings it up to a 4.

Spoiler Alert**********************************************************************************************************************************************************

When the ""Mister Babadook"" book ends up back on single mother Amelia's (Essie Davis) porch, the movie starts improving. Opening the book she had previously destroyed, she sees in the small figures in the pop-up book the horrors of her murdering the family dog, her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman), and finally, herself. In addition to the sinister spiritual force, themes in the movie include repressed grief, sleep deprivation, and mental illness. I also thought of postpartum depression, while the sinister spiritual force made me think of possession. In an interview among the extras, Essie Davis says of the movie:

""It's about facing your trauma and facing your grief and expressing your grief ... in order to have any kind of balance.""

""The Babadook"" made me think of the movie ""The Shining"" (1980) which Essie Davis also mentioned in the interview:

""It's a little bit like 'The Shining' ... Amelia is like Mom and Dad in 'The Shining' ... [S]he is in terror and then she's (she is) terror ... It's like one-third incredibly deep grief, one-third being terrified and one-third terrorizing.""

Essie Davis also says of her character's struggle to love the son born the same day her husband died in a car accident 7-years earlier:

""She (Amelia) really does want to love her son.""

In addition to thinking about how a mother in postpartum depression may struggle to love a son or daughter, this also made me think about how some women who have not grieved a past abortion are said to struggle with emotional coldness, distance, and an inability to bond properly with subsequent children. But healing and better days are always possible with prayer and/or competent support and/or professional help.",1508889600,,2193,5.172316384180791

This film brings a new perspective on what is scary and it works magnificently. There are also inventive camera tricks (watch as the mother slowly falls into her bed (look closely and you will see it). This is no ordinary horror film like those that come from Jason Blum's Blumhouse Productions (i.e OUIJA, one of the worst horror films of 2014).

6701942,5,B00O20UHDO,"The film THE BABADOOK is the closest film I can recall to that of REPULSION by Roman Polanski in which Ms Catharine Deveuve plays a mentally ill beautiful single woman confined to an apartment over a weekend and we watch her descend into murder and madness through a range of emotions from A to B.
This is unfair criticism as Ms Deneuve is required to play a catatonic character. That film reveals her descent in great directing,photography,special effects, music (Chico Hamilton no less) and so on.  In contrast, the burden of THE BABADOOK falls heavily upon Ms Essie Davis' acting in which she shows the descent of a working single mother from normality into ""madness"". Ms Davis demonstrates a range of acting skills rarely seen on the screen. Significant acting support is provided by child actor Noah Wiseman.
The acting of Ms Davis in which she is able to give depth to the ambiguities contained in the script - are we watching the mental visions of the mother? Or the mental creations of the child/magician? Is the mother a victim of a child monster? Is the child a victim of a mother mentally broken by the demands of, firstly,  guilt and loss over a past car accident in which her husband was killed driving her to hospital to give birth to him,secondly, by  working with elderly dementia patients whom she is unable to ever satisfy, thirdly, by comparing herself to other mothers who seem blind to her pain, and loneliness, whilst bragging about their ""happy"" children and respective partners' success?
In Australia, there are over a million single mothers, and some very few succumb to, what some may suggest, is understandable madness and in their mad grief, kill their children. It is like a modern Greek Tragedy being played out in the suburbs rather than the palace of the King.
The film THE BABADOOK is a fine film and much more than just a ""horror"" film. Nor is it just a field day for the Freudian's amongst us. Apart from it's outstanding craftsmanship it touches on quite serious modern issues of family and society, whilst providing sufficient ambiguity in its presentation to satisfy many different kinds of viewers.",1501632000,4,2137,4.801630434782608

It has absolutely earned a spot along other recent contemporary instant classics like The Conjuring, Sinister and It Follows, all the while maintaining a unique edge and a stand out storyline.

By the by, the kid is SUPPOSED to be annoying. That's part of the entire idea of the film. The mother is trying her utmost best to cope with the grief and trauma she's been dealt in the loss of her husband, all the while having to also cope with her annoying, needy, problem child (who has his own trauma to live with). It plays into the taboo territory of a mother being driven mad by her own child and fostering hatred for it over time. The Babadook is the monstrous personification of trauma, grief, and loss.

6701964,5,B00O20UHDO,"Pretty darn good. Not a typical scary horror film, but rather a disturbing psychological drama about a six-year-old boy who still imagines monsters in his closet at night. Every night his mom has to read him to sleep with bedtime stories. One night, the boy picks a book called Mister Babadook, a book which the mother does not recall ever seeing in the boy's room before. It turns out to be a horrible book about how Mr. Babadook is coming, and if you let him in, you'll never get rid of him. Well, things go from bad to worse as the kid claims he has seen Mr. Babadook in the house, then the sleep-deprived mom thinks she sees him. She starts to really become unhinged. Well, cut to the ending... everything seems to be relatively normal again, but after the credits roll, you really sit back and say, ""What just happened in this story?"" Did the boy have emotional problems that started to affect his mom? Did the mother have emotional problems, and perhaps this whole Mr. Babadook thing was just a projection of her own dark thoughts? Was the Mr. Babadook character created in the mind of either the mother or the son as an entity on which to blame the abnormal outbursts of either character? Or was Mr. Babadook real and the film's story played out exactly how the events happened? I'm sure there are other interpretations I have not even thought of as of yet.

So, all in all, a VERY intriguing, intelligent film. I went into it thinking it was going to be just another good, creepy horror film (judging by the picture in a magazine that I remembered). It took me a while to understand it was not that kind of film and to adjust my mindset. The impact of it and the various interpretations only hit me about an hour after I watched it.

The performances by Essie Davis as the mother and Noah Wiseman as the son are natural and flawless. You can just feel the emotions as though you are watching situations in real life, whether those scenes are totally rooted in everyday situations, or in scenes of the mother getting fed up with these monster stories her screaming child keeps insisting are real. There is one crucial point where she just can't take it any more and screams at him, ""Why can't you be normal!"" and another one where she is desperately trying to get some sleep and the kid comes into the bedroom pestering his mom to please make him some breakfast because he's so hungry. She finally cracks and screams ""What I need is sleep! If you're so hungry, why don't you go and eat some shit!"")

I reiterate, the performance by Essie Davis is impeccable. You feel her denial when people tell her that her son has serious emotional problems, you feel her pain as she finally admits that to herself, you feel her anger as she starts to feel her anger toward the boy, you feel her hopelessness at her realization that she cannot control this situation, you feel her gradual mental breakdown. Never at any point did I get the feeling that she was overacting or ""that scene just blew it for me."" Honestly, this was one of the best performances I have seen by an actress in a film in the last decade.",1493078400,3,3105,4.463028169014085

Kent opens her film with a beautiful rendition of a car crash beginning with a close-up of Amelia being shaken in a dark space until the camera zooms out into a full-body shot of her falling into her bed edited in slow-motion with layered sounds of her sons voice and deep chords to create a surreal, dreamlike state which is the mood for most of the film. The film operates on a nightmare motif, bringing viewers back to their childhood fear of the monster under the bedyoure going to want to unearth your nightlight after viewing this film.

The editing in this film is mesmerizing with multiple usages of cross-cutting to build tension; an example of this is a scene where Amelia is massaging her temples at the kitchen table while her son causes a raucous in another room, one of the first signifiers that Amelia is nearing her edge.

Sound is also exquisitely utilized in this film as Kent makes the viewer privy to Amelias nervous breakdown by allowing us to hear the chaotic and amplified voices and noises infesting Amelias mind. This film pays homage to Tobe Hoopers Texas Chainsaw Massacre with an extreme close-up of an eye, Steven Spielbergs Poltergeist with its closet-as-a-portal imagery and has intertextuality with Charlotte Perkins Gilmans short story The Yellow Wallpaper through its raw entrance into the psyche of a woman who is going crazy (not to mention the direct linkage to this story where Amelia peels off wallpaper in her kitchen). Kents film is an elegant and frightening portrayal of the descent of a single mother. The notion of the descent appears in the film literally as Amelia is shot in a grounded manner and metaphorically as we see her character unravel. Giving viewers a psychological look into the world of motherhood, Kent delivers a tear-inducing and genuine account of just how much it takes to raise children.",1490572800,2,2119,4.864265927977839
6701975,4,B00O20UHDO,"SPOILER ALERT

Jennifer Kent created a phenomenal physiological horror film that goes deeper then monsters and the supernatural. The film uncovers our biggest fear, ourselves. The film depicts the fear of what lives inside us, the emotions we have to live with and control.  The film will have you thinking about it for days after. The Babadook can be different depending on who you are.  You can take it literally as a creepy monster haunting a mother and son. You can also make sense of the Babadook as an experience of mental illness,  post-traumatic stress disorder or domestic violence. Finally you could take the Babadook as grief, loss, and depression. This film allows you the opportunity to make sense of the Babadook on your own and allows for your own interpretation and fears to put all the pieces of the film together.

I believe the Babadook is a metaphor for grief and mental illness. Amiela, the mothers grief over her husband has crippled her ability to function, and prevented her from bonding with her son. I think she created the book, because she mentioned at the birthday party that she used to write childrens stories. You can also see how she has hallucinations through the cockroach infestation kitchen scene. The monster was her mental illness and grief and that by the end of the film she learns to cope with. She learned to love her son despite the grief of losing her husband on the day she gave birth to her son.",1490572800,2,1442,4.7063492063492065
6701976,5,B00O20UHDO,"An experience that each one of us can relate to is loss. Jennifer Kents, The Babadook, forces us to engage in the challenging aftermath after losing a husband and a father years after the accident. The exhausting toll this tragedy has on a widowed, single mother and the isolating development of a hyperactive child in a single parent home creates an immediate, empathetic relationship that has the audience feeling desperately sad and vulnerable. The dark and dull mise-en-scene brings to life the gloomy, melancholy demeanor of Sam and Amelias home that leave the two characters plagued off from the people who love them most. The draping and dramatic shadows that cover every inch of the house encloses the monster lurking inside, patiently waiting for the right time to attack. I applaud Jennifer Kent for creating such a possessive, haunting, and original type of monster that feeds off our deepest fears. I also want to acknowledge Essie Davis undeniably brilliant portrayal of Amelias character development from beginning to end. This psychoanalytical horror divides the audiences perception of what we want to see and what we actually see.

If you're into horror movies like The Blair Witch Project or Kubrick's The Shining then you'll get a kick out of this, but if you're going into it expecting it to be like Aliens or some of the more visceral horror films then you're going to be disappointed.

My only real complaint with the movie itself is that the characters can be a bit cheesy at times, and you will honestly wish the main character would kill her son at points in the movie, but other than that it's a very good movie I'd totally recommend to any fans of horror who enjoy the more psychological aspects of it.",1485216000,,801,4.486301369863014

I can't say that anything since then has truly helped, but there are things that seem to suck less than other things.  There are also some things that remind me of what the feeling of being soothed used to feel like.  My cats are the only thing that aren't a facsimile of what feeling good used to be, my cats are the genuine article.  Eating unhealthy things in an unhealthy manner also makes the time go by, to be frank.

This movie, for me it was the first thing that came down to my level and addressed me at the truly miserable level I was at, at the time i watched it.  The woman's misery is just so authentic, and I mean that in how she is written, in how she is acted, and in how the scenes are shot, how the film is cut.  It just came right down to my eye level and stared at me and what a horrific beast I'd let myself live as until then, no pretense, just authentic misery.  There is a comedy in it, the kind that only people who've been there in one form or another can see.  At the end there was a line the little boy says, he's yelling it to his mother as she's fighting the ""babadook"", and it was like a bolt out of the blue for me.  That line was the first thing that felt like ""help"" since my fiances death, and this movie was the first thing that felt like ""comfort"". On top of that, it is funny, naked, scary humanity.

6702041,5,B00O20UHDO,"I'm going to assume you've read other reviews on this movie. I'm just going to add a few thoughts. There are many reasons that this is a fantastic movie. One of them is a sort of realism. The woman isn't some saint. Her child isn't some cartoon child. He's loveable and sweet but annoying. He can be quite a handful, but he's a good kid. There are wonderful, nice people that try to help the main character and there are more crappy people who don't. In other words, in contrast to some critics of this movie, I didn't feel like I was watching a by-the-numbers movie, but I guess when they say it was by-the-numbers and clicheed, they are talking about the horror elements, while I am talking about the non-horror elements.

One thing that I love about this movie is that it's not just pure heavy-handed allegory. It's aaaaalmost an allegory, but not strictly. The Babadook is a real monster and they really have to overcome it, even if it is a metaphor. What's it a metaphor for? Everyone says grief. They are wrong. This woman isn't struggling with grief. She's struggling with mental illness. The grief is just the conduit for the mental illness, the proximate cause, but grief alone couldn't even begin to account for this lady's troubles. Anyway, I normally dislike allegory, but this isn't strict allegory. I don't want to watch a movie about a sad lady struggling to raise her child. I don't want to watch a movie about a lady fighting off a ridiculous and pointless monster, but when the monster is real, but is also a metaphor for the meaningful struggles she's having in her life, that's a compelling combination.

So that's why this is one of the best movies ever. It seems like professional critics hate fantasy. I don't mean elves and dragons and stuff. I mean otherworldly things, including dragons and elves, but also monsters and space-travel and aliens and stuff. The professional critical world, for reasons I don't understand, always poo-poos such things. Then there are lots of people who only want such stuff. They want pure escapism. I think both of these groups are wrong. I want wizards and dragons and elves and monsters and robots and aliens and space travel and all that, but I want it to have a subtext of relatable, relevant meaning for the lives we live.

And that is a perfect description of the Babadook.",1476057600,2,2336,4.665048543689321
6702042,5,B00O20UHDO,"A scary children's book will kill you to death. Seems not so interested?
How about this film is even better then <LIGHTS OUT><DON""T BREATHE>?
This movie is that good.

There is this problem child living with the mother. His father was killed while driving the mother to the hospital while delivering the child.
The child was born safe but when he was born, he has problem dealing with people in a strange way. He is not a bad looking or anything but he just makes problems.
For instance when he is with this girl, he just pushes her from the toy like house which is pretty high from the gound and she broke her teeth. IT was really dangerous.

The more problem is he's got this really scary picure book called BABADOOK and he is keep telling his mom that the charactor Babadook is with them and he's gonna get them. He is scary, he is gonna harm us all.
The mother of course doesn't believe him.

But one day she sees this really really scary dark shadowy figure.
More problem is he goes inside her mouth and from that time she is totally changed.
He becomes vicious, mad and even hits her son.

The dealing with this problem is very very intense and make us scare to teach.

The monster and all the enviornment that the director created is pure magically scare and you just have to grab someting to hold on.

The idea of children's book charactor comes to the real world is not totally original. A-Ha's Take on Me and all.
But the fact that this guy is trying to do harm is still very very scary.
The sound design include the voice of the Babadook is just so so intensive and fierce to death.

This is one movie you should watch with someone with you.
Or if you have a strong heart maybe alone just to enjoy fullheartedly.

6702044,3,B00O20UHDO,"I like supernatural thrillers and horror movies.  When a coworker said THE BABADOOK was one of the scariest movies he had ever seen, I knew I had to watch it. Welll. scary? Maybe a little and toward the end. Unfortunately, it is seriously lacking in the scare factor.

A widowed mother (Essie Davis) is raising a troubled 6-year-old (the remarkable Noah Wiseman). Are his behavioral issues a development issue or simply due to an overprotective pop-up book called MISTER BABADOOK to her son. At first, it appears to be a child's book but each page becomes more threatening and directed at her.

THE BADADOOK is a version of so many supernatural thrillers that we have seen before. Is the mother going crazy or is a real evil lurking? There are tense moments and a few scares but it just doesn't have that ""something"" that makes the film unusual. Noah Wiseman as the son is incredible. He actually transforms from a trouble and annoying kid to his mother's protection. Great transformation.

It's an OK film and I know some people really love the film. For me, it was sorely lacking in the surprise and the scare factors. It's never clear what the Babadook is and where he comes from.

The monster is so cheaply done you could get better quality in the made for tv horror film ""It"" (yes Tim Curry in a clown costume beats this).

The youngster begins to display erratic, obnoxious behavior and talks about a mysterious Mr. Babadook- a ominous creature from a mysterious pop-up book he found and whom Amelia read to him one dark night. Fearing the book is the cause of Sams paranoia and disturbed by the books message, Amelia rips it up and discards it. However, the book soon re-emerges- reassembled on her front doorstep and contained within its sinister pages are added elements to Mister Babadooks tale of terror, and it now involves Amelia and her terrified son.

Directed by Jennifer Kent, The Babadook is a smart, psychological horror film. It combines horror, drama and humour very successfully and the scares and atmosphere is expertly handled - from the dark rooms and sinister voices, to brief glimpses of a monsters chilling silhouette. The added touches, even the small ones, contribute in making the over-all feeling of this film quite unsettling. That key moment when Amelia reads what appears to be a clumsy story of a child-hood, mischievous creature is great and perfectly captures the films essence. It starts off almost whimsical but with each turn of the page, it unfolds into something far more darker, its images, far more diabolical. Although some of the characters are grating at times - for instance, Sam, in some scenes is almost unbearable; it is necessary to showcase all of their downward spiral into what appears to be some sort of madness. Davis' performance is effective and compelling to watch. She delivers the stand-out performance.

The titular monster - the infamous ""Babadook"" - maintains its frightening edge up until the final moments. Kent decided not to over-expose it. It is mentioned a lot; it is heard a lot yet it's appearance is kept shrouded in darkness so instead of becoming a horror film clich, it remains mysterious - a diabolical menace playing with the characters' fears and messing with their minds. As the film progresses, the tension escalates and although the last quarter of the film reaches a certain level of absurdity, overall, it works.

""The Babadook"" should be a welcome addition to any horror film fan's catalogue. It is well crafted, well acted and it delivers in being creepy - I was pleasantly surprised by it. Let's also not forget it has one heck of a scary monster that is all mystery, all fear; it is omni-present, dark and malevolent. It is well worth your time even if it means, for some- a few, maybe many sleepless nights. Remember the book? Remember the rhyme? You can't get rid of the Babadook. Mwahahahaha!

This movie shows how grief can override emotions into a living hell. One by one, the son and then the mother starts to go mad. It shows how strong a bond between a widow and her son can be as well.

It reminds me a lot of Polanskys Repulsion: the pacing, the cracks in the walls, her starring up at the ceiling, the old woman seen through the key-hole, all trade-mark shots from Repulsion.
There are already hundreds of reviews regarding the plot and the meaning of this film, so I won't repeat what has already been written.
I haven't seen any of the extras and interviews, but the Blu-ray PQ is very good. I do have a problem, however, with the sound. I had to turn the volume on my TV all the way up in order just to hear the dialog, and even then, I had to pay attention.
The film rhythm is almost European style filmmaking, which really helps when you're making a horror film which relies on the viewers imagination. You would NEVER see anything like this out of Hollywood.
It does, for me, have a clich satisfying ending, but I can see the need for it, because there is the welfare of a child to consider.
Overall, this is the best horror film I have seen in a very long time.
I can understand modern American audiences being bored to death with it though.
So, I would only recommend this to people who like foreign films, or have patience and imagination.",1471910400,,1429,4.296296296296297

6702071,4,B00O20UHDO,"I'd heard of this film long before I saw it - it's been out quite a while but just the other day I decided to give it a whirl.  I honestly have to say that the movie is genuinely scary - and only because whatever Babadook is - the viewer can never really know.  And once it's there, you can't get rid of it.

The story is about a widow named Amelia and her young son, Samuel - the family is still trying to deal with the tragic loss of Amelia's husband - Samuel's father - who had died while driving Amelia to the hospital to deliver him.  The movie begins around the time of Samuel's birthday which is a difficult time for Amelia although like much going on it the movie - it is never definitely spoken about.  The child is difficult - he has an overactive imagination, troubles sleeping because he's obsessed with ""monsters"", has difficulty with socialization and - as the film progresses he grows increasingly disturbed, anxious and violent.  He is dismissed from the school he attends, rejected by his bitchy aunt and provoked into violence by his scathing cousin.  Amelia watches all this without much emotion, which is part of why the movie is so scary.  She loves her son but the viewer can tell that she resents him nearly as much as she loves him - he's difficult and she starts to grow increasingly unable to deal with his tantrums and his inability to sleep...he literally drives her into insanity.

The Babadook, whatever it is, enters their lives through a very creepy pop-up book that Amelia finds herself reading to Samuel to - ironically - help him sleep.  Right then and there, whatever fears and paranoia that Samuel has been suffering finally have a name and a face - a creepy, dark, hat-wearing, long-fingered and odd voiced - Babadook.

At first Amelia dismisses the book, throwing it out and then later - when it returns - burning it and going to the police who don't believe her.  As the film progresses the viewer no longer knows what is in Amelia's mind and what is real and Samuel is always there in the background trying to protect his mother from whatever it is that has possessed her and begs her 'not to let it in'.

To me, Babadook is a manifestation of the grief, loss, confusion and depression that Amelia has been dealing with since her husband's death and how all these things she hasn't dealt with properly begin to make her lose her mind - sort of like if depression and despair took on a corporeal existence.  Amelia becomes possessed by the feelings of endless sadness and anger she feels in her life and towards her son.  Samuel never believes that it is his mother that says and does such horrible things to him - and it is shown in the scene where she's trying to strangle him and he is gently stroking her face.  And the viewer knows Amelia loves her son fiercely, shown in her final ""showdown"" with Babadook in which the viewer is made to believe that she is able to fight it off.

But the premise is that you can never get rid of the Babadook so what do you do?  You learn to LIVE with it.  Just like all the sad and terrible things that we have to live with in our lives.

Overall, the film was good.  It didn't have any fancy effects or blood or any of the cheap jumps that many films have.  It felt gray and...heavy, I guess.  Like we were seeing Amelia's depression grow worse with each day.  And I think for me Babadook was most terrifying when he was saying his own name in that gravely voice.  ""Ba ba ba dook dook dook.""  There's something super creepy about that.

See it - it's definitely worth a watch.",1468022400,,3557,4.39908256880734
6702072,5,B00O20UHDO,"Monster in the closet?  Horror films are notoriously paranormal.  This film goes beyond that as a metaphor of trauma.  It is hard to make a proper review without spoiling the meaning behind this as I completely understand where it is coming from.  A young boy is unconventionally hyperactive, giving grievance to a mother who just wants to fit in and not end up as the parent of ""the problem child"" as she is completely alone around women who complain about the most mundane and petty things.  Her world is much more dark as she begins to be stalked by a past there is no escape from.

The Babadook does not go away.

Neither does reality; the subtle true horror of the film.

6702074,1,B00O20UHDO,"I love horror movies.
I have seen so many.
Maybe that is why I did not find this movie scary.
I thought that it was too slow and very boring.

CONTAINS  SPOILERS......

Obviously, by the end of this movie, you are supposed to believe that the Babadook is real and is living in the basement.
But I had a different interpretation of this movie.

I believe that the mother was mentally ill, from the very beginning.  Her husband died in a car accident while driving her to the hospital to give birth.  So, she is left alone to raise their baby.  The sudden loss of her husband was too much for her, and she went crazy.  So, she became afraid of everything, and she raised her son to be afraid of everything also.  He actually got his fear of monsters from her.  At six years old, he was sleeping with his mother, not only because he was afraid to be alone in the dark, but because she was.

Where did the book come from?  It looked like a homemade book.  I think that she made it herself and put it on the shelf for her son to find one day.  When she tore the pages and put it into the garbage, how did it reappear at her doorstep, taped together, with new drawings?  She taped it up herself, and she created the new pages.  Every time that she heard a noise, or saw something, or had a nightmare, it was her own mental illness.  She imagined phone calls, and holes in her kitchen wall, and bugs crawling everywhere, and seeing her dead husband, and creepy images on TV.  She kept rubbing the side of her cheek - - maybe she had some kind of a tumor in her head that caused her to hallucinate.

The scene where she actually yanked a tooth out of her mouth with her fingers was ridiculous.

The masturbation scene was unnecessary and didn't fit the rest of the movie.

It was also unnecessary to have her kill the dog by trying to strangle him and then breaking his neck.

None of these scenes were scary, they were just disgusting and weird.

The book said something about finding out what was underneath, but we never find out.

The little boy was extremely annoying.
The only good thing about him was when he finally went to sleep.
But she went too far when she cursed at him and finally attacked him.
The little boy was supposed to see a psychiatrist, but that never happened.  The mother definitely needed one also.

I think that all of the mother's actions were from a mental illness,
and all of the little boy's actions were from spending too much time alone with her so that he developed an anxiety disorder.

The ending was flat, and I was just glad that it was finally over.",1466121600,2,2580,4.287784679089027

6702098,5,B00O20UHDO,"WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS:

Directed by Australian born Jennifer Kent, The Babadook is a riveting psychological horror following the daily life of an Australian hospice worker, Amelia (Essie Davis), and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), as it is slowly transformed by the influence of a dark entity known as The Babadook.

Plagued by the violent loss of her husband to a car accident en-route to give birth to her son, Amelia's character is a shaken one from the start, and her son's atrocious behavior is far from helpful to her mental state. Being an inventive boy, and on obsessed with the childhood notion of the monster under the bed, Samuel takes it upon himself to craft several homebrew weapons ranging from crossbows to catapults to defend himself. However, rather than combating a monster, he inadvertently breaks a window in the house, causing his mother's already waned patience to grow even thinner. Additional to his destructive tendencies, Samuel is quickly shown to be a social outcast amongst his peers, as well excessively physically dependent on his mother, demanding countless readings of stories and repeatedly demanding to sleep in his mother's bed at the risk of a severe tantrum if his demands are not met. So the scene is set for the introduction of the monster, done artfully in the form of an illustrated pop-up book, as well as the first use of vibrant color so far, ""Mister Babadook.""
From hereon we follow the exponential decay of Amelia's sanity as the Babadook takes hold, as indicated by an increasingly sparse color palette, extreme point-of-view camera angles, and sharply contrasting use of light and dark. What is truly interesting about this film is in its depiction of the monster, or lack thereof. Barring short glimpses of aspects of the Babadook's physical form, such as wings in an otherwise void-like blackness, or a scuttling, vaguely humanoid, form on the ceiling, the Babadook is never truly seen. Rather, we see Amelia, as the insanity brought on by its presence takes her over, become the only true corporeal representation of the Babadook.
Sound, as much as camera work, plays a highly important role in painting the horrorscape of the film as well. As mentioned above, the Babadook is never really ""seen"", however it is often portrayed by a unique set of sounds. As the monster's presence grows near, we hear a deep bass frequency accented by the din of cicadas. The use of the cicada's sound is important for two reasons, as it is both an oppressive, all encompassing sound, as well as the hallmark of the insect itself, which is often used as a symbol of rebirth and personal change which is a strong forebear of the change Amelia undergoes come the end of the film.
Overall, between the camerawork, exceptionally human portrayal of emotion, and expert use of light and sound, The Babadook ranks in for me as one of my favourite horror movies I've seen so far, providing that perfect balance of suspense, tension, and fear, that so many horror movies strive to achieve but fall flat on. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a horror film with a bit more substance than the average jump-scare, and a story so immersive you'll find yourself unable to look away.",1462665600,,3216,4.888278388278389

The movie does a tremendous job of building suspense for the first half of the movie. and does not give any indication that it was made on a relatively modest budget.  However, once the creature is revealed and has extended screen time (relative to it's overall short appearance on screen), I felt like the tension was let out of the movie faster than air leaves a popped balloon.  Not to mentioned what I thought was pretty unimpressive canned monster screams that sound like they were sampled from a sixth-grade movie project (pretty minor complaint I suppose).  What I really didn't care for was the ending.  While I understand that this is really up to preference of the person seeing the movie, I thought it didn't fit well with the rest of the movie and ended up feeling out of place.  Yes, I understand that it is a metaphor, and I fully understand the implications, it just didn't seem to mesh well (once again my opinion).

6702151,5,B00O20UHDO,"Not as scary the second time around, but just as gripping to watch the protagonist descend into near madness. Good use of ambiguity - it is not clear (until the end) what is real and what is imagined. My brother claims the Babadook is an embodiment of her grief. Maybe. It works as a legitimate real evil monster as well. Nice twist at the end.

They should create a special category of Academy Award for the child actor in this movie: Most Annoying Child in a major motion picture. The effectiveness of this child's portrayal feeds the notion that the mother is being driven mad by him (and from sleep deprivation). The scene where he interrupts her ""private mommy time"" is classic. You can practically see the last vestiges of her libido shrivel up and flee.

Special mention to the kindly neighbor and the super-nice friend from work. They are a welcome respite of niceness in the face of despair and evil. In other films of this genre, these characters would end up as victims or surprise villains. They are neither. They are allowed to fulfill a more meaningful role.",1452124800,21,1072,4.636842105263158

This is one of a series (not an official series - just one I sort of made up as I went along) that strokes cultural consciousness anxieties about motherhood. And this particular set of anxieties is a doozy: ambivalent feelings about your child. Mothers are supposed to love completely and unconditionally, and most of us do. But it isn't always all that easy.

The Babadook sees that anxiety and raises you - slowly and deliberately trying your patience like a testing child - to full on terror. Not a lot of gore - but some genuine scares. This is psychological horror, not torture porn. The direction is amazing, and the acting shows it.

I loved this movie, but it will be a while before I re-watch it. Pretty sure that I want to own it, though. Solid 4 and a half stars.

If you care, the other ""mom"" horrors I've been watching are Inside (pregnancy, impending motherhood), The Taking of Deborah Logan (mother's impending death - dementia), Hungry Hearts (not really horror - maternal power issues), The House at the End of Time (transcendent maternal love), and for the master class in mommy issues, Dexter - the tv series.",1450915200,2,1181,4.668269230769231

I had read online and it is hit and miss with crowds because it is has a slow burn of classic horror movies, so younger generations who are seeking the immediate gratification of slasher or torture porn movies don't enjoy the more, I suppose, psychological horror of it. As I watched it, about half way to three fourths of the way through I realized that the Babadook was an allegory for mental illness, and I stand by that analysis. If I was in high school or college I would write a paper on it. :) There are all kinds of elements into which to look if that's your kind of thing, but if it isn't, it's a good movie to enjoy. I just liked having that frame of reference because I feel like it explains the conceptual limitations of a monster as well; if a monster also represents something, it explains stylistic decisions made.

It was so boring, un-scary, and down right tedious to watch.  For starters, the kid is literally so annoying, and I get that it is supposed to coincide with the character and whatnot, but he made me cringe in frustration.  Furthermore, whenever the two weren't outside of the house, the set was so dimly lit that I could hardly even tell what was on the screen.  Again, I know it's a horror movie, but I'd like to see what I am watching.  Finally, the whole story was just plain dumb - they never explain where the book comes from or why it does what it does - this family is just screwed.

6702203,4,B00O20UHDO,"I liked the film, it feels like a variant on Kubrick's Shining and I was almost expecting a Shining-type ending. I like that they made it different, but I do feel a critical scene doesn't quite work or is not quite convincing. The scene I am talking about is the confrontation between the Mom and the Babadook, she tell his it's her house and he should leave... when it's obvious that it is his house (the house is a masculine blue, in addition that it houses a shrine to it, plus the only reason the Babadook is there is that the kid and the Mom have both summoned it! The only reason the Babadook is there is that it is attempting to fill the void left by the missing Husband, Husband/Father and Father that neither the Mom or the kid can - even after seven years.)

A more Jungian approach (such as the embrace of  shadowy self - that would have worked fine, even if it is somewhat trite,) would probably have worked better, but even having the Mom beat or dominate by force or willpower the monster would have been acceptable. As it is she simply lies to it.

The little kid is a creep where it counts, and the Mom is cute, beautiful, ugly, scary and creepy at different times... I would not be surprised to learn her face was CG altered in different scenes, though I can't be sure of it.

The end can be interpreted from the fairly benign ""the Babadook is replacing a dead dog, it is a pet-like sort of thing that feeds from a pet dish,"" to a quite perverse and morbid ""the Babadook will be there when Mom is feeling frisky.""
It certainly depends on your own interpretation but I cannot help but feel that the second one is the one we're supposed to take home.",1446422400,,1665,4.292993630573249

6702219,2,B00O20UHDO,"I've always liked boogeyman stories, so naturally I was interested when I first heard of The Babadook. As a lover of horror I was hoping that I could actually find a movie that might creep me out, if not downright scare me. Having listened to the hype, I thought I was in for a treat. And indeed I was. There were chills and I even felt my skin crawl as this disturbing monster began to draw closer and closer to our main characters. As the lines between reality and nightmares blurred it reached such a point that real terror began to unfold as a mother toiled with the idea of killing her own child, all from the pressure put on by this horrible figment. I was loving the emotional drama as it built the tension, even moments where I thought the monster was being silly, the emotion of our main character would always bring out the real horror, the horror of a world gone mad. And again I would feel panic once the surreality dissipated under the raw emotion of horror.

I was enjoying this haunted house ride so much that I had easily forgiven the fact that the monster's claw fingers were a bit too reminding of Freddy Kruger. It wasn't until the very end that my enjoyment of a well paced, well acted, rather freaky horror film fizzled to bitter disappointment. The chicken out. The writer of this tale, had woven a masterpiece of symbolic archetypal horror, and forgotten at the very end to pull the trigger.

I like my horror movies to end with horror, call me old fashioned, but I need a hand to leap out of a grave, I need our main characters eyes to flash red as the reflection of the body of a spouse reveals itself, I need a preacher to pour a glass of bourbon and then light himself on fire just as we thought he vanquished the devil. The reason I want a horror story to linger with me or anyone else in the audience, is because that is what a horror movie should do. At first it should show you someone else's flaws and fears, and you watch as the chaos unfolds but at the very end, it's supposed to shock enough that you are left with questions about the horrors of the human condition. It should leave you shaking where your dreams have to sieve through the nightmares of your darker nature. Horror movies should challenge you. By having the character resolve the conflict in the most banal and childish of manners its cheats the audience of a chance to wrestle with their own demons. This movie had me freaked and didn't leave me freaked. I felt robbed.",1446249600,,2470,4.379084967320262
6702220,5,B00O20UHDO,"Excellent movie! If you like a good horror movie that gives you spine tingles and goosebumps then this is the movie for you. Horror movies aren't what they use to be...now they just focus on cheap jump scares and bloody gore. They have forgotten that some of the best horror movies out there don't resort to this mediocrity because they use the environment, sound, suspense, etc. to keep you thrilled and captivated. It's a shame this movie didn't do better in the box office...probably because America is brainwashed with crap like Saw and Paranormal Activity.

6702221,4,B00O20UHDO,"I think it's somewhat misleading to think of The Babadook as a horror film. While it relies on some of the standard conventions of horror films; i.e., mysterious locked doors, voices on the telephone, unexplained noises, etc., I think that it's really about the character played by Essie Davis, and how she goes from being driven almost insane by her difficult son to being driven insane by this thing he's dreamed up. Exactly what the Babadook stands for, I think, is open to interpretation, whether a projection of the guilt that she feels over her son, or perhaps even some sort of stand-in for her dead husband. But the strongest element of all in the film, in my opinion, is how difficult it is to know for sure if the thing that you're watching is actually happening, or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination.

In any case, The Babadook is definitely worth checking out. Highly recommended.",1446163200,,912,4.735849056603773

It was depressing and annoying. Watching the mother was like going into a room with all the air sucked out of it and people crying as they die. And watching the kid was like having somebody beat a hammer against your head for an hour. This movie did not give me the chills. It gave me a head ache. And the ending was so stupid.

I think people are giving this good reviews because of the cool looking monster and idea. The movie itself isn't good at all. The actress does a great job though, but still.

The movie is good at times but once the mother is possessed by the Babadook it takes a dark and horrible turn. Started out great. This odd spirit starts stalking the woman and her son after she reads a book she never bought. Tensions become high as she doesn't believe the thing exist but her son is obsessed with it.

After she is possessed she kills their dog, tells her son she wishes he was dead, she basically becomes a homicidal maniac. That ruined the movie, especially the killing of the dog. The dog scene lost it a star. Convinced she isn't his mom anymore he stabs and knocks out his and ties her up. It was all done in love though. Want to know what happens next? Well his love saves her of course. Or does it? After all you can't get rid of the Babadook. Or can you? The mother gets so pissed she actually scares the Babadook off. He'll hath no fury like a woman scorned. Like I said, you can't get rid of the Babadook. So what do you do? Keep it as a pet in the basement. This stupid ending lost it a star as well. Could have been five stars easily, but they didn't try hard enough.

6702231,4,B00O20UHDO,"The best thing about this movie is the performance by Essie Davis. Her performance ranges from sympathetic to deranged. Her character arc from despair to lunacy and back to health again is excellent. You might say she carries the whole movie on her shoulders.

Jennifer Kent's direction and script are studied and sincere. The obvious model here is Stephen King's The Shining. Kent has assimilated her influences so that the movie never seems like a rip-off. She also places emphasis on production design, especially lighting and textures. Even TV commercials use texture and color in very precise ways, but Kent is very tasteful in how she uses these tools to communicate her characters' emotions.

Despite the multitudinous blurbs about how nerve-frying and terrifying it is, The Babadook has more suspense than shout-out-loud scares. The focus really is on Essie Davis and her character's perilous journey back to mental health after her husband's gruesome and untimely death. If there's any horror, it comes from how Amelia's isolation takes her into dangerous areas of her psyche from which she may not be able to return. Thankfully, she makes it back, but Essie Davis will hold you in suspense just the same.",1445731200,2,1214,5.0954773869346734

The movie's a dud for me. The reviewers at rotten tomatoes (a site that is admittedly dubious with horror movie ratings in general) should be ashamed of the 98% that it currently holds. There's no way, given the number of people I've made suffer through this bore (also horror fans), that any collection of critics could seriously give this movie that high of a rating. A few poorly set up jump scares, bland characters, an insufferable child, an ending that is just nonsense, and sound effects that actually got me laughing!

Below is a sound byte borrowed from the film that may give you a chuckle:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4j1_n4zTVM

The high point of the film? That very well done pop up book, the only really creepy portion of the film. I wish they had given it a little more screen time. Another high note? The hope that some day rifftrax will get to this one and tear it apart like it deserves.",1444003200,4,1249,4.642533936651584

While it was not particularly all that scary, I have to say that it was the performance of the mother and child that made it work for me.

6702273,3,B00O20UHDO,"Cons: Very slow at the start and rather depressing from beginning to end. However, the viewer gets to understand why it is depressing by reading in-between the lines after the movie is done. I hate to write this, but in all honesty, the child was a terrible actor. It was excruciating to watch at a few points.
Pros: It was a very creepy movie. It did not fail to get us scared and on the edge of our seats once the movie was in sixth gear. The story behind the story is rather captivating (I allude to that just above, but I do not want to offer any spoilers). Essie Davis did a fantastic job in her role. It has some of the horror movie cliches but as a whole the firecracker is not a dud so-to-speak. In a sea of horror movie duds (especially in the last decade or so), this movie is far above that. Short and sweet. I would like to give it a 3.5 but reviewers do not have that option.",1443312000,4,888,4.08

6702345,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Bobadook is absolutely fantastic. It is one of those rare horror films that comes along once every few years or so that manages to not only startle, scare, and creep the viewer out of their skin, but does so in a masterfully artistic way without sacrificing intellectual substance. It is not really gory, nor is it full of so-called ""jump scares."" This is a subtle menace lying just below the surface or just on the periphery... But it always threatens to make itself plainly known.

The story is rather simple, but this allows the filmmakers to focus on affective filmmaking rather than having to focus on the intricacies of plot. What we have here, really, is a psychological character study. We follow the emotional and psychic draining of a single mother who is dealing with grief, anxiety, stress, etc. She has recently lost her husband and their only son is struggling - causing her to struggle, too. Enter a seemingly harmless children's book one night during their bedtime story ritual that turns out, of course, to be not-so-harmless. Now, it is a bit of a forced plot device, but psychologically it establishes an important point - that a seed in the mind can start small and grow and fester and eventually take over. She struggles against this ""dark other."" In the end... Well, why spoil it? The ending is brilliant and fits in perfectly with the gothic literary and film traditions and applies them to a very honest kind of reality that is very much alive today.

Side note: The film is Australian. The actors are Australian. If you have a hard time understanding dialects that you aren't used to, you may need to turn the subtitles on for a bit, at least, until your ear gets used to it. I didn't have any trouble, although I could see others struggling.",1438041600,,1771,4.673076923076923
6702346,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook is hands down one of the most frightening, psychologically disturbing films Ive ever seen.  This low-budget export from Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent pierces into dark territories of the human psyche that many films tend to avoid in order to deliver legitimate scares.

If you're looking for a horror film full of blood, guts, and jump scares, The Babadook is not for you.  Never once did I jump or avert my eyes from the screen, so if thats your idea of a scary movie youd best look somewhere else.  What I did see was a horror film that stuck with me days later and continues to haunt my imagination.

I could go on, but its best to view this film unspoiled.  Suffice to say, Im giving The Babadook my highest recommendation.",1438041600,,751,4.651515151515151

6702373,3,B00O20UHDO,"Single mom Amelia (Essie Davis) has a tough time raising her six year-old son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). The dad died on the way to the hospital for the birth and mom is still haunted by his memories. The son is a wreck too--he imagines monsters around every corner (not popular with other kids) and builds his own weapons (not popular with his mom or his school). If that all wasn't bad enough, one night he pulls a book off his shelf for his bedtime story. The book's title is ""Mister Babadook."" It's a gut wrenching pop-up book of a bogey man who is going to invade your home and do horrible things. The boy becomes obsessed with the Babadook, driving his mom even crazier. Is it all in their heads or is there really a malevolent presence making their miserable lives all that much more worse?

The movie is a smart horror film, relying on the two key components of a scary film. First, they follow the ""less is more"" style by having creepy things barely visible in pitch black corners. Using the viewers' imaginations against themselves always works well. Second, the sound design and editing boost the ""less is more"" style with creepy noises and voices. These twin tongs are good at jabbing the nerves of viewers. The atmosphere is very strong.

The actors are also very good. The boy is odd-looking and delivers a solid performance, treading the line between off-putting and sympathetic. The mom looks constantly disheveled (the movie was obviously not made in Hollywood) and her occasional breaks from being a nice mom are believable and terrifying.

The movie does a good job of leaving viewers guessing whether the Babadook is real or not and if the mom or the son is the crazy (or crazier) one. I found the set up a bit too depressing. Their lives were hard enough without layering on some more horror. The book is a catalyst that pushes them over the edge. I had a harder time sympathizing with both characters because I kept expecting one or the other of them to turn out to be the bad guy. The movie doesn't let the viewers of that easy, which makes it an intriguing movie to watch. The movie is definitely scary but wasn't as satisfying as I wanted it to be.",1436832000,,2169,4.542199488491049
6702374,4,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook really scared me. I do get easily freaked out, but sometimes in movies I am able to suppress my fears. Not so with this movie. Also, the amazing part was also that it doesn't utilize any ""jump scares."" Yes, it's hard to believe, but it's true. Of course, these are moments when suddenly the terrifying creature - in a horror movie - is suddenly thrust on screen in full view, prompted by a very loud noise. This kind of tactic is to be expected in a horror movie. However, jump scares happen in daily life as well. A loud noise - such as the fire alarm going off unexpectedly - can cause the same reaction. The Babadook doesn't do this. Instead, it creates a lot of tension. I would add that some of that tension was because I was expecting a jump scare that never came. However, there was still tension. The creature is scary looking. It appears in shadow form mostly. It never quite looks the same. In scene, it appears to have the face of a man but you can't tell.

The first appearance is from the so called children's book that it first appears in. It's a very scary pop up book with a macabre rhyming story. This is introduced early on and basically sets up the tension for the rest of the movie.

It's one of the better horror movies in recent time. I don't give it 5 stars because some of it was a little boring, despite the short running time.",1436832000,2,1365,4.286821705426356
6702375,5,B00O20UHDO,"I saw this movie on Netflix last night, oh boy! Besides the Babadook and a deceased spouse, I almost walk in Amelia's shoes!!! Before I become a parent, I never truly understand how much stress and workload, doing day-to-day mundane things with your child, living with sleep deprive life daily, is essential when you live with needy children! Our oldest son now is become a terribly whining, all-day-hyper, all-day-demanding, super destructive, and a very disobedient 3 years old boy. But everyone just told me ""that's just typical for a 3 year old!"", I really wonder that ""fact"" myself. I find it hard to believe!!! Because I've seen other people's 3 year old, and none of them behaved as badly as ours! Plus we just had twins 7 month ago. (Some people might questioning why we have more children? All I can say is, my oldest son was a sweet little angel before he turns 2 1/2 years old, and that was the end of it when I found out I was pregnant again! At the time he just entered his terrible two stage, and we still not seeing the light at the end of tunnel yet!) Since all of our families and friends living far-far away from us, we have no one but ourselves to deal with, so visually there's no relief for us, and we basically drained all our patience and energy just to deal with our oldest son, and that's terrible because you cannot exercise good parenting skill without patience and energy. My husband and I have been live in the ""survival mode"" on daily basis, for the last 1 and a 1/2 year, it's very similar to what Amelia has in this movie! Living like this has been very damage to our relationship with our sons, it's also been very damage to our relationship and marriage, too. When I saw this movie last night, I immediately feel the pain Amelia has, and our son almost turned out to be like Samuel, this is scary!

Possible SPOILER: Some people misunderstood the movie, the whole point of the movie is NOT about the shadowy figure being scary or not; the Babadook being is more of the symbolic/metaphoric figure of Amelia's own grief/depression/pain/lost-close-relatiosip/fear-of-death/lack-of-sleep/hidden-anger-towards-her-son/lingering-death-image-of-her-dead-husband ---- all roll into this one ""being"". Also mentioned in the movie, Amelia told other mother at the party she's a writer, hint that this Mr. Babadook picture book might just be her own work-of-art, written and created by her originally. Therefore this whole movie really is about her and her son facing her overdue ""emotional burden"" that became a ""physical being"" that she should deal with her emotion long ago! Once you understood the Babadook figure is her ""emotional demon"", just like anyone who has chronicle depression, you would understand this kind of psychological sickness would never go away completely, but you can fight back and get a little bit better ""one-day-at-the-time"", then you might be able to accept the ending with some sympathy towards Amelia.

This is a brilliant d&eacute;but by Jennifer Kent, powerfully done by the great acting job of both actor Essie Davis (Amelia) and Noah Wiseman (Samuel). There's no doubt Davis did the excel job playing Amelia. But I also think Wiseman did an excellent job playing Samuel, on the surface he looks ""bratty"" and ""needy"" because he have developmental problems (special needs) that no one understood, but the undertone Samuel always this soft, loving son who's longing and being protective toward his mother, a little boy who never have a dad, who also very afraid to lose his mom. I think people who like psychological type of film should check out this one. The rest of people who look for ghost, monster, gore, or jump-out-in-your-face type of horror movie, you can skip this one.",1436832000,,3734,4.897314375987362

Amelia ( Essie Davis) is a widow who is struggling at every point of her life. Parenting, working at her job are all issues that weigh her down easily. She had  lost her husband in a car crash when she was being taken to the hospital to deliver her son Sam ( Noah Wiseman). Sam is not a easy kid, he can be at times a real brat. He has issues and many of them are related to his parenting, and adjustment to school and family. Things are about to get worse when he discovers a creepy book called Babadook.
Jennifer Kent makes a great directing and writing  debut with her first film but there are a lot of loose ends,  we don't get to know much about the demon and we are also left grappling with a strange ending. You might understand it but I had to dig deeper on an internet forum.
All things apart including the cryptic ending, the movie is amazing because of the acting from the mother and son- especially the mother( Essie Davis). Her acting is just impressive as she demonstrates helplessness, exhaustion, anguish, ceaselessness and terror. She was simply phenomenal.

Amelia and Samuel are rarely invited to childrens parties, because he is so violent with the other children.

Each night, Amelia reads Samuel a bedtime story. One night, after allowing Samuel to choose the book, he chooses The Babadook. The premise of the childrens book is that once you know about this monster, the more he will plague you. The more you ignore him, the more difficult he is to get rid of. Of course, Amelia and Samuel have read the book, so there is no getting rid of the Babadook.

I love scary stories, but I did not find this one frightening. Too often, it seemed to miss its mark. It was very disjointed, leaving the audience to wonder what was actually happening at times. Some of the special effects were interesting, but then they feel short. I expected a lot from this movie, and it certainly failed to live up to my expectations.

Until one day, a children's book arrives mysteriously, and has lots of spoooooooky pictures and cryptic poetics about some guy in a trench coat. The mom starts to lose it, and the more she loses it, the more the trench coat guy pokes at her. But as she loses it, the son becomes less annoying, so pretty soon you're hoping he will ""accidentally"" push her down the stairs. But he puts up with her, bless him.

6702411,3,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook is a great horror movie that is ruined by a terrible ending.

A mother is still haunted by grief after losing her husband 6 years previous. She has a son that has behavior problems that are only accelerated by her terrible parenting. She obviously just walks through life missing her husband while letting her son walk all over her. He never experiences discipline and runs amok around the house and in the outside world.

The child, like most children, is afraid of monsters and he builds weapons to defend himself from these fabrications. The mother is such a zombie that she lets him build these weapons and doesn't realize he brings them to school. The child becomes so disturbed that even his aunt hates being around him.

The child becomes so bad that he is held out of school and thus begins the haunting. This movie was so well paced and made sure to develop the characters before bombarding the viewer with cheap scares. The Babadook book appears and the mother reads it to the child and what results is a haunting from a creepy abborition in a top hat. Eventually the mother lets it in and the creature possesses her. The mother becomes mad and violent and even scares her child into being normal. The movie was cruising along well until the end.

I think the writer ran out of ideas. She pukes out the Babadook, yells at it and then keeps it as a pet? What an anticlimactic ending.",1435622400,,1405,4.541501976284585

6702430,4,B00O20UHDO,"no spoilers:

This movie did a few things incredibly well, I don't think I've ever been so uncomfortable while watching a movie. But I can easily see how people would have wildly different experiences of it. I watched it alone, with a surround sound headset on, in the dark: best way to experience horror anything. The sound of this movie is the best thing about it, I was so creeped out I legitimately had to build a pillow wall behind me just to get rid of the feeling that something was climbing up my neck and into my ears. If you have a phobia of bugs, or things that skitter - do not watch this movie, you may have a panic attack.

But there are definitely downsides:

The acting is poor, what can you expect out of child actors. I can see how this would ruin the experience if you're prone to making fun of bad acting with your friends, etc. The story-line is a little thread bare, premise of the story and the audiences introduction to the ""lore"" (i guess you'd call it) is very well done, but we have virtually no characters or character development, let alone a cohesive story beyond ""creepy sh*t's been happening here.""

Final Verdict:

If you can get around a few misgivings and legitimately try to immerse yourself into the movie, preferable alone and in the dark - you will need new pants. But if you're someone looking to put another notch in your manliness belt, don't bother - it's not that kind of horror",1435017600,,1422,4.432950191570881

6702437,4,B00O20UHDO,"The title of my review (borrowed from a bonus feature interview on the disc) - in fact sums up the action in this movie brilliantly. The monster starts as something definitely apart - something that might creep out of a closet, or rap under the floorboards. But then its spirit seems to inhabit the mother and turn her into the beast itself.

This movie becomes a tour de force performance illustrating a descent into madness. In that respect, it might remind viewers of such cult classics as Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion."" But is that what this movie is really about? Or is there perhaps a real monster who haunts the premises?

The people who produced this movie don't spoon feed any answer to viewers. We are left to decide for ourselves. The plot does provide some clues though. Where did that pop-up book that introduces the progressively more menacing Mr. Babadook come from? Why can Mr. Babadook penetrate into some rooms, yet be confined in others? Is the Babadook real, with an independent existence, or is he in the mind - or both? While the movie draws us into that question, it delivers some very scary moments and that chilling central performance by Essie Davis.

The interview bonus features on the disc are also more absorbing than what's usually found on disc ""extras."" It seems it was primarily women who were involved in the making of this movie, and in telling about their journey getting this film as a realized project on screen, they weave a quiet, focused narrative that, in its way, is as atmospheric and intelligent as the movie itself.",1434585600,,1561,4.752767527675276

6702449,4,B00O20UHDO,"Many contemporary horror movies are considered to be nothing but trash, whether slickly produced or otherwise. On the other hand, Ive heard that last years The Babadook is actually a really good one. I never got a chance to see that in a theater, but I did stream it some time ago while babysitting the dogs.

A widowed mother tries to deal with her little sons emotional problems as he is haunted by nightmares of a monster stalking him. Things only get worse after she reads a rather creepy picture-book to him; his behavior becomes even more erratic and vehement. Over a series of manifestations, the title character of the book (and this picture in turn) turns out to be too real.

The cinematography is mostly spartan but still sharp, highly professional, and highly effective. The harshly contrasted lighting and deep shadows paint scary imagery. The special effects are likewise simplistic yet employed brilliantly.

The movie patiently builds up atmosphere and tone. The payoff is truly earned. When the picture-book takes on an outright sinister appearance, youll definitely know that something is seriously wrong! The scenes in which the Babadook appears can be truly unnerving. The plot eventually takes an utterly chilling turn late in the movie.

Ultimately, this is not a simple haunted-house yarn but rather a psychological drama. It is a tale of grief and fear. The horror is both mental and spiritual. The mix of the psychological and the supernatural is a potent one. The actress playing the widow does really well and does much to carry this picture. If this is what a quality psychological horror picture looks like, then I want to see more and I welcome any suggestions along the same lines that you pass on to me.",1434240000,,1735,4.891156462585034

6702458,4,B00O20UHDO,"There has been a lot of hype around this movie and it's clear that the waiting is worth it. Except for one little thing...

With the loss of her husband seven yeas ago, Amelia is barely just coping. She can't sleep, going through the motions and she can't handle her son, Samuel, whose hysterics and violent tendencies are driving her crazy. When a book called Mr. Babadook mysteriously appears, it seems like a harmless children's story but one that instinctively terrifies Amelia. As Samuel fully embraces the existence of the monster, Amelia becomes more and more determined to reject it...but at great loss, or perhaps gain, by ignoring the monster in the closet alongside Samuel, or risk ignoring it with even more dire consequences.

In some aspects, this whole movie is a metaphor for Amelia's inability to move on past her husband's death, and deal with her life and the responsibilities that she has as well as her son's witnessing to her breakdown and his reaction to her frailty. But there also seems to be a dark presence that is causing genuine terror experience for both Amelia and Samuel. Is this a psychological thriller dressed as a horror movie, or just a psychological horror movie? It's hard to say because you never really get to know for certain if it's Amelia completely losing it and witnessed through the eyes of Samuel, or if Mr. Babadook is real and truly trying to take possession of his mother and do them both harm. It keeps you guessing and without Essie Davis' brilliant portrayal of a grief-stricken and haunted widow, this would have been another seen it, over it. The use of a children's book as a source of distress and fear isn't new but the WAY it's done in this movie is brilliant. Mr. Babadook as a pop up book makes you uncomfortable at its sinister presentation. Here, it's used to increase Amelia's anxiety, which is absolutely insidious. Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is unexpected and like Amelia's character, never gong to the predictable. He is, throughout, graphically ANNOYING. At times I almost wish the Babadook would just take him so he'd stop being so obnoxious and the first half of the movie was a bit torturous until it got better and started making more sense. You just don't quite know what to think of Samuel. Is he deranged, or the demon, or the savior? Or is Amelia? Or are they both? The ending isn't what it seems, because you think you know how it'll go, but it's not what you thought, which makes The Babadook truly creepy. You are left unsure if there really is a monster or if both mother and son have embraced their inner turmoils and given it a name and body, for the sake of sanity and happiness.

There are lot visual elements that were superbly done. Light and shadow, muted colors, the use of form and shapes, of not doing too much with the CGI but keeping it more organic with classic horror tricks. The guttural sounds of the Babadook and its habitation with in Amelia was simple but effective. I liked the subtle details that enhanced the unearthly factor, like when Amelia has insomnia, she oftentimes be flipping through channels, of weird black and white or old clips that add another undertone to Amelia's inner transformation.

The whole movie was scripted smartly and the acting by all was well done. It had all the right ingredients, not too much of this or not enough of that and well placed jump in your seat moments. The creation of Mr. Babadook is what sold it for me. It's clever, creep-tactic, intelligently crafted and original; there was a real thought to the development and is a character within the movie as well as within the book. I also liked the interplay of the mother-son dynamic but I have to say, Samuel's character got on my nerves to the point I almost stopped watching it after 40 min of his screeching tantrums and Amelia's complete lack of parental control. HOWEVER, as the story unfolds, Samuel gets less annoying and more tolerable.

6702460,5,B00O20UHDO,"WARNING:SPOILERS

Let's get one thing straight: it's not a horror movie.

Well, not in the conventional terms. This is a movie about mental illness. There are a lot of key elements in the movie pointing to this. I think where some people are confused is they are taking the storyline literally but it's from the perspective of someone with a very skewed rationale.

This is a story about an unresolved grief that spirals for years out of control. We are catching it at the very peak. There is no Babadook, it is a manifestation of the internal conflict that Amelia has kept locked away for years that finally breaks through her defences.

Let's start with the name: Babadook. It's an anagram of ""a bad book"". And where did it come from? Amelia made it. She writes children's books. She has periods of forgetfulness, blackouts that last for hours and the occasional emergence of a violent personality unlike her own. Perhaps she thinks that if she can somehow physicalise the pain and terror she is feeling it can be locked away or at the very least, out of her.

One of the things I think people find misleading is there is no step-by-step narrative to the whole story. Everything is portrayed from the fractured perception of Amelia. The theme of the movie is centred around the symptoms of bipolar and the incomprehensible ""hypersensitivity"" that can produce. The unnatural sounds, creeping shadows and finally the appearance of the Babadook are all in her head. Even the scene towards the end with her son being dragged up the stairs and thrown against the wall has nothing to do with the Babadook. It's her. But she is so aghast at such an act that she imagines some supernatural force doing that to her son.

I could go on about a lot of other aspects of the movie but I would rather not give too much away. Needless to say, I don't think Jennifer Kent ever meant for the movie to be marketed as a horror. But let's face it, for a first time director that side of the business was most likely out of her control.

For those that were non-plussed about the movie I urge you to watch it again. Do some research about bipolar. I think you will find it is one of the most accurate movies about it ever made.",1433808000,2,2208,4.518796992481203

Although it's uneven, especially in it's characterization of the principals (in some scenes the boy wears an expression that would have me wrapping him in a straight-jacket; in other he just looks like a scared sweet kid and the mom similarly veers back and forth between murderous rage and exhausted helplessness) it works on at least two levels.  It's a solid horror story on suspense while light on gore and jump cut gimmicks.  It's also a story of life spinning out of control as mother and son desperately grapple with the effects of tragedy.  The film isn't quite good enough to pull off the combination of themes completely, but it comes close enough to be more than worth a watch.

It's not the scariest movie ever made--you'll be disappointed if you expect that--but you may find yourself leaving a nightlight on in the bedroom for a while.  And the ending--well, it's weird (actually, once I got it, I thought it was a good laugh)!",1433721600,,1155,4.665024630541872

6702474,4,B00O20UHDO,"I enjoyed this movie, though I would classify it as ""terror"" or ""thriller"" more than ""horror"".  It's a psychological thriller with a big heap of symbolism, so people who like their scary movies to be straightforward will probably be disappointed.  It isn't gory, but it is gruesome at times (poor doggie!).  It succeeds on being creepy and the ending is peculiar, at least until you think it over and realize what it meant.  One nice thing is that this movie ends with ""The End."" (period) and not ""The End?"" (question mark).  In other words, there is actually resolution in the end, which means you can sleep after being creeped out by this one.

It's not a fantastic movie, but it's extremely good, especially for the first movie for this writer/director, and it does push the boundaries of the genre.  If you like brainy movies, and being creeped out, but not being left unsettled in the end, then you probably will enjoy this movie a lot, but if you like your scary movies to be simple and gory with a classic villain/demon/monster then you may not like this very much at all.",1433376000,,1079,4.617801047120419

6702476,5,B00O20UHDO,"The thing that you have to understand about the Babadook to really understand the movie, is that the monster and many aspects of the story are mostly metaphorical. This is not your typical horror movie. What the Babadook represents is a psychological concept called the shadow self, or ""shadow aspect.""

The shadow self is the darker parts of our personalities that many of us like to pretend doesn't exist. In the case of this movie it manifests in a mother's desire to kill her problem child. Ignoring the shadow self doesn't make it go away, as repeatedly said in the movie, ""you can't get rid of the Babadook."" The only way to deal with the shadow self is to face it, and acknowledge it's there, hence the end of the movie.

This movie is terrifying in both its exploration of the darker aspects of the human psyche, and with how terrible it can be to lose a loved one and be stuck raising a difficult child.",1433203200,7,912,4.4879518072289155

Something like The Conjuring, is far more frightening and sticks in the brain with far deeper daggers (consider the scene with the sheet over Lily Taylor's head). But I got to thinking why was this so hyped up. Well consider the sources, mostly mainstream media. This film fits neatly with a certain species of gender politics (not so much in the film as in the reviews), pop psychology, postmodern irresolution, and fear of children. It's not all that scary if you don't have any obvious gender points to prove, if you have a stronger handle on your emotions, if you believe in good and evil or don't find children all that upsetting. The film is well acted and has it's moments. I'll definitely re-watch it again once the hype has settled a bit.

This isn't the ridiculous, unimaginative and derivative horror that has filled our cinemas since The Texas Chainsaw remake and the coming of Saw. This is actually quite mature, imaginative and beautifully realized horror, focusing on parenting with an insight that James Wan and the other deeply immature directors of his generation will never be able to manage in their lifetime. Although sharing the genre conventions of these less talented filmmakers works, this feels closer to Polanski, or Lynne Ramsey's We Need to Talk About Kevin (most definitely a modern day horror film). So the one stars are from people who don't have any grasp of reality - the typical horror geeks who can't appreciate anything other than the same film made over and over again (they're kind of like AC/DC fans).

6702518,4,B00O20UHDO,"""The Babadook""(2014) was directed by Jennifer Kent. This psychological horror story is about a phantom that haunts a young boy and his mother.
The husband died when the mother was being rushed to the hospital to give birth to the boy and so the boy is never allowed to celebrate his birthday since it was also the same day as his father's death. The film's horror stems from the mother and child's grief and how they each try to come to terms with it.

The blu-ray is beautiful with its high definition and clarity as well as its cool palette of colours. Originally the director considered filming in black and white for the dramatic effect as well as a homage to past directors like Georges Melies, and Jean Epstein, and films like Vampyr and Haxan.

I had never heard of this movie before seeing it on Netflix. Both the mother and the child are ultra annoying - the kid is screaming throughout most of the movie.

I kept wanting to shut it off, but hoped there would be some kind of twist or something to make the hour I already had into it worthwhile.

6702535,5,B00O20UHDO,"Movie Review: The Babadook (2014)
In this day and age of torture porn and senseless sex, blood and violence, many of the newer generation are so numbed out and not used to the intensity of true psychological horror. The thing that makes psychological horror films so great is the slow burn. Slow burns consist of a few things, atmosphere, a great story, and always a epic twist at the end. Those three things alone will trump over any blood and guts film.
The mind itself is far more terrifying than in your face visceral carnage.
Last year it was OCULUS (which can be read here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388715/reviews-285).
This year...The Babadook is THAT film.
The Babadook is the directorial debut of actress turned director, Jen Kent. The film itself is based on a short film entitled: ""Monster"" which won rave reviews in the short film festival circuit. This film has lots of mixed reviews which I believe stems from the lack of knowledge of older films and imagination to boot. The Babadook is a anagram of a bad book, and interesting enough a Serbian word babaroga which means boogeyman.
The film starts out with Amelia (played by Aussie actress Essie Davis) involved in a car crash which took the life of her husband. The film then cuts to 7 years later where we are introduced to her son 7 year old Samuel (played with perfection by Noah Wiseman). Samuel has a bit of behavioral problems. These problems are both in school as well as in his social and family life. His mother's health and mental stability hasn't been the same since the accident, which causes a huge gap between him and his mum.
The 30 minute mark is when we finally are introduced to MISTER BABADOOK. The 45 minute is when things start to get uncomfortable. The hour mark is when it gets intense, scary, and really exercises your intellect.
The ending itself, is quite open to interpretation.
The actual entity known as Mister Babadook, takes play from the silent black & white films. The film was originally intended to be filmed in B&W, but the crew found perfect colour palettes which accommodated their needs for the setting and mood of the film.
The first half of the film allows you to relate and feel for both Amelia and Samuel. In a way, the film is about love. It doesn't shy away from that vibe, even when things start to take a turn for the worst. The film itself has a lot of in your face situations that mothers and people who have suffered a devastating loss can relate to.
The film has a slow burn style. It also has Polanski as well as German expressionism overtones throughout. The film seems to be set in a reality styled setting but with just enough darkness and mood to make it surreal almost.
The young actor who plays Samuel really makes the show. This 6 year old is utterly amazing!! The pop up book itself is another actor in the film that truly makes your skin crawl. The book really sets the mood for what's to come. Aussie actress Essie Davis' performance rivals Shelley Duvall's in The Shining.
This is a film that demands multiple viewings....do yourself a favor and let MISTER BABADOOK DOOK DOOK in your lives.",1431993600,5,3123,4.6389891696750905

6702539,5,B00O20UHDO,"Fantastic psychological horror that bucks the recent trend of entertaining the mindless masses. This is truly a thinking-person's movie. Out of 4 people that watched this movie in my house, I was the only one that understood its meaning and significance. A short attention-span viewer will not understand the ending at all, and curse this film. In essence, this film gives us a terrifying view of life's real monsters; depression, paranoia, and being mentally overwhelmed. The writer/director did an excellent job of making us question whether the Babadook was real or imagined, but towards the end, there was no doubt. A grieving widow subconsciously blames her son for her husband's untimely death. Life's events snowball frustration and trigger her inner depression to tumble into the depths of insanity. She in turn, feeds her confused son's over-zealous imagination, to create the Babadook. The Babadook wears the dead husband's cloths and symbolizes with haunting effect what grief can truly do. Once you let it in, ""you cant get rid of the babadook"" (a manifestation of her free-fall into psychosis) , so she locks it up in the basement (where all of the dead husband's belongings are stored) and feeds it once a year (day her husband died / son was born), so she can cope with normal living for the rest of the year. The name ""BABADOOK"" is an anagram of the phrase ""A BAD BOOK"". I bet I could watch this movie numerous times and find other important symbolism that I missed.

6702571,3,B00O20UHDO,"I had heard some good things about this movie, so I decided to check it out. The story involves a widow that is struggling with the loss of her husband, as well as a child that is suffering from some troubling behavioral issues. When a mysterious and disturbing children's book ""Mr. Babadook"" is found and partially read as a bedtime story, things start to get even worse.  Weird sounds, strange voices, shadowing figures...is the Badadook real or just a woman slowly falling into insanity? Being a fairly low budget film, it has a pretty good production and is well made. The effects of the""Babadook"" are minimal, using sounds, light and shadow effects, but its still done pretty well. Sometimes the less you see, the more effective it is, and I think it works here. The acting is strong, including a pretty effective performance from the main protagonist, Amelia (played by Essie Davis). I will admit that the character of Sam, the child, does get annoying at times. I feel that its not because of the actor, but rather how the character is written and supposed to be portrayed.  The film is rather a slow burner though. There's not a ton happening, but there is some rather cool moments here and there. I do feel however, that the ending is a bit of a letdown. SPOILER ALERT! ***I don't quite understand how the Badadock was stopped/captured. Perhaps its the whole ""face your fear and it takes away it's power"" scenario. And if its some supernatural thing, why do they need to feed it and choose to keep it in the basement?? Oh well..I'm thinking there will be a sequel sooner or later. And if I'm going to picky, the sequence where a 6 year old boy get the best of his mother in by doing his best Macaulay Culkin Home Alone impression is a bit silly. ***But all in all, this is a pretty decent flick. It certainly isn't groundbreaking or overly memorable, and its in the same vein as films like Boogeyman, Sinister, Insidious, Conjuring, etc. but it still holds it own. I would say the 15 dollar price tag is a bit steep, but the special edition packaging here looks awesome so it might be worth it.

6702573,2,B00O20UHDO,"Bought this movie after seeing it mentioned on a bunch of forums and watching the trailer. I must say, I was horribly disappointed. This movie is not so much about a monster called the Babadook, as it is about a monster in the form of a single mother on the brink and her troubled child.  You will watch the film, and early on will hate the child because of what a brat he is. And then you will feel bad for him, as his behavior mellows out and is overshadowed by the psychotic behavior of his negligent mother. The role of the Babadook is small, almost second hand, to the antics of the other two.

About halfway into the movie, I felt as if I had already invested about 45 minutes of my life to this movie so I should finish it.

6702585,3,B00O20UHDO,"Interesting small film. In a setting so tight as to be claustrophobic, so dark as to seem in permanent twilight, the story opens. Widowed mom Amelia is raising her precocious high-strung son, Samuel, by herself. Hanging on by a thread, Amelia's grasp on reality is tested even further. Having lost her husband in a car accident enroute to the hospital to give birth to her son, (her son's birthday is the anniversary of her husband's demise), emotions run high. Samuel sees monsters under the bed and in his closet, and builds weapons to protect mom, his only surviving parent. One night a new book, The Babadook, appears on the bedtime story bookshelf. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Babadook himself shows up. Circumstances go downhill quickly thereafter for our little family.
  No spoilers here.  Explorations of grief are usually intense, more so in an intimate setting. Despite an ultimately (for me) unsatisfying ending, the Babadook succeeds at getting inside the relationship between mother, son, and community, and showing what happens when something impossible to plan for steps into the mix. Despite its flaws, worth watching. Good acting, intriguing story.

It also offers viewers a chance to actually think about the deeper layers the story holds.  ** The true beauty of this film is that it is actually a metaphor for loss --- of the toll it takes on those left behind, and of not knowing if the pain can ever be overcome. **

It isn't the knock in the deep, dark night. It isn't the sudden fright. Nor is it a scene of grotesqueness. No, it's something far scarier than any of this stuff, all of which is artificial and concocted. Rather, it is the fear and loss lurking inside all of us. And even more, it's about our ability to face and manage our greatest fears and losses, either in a healthy way, or, short of that, otherwise. The Babadook tells the story of the otherwise.

The setting is Australia, but it could be anywhere, even your hometown. Amelia Vannick is trying to put her life in order six years after the death of her husband Oskar. They were in an auto accident on the way to the hospital to deliver Samuel. It's Samuel who seems to be exhibiting the worst effects of Oskar's death, the loss of a father he never knew. And he senses in his childlike way just how much pain the death has caused his mother. He constantly assures her that he will protect her and has devised a weapon that catapults a ball at evildoers to make good on his promise. However, he's an unsettled boy who suffers from a fairly common childhood fear, not just of monsters in the night, but of abandonment. His insecurities and fears manifest as unruly and, occasionally, dangerous behavior, as with an incident in school and with his cousin at her birthday party. As you can see, the film plays on some deep psychological issues.

One evening, they discover in their house a book that has passed their notice titled Mr. Babadook. While it looks like a children's book, the black and white artwork and the scenes of mutilation and, especially, those of a family like the Vannick's in the throes of self destruction mark it as anything but. The art here is absolutely spooky,while at the same time brilliantly mesmerizing, and translated into film action with haunting effect.

From here on in, Samuel lives in a state of stark terror as Amelia degenerates into lunacy. Oskar appears to her. She kills her beloved dog. She nearly kills her son. She battles the Babadook. In the end, she resolves her conflict and finds a sort of peace that most will agree is anything but normal and will find very disturbing.

There are no cheap jump scares, it is all pure emotional terror. This may be a horror film that doesn't target the mainstream horror audience.

6702611,4,B00O20UHDO,"THE BABADOOK COULD GET ANY ONE OF US AT ANY TIME
The special packaging edition from Shout! has a facsimile of the book a single mother, Amelia Vannick (Essie Davis) reads to her 6-year son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) which opens up from its Dragonflame plush-red covers to a pop-up figure of the shadowy monster, Babadook.

One should not think that The Babadook is a thrill-ride horror film, even though such familiar sequences from the genre occur during the beginning.
Director Jennifer Kent has said that this is a film about the trials of a single-mother and the demands that are made daily on her, and the denials she imposes on herself.  The film is that.  But I see it as more than just about parents and children, though they are the principles that endure what terrifies any thinking adult.
This is about Depression.
This is not about having the Blues.
This is about a portrait of despair.  The lighting and texture of the filming continually defines that.  The disturbing music and imagery re-enforce that sustained atmosphere.
Having seen too much of the effects Depression can have on people I love, how devastating it can be on a daily basis, for the individual suffering the debilitating disease that many people don't understand, and believe it can be cured if people just pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

Would the same people say the same things or harbor the same thoughts for someone who has had a heart attack or a stroke or Cancer?
Only the most callous of individuals would, those without any compassion for other human beings than themselves.
Essie Davis has a demanding role to play as the mother who is a care-taker not only to a son who is difficult to handle to the outside world and to her, but also as a nurse in an Nursing home for the elderly and invalids.

Critics have been saying this is a really scary & disturbing film so I had to check it out for myself.  There are some creepy scenes in the film and a great idea for the mythos of the real or not real monster, but it just didn't live up to the hype for me.

This is not a monster film hardly at all.  The Babadook is mainly a manifestation of the mother character's decent into a mental breakdown while dealing with grief and an emotionally unstable child.  That is what this film is primarily about and less a supernatural monster thriller, which is what I wanted and expected it to be.  They do later establish that the Babadook is real but it comes too little to late in the film.  Not a horrible film, but a very missleading one.",1430611200,4,877,4.278787878787878

How in the world people are saying this is the scariest film in years must have seen a better edited cut of the film then what I saw.
2nd place, Iv seen reviews that claim this film is a metaphor for child abuse and grief within family's. Iv seen reviews that claim the Babadook was just in the mind of the woman and she was just suffering from schizophrenia or some other psychosis. I might agree with this if we hadn't seen the mother float across her sons room or seen the kid grabbed half a dozen times by a invisible force and flung around like a rag doll. Or how about the end when she sets the plate of worms down and it slides across the room into darkness at a growling Babadook. I'm sorry but these supernatural events did happen and were firmly established by the visuals, therefore the Babadook was a real entity/monster. I can't understand how it could be interpreted any other way.
If you like your horror films without horror and little kids that scream and throw tantrums for a good portion of the film, then you'll love this. Otherwise don't waste your time or money.
Forgot to add that a few people seem to think the Babadook was the dead father. Really? So the father dies in a car crash and comes back to terrorize his wife and daughter as a monster in a book. He must have really hated them!!",1430524800,2,1464,4.346715328467154

It does have a few creepy scenes sprinkled thru out the film but its way to slow for my taste. I also hear a few people say the sound was off & I agree.

6702638,3,B00O20UHDO,"For the last couple of months, a lot of my friends wouldnt shut up about The Babadook. When I first read short plot summaries of it, it sounded pretty interesting, but with how my friends and many people online were praising it, I couldn't help but feel like I was going to watch it and end up disappointed. Granted, I never go into a movie with high expectations anymore (that ended when the first Alien vs Predator came out), and I never watch a movie wanting to not like it either. I finally watched The Babadook recently and as you can see by my rating, I didn't hate it. I didn't think it was anything great by any means, but it wasn't terrible. The thing is, this is yet another horror movie that Ive already seen bits and pieces of in other films or books, so nothing here really surprised me at all. From what the monster really is to the build up, if youve seen a good amount of horror or psychological thriller films, youve already seen a good portion of this one.

Amelia is a single mother living with her young son, Samuel. Her husband died in a car accident on the day Samuel was born, and shes hard a pretty rough life since then. She still wears her wedding ring, has all of her husbands stuff in the basement, and while shes tried to not bring him up or think much about him, the second hes mentioned by someone else, she gets on their case about it. She works in a nursing home while Samuels in school, where he isn't liked by the students or faculty. Even parents who are into the whole time out thing would tell Amelia to make him go cut a branch from the nearest tree and bring it back so she could proceed with the whipping. At home, hes pretty unruly, creating (admittedly cool) weapons and traps that would make Kevin from Home Alone proud. Things take a turn for the worse-er when Samuel picks a mysterious book off his shelf for his bedtime story- Mister Babadook. It features black and white drawings of a sinister looking figure in a cape and top hat, with big white eyes looking over a child in their room. Amelia doesnt even finish the story when she reads ahead to herself and sees what all happens. She puts the book away, but Sam changes drastically, and thinks the Babadook is coming for him. He becomes more violent, even pushing a little girl out of a tree house, and throws fits in the car while Amelias driving. Its taking a toll on the poor woman- you can see her health dwindling as a result of the lack of sleep and stress. Then she starts to hear strange voices. The Babadook couldn't be real, could it?

The best thing they did in The Babadook was establish how bad Amelia has it. She lives in a pretty depressing home that looks like no ones been in it for years, doesnt have any friends, her one family member she talks to doesnt want to be around her son and never comes over, theres a good guy at work who obviously has a crush on her but she doesnt show any interest even when he comes to visit her sick son, and she never bothers to try and get Samuel under control. If you were to record these same scenes with a regular camera, you could send the footage in to some talk show and for sure get on to talk about your out of control kidthen get some million dollar home made for you or something. I genuinely felt bad for Amelia and there were times when I wished I could reach into the screen and give her a hug or a few bucks. Essie Davis nailed it here, and while it may not have pushed her acting skills to their limit, she definitely deserves recognition for her portrayal of Amelia. Noah Wiseman does very well as Samuel, being bratty enough to the point where you know youve seen kids just like this somewhere, usually in a store making a fuss over not getting what they want and acting like they're having a mid-life crisis. The movie doesnt have much in the way of supporting roles- just a couple of people who pop in for a few minutes and take off, so we get plenty of time learning about Amelia and her son.

Where the movie started to lose me though, was with the Babadook itself. Im going to give you a little warning here- Im going to spoil a good amount in this section of my review, so skip to the next part if you care. Then again, most people who read reviews  are, for some reason, people whove already dealt with the product and like reading other reviews for some weird reason. Ok, heres the spoiler part:

Anyone hoping to see this thing is going to be very disappointed. If you saw the Godzilla reboot last year, you know that if you wanted to watch it just to see Godzilla, all you had to see was the last 20 minutes of the movie. You see more of Godzilla there than you ever do of the Babadook here. Heck, you see more of it in the story book than you do when it materializes, and even then, its hidden in the shadows. Why even tease it when it never shows itself? With how the Babadook looks in the book, I was very interested to see what they were going to do with its appearance as a real thing. Its pretty underwhelming when the Babadook starts to terrorize Amelia and Samuel more and more, because it already gave everything away in the story book. And yes, I DO GET what the Babadook is supposed to be. Its essentially Amelias grief/depression that started to build up when her husband died- just pay attention to the words in the story when she reads it, and it should click right away. Its also the hate she has for her son, that becomes pretty clear when he tells her that he loves her and she simply replies with me too.  And how she defeats itwhy does it retreat when she yells at it? The films ending was what knocked it down from 4 stars to 3.

End spoiler part.

Ill go ahead and say that The Babadook is worth watching once. Its only and hour and a half, moves a long fairly fast, and the dramatic parts between mother and son are very good. Just don't go into it thinking its much of a horror film, and you may end up liking it.",1430352000,,5917,4.234720992028343

So I'm going to use my time to go on about the sound mix. The DTS-HD 5.1 track is one of the best I've heard. Such an amazing sound mix. If you don't have surround, they even included a studio-mixed stereo track that you can choose. I definitely recommend doing this over letting your player convert the surround into stereo (on any movie that offers this) if you are using a stereo sound setup. Things that actually use surround well usually have issues when your player converts them to stereo on-the-fly, so it has a good sound mix for everyone. I highly recommend the surround track, which it defaults to, if you have the setup for it.",1430179200,2,761,4.442857142857143

The sound level was horrible, the child needed to be shot and this movie did not scare me once. The show had a good sense of buildup right throughout but it just never materialized into anything. A fitting ending would be to kill the little boy because for all of his antics at the start of the show he deserved to die at the hands of the mother. (preferrably if she could choke him to death or cover his face with a pillow). The mother should have taken her life also similarly to how the Babadook story book intended her die. This movie is not really worth the time and I would definitely suggest a rental before purchasing.

This is a gem that didn't need jump scares to give you more then a few sleepless nights. Yes, there are no jump scares, CGI, or dumb teenagers, here. Instead we have an original plot, an intense claustrophobic atmosphere, amazing performances, and the scariest monster I have seen in a long time. It's not just it's design or the way it was handled, but what it represents and what it can do is truly horrifying when you think about it.

The Babadook deserves every amount of praise it is getting, but it is not for everyone, mainly anxious teens, nor is it a perfect film. The mother's son, Samuel is indeed very annoying in the first half of the movie, and will get under people's nerves. There is also the ending, I will not spoil what happens, and while I think it was brilliant, I see why many were disappointed with this finale.

6702659,4,B00O20UHDO,"Relentlessly creepy study of a woman's descent into madness- or is it imaginary madness?  The Babadook is a well made, if somewhat clumsy supernatural horror flick with some excellent acting and unexpectedly subtle directing by Jennifer Kent.  Rather than employing the current approach of ""excess is best"" and keeping the gore and special effects to a minimum, Kent keeps us engrossed in the transformation of Amelia's character into madness at the hands of the malevolent being- the Babadook.

Sure, this material has been done hundreds of times before- but this is an excellent spin on the ""supernatural being invading a house"" plot.  One star deducted for some ham-fisted dialog and lack of relevant exposition.  Also, the dreary set inside Amelia's house are cliche' and a bit lazy (and distracting).  Over all, well done.",1430092800,2,827,5.180451127819549

6702665,5,B00O20UHDO,"A few friends of mine were talking about this film and recommended it to me.  I pre-ordered the movie and was eager to see it because they were acting like it was the greatest thing ever.  I don't think it was the scariest horror film ever made but it did have eerie moments that will raise the hairs on the back of your neck.  The film does start a little slow and as I was watching it I was thinking about how miserable these characters are.  I stuck with it and things begin to make more sense.  The film has a long developing exposition that sets up the emotional grind that the two main characters are going through.  Many who watch this movie comment on how annoying the kid is.  I think the clever thing about this movie is that you begin to ""feel"" what the mother goes through and instead of becoming a passive viewer of events unfolding...you essentially become more involved.  The director could of demonstrated annoyances that the mother (Essie Davis) goes through but instead decides to throw the misery in the audience's faces repeatedly.  You can't help but to feel the desperation of the mother and couldn't help but to think what I would do in a situation like this.  Once the creature arrives, you wonder if all of this is sheer insanity but because both characters experience the Babadook, it develops into more of a mystery.  The ending was puzzling at first but if you take a moment, it all becomes very clear.  It is indeed a movie that contains a message but for those just seeking a thrill ride, it might be a little slow in development for you but you'll get there.  I thought the acting was very well done.  Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman certainly know how to evoke reactions from the audience.  I hear people saying, ""I can't stand that woman"" and ""That kid was so annoying...I just couldn't stand it"".  Well, reactions like are the greatest compliments for actors.

To me personally, the film leaves me with the thought that stress, conflict, and other weights of the world can manifest into things quite terrible.  These issues can stack up inside of us can certainly do great damage and need to be dealt with.  Although we deal with this stuff with the help of family and friends, these negative experiences will always be a part of us in some way.  We all handle our problems in differently and this film seems to explore this with audiences.  I enjoyed the film and it gave us some interesting lunch break conversations at work.

The Blu Ray special edition comes in a red sleeve that can open up to reveal what looks to be a page out of the Babadook book.  The film looks great but I do agree with others that you will be adjusting the volume on this a lot.  It can get really soft sometimes and then super loud.  There are also some great extras like deleted scenes, cast and crew interviews, and Jennifer Kent's short film entitled ""Monster"".  This short film obviously became the inspiration for the movie and it's interesting to watch.  I especially enjoyed the interview with the artist who created the book for the movie as well.  I enjoyed the film for it's developing thrills and the pondering message it leaves us with.  I recommend this one highly.",1430006400,2,3189,4.535901926444834

There were several plot devices and plantings, but they never paid off. E.g. the cute guy at work who seems willing to care for and protect the mother; he just ""vanishes"". Also the constant falling scenes and mentionings of the father didn't develop into something more. The sound mixing was atrocious. I had to turn up and down the volume. The acting was bad.

I thought it was an excellent effort for such a low budget, and pretty creepy, with a lack of gore that, in the context of the film, was quite refreshing.  It won't appeal to those who need their horror spoon fed to them, that's for sure.

Reminded me a bit of '1408.'  Like that movie. this film is an allegory about the pain of loss, and the psychological trauma that comes with failing to process grief, as much as it is a pure horror flick.  I would have given it four stars, but the ending seemed an afterthought, like the producer just ran out of money, and said to the director: ""OK, make something up in the next ten minutes and shoot it.""

The plot was shallow, characters were underdeveloped, the little effects that were used were terrible, and the story/screenplay was embarrassingly amateurish! The main child star was obnoxious and annoying! Thank God Essie Davis saved this horrible script with her acting, which was even sometimes over the top! There were NO scares. We weren't ever even slightenly frightened. This movie was a total waste of time, and the Babadook was never completely revealed! Banshee Chapter was far more frightening and thought provoking!

As much as I like her acting, I found that the boy who played her son, Noah Wiseman, stole the show.  His facial expressions alone were far scarier than any part of the movie. He seemed a horrid little boy that came across more believable than expected.  My problem with the movie is a set of questions that were not answered -- for me.
1. What was the story with Amelia's tooth?
2.  Was her dead husband the Babadook?
3. Was her dead husband the one who brought the Babadook book into his family's life?
4. Was the son just like his father as Amelia said?
5. What was the purpose of the neighbor woman??
6. The worms were obviously for the Babadook, which lived in the cellar.  If so, why the big fear?
7. What was the purpose of the Babadook leaving the cellar in the first place, only to go back and wait for his ration of worms?
8.  Were the mother and son just a couple of wackos?

6702690,5,B00O20UHDO,"Let me be very clear.  If you want a movie about a scary boogeyman because you like turning your brain off for ninety minutes to experience a little primal fear, look elsewhere.  This is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, but it's not for the casual horror fan.  This is a horror film for people who keep their brain and empathy at 100% while watching a horror movie, the people like me who try to figure out what the monster is, what it wants, and whether I'm supposed to sympathize with the people it's terrorizing or the monster itself.  This movie isn't just clever, it's brilliant, but if you prefer your horror to be straightforward, to know exactly what you're getting on the tin, look elsewhere.

When the movie begins, you'll think it's about a problem child and the monster under his bed.  You may have a hard time liking this kid when he's at his worst, or caring about his mother when she's at the end of her wits.  If you're a parent and have been overwhelmed by your own kids, you may be torn between emotions.  Good.  Go with that and don't try to guess what's going on.  Just let yourself be sucked in by the film and be ready when the rug gets pulled out from under you.  I can't say anymore without spoiling the experience.  Just know that when your mouth is hanging open and you have no words, when you start to feel genuine terror because you understand what's really going on--whether it's psychological or magic realism, the point is that THE THING IN THE DARK IS REAL--that's when this movie is outstanding.  If someone tries to explain it to you before it's over, shush them.  Go ""la la la la"" until they shut their mouths and keep watching until the credits roll.  Like the best horror, this is a movie that will require you to feel and think your way through everything that happens, and it will stay with you afterwards.  I saw one reviewer say that it puts you through the emotional wringer and that you'll only want to see it once, and that may be true for some people, but it was worth it.",1429747200,3,2030,4.373333333333333

Is this the most unique horror movie of all time? Not really, nor is it the best I've ever seen, but the movie carries a very strong message that I can relate with, as well as many others; The dangers of over looking mental health, and the effect it could, and likely will have on you, and your family. I feel like people complaining about ending (as corny as it may be), completely missed the point and reason behind it and are blowing it out of proportion...but that's to be expected on the internet, I suppose.

The director couldn't come up with something more original? The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is due to an excellent performance by the lead actress.

I've seen tons of horror movies, and I know I have high expectations, but this movie was just bad/boring. I don't like movies that highlight the monster too much (see the end of Momma), but this movie didn't do it at all. It just feeds the viewer a constant barrage of absentee mom and petulant child, which other reviewers seem to think is intellectually scary (but it is not). There is ONE jump scene in the entire movie, and a distinct lack of keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat tension.

SPOILER
The monster is pretty much non-existant for the entire movie, but when it finally appears (sort of) at the end, it is more or less told to back off. For some ridiculous reason Babadook is happy to oblige. The movie ends with mom feeding worms to a captive/passive Babadook.

Seven years later, Amelia (Essie Davis) is attempting to raise her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone, while working at an elder care facility. Both are still devastated from the loss of Amelia's husband in the aforementioned crash. While Amelia has fallen into a deep, lonely depression, Samuel has become obsessed w/ protecting her, fearing that she could die at any moment. This causes Samuel to exhibit some peculiar behaviors, culminating in his being pulled out of school. Amelia is beside herself, unsure of what to do or where to turn. Right in the middle of all this, a strange book seems to simply appear in Samuel's bedroom. It's called MISTER BABADOOK, and its the world's creepiest, most disturbing pop-up book. After reading it to Samuel one night, odd things begin happening. At first, the weird occurrences are subtle and explainable. Soon however, Amelia finds herself in the midst of the unexplained and inexplicable. The tension rises and the pace accelerates, all the while becoming increasingly menacing and dangerous. Is Amelia losing her mind? Is she actually being stalked by a supernatural entity? Channeling atmosphere and elements from such classics as THE EXORCIST, THE SHINING,  A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, THE RING, and REPULSION, among others, THE BABADOOK manages to be a brilliant homage without becoming derivative. Ms. Davis is astonishing, shifting from terrified victim to terrifying threat w/ incredible ease. This can be viewed as a supernatural horror film, a psychological thriller, or both.

Like so many others, I was lured into seeing this waste of time by the good reviews, and I'm not happy about it!  Let's face it...new movies suck and no amount of praise is going to change that!!  One or two good ones squeeze in every 100 or so but in the end, new movies suck!!  There's no point in describing why this one sucked so bad because those who liked it will not listen and those who didn't like it already know that it sucks. At least the movie did reference other movies that are actually worth watching...Roman Polanski's REPULSION (they kept showing the ceiling lamp in Repulsion style.  And on a side note, try watching Polanski's THE TENANT which is way more creepy and unsettling than Babacrap), Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (that scary face in the tv movie they were watching in Babacrap), and Robert Wiene's CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (Babacrap looks like a cross between Edward Scissorhands and Dr. Caligari).  Try watching any of these movies to help drive away the disappointment you should feel from watching Babacrap.  For me, I'm now going to clear it from my movie palate by watching a truly interesting, entertaining, well-made, deserving of praise, far more horrific and creepy movie...Frank Henenlotter's BASKET CASE!

6702746,4,B00O20UHDO,"What a wonderfully ghastly creation we meet in Mr. Babadook. And I thought Michael Myers was scary. Move over, man.

There have been quite a few horror films about ""the boogie man"" over the decades, and a scant few hold genuine chills. ""The Babadook"" is effective psychological horror for those spook fans who are drawn to a slow build of tension and a somber mood (a la ""The Shining"" and ""Alien"" where less is more). We are introduced to this little family that is in tatters and supreme stress, and just when you think things could not get more troubling .... a book appears out of nowhere.

I suspect this is a film that has divided viewers. Those horror mavens thirsty for lots of jump scares and mayhem and violence will be thoroughly let down, but those who prefer a slow chill and some ambiguity will be handsomely rewarded. The acting is powerful, and the whole vibe and look of the film works to create something ominous. Washed out blue walls and sparse furnishings make for a good canvas to paint terror upon. Plus, the sound design is great.

And then there's that book. That delightfully twisted picture book. It was just the right touch. Like Maurice Sendak meets Edward Gorey, but much worse.

It's refreshing when a thriller comes along that is head and shoulders above the rest. So, lock the doors and windows, turn off the lights, sit back, and enjoy.",1429315200,2,1369,4.621399176954733
6702747,4,B00O20UHDO,"It's nice to see that horror films seem to be getting better these days.  Perhaps it's just me, but it seems more and more films are eschewing the gore of the slasher and becoming more suspense driven.  This film by first time feature director, Jennifer Kent provides an excellent story (she also wrote) of psychological terror that may or may not be real.

Amelia (excellent Essie Davis) is a single mother struggling with her 8 year old son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) who has developed an odd way of acting out, both at home and at school.  He believes a ""boogieman"" is out to get him, so Amelia is awakened every night to ""sweep"" his room to give him assurances there is no monster.  Not satisfied, Samuel has invented various mechanisms to fend off the monster.  This includes some kind of ""weapon"" that looks like a vacuum cleaner attached to a backpack.  He wears it to school, which of course makes him the brunt of countless taunts.

Amelia's job as a caretaker at a nursing home becomes precarious as Samuel's behavior at school becomes more problematic and she must stay home with him.  Putting Samuel to bed, he asks his mom to read a book to him.  She had never seen it before.  It is called ""Mr. Babadook.""  As she reads it, she finds it full of scary pictures and even scarier language.  She tries to get rid of the book but it resurfaces.  As strange ""bumps in the night"" begin she gets more and more drawn into Samuel's world.

The first half of the movie which sets up the premise can be trying on the viewer.  Especially the somewhat wierd Samuel.  But stick with it, it gets better as the mother and son must team up to survive.  Davis's transformation from a harried mom to the edge of psychosis is acting magic.  The film reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining.""  Short on blood and guts, long on tension, terror and suspense.  Recommended.

The Blu ray disc comes in 1080p video resolution with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  Hopefully your display does a good job with black levels because much of the film is shot in low light, night time sequences.  Even ""Babadook"" is all black, so his presence is sometimes hard to discern (I suspect on purpose).  The detail is excellent and flesh tones are perfect.  Don't expect a lot of color as it is clearly missing, again on purpose.  What we have is a darkness throughout, well displayed.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack is the one to choose.  This film has a very creepy soundtrack with plenty of special effects that sometimes goes beyond the thumps and bumps you might expect.  The surrounds are in play, especially with Jed Kurzel's great musical score.  There are Spanish and English SDH subtitles.  There are some nice extras including Kent's 10 minute film ""Monster,"" deleted scenes, a piece on creating the book for the film, a tour of the house, stunts, special effects: the stabbing scene, interviews, a trailer and a short called ""Behind the Scenes.""",1429315200,3,2932,4.633009708737864
6702748,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook, like Sinister, is one of those horror movies that has far more of an impact if you happen to be a parent, I think.
Personally, I found it to be a substantially more spooky movie than a lot of the things I've seen...relying less on jump scares than a sense of tension the narrative builds up in the viewer(s) combined with a genuinely creepy premise.
This is one of those movies like Session 9, where you spend a good portion of the time unsure as to whether there is actually some supernatural agent imposing its malevolent will upon the character or if these apparent supernatural elements are manifestations of a psychological breaking point being reached.
There is a very real transition that takes place within both of the protagonists through the course of the movie, especially where the son is concerned, going from a child that would legitimately drive any parent insane to the more stable and coherent voice in the household by the climax.
There have been a number of good films to have come out of Australia over the years, but this one is going to be within my top five for some time to come, I suspect.",1429315200,,1128,4.589108910891089

I am tired of these films because they are similar in certain ways but with different ghosts or here with a babadook, the movie is not scary at all and seems more childish as if made specifically for scaring maybe young kids with their parents watching with them. If you are tired of films like The others, woman in black - only the new version the original was great, the sixth sense and even the Innocents from the 1960s which maybe started the child ghosts thing then you will probably not like this movie.

6702755,5,B00O20UHDO,"This movie *actually* is one of the best (perhaps it's even the best) horror movies released in a long. Where most horror films rely heavily (and wrongly so, in my opinion) on jump-scares, this movie doesn't. What it does do is create an atmospheric sense of dread. Everything about this movie was thought out with great care: every shot, the filtered, depressing colors, and especially the performances.

The premise: seven years after the death of her husband (and the birth of her son; they happened on the same day) Amelia is struggling to raise her son, Samuel, who has, ""Severe behavioral problems."" In addition to this, her son is highly imaginative to the point that she must check under his bed and closet for monsters every night before bed. One night, when it's Samuel's turn to choose the bedtime story, he brings to her a mysterious book entitled ""Mr. Babadook."" When she reads it, the first few pages are very childish. However, as she continues, the book becomes more and more sinister until the point that Samuel is brought to tears.

The book tells of a monster called ""Mr. Babadook."" Sam instantly believes it to be the truth, but Amelia doubts him. Mr. Babadook, who is very much real, visits Samuel several times, terrifying him. His mother refuses to believe in such, ""Rubbish."" But as strange things begin to happen around her, violent visions, and visits from Mr. Babadook himself, she comes to realize the horrible truth: ""If it's in a word, or a look, you can't get rid of the Babadook.""

I must say that this movie is not going to be for everyone. Some people will watch it and find it too slow. It is a very progressive movie, and you start to see the changes slowly, the eeriness growing steadily, along with the dread, until it finally climaxes. The last twenty minutes has some of the finest acting ever caught on film, and the intensity is so great that I'm sure most people will find that they're grinding their teeth in anticipation.

What this film is not is a cheap, summer horror flick. What it is is a slow, well thought out physiological horror that is on par with (and even similar to) the works of some of the greatest directors of all time, namely Stanley Kubrick. Writer and director Jennifer Kent has surpassed all expectations with her debut masterpiece, The Babadook. It's use of metaphors make this film not just one of the best horror movies of all time, but one of the best survival dramas as well.

6702761,5,B00O20UHDO,"Have you ever seen a horror film where things seemed just slightly off - not in a bad production way, but like you were trapped in a nightmare and couldn't wake up? That's the closest I can come to describe the feeling that The Babadook delivers. This is a genuine horror film - not a gore film - there is an ever present sense of dread that the director has created - which I'm sure was exactly the intent.

So what the heck is this film and why haven't you heard of it? Frankly, I don't know. This Australian film should have gotten much much wider release in the U.S., but it didn't. It's a low budget film that reaches WAY beyond its budget! On the film circuit in 2014 it got great reviews and in release it made more than double its budget - but I suspect that it is in rentals and DVD that this film is going to make its real money.

This is not a flash in the pan kind of horror film - this is going to end up being a classic - I am sincere about that! What's more this film actually is multi-layered - in other words the overall theme and script will have you thinking for days afterward.

I can't speak too highly of this film!

So what's it about?
Sam is a six year old boy - almost seven - and his widowed mother is struggling to make ends meet because she is terribly depressed about the loss of her husband. He died in a car wreck as he drove his wife to the hospital to deliver Sam. So every year, Sam's birthday is also a reminder that it was the day her husband died.

While Sam is exuberant and overall cheerful, he's got an imagination and requires attention. His mother reads him stories at bedtime. One night he pulls out a book she's never seen before - The Babadook. As she reads it to him, she realizes it's not appropriate for the boy - it's a terribly frightening story about a monster in the closet.

Sam is terrified and Mom is beside herself. And then things start to happen....

I'm amazed that this movie has gotten so many mixed reviews and isn't acclaimed immediately as a classic but to each their own, I suppose. Still, from the stand-point of lighting design, story-telling, character-crafting, special effects, and set design, this film is amazingly done. I don't normally notice how lighting plays into cinema as clearly as I did here, and each time I noticed it, it filled me with dread. This movie is completely devoid of cheap, silly, agitating jumpscares and focuses solely and just messing with your head and making your heart crawl upwards into your throat while you're watching it. I've never been more scared while watching a movie, and it's been forever since one has made me lose so much sleep--and I'm not even mad about it!

To be honest though, I'm kind of a scaredy-cat. So I'm not sure how much this will scare hardcore horror-movie fans but I'm sure it will leave you in suspense!

6702769,5,B00O20UHDO,"Grief is such a powerful thing, it can be crippling, maddening and terrifying all in one. I have first had experience after loosing my father at a young age, I still fight with the sadness and have to work to keep the grief in check. THE BABADOOK plays with that concept, to such astonishing results.

Amelia is a still grieving wife, a woman lost in the sadness of the violent lose of her husband; and left to care for the child that she feels took him from her in some way. Sam was born the same day as her husbands death, and even though not spoken; she feels he is somewhat to blame; and over the 7 years since that horrible day a rift has grown between mother and child. Amelia lives in a state of both denial but deep grief, and Sam is desperate for love and attention, and has his own underlining fears. Fear of an unseen monster and fear of the lose of his mother. That is where we pick up the story, both are struggling through life together. Amelia in a daze, and Sam in a constant state of fight or flight; a fear that causes him to lash out and go above and beyond with protecting himself and his mother. Then one night, when it's time for bed, Sam picks out a book for mom to read and ""Mister Babadook"" opens up a spiraling nightmare that circles the two closing in on them and trying to drive them both mad.

Many people seem to not get the film, I've read so many reviews where people don't find the film scary, and fuss about lack of scares. But, this isn't that type of film on the whole. While there are some truly disturbing moments that deal with the dark presence that is The Babadook; the underlining fear of the film is lose of ones self from fear, grief and ultimately madness. The ending is the perfect place to observe this, instead of taking the easy ""we defeated the monster"" approach, creator and director Jennifer Kent uses the entire film and the ending as a metaphor. The Babadook, is literally the embodiment of Amelia's grief, fear and despair. A living thing created by her inability to deal with her pain, and in accepting the pain and acknowledging it she, she beats it; BUT you can't rid yourself of grief, pain and despair; you can merely alleviate it and learn to live with it. Hence the films ending.

The acting in the film is stellar; with Essie Davis giving a tour de force performance as Amelia; and young Noah Wiseman is crazy good as her young son Samuel. They so wonderfully portray a dysfunctional family, and pull off the love/hate relationship that comes from their grief and fear. The creation of The Babadook itself is stellar, with the use of Nosferatu and the father's clothes making a truly creepy entity. The bedroom sequence midway through the film is a thing of nightmares. The film is beautiful to watch, the colors are dark and crisp and the film seems to grow grayer and more dim as the threat of The Babadook grows. The film as a whole is by far one of the best horror films I've seen in years, and the intelligence of it helps strengthen that aspect. This is definitely a thinking man's film.

The bluray comes with a plethora of special features; something that fans of SCREAM FACTORY have become use to. With a few mini features, several deleted scenes and almost an hour and a half of cast and crew interviews to watch, the supplemental package is amazing. The bluray also comes with a fantastic collectible slip cover modeled after the creepy ""Mister Babadook"" pop up book from the film; and the inward art work is reversible with both a black slip and a white cover on the reverse side. It's definitely another stellar release from SCREAM FACTORY.

I say if you love a good psychological thriller that focuses more on real life horror than on supernatural horror, you will love this film. It does have its share of truly frightening ""horror"" moments, but if your expecting SAW, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or PARANORMAL ACTIVITY then your watching the wrong film.

6702770,2,B00O20UHDO,"Overhyped and inferior to the films it liberally borrows from (The Shining, Carrie, The Exorcist and Poltergeist to name a few), The Babadook is an exercise in unrealized potential.  Never once was I truly scared watching it (the 3-minute short film ""Lights Out"" is far more unnerving).  The movie fumbles a promising premise, substituting annoying cinematic flourishes for true storytelling power and coherence.  While the acting is commendable, the whole endeavor feels half-baked; the script should have been honed further before filming began.  And stop with the dog killing already.  I've seen so many ""horror"" films where the dog exists for the sole purpose of being slaughtered.  As a hackneyed film motif, it ranks up there with the fleeing girl who trips while being pursued by the maniac.  Lazy writing at its worst.

6702773,5,B00O20UHDO,"Amelia is a single mother coping with the loss of her husband, trying to figure out her son Samuel's fascination with a monster that lives in his room. Samuel is causing problems at school and in Amelia's admittedly small social life. But really, that's only the beginning. Because Amelia begins sensing that something is wrong as well. That sudden roach infestation. Creaks and groans in the house at night. Shadowy figures haunting her waking and sleeping moments. A reality that begins to spiral into madness, where Amelia isn't sure what is what...or who she is...but she only knows one thing: you can't let the Babadook in.

I'd heard this movie got under your skin. And oh boy, does it. I talked a friend who said she'd watched it a few weeks ago and it still haunted her. I found myself shaking while watching it. This is a true blend of psychological and visceral horror. Oh, there's a little gore (not much), and some things that go bump in the night. But as with the best horror films, what truly terrifies in THE BABADOOK is what you don't exactly see, but what you know is going on. What you're terrified is going to happen next. It's a film that builds on itself, descending into a sort of madness that perhaps feels a little too close for comfort.

You can thank the lead actors: Essie Davis and the terrific child actor Noah Wiseman. You can thank writer/director Jennifer Kent, who's crafted a magnificent little horror film. The ending plays a little weak, considering the strength of everything that builds up to it, but it's actually rather satisfying when you stop and think about it. And if not...well, THE BABADOOK is so good, and so unnerving, that a couple of minutes isn't going to ruin it for you. It's terrifying. It's hide your eyes behind your hands and peak around your fingers terrifying. I haven't been this scared and giddy in quite a while. A good, good, scary little film.",1429142400,,1907,4.655786350148368
6702774,5,B00O20UHDO,"""The Babadook"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Amelia is a single mother plagued by the violent death of her husband. When a disturbing storybook called Mister Babadook turns up at her house, she is forced to battle with her son's deep-seated fear of a monster. Soon she discovers a sinister presence all around her.

The cast led by Essie Davis (superb as Amelia) & Noah Wiseman (also superb as Samuel) is brilliant. The directing & story & screenplay (based on her short film ""Monster"") by Jennifer Kent is brilliant.

The music by Jed Kurzel is brilliant. The cinematography by Radek Ladczuk is brilliant. The film editing by Simon Njoo is brilliant. The casting by Nikki Barrett is brilliant. The production design by Alex Holmes (also did the art direction) is brilliant. The art direction by Holmes & Karen Hannaford is brilliant. The set decoration by Jennifer Drake, set dressings by Amy Baker & Jessie Mills, set designs by Ross Perkin is brilliant. The costume design by Heather Wallace is brilliant. The prosthetic effects by Justin Dix & supervised by Dale Bamford are brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Clint Dodd is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Marty Pepper is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Reg Roordink is brilliant.

This is a brilliant and well-crafted horror / thriller that is entertaining and well-done (as well as, well-made, too). It is also intriguing, interesting and effectively-crafted. Essie Davis gives a superb performance as Amelia and Noah Wiseman is just as superb as well as Samuel. Jennifer Kent has made a terrific and brilliant directorial (as well as screenwriting) debut, effectively making her a new voice in not only horror movies, but movies in general, too. This is (or was) one of the best films of the last year (also one of the best films that came out during last year's Thanksgiving season) and one of the best horror films, if not, the best horror film, of the last year and also of the last decade or two.",1429142400,2,1997,4.884955752212389

6702776,3,B00O20UHDO,"Australian indie fright flick 'The Babadook' (2014) has a lot going for it at first blush: a creepy children's book as a backbone, a slowly simmering sense of doom, disorienting photography and other nice technical touches, competent acting, etc.  So much so, in fact, that I was preparing to write up a four-star review going into the last 25 minutes of the film.  Then things went off the rails a bit.  Where writer/director Jennifer Kent goes wrong, I think, is in failing to commit intellectually to her own creation (is the Babadook real? imagined? the manifestation of a psychologically broken family? turns out it's all of the above-- something of a dramatic cop-out).  What might have been a brooding, disturbing, sublimely complex and terrifyingly provocative study of a single mother's descent into filicidal madness ends up somewhat abruptly in Freddy Krueger/Poltergeist territory, then, even more disappointingly, as an actual fairy tale ('Lamont the Lonely Monster' from my own childhood comes to mind), largely undermining what was constructed with such skill and deliberation in the first two-thirds of the story.  Still, overall, it's an entertaining and comparatively effective piece of horror (I don't understand why so many reviewers here insist it isn't horror, as it hardly could be classified as anything else), in its best moments framed by mood, sound, shadow and suggestion rather than overt action and exposition.  3-plus stars.",1429056000,3,1455,5.304347826086956
6702777,2,B00O20UHDO,"SPOILERS AHEAD.
The premise of The Babadook is very much like that of The Machinist (another psychological thriller and by far the better film, IMO): unresolved grief and guilt leading to depression and ultimately manifesting in a nightmarish physical way. However, whereas The Machinist is tight, tension-filled, and twisty, The Babadook is something of a mess.

But lets start with the positives.
1.) The pop-up book itself. Brilliantly done! One of the best thematic objects Ive ever seen in the horror and thriller genres.
2.) Production design. The sets for the house, especially their dreary color palette, were spot on.
3.) Acting. The actors did well with what they had. I wasn't blown away, but I wasn't groaning, either.

Now for the negatives  and some advice to script writers.
1.) The kid. Oy, that manic, screeching, demanding, out-of-control kid! He was so obnoxious, so alienating, I almost bailed out of the movie before the halfway point. This was not the fault of the young actor but rather a case of totally inept characterization. Bad, bad, BAD. A main player whos supposed to garner viewers sympathy should not grate on their nerves. I wanted that brat gone ASAP, and I didn't care how he went.
2.) The dog. Okay, Ive been a fan of horror and thrillers, both written and cinematic, for 50 years. I know all the clichs. One of the biggest is the inclusion of a pet for the sole purpose of killing it. Could any plot element be more unimaginative and off-putting? I mean, come on. Whatever the point of this sequence was (and Jennifer Kent does seem to like making A Point about everything), surely it could've been done with more subtlety and originality. Same is true of the bugs oozing out of the kitchen wall.
3.) Unanswered questions. Why did it take six years after Daddys death for the Babadoodoo to hit the fan? Whered the book come from? Why/how did the kid know of its existence in the house while the mother was oblivious? Why wasn't that squirrelly kid receiving psychiatric care? Why wasn't the image of the Babadook employed more creatively, and frighteningly, throughout the film?

All in all, I was disappointed. I thought I'd be in for a real chillfest. Um ... nope. The Babadook is an unscary, often clumsily executed, and sometimes downright annoying movie that has a few good things going for it. Not as boring as the also-overhyped Only Lovers Left Alive, but not as cohesive, either.",1429056000,5,2425,4.808153477218226

I sorta figured at the end of the movie they would explain it and wrap it up in a nice little bow for the dimwitted viewers out there.  Im kinda glad they didnt.  Are we that far gone as a society that things have to be spoon fed to use?

The of course there are reviewers that did get it and are angry that it wasn't just another horror movie with a monster.  Really guys?  You just want horror movies to follow the same formula and if it doesnt you get angry.

With that out of the way, the movie was daring and didn't follow your typical horror movie formula.  Its sort of has a happy ending but not in a way you would expect.  By the time her son is 10 or 12 i have a feeling he will figure it out himself but for now lives in his moms world of crazy.

6702803,5,B00O20UHDO,"IFC Midnight unleashes the critically acclaimed Australian psychological horror film The Babadook into your home. Here is an effective thriller which climbs inside your head and drags all your worst fears and insecurities to the surface. It will haunt not only your nightmares as some of the disturbing events take place in the safety of the day.

In The Babadook, a troubled widow (Essie Davis) discovers that her son (Noah Wiseman) is telling the truth. He is seeing a monster that entered their home through the pages of a children's book. Together, they must fight to remove the sinister creature from their lives while they spiral more and more into insanity.

Although Ive heard complaints from some that they never really show the monster, I find that to be a part of the mystery surrounding The Babadook. You only get fleeting glimpses of what the creature truly is. I see it as a combination of Dr. Caligari and a Spanish horror icon known as Coffin Joe. Thats all Ill give away about its appearance.

The Babadook is unrated but could hold an R. A sexually explicit scene with no nudity is found. It also includes violence involving a child. Many times the child is dishing out the violence. Frightening and intense sequences of the monster are guaranteed to frighten viewers. Theres also profanity and the child is given a sedative to help him sleep.

The Blu-ray edition of The Babadook boasts some insightful bonus material. We get over an hour of interviews with the cast and crew. Theres also behind-the-scenes footage and a theatrical trailer included.

The Babadook truly is an exercise in psychological horror that must be seen. It takes your worst fears and darkest thoughts and parades them onscreen in front of you to deal with and work out. You could even call it a sort of extreme grief and parental therapy if you truly dig into the meanings behind the movie.",1428451200,,1883,4.799382716049383

6702812,5,B00O20UHDO,"Jennifer Kents The Babadook is a unique and ambitious foray into the genre of horror. Its a harrowing and haunting look into the life of a widowed mother of one young son who is still attempting to cope with the loss of her husband years earlier. Horror movies are typically all about the killing of teens and involve drugs and sex but The Babadook has none of this, and instead trades it all in for a genuinely creepy premise, an effective monster, and convincing acting that results in one of the best horror films of the 21st century.

The mother in our story is Amelia, a woman who was involved in a terrible car crash while pregnant that killed her husband and ultimately left her alone in raising her son, Samuel. The first scene is of Amelia having a dream of when the crash happened, so its obvious that she still dwells on it even after so many years. One night as she is putting Samuel to bed, he picks out a book he wants read to him. Its a mysterious book Amelia has never seen before called Mister Babadook and its ominous as hell even from the cover. The further Amelia reads into the story, it becomes darker and more graphic (the book is presented in a childrens book style with illustrations and pop-ups and is truly a disturbing spectacle to look at), speaking about a horrifying monster coming to eat you. Samuel goes on to believe that the Babadook is actually stalking them within their house, and, over the course of the movie, Amelia starts to believe this too.

As the viewer, we don't know if Samuel is lying about seeing the monster, and we aren't even sure if what Amelia is seeing is real, either. Sleep deprivation plays a major part in the movie, as it is obvious that Amelia cannot for the life of her get any amount of sleep. This loss of sleep plays with the audience, as sleep deprivation can lead to awful side effects of hallucinations and cognitive impairment. The realization in the ending as to what the monster truly is is up for debate, but I have a solid argument as to what it all means, and its truly interesting and executed in a disturbingly beautiful fashion.

The Babadook is a movie that pushes the horror genre forward and is possibly the greatest ever horror movie directed by a woman (perhaps Mary Harrons American Psycho edges this out). The Babadook deserves to be watched by anyone who loves horror films, or film in general. After all, its not often that we are presented with a horror movie that is so well shot, acted so genuinely, and so disturbing that youll be thinking about it for weeks after you see it.",1427846400,2,2567,4.480769230769231

Before Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho, the only type of villains exposed to viewers were fictional. These monsters were supernatural such as werewolves, vampires, and the boogeyman. These obvious monsters were always defeated in the end. It was not until 1960, with the release of Psycho, that the idea that the villain could be anyone was introduced. Your neighbor could be a monster, your father or even you. The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent, is a psychological film that plays on human fears. A single mother, Amelia, is on the verge of a breakdown. Trying to remain strong, she continues with her everyday routines: work and raising her child, Samuel. But after the horrible accident that happened six years earlier, she was never the same. Her out of control sons violent behavior, causes her to slowly isolate herself from everyone.
At first glance, The Babadook may sound like a dark tale. It plays upon the stereotype that children are silly and make up wild stories. If they are talking to someone that adults cannot see, then they must have an imaginary friend. After all, Babadook sounds like a spinoff of being a silly urban legend, such as Slender Man. Surprisingly, the film takes a twist in plot. Just when the viewer thinks that the monster is fictional, we discover that the real monster is actually Amelia. The real horror is realizing that the monster can be within us. After years of resenting her son, and suppressing her emotions about her husbands tragedy, Amelias conscious creates Babadook. Amelia realizes that she is able to contain the monster. By realizing this, she is no longer trapped. Babadook no longer has control over her, and she is able to awaken from her daily nightmares. She is able to contain the monster.
Jennifer Kent does an amazing job of steering away from campy scares. Instead of loud, jump scares, the film does an excellent job of presenting the sadness and violence that coincides with Babadooks presence and how he effects the unity of the family. His appearance has more terror since he is always lurking in the shadows. This plays upon our fears. Often times, we are afraid of what we cannot see. So how can we fight the enemy of it is invisible? All in all, the film is creative in how it explores the dark side of humanity. The movie goes beyond what one would expect to the typical horror genre.",1427846400,2,2392,4.805825242718447
6702814,4,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook is considered such a smart film by critics for many reasons. One of the main ones being that it is so different. It stands out from other films by not having simple jump scares, instead it elongates the scaring process which creates dread and suspense for the audience. This aspect makes it stand out because it is not as predictable as typical Hollywood horror films can be. The film really taps into the audiences emotions through the psychological instability of the main character, Amelia, and her issues with her son. It is clear that many viewers would be able to connect with the tragic circumstances she had to face, rather than the idea of experiencing a supernatural being. Either way the film allows viewers to make their own interpretations as to what the Babadook really is. Throughout the film Amelia is seen struggling with the mystery of what the Babadook is and what it will do to her family. From the very beginning of the film she is portrayed as someone who is soft spoken but emotionally and psychologically strong. As the story goes on the audience sees her transform as her fears crack through her tough exterior and her sanity begins to be questioned. As time went on she began to represent the idea of Scopophilia. A warning from the Babadook was Once you look underneath youd wish you were dead. That idea alone implanted the fear of looking inside her. That fear is easily translated to the audience, which makes the viewer curious but fearful at the same time. In essence this makes the film one you don't want to look away from. Though it was not very scary as a whole, it was well made and different from the typical horror film. Definitely worth watching.",1427846400,,1699,4.666666666666667
6702815,5,B00O20UHDO,"Jennifer Kents compelling film, The Babadook, allows viewers to face their biggest fears in the form of an internalized monster that preys upon the main character and her son.  Utilizing the simplistic and innocent method of childrens story, Kent is able to create a visually stunning film which incorporates the concept of a monster you cannot escape, because he is always with you, lurking over your shoulder, and inside your mind.  In essence, The Babadook conveys the scariest type of demon, the one within yourself, and it is this parallelism seen between the loving, but stressed out mother, Amelia, and the dangerous Mister Babadook, which makes Jennifer Kents directorial debut such a strong and intelligent step into innovating the horror genre.  What makes Kents film so smart, is the way in which she highlights the grieving process and the idea of guilt, which affects all aspects of your life and inhibits you from functioning at your best.  By creating a truly entertaining film, with an amazing cast, Kent allows us to step into the world of a mother wrecked by despair and loss, and in doing so, she flips the normalized conventions of horror on its head by constructing a brilliant ending, in which the main character never truly vanquishes the monster, because the message of Kents film is that emotional grief and trauma are things you may never get over, and instead its all about control and facing your inner demons head on.  Lastly, The Babadook, also showcases how a minimalistic plot and monochromatic color scheme can truly work together and in doing so enhances the overall tone of the film.  In closing, The Babadook is a remarkable film and I highly recommend it.",1427846400,,1692,4.919298245614035

  ""The Babadook"" is a beautiful film that deals with grief, repression, and facing your demons - both literally and metaphorically in the film. Jennifer Kent creates an entire universe in her in film that echoes the themes of the story so beautifully that it's made the film into a legend.
I liked the cinematography of the film. The house in which the main character Amelia lives with her son, Samuel, really gives the viewer a sense of who she is as a character. Her home is dressed in cold colors - primarily blues and greys and gives the home heaviness and sense of foreboding. Amelia also dresses in bland colors but primarily warmer colors when she goes to work or outside of her home. From this we can assume the old clich of ""putting on a happy face"" or a front for how you really feel.

  Similarly, the sound of the film was enchanting. The effects and music gave the film a captivating pacing and mood. The film also had great connections to other films and pays homage to horror films before it like ""Black Sabbath"" and Roman Polanski films.  It should also be noted that the actress who plays Amelia, Essie Davis, was fabulous. Her range in this film from the look of exhaustion to the voice changes she has when talking to someone outside her home or the Babadook was so incredibly executed. The entire story, esthetic, and mise en scene of ""The Babadook"" is simply glorious.

  The only thing that ""cursed"" the film, or was a draw-back for me, was that I found it to be over-hyped. I was told numerous times from friends, film critics, and celebrities that it was the scariest movie in ages - even the director of The Exorcist, William Friedkin, said ""I've never seen a more terrifying film than `The Babadook.'"" The film deals with a real concept of personal demons, shadow selves, and repressed emotions boiling back to the surface in the form of a monster but it wasn't as scary as I had expected it to be and because I had such high expectations I found myself waiting for more to happen in the film.

  I can recommend this film for someone to appreciate the sheer artistry behind it but I can not with confidence say this film is scary. My advice - watch it with no expectations of fright and, hopefully, be pleasantly surprised.",1427846400,2,2286,4.546341463414634

The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent, is a wonderfully crafted psychological horror film that preys on our fear of depression and the concept of a ""boogeyman"". This film owes a lot to German Expressionist films. The Babadook itself is a black and white shape that resembles a figure similar in looks of Nosferatu. The movie itself is very surreal. The paint jobs and color of clothing are dull and grey, representing our main character's(Amelia) fight with depression over the lost of her husband. Even Amelia herself turns a greyish tone during the course of the film, going from a somewhat stable human to a weak, tired, and grief filled being. It's obvious that plenty of care and thought was put in this movie.

Another wonderful thing about The Babadook is the emotional connection it forms with the audience. We as the audience are meant to believe that the Babadook is merely part of Amelia's and Sam's imagination. There is no physical representation of the Babadook other than the stress it puts on Amelia. Then the film throws a curveball at us, near the movie the Babadook becomes a physical entity, or so we think. *Major Spoiler* The Babadook is real, in the fact that is represents grief in the loss of a loved one. It  is the sadness we feel and it overcomes Amelia. She is consumed by this grief and in turns becomes the evil that is the Babadook. She manages to force the Babadook into the basement to signify that this grief will always be there, but now Amelia and Sam have learn to live with the Babadook.",1427760000,,1549,4.6911764705882355
6702820,5,B00O20UHDO,"Babadook illustrates a single mothers dark and depressing struggle to cope with the literal and figurative demons that haunt her and her son, Samuel.  This movie uses slow-building tension rather than gore and cheap scares to create a truly creepy metaphorical tale of a mothers spiraling depression.  There are very few jump scares, in fact I didn't find this movie particularly scary in the sense of wanting to look away or hide under the covers, however its a film that plays with your head and stays with you even after its over.  Other reviewers have complained that they hated the child because of how obnoxious he is but I see that as a successful aspect because thats the way he was supposed to be- even his aunt couldn't stand to be around him, so if the audience is annoyed by his character its a win in my opinion. I think one of the reasons this movie is so daunting is because were brought very closely into the personal lives of this family; were shown the mothers day to day struggles with her disobedient son and her lack of support from family and cant help but feel extremely sad for them.  We see them at the hardest time of the year, Samuels birthday, which is also the anniversary of the car crash that killed his father on the way to the hospital to deliver him.  We watch as this familys misery becomes too much for them to bear and we are forced to wonder whether they are being haunted by the supernatural or mental illness.  This film is a brilliant metaphor of the darkness that life can bring, and shows that even when we confront the scariest of monsters, we still have to live with them.",1427760000,,1617,4.464406779661017

Jennifer Kent did an amazing job making the audience feel a type of scared I have never felt before. I wasn't sure how a pop-up-book character would be scary, but I found out watching this movie. Its not so much that the movie is scary by making the audience jump, but its scary in the sense that it takes your head in its claw like hands and rattles you until you cant take it anymore. The sound, lighting, and acting all come together to make you feel like no other movie will. With one of the main characters being a young boy, you immediately take his side, and in doing so, the storybook monster seems bigger than before. The sound is another thing that takes this movie to the next level. Jennifer Kent said in an interview with The Dissolve, I knew when I got to put the sound in the movie, the sound I heard in my head. It would be terrifying. Truer words have never been said! When you watch the movie, you aren't just watching, you are listening, to the disturbing, high pitched sounds of The Babadook. Think about grinding your teeth, or nails on a chalkboard, and that is how you will feel listening to this movie. Everyone needs to experience The Babadook, because, If its in a word, or its in a look, you cant get rid of the Babadook.",1427760000,,1401,4.290566037735849

Honestly, I feel like today many modern horror film follow the same form such as a quick paced slasher film mixed with an over used monster plot device that I often found myself watching horror films that lacked substance. Sure, some many have been entertaining but they never stuck out to me as a truly well done horror film. However, when it comes to the Babadook, this is a film that stands out amongst the rest of many modern horror films I've seen. It's frightening on so many levels. You have an obvious monster element within the film that is presented very well, however, if you start to focus on other elements of the film such as the mental health of both the mother and her child, and her relationship with her son and others around her, you start to see that the babadook provides other levels of horror that go beyond just the monster element.

 The Babadook is a masterpiece that creates horror without horror. There are no ultra-gory scenes, supernatural killers, or sexually active teenagers. These elements are not present at all in The Babadook. Just because these elements are not present, does not mean this film terrible; one should not judge a book by its cover (unless the book is called Mister Babadook). What this film presents us is a different type of horror for those seeking new tastes: psychological horror. This is why many critics consider The Babadook a smart film.  There is nothing more horrifying than seeing Amelia (Essie Davis) hunt her child Samuel (Noah Wiseman) at the orders of her demon, Mister Babadook. The idea of a murderous mother, the universal caretaker turn evil, is enough to bring shivers down a persons spine.
 Also, Mister Babadook is a fine example how smart this film really is. Mister Babadook is not a generic serial killer, nor is he a freak of nature. Mister Babadook is the depression that many people around the world have to deal with.  Mister Babadook crawls under the skin, and forces people to do things they would never do. Depression does the same, and many people suffer and die because of it. Even if Mister Babadook is a fictional character, there are many people who are haunted by their own real version of the Babadook.  The fact that a version of the Babadook can exist in real life adds to the psychological fear created by this film.
 In the end, if you are looking for great psychological horror film that will make you question your rational, then look no further than The Babadook, for even in real life, you cant get rid of The Babadook.",1427760000,,1859,4.704615384615384

This film shows how the remains of death continue to destroy the family long after the dead body has been buried. The Babadook uses a real human fear as the basis of the actual monster. The thought of losing his mother makes Sam create weapons and constantly protect her. As for the main character Amelia, she has yet to come to terms with her husbands death. This is seen throughout the film. She insists no one even speaks of her husbands name. Her years of living in denial have caused her to repress her grief. The Babadook takes advantage of this by becoming an apparition of Amelias deceased husband, coaxing her to give away Sam. By defeating the monster inside and outside, the process almost becomes therapeutic for both Amelia and Sam. Both are able to come to term with what has happened even embracing the monster down in the basement.

The cinematography in The Babadook is seamless. The film was well shot for having such a low budget. The use of blacks, dark blues and greys played heavy on the thrill factor; never really knowing where the Babadook truly was.

When someone asks for a suggestion on a smart horror film, The Babadook is the only one that should come up. Modern horror has a reputation of being all about gore, nudity, and dumb choices. This film challenges all those preconceptions.
 One great characteristic of The Babadook is that it does not rely on cheap tricks to give the audience a scare. Many movies use sudden images and music to provoke a jump. This film takes fear from another perspective. While there are some surprise scares, the terror comes from not knowing. The film keeps the audience in the dark about what is going on. There is also an abuse of scopophilia. There is a feeling that you are being watched. The scary part is that you do not who or when you are being watched. The whole film leads to being paranoid.  On the other hand some people might say the scariest part is the reality of the situation. There is a mother who is abusing and neglecting her son. This is a horror that many people live in real life.
 The best part of the film is that, unlike some horror films, the characters are believable. They are not going around making impractical decisions for the sake of moving the plot forward. These characters have emotions and drive behind the way they live their life. These characters are showing a deeper story about a family struggling through unfortunate events. The film showcases abuse and neglect. A pregnant woman loses her husband and gives birth to a boy. She is left to tackle life as a single mother with the burden of tragic loss. While in the film the Babadook is a monster, it could also stand for the demons inside the human mind. It could be said that the audience is seeing the film through the lens of the mother. Her lack of sleep and emotional distress could give reason for a monster being possible in her reality. As she lets her mind get the best of her, she takes it out on her son. He is trying to survive a mother who is depressed. She does not feed him or treat him properly. As they learn to be a team and face the demons that haunt their past and present, they learn to cope with their tragedy. As depicted in the film, the Babadook, does not get destroyed, it lives in the basement. This shows that the mother still has the feeling of depression and may feel the need to take it on her son, but they are both working together to make their future a better on.",1427673600,,2389,4.400452488687783

A lot of things like to happen or come in threes: comedy comes in threes, The Three Musketeers, The Three Stooges... whenever there is a creepy presence in a house, it does things in threes.  The number three seems to be a magic number throughout The Babadook.  Most of the dialogue from the characters are spoken three times anytime the babadook  is involved.  Even when the presence is around, you can hear three knocks, three scratches and the voice of the babadook going ""Ba- ba- ba dook, dook, dook.""  Something that was really terrifying with the presence of the babadook was that anytime Amelia was trying to get rid of the babadook, there would be an eerie score playing in the background and it wouldn't stop until the presence was fully out of sight.  One example is when she tears the book apart and throws it into the trash can.  The sound doesn't stop until she shuts the lid of the trash can... thinking she is rid of the book's presence.  This film also makes you really think about the psychological aspect of horror.  You really have to use your mind when trying to figure out if the babadook is actually a real thing or a figment of someone's imagination.  This leads to the theory of the ""monster"" being an allegory for Amelia's husband.  In the beginning, you notice that she is obsessed with losing her husband because she keeps all of his belongings in the basement which is kept locked.  Then, there is the connection of how the babadook in the story had Amelia kill Samuel and the husband also wanted to kill Samuel by saying, ""We could be together again... you can bring me the boy.""  So both the babadook and the husband were after Samuel making them one person with the same objective.  Finally, the presence of the babadook hides away into the basement, where Amelia's dead husband's belongings are, practically living there.  So, the spirit of Amelia's husband was never really gone.

She has had to put on a strong face for her son who believes he was the cause of his fathers death and trying to hide her inner thoughts to society so nobody realizes that she is falling apart inside. The brilliancy of the movie comes in that the monster is not destroyed; he simply becomes a part of their life. Everybody is human and it is impossible to expect someone to completely forget a horrific image or a hard time in his or her life. It is better to instead move on from the situation. By thinking about how it has impacted your life and how you can transition from it is a better, less volatile solution.

You see, The Babadook is a movie not about a monster, but about The Monster Inside All Of Us.  It is, essentially,  a movie about a woman whose life is on a permanent downward spiral and doesn't have the willpower to cope with it, exacerbated by the fact that her young son is a holy terror in need of discipline and, probably, psychotropic medication.  The movie is about her unwillingness to smack the little ankle biter when he goes sideways (which is all the time) and so for every screaming, clingy, wall-eyed fit he throws she takes another step towards visiting her friend Mr. Insanity.

This is presented to us by exposing us to his episodes ad nauseum---the idea being that we, too, will want to kill the tyke. Of course, the real monsters in life are Mommy and Daddy.  This is The Big Idea that takes the long way round in getting here.

But the problem is, if you have a character-driven narrative, you have to have characters that are tolerable.  The kid is deeply annoying---while this is The Point, it makes us want the top-hatted ghoul that was promised to us whisk him away into a shadowed closet, never to return.  The mother is impossible to relate to, because she is a weak willed shell of a character whose only response to crisis is to lash out in unspeakable ways.  While protagonists don't necessarily have to be good, or even likeable, they do have to be sympathetic.  The director bypasses this sympathy for a single-minded idea that she bashes us over the head with repeatedly, assuming that we're somehow going to like them more because they band together against a common enemy---drum roll---themselves.

I understand that critics can go easy on a first-timer, which director Jennifer Kent is.  The movie is beautifully shot, with angles and lighting that would have taken advantage of better material.  The Babadook book is neat, too.  But, in this era of political correctness, I can practically visualize a room full of critics nodding their heads and applauding at The Big Idea.  After all, nobody is going to criticize a movie that attempts to show child abuse as a real terror, which it absolutely is.  The real horror of child abuse is that it stems from those who should be the protectors and providers.  Who could disagree with that?

I'm not going to lie; I figured out what the Babadook was almost immediately. (Even though what you do see of him looks like Marilyn Manson as a chimney sweep.)  Nothing in this movie came as a surprise which, for me, made it an exercise in patience.  Perhaps this, too, was The Big Idea.

But the thing that bothers me the most about The Babadook is that its director has no problems placing her characters in a situation that is just ambiguous enough to fool some into thinking that it has elements of the supernatural.  If that is the case, then her entire point is lost; a supernatural being can be fought, even defeated, and a disturbed mind can be healed.  But to place them in between, with no definitive answer, The Big Idea of child abuse being The Real Horror is treated it as something that people---the director included--- lack the courage to pin down and face with real conviction.  Child abuse is not a monster that can be hit over the head, and in a modern era of medicine where mental illness is criminally undertreated, to compare it to or even hint that it is such skirts dangerously close to Facebook-era egotism.  The director could have made a monster, or she could have made a psychopath.  Instead, like so many who refuse to stand behind their actions, she made excuses.

To me, that is far scarier than any Babadook.",1427500800,5,3936,4.651230101302461
6702837,5,B00O20UHDO,"I don't want to say it's misleading to market this as a creature feature, but it's more about the horrors of parenting. The mother in this film is at wit's end, with a child who has no ""off"" switch and constantly reminds her of the husband she lost on the way to giving birth. Not since ""Candyman"" have I seen such a fantastic twisting of perception. Is everything happening inside her mind? Is the Babadook a manifestation of her psychotic break?

The worried mom already overwhelmed by the creative brain of her son decides to throw out the book but it returns. No matter how she disposes of the book, it returns and strange things start occurring in their household.

The camerawork is shocking. It is rude, like a roller coaster it sinks you into one scene and then another while your heart is still reeling from the sound effects and visuals of a previous scene. After a very long time, such a refreshing horror has been infused and needless to say The Babadook is the best horror I saw last year.

6702875,5,B00O20UHDO,"What filmmaking is all about?

Truly a frightening modern classic. Old school brilliance of tension and darkened frights. Original and unique one of a kind story, acting, atmosphere and conclusion. I felt this film and it left a perfect impression upon me. The skill to create an emotional roller coaster of fear and simplistic frights. It bleeds the old school of horror cinema. The sounds, images and completion of the film sends the viewer back into the realm of quality film without having to use a high budget and glamor shots.

The best way to watch this movie is with the lights off. The sound up, and alone. Loved the dread, classic hair raising reality. Perfect fright and scary tone with the beauty of the simple effective way of being scary.

Possibly one of my new favorites. I felt this was a new modern classic that instantly showcases itself into a cult film setting.

Directed and written by actress Jennifer Kent. This is her first feature length film and I think she aces it in the creepy department of horror movie brilliance. Truly one of the most gifted and terrifying accomplishments in cinema.

The dark, gloomy and depressing imagery makes the film stand out. Dark grey tones. Lack of color adds to the Brothers Grimm fairy tale style reality to the story and the affective nature of imagery and noise. The performances are stunning.

Essie Davis as the mom, depressed, widowed, raising an odd child and sent into a darkened reality reminds me of perfection in acting. Her part goes up there with Piper Laurie as Margaret White. She aces the part of Amelia. Her performance stands out as being something to truly remember. She gave it her all. She aced the struggling mother. She was able to grab the viewer and make you feel her plight and spiral into an emotional ordeal of insanity and the horror taking shape around her.

6702941,5,B00O20UHDO,"This is the best horror movie I've seen in a very long time.  Like most of the best horror movies, it isn't about cheap scares. It's all subtext, although it wears it on it's sleeve. It's about a single mother who lives alone with her young son, and how both of their lives are dominated by her fear. Fear that keeps them trapped in their house together, literally trapped in the same bed together, and fear that is driving the woman out of her mind.

Don't watch the trailer before you watch it. It's a trailer that gives away too many plot points and still manages to misrepresent the film. The trailer makes it look like a cheap scarefest, but it isn't at all. This is more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. It's very derivative, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The tone and themes reminded me of Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Robert Bloch. As raw cinema, the movie's pace, blocking, and visuals reminded me of a number of other great horror films. Several scenes were overt references to The Exorcist, which is fine. Better to pay obvious tribute than steal ideas. The movie's claustrophobic feel, and the central conflict involving an unknowable outside invader, owe a lot to Alien. And some of the shots and camera work reminded me of the otherworldly aspects of the Evil Dead films without getting into those movies' campy, comic aspects.  The Babadook is nerve wracking at times, because it succeeds in pulling you into the world of the main characters.  It's the kind of film where you understand what is happening to the principles better than they do, and as you come to care about their fate, you find yourself immersed.

Best of all, the resolution is powerful, highly symbolic, entirely believable, subject to personal interpretation, and invites a second viewing with new, fresh eyes.

Most horror movies are insulting to fans of the genre. This one isn't. It feels like Jennifer Kent has made a very personal movie, here, and it's the kind of film that is likely to effect most viewers on a personal level.  Don't go into this expecting jump scenes and horror-for-the-sake-of-horror.  If you're the kind of person who enjoys Rob Zombie and Eli Roth movies, don't waste your time.  This isn't for you.  But fans of good movies in general will find a lot to praise in The Babadook.",1425254400,2,2317,4.6987654320987655

6702950,5,B00O20UHDO,"This is a movie that I'd been hearing a lot good things about, and being a big horror fan, I couldn't wait to see. This movie is truly the best horror movie in recent memory. Yes, it's better than The Conjuring, Insidious 1 and 2, Sinister, and many more fantastic recent horror movies. The characters in this movie set it apart and the scares in the movie are very well-deserved and not cheap at all. Some of the scares in this movie truly gave me full-body chills and what made them so scary is that the villain of this movie is a real thing, a product of grief and loneliness. As I said before, you really care about the mother and her son in this movie and you feel the pain that they have from losing a loved one. In all honesty, Essie Davis gives the best performance I've seen all year in this movie and one that is truly Oscar-worthy, even though it will never be considered. The young man playing her son is also magnificent as a strange and tortured little boy that you can't help but feel bad for. I really hope this movie expands to many theaters and becomes very big. The only very minor complaint I have with this movie is that the ending feels very slightly rushed in one aspect but that didn't bother me much.

It was creative and had so much more to offer when compared to your typical horror movie. I felt for the boy in this story and the mother as well, and it was truly creepy. Love the ending.

At the very least, I hoped to feel less depressed and more afraid.

SPOILER

The Babadook is more of a metaphor than a monster or an entity, in my understanding of the story. I was hoping to experience a monster film, but it turned into watching a mother neglect and abuse her son to the extend that I was tempted to turn off the film. While it was interesting, I would not have rented this title if I had known how severe the emotional abuse gets.

It is definitely both a tale of solidly crafted characters that undergo some deep emotional problems (in this case a mother still dealing with the death of her husband 7 years ago as well as being a single parent to a child traumatized by bedroom monsters, at first clearly not real) against a backdrop of horror/suspense, as well as one of those horror tales that has you wondering...was it real?

Though there is a cast of six or seven characters, the only real characters are the mother and the son. The director and writer - and the actors - do a phenomenal job of showing such a relationship both at its worst and its best, all set against the internal saga of a monster that is bedeviling the two of them. Though at first it seems this monster - if it is real! - is targeting the child, later it seems that the either the mother is targeted, or perhaps the mother is the real threat? Or is she?

It has all of the elments you look for in a good horror film. It is NOT a monster movie, which everyone makes it out to be from the trailer. It is more or a psychological thriller at its best. With a single mom struggling with and acting out boy and her trauma. Very good movie, and i would recommend it.",1424476800,,482,4.193548387096774
6703016,2,B00O20UHDO,"Everything about the movie was well done with the exception of one thing... This movie was to play on the emotion of grief but failed to establish the origin of the grief. 5 second flashbacks to faces with a bewildered look, rotating about the screen all while the camera is zoomed so far in that all you're able to see are the faces...this is during a car crash that is the catalyst for the grief but you don't see anything...by that I mean you don't know it's an accident happening, or that she's pregnant, or that anyone dies. Then all that information gets dropped on you by a child blurting it out to Australia's version of CPS in about 5 seconds. The only reason I knew what was going on during that seen was due to reading reviews and a few synopsis of the film etc... Again, everything was great except for the storytelling... and that unfortunately breaks everything else down to a beautifully done, yet completely disjointed experience.",1424476800,2,946,4.603550295857988

You can't relate to the mother at all, the kid is super annoying and honestly about five minutes into this movie i wanted them both to die. The monster of the movie, The Babadook, isn't scary at all.

You will basically sit through the worst movie ever wishing for this child to die and the only thing that really happens is that the mom kills the family dog ( which you don't really see).

The ""reveal"" of Mister Babadook was flat and left more questions than answers at the end of the movie. If he's the next big ghoul in horror, then i feel sorry for the genre. This movie is overly-hyped fluff. Rent/buy/rewatch Poltergeist, The Exorcist, The Ring or even the 1st Paranormal Activity instead. The whole ""scariest movie i've ever seen"" tag, gives this movie a lot to live up to and it falls flat. I've seen scarier and i've seen more suspenseful movies in recent years. This isn't a horror.

6703107,3,B00O20UHDO,"I just finished watching this a half hour ago after hearing about how 'groundbreaking' it was. I usually don't write reviews on movies because they are so subjective regarding what is 'good' and what is 'bad'.  For example, my friend loves Adam Sandler movies whereas I want to punch him in the face whenever he is on screen. See? Subjective.

Here's my spoiler-free review of The Babadook. It was advertised as a horror movie or monster flick, with the trailer giving me the impression this is a 'mom versus creature as she tries to keep the son safe'-style outing. This was not entirely the case. Another reviewer stated that they interpreted it as more about psychosis or mental illness, and frankly that seems more plausible upon reflection. The Babadook seemed to me to be more of a symptom or manifestation of a severe psychotic break that the mother was suffering from do to events that transpired years before the movie took place.

As a movie exploring severe mental illness with it's 'flare ups' and recessions, I think it was actually quite effective. Disturbing really. Honestly, the more I look at it in terms of a psychotic break, the more the movie elicits an uneasy, almost sick feeling. As the aforementioned 'monster under the bed' takeaway, it seemed really dull and uninspired. Fairly derivative too. So however you, the viewer, choose to interpret the plot may determine your level of enjoyment.

The interior sets were kind of cool. The house, especially at night, had a dingy blue-gray look, and seemed very minimalist. To me, it forced the characters to really be the center of attention. The actress who played the mother was quite good. She was great at appearing emotionally beaten down and really conveyed how the character was just going through the motions of her life. The other main character, her son, was one of the most obnoxious creatures I've seen on screen in quite awhile. I don't know if that was done intentionally so that the audience could sympathize with his mom always being pushed to the brink or not. All I know for sure is that if Trojan ever wanted to make an effective ad to sell condoms they should just show some scenes with that kid in it. Their stock would soar.

In short, the movie is pretty over-hyped (like so many other low-budget horror flicks), but it IS fairly disturbing if looked at under the guise of an all too plausible unchecked mental disorder. The acting is good, but the whole thing takes awhile to build up steam to the climax.",1423440000,4,2499,4.735632183908046
6703108,5,B00O20UHDO,"I think it's one of the creepiest films I've seen in the last 10 years...and there has been a lot of shlock ""horror"" out there.

Everyone thinks they can do horror...and that's why there's so much crap out there. Many film makers seem to think that all that needs to be done to 'scare' audiences is follow a simple formula:

1) keep the audience in literal darkness
2) startle them with faux-scares for half the movie until the big bad comes around
3) startle them some more with the new threat

The nature of jump scares isn't frightening...it's annoying. It's a biological response that can be simulated by having a toddler poke you with a Popsicle every few minutes...which will startle you regardless of being scared.

Babadook doesn't do this. It takes vulnerabilities and exposes them to the real world fears of whether or not we really hate our own kids...and what we might truly be willing to do to hurt them in the states of mental deterioration or disorientation. After all, I've been told by MY parents that if you haven't considered thrashing your kids before...you're probably not an actual parent...and don't worry, because my relationship with them is healthy and non-violent.

The only thing I hate about this movie is the shrieking kid...but I believe that's deliberate.

6703121,5,B00O20UHDO,"Amelia struggles daily with her existence as a single mom after her husband was killed in a car accident just before she gave birth to her only son, Sam. He has quite an imagination, creating monsters out of thin air to battle with homemade weapons and shriek in terror from before bed. His over the top and obnoxious behavior goes unchecked and, along with her struggle to cope with daily life, alienates most of the people in her life. Her son finds a book called The Babadook that frightens him and he becomes even more obsessed with alternately fighting the monster and being debilitated by fear because of the monster. His behavior reaches an unacceptable level and Amelia is simply at a loss. Her life is rapidly unraveling before her eyes and then she starts to think the Babadook might actually be real.

The Babadook is an amazing directorial debut that takes a powerful emotion and portrays it in a horrific and uncomfortable way. On the surface, Samuel is an insufferably annoying child and Amelia is a complacent mother, but there is so much going on beneath the surface. Even though seven years have passed since her husband's death, Amelia has not properly dealt with her grief. This manifests at first in normal, but unhealthy ways. Amelia is obviously completely miserable in almost every aspect of her life. Her relationship with her son is extremely strained on both ends. She constantly pushes her son away because he is entwined so much with her grief. His arrival into the world was marred by her husband's very violent death which she witnessed. Sam is a constant physical reminder of her loss and what she could have had if her husband had lived. Amelia's simultaneously loves her son and resents him for surviving instead of her husband. This also causes guilt that she isn't what a mother should be or feel how a mother should feel. To cope with her feelings, she shuts everything about her husband away and just pretends he never existed, even opting to skip celebrating her son's birthday. She never acknowledges her feelings to anyone including her son who shares the same grief.

Amelia's approach to her grief makes it impossible for anyone to connect with her. Her son works through his grief by being inappropriate: clinging to her as tight as possible, telling anyone who will listen about his dead father, being prone to loud and violent outbursts, and finally personifying their problems with the Babadook and attempting to save them by creating homemade weapons. Children are quite clever and he senses her resentment on some level which leads to the over the top clingy behavior. It only serves to reaffirm the cycle of Amelia's resentment and she pushes him away even more. In the first half of the film, Sam is insufferable and I feel so much for Amelia, but he is only trying to work through his own grief without any help. During the second half of the film, the roles reverse. Amelia's behavior becomes dangerous and erratic while Sam becomes the one simply struggling to survive. He becomes sweet and meek instead of the screaming hellion he was before, making Amelia's abuse all the more disturbing. Amelia also has problems connecting with other adults. Her friends are tired of her attitude and feel she should have been over it since it was seven years ago. Her son's behavior puts people in general off including random strangers, her best friend, and her coworkers. Her only lifeline is her kindly neighbor, but even that is severed once the Babadook shows up.

You might have noticed that I haven't mentioned the title character up until this point. This is because the Babadook is the personification of Amelia's grief. The specter is invisible at first and dismissed as another of Sam's games. As Sam's birthday and the anniversary of her husband's death grows closer, the Babadook's appearance and effects become stronger and stronger. Its first appearance is in a twisted children's book found in Amelia's house. The art is gorgeous and macabre, reminiscent of Edward Gorey. The story has Amelia killing her dog, her child, and then herself. One of the lines in the book is ""You can't get rid of the Babadook."" Since it's grief, there really is no escaping it. It's simply part of you and just going through the motions in life isn't always enough to overcome it. The creature is superbly done because we get glimpses of it here and there without too much or too little exposure.

The Babadook is tense and uncomfortable to watch right from the beginning. Essie Davis perfectly portrays Amelia's loving nature through her frustration, desperation, depression, and powerlessness. Noah Wiseman acts completely insufferable through the first half of the film and then manages to still have the viewers' sympathy during the second half. Jennifer Kent, the director and writer, has crafted this frighteningly relatable and thought provoking story that could happen to any one of us. To me, that's what makes the film viscerally frightening. The cinematography and music are on point and perfectly support the mood. I am eager to see more from Jennifer Kent and I consider this film my favorite of 2014.",1423094400,3,5151,4.876712328767123

What a miserable mistake.  This was a little over an hour and a half of tired cliches and a collage consisting of pieces of other movies pitifully woven together.  There was not a single scare in the movie, not even a jump or flinch of any sort.

Speaking of Saturday mornings, this was even less scary than a good episode of ""Goosebumps"" or ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" and honestly, I really wanted to like this film, I like the premise but that's where it ends.

The scripting is raw, repetitious, amateurish and unpolished.  If it were shorter, it might make a workmanlike student film.

Every poor horror film requires most or all of these elements.

A cute, shaggy pet dog.  Preferably white.

An insect infestation.

A concerned, genuine and mild-mannered  neighbour or work colleague of the opposite sex.

Ludicrously severe government officials.

Contemptuous police.

An unnaturally large, unnaturally dark house, the topography of which is unclear.  Curtains, a basement, stairs and lamp-lit corners are mandatory.

A large-eyed, unsmiling child making unsettling appearances in odd places, arms straight at the sides.

A struggling single mother who fights oh-so-fiercely against the cruel world which abuses her  troubled darling and which  treats her badly because she is poor.  Poor, but like a she-bear, you hear!

Something odd coming out of a major character's mouth.

Cuts of scarey old black and white cartoons and films.

Shots of a large tree.

Vulnerable child being bullied to breaking point by another child while adults are engaged in serious conversation.

Someone shoots backwards up the stairs.

A character slams a door shut against something scarey and shuffles backwards across the floor on their haunches.

The emotions weave back and forth as she copes with loving, yet holding her son responsible for her husband's death, allbeit unjustly.  With the Babadook representing her pent up emotional rage and frustration, she must come to grips with the loss and tame the Babadook that resides not in her house, but within herself.  This is a wonderfully frightening psychological ""fairy tale"" that moves very deliberately as the viewer tries to put the pieces together.  I am not surprised by the reviews listed here.  The babdook is no Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween.  No, it is much more thought provoking and internally satisfying.

6703131,5,B00O20UHDO,"The best horror movies are the ones that don't just fling gore in your face, but find a way to tap into some primal fear or dark emotion that we hide out of sight.

And that dark, ragged core is what powers ""The Babadook,"" a hauntingly eerie movie that becomes outright terrifying as it progresses, following a young single mother's descent into a living nightmare. Director Jennifer Kent dances on the fine line between psychological horror and the supernatural, slowly building up the sense of creeping horror as the Babadook slowly takes over the mother's life.

Ever since the sudden death of her husband (while driving her to the hospital to deliver their son), has been struggling to raise her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone while working full time. Samuel is a rather troubled child -- he rarely sleeps, often has screaming tantrums and clashes with other children. Even worse, he's building homemade weapons to ward off imaginary monsters, which eventually gets him suspended from school.

Then, one night she reads him a disturbing pop-up book about a monster called The Babadook. This book makes Samuel act even more erratically, disturbing others with his stories about the Babadook, so Amelia destroys the book... only to have it reappear, with new pages that show the Babadook coming from INSIDE her, and graphically show her killing her dog, her son, and finally herself. Also, the pages bleed.

And in the days that follow, the horror of the Babadook comes closer. Creepy phone calls. Beetles in the walls. Glass in the food. A strange figure lurking in the shadows, watching them and scuttling like an insect on the ceiling. Amelia's sanity begins to unravel, as do her conflicting feelings for her son, as she finds that she can't get away from the Babadook...

""The Babadook"" has a sort of visceral creepiness, preying on every fear you've had in the night -- fear of what lurks in the shadows. There is something behind the door, in the hall outside your bedroom, scuttling over the ceiling, screeching at you in a hoarse, froglike voice. It's a giant shadow with a perpetually yawning maw, a top hat and giant blank eyes. It will erupt from inside you, turning you into a dead-eyed moppet as it ""wears your skin""

But the nightmarish quality goes deeper, into the symbolic. The Babadook is grief. The Babadook is depression. The Babadook is every ugly, twisted, vile feeling that you hide away inside, festering until it tears its way out. In short, the most horrifying thing about the Babadook is that he isn't just some spectral bogeyman who can be repulsed somehow. He comes from the darkest human emotions -- and if they are repressed, they fester and grow into something truly nightmarish. Those emotions are very real, and very dangerous.

And it's even more nightmarish because we see it in both the main characters. He even looks like a huge, monstrous parody of Samuel -- large eyes, top hat, wide mouth. And as Amelia finally faces down the Babadook, we see her shadow slowly transform into the murky silhouette glimpsed in the book.

This is the first full-length movie Jennifer Kent has made, and she knows how to fill you with dread. She veils the entire movie in pale, ghostly light, which serves to make both Amelia and Samuel look ethereal and almost ghostly. It also makes the pitch-black shadows even deeper, including the occasional glimpse of the Babadook. The house transforms into a gothic carnival, and seemingly mundane scenes like Amelia watching TV become absolutely freakish.

And the final half hour is a single long nightmare, as Amelia goes on a rampage --  she murders the dog, screeches like a banshee, and tells her son, ""You little pig... you don't know how many times I wished it was you, not him, that DIED!"" Even when Samuel retaliates with ""Home Alone""-style booby-traps and attacks, the the experience utterly harrowing. And at times, you can't tell if there is something supernatural at work, or whether Amelia is simply going mad.

Essie Davis is an absolute revelation as Amelia -- she conveys all the frazzled, desperate impatience of a woman whose life is barely holding together. She's sexually frustrated, sleep-deprived, lonely and has to deal with the constant judgement of moms with easier lives. Her pale pixie face and wispy blonde hair make her even more frightening as we see Amelia's eyes grow empty and her actions become erratic... and then fill with strength when she finally confronts the Babadook.

In that sense, she's well-paired with Noah Wiseman -- he has the look of a changeling child, with large shadowed eyes, a pale face, a mop of curly hair and and a wide mouth. He's very good at being annoying in a normal kid way (kicking the seat while screeching), and in the final quarter we also glimpse Wiseman's skill at playing a kid who has clearly guessed his mother's tangled feelings about him, but who loves her nevertheless.

You can't get rid of the Babadook, but ""The Babadook"" mingles skin-crawling, visceral horror with a glimpse of the darkness that can fester in a person's soul. The most sublime horror movie for a long, long time, and the herald of three substantial talents.",1422748800,14,5172,4.8569807037457435

I'd been waiting for months to see this film and finally got my chance last weekend. I paid my $8.00, turned out the lights and sat back awaiting this ""Horror Masterpiece"".

The film was shot very beautifully with a certain quality that would lend to the forthcoming creep-fest. The mother gained my sympathy right away as I could tell she was suffering. Her child, on the other hand, was overly annoying to the point of me wanting to mute my sound system. More or less the child came across as a sufferer, much like his mother.

The film drug along, but I figured it was building tension for the big moment.
The book shows up out of the blue. No back story, no explanation. The mom reads it to the kid and supposedly the terror begins. Supposedly.
Once you finally get to see the aggressors' character, it's a downer. A white painted face, black around his overly largemouth in a black top hat and coat. If you saw ""Sinister"" and remember the moment when you saw the ghoul; that was creepy. Seeing the Babadook for the first time was less than that.

The film literally drags on and it appears the mom is being possessed by the Babadook. Her attitude changes and the kid is scared of her. The Babadook shows up a couple of times here and there. She gets a spooky (and predictable) phone call. I noticed at this point the side of my face was numb from sitting in the same position with my cheek resting on my fist; waiting for something to gather my interest to make me shift uncomfortably in my seat.

By the time we get some kind of a clue as to what's going on, the movie was just about at an end. She killed the family dog which was illustrated in the ""I have no idea why this is here"" book. Supposedly she is to kill her son next in her psychotic possessed state. The kid stabs her in the leg and runs off.

Mayhem ensues and the Babadook comes out of the shadows to claim either the kid or her or both. She yells that he's trespassing in her house. The Babadook is apparently scared and powerless against trespassing in a home, so it retreats to the basement and all is well again.

Next we see them digging up worms in the backyard, throwing them in a bowl and mommy taking it down to the basement for the Babadook to dine upon. The end.

Here's my problem: When a film is marketed as ""Truly Frightening"", ""Very creepy"" or ""...rivals The Conjuring"" - I expect the films to be just that. This film was NOT a horror movie... not even accidentally. It was NOT scary, frightening or made me lose sleep. If anything this was a thriller with a horribly executed plot. That would be the ""horror"".

There's no explanation of the Babadook, its origin or what its purpose really is. We assume it's to prey upon a weak soul (mom) to break her down and give him the child. That's what I got out of it, at a minimum.

I felt the plot was seriously lacking in detail and the two characters were over-developed while the Babadook was underdeveloped. The acting was very well done, but that's about the only strength of the movie.

So let's review and see if I got this right:

Mom is in a 7 year depression after losing her husband on the way to the hospital to have her son. Check.
Said son is a handful to care for. Check.
Said son also likes magic tricks and bedtime stories. Check.
Mom gets tired of the kid sleeping in her bed where she cannot even masturbate without interruption. Check.
One night she reads the Babadook book and things start to happen. Check.
Family ties severed by moms' depression. Check.
Kid remains highly unruly. Check.
Babadook shows up and spits some goo in moms mouth to possess her (*cough* The Conjuring).
Mom goes after the kid, kills the dog, kid stabs mom in the leg and runs off. Check.
Mom chases kid to her room, Babadook shows up and she reminds him that he's trespassing in her home. Check.
Babadook screams and hides in the basement. Check.
Babadook is now a supernatural pet that eats garden worms from a bowl. Gotcha.",1422576000,14,3974,4.391836734693878

6703146,2,B00O20UHDO,"I watched this because of a friend's glowing review of how scary it was. I was waiting to be scared. After seeing it I only saw a woman's mental breakdown caused by years of struggling with loss and dealing with a troubled son. The Babadook didn't strike me as an actual monster, but a representation of Amelia's inner demons. One she needed to face and conquer to save her sanity so she doesn't hurt her son. I'm still not sure if I'm right about this. If it is just a boogie man and I'm thinking too deeply then let it stand as proof of how bored I was.

This movie was unsettling because this kind of scenario and mental collapse are real. It isn't horror, more of a psychological-thriller and not a great one either, just OK. I saw what they were trying to do. The two leads are social pariahs in a unfeeling, pretentious world.  But I still had little sympathy or empathy for the Amelia character. Especially after hearing it's been 7 years past the event and seeing that a number of characters showing genuine concern for her and her son only for her to either reject them outright because she can handle it when she clearly can't or lashes out at them. I thought her son was amazingly mind numbing, to the point were I almost stopped watching, which made sense later after seeing what an inattentive and terrible parent Amelia is. Even after she is ""better"" I felt like she is still unstable and clings to Samuel because he is a living piece of her husband. If the Babadook is her inner demon, this works, it's still there and she continues to struggle with those old feelings. The minute she losses control of it is when she'll got back into a murderous rampage again. I was too frustrated with the characters to care.

TL:DR Not scary but pretty meh movie. I did not like it and felt more sympathy for the dog than any other character. I probably read way too deeply into it. Even if it was more of a character study I didn't find it all that interesting. Did not live up to the hype.
The Babadook won't keep me up at night, there's a good chance that I will forget this movie in a few months.",1422316800,14,2102,4.343511450381679

6703149,5,B00O20UHDO,"""The Babadook"" is one of the most effective horror films made in some time.  Australian actress Essie Davis' performance as Amelia, a slowly deteriorating single mother of little Samuel (played by the buggy, ""Omenish"" child actor Noah Weismann) is Oscar worthy.

Her husband died in a particularly ugly way: driving Amelia to the hospital while she was in labor with Samuel.  This, of course, is cause for all manner of psychic malfunction in a familial context.  Suffice it to say that director  Mike Flanagan uses this.  And then some.

Some of the scenes exploit everyday ailments and occurrences (fatigue, loud noises, the occasional inability to sleep) to heroically awful effect.  Amelia's physical transformation, from a sort of Bumpkinish British female with a slight charm to a raw skinned, purplish eyed, acne ridden and slightly terrifying woman is almost as scary as the premise of the film--that young Samuel has brought home a tale named entitled ""The Babadook"" of which the text reads: ""If it's in a word. Or it's in a look. You can't get rid of ... The Babadook"".  That a phrase or a quote from anywhere can drive an already hyper stressed person half-out-their-minds is given ample display as both mother and child experience hallucinations, are visited by the CPS on the wise advice of their kindly old neighbor, and finally, without ruining anything, assault each other with such deadly acumen (witness Samuel's crossbow that shoots darts and Mommy's favorite butcher knife) that, really, the only thing left to do is work things out with the Babadook. (I loved the hallucinated commercial with ""Carnival of Souls"".)

The thing that's misunderstood about this movie is m e t a p h o r.  Why is it so hard to understand everything on the screen may, in fact, not always be happening? I think this and ""Sinister"" deserve a nomination. Recommended.",1422230400,3,1864,4.961414790996785
6703150,5,B00O20UHDO,"There is much more here than just a terrifying and edgy horror movie.  Essie Davis' character is seven years past the death and birth of her son.  She literally and figuratively hides her past grief, joy, and angst in the basement.  She is a poor Mum' not coping very well with everything, work, personal life, and feels encumbered in every way by her son's fixation on the macabre and penchant for grating behavior.  The set up for this movie is perfect.  Essie Davis' character is a volcano.  She is rife with emotions, but perfunctorily goes about her day never dealing with the emotional monsters within.  Never admitting.  Never addressing the tragedy, never resolving, just living in it's aftermath without resilience.  Enter stage right--the Babadook.  As a child I had my share of eating up morbid childhood books, but ""The Babadook,"" well it takes the cake.  While looking like a scary children's book, it ends up being terrifying.  Eerily portraying beset characters that look just like Sam and Amelia. ((Spoilers)) The Babadook gains strength from denial.  Sam realizes it for what it is, and hates it.  The Babadook is here and he isn't that pleasant imaginary friend that some 7 year olds may have.  Amelia addresses it as some grotesque alternative imaginary friend her son has dream up, but this insidious and relentless ""playmate"" is anything but.  Amelia denies it's existence, but the more she denies the more strained, drained, and beset she becomes.  Until the Babadook starts ""to eat"" her insides, just how Amelia has been beset and eaten up by all her past tragedy, never addressing always skating over her troubles until she is totally consumed.  Any healthy person, emotionally speaking, has to admit their problems their worries before they can deal with it.  Like the Babadook, Amelia's problems only worsen with time the more she denies and goes about her business as if nothing is wrong.  This is a very thoughtful and intelligent horror movie.  I cannot think of any horror movie period that even comes close to it's metaphorical dimension.  It's clever, always unnerving from it's faded colors and old house, and absolutely terrifying.  Just remember, ""You can't get rid of the Babadook!"" but you should certainly deal with him, unless you want your insides eaten.",1422230400,7,2294,4.994722955145119

Once summoned, it initially possesses the mother leading to her becoming a monster of sorts, treating her son badly and hurting the family pet. This continues throughout the movie, this problematic mix of the ""good"" mother and the Babadook mother which controls her dark thoughts and feelings.

Babadook could have easily been an Insidious level thriller but it goes beyond while dealing with the grief of a lost spouse and a child that is unable to fit in to a normal behavior style or life.

6703179,4,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook (which, fun fact, is an anagram of ""a bad book"") is a really effective Australian horror film, and I say that as someone who's pretty jaded with the genre. Sure, movies like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist are great, but for every one of those, there seems to be a dozen films along the lines Saw and Hostel: poorly written, laughably acted, and completely scare-free. Based on the sky-high critical ratings for The Babadook, I decided to keep an open mind and check it out, and my desire to see it was cemented further when I read that William Friedkin (who directed The Exorcist) said, ""I've never seen a more terrifying film than The Babadook."" After finally watching this film, Jennifer Kent's first (!) feature film (based on her own short film, The Monster), I must say that as much as I love Public Enemy, this is the rare case where people should believe the hype; this movie is excellent.

Kent's film is truly tense and suspenseful, and just as Polanski did in Rosemary's Baby, Kent gives the viewer a really sharp insight into the increasingly distorted and claustrophobic mind of her protagonist Amelia (Essie Davis, giving one of 2014's best performances), a widow who is raising a troubled young son, Robbie, who has difficulty sleeping and is fearful of imaginary monsters. Like most great horror films, the brilliance lies not in the plot but in how the plot is executed; one's reaction to a horror film is highly dependent on how scary one finds it, and this film truly scared me, far more than cheap, manipulative, and exploitative fare like Paranormal Activity, because this is an infinitely smarter and more psychologically rich piece of filmmaking.

I honestly can't think of an American horror film from the last decade or so that I would compare to this film. It's closer, at least in tone, to something like Lars von Trier's Melancholia, in that it brilliantly comments on the traumatic effects depression can have not just on those suffering from it, but on those witnessing it from the sidelines, as well; the emotional collateral damage loved ones often face when a family member is mentally ill is not brushed under the rug in this film as it is in so many others, and I love that. This is not a particularly subtle film, but it's powerful and rings painfully true for anyone who has dealt with mental health problems. After watching The Babadook, Friedkin's comments no longer seem hyperbolic; perhaps Psycho and Les Diaboliques are a little more frightening, but not by much.

If I have one criticism, it's that I'm not sure how I feel about the ending; it's not bad, but it felt a bit anticlimactic to me, at least after an initial viewing. I don't want to spoil anything, and I will revisit it in due time. Though I don't regard it as a perfect film, The Babadook is both the smartest and scariest horror film I've seen in some time and I highly recommend it.",1421712000,8,2905,4.692156862745098

The impending doom in a horror movie is caused by the 'threat' of the thing/monster/spirit/whatever - and while the Babadook seems to be messing with their lives effectively, it just sort of stands there and pops its hands out.

Along with Housebound I'd rank this as the major disappointment of 2014. For all the hype this film has received, The Babadook adds up to what would be an above average psychological drama on the Lifetime channel. In other words, this is not a horror film. Over-used tropes abound (they actually re-use a few within the film) and it makes me wonder if people who praise this flick have ever seen any other horror films, or, horror films are so bad now that anything that shows an inkling of originality is considered great.

I'm happy to report that I wasn't the least bit let down.
  First, forget about all of the ""Scariest movie ever made!"" blurbs. It seems like we've seen that tag line attached to everything from Paranormal Activity (excellent AND scary) to the remake of Evil Dead (overblown, dull). When one hears praise like that, one expects to be screaming in sheer terror for 90 minutes along with a packed theater of teenagers. The Babadook is, without question, very frightening...but in a very different way than American audiences have come to expect. (The Babadook is Australian, which partially explains the goofy, off-putting title).
  The creators of this film clearly challenged themselves: How can we make a truly terrifying movie without one single 'Gotcha!' scene? There's no t one scene in the film that relies on shock value, or the 'jump-out'. The Babadook is truly horror as an art form, using storytelling and technique as opposed to mindless tittilation.

6703208,5,B00O20UHDO,"Loss: a reckless cyclone that unleashes a flash flood of destructive emotions. It is not planned, foreseen or expected, but we will all inevitably face it in our lifetime.

Such is the theme of The Babadook, a 2014 Australian horror film directed by Jennifer Kent. It is inarguably the best horror film in recent memory, and I don't use that phrase lightly, much less use it often.

Essie Davis plays Amelia, a mother still grieving years after the death of her husband. She struggles to survive everyday life, trying to keep her erratically disturbed son, Samuel, under control and out of trouble.

After finding a childrens book titled Mister Babadook about a child-eating monster, things begin to worsen when Samuel starts to believe the monster wants to kill him.

Grappling with a toxic miasma of insomnia, trauma, anger and a potential mental breakdown, Amelia starts questioning whether shes going further down into the mouth of madness or if the abomination actually exists.

Its a burden not even Atlas himself could bear.

To say The Babadook deserves the aforementioned title  see: best horror film  is to say that the color of a black Labrador is, well, black. Down to every minuscule detail, to every millimeter, all of it is true in the sincerest way imaginable.

This is amplified by Essie Davis exceptionally phenomenal performance. Not a second goes by where the ominous aura that envelopes her ceases to create a palpable, unmerciful sense of nerve-wracking tension in your stomach.

Not totally reliant on Davis acting prowess, the film boasts an impressive cast of characters with their own distinct, multi-dimensional personalities, in addition to a unique and terrifying monster with a powerful, overbearing presence.

You know what, upon further inspection, I noticed a typo when I wrote that The Babadook is the best horror film in recent memory. Allow me to rephrase:

The Babadook is one of the best movies to be released in recent memory.

6703218,4,B00O20UHDO,"[One particular bababook, anyway...]

This clever little Australian film never threatens to fall into the pit of mediocrity where all Hollywood formula-horror rots away, deftly catching itself after every minor misstep. The powerful visuals of the titular bababook, by Alex Juhasz, are recreated convincingly -- but sparingly, evidence of directorial maturity and restraint -- with CGI. The design and macabre tone of the story within the story feels remarkably familiar, like you've read it before; 'The Babadook' is equal parts Edward Gorey, Dr. Seuss, Tim Burton and Neil Gaiman, with a bit of Maurice Sendak. I was almost certain I'd confronted the book myself, albeit with less traumatic results.

Writer-director Jennifer Kent leaves the Babadook where it's power is always in the ascendant: the shadows. Top hats and black raven wing-tips hint at horrors within horrors, and the nightmares she unveils just point you toward something so much worse. At its core, this is an allegorical tale about loss, guilt, blame, and suffering. It's about the nasty thoughts that fester and swell in the cellar of the mind, the thoughts that can become dangerous if we let them.

The two actors who made this film work so well were Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman. Wiseman, a boy of 8 or so, is incredible. Kent knew what she was getting herself into with this film, giving 40 minutes of screen-time to an 8-year-old. She obviously had faith in her own ability to work with kids, and to find the right boy for the job. I don't think it's a 'Sixth Sense'-level performance, but it's pretty impressive. Davis deserves even higher praise, putting her heart and soul into a small production that might have languished in obscurity. She's a very talented actress... and if this were an American film, she wouldn't have been given an audition. It would have been Kiera Knightley, or Jessica Chastain, both great actresses, but... it wouldn't have been the same.. Again, great story and performances, highly recommended.

P.S.: 'If it's in a word/Or it's in a look/You can't get rid/Of the Babadook' -- in a slightly amazing convergence of creepy Australian death-book films and sub-par computing technology, after posting this review, I moved on to the many wondrous online-carnivals-of-the-mind that sparkle like diamonds in the cyber-desert. I noticed through my Quaalude-fog that a few bits and bytes were ghosting through on every page, and I kid you not, it was just two words: 'the Babadook'. It wasn't just bleeding through my internet browser, it was on my desktop. And no matter what I tried, I couldn't 'get rid of the Babadook'. Scary. Or at least annoying, since a restart worked. I wish I wasn't an atheist... then I could have taken it as proof of life beyond... well, something vaguely spiritual, I guess; instead, it's just a sign that my glitchy laptop is getting glitchier.

""You can't get rid of the Babadook.""

All that being said, if you are into slasher films or grotesque horror, this film is not for you.  Mister Babadook is a brilliantly conceived and genuinely frightening character.

He wanted his mom to have his back and he hers so far all good things. She chooses to read him a different book one night and the pages become more sinister as she flips through and she scares him and herself and she knows when they hear a knock then will come the Babadook.

The Babadook what he see of it is not that impressive and we never really find out what its true intentions were, or were the book came from.

 This is a movie about a woman's psychosis and how her illness affects her son.  The ""Babadook"" is actually how the son has decided to cope with his mother's psychotic behavior.  And yes she does try to kill him (she kills the family dog during one of her episodes).

Toward the end she traps the ""badadook"" in her basement (i.e. she contains that part of her) and then begins feeding it so as to keep it away from her and her son (i.e. her psychosis has receded temporarily).

The child is neglected and abused throughout the film.

6703306,4,B00O20UHDO,"In relative terms of small budget foreign indie, actors and director unknown to me, more psychological horror than violent creature feature, this is my favorite contemporary horror movie in years. Likely made on a small budget, the mostly rudimentary practical effects, some of which are quite flawed, aren't the movie's scare tactic. The movie works on a psychological level to incite an emotional investment through sympathy, impatience, claustrophobia, confusion and tension. The connection with the characters elevates the stakes and the plot builds tension right through to the epilogue. That couldn't happen without the stellar performance of Essie Davis. I haven't seen a performance this deep in the genre since Ellen Burstyn in The Exorcist. (No character comparison, they are not the same mothers. AN AUSSIE STAR IS BORN IN THE USA!) Her exhausted, emotionally drained, single mother devoted to an emotionally needy child she is struggling to love is a complex role that she pulls off. One night the bedtime story choice is a mysterious pop-up book with a story that goes from something on the level of the Big Bad Wolf to being much more sinister. (Her reading the book is a great scene as she slowly realizes where the story she is reading to her child is going.) All hell slowly breaks loose as the warnings from the book begin to happen. Her nuanced sympathetic characterization of a woman and mother on the verge adds important dimension to her evolution through the film. The connection to story and character creates the buy in you'll need to give a pass to some of the effects and for things that could otherwise seem a little kooky. The child actor was just OK but was used quite well to portray the troubled character. Overall the film showcases the artistry in the production from color palette, shot composition, scene construction, sound and editing. Even some cliche camera tricks, sound effects and cutaway shots are well used and made logical. There are a few images that feel inserted just to be disturbing, but it is that kind of movie. Those who need their horror full of violence, gore, or a lot of monster imagery might be disappointed. It's sparse by contemporary standards; so is the movie -and to its credit. Uptick to 4 stars for great layered story telling, acting, pace, and overall artistry with the material. Downtick to 4 stars for unoriginal or unnecessary elements & and a few messy practical special effects.",1420416000,2,2451,4.951456310679611

6703323,5,B00O20UHDO,"As I stated in the title, I hate horror movies and usually avoid them like the plague. My family and friends are always trying to coerce me into watching scary movies, but I'm always stubborn and resistant. One day, I saw some images of the children's book that is featured in the movie and, being an artist with an illustrative eye, I was intrigued. I watched the trailer and found myself thinking: ""Wow, this looks really interesting..."" I definitely surprised my mom when I showed her the trailer and expressed my desire to see it.

So far, I've seen it twice. I definitely want to add the movie to my collection when it comes out on DVD, which is astonishing even to myself. I didn't really find The Babadook scary in the traditional sense. There are no jump scenes, there is very little blood and gore, and the movie doesn't rely on the monster all that much. However, The Babadook is possibly one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen. In addition to creepy, it's surreal, dream-like, intriguing, and surprisingly insightful. I liked that I was able to find both literal and metaphorical meaning in it. I liked that it focused on themes of grief, depression, and recovery. The characters are relatable and three-dimensional, and I definitely found myself rooting for them. I liked that the movie didn't use the monster as a gimmick; the monster is shadowy, sinister, nightmarish, and almost has a Tim Burton feel to it.

Personally, I liked the ending, though I thought it could have been executed a little better.  Just my humble opinion. The tension and suspense throughout the rest of the story is unrelenting and oftentimes unsettling. The Babadook had me enthralled from start to finish, and it seeped deeper into my mind and under my skin the more that time passed. This movie stayed with me for awhile, and it had me checking closets and glancing over my shoulder for a few days. Also, I have enjoyed sneaking around corners and saying ""Baba-dook-dook-DOOK!"" to freak out my mom. It gets her every time.",1420329600,3,2017,4.7407407407407405

6703357,3,B00O20UHDO,"Those expecting a suspenseful ghost story will likely be disappointed. This film works just as well when viewed as the story of a woman gradually descending into paralyzing depression and then rage as the result of a family tragedy. Essie Davis is initially sympathetic as Amelia, the mother of Samuel (Noah Wiseman), a child with severe behavioral problems. But Amelia gradually becomes almost unrecognizable as the film progresses, and the resulting psychological and physical abuse she inflicts upon her son is not so much scary as it is alternately tedious and distressing to watch. The Babadook, a terror birthed by a child's book, is supposedly the cause of Amelia's transformation, but this being is only fleetingly visible, making it very difficult for the audience to see much beyond the character of an abusive mother.  Better would have been to have had mother and son battling together against Evil and coming out in a better place. A clich, maybe, but much more satisfying than the ambiguous ending we are left with. This is especially disappointing after a film which began with such a great premise. Horror fans could have used more Babadook and less Crazed Mom.",1420243200,2,1177,5.035897435897436

For me, the majority of the film's tension came from the mother's slowly increasing isolation from others and the steady decay of her mental state.

6703376,5,B00O20UHDO,"This was a really interesting movie, and is an incredibly impressive debut film from the director. I loved how the whole movie, even the end where they show you one thing, could all be taken multiple different ways. It's been done before, but Babadook is possibly the most successful at keeping you guessing the entire way through. The actors, especially the mother and son which are really on the screen for the entire movie are great. The kid is incredibly annoying and weird, but that's exactly what the movie called for. It's impressive for the actor and the director to make the viewers almost want the kid to be punished, he could possibly even be called a villain for a decent part of this movie. The mother is also excellent, she does really well portraying someone descending into madness, or possession. I'll try to avoid any spoilers, but once the film is over, I couldn't help but spend time thinking about everything that happened, and what it actually meant.

The movie was just so well done, and it expects so much from the viewer, it isn't dumbed down at all, it knows/expects that the people who watch the Babadook will be intelligent. Lately, almost every horror film has some sort of exposition dump, where the people google search, go to the library, or ask an expert about what's happening. However, there is nothing like that in this film. On one side it makes it so that the viewer and the characters in the story have no idea what the source is of the Babadook entity that's haunting them, but on the other it opens up so many possibilities for the viewer to fill in the blanks on their own. Personally, btw this is a slight spoiler, from a random comment made during the film that said the mother used to be a writer of articles and children books before the death of her husband and birth of her son (on the same night), I think that the mother might have been the one that wrote the Babadook, and her son just found it in a box of her old stuff in the basement. If this is true it puts a much different spin on the movie, which is really backed up multiple times in the film, while simultaneously showing something completely different and supernatural. What's great is that even beyond the two main ways to view the ending, you could also take it to have a deeper meaning beyond what's showed or implied. Where essentially the movie was all about a mother coming to terms with her grief over the loss of her husband, and while it's something that never fully disappears, you can lock it up in the basement and learn to live a mostly normal life.

There aren't any jump scares in this movie or a lot of gore, it's just a really creepy and hauntingly enthralling movie, something very different from the average horror movie. I'd highly recommend the Babadook, especially for fans of psychological horror.",1420156800,6,2831,4.5599214145383105

I don't mean to offend anyone by calling it a chick flick but the film is about depression, single motherhood, and the overpowering love of a mother (spoiler alert) to overcome the uncontrollable  incidents that life throws our way.  I also think the movie overstayed its welcome by about 20 minutes.
I noticed one reviewer noted the Mom never said I love you to her son, and when I thought about it I realized they were right.  That thought made me enjoy the movie more in retrospect (illustrating the depths of the Mom's depression), but since they are selling this as a horror film I have to stick to three stars.

6703437,4,B00O20UHDO,"[SPOILER ALERT for those who want to hear nothing about anything] I've been around a while and I've seen a lot of horror movies. I haven't ""seen it all"" but I've seen a lot. So, when I watch a new one, I try to treat most familiar or derivative elements as a visit with old friends rather than a rip-off or laziness on the part of the filmmakers. That is, IF recycled elements are spun, innovated or held out as homage. The Babadook is one of those movies that repurposes some classic horror gags, to be sure  (James Wan, meet your evil twin director Jennifer Kent). The Babadook is a familiar story with a fresh and earnest face. A well-worn and simple myth about the phantom that haunts the dreams and closets of kids. But in this tale, just as chicken pox are much more painful manifested as Shingles in adults, the haunting takes on a more sinister and deadly mass when Mom is the one seeing shadows in every corner. This corpulent Australian confection is entirely self aware and let's you know it at each turn. Just as you're admiring the retro starkness of the design of the film, an Argento snippet plays on a TV. The most impressive feat is the consistent and ridiculously nuanced and extreme performances by mother and child. The best example of symbiotic concert between director and actors. As is the case in many of my personal favorites, the people are much scarier than any supernatural monster. The Babadook didn't scare me, it delighted me with it's craft and obvious love of the genre. But like I said, I've been around. It will terrify some people.",1419984000,,1567,4.556737588652482

We watch LOTS of movies. Most movies. US and international. Subtitles. We see multiple new movies every week.

This was our favorite movie of the year for sure. We watched this movie three times in one weekend. While we watch lots of movies there are not many that we re-watch like that.

We just couldn't stop talking about it and pointing things out to each other and simultaneously knew we had to re-watch. The second viewing we asked our 18 year old son to join us. He noticed things we hadn't. Later that same weekend after more discussion and reading about the director/writer (she's new) we watched it one more time.

Thanks to Amazon for having the movie available. We were upset that our local art house theaters had not shown this Australian film yet. I assume it will eventually show itself. Hope so.

The movie has too little plot for too much movie. Maybe there is a good story behind the movie. Maybe there is an actual story. I couldn't find it. If the supernatural part ended up being only contortions of the mothers mind, it would have been much better.

Don't watch while in a darkened room, or you'll spend at least the first half of the movie looking over your shoulder.  You'll find yourself searching for a shadow crawling across the ceiling, or lingering just off the edge of your peripheral vision.  The image and idea of Mr. BABADOOK has the potential to provoke nightmares.  But, this film is not really a creature feature.  The plot, direction, acting, musical score, cinematography, and pacing is flawless.  At first I thought the ending was a bit abrupt.  But I felt better about it after my 2nd viewing.

My son has autism, so dealing kindly with a sleepless, needy child has been a part of my life for years, and I think it altered my feelings for the mother character and for this movie that no one seemed capable of that.

After fifteen minutes I expected to finish this movie irate and disappointed, as I love horror and the trailer had given me chills (not an easy task), but if I can't relate to the characters in the movie then I will be distracted from fear by anger, or happiness if the hated characters die.

6703475,5,B00O20UHDO,"So says William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist, a movie that itself is found at the very top of most lists of the scariest movies ever made. It was the best reviewed movie of the holiday season per RottenTomatoes (98%), beating out Oscar contenders. It features the best children's pop-up book ... EVER! And it was probably released in less theaters than The Interview (how could this movie not have been picked up for broader distribution?!?!).

It's a story of grief, depression, and the tension/bond between a mother and child, all seamlessly weaved into an original and captivating supernatural horror flick. The performances of the mother and son are outstanding, although you'll want to strangle at least one of them in the beginning for obnoxious behavior.

The Babadook's voice freaked out my dog, who barked furiously every time it spoke, and it was fairly amusing to mess with him later by imitating it.

I didn't give it a 5-star rating on account of the movie dragging just a bit in spots, along with one of the boy's fits that seemed to be a bit over the top.  I didn't think the creature was peppered in enough, though I like the overall theme.

While i don't regret watching the movie, i felt that the appraisal of this film by so many as the ""best horror movie of 2014"" goes on woefully unearned. Or, rather, it says a lot more about this year in horror upon reflection then it does about this film itself.

The story starts off with incredible tension, you can almost see the mother aging as the burden of her sons disobedience drains upon her soul. The son does such a good job bestowing horror unto his mother that you'll wonder yourself if this is, in fact, a monster movie at all. Unfortunately, at about halfway through the film, the tension completely vanishes and you will come to realize that it is just another monster movie, and not even a particularly good one.",1419724800,3,789,4.556338028169014

If your looking for a pop up and scare you, gore centric thriller. Don't watch this. If you want to watch a well written horror film, that is slightly reminiscent (conceptually) of a Grimm fairy tale, and you want a slow build into a waking nightmare. Than this is the movie for you. Great underlying message about understanding and accepting reality, no matter how dark it can be. Enjoy the film.",1419638400,,538,4.673684210526316

The Babadook is an emotional mediation on the dual hardships of grief and motherhood, not a juvenile fright flick.

The scares the film delivers are mostly built by atmosphere and psychological approach bolstered supernatural images and themes. The deterioration of both the mother and her son's mental state as the dark force known as the Babadook terrorizes them feels believable since they are reasonably well written characters that are fully fleshed out. There aren't many scenes in this film which will make you jump out of your seat or jerk you around, but in a genre filled with such cliches that grow tiresome this is excusable. However there are some parts in this film that i feel deserve to explained a bit better a times i felt the story itself was basic but everything else was original and inventive.

Had the lights out, popcorn ready, and was ready to be scared or at least creeped out. NOTHING!! Only watch this if you can get it for free, and are already extremely bored.

The thing that was haunting you and traumatizing your child, now lives in your basement and you feed him/it worms??? WTH?!? For one...how did that even happen?

Every night, Amelia reads Sam a bedtime story and one night chooses ""The Babadook,"" a horrifying beings that haunts, that kills, that never leaves. Slowly the Babadook begans to haunt Sam and then Amelia, because Amelia doesn't believe. Sam only wants to protect his mother, Amelia only wants Sam to behave.

""The Babadook"" is a nifty horror movie for those who enjoy psychological suspense over torture porn. It's a tale of a mother and son, grappling with pain and lost, and the ramifications of not facing the reality of life head-first.

I wanted to like this movie because I really like the horror genre, but I didn't like it.  It wasn't scary to me.  I don't need to be scared with all horror films, but it has to have a sense of ""urgency"" that keeps the story going.  This one loses it, if it ever had it.  A lot like Guillermo Del Toro's films it was a rich and a well-told story. It took it's time to develop the mood and the characters.  Everything is rectified and set right in the end.  And like Del Toro, the creep factor is high (creepiness a la puppets, monsters under the bed, eerie noises), but not my type of creepiness.  I watched it at night, home alone, and I slept like a baby.  If you like Del Toro films you will find this movie a real treat.  Not what I was looking for...",1419292800,,927,4.0109289617486334

This film is, at its heart, a psychological-horror film. The film may start off a little slow for some folks. It's not a very fast-paced movie. While you're watching the film, the most important thing is to remember this is one of the those films with more than one explanation. The film doesn't necessarily hand you answers on a plate, but if you look (and you don't even have to look very hard), you will see them. Even with that being said, I believe the events surrounding the Babadook are open to interpretation beyond the most obvious explanation.

That's left for you to decide.

The descent into madness is explained through The Babadook, not the pent up feelings of the mother, making it less psychologically thrilling.

Translation: we're harder to scare these days! I remember when The Exorcist came out, I was a kid but just the ads for that movie scared the cheese out of me.  Monsters in ""Alien"" and the monstrous mental issues in ""The Shining"" are also favorites.  One of the continuously compelling frontiers of horror films remains the terror of mental breakdown.  People we thought we knew turn into unrecognizable demons, and this is where The Babadook takes the viewer.  Plus...there may even be a real monster!  The film's arc is to create it's own mythology to ensnare the audience, and it works wonderfully.  With truly impressive production quality, astonishing performances by the leads, camera work and editing that are far better than I am qualified to describe or discuss, I just flat loved this film.

The Babadook deals with the horror of human nature and mental illness in the same way that Polanski's Repulsion did. The Babadook builds slowly and  surely and the feeling of creeping dread is created with a look or a mood perfectly conveyed by Essie Davis. Sometimes it is what you can't see that is the scariest of all. A horrific and masterful take on a troubled mother son relationship.

6703675,3,B00O20UHDO,"I was looking forward to watching this movie based on the trailer, reviews, and ratings. Unfortunately, this movie isn't worth the 4 star rating it has on amazon or the 6.9 rating it has on IMDB. Out of 5 stars I truly believe it deserves a solid 3 stars. The movie isn't great, or good in my opinion. It's just okay. After the mother reads the book for the third time after tearing it up you already know what direction the film is headed in. Also after the first time you see the physical formation of the Babadook the scare factor is diminished. They should have stuck with the book being the only visual you have of the Babadook and continue the use of the creeping terror formula.

If you want a solid review of this movie I suggest you read M. W. Perry's review located on here. He gave it 3 stars as well and pretty much sums up how I felt about this movie, and answered something about the end I was unsure about.

Side note:
This didn't affect the rating but I just thought I should add one more thing. At the time of this review the movie is $6.99 to rent on Amazon. I suggest waiting to watch the movie until they lower the price to around $4.99. I was a little disappointed after watching the movie that I paid $6.99 to watch it. I was more upset when I saw in the bill that I was charged tax for it. In total I paid $8.02 just to watch this movie.

6703695,4,B00O20UHDO,"Director Jennifer Kent's debut feature , ""The Babadook"", shows an incredible promise of a great genre talent. It's a meticulously crafted, slow burn thriller that carefully builds its nightmarish scenario with sincerity, care, a genuine concern for its two main leads and an unwavering focus on the bond between them (which is the thread which the effectiveness and believability of this cinematic work stands proudly on). The wisest thing Kent displays is the oft forgotten knowledge that the most enduring horror films ,such as ""The Shining"", ""The Exorcist"" and the original ""Psycho"" from 1960 (which this film evokes powerful memories of), are the ones which give you just enough to get your brain questioning what you have seen and what is lurking under every shadow long after you have seen it.

  ""The Babadook"", though summoning many tried and true methods of inducing fear in its audience, always works well at building an underlying wave of suspense throughout. We feel every bit of mounting paranoia and terror through Essie Davis, as the mother of a young boy who casually begins reading a volume her son hands to her called ""Mister Babadook"" and slowly her sanity spirals out of control as she begins sensing his presence everywhere, and her terrific, nuanced and multi-layered performance.  Her mentally challenged son, 6 year old Samuel, played by Noah Wiseman, is equally impressive. The movie hinges on these portrayals and they are so incredible, the bond between the two of them so authentic, that they are one of the many reasons this film soars far above the bargain basement bin that is most genre entries.

  Kent's debut is also smart enough to give even the most seasoned moviegoer a genuine surprise. It calls into question if real monsters are those we read of before we go slumber or if they are those we call family. Not only is there hard to guess undercurrents to the drama,  in the difficult themes of the story but in the chain of the story's events.

  The pop-up book which introduces this shadowy figure which soon consumes the main characters lives is a masterful bit of creativity. There is something inherently creepy about these types of volumes aimed at children and the film knows this with the way it subtly prophecizes certain points of the chronicle only amps the intensity as the audience mentally recalls the scene and tries to predict what will occur. It's a clever, and undeniably effective, way to get us seeing the babadook as the mother and son do.

  The pace is brilliant, the cinematography is gorgeous and brings to life beautifully all that the film makes us think we see in the shadows (the use of hats and coats in the corner of certain frames to look like the shape of The Babadook, a stroke of brilliant design in itself, is especially noteworthy) and all of its many psychological underpinnings are daring to say the least. There are no cheap jump scares to be found here whatsoever and the movie deserves our praises for that in itself.

  If ""The Babadook"" falters it is in its final scene. It seems a bit unnecessary, too much out of tone with the rest of the movie and the only instance of filler found herein. But, the more I pondered this sequence the more it disturbed because it seemed so mundane. If that sounds hard to grasp you will understand once you have been through the dark journey this mother and son takes. It's an example of how well Kent understands the psychology of horror, what makes it work and why things haunt our dreams long after we've seen them. ""The Babadook"" is a prime example of this and I hope many aspiring filmmakers of the genre view this, take notes and learn.

  ""The Babadook"" is an instant classic, the best entry in its genre of the year, that brings to mind the enduring Horror greats of cinema. It has the potential to be mentioned along the likes of ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Shining"" if, at first glance, it doesn't seem quite as potent as the two. It isn't spectacularly scary to sit through , but it is smart enough to terrify through horrifying and unique images and not massive amounts of gore and a hefty body count, originally but its an experience that gradually gets under your skin and stays there and, as we know, that is a telltale sign of how you make a truly unforgettable motion picture.",1418860800,,4307,4.717333333333333

But, this is less of a horror movie, and more of a metaphor for unresolved grief, the struggles of single parenthood, postpartum psychosis, and PTSD - and how very lonely, and isolating these can be.  It's a heavy, sad movie disguised as a scary film.  Granted, the parallels are brilliantly drawn.  If you're looking for resolution beyond learning to live with the past, you're going to be very unsatisfied.  This isn't a problem for me, per se, but I've only heard about how terrifying this film is for months.  I think it would have been possible to actually make it scary AND be the metaphor it was clearly intended to be.",1418774400,3,774,4.408450704225352
6703716,4,B00O20UHDO,"As a longstanding lover of horror, I was hopeful that we were due a resurgence of great horror movies. James Wan looked like he was going to lead the charge, but he hasn't really delivered on his early promise. We'll have to keep waiting until we get another Exorcist or Omen - but little films like this one will keep us going until that happens.

The Babadook is a low budget Australian horror movie which is very restrained in its ambitions. While this was probably for budgetary reasons, its the viewer that benefits from this very focused film. Other reviews have gone into details on the unconventional story-line so I won't repeat what others have already done - but suffice it to say that the film very cleverly uses horror tropes and excellent set design and art direction to tell a small story about grief and the challenges of single parenthood. I don't want to spoil the film, but it's fair to say that the film is not  a literal one. If you're expecting jump scares or blood and gore, then this isn't for you, but for everyone else looking for a creepy, effective film that has something serious to say then look no further.

It's also very well constructed; the film-makers leave clues throughout the movie as to what's really going on - and perhaps some of these were laid on too thick - but this is a film that will make you think what it's really about and continue to think about it long after it has ended. There were some strong influences at work here -I could certainly detect elements of the Exorcist and even Eraserhead, so the crew behind the Babadook know their stuff.

Is it perfect? No - while it's creepy in places, I wasn't really ever scared by it but we all have our different triggers and tolerance levels. I also felt that it did perhaps need a another dimension (another character, another location) to spice it up; the excellently consistent sets and tone of the film sometimes were a little too much, and some changes of pace and scenery would have helped. The monster effects weren't the best, and I for one would have preferred a complete absence of CGI, replacing the effects with a well made-up actor. But other than these pretty minor points, this is a great little gem, strongly recommended for those wanting a smart, thoughtful and creepy horror.",1418774400,,2290,4.591687041564792

6703720,5,B00O20UHDO,"Once in a while, there's a film you see that manages to subvert all your expectations and turns out to be something completely different, something better and deeper. THE BABADOOK is one of those films. I'd actually been aware of it for several months before finally getting the chance to see it, occasionally visiting its IMDb page and seeing glowing reviews come in from everyone who I follow. Now having watched it twice, I think I understand what's going on, and without a doubt it is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. More than just having a creepy atmosphere and some jump scares, it explores deep emotional themes in a highly metaphorical and truly unsettling way.

 Without giving too much away, the basic story is about a single mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), and her child (Noah Wiseman), Samuel. Samuel is a rather difficult child, and Amelia is doing her best to raise him. One night, after waking up from a nightmare, Samuel picks a book for his mother to read to him: The Babadook. After this, strange things start to happen and they begin to sense a sinister presence with them in the house.

 Now, earlier I said that it explores emotional themes. One in particular is that of grief and the loss of a loved one. Again, doing my best not to get into spoiler territory, this is key to understanding what happens in the film. I thought Essie Davis did a remarkable job as a mother who is plagued by grief and her emotional range in this film was amazing. Noah Wiseman also does a great job, especially for a child actor, as her son. At first, he's very bratty and unlikeable, but he gradually changes over the course of the film and you begin to understand him more as a character and a person. The supporting characters aren't as developed, but they merely provide a basis for how to view the events that transpire and as a conduit for the audience.

 As far as horror films go, you could come away wondering what the big deal was, but then you'd have missed the point entirely. There are some typical horror movie scares and tropes, but all of that is window-dressing for the psychological horror that lies at the core. There is a creature, but it's only used and shown as much as needed. Also, in contrast to most horror movies these days, every effect was achieved practically or in-camera, quite the necessity for a low-budget film like this. I can't really think of anything bad to say. The only thing I'll caution is to go into this with an open mind, and to expect something a little more subtle than you might be used to. Other than that, I can't recommend this highly enough. Not just one of the best horror movies this year, but one of the best, period.",1418688000,,2687,4.518518518518518

6703723,3,B00O20UHDO,"""The Babadook"" is a decent movie with a creepy premise that it never quite lives up to. Essie Davis stars as Amelia, a single mother whose husband was killed the day her only son, Samuel, was born. Samuel, in turn (played by Daniel Henshall), is a lonely child, fascinated with stage magic, who as a result never gets to celebrate his birthday on the actual date. Early on, the two share a bedtime story from a pop-up book about a shadowy, malignant figure called ""Mister Babadook"". The pages are only half-filled, but we quickly discover that it's a work in progress, as subsequent encounters with the book show a dark progression of events as the Babadook draws closer.

The pop-up book is a clever gimmick, and Davis's performance, though verging on hysteria at times, really sells the premise. Once you see what's going on behind the scenes, though (and it isn't too hard to figure that out), the film stops working as a horror movie.

*** SPOILERS BELOW ***

The creature is obviously an embodiment of her own unresolved grief, and the book shows her undergoing a progressive violent breakdown, ending in the death of her son. I could tell when I saw the page about her killing the dog what would happen: it has to die so that we, the audience, see a tangible threat, but that scene immediately told me that Samuel was no longer truly in danger.

The movie really coasts into its ending, which, while fitting, still seemed a little forced. The point of manifesting her emotions externally is so that we can see her (literally) struggle with them, but the movie kind of lets that pass in the third act. In the end, her decision to accept her husband's death and move on reigns in the Babadook, but if the creature itself is a physical representation of her misery, we see no similar manifestation of acceptance and recovery; we simply have to take it on good faith.

Still, the premise is creepy enough and Davis's performance is solid throughout, so even if the story limps into home plate at the end, that's still a score. But don't watch it expecting to find a superlative horror experience. It's a good movie, but not a great one.",1418688000,23,2138,4.61578947368421

6703763,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook is a breath of fresh air to the horror/suspense genre. There have been far too many poorly conceived flasher films and ""The Haunting of ___""  lately and The Babadook is exactly what the genre needs to prove that it's still relevant and artistically innovative. At first take, I was ready to write this film off. Depressed mom, weird kid tormented by a story book monster. Didn't really sound like any new ground was being broken but I bought into the hype and I was pleasantly surprised. The film follows Amelia(fore mentioned depressed mom played by Essie Davis) and her son Sammuel(aka weird kid) trying to live a normal life in white picket fence suburbia. Early on we get the sense that their relationship is strained not just because Sammuel is a pain in the @$$ to raise but for the fact that Sammuel's father died in a tragic car accident while driving Ameilia to the hospital to give birth. The accident has the strange effect of both bonding them while creating animosity between mother and child. Amelia does her best to cope by working at an elderly home, while Sammuel spends his time making weapons to fend off a monster he calls the ""Babadook"" Things become unhinged when Amelia reads Samuel a children's book entitled ""Mr Babadook"" as a nice bedtime story. The story is a chilling pop up book (Think Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark) about a shadowy creature that wants to be let into your house and basically destroy your life. Amelia is visibly disturbed by it and it has a compounding effect on the mentally troubled Sammuel.

  The uneasy coexistence between Amelia and Sammuel starts to tailspin after having read the book. Sammuel, who was a handful before really starts to act up while Amelia struggles to cope. Worst of all Amelia starts to hear strange noises at night and is having horrifying visions/nightmares of a strange man dressed in black. The Babadook honestly scared me to the core. I felt that I was on a roller coaster that I wanted to get off of.(in a good way) The Babadook is scary good. Not so much for the ""Monster""(think a goth guy with a Lincoln hat and a pea coat) but for the heavy emotional subtext between Amelia and Sammuel. When Sammuel yells at his mom""I know you don't love me but I'm going save you"" I teared up a little. The Babadook is a excellent horror film that should be seen by both fans and doubters of the genre. The underlining message that if you feed your personal demons they can truly haunt and destroy your life had a resounding effect on me. This a film you absolutely need to see this year.",1418601600,2,2573,4.574837310195227

I think a lot of people might believe the pacing is a bit slow, but I enjoy these type of movies.  all-in-all an excellent creepy movie that goes far beyond anything Hollywood could muster up.",1418601600,,452,4.1976744186046515
6703766,5,B00O20UHDO,"A great flim, but only a good scary movie.  The Babadook has a lot to say, and it seems to whisper and remind you of things as you watch it.  You will find yourself thinking about it later, unsure of what the sticking point is.  But the things you'll ponder or really think about aren't scary things like ""what if it's in my closet right now?"" but weightier questions like ""does every mother feel like they want to literally choke their child at some point?"" or (in my case) ""Do I EVER want to have kids?"" lol.  Or, even more pointedly, ""would I be able to carry on with a  child if I lost my spouse?""

Don't get me wrong, The Babadook is a great horror movie.  But it's only a good scary movie.  And that's a good thing.  The Babdook isn't content to just make you feel some fleeting sense of fear or dread, but general unease about yourself as a person.  You won't have nightmares about The Babadook himself, or be looking over your shoulder much, and that was a slight disappointment.  But the deeper disquiet you may have, a more persistent feeling of possibly something being wrong within you- with everyone- is a difficult feeling to achieve in an audience.  That's the real horror (as opposed to scariness) of The Babadook: it's that we all have one, and (while he may not be physical) he's very real.

All in all, it's a truly great film that may not scare you quite as much- or in quite the same way- as you expected.",1418601600,2,1426,4.335849056603774

6703768,5,B00O20UHDO,"Jennifer Kent begins her story by setting us into the life that Amelia is forced to live. We learn right away that she lost her husband when he suffered an automobile accident while driving her to the hospital go give birth to their son Samuel. Since then, Amelia has remained a lonely soul with a dead-end job and a son who is an ever-growing problem in more ways than one. Soon enough the book turns up and Samuels insistence that The Babadook is real only increases the severity of the trouble he causes. With her life a wreck, Amelia is now susceptible to the demons (or whatever he is) influence, and 26 minutes into the film we get our first decent taste of horror. We continue to see the horror surface very 10 minutes or so, and it grows in intensity until you hear The Babadook speak and find yourself covered in goosebumps. After this the story took a turn that I was not expecting, focusing more on Amelias inner demons and not as much on the demon/Babadook itself, but that is not a complaint on my end. At the end of the film you will learn that the shift on focus was not really a shift in focus after all, as this is a story that deals with the consequences of living a life of grief and never recovering from it. I don't want to go too into detail because it is possible that I could ruin some of the surprise and the payoff at the end of the film. If anything, just know that this story is so much more than the typical haunted house effort. It is a breath of fresh air.

Kents story is what makes this a unique watch, and it is her direction that makes it a scary one. She sucks us into her story early on by giving us a full-frontal take on what it is like to live in Amelias shoes. We are forced to deal with Samuels tantrums as well, and I guarantee that you will hate him as much as I did  which is exactly what Kent wanted. When the horror hits we are treated to simple spooks here and there, but at the 49 minute mark when we hear the Babadooks voice I guarantee you I had goosebumps going up my legs  a rare occurrence reserved for the scariest of films. His voice was so simple yet highly effective and definitely my favorite moment of the film. There are other scares of equal quality, but given I watched this with my Sennheiser headphones his voice filled the perceived space around me as if he was actually there (hellmaybe he was). Kents atmosphere helped make these scares as great as they were, employing dark shadows and a spooky home that will prepare you for the scares that you won't be able to beat.

Overall, The Babadook is an incredible accomplishment for Jennifer Kent and probably the best 2014 horror film I have seen so far.",1418515200,4,2669,4.2792079207920795

6703770,5,B00O20UHDO,"Having read some of the negative reviews for this film, there is a common thread of the misleading trailer and ""hype"" reviews.
There is a lesson here that goes for all movies: Do NOT watch trailers, they reveal too much and often mislead.  Read just enough to decide whether you want to see a movie.  Invevitably, if you ingest a torrent about how funny, scary, great something is, you are setting yourself up to be let down.  The critics who gave this 98% on rotten tomatoes did not see the trailer or read reviews in advance.

Now for another ""hype"" review:

I hope all horror film makers watch Babadook.  It gets it right.

1) The audience has to actually *care* if the characters are in danger.  Babadook does this thanks to good writing and great (yes I said great) acting, including one of the best child performances you will see in any genre.

2) Keep the audience guessing at what's really going on while avoiding the arbitrary ""yeah, right"" plot swing.  There could be several possible explanations, supernatural or otherwise.

3) The film is free of cheap scares.  It builds dread at a steady pace, building to...well you'll have to see.

4) No gratuitous gore.  If you like torture, look elsewhere.  But the best horror, like Babadook and the Conjuring, will have you looking away because of *fear* not repulsion.

Note:
This movie makes effective use of sounds loud and subtle.  Make sure to have a decent speakers or headphones.  Most TV speakers won't do the trick.",1418515200,,1480,4.692607003891051

Half way through I was so annoyed by the characters I wondered how I'd be scared when I already wanted them to die.  The acting was good, very good in fact.  The movie had more of a ""nails on chalkboard"" feel than a scary feel, but not in any kind of good way.  A screaming annoying little kid that I would have happily killed myself the first half of the movie becomes our hero(?) for the second half while the mother (who you could sympathize with for the first 10 mins but also became an annoying character we just want to die) becomes the monster(?).  The end was moronic.  Lots of build up but no real payoff.  I'm giving it two stars because of the acting and cinematography.

The movie is focused on how this entity, the Babadook, changes the lives of a mother and her young son. The son is obsessed with monsters and sure enough, the Babadook and a Babadook book suddenly appears. Conflict between mother and son worsens and she questions her mental stability. Basically, the majority of the movie is how the mostly unseen Babadook attempts to push the mother over the edge by using the son (and memories of her late husband).

The lead actress does a great job. The kid overacts the entire movie and is a pain to watch. If I had a choice between living with the son or the Babadook, the Babadook would be the clear winner.

""Psycho, Alien, Diabolique , and now THE BABADOOK""

Wow! Sounds like a masterpiece to me. Unfortunately, The Babadook is not a masterpiece. It is not a great film. It is a VERY well-acted thriller made on a small budget, but one that fails to illicit a single decent scare from its promising concept, which the filmmakers completely bungle in the second half. I will avoid spoilers, but the film starts out strong and slowly devolves into a clichd chase film. The larger ideas about grief and single parenthood elevate this above most direct-to-video horror films, but those ideas aren't explored well enough to elevate it above numerous other, better contemporary horror films.

The filmmakers also chose to repeatedly use an extremely common stock animal sound effect for The Babadook, which any video game or horror fan will instantly recognize from the Resident Evil series as well as others. It is basically the ""Wilhelm scream"" of animal sounds and it is hilariously out of place in the film, killing all suspense whenever it is used.

The two leads are excellent. Noah Wiseman's performance is remarkable for a child of his age, but his character is written to be so grating and unlikeable that it makes it difficult to feel sympathy for his plight.

While the film sits with an extremely high Rotten Tomatoes score, the IMDB reviews are middling - currently sitting in the high 6's. As a lifelong horror fan, I side with the viewers on this one. I'm willing to forgive a lot with horror films if they deliver the scares, but The Babadook is more of a middling drama with a few average horror sequences. If you watch the trailer, you have seen literally every ""scary"" scene in the entire film.

The writer/director Jennifer Kent is clearly talented and I hope this film leads to better opportunities for her.

6703789,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook is a horror movie about the things that haunt us in reality. Its about the effects of grief, resentment and regret on the relationship between a mother and her son. Amelia (Essie Davis) and her husband get into a car accident on their way to the hospital to give birth to their first and only child. Her husband dies. She survives, as does her unborn son.

Years later, Amelia and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), have an incredibly tense relationship. Samuel has hyper-imaginative tendencies, loves storybooks, and frequently mentions the circumstances of his fathers death to strangers. He does gleefully unaware of his mothers forced smile and gritted teeth, as she tries to cope with her complicated feelings about her son, who only repeats the story because its his only connection to his father, whom he never knew. As their story unfolds, we come to understand that horror lurks in the shadows of reality, and not just in fiction.

That alone is such a strong base on which to effectively build a movie like this, for it gives a profoundly human weight to the story, which builds carefully and deliberately for a good hour before anything remotely supernatural occurs.

Then, one night, Samuel finds a strange and disturbing pop-up book called Mister Babadook on his bookshelf and asks his mother to read it to him. She does.

Then Mister Babadook arrives.

Ill say no more, expect that whatever preconceived notions you may have about the horror genre, Kents film shakes them up, reassembles them and filters them through a frightening screen of humanity and understated horror with perfect grace and restraint. Inarguably, The Babadook is of the one the best horror movies made in the past decade. Its a tour de force from Kent, who is an Australian first time writer/director, making this her big-screen debutwhat an entrance.

To those two titles I would like to add rock star because she has crafted a stylish, scary and inventive film worthy of standing alongside the best work of Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski and John Carpenter, and she did it on a shoestring budget, proving once again the value of financial limits in filmmaking. I look forward to seeing her career unfold because, based on her first effort, I think shes a true original.

For my money, Davis and Wiseman deserve the highest praise and if it were in my power, Id hand over those gold statues to them immediately. The depths to which they reach to pull out these characters is astounding. Together, they inhabit this world with complete sincerity, and when they experience terror, we experience it with them.

The Babadook also calls to mind a wide spectrum of cerebral horror films, including flashes of F.W. Murnaus Nosferatu, Nicolas Roegs Dont Look Now, Darren Aronofskys Black Swan and Lynne Ramsays We Need to Talk About Kevin. Using almost all in-camera effects, Kent develops a deeply nuanced atmosphere that somehow feels equal parts old-fashioned and innovative. Im not kidding, she does some things here that will blow your hair back, and remind you what it feels like to be 8 years old and terrified of the monster under the bed or in the closet or in the dark, damp basement.",1418515200,21,3186,4.876155268022181

It's important to take into account what the Writer/Director, Jennifer Kent. had to say about Babadook; according to her the Babadook is very much real, and is not simply the manifestation of the main character's grief.  While writing it she liked the idea that the Babdook was drawn to Amelia and her son because of their pain, and tried to pass himself off as playful in his suit 'til he started terrorize them.

6703828,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook has to be one of the best directorial debuts of all time, it's simply amazing to watch the amount of skill involved in the movie with no previous experience. This is the sort of movie that focuses on a strong story which is built on a very strong emotional foundation, which is most likely why critics are praising the film. This certainly is not your typical monster movie, it's much more deep and intellectual than that, and that is why I enjoyed it so much. There are no straightforward answers, everything is left to the viewer for interpretation. I have to admit I was expecting a different type of movie, something that featured a mysterious monster wreaking havoc inside the house walls (based on the trailer for the film), but was still not disappointed (I've been waiting for this movie for over a year!). The Babadook focuses on the relationship between a mother and her son, it's not your straightforward loving relationship either, it's much more complicated & wretched than that. I can't go too much more in depth than that without giving away too much of how the movie plays out.

A lot of people have labeled this 'the scariest movie of all time', which of course immediately raises peoples expectations and when that happens, almost never will a movie live up to that title. However, the movie is absolutely scary, Jennifer Kent knows just how to manipulate the darkness in the frame and only shows us part of the villain and lets our imaginations do the rest. Plus on a technical level, I think the design of Mister Babadook is amazing, he couldn't be more intimidating, especially since we only see the outline of his true form. Nothing in the movie comes 'easy', it's almost all up for us to decide and I think that is the brilliance of the movie, everything in the movie represents some sort of a metaphor. The Babadook is easily the best horror movie of the year (and actually one of the best movies of the year), and marks the start of a very promising career for Jennifer Kent.",1418256000,107,2013,4.622905027932961

I personally don't feel like there's too much I can write about the movie itself that won't, in some way, detract from your enjoyment and terror in experiencing it all for the first time, so I'll be very generic here:

The fresh script/screen writing.  The simple yet perfect setting for the story.  The basic and real feeling characters.  The brilliant set design made to feel slightly uncomfortable.  The carefully designed lighting, props, wardrobe and general style of everything.  All of it sucked me in and made me feel like I was 8 years old and really there.  In fact, the whole movie felt like it was drawing on my very own childhood nightmares... and I haven't actually felt a bit uncomfortable or scared watching a horror movie since I was like 10 years old.  Just 15 minutes in to The Babadook and you already know it's going to be a frightening ride.  Heck, my wife bailed on the movie at the 20 minute mark claiming, ""I'm already going to have trouble sleeping for a week, there's no way I'm ruining my life watching the rest of this.""

I also really appreciate what they did with the characters/actors.  As I mentioned, these people feel oddly ""real"" and don't seem to be acting so much as they are just living.  The sense of trauma, stress and desperation that the mother and son that lead this cast feel is absolutely palpable... and like witnessing a real parent trying to deal with a child with horrible mental problems.

6703852,5,B00O20UHDO,"Not only is The Babadook one of the most original and refreshing horror movies I have ever seen (coming from a horror junkie), it is by far the most unsettling film of 2014; possibly even in the past few decades of cinema.

What starts off as a tale of coping and grieving for a widowed mother (taking care of her hyperactive, yet troubled child) quickly takes a dark and terrifying turn in the form of something unexpected: a children's pop-up book. A once forgotten, or possibly ""placed"" *ahem* storybook of a strange nightly visitor named Mr. Babadook makes it way onto young Samuel's bookshelf; unbeknownst to him or his mother Amelia. A funny and quirky top-hatted fellow slowly turns from a playful child's thing into one of the most horrific home invaders ever conceived in the history of man.

Things definitely go bump in the night once he makes his appearance in the film, but worse yet, things go bump on your sanity watching this film. Simply put, The Babadook plays well on the fear of the unseen and unknown. Shadows are not safe, closets are instant death, and anything dark around you is instantly a source of danger.

Even more disturbing is the pain and suffering our main characters go through. Is The Babadook a figment of imagination caused by possible insanity? Could it be the ghost of someone from the past? Or does something this sinister actually exist? All these questions are up for debate as we see Amelia and Sam go through sheer and terrifying hell to uncover the truth behind the arrival of a truly uninvited house guest.

Superb sound design playing on your cautiousness, engrossing acting that sucks you in, and fantastic cinematography bring together an unforgettable and constantly dreadful atmosphere; relentlessly pursuing you through 90 minutes you're sure to spend on the edge of your seat, panicking over the next horrible thing to come. Jennifer Kent's directorial debut proves that even something as simple as a child's plaything can reduce even the bravest to fits and chills of primal, unadulterated fear. A definite watch, in my opinion. Just make sure to check over your shoulder every few minutes once you're done. And once you let him in, remember;

You can't get rid of The Babadook.

Watching her go insane was rather unsettling and the grey area of whether or not she's manifesting this thing, whether it's a real entity, or whether it's all in her mind...is so well done.  I felt like I was experiencing her exhaustion and insanity throughout the movie - constantly waiting for something to happen or for something to jump out at me.  It was so well done!  I loved the lifelessness of the house and how dull it looked - like it was stuck in time.  Just a great concept and amazingly filmed - totally wonderfully disturbing!!!",1418169600,5,597,4.59433962264151

It wasn't very scary, the premise wasn't plausible (yes, I know horror films don't all have to have this element) and it was just flat.  I can't admit to being really shocked at any time during the film and the story line was really non-existent.  The end is absurd on top of everything else.  The acting by Essie Davis is laudable though and if it weren't for her I would have just turned it off. It really was a giant waste of time.",1417996800,3,545,4.152380952380953

6703918,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook is a chilling horror film that strikes deep. The expository characterization of the two main characters establishes a desolate and scary context, both mentally and physically. While there are not many jump scares in this film, the psychological and situational horror seeps with a realistic tone that left me speechless and reflect on my own sanity.

This is a movie that can be enjoyed on different levels. Primarily, this is an amazing, twisting, psychological horror. However, integrated throughout the scenes is a conversation of what it means to be mentally sound and what it takes to deal with grief, depression, and being brave enough to face the past to continue moving forward.",1417996800,,699,5.131578947368421
6703919,1,B00O20UHDO,"I rarely take the time to critique a movie, but when I saw Babadook being compared with other psychological thrillers like Roman Polanski's The Tenant, I had to speak out. A good psychological thriller will encourage and reward repeat viewings. In The Tentant, you'll see clues that expose one man's slow descent into madness. In The Machinist you find out at the very end what's been eating away at the protagonist throughout the film. In Babadook, you don't get answers to anything. I know some people think this is a sign of genius, but it's not. It's actually just laziness and poor writing.

No matter how you try to explain the events in the movie, nothing makes sense. If the woman is doing these things, why is the son experiencing them when he's alone. If the creature is the husband, why does he want to hurt his son and wife? If the creature is a creature, where did it come from... the house? Where did the book come from? Did they just move in and find the book? Was it delivered from Amazon... who the hell knows, and after a while, you just won't care anymore.

This movie is great for people who can turn off their brains and just feel their way through the visual experience and allow the director to manipulate them, but it doesn't work on any intellectual level. I can almost hear the supporters of this movie saying in defense of it's paltry plot and the meaning behind it... ""Well, if you have to ask.""

The creepiest thing in this movie is the little kid, who resembles a bug eyed Angus Young with tourettes syndrome. I was actually rooting for the Babadook. The mother is a blend of Piper Laurie in Carrie and Jack Nicholson in The Shining, both of which are far superior movies.

Unless you have an affinity for thin plots and horrific paper pop-up books, you'll probably find that Babadook should have been titled Babadumb.",1417996800,10,1848,4.557228915662651

If you watch the trailer it basically gives the premise of the story, but what I love about this film, is the atmosphere, the acting and just the overall idea. I mean, unless I really nit pick, there really is nothing bad about this movie.
This flick gets under your skin, and has a lot of rewatch value in my opinion. Oh and the children's book ""Mister Babadook"", can be purchased if you google it. The film makers are doing a one time run of it, so if you like the film make sure to pick this up as well. I know I am going to be!

6703923,2,B00O20UHDO,"The unneeded ""horror"" on this film is what made it awesome for some, and a total pile of crap for others. It would have been a real movie if the stupid Babadook wouldn't have showed up through the whole movie. Because they wanted to reveal a several depression state giving life to a monster-like pile of crap, they could have really exceeded all expectations in both acting and story writing if it wasn't for that.

In fact, this movie could have been remained with the dark atmosphere...I mean DARKER if it wasn't for that Babadook pile of crap.

Everything was going good until it showed up. I felt my intelligence was insulted, when they gave it a total twist, (the twist that really twisted this whole film).

I expected different, I expected an intelligent film, an alternate way of dealing with a chronic depression state, but originally, not fantastically, or Burtonic (Tim Burton). If I want that I'll go rent one of his movies.

That is what basically took away 2 stars.

You can really have a great flick with good acting, good photography, and good story line, and a good representation of a severe  depression problem, without the need of falling into nonsense.

But what it is, is a very well done low budget horror movie with the power to deliver goosebumps and unquiet moments. The pace is not Hollywood fast. This is a film made in Australia and it is very obviously a labor of love. The special effects are solid. They are not CGI that I could see and for me that's a plus. I have a special love of ""practical"" special effects that are done well, and they are done very well, indeed. The story is properly creepy, the acting is top notch (so much so that when the son in the movie is acting like a brat I sort of wanted to bury him under the house) and the mystery of the story is a nice twist. What is the Babadook? I'll let you find out on your own when it comes to the creature, but when it comes to the movie, it's a mighty fine time.

6703932,5,B00O20UHDO,"This movie does everything a horror movie should. It shows us the terrifying things that surround us all. One way or another, we have to deal with them. The mother and son in this movie do it in different ways. The boy invents and builds weapons he can use to protect his mother. How she deals is the story told in this movie.

The story revolves around a single mother and her soon-to-be-seven year old son. The movie opens with an explanation of why she's the only parent and why she is emotionally detached from her son.

If you're a parent, you can relate to the mother's exhaustion. If you've ever dealt with a problem child, your own or not, you can relate to all the adults who are exasperated by the little boy in this movie. He demands, and really needs, constant attention. These kind of children are hard enough to handle when there are two parents. When there's only one the parent never gets to relax.

The mother is a good parent at heart. She reads stories to her son every night. One night he pulls a book off his bookshelf that neither of them have seen before. It's a beautiful book, with pop-ups and windows you open, the kind of interactive book that children and parents love. But not this one. It seems to be written just for them and they react accordingly.

Much more spoils the pleasure of watching the story unfold. By the time the movie ends you aren't quite sure exactly what happened, but you know you've watched a great film that you will want to watch again.

This film was very good but would have been great if it was about 15 minutes shorter with better pacing.  It was a bit slow and bit too long.  And the scene at the sisters house, with the sisters friends & a birthday party for the kids, should be excised completely.  Did not buy it for a second.  The sisters friends should not have been so transparently awful unless the whole scene was far more stylized but it wasn't realistic enough to be realism or distorted enough to be purely Essie's perspective.

6703938,4,B00O20UHDO,"An amazing horror film out of Australia that does not employ ""jump scares"" or gore - rather it has a slow inexorable tension that builds with each minute watched.  A great cast with Essie Davis as Amelia and Noak Wiseman as her 7 year old son Sam.  Both of their performances are outstanding with an entourage of great actors surrounding them.  If I am not mistaken this is Essie Davis' first foray behind the camera and she does not disappoint.

At the opening of the film, a tragic car accident suffered by Amelia and her husband becomes the catalyst for the deteriorating relationship between mother and son.  Amelia's husband does not survive the accident and the profound grief and loss felt by Amelia is so prevalent she is less the mother she should be to her son, and Sam lashes out in the most gut wrenching of ways.  But then a new and terrifying element is introduced to the pair in the form of a book.

The formula for the movie is reminiscent of movies like ""The Conjuring"" or ""The Shining"" and in my opinion that is just fine if a freshness and originality can be injected into the film.  With ""The Babadook"" originality was indeed developed into the making of this film.  Something evil infecting and influencing a family that is already at the brink of collapse increases the feeling of horror.  To add to this the atmosphere is foreboding and ramps up a feeling of dread.  The creative use of unique camera angles used to shoot certain scenes is brilliant, and combining these elements with great characters make for a movie fans of the horror genre should see.

Whether it is a good thing or bad, I am still the victim of owning the physical media and prefer to have the Blu ray disk.  Unfortunately I had to purchase the Blu ray elsewhere, as Amazon does not carry the DVD or Blu Ray version (at least when I had been shopping for the film).  Nonetheless, I consider ""The Babadook"" to be a very well done horror movie that is somewhat successful at staying with you long after the closing credits.",1417910400,2,2016,4.533149171270718

The first part of the movie seemed like it was going somewhere (pretty slowly, but going).  Unfortunately, the last third seemed like it was composed of a bunch of half-formed ideas that were thrown together.  I was very disappointed in the ending.

In my opinion, Noah Wiseman, who plays Samuel, carried this whole movie.  Without him, it would have been much worse.",1417824000,,622,4.590909090909091
6703947,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook isn't a fun dumb teens (being played by actors in at least their mid twenties), being chased through the woods by a serial killer determined to kill them each in a uniquely different and creative way. Nor is it a family moves into a haunted house they got for a bargain price sort of film. The Babadook is heavy viewing, simply due to the fact that dead beat mothers who don't discipline their destructive to society, endangering other kids offspring, are something we know exist in real life. It's hard to care about either of the main characters, but ultimately the Babadook once you've reached the end and understand what was going on, is a very good, well written, well made and very well acted psychological horror/thriller.

Basically this film starts of with a former writer, who has done nothing much with her life for the past seven years since her husband was killed, when rushing her to hospital for the birth of her son. She takes being a dead beat mother to the extreme, if you watch the extras on the DVD (for some reason it's not for sale at this time on Amazon, only this download), Essie Davis (the actress who plays her) sums her up as a mother who just can't love her son but wants to. She clearly loved her husband, and accounts blame for him not being around anymore on the son. The son growing up without the normal parental attention, except shown to him at brief moments when he is either in danger or in trouble, constantly cries wolf that a monster is in his room, and even builds dangerous destructive weapons he says to protect her. Even though a lot of the growing up backstory isn't revealed we learn his school is at their wits end and his behaviour has endangered the lives of other children. They are clearly frustrated at his mothers lack of discipline and willingness to take control of tackling the problems. We see the consequences of his behaviour on his young female cousin shortly after, in a pretty predictable that its going to happen scene. Basically no one wants the mother or child around them anymore. they are over the whole stepping on eggs shells around the mother, seeing seven years as too long to be using the loss of her husband as an excuse for either of the two's behaviour. The mother is growing more tired and depressed around their large house. To make matters worse, the son found a book in the house called The Babadook which wasn't exactly the most child friendly picture book out there. Now the son claims The Babadook is out to get him and is becoming quite destructive (and embarrassing to her) in his attempts to protect them both. A reluctant doctor supplies her with meds and when they both take them, the Babadook's presence starts to haunt the mother's life as well.

The first thing that needs to be pointed out is the acting by both the mother and child actors is superb. You pretty much instantly dislike both of them, it's pretty hard to dislike a child character, but Noah Wiseman somehow pulls this off brilliantly. Also in the DVD extras is a short film called Monsters, which was obviously a rough idea for this film. In that one the kid is a nice child, and you can see how it works so much better in this one when he isn't.

I'm not claiming like some people that this is the greatest film ever made, but even if it's a bit hard viewing at times due to the two main characters, I have to acknowledge it is well done. There's also behind the scenes as an extra, which lets you know why the house was so big (so the crew could film), and how low budget this film was. The film is even more impressive when you know these things. If you just want a fun cheesy horror flick, or even something to frighten you, this isn't that film. But if you can appreciate a well made and told tale, then The Babadook is for you.",1417824000,,3802,4.444126074498567

6703971,4,B00O20UHDO,"One of the best horror films I've seen this year. Combining psychological horror and the titular monster aspect very well. No cheap jump scares, just genuine terror whenever the horror starts to manifest around the characters. It's definitely a slow-burn, but it works where other films fail due to the interesting dynamic of the main characters relationship, a disturbed child being raised by an equally, if not more, disturbed mother, and the slow build-up also lets allows the audience to absorb its dreadful atmosphere.

My only little odd nit-pick is a painfully obvious cheap ""stock"" sound effect that is used for the creature in the climax. Any horror film buff will recognize it, and it kind of killed, though only slightly, the creepy mood of the film when I started snickering at the thought of the creature being a dinosaur.

Otherwise a highly recommended movie for anyone that enjoys the dark and creepy exploration of the human psyche, where the blurred lines of reality, sanity, and imagination house truly terrifying beasts.",1417651200,,1040,5.076023391812866

6703975,4,B00O20UHDO,"The horror genre has been in shambles in the year 2014. For every Annabelle, Ouija, Deliver Us From Evil, The Quiet Ones, As Above So Below, Dracula Untold, and I, Frankenstein, there is only one Oculus. When I first heard about The Babadook, I thought it sounded just as ridiculous as any other horror film released this year. But after hearing a number of rave reviews hailing it as one of the best horror films in years, I had to see it.

The Babadook is about a single mother named Amelia, who, after seven years, is still coping with the death of her husband. He was killed while they were driving to the hospital to deliver their child, Samuel, who was born on the day his father died. One night, Samuel finds a mysterious pop-up book called Mister Babadook, which is about a dark, enigmatic, top-hatted creature which threatens to possess those who will only 'let him in.' On the surface, The Babadook is another domestic paranormal horror film, but it doesn't take much thought to realize its symbolism. For years, Amelia had been repressing the death of her husband and quietly resenting her troublesome son for inadvertently being the cause of his father's death. After her son is removed from school and breaks the nose of his girl cousin, Amelia reaches her boiling point and begins to lose her sanity. The mysterious Babadook is emblematic of the darkness inside her that is festering and bargaining for her son's life, as well as her own. The Babadook is smartly written, but not entirely rid of genre cliches, as seen in one of its ending scenes, which is shockingly similar to last year's The Conjuring. The first two acts are also extremely slow, but this is made up for with a mostly fantastic final half-hour.

Jennifer Kent, writer/director of the film, said she was strongly influenced by David Lynch and Roman Polanski, which is fairly obvious from the film's gorgeous visual style and surrealistic imagery. It's like Mulholland Drive meets Rosemary's Baby with some Burton thrown in there for good measure. The bold gray design inside the house creates a bizarre atmosphere that recreates the tone of the Mister Babadook book while personifying Amelia's cold, bleak psyche. Just as impressive as the camerawork and art direction is the sound editing, which is cause for much of the film's scares. Instead of copping out and having a jump scare every 30 seconds, the sound design of The Babadook creates its very own unnerving world which is an experience in and of itself.

Essie Davis gives a surprisingly committed performance as Amelia. She shows off her sweet side, her broken side, her mean side, and her possessed side all with equal believability. She channels the same kind of madness that Jack Nicholson portrayed in The Shining, a parent slowly losing her marbles. Noah Wiseman, no matter how annoying his character is, is great as Samuel. He shouts, he cries, he throws tantrums, but the viewer ultimately sympathizes with him, which is not easy to achieve.

The Babadook is an excellent debut film for Jennifer Kent, who puts American horror films to shame with her sharp, fleshed-out, gorgeously shot-and-edited Australian psycho-thriller.",1417651200,,3175,4.906890130353817

6703992,5,B00O20UHDO,"Some of the greatest horror movies - I'm thinking of movies like The Exorcist, Let the Right One In, The Shining, Don't Look Now, and to a lesser extent, Ginger Snaps, The Fly, and Jacob's ladder - have one important thing in common: they take their time to let us get to know the main characters, and to empathize with the ordeal they face. And more often than not, isolation and vulnerability are as terrifying and overwhelming as the monsters they face - or turn into.

The Babadook deals with that inward turn with a virtuosity and intimacy I've rarely seen. Much of the movie is about the strained and warped relation between a single mother and her six-year-old son, and what we see is as often emotionally painful as it is viscerally scary. The movie steers clear of the gore and jump-scares that make up the bulk of modern horror movies, and instead relies on suspense, suggestion, and some terrific acting from both its leads.

A word of warning - this is probably not to the tastes of all horror movie fans. If you're looking for straighs scares (like, say, Paranormal Activity) gore (Saw, Hostel, etc) or tongue-in-cheek (Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street) look elsewhere.

6703999,5,B00O20UHDO,"This is not a traditional horror film. It is an intense, disturbing and melancholic psychological drama first, and then a horror-thriller-monster movie second. Viewers expecting an effects-filled frightfest will be sorely disappointed. However, those cinephiles open to indie films that challenge and defy typical genre-labeling will be richly rewarded by a harsh but magnificent experience.

The story pivots around a pair of mother-son leads and their gut-wrenching love/hate relationship following a tragic loss. The movie brilliantly alternates the viewer's loyalties and opinions of each character as the superbly acted protagonists easily flip from sympathetic heroes to loathsome monsters in a blink. The film is brutal in its stark and realistic portrayal of their dysfunction, as their horrific relationship creates a bevy of problems, manifesting as insanity, depression, hallucination, sleep deprivation, and eventually the titular monster itself. Finally, cinema has showcased another boogeyman that haunts dreams beyond the silly and stale Freddy Krueger.

The metaphor between the monster and the madness is quite obvious and clich, but that's not to say the creature and its role aren't expertly handled and utilized. While there are a few solid, classic scares like a shape moving or suddenly appearing in the shadows, the far more horrifying parts of the movie involve watching family members abusing and torturing both each other and themselves.

I understand the need by both viewers and filmmakers to pigeonhole this film as a ""horror"" movie to easily rank/discuss/market it etc. But to typecast it does this masterpiece of family dysfunction a great disservice. If the scant supernatural elements were removed, the remaining film would easily be in all the discussions for the top awards in directing, writing, set design, score and acting for its bold portrayal of a family grappling with loss. Yet this ""horror"" film is simply so smart, powerful and entertaining, it may well still challenge for all of those awards anyways.",1417392000,8,2047,5.512738853503185

6704002,2,B00O20UHDO,"I really must agree with some of the other reviewers that speak to the self-appointed literati that screen a movie they believe to be in the realm of high art or a departure from what we see in our everyday, run of the mill cinema.  This highbrow elitism is the very cause of why this particular film is receiving unwarranted ratings for a movie that is frankly bland and devoid of the substance that should be part and parcel in this genre.  It is true that many of us may be jaded when we look to horror.  We expect to find more gore and even, dare I day, gratuitous violence.  What we certainly do not expect, is to find a movie that centers on an antagonist we view as a cartoon replica and never develops further.  Moreover, (spoiler alert) is patently silly and clich when the director decides to enmesh the protagonist in the role of the evil doer.  I am so tired of the innocent inheriting the qualities of the spirit realm and then turning to the camera in the hopes that now we will fear those we have come to know.  This was the real dodge for me in this film.  I truly wanted to see the Babadook develop from more than a shadowy figure into a substantial, fear engendering villain.

The other issue was the young boy.  Yes, he played his role masterfully; if by masterfully we are looking to be completely weary of the endless screaming and whining that occurs throughout the movie. This case study could have been accomplished with significantly less focus paid to his persona and more on the sincere development of scenes where the combat of the family versus cartoon resided.

If you look to this film for a Friday with a girlfriend or boyfriend, where surpises erupt infrequently than this is the film for you. If you truly are an admirer of frightening horror, albeit without intense gore, it is not.  It is indeed clever and does offer insight into the human psyche if that is where your dark realm is searching. The height of pretentiousness emerges when we speak to this in the true horror sense. The default position to the throngs of critics is the default position of intelligent, whether or not you view this in that vein is completely subjective and cannot ever be accurately measured by anothers taste.  It simply does not work on a pure horror level and never fires on all cylinders with even the most remote 'scare.'  When I look to foreign horror (and offer something to compare) I would recommend Frontiers, High Tension, Martyrs, Inside and even Mutants.

6704003,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook is quite the little gem of a ghost story that sustains an eerie atmosphere, something that many others all too often fail to do.

The movie is a mix of The Conjuring and The Shining in that it focuses on a malevolent force, a precocious child who is haunted and in danger, and a parent who seems to have little control. A widow struggles while raising a young son on her own. Her husband died the night of Noah's birth on the way to the hospital. The little boy has behavioral problems along with unusual visions of a mysterious figure from a child's book. The ante is upped when the mother begins to see the figure also.

The lead actors turns in riveting, suspenseful performances. The movie invokes a primal fear, seeps into your subconscious, and takes a little while to shake off.

_________________________________________________

In this Australian based horror film, a mother is trying to cope from the loss of her husband when going into labor with her son. Upon getting ready for bed, Samuel uncovers a book for his mom to read to him called The Babadook. But soon after, Samuel begins to see things and runs to his mom saying he sees the Babadook. To her dismay, Amelia herself fears that Samuels plea for help may not be left unnoticed and that the Babadook may be real after-all. The movie is directed by Jennifer Kent and stars Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman.

Coming to the end of another year, 2014 has not had any luck with the horror genre and its disappointing because its one of those genres that gets people excited for. However, all is not lost as this little indie film The Babadook is one of the most terrifying films of the year. Everyone has been speaking about the movie before seeing it and have said that it isn't your usual horror film with gore and death. And they were right because the movie is based on the tragedy of mom whos trying to move on with her life while raising a son whos quite imaginative. When they discover the Babadook as a book things slowly begin to unravel and starts to tear apart their lives.

There is a lot to appreciate in the film because the cinematography is what helped build the suspense and sometimes tries to get under your skin for what you cant see. The Babadook is something you never see in the light but on occasion youll see shadows or figures of him that move around while Amelia sleeps or sees it with her own eyes. Because the Babadook gets stronger on fear it little by little exposes itself to Amelia and Samuel until their so scared that it finally becomes what it really is. And I do have to mention the book that Amelia eventually reads to Sam that is the most disturbing book any parent could read to a child whos already afraid of monsters in the night. When shes reading it the pictures and words are so innocent at first until it changes into a creature that is dangerous then first thought. I found that scene very effective in building up the story and to what we essentially see as the film goes on.

Great performances by Essie Davis as Sams mom, because from the start you see a mom who loves her son and understands that the loss of her husband (sons father) has had a big effect on their lives. You also get to know Samuel, whos played by Noah Wiseman, who has a wild imagination and likes to do magic. However, being a kid, it takes a toll on Amelia and soon Samuel has trouble in school. At one point I thought Samuel was a handful and any mom or single parent who sees this film can relate to Amelias situation. Ill even go as far to say that Samuel wasn't your average kid because of how imaginative he could be. I know Ive referenced this a lot but it has to be brought up because it plays a part when the Babadook enters the picture. Once the madness starts, its hard for Amelia to discern her sons behavior from that of the influence of the Babadook.

The film uses very little blood and has no gore that really adds respect to the horror genre. So many films today suffer from excessive amounts of gore that studios feel thats what audiences want to see. But in reality its films like The Babadook that puts a smile on my face because of the originality and using the technique of shadows and sound that add terror on screen and doing away with jump scares. You may even sense Guillermo Del Toro in some of the film from a technical standpoint. And yes the Babadook is never revealed in full but you sense it there as Amelia begins to see things. Thats another plus in that you don't always have to show the monster which actually that more scary and leaves it to the audiences imagination.

If your somebody who is disappointed with horror movies this year and want to turn the page to something good, then check out The Babadook. For someone like Jennifer Kent who makes her directorial debut here you are impressed by her talents that she brings to the film. Definitely check out this movie as you will see respect come back to horror and fans of it.",1416873600,,4221,4.41206675224647
6704007,1,B00O20UHDO,"Hey, guess what? The acting in this movie was right on! The effects sadly appear to be all CGI, but then again...

...there isn't enough going on in this movie to care.

 In short, it's your run of the mill ghost type story using the same old techniques to scare you, but alas in the end you just have to wonder, why is the Babadook taking so much time, why not go for the whole direct approach and wrap things up?

 Mind you, the basic premise to this tale is fantastic. I mother is reading her son what is supposed to be a Children's book, though as it goes on, the story gets dark and darker, and the last few pages are blank, thus leaving room for the story to come into reality, and the pages to be completed there in.
 Though, that being said, a whole lot of nothing happens from here on out. The mother just goes through emotional highs and lows, so I assume a mother watching this could relate, I.E.,""Oh, imagine if I was on PMS, worried about my son, and then a ghost/demon began to haunt me!"" Though again, that's as far as this movie goes. It honestly has no rhyme or reason, it just drags out for far too long and would have worked much better as a 20 minute short.

 That being said, if you are a soccer mom and haven't watched too many horror flicks, and don't really follow plots and plot points anyhow, then this might make you jump, might make you worry as you worry for your own child, but that's about it. It's boring over all.",1416787200,4,1446,4.194945848375451

There is violence but it's no where near the level of the average US horror movie today. This is very much a slow burn, mind-messing type of movie.

6704012,5,B00O20UHDO,"If it's in a word
Or it's in a look
You can't get rid
Of the Babadook

Grief is such a powerful emotion.  It clouds your judgment.  It colors the way in which you interact with the world, how you see the people in it and how you deal with everyday living.  People deal with grief in completely different ways.  It can turn to anger or depression.  It can make you overcompensate with giddiness.  One thing you don't see very often is horror movies that deal with grief as its central theme.  Surprisingly, when it is used, it's often used effectively, as in The Orphanage.  Or the Babadook.

Amelia is a single mother, widowed by a car accident that took the life of her husband.  Compounding this issue is that the couple were on their way to the hospital to deliver their son, Samuel.  The Babadook opens years after that event, just as Samuels is going to turn seven.  His birthdate obviously coincides with the husband's death, so pressure surrounds them.  Amelia and Samuel deal with this overwhelming grief in completely different ways.  Samuel acts out and has become convinced that an evil presence is going to take his mom away from him.  He carries makeshift weapons to school and his interactions with others prove that he lacks certain social cues.  He's looked at as a weirdo and no one seems to want to be around him.  Amelia, burdened by grief and also trying to make ends meet as a single mother, seems depressed.  She frequently spends more time sleeping and when she looks at Samuel, you can see the resentment in her eyes.  And as the birth/death date starts to come closer, her depression and tension gradually increases.

I haven't even mentioned the titular villain in this movie yet because, like any good horror movie, the story isn't simply about the horrific being.  But when a book shows up called Mr. Babadook and depicts horrific events in a pop-up book fashion, Samuel freaks out.  More pressure weighs on Amelia.  They both become increasingly cognizant that something evil is following them. Mr. Babadook is quite an original creation and when it shows up, it's often freaky and disquieting.  Disquieting is actually the best word I can think of to describe this movie. Viewers looking for jump out scares or disturbing violence, etc., probably won't enjoy the more subtle and creeping familial horror here.  It's scary and intense at times, but even when it's not trying to scare you, there's a disquieting dread that sits just beneath the surface for the entirety of the film. When I first watched the movie, I didn't particularly care for the resolution.  But the more I think about it, the more it seems like the perfect ending to the theme and intent of the movie. One thing the movie does perfectly is the way it presents the story to you.  Even as it progresses toward the finale, you doubt whether the events are true or if they're made-up delusions brought on by depression, sleep deprivation and resentment. Fantastic acting, particularly with the weight of the story resting on Essie Davis' (Amelia) shoulders.  Grief oftentimes sits below the surface, ready to rear its ugly head when you least expect it. The film examines these powerful emotions and in a way, the Babadook becomes the thematic and visual expression of that emotion.  But even as Amelia tries to overcome her grief, you have to remember:

You can't get rid of the Babadook.",1415750400,259,3385,4.735042735042735
6704013,4,B00O20UHDO,"Being a mother is hard enough; being a widow with an unruly child is downright torturous. In Jennifer Kent's thrilling and wryly comical horror The Babadook, the pain of motherhood is manifest in the form of a demonic creature sprung forth from a child's storybook. Set in a small Australian suburb, over-burdened mother and care worker Amelia (Essie Davis) is struggling to balance work with watching over her troubled 6-year-old son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Born on the same day his father was killed in an accident, Samuel has never celebrated a birthday at the right time, just one of many ways his mother tries to distance herself from the terrible memory.

Already in distress, Amelia's life gets worse when the disturbed and distressed child begins acting out over a monster he believes lives in his room. Known as The Babadook, this seemingly imaginary creature has the boy arming himself with weapons to fight back, leading to understandable problems at school. When he gets kicked out, the stressed-out Amelia begins to spiral further, dismissing her son's cries about the Babadook. But when a mysterious book named after the creature shows up on the bookshelf, and she makes the mistake of reading from it, the horrifying events it foretells spook her into a state of constant paranoia.

An assured, Polanski-esque debut by Kent, The Babadook explores the anxieties of single parenthood and the inability to overcome tremendous grief.  The tension she's able to build from this dark fairy tale escalates at a feverish pace, while the ambiguous nature of it keeps us on our toes. Is the Babadook really a supernatural presence to be feared? Or is there something else going on that Amelia, and perhaps even Samuel, are unwilling or unable to accept? The Babadook himself isn't especially terrifying, in fact Kent has a sense of humor about many of his dastardly appearances, but that only serves to make him all the more terrifying. The real horror comes from watching the eroding psyche of Amelia and Samuel, who we come to empathize with, and how the Babadook corrodes what had been a nurturing mother/son bond. When the winking, wry tone fades the film loses much of its steam but at no point does Kent fall back on pedestrian shocks. Save those for the low-budget ""found footage"" flicks that clutter up multiplexes on opening weekend. Conjuring up frights by putting truly sympathetic characters through the psychological wringer, The Babadook is one of the best the genre has to offer and Kent a fresh voice to keep an ear out for.",1415664000,,2544,4.9392523364485985

I really enjoyed the unexpected ending and agree this is a 5 star ghost story with outstanding acting,script,direction,and great overall film quality!
Very impressive original story, one of the best of 2014 !!!.",1415059200,5,478,4.841463414634147

6704023,5,B00O20UHDO,The Babadook hit a home run with me.  I was completely engaged with the characters and the story surprisingly early into the movie and I found myself caring for the mom and felt her pain dealing with her out-of-control son who worked himself up every night about monsters in their home.- that little guy did a tremendous job playing the kid we can't help but wanna kill just to shut him up!  The story line of the Babadook was awesome and intensity started slow and grew to unbearable frightening paranoia wrapped up in evil and finished up with a bow of impending doom.  You must watch this gem from Australia - it's a solid 5-star horror story.  Awesome job by the lead actress....absolutely believable characters.,1415059200,3,716,4.704
6704024,5,B00O20UHDO,"I have seen a million horror flicks. I like a movie with a good story line, some depth and one that doesn't necessarily have to make me jump out of my seat. In horror, those are few and far between. For me, less is more and this movie did it. If you are looking for a slasher film, please go elsewhere. This one is psychologically chilling. Simply put, about 20-25 minutes into it - I was getting that little kid feeling of impending doom- like being in bed at night during a thunderstorm, thinking that I just saw something move in the crack of my closet door and knowing that whatever it is, if it wants to get me, it WILL.
  Disturbing and I loved it.
  A possession film of sorts.  The ending could have been better, but still, don't miss it!",1414972800,2,746,4.225352112676056

6704026,5,B00O20UHDO,"So far I have only seen two Australian horror films. This and The Tunnel Movie. I love horror and am constantly looking for new films to watch. When I saw the trailer for this back in January of last year I was really looking forward to it and The Babadook did not disappoint! For someone who watches a lot of horror, this one actually made me anxious and uneasy which is great since that is what horror is meant to do. the effect were pretty good, cinematography is great, and it was very well written. I live in the States but thankfully i have a multi-region disc player so if this doesn't come out in America I might just to buy this version. I do hope there will be a bluray release with some great special features though, that would be great!",1414972800,4,749,4.28169014084507

6704028,5,B00O20UHDO,This was more complex than an average horror movie and on some level I think there was a lot of metaphor going on but I can't unweave the plot lines as it all seems to merge together. Enough to say that if you are looking for an intricate story with eerie mood and set this would be for you. The acting is nothing short of superb. You will feel haunted well after the credits run.,1414886400,3,380,4.08
6704029,5,B00O20UHDO,"The Babadook is the perfect example of a cheap thrill(er) working perfectly.

With just  two leads, Essie Davis as Amelia the mother and Noah Wiseman as Samuel the son and fewer than a dozen supporting actors none of whom speak more than a hundred words, you can't trim a cast much more spare.

It uses just a couple inexpensive visual effects and sounds that are  sort'a free; so ""cheap"" still applies.

Its premise suggests an homage to a movie from 1961 that was based on original story that's nearly 120 years old, Henry James' The Turn of the Screw.

James crafted a story that may or may not have had a ghost about children who may or may not have been evil in which a housekeeper may or may not have lied to a governess who may or may not have been crazy and who may or may not have frightened the children to death because (or not) of a frustrated desire for the children's guardian.

The simply terrifying Babadook is a manifestation from an eponymous pop-up book from hell.  While this shadowy threat becomes more tangible and menacing as the film progresses, the one thing for uncertain is its source.

Did Amelia write the book? Is she or is Samuel the psychic source point for the larger evil?

Mother and son trade off being Dr Jekyll or Mr. Hyde.  Amelia is loving or vengeful; Samuel is protective or off his rocker.

At first we see just a home sleep deprived by nightmares experienced by both Amelia and her son.  Amelia seems the worse for this since she is forever being awakened by her son who she then has to comfort for hours nightly --while she can't even get through an erotic dream without an interruption.

The family is certainly an unhappy one.  Samuel knows and repeats the story of his birth and his father's death--the dad died  trying to get Amelia to a hospital to deliver the boy.

Needless to say the boy's birthday has not been celebrated in his seven years.

Another child's birthday party proves as ill fated.  All the mothers who brought children to the party are wearing black. Amelia has her first instance of her increasingly unbridled rage, and Noah pushes the birthday girl from a tree house, busting her nose.

Some people try to help.  The school wants to give the boy his own teacher.  Amelia's sister sits the boy until he terrifies her daughter.  The police would help but Amelia has destroyed the proof of a possible stalker.  Community services begins an investigation.

All of the above happens in an atmosphere of hallucination and terror that rise without cease.

The ending or endings are uncertain as will be  the condition of any seat you used while watching this movie.

The Babadook will not make you just jump out of your seat-- it will keep you levitated from
 that seat for 93 minutes.",1414886400,82,2748,4.562372188139059

When you get what this really is, you'll appreciate how well this was executed from start to finish, especially as a [comparitively] low-budget film. Some audience members will have personal experience that will make this film all the more deeply understood and appreciated. If you don't get the deeper things, it's still got plenty of horror film value to satisfy. Well done, Babadook.",1533340800,,405,5.059701492537314

8681556,3,B00O20UHDO,"This was really, really good up until the 60 or 70% mark. It was suspenseful because you couldn't tell if the monster was real or some kind of shared delusion. But then the movie lost steam and it started to sputter, going around in circles until it crashed on the ground. It became one of those films where the monster is dead! but then, no he isn't! again and again, which is a sign that the writer/director didn't know how to resolve the situation she had created and was just trying to stretch it out to make it 90 minutes. The very ending wasn't the right fit at all. Everything was wrapped up with a bow on top, which just wasn't true to the spirit of the film. Some people have said that the ending was ambiguous, but I found it to be really trite. All in all, kind of a let down, though the first half is great.",1530576000,,819,4.1572327044025155
8681557,5,B00O20UHDO,"This and the Witch are the two best horror films to come out in a long, long time. The great thing about the Babadook is, beyond being creepy as hell (and only has one cheesy moment near the end that was kind of tropy) is the intelligent way it depicts grief and it's effects on a person and the fact that it will always be there and has to be managed. I'm not a big horror fan but this is a very interesting, thought-provoking horror film.",1529884800,,440,4.127906976744186

8681559,5,B00O20UHDO,"Horror movies seem to have one thing in common. None of them are actually horrifying. Some of them are, indeed, horrible but that is probably not what the producers are shooting for. And then there is The Babadook.

This movie does what so many other horror films fail to do. It scares! Yes, this movie is scary. It's been three days since I watched the movie and some of the images are still creeping around in my head. And that's what scary movies are supposed to do. They're supposed to get inside your head. I am not even allowed to mention the word ""Babadook"" around my girlfriend!
