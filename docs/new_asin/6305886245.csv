The film suffers a little by its amature-ish main characters, thats why I give it a 4 stars, but over all every actor does a good job. This is also Donald Pleasence's last film since he past away a year before this was released. This film greatly pays tribute to one of Donald's most famous works, Halloween 1-6. There is a great scene with great dialog that pays tribute to it. This film is for either a die-hard horror fan, a Donald Pleasence fan, or just a Halloween fan. I really enjoyed this one.",993600000,3,610,4.222222222222222
7897129,2,6305886245,"Possibly I'm biased, I bought this on a whim one day because I'd seen other titles from Synapse such as ""Evil Dead Trap"" and ""Brain Damage"" and I thought that maybe this would rank amongst those. So long story short, I was dissapointed. I really wanted this movie to be good, and it was,  in certain aspects.  The art direction and cinematography were wonderful; they had brilliant settings that could have put Kurosawa to shame.  Horror directors would drool over the locations they used.  But unfortunately they let the actors talk.  Now I'm no stranger to horror films, I understand that the acting is not going to be Shakespeare but good lord did these actors stink.  And worse than the acting was the music; lab monkeys could have made a better score.  Any time there was a scene where the atmosphere started to sink in, Corky and his band would kick in and spoil the experience.  So in conclusion; did I like this film? No.  Did I hate this film? No.  Would I recommend this film to purchase?  Not for the money.",986256000,2,1018,4.538461538461538

7897131,1,6305886245,"Fatal Frames is the worst Italian ""giallo"" (read: violent  mystery) I've ever seen, period. It's overlong, unintentionally hilarious,  completely boring, utterly stultifying in its desperate attempt to clone  Dario Argento's or Brian De Palma's early oeuvres. Not to mention the  brain-damaging, dance-like soundtrack (by Al Festa himself) or the  pug-ugly, silicone-enhanced, grossly overweight starlet who produced this  mess and got to star in it. Geez, my 50 year old next-door neighbour could  act + look better! Do yourself a *waaay big* favour and, if you're in the  mood for Italo chillers, buy something else instead (e.g. Fulci's Don't  Torture A Duckling DVD).",965952000,8,671,5.5
