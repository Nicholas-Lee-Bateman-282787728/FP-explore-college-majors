3659855,5,B001JV5BHQ,"I didn't see this show until it was run on HDNet--and I LOVE IT!!  Everyone I've spoken to who has SEEN the show loves it too.  Too bad Showtime or whoever did not have the visibility needed for a show like this to take off.  I like Pushing Daisies too, but not as much as Dead Like Me.  I'll miss Rube and the original Daisy, Daisy Adair, but I'm sure the writers will make up for anything lost.  My copy is on order!!! (I already got season one and two for my husband for Christmas--he was the person who got me hooked on the show!)",1232323200,5,534,4.0476190476190474
3659856,3,B001JV5BHQ,"I'm a big fan of Dead Like Me and was greatly looking forward to this movie, but ultimately it just did not deliver.

The Problems:
1. The plot is all over the place. There's really no overarching message and it's very disjointed.
2. The movie ignores conventions from the show. A major part of the story shouldn't be able to happen and isn't explained at all in the movie. It's confusing for fans who've watched the show and it's confusing for newcomers because the movie has a throwaway line that hints it shouldn't be happening.
3. The characters are out of character. None of the characters act like they did in the series, Daisy can be explained by the new actress (who would have been better as a new character as she is a poor Daisy), but the others have no excuse. The new character Cameron might as well not exist and his ending opens more questions than it answers.
4. The ending. The ending just blows and makes little sense. Though I'm glad they used the song from the show.

I could go on, but what it ultimately boils down to is that this isn't a great ending to the series. It really needed another hour to fill out the plot and the writers really needed to sit down and watch the show. It really felt like a pilot for a ""new"" (dare I say network) version than an ending for the series.",1232323200,,1301,4.327868852459017
3659857,5,B001JV5BHQ,"I doubt that the boys (& girls) in the back or boardrooms of the networks will ever be able to see past their short sighted ratings goals, where mammon means everything, & truly original televison at the bleeding edge of dark humour can so easily fall victim to the whims of those blinkered exec's in the bowels of TVLand, who are truly lacking in vision.
Just as 'Firefly' had to be rounded off by the making of 'Serenity,' maybe 'DLM: Life After Death' is just some more unfinished business which was needed in order to put the show to rest, before the viewing public can move on again?
I only hope that there is still room left at the end of the film to allow for a series 3, 4, 5, & 6 maybe?

The new boss character is not well-developed at all, which causes the movie to seem a bit choppy in places. Ellen Muth, as George, does a great job. The other reapers also do their characters justice, but thats probably because we are familiar with them from the series.

I honestly didn't even care for Ellen Muth's performance. She looked like she had smoked one too many crack pipes or something in between the show and this awful movie. Daisy was super annoying not only because she wasn't the same actress but she also acted nothing like Daisy. Mason was the same actor but was a lot more of a do**** than in the show. And absolutely NO attention is given to the relationship between Mason and Daisy.

3659895,1,B001JV5BHQ,"If the actress who played Daisy wouldnt be in the movie, then they could have easily written her out. Instead they replaced her with a badly done slapstick style idiot who couldn't act her way out of a paperbag. Aside from that atrocity, the movie also decided it would go against many of the rules set up in the series, only there wasn't any consequences. In the series if you didn't reap a soul before the person died, then the soul would be trapped in the dead body. Not in the movie. If they wanted to spare a life in the series, it could lead to a butterfly effect that would blow up horribly (with the exception being the salted peanut candy man). In the movie, this was also not a problem. All the characters except George, had been reaping for decades. They knew the reasoning behind everything they did, and yet they just blindly pranced behind the douchey pied piper of the after life. This wasn't like the characters at all. George having a relationship with her sister again, but not losing any memories as a result? What happened there? It was nice that they decided to make a movie for the fans who loved the series, and wanted some closure, but this..... this was not that movie.

3659913,2,B001JV5BHQ,"I was totally addicted to the TV series while it ran...and have binged at least three times since it ended, watching again. It was a great show.

Unfortunately, this ""movie"", which was clearly made to finish the story, was a miserably written, and ripoff of the former show's excellence.

Loved having Ellen Muth back as the lead, but some of the new characters in the movie were badly cast, and the storyline did not properly extend the original premise.  The new lead ""Reaper"" clearly did not meet the original's storyline, and I found it a cheap attempt to just extend the show for nothing more than $$.

Sorely dissapointed, and would love to see another movie made that truly closes out the story...that being ""Toilet Girl"" finishing her tour of duty, and ""moving on"".

Not recommended to true Dead Like Me fans. You will walk away feeling ripped off.",1490054400,,856,4.718120805369128

My biggest beef is that when the series ended, Daisy's character was really starting to deepen and round out, and the movie flattened her back out to the point that it was kind of insulting.  I'm sure officially there was a ""schedule conflict"", but I can't help but wonder if this is why the original actress wasn't on board.  Either way, it was nice to see George's story continue a bit further, but I thought it left a lot to be desired (Mandy Patinkin not excluded).  I still don't have a sense of closure for the series, but I guess the movie did a fine enough job of killing it for me.",1488240000,,723,4.240875912408759

If the new character had been killed off at the beginning of the movie it would have been better.  The new character stunk and ruined the original story line.  Now I see why Mandy Patinkin opted out of participating.  The script was pretty bad and I give it a zero.

My wife and I love this show so much that we re watch the entire series every other year or so. this is an offbeat, quirky, funny, sad and bittersweet drama dealing with death and life and beyond. This show was canceled way too soon. The cast is fantastic. The show does get canceled before the story is completely finished although it does end in a good place for an ending of sorts. Thankfully there was a movie made for release to DVD that wraps up the main character Georgia Lass's story arch and kind of brings the whole thing full circle. I will warn you that the movie is not in my opinion as good as the series. They had to cast another actress for the so perfectly executed  character Daisy Adair originally played by Laura Harris.

It was terrible.
I wish I'd read the reviews first and saved myself $2.99.
It seemed like they were trying to accomplish too much, the tv episodes did a better job tying in storylines than the feature-length film did.

One question left unanswered, though, is what happened to Betty, and also eternity, when she jumped into someone else's eternity. Rube had said it would be bad, but there never seemed to be consequences other than a slight earthquake.

The writers finally saw the light with this movie and gave us what many of us wanted to see: More interaction between George and her sister. In my opinion, that's one of the reasons the show only lasted a couple of seasons. They simply left too much hanging in the air for too long.

As for some of the comments about Daisy, I found the new Daisy to be no different than the original. I never liked the Daisy character and I felt that Betty brought so much more to the table with her personality than did Daisy. Both Daisy's were silly and over the top, but that was the way they were written. The writers did stick to the characters fairly closely, but without Rube, it just didn't have the same appeal as the TV show. It seemed as if the new ""head grim reaper"" was simply written in because there's supposed to be a ""head grim reaper"".

Throughout the season and in the movie, I wanted to see more of Crystal. I loved that character, and would loved to have seen more of her in the show and the movie.

This was the equivalent of taking every food you ever liked and putting it in a blender, adding mud, and being forced to drink it.
They took characters we loved, and destroyed them, I sound dramatic. Reggie, REGGIE was the only true to character character. There is so much freeze dried bull** in this. It created more questions than answers. I understand that Mandy Patakin wasn't going to be in this, and (not spoiler, it's literally the first five minutes of film) just, killing off his character with NO reason, and having the reactions the way they were was infuriating. I know Mason and Rube butted heads, but there was a line that made me livid. Then Roxy's reaction, was ridiculous, she is way more level headed than the character they wrote in this. Mason was always a jerk, but his behavior to everyone was out of character. Daisy, who i was just begining to like when the series ended, reverted, and horribly, I know a lot of people don't like the new actress, whatever, i can overlook that, because the writing for her made her a complete airhead. So i can look past the casting (she is a really good actress, on 24 her and old daisy played sisters, she is a good actress, this just destroyed her).
George was pretty much George, but some stuff was off about her, there are some good scenes with her and Delores, but that's about it. Oh and her and Reggie, but amazon spoils that in it's review.  It's a good scene, it's the closest thing to closure we get.

Fifty minutes of it is worthless time that you'll never get back. I am hearing Steve Martin's voice from the movie Trains, Planes and Automobiles telling John Candy's character, ""Here's an idea. When you're telling these stories, have a point!""
The characterization of, and the actress chosen to play, Daisy Adair is just insulting to Dead Like Me fans. Mason and Roxie are unlikeable (not the fault of the actors).

I would I actually give it 2.5 stars, but given between ""didn't like it"" and ""it's okay"", I actually didn't completely hate it, like many fans of the series seem to have.

Alright, I recently discovered the series and fell in love with it, and no the movie doesn't have the quality or the charm that the series had, but it did give me a strange sort of closure. The biggest negative for me was the new actress who took over the role of Daisy Adair--believe everything you have read in this review and others---she brings no life to the character (pun intended) like the original actress did. She is really just completely cringe-worthy in the role, and I wish the producers decided to write her out of the movie script as they did Rube.

Ok flaws -- as I mentioned, new Daisy sucks. Rube is definitely missed. And I didn't like how Roxy was so manipulated at the drop of a hat. Series Roxy would never have taken that corporal crap. She would have seen right through Cameron's game. Also she was given weak lines that didn't do her character justice. There's still a lot of loose ends. Did Rube really ""continue on""? Or where is he? What about all the souls and the reaper ""rules"" that seemed thrown out the window? What happens there? And let's not get started on all the questions that were left open-ended in the original series.

Positives -- I love Delores. I was glad to see her back in the movie giving Murray a proper send off. She was still able to make me smile and chuckle. That poem at the end--wonderful.

But most of all, I really liked the George/Reggie storyline. For me, I think that's what gave me the most closure. Of course it was fun to see the gang all together again (sans original Daisy and Rube), but as I watched the series final, the big hole left in me was that George ""haunted"" her old home but never made that connection with them again, especially her sister which she mostly ignored during life. I loved her being able to connect with Reggie and finally be the big sister she needed to be. I also liked that Joy seemed to be healing and coming to be a decent mom, as she was pretty unbearable many times during the series. But she, like so many of the beloved characters, is flawed after all. It was nice to see she had grown in a positive way five years after her eldest's death.

So those are my few cents. Go into watching the movie with low expectations. Don't expect all the loose ends to be wrapped up in a pretty little bow. Take what you can get out of it. Or if you were satisfied with how season 2 ended, don't bother with it. But for me, it helped. It wasn't perfect, heck it wasn't even that great, but it was something, and so I can look past those minor quibbles.",1440460800,,2735,4.342465753424658

The plot for the movie is passable and seems to wonder and drag itself around but there are a few moments that stand out and bring closure to a few key plot points of the series.

3660159,3,B001JV5BHQ,"Its like the original series but not produced in the same way. The mom and daughter plot-line turned out really well. Her sister is grown up now and must deal with the passing of a secret boyfriend. The mom is just the same and is well acted. However, the secondary characters ran into problems without Rube and with a replacement actress for Daisy, it almost worked. To be fair she did a good job trying to bring her to life. The writing just wasn't the same. They did cross boundaries they wouldn't have in the original series like not following any reaper rules and trying to kill the undead. They could have touched on gravelings a bit more if they were going to make it fun. Making Daisy an incompetent actress and the druggie guy just taking girls out throughout the entire movie was a bit of a head scratch-er. Having Roxy fire her weapon when she is a cop and not investigating the changes that were too good to be true didn't make much sense. Everybody had their own problems to deal with but the characters didn't interact very well, and for some of them it wasn't a personal journey. So as a movie it would be hard to explain why this exists. There is some good acting and moments that help wrap up the series. Joy and her cat Murray being back were probably the best thing here. So original fans will be able to sit through most of this. Its nice to see everyone back even though the story had problems.",1425686400,,1415,4.363636363636363

It felt like Callum Blue and Jasmine Guy were just trying to hard but could never get into character.

It was as if the writers hadn't realized that die hard fans have watched every episode over and over again and they remember things from the first season, even if the writers don't.  Like, the first half of the first season was about George creating cosmic chaos that someone had to clean up when she tried to get out of reaping someone, but now the same people are supposed to believe that nothing will happen.  Anyone remember all those dead people stuffed into Roxy's little meter maid cart?  And then there's the Daisy character.  Not Bryan Fuller's character, most likely, but then if you're not going to even try to get the character, why not write a new one for Sarah Wynter?  Because Daisy would never have gotten drunk before a performance, among other things they got wrong about her.  She was way more layered.  Oh, and the sappy love story about Reggie and her boyfriend.  Dead Like Me is edgy, not sappy.

There was the new film location.  They film everything in Vancouver, B.C. where the series was filmed.  Why couldn't they have done the film there as well?  It just gave a different feel to the film.  I didn't expect the film to be identical to the series after that much time, but this just looked like the creators didn't even bother to go back and look at the earlier story and the result was jarringly illogical.",1412726400,,1418,4.509803921568627

3660288,5,B001JV5BHQ,"I wish they had given us better closure, but at least one major story arc from the TV series was brought to a logical confusion ...

I mean ...

... brought to a logical conclusion

(and yes, I accidentally typed confusion, didn't notice it for several minutes, but decided to leave it there).

and they gave us one more area of agreement between the book(s) and TV/Movie series.

It might help that I've read seven of the books that include Death (Thanatos) as a character, ""On a Pale Horse"" was the inspiration for the TV series, but Death shows up in the other books as a minor character, and some of the details of the movie that some people complain are part of the book.

In the book, Zane, the human who became the Incarnation of Death when he accidentally murdered his predecessor, was able to reveal himself to human beings as being both his human identity and his immortal identity. At other times, he could choose to appear to be human only. In ""Tangled Skein,"" the third book in the ""Incarnations of Immortality,"" Fate revealed herself to members of her human family, and told them that she was an Immortal. In the fifth book, ""Green Mother,"" the woman who would eventually become Mother Earth, had a group of human friends who knew that she would become Gaea before it happened.

So, it doesn't bother me that George revealed herself to her sister. The hints were there throughout the TV series that Reggie suspected that Millie was George, so it made perfect sense to me that Reggie would find out for sure. Remember, in a number of episodes, Reggie saw Millie (George) and always seemed to notice when George was outside their house. There could have been a kind of mental connection between the sisters, since they rarely talked in life, and since Reggie idolized her older sister. Reggie did, on several occasions tell people that George was still around and that she was not a ghost, so the ""great reveal"" in the movie might have been planned for the third season that never happened.

One problem I had had with the TV series was the idea that everybody had to find jobs in order to exist as Immortals. In the books, the Immortals had no need for money. Each immortal had their own method of transportation from place to place, and if they needed something from a human, people would see them as someone that should receive what they needed when they needed it.

Though Cameron was obnoxious, he did provide a logical improvement to their existence. The grim reapers did not need to work their human jobs in order to pay the rent and buy meals. They now had free transportation and presumably everything they needed for their daily existence.

I did not like Rube's replacement near as much as I had liked Rube himself. At least they gave us a logical reason for Rube's departure, his moving on to the next level of ""life."" (Though I haven't yet figured out why he was unavailable for the movie, since I don't remember what he was doing back in 2006)

I only recommend this movie for people who have already watched both seasons of the TV Series. I do not recommend it as a stand-alone movie.",1406160000,,3111,4.567324955116697

This 2009 straight-to-DVD film tries to rectify that injustice with mixed success. The loss of Rube (played by Mandy Patinkin in the series) was clearly felt as his replacement (Cameron Kane played by Henry Ian Cusick) fails to lead and offers little to the plot line. Left rudderless, the reapers bend the rules that Rube had enforced with predictable problematic results. George's decision to reveal herself to her younger sister is a key sub-plot that also comes off awkwardly. For those who loved the series (count me as one) it was an generally enjoyable but uneven fare thee well. For those who were not familiar with the series, the early explication gets them up to speed but the plot development likely makes them wonder why should they care.",1394236800,,920,4.859872611464968

George has matured a lot since the tv show, which makes sense except now she's the most responsible of the reapers. How did that happen?

The new Daisy is absolutely terrible. It would be slightly better if they had given her a new character, since she is not Daisy, but she would've still been a terrible character. Roxy, Mason, and Joy have lost all depth, and just feel like a waste. The plot is pretty weak, as the reapers see what happens when they break the rules, which they already covered in the series because the first few episodes were all about George finding different rules to break.

I will agree with one aspect that was disappointing: The new Daisy is TERRIBLE.  The original Daisy had a softness and innocence underneath her forced cold demeanor that was very endearing. The new Daisy has all the meanness of the old Daisy without any of the charm.  Booooooo!

However, apart from that, this movie stays true to the spirit of the original characters and nicely provides another chapter in the story of Georgia Lass's after-life. It further (and successfully) develops her relationship with her sister, Reggie, in a way that is both touching and heart-wrenching.

Delores Herbig & Murray were the stars of the film. I'd even say that a specific scene with those two was worth the 2-ish hours I spent watching it.

What if the boss wasn't there, what if they saved a life because it improved their real life situation, what if the time they had was too late, what if they were living high on the hog instead of poor... these all couldve been good episodes on their own but rolled into one they lost a lot.

I was very disappointed in the movie the first time I watched it.  The second time it was not too bad.  Now, having watched it for a third time, it's actually pretty good.  I agree with many that Daisy, Daisy Adair was horribly mis-cast and should have either been given her lights, like Rube or they should have waited for the original actress to be available.  I was very pleased that they got most of the original cast back, it made the movie seeing them all again.

I did not like the new boss, I am glad they got rid of him by the end.  I was sorry to see Der Waffle Haus go, maybe it was a chain and they could find another one, I missed Kiffany.  It's too bad there is no fan fiction video as I certain would love to see more Dead Like Me.

The wife and I enjoyed seeing the clocks and the references to time all though the episode.  It was good to see the sisters interacting.  I love that classic red Mustang George drives!

Everytime we watch Dead Like Me the TV series or the movie, we see more that we missed before.  It's a great series and a good movie.  If you loved the series, buy the movie, but don't expect it to be great, expect it to good and you won't be disappointed.

3660574,1,B001JV5BHQ,This is nothing like the TV show. A very poor imitation.  The characters had no depth.  Just an awful movie.  What a waste of money!,1361491200,,132,4.2
3660575,3,B001JV5BHQ,"I was reluctant to view this considering the bad reviews but it was a freebie on Netflix so, why not?

First, the good. The directors reverted back to the Gravelings earlier temperament and mysterious nature. They became more of a sight gag/stale joke by the middle of Season 2.

Georgia, Roxy and Mason play true to themselves for the most part, although Roxie is given a change of character that even the actress had difficulty reconciling with.

Now, the bad. Well, not so much bad as questionable choices. Rube was out and his presence was missed. While I felt his character became too brash near the end of the series I still think he brought some sensibility and continuity to the plot. Without his guidance the group's character changes considerably and when that happens you have to consider how fans might accept that. Well, I'd consider it, the director didn't seem to.

Daisy is played by another actress. Here's another odd choice considering Daisy was a replacement for Betty Rohmer (Rebecca Gayheart). If we've replaced Betty and replacing Rube, why not replace Daisy? What role did she fill considering long time fans could never be satisfied by another actor in the same role? I won't judge the stand in actress so much as the writers/director for trying to convince us a Ford and Chevy with the same name are the same thing.

Reggie is grown up. I didn't recognize Britt McKillup at first but it's the same actress. Only problem is she's normal as chips. She gets along perfectly with her mom which makes a long time viewer like me wonder if the director ever saw the show. True, her older self would likely be better adjusted and get along with her mother better but that tension is what made the Georgia family storyline interesting. Without the tension their scenes are flat and don't move the plot much. Also her 'hidden romance' with the quarterback is... Kind of pathetic. I'm wishing for an early death for the guy but it never seems to come.

Georgia's mom has been kidnapped by an alien. OK, maybe not, but the woman in this movie is not the same character in the series even though the same actress is playing her. Here, Joy Lass is the most patient, understanding, sympathetic woman in the world with time for every little emotional pity party her daughter throws. EVEN if Joy suddenly became best friends with her daughter her underlying tension and impatience would still be there- that's who she is! This was the hardest part for me to watch.

Delores Herbig is the same but she and Georgia have been transplanted from 'Office Space' Happy-Time to what looks like the office Erin Brockowitz got after her firm won the big lawsuit. There are no quirks or mishaps and the scenes could have been filmed in Delores house for better effect. Oh yeah, that might have been funny so they couldn't do that.

And there, perhaps, is the biggest travesty- there is little, if any humor in this production. I'll concede the humor felt a little forced near the end of the series but it was still important, particularly when dealing with a slightly grim topic. The only humor they could muster was the hacking and burning of the Rube replacement- scenes that reminded me more of Goodfellows than a quirky show about grim reapers stuck on Earth munching Waffles.

Lastly, and this is a direct shot at the director, the pace, music and lighting feel WAYYYYYY too much like a Lifetime Channel made for TV movie.

The writers and director claimed they were trying to make something different for the 'big screen'. Well, they got it and the fans got something with the name of their favorite show on it and not much else.",1361318400,,3633,4.6802507836990594

Why did they feel the need to have the Daisey character with a different actress. She could have been explained away with a few word and knowing looks (they all expect to move on unexpectedly) and some new and interesting reapers could have been added. The scenes with george and her sister and then the moment when george was chosen as the head reaper were the only parts that kept the same feeling as the series.

I had the DVD for a while, but only saw it today.  I LIKED IT!  Was it all it could have been?  No.  Could it have been better?  Yes.  In my opinion, all the essential elements were there, however.  Most importantly for the fans I think, is that it gave closure to George and Regina's relationship - something that I had hoped would be addressed in a third season of the original series, but like Death itself - the End came before we were ready to say goodbye.  I think you should it at least see it once, or maybe even a second time, to appreciate the deeper meanings.

The thing I really liked about the show was that it showed us that while death is in many ways unfair, it is however, unfair to ALL.  That is what makes it the Great Equalizer - we will all die eventually.  As George tells her little sister, ""be adventurous, but don't be reckless; you will die evenutally, so why rush it?"".  She shows an inner wisdom that she never would have had, while she was still alive.  Ironic that George had to die, in order to appreciate the life that she had.

The plot so shallowly skimmed the surface of interesting that it was something of a relief when a friend accidentally sat on the remote and turned it off.  The introduction of a new ""Rube"" contradicts insinuations about the workings behind Reapers that were made in the shows.  I cannot say enough against this movie.

3660655,1,B001JV5BHQ,"This was an awful attempt at story writing.  The show's creator has to feel insulted.  The sadistic nature of the television show was completely lost. Hardly any of the issues were resolved, in fact, due to this shoddy attempt to bring some semblance of closure, we are instead left with the feeling that the way the show was left in series two was a much better way for the show to walk into the lights (excuse the pun).  The acting too was just plain awful, as two of the key cogs in the ensemble were missing.  The plot was null, a much better plot would have focused on bringing Rube back from wherever he was, some sort of cosmic kidnapping by an evil reaper, this would have allowed some insight into who ""upper management"" is, a thread we fans will never get to know.  Rube was central to the show, as he brought the mystery into the plot, ie where did ledger come from, who brings the notes, what other bits of information does Rube get about the soon to be dead etc.  Callum Blue, a brilliant actor, was mostly sidelined in this project, which really isn't a bad thing, as, this was, bollucks, as Mason would say.  In fact, the dynamic of the ensemble was amiss, and ellen muth was hardly ever on screen with them.  I understand the need for the reveal to reggie, but, it should have been done in a more clever manner.  Also, do the fans of the show remember why they can't reveal themselves from the first season?  Something about them forgetting memories the more they contact their old life.  Anyway, if you are a fan of the show, you are probably going to watch it, just to see the characters you grew to love, but, they aren't there anymore, seriously, this is garbage.

The characters, who had been developing quite nicely in the series, were slammed (painfully) back in to one-dimensional clowns that were mere shadows of what they had been.

Too many ""forced"" scenes as well.  They clearly showed the rough edges of trying to squeeze too many events into a single script.  Not wanting to spoil anything, I won't describe them here, but there were too many times my reaction was, ""where the hell did THAT come from?""

After reading some of the reviews before I watched the movie, I was anticipating the worst. But whatever to all the negative reviews, I loved it!
I was smiling throughout the entire movie, I missed these characters soooo much and it felt like ""old times"" watching them again. Of course the character of ""Daisy"" sucks, but in my mind, this wasn't Daisy at all, just some other female reaper that took her place. That was definitely a mistake on the creators to try to pull that one off, who the hell would ever be able to suspend belief and imagine that as Daisy? But, if you go into it just imagining the actress as a different reaper I don't think it will bother you as much.
Not having Rube was sad as well, but they made his departure acceptable, and the new boss was an interesting character. I have to admit that I get my fix of Rube (Mandy Patinkin) by watching Criminal Minds, so I wasn't as bothered by that as I may have been.
Being able to see Reggie all grown up was awesome as well. I always thought she was pretty, but to see the character grow up and become this BEAUTIFUL and independent woman was so cool :D
It was a real treat to be able to put some kind of closure in my mind to the story and to be able to see all my favorite characters again, and the ending with the Metisse song Boom Boom Ba had me in tears.

Half the characters (including a sorely missed Mandy Patakin -- who you can't fault for missing this train wreck) from the original series are either MIA or replaced by new actors.  Come on -- really?  Did ya really think we wouldn't notice???

The plot is inanane and at that it is slightly better than the diaglogue.  Where the series was fresh and charming and witty in a dark-ish yet feel good sort of way, this movie is flat as the comic book opening that one would suppose was meant to be cool and edgy but failed horribly.

Just goes to show, while writers in Hollywood may not have the power of producers -- they still can make or break a project.  In this case, they broke it.

I didn't have my expectations set that high.
Like a lot of you I also love both seasons that were on.
Without going into great detail here is what I didn't like about this movie.

I knew right off the bat I wasn't going to care for the direction of the movie with the comic book feel which is totally wrong for ""DLM""
Where's the original music?
Would ""Cheers"" or ""The X-Files"" be the same without their tradmark songs?
I think not, same here with ""DLM"".

Where's Rube?
I hated his replacement.
The new Daisy? UUGH!!!
They burned down the waffle house?
Der Waffle House???
How dare they?....Blasphemer's!!!
Big slap right there.
Happy Time was also apparenty remodeled to the point of being unrecognizable.
The George the the world saw was also a different actress. Hated that too.
I just didn't care for the story at all.
Sorry but George and her sister shouldn't be interacting.
That ruined the whole thing for me right there.
George's dad wasn't in the film either.
Rule # 1, if you can't get the original cast back for a reunion show, THEN DON'T BOTHER!

What did I like?
I liked the fact that the characters aged as they would in real life.
It was interesting to see where George's family was after all this time.
A lot of the emotional impact of the show was intact.
The story itself was...blah.

Really, the only way they could redeem this whole thing is to come out with a new movie and have this whole scenario be some kind of test from Rube and none of it happened for real.

I also read that an option for a third tv season was left open after making this movie.
I really, and I mean REALLY hope they go in this direction.
Even if it's only one more season to close all the loose ends for our reapers.
I'd love to see the show end on a proper note with all of them seeing their lights and the hows and whys they were left behind as reapers in the first place.

In reality you could continue this series forever with different casts of reapers.
Oh well...we can only wait.
Either do another movie and do it right or just bring back the show.

3660683,2,B001JV5BHQ,"I can still remember hearing about the follow-up movie they were making for Dead Like Me. Being Dead Like Me is my favorite TV series and there were talks of possibly doing a third season if the movie did well enough (though I never believed they really would if you want to know the truth), I was excited.

Now I find myself sometimes literally forgetting it even exists. I'm not saying this as to trash the movie but just as an honest, truthful, and literal observation.

In DLM: LAD, we find ourselves and our favorite grim reapers still in Seattle a few years post the series. Sadly, we find out that Rube got his lights literally just before the movie begins and the reapers find out they have a new boss, Cameron Kane, who is a far cry from Rube and his leadership traits (but is intentionally done so).

It's with Cameron that a good bulk of the plot revolves, or at least half. Eventually all the reapers come to agree with George that Kane needs to go and they (sans George) set out to get rid of him any way possible.

Then we have the family side of the plot. Reggie is now in her mid-teens, no longer really that ""odd child"" she was in the series but is still more or less far from being popular, and is secretly dating a football player who is dating a popular girl who dislikes Reggie. Joy has turned her grief over George into helping other families and parents in similar situations. Clancy only gets a passing mention as having moved on and has a new family now.

Mostly however, the movie deals with Reggie finally discovering George is still around and is a grim reaper.

Of the two, I enjoyed the George/Reggie plot better and I wish it had been the primary focus.

Admittedly, there wasn't many things I can say I particularly liked about the movie. There weren't many, if any, moments that made me ""laugh out loud"", for example. Probably the one thing I can say I really liked was they managed to give real conclusion to the series, at least for George, if this turns out to be it for DLM. I won't ruin what happens to her, but it pretty much is a great way to conclude her arc as a grim reaper.

As for what I particularly disliked, I'll start off with Rube and Daisy. This is probably the most commonly agreed item about what was wrong with the movie. Rube (Mandy Patinkin) was not in the movie at all. His absence was missed. Then there's ""Daisy"". Like Mandy Patinkin, Laura Harris was unable to return due to other commitments. Unlike Rube, however, they simply replaced the actress.

Now, I don't know how well of an actress the woman is as this is the only thing I've seen her in. Nonetheless, she was not a very good actress for Daisy. It was almost like watching a completely different version of the character seen in the series.

Then there are the reaper rules. Pretty much every rule set up in the show was thrown out the window for the movie. A good example is during one scene, a man is trying to leave his body without being reaped by a reaper. I kind of see it as negating a lot of why reapers are necessary.

There was one instance of something that could be very important happening which is Mason getting recorded taking several bullets but walking away just fine. It's never brought up at all, which is odd considering how much reapers need to remain a secret.

All in all, it's not a horrible movie but I've seen better. As much as I love the series, I was pretty disappointed in the movie.",1299715200,3,3433,4.372056514913658

Within the first 5 minutes of the movie I realized Mandy Patinkin was not going to be making an appearance, and this was the first of many flaws in this movie. It was poorly put together, and the characters we grew to know and love within the original show, were cheap imitations of themselves. Bottom line do not watch if you loved this show, what ever ""closure"" this might offer, it leaves you empty and with a bad taste in  your mouth.",1297036800,,506,4.216494845360825

3660686,2,B001JV5BHQ,"As there have already been 239 reviews written before mine, the chances that anyone will even get to my review is quite slim.
However, I enjoyed the show so much and my daughter did, that I also felt that I needed to do a review of this movie.
That Mandy, who played Rube, and the actress who played Daisy in the series were not in this movie, was such a big let down, and I completely agree with the others, who have said that the actor and actress they put in, ""as replacements"" were simply not at all good actors, and also not the least bit fun or even interesting.
The character Rube, always had such a caring, fatherly humanity to him, and the character Daisy had been allowed to develope from a self centered person into a really caring and decent person, who had feelings for Mason.
NONE of that was in this movie.
And, the story made no real sense.
The reapers, who had always been told by Rube, that their purpose was a ""good"" one, in that they removed people's souls before they died, so that they then didn't suffer, and then gave them guidance and helped them to make the journey that they needed to make to the light.
That was not here.
And, then for the group to decide that the ""solution"" for them, as they didn't like their new boss, was to murder him??
First off, aside from it being shown that he was uncaring and self centered, there was NEVER anything at all in the movie, as far as his behavior went, that could have even remotely been enterpreted as ""justifying"" him being murdered by them.
And, they had always been shown to be good, decent caring people.
They had never been ""murderers"", at all.
The only time that anyone had ever been ""killed"" was when a truely ""evil"" man had hooked up with Daisy, and then when she tried to break things off with her, he had attacked her and tried to kill her.
Mason had come to her rescue and saved her life, but in the process of doing so, had become so angry at the man, that he had accidentally killed him.
Then something evil had come out of him, an evil ""graveling"", which were the things that did kill people, and it was kiling people and tried to kill mason. That was when George told him that she wasn't afraid of him, and said, ""I never did like you."" and ran her hand over his arm the same way that they did in order to take people's souls.
But as he had NO soul, in his case it just caused him to disinegrate.
But, they never intentionally killed anyone.
So what the script had them doing was completely against their characters, and caused them to not be seen as the caring people they had been in the series.
There was never any explaination of why Rube was gone either, and at the end, when they were speculating, about, now that they had murdered their ""Reaping Boss"" they now didn't know what was going to happen to them next, hundreds of blank postems float down all over George?
What exactly is that supposed to mean?
And then she says, ""Oh, I am SO screwed.""
Well, again, ""WHY??""
As Rube always gave them postems with the names of the people they were to reap, the address of where it would happen, and the ""TOD"" for ""time of death"", so they could find them, an unanswered question could have been, ""Who was it, who gave Rube the information for him to pass on to the Reaper?""
That was never answered.
If postems had fallen with the information on them, then you could figure that possibly, it was now going to be George's responsibility to do Rube's job. But they were all completely blank.
The series was great. But, especially with the time that has passed, since the series was on, it isn't going to be brought back.
ALL of the orginal characters all seemed to have been so well chosen for their parts.
Every single one, seemed to be so believable, and completely well developed as people, and the interactions between the family members were SO real. We found ""ourselves"" in the series over and over, in the ways that the parents and girls interacted.
In the movie, NONE of that was there.
The only part I liked at all, was that George did finally talk to her sister.
All through the series, by her leaving things for her sister, she had, already contacted her, and her mother, in various ways, so that her sister, knew that she was around.
Why not at some point allow her, and them, to know that she existed, and that she was alright, and happy in her new life, and looking over them?
And then, because they would have that comfort, they would be finally able to ""move on"".
That was the only good part of the entire movie, and the only part that made any sense.
Great actors and actresses from the series were given a really stupid movie that made no sense at all to do, and had to do it without two major characters from the series.
A major disappointment, especially when we all, who loved the series so much, knew how great a movie they could have made with just a little more effort.",1296345600,5,4873,4.344298245614035

The replacement actor for Daisy was awful.
Not having Mandy Patinkin in the movie at all really was stupid as his character Rube and the portrayal of that character was the heart and soul of the series.
I like the other three reapers, but the script was poorly written. They tried to save this dead in the water script, but all they could do is take the soul and hope for the best.

I couldn't care less that the actor that played daisy wasn't the original. Suck it up retards, as you can just pretend it is just her projection on the outside world. The real travesty this film makes is that they invented a character with the same name as a great character from the series, and scrambled her brains turning into a brainless bimbo. I have lost all integrity for anyone who gave this movie above 2 stars. It really says something about a movie when the most emotional part is when the cat of a character, whose sole purpose is comic relief, is put to sleep. Oh well, i just needed to write something to give this worthless movie what it deserves, one star.",1287619200,,828,4.314102564102564
3660776,1,B001JV5BHQ,"It's awful!! HOW can it be SO BAD with such wonderful series material? That is really a mystery.

Why the comic book presentation? Perhaps it goes back to Rube. Not only is Mandy Patinkin missing from the movie, it appears that he also refused permission to use his image in flashbacks. Cartoon drawings would solve that dilemma, but notice that they appear to be purposely drawn to NOT look like him at all. Why? Was he really ""Unavailable"" --or just horrified by the script? We don't know.

As someone mentioned, it looks like it was filmed on the cheap from a first draft -- with no money or time to finish the writing. Why? And what would have happened if they had finished? Where were they originally going with this? Why is it chopped into so many unrelated pieces?

Rube's ""replacement"" is a devilish character, tempting our merry band of Reapers with everything they want -- food, alcohol, sex, star recognition, a seductive kiss -- while pooh-poohing everything they've done or believed for years or decades. This potentially intriguing setup comes down to a reverse murder mystery: ""HOW do you kill someone who's already dead?""

Why blow up Der Waffle Haus? Probably for the same reason George's headstone is transplanted to a totally different (and apparently cardboard and bluescreen) cemetery. To save money on recreating or renting original sets and locations? It also  eliminates the kind and sensible Kiffany, one less actor to pay.

When the Daisy character flubs her lines as an inept Lady Macbeth, why do they have her break into a jig and a goofy segue into ""Old MacDonald . . . E-I-E-I-O!"" Cringe.

It is SO phenomenally bad that one must wonder if it was actually INTENDED to be bad. But why? And what's the motive?

I believe this DVD should be treated as a ""retro-active crime scene."" Look for the high risk factors: cancellation, a direct-to-DVD with the carrot of seasons in the future, but low budget NOW.

They appear to have spent all their bus money on the Rube Goldberg contraption at the beginning. Perhaps there's a big clue there. Notice the interesting detail of the Eviction Notice on the door. This odd segment took a lot of time to stage but matches NOTHING else in the film. They could just as well have had the Professor flop down on the road or dock or bed like all the other low-budget reapees that follow.

Instead a Creative Genius has built an enormously complex suicide machine. He has a wonderful time watching the mechanics of his dying, then immediately ""gets his lights"" in the form of the applause of the crowd recognizing his earlier contributions -- then he exits, grinning and victorious, stage right. He's outa here!

Any possibility of thinly veiled autobiography? That this disjointed tale is how the Creators gleefully went about killing something that was indeed already dead?

Perhaps the carrot came with too many hoops and vague promises: ""Make a Good Enough Direct > DVD on a Shoestring and MAYBE You'll Get Your Series Back.""

Is it possible that the Creators' response was purposeful and intentional nose-thumbing sabotage / suicide?

It's a mystery! -- and the ONE thing that makes this movie very interesting!",1283731200,4,3176,4.8250460405156534

Four grim reapers meet every morning for breakfast and get their daily soul assignment from their boss on a yellow sticky. One morning a new boss appears and goes high tech and gives out assignment via text messages. The four grim reapers live a duel life, one as a person and another as a reaper. The new boss allows the reapers to break rules. George, played by Ellen Muth (Denise Richards light) reveals herself to her sister when her sister's secret boyfriend dies, or nearly dies in a car crash. I enjoyed the unique story line, the dark comedy, and the personal aspect of the story. I am interested in watching the series.

I'm a big fan of the series.  I fell in love with the show, loved the characters and the actors.. hell, I even liked Daisy.  I truly enjoyed this movie.

But there were a couple things I didn't like.  One thing was the new Daisy, I confess.  The actress did feel a little off and her performance, forced.  Otherwise, the characters felt very familiar except for one moment - where Roxy was very quickly coerced into having a drink with the Commissioner and then turned.  Invasion of the body snatchers, indeed!  ;)

Some have commented that everyone was out of character.  I believe that was actually the point, given one of their own (Cameron) seemed to be getting off on breaking the rules, pulling the reapers' strings, and manipulating the circumstances for his enjoyment.  We've seen the characters, George in particular, break the rules throughout the series.  So, it was actually both disturbing and humorous to watch Cameron turn each reaper into what we're unfamiliar with making his fate in the movie strangely fitting.

In the series, when George wants to reveal she's alive, she forgets quite the parts of her life which she wishes to reveal. It is sad! and her memory of this moment is gone forever.

It really went against everything that was built up in the previous two seasons of the series. Actions and decisions just were totally inconsistent with the characters. I actually can't believe that the original writers came up with this. If I wasn't such a fan of the series, there's no way I would have watched this entire movie.

There's the person who seems to want something they cant have. Then there's the one who has what they need but needs something else. The other people are there along for the ride, and then throw in some good plot, a cool amount of special effects, and keep the pace going so you don't lose the audience. This is actually a funny story that is a made for cable TV production, so most of us non-cable subscribers would usually not even bother watching some of these type of genre.
The main character is a twentyish something female, who had a accident that left her with the option of working for Death himself. As a survivor of accidents/suicide/deaths, the other characters are doing a job of helping people along in their own deaths. It doesnt sound like much of a story, but once you see one of the episodes, you are either: ""Hooked"", or will fast forward(uh, I mean click to the main menu) and watch the extras. I would recommend this one for people who are already into (not soap operas , or reality tv, or made for tv movies) but the other crowd that enjoys mainstream movies with-out the huge budget, mainstream actors, and general 'predictability' that goes along with the usual 'fodder' of holly-would.

George comes in and they all speak on mundane crap and off-handedly talk about the new reaper.

Viewers mouths hang agape....oh em gee....

The possibilities of George playing mentor to Delores, a genuine shifting of roles for the two, and the closeted Delores' first days of reaping could only send this movie rocketing skyward.

Deletion of this Cameron fiasco. No idea what that was all about. Instead, the mere absence of Rube sends the group spinning off-kilter to manage reaps without the filter that Rube provided. The only thing left is how to incorporate the ""how to kill a dead guy"" montage which was awesome.

But he said he heard the movie was not good, and that they didn't have some of the original actors in it.  I thought people just couldn't suspend reality enough to get over a different actor playing the same role and expected to like it and love the loose ends being tied up.  As a fan of the Firefly series (great show), I absolutely loved the excitement and closure the movie Serenity offered to that series-- and it was a great movie on its own even if you never saw the series.  I guess I was spoiled and expected the same from the Dead Like Me movie.  But really it was hard to even get through this movie because it was so bad.  Early on I realized that not only was it a bad movie, but it would not put closure to the show.  I kept plugging through it just to finish it so I wouldn't have to wonder, though.  I ended up calling my brother and telling him not to bother seeing the movie, though I'll give it to him for free if he wants to ever punish himself.  First, the replacement actress is not even a problem for me-- though I did find her annoying... what was the real problem, though, was the lack of character in any of the reaper characters!

It was so poorly and cheaply written that I'm actually shocked it was done by some of the same writers as the series.  It was a shameful movie to a great series.

I REALLY wanted to like this movie after reading some bad reviews but I simply can't, it is a disgrace to the original show. There is so much wrong with it, it's like they took the souls out of Mason and Roxy... George turned into some flashy high powered office b!@tch... And the actress that played Daisy was so bad, not just for dumbing her down but her sheer acting ability made me cringe every time she opened her mouth. Why did they cast her! WHY!?!!?

Then there's ALL the laws they broke. Season one set us up with a world of reapers and we ""got it"". Then they tore it all down in the movie, making Roxy mess with the laws the way she did was outrageous. And how the heck could George tell Reggie about her memories, that was so lame and disappointing. I am still reeling from it now. TO add insult to injury, not only did they pee all over the original rules laid down by the TV show, they changed all the sets so absolutely nothing was familiar. Der Waffle House was burned down without explanation, and the set of Happy Time, the Lass House, and even George's grave were all new unfamiliar sets. It was like they were deliberately trying to mess it all up.

But there was also a lot of messed up things about that storyline as well. Basically, I'm so disappointed with the way they butchered the characters. I really wanted to like this movie. I really did.

For me, the whole movie was pretty much ruined by Daisy Adair being played by a new actress who didn't understand the character. Daisy is definitely ""friendly"" in the series, but she has a heart and insecurities, and that's why people love her. This movie's version of Daisy doesn't have the heart, and loses her charm. It might have been better to leave the series as it was. This movie has it's moments, but it's too far from the show.",1257379200,,565,4.339622641509434

George is as good looking as ever and has grown up a lot. Roxy is the same as ever to start with, gets lost for awhile then starts kicking ass again. Mason has grown up a little but is still pretty much the same. I miss the Der Waffle House but it wouldn't be the same without Rube in it. I miss Rube and cant stand the guy that takes his place so what they do to him in the end is fine. Overall I really liked the movie and I'm glad that I bought the DVD.

So I'm probably one of the handful, at most, of people who came into this having never seen a single episode of the TV show to which this is an extended epilogue. This despite thinking that Ellen Muth is outrageously cute. But what can you do? I never had Showtime. I actually recorded this thinking it was the original pilot (and that someone was finally going to show the series on basic cable). Seems I was, well, a tad wrong. I've spent pieces of the last half-hour reading about how much worse than the show it is. Must have been an incredible show. I missed all the plot inconsistencies and the like, obviously. I have no idea about the rules of this universe. Coming into it cold, it wasn't bad. It wasn't good, mind you, but it wasn't bad.

I'm not going to stick to my usual review format for this, because giving a plot synopsis seems redundant. And because of all the stuff I read about plot holes, etc., which makes me think that if you haven't seen the series, pretty much anything I say about the movie is going to be a spoiler. Thus I'll stick with commenting on the acting (generally decent, though no one was truly great), the script (I'll leave it to the experts to discover plot inconsistencies; I found it half-witty and half-treacle), the the direction (competent). My usual stuff, in other words. I did kind of expect more, after all the wonderful things I've heard about the show, but rather than taking it as a feature film I took it as an extended TV show episode; looked at that way, I found it at least enjoyable enough to keep watching. It ain't House, or even the last few seasons of The X-Files, but watchable nonetheless. ** ",1255478400,,1705,4.47588424437299

I was ultimately disappointed when they decided to cancel such a great series. When I heard they were going to make a movie, I perked up a bit, and got even more disappointed when I watched it. I have lost the plot, the storyline, the funnies/sarcasm was gone! The character change was a huge blow to me since...well...no matter how much you act, you can't be like the original (ex: daisy). I am fine with the series I already own, but I won't be looking to add the movie to my collection.",1254787200,,595,4.228070175438597

3660883,2,B001JV5BHQ,"After watching every show from both seasons, and then this follow-up I just felt incredibly dissappointed.  It felt exactly like reading a good book and then going to watch the movie.  Some characters were great.  Reggie and Delores, for example.  And I really like that they had Joy write the book and become a counselor for other parents who've lost children.  But George didn't seem to have her heart in the part and Daisy needed to just go.  They had no problem ditching Rube - and even the Der Waffle House..  Why not get rid of Daisy instead of bringing in this shallow airhead?  And what the #@)) happened to Roxy's balls?

I had to watch it, to see for myself.  I saw the unimpressed reviews, but after the series I wondered how bad it could actually be.. I'm going to have to go back and watch the last show from Season 2 to get this taste out of my mouth.  I give this movie two stars for the attempts of the actors and actresses that made the voyage over from the series..  Alas, that is all we get in this movie - some attempts.

they also changed directors the new director  tries to turn the visual appearence of the  show into a video graphic novel complete with ridiculous comic book layout graphics  and the music was different  they even changed the intro music.

3660916,1,B001JV5BHQ,"This movie was barely mediocre at best. As soon as you hear Ellen (George) Muth's narrative voice, you'll notice that she sounds uninterested. Well , that's probably because the movie is uninteresting. Daisy's character is destroyed (now she's just some superficial airhead who lost all of her moral development as an individual), and Rube, one of the vital characters central to the balance of Dead Like Me, has randomly received his ""lights"" without any sign of a farewell. It's just not like him. In fact, none of the characters really stay true to their original selves. If you're a fan of the series, you'll most likely be disappointed, especially if you were actually attached and understood the characters. If you get a chance to watch the Special Features on the DVD, you'll notice that the new director states that he was ""trying something new""...well, it clearly didn't work. To reiterate:

SPOILERS BELOW:

PROS:
-George finally meets and talks with her sister
-Dolores Herbig is still the same old lovable woman
-George is made the new boss of the reapers at the end

CONS:
- Rube is gone and he is replaced by some European ""suave"" gentlemen, or should I say [...], who is killed at the end anyways....yes, reapers can die now!
- Der Waffle House is gone (randomly burned down)
- Little to no connection with the original series
- Daisy's character is completely ruined
- Roxy is out of character
- Stewart Copeland is no longer the musical composer (the music sucks...)

BASICALLY THE SHOW HAS LOST ITS MAGIC. The variables that made it Dead Like Me have all been altered or removed.

Really enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 of this show. Just finished watching this follow-on movie and it's really got me riled up. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life! Absolute rubbish and an insult to a viewer's intelligence. Where do the maker's get off in substituting characters with other actresses (Daisy) and totally replacing Rube. I'd rather the show ended at season 2 than be left with this movie drivel. Wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their money buying this stupid movie.",1250640000,4,606,4.716981132075472
3660918,4,B001JV5BHQ,"For the most part, ""Dead Like Me: Life After Death"" is every bit as good as the series, but it also welcomes newcomers with open arms.  As nostalgic as watching it is, it's also a new beginning for both the characters and the audience.  There is a lot of emotion here, and if you're anything thing like me--that is, invested in these characters--it just might make you weep.

An interesting bit is that some of the plot lines from the series are paid off, such as some stuff with Murray and George's family.  There is a lot of closure here for Reggie and her mother, so if you felt the finale of the series lacked... well, finality, you might be happier with this.  It's by no means a definite end, as there is definitely more to be said about the characters, but if it did end here, I would be satisfied with the story that was told.  I loved the majority of the show, but I did feel that the second season had trouble blending the humor and drama in an organic way, but the movie--for the most part--is able to pull it off.

Now, onto the not so shiny stuff.  We've got no Rube and we've got no Laura Harris to play Daisy Adaire.  Sarah Wynter fills in for Harris, and she does a better job than I expected, but the whole same-character-different-actor thing is too strange for me.  They wrote around Rube, and should have wrote around Daisy.  Also, the continuity is iffy.  The repercussions of a reap left un-reaped were made clear in the pilot, and the ""you lose your memories when you talk to your family"" clause is gone, though I suppose the last one can be explained.  Maybe a higher power knew George had to talk to Reggie?  I don't know.  It should have been addressed, but it wasn't.

""Dead Like Me: Life After Death"" will definitely please longtime fans, but it will probably annoy them too.  It works nicely as an epilogue to everything that came before, but it also gives the characters a new start.  Showtime, please give this show life again!

For starters, you can't replace a main character...Daisy Adair..and throw in somebody else who looks and acts very slightly like her.  ...Then you can't just say that Rube is just gone (saw his lights) and throw in some new cheesy Europen-looking guy as the head honcho.... and even first thing say the waffle house burned down.

However, this movie simply showed the gap left when key actors decided to chase other projects, and not participate in this movie.  Oh yeah, I found, the substitution of a new actress to play ""Daisy"" was a VERY bad move, as the original actress brought subtle nuances to the role that could not be replaced by simply inserting another actress into the role.

Heck, I could moan about how disappointed this movie left me all day, but that won't help anyone who is thinking of wasting their money on this dead dog (as I did).  So, I'll just say this; ""Life after Death"" is a perfect candidate for a ""Netflix"" rental however, I found it a dismal, and disappointing  purchase.

Sarah Wynter utterly fails to grasp the part of Daisy. Poor writing for Roxie and Mason, not enogh for Joy, and just ok for Reggie. Delores was great!!

While the movie does have it's positives; Dolores is exactly the same and brings a smile to your face, the friendly chemistry of Mason and George that is basically un-killable is still there and George is her usual cynic self, the movie isn't even a watered down version of the series, it's just bad.

Starting out, Daisy is played by another actress, a woman who doesn't quite pull the character off and as Rube also did not return, I question the motives of the writers for not just replacing her in the story.

Add this to the fact that the plot is loose, they got stuck with a bad director and the writers had the characters doing out of character actions over and over again. They even negate certain plot points in the past episodes of the series which creates puzzlement and surprise. This movie is a quick forget in the Dead Like Me saga.

It's hard to say whether the problem with the character is more due to the writing or how the actor, Sarah Wynter, portrayed her. But the performance is worse than Daisy's theater debut...E-I-E-I-O.

Britt McKillip did a fine job as Reggie. I liked the interaction between George and Reggie...but shouldn't breaking the rules bring ""Reapercussions""???

1) 2/5 of the original main cast is gone, and they have the nerve to replace the unavailable Laura Harris with Sarah Wynter who is possibly the worst actress ever.  Wynter tries to emulate Harris's portrayal but she doesn't even come close to Harris's award-worthy and brilliant performance in the tv show.  Rube has moved on to whatever the Reapers eventually move on to so the new head Reaper is Cameron Kane, some slimy businessman who makes them use blackberrys instead of post-its. I love Desmond but here he's just no good. at least he's only in like 4 scenes, yet somehow is a major part of the overall ""plot"" if you can even call it a plot...

2) ...the ""plot"" which makes no sense and completely goes against everything the original show was about.  kane explains to the Reapers that basically they can do whatever they want since they're dead, and that Rube's warnings of fire and brimstone if they broke the rules was actually complete bull.  thus, the Reapers start doing whatever they want and breakin all the rules which totally contradicts one of the major themes of the series.  i'm especially surprised at roxy who does some things here the original law-abiding and sensible roxy would NEVER do.  the other major plot is that george reveals herself to reggie which AGAIN goes against the entire show's concept that they now have to move on and lead different lives. george's awkward and contrived bonding with reggie takes up like 1/2 the movie.

3) atrocious acting by everyone. wynter as i already said was vomit-inducing (i don't know why they just didn't wait til harris and patinkin were available, considering how much of the show is about the characters). callum blue who plays mason looks like he's just going through the motions without enthusiasm, ellen muth who plays george is more bored and manlier than ever, and jasmine guy who plays roxy just feels off her game. the acting is easily 1/2 of what made the tv show so phenomenal, but here they all just seem so uninterested in their roles.

But a few days later it comes back, alive again.  This seems like a good thing.  But even though it looks like your cat, something is different.  It has changed, and not in a good way.  There is something dark and black about it, now, and as hard as you try to recapture the warm and fuzzies you had for your sweet kitty, the more elusive they become.  Instead, you are eventually forced to realize that what has returned to you is not the love of your life, but a fetid, malignant evil from the mouth of hell.  Such is this return of ""Dead Like Me.""

What a wonderful, quirky TV show it was.  What a horrid, depressing movie this is!  It's as if they took your favorite food and removed all the taste and tripled the calories, then added a little syrup of ipecac.

3661019,1,B001JV5BHQ,"I was excited to see this movie when i had read of it's upcoming release, since the series ended abruptly and left so many (agonizing i might add) loose ends.
Thank god i just downloaded the thing because i would have been pretty mad if I had dropped twenty bucks on this movie.
The idea is a nice one: give the fans their closure, answer all the unanswered questions, etc... But it was just done so poorly that it left me feeling worse than i did when i didn't have any answers at all.
First off Rube did not make an appearance at all and the actress who played daisy was also missing.
Rube's importance in the show and the gaping balck hole his absence left in the film is obvious, but what really bothered me was daisy. In the show daisy only appeared vacant on the surface, but we were jsut beginning to scratch the surface of what turned out to be a really complex and interesting character when the series was cancelled. In the movie she is a bubbleheaded two dimensional moron and i was glad that she hardly had anything to do with the movie since i could hardly watch her without wincing.
The real pinnacle of the movie came when george FINALLY reveals herself to Reggie. Any other fan of the show was, i'm sure, as agonized as i was watching george stand at the end of her old driveway, passing reggie in the street, sitting on her old porch, and nopt being able to say anything. Yet when the big moment came in the movie it was jsut so...
cheap. Did they shoot the movie on a rough draft of the script? was the script nothiung more than sloppy fan fiction they decided to shoot? I honestly don't know, but it was such a let down i honestly wish this movie had never come out, as all the wonderful possibilities i had to dream about were so much better than the answers we wound up with.

As I said before, I understand and appreciate the sentiment behind the making of the movie... But I think if they couldn't do it right then it jsut shouldn't have been done at all.",1240963200,,1978,4.274666666666667

There's really no plot. The writers bring in the replacement for Rube and seem to want him to be the antagonist. But he's not. His role gets washed out. At the end there's no clue as to what he was doing, why he was chosen to replace Rube. Just some wannabe philosophical garbage about butterflies and tidal waves.

The situation with George's family was not wrapped up. She meets Reggie, avoids Reggie, tries to kill Reggie (yeah, the old cliche about healing suicidal people by trying to kill them). They talk about some shoes. Nothing really happens, though.

The writers never explain why George couldn't reap that kid's soul. From the series we know that reapers can grab the soul of anyone, even those not scheduled to die. For some reason though, George can't with this kid until he confesses his feelings for Reggie. Oddly, George doesn't even share that with Reggie - instead George insults the kid.",1240272000,,1177,4.595238095238095

As others mentioned, Rube is not present in this show, but with a decent explanation.  Daisy is a bit different- but that can be expected with a new actresses.  Ellen does a terrific George- as expected.

3661026,1,B001JV5BHQ,"A couple of months ago I there was a marathon solely devoted to Dead Like Me on the Sci-fi network. I was intrigued, and began to watch it. They only wound up showing a couple of episodes from the first season. Needless to say, it only took those couple of episodes that got me hooked on the show. I immediately got a hold of the complete two seasons and watched them with delight. The characters were fun, funny and each brought their own individual personality. I thought there was something very charming about a young 18-year-old girl being a grim reaper. Some of the deaths shown were just laugh-out-loud hysterical. When I saw the last episode, I was a bit sadden on the fact that there was no more season after that. Overall it was just a fantastic experience, and a hell of a show.

(spoilers)
Recently I saw this movie (DLM: Life After Death). As a current fan of the original series, I must say that this watching this straight-to-DVD movie was the worst thing that could have possibly happen to the show. First of all they no longer met at the safe and comfy atmosphere of the famous waffle house (on a count that they had it go up in smoke). Then for some reason they killed off Rube (played by Manny Patinkin), most likely because Patinkin was either too busy to do the movie or just didn't want to be apart of it. Why did this upset fans of the show, for the simple reason that Rube was the glue that held the entire crew together. He was essentially the father figure and the one they always went to for advice. No Rube meant that there wasn't that stability that the show was known for. Thirdly, they replaced actor Laura Harris who played the drop-dead-gorgeous Daisy Adair with a woman who is not charismatic or pretty at all.

Overall, I felt that the plot and storyline was just not there at all. The writers failed miserably with this script, and should have never been brought to life. I think the real fans of the show will agree with me on this one.",1240099200,,1973,4.402739726027397

3661028,2,B001JV5BHQ,"Was the pressure to keep the series alive so strong that they believed anything they put out would make money?  Apparently so as this follow-up to the television series carries on in the execrable tradition of David Lynch's ""Fire Walk With Me"" sequel to the delightful ""Twin Peaks"" series back in the early '90's.

First the high points: hmmm, Cynthia Stevenson and Britt McKillip's characters were reasonably believable in terms of growing over the five-year's that elapsed between the series and movie.  And once again we see why Mandy Patinkin is a great actor - he found a reason not to be in this thing.  And....well, that's about it.

Among the low points:  overexplaining the history (via reading the lines from the comic books as if we can't for ourselves!) when it wasn't needed and underexplaining things when it was needed;  Ellen Muth's first-quarter hairstyle; poor plot development re. Rube's replacement and why on earth didn't they just replace Daisy rather than trying to replicate her character in a totally unbelievable and shallow manner?  And then there was the incredibly stupid idea of Delores Herbig's deceased cat being blasted into space - was there something about Murray that we didn't know to draw an audience for his send-off?  And, then the ridiculous and  gratuitously insulting ending kinda capped off an amazing waste of time and talent.  There's much more, or less, but why go on and waste further time on this thing.

If you liked the series a lot you'll probably want to see this but be forwarned - the franchise is worn out, the writers are tired, the directing and editing is amateurish and, bottom line, there just wasn't much love put into this effort.",1239753600,3,1693,4.881118881118881
3661029,5,B001JV5BHQ,"I went into this with high hopes, after having watched the show and discovering that it only had two seasons to it's credit. After being hooked by the pilot, I quickly grew to love the characters, and eagerly waited to see how things would develop. When the end of the second season began an arc which no doubt would've been explored in the third, I felt like there was more to be told. The final episode was satisfying enough, though not a true conclusion.

The movie starts without Rube, and without the beloved Waffle Haus that the reapers always hung out in. It begins on a brand new adventure with a new number 1 giving out the reaps. He quickly rubs the group the wrong way, and they must learn to live with him... or not.  The return of George's Mother and sister are welcome, and Sarah Wynter does a fabulous job of portraying Daisy Adair, formerly held by Laura Harris. While you know it's physically not her, she pulls off the character just as well.

While I was a huge fan of the too soon cancelled series ""Dead Like Me"", this movie I thought fell flat. For starters losing May Patinkin who played Rube was a huge loss to the cast. Plus the multi-dimensional character Daisy who was originaly played by Laura Harris was replaced by Sarah Wynter in this movie. Sarah Wynter although a fine actress really didn't do the character justice in my opinion; her Daisy came off as just a shallow floozie wherereas, in the series she was deeper than it seemed. Also, the fabulous original director of the series was James Whitmore, Jr., he was replaced in this movie by Stephen Herek and you could definitely tell. In the original series the viewer was really touched and forced to think about life and death, the characters were all finding themselves even in death and growing regardless. In this movie it made a kind of silly mockery of them, like they hadn't grown at all. I was happy they made this movie and there are still some funny parts, but, as a fan of the original I was sadly disappointed in many ways the movie went. Some of the plot was just plain silly and the original characters (the ones you used to know) were totally different people.

The only characters who remained unchanged were to an extent George and of course my favorite the only reason I refuse to trash this movie is the lovable Dolores Herbig.",1239235200,,1451,4.517110266159696

Acting was, as always, excellent and the relationships seemed to have deepened over time - just like they would in real life.  The only real quibble I have is with the replacement for Daisy.

Key cast members are missing, most notably Mandy Patinkin as father figure Rube, and their replacements simply are not up to par. Ellen Muth, deadpan as George doesn't have Rube's affable smarminess to play off of and just comes across as a fraction of the smart aleck she used to be. All the reapers succumb to greed in one way or another at the hands of Rube's replacement with diastrous results, including George, who crosses the line and interacts with her still-grieving sister Reggie.

As I was watching the dvd, it didn't take long for my dream to turn into a nightmare.  I didn't feel it captured the true essence of the series AT ALL.  It was almost like the people who made this movie were just casual fans of the show.  I think the die hard fans could have written a way better movie, without even trying hard!  First, the obvious, NO DAISY.  She was one of my favorite characters ... to replace her with the ""wannabe"" version of daisy was just pathetic.  Honestly, I feel if Laura Harris was unavailable, they should have left Daisy out of the movie all together.  That would have helped the movie a little.  And not having Rube was another huge disappointment, as he was like the father of the group.  The head guy who replaced him in the movie was completely ridiculous.  I was glad when George told Reggie the truth, but the whole storyline with Reggie was so depressing and pointless in my opinion.  I think a better closure/ending for the movie would have been George seeing her ""heaven"" and walking off into it, like all the people whose souls she took in the past.  Now that would have been a satisfying ending.  Whoever made this movie, for future reference, you really should have die hard fans review your movie before its set in stone.  Otherwise, you get this... a million disappointed bitter Dead like Me fans!  If I had known it was this bad, I wouldn't have purchased the dvd.

Aside from that, the entire premise of the movie is that George reveals her identity to her sister, which was clearly stated (and attempted) in the series previously. In addition, the idea of 'not taking the soul' was used already as well. This movie simply does not coincide with the show that I grew to love.

The decision to recast Daisy was not a good one. I didn't like it at all. Also without Rube in it the story just went flat. I wasn't a huge fan of the movie focusing on George and her sister but again -- I was happy to just see the show revisited after being abruptly cancelled which was so unjust in my opinion.

I had the option of buying both seasons, the new movie ""revival"" of the series or both seasons PLUS the new movie in one package. I went with the last choice, thinking it was the best deal.

Big mistake.

I should have just bought the two seasons and enjoyed the heck out of a quirky, affecting, well-written and acted show which just got better with each episode. Instead, I watched those two great seasons and then had to suffer through an abysmal piece of crap movie. Other reviewers here have already described how bad it is -- I can't really add anything to these negative reviews, except to say that even the harshest is probably not harsh enough.

So, I was excited to see this film despite the fact that the Daisy character had been recast and Rube was gone.  I did NOT realize that Bryan Fuller (the creative force behind the show) was not involved in this project.

Because of that, the movie completely lacked the charm, dark wit, and poignancy that made the show so wonderful.  It was a straight-up BUMMER.

What I liked about the series was that it showed respect for death in its own funny way, and their was wisdom to be found in every episode about life itself.  This film totally destroyed that concept and chose instead to play on the viewers emotions by using cheap means like pet euthanasia.  What made the show great were the characters, and this film completely murders them.  I don't fault the actors, I fault whoever wrote this.  It took me awhile to get into the Daisy character (who is played by a new actress here).  She had a sad-charming beauty to her, and at the end of season 2 you could tell that she grew a lot as a person.  In the film her character is reduced to a crazy narcissistic drunk who is SO two-dimensional its laughable.

Movie versions of TV shows are rarely as good as you remember, but I had high hopes for this project, since most of the original cast was reprising their roles, however this film is another example of should have let the show live in our memories and on DVD.  Callum Blue as Mason was as deviantlly  charming as ever and Jasmine Guy, as Roxie was perfect, but the rest of the cast seemed like they were sleep walking through a painful script, made even more painful by the absence of  Mandy Patinkin.  Of course I had to see it, and I guess half-hearted Dead Like Me is better than none at, but I secretly wish they would have left well enough alone.  I say see it if you were a fan of the show, skip it and just get the series on DVD if you just want some great TV.",1237593600,2,890,4.0

The movie is terrible and doesn't do justice to the series.  The actress who replaced Laura Harris as Daisy was horribly miscast.  They should have just left Daisy out, as they did with Rube, and added another character.

Too bad this was such a mess, but at least we had a few moments of Delores Herbig and her big brown eyes to remind us of why the series was so great.",1237593600,,624,4.158333333333333
3661097,2,B001JV5BHQ,"As many other reviewers I loved the series and hated this movie.

For some obscure reason the writers decided to break most of the rules set in place in the series. There is a quasi explanation on the DVD but in breaking the rules it changed the nature of the reapers and the entire way in which they interact with each other and the world.

The biggest golden rule (so to speak) was the reapers could not interact with members of their human life or they would lose their memories. In the movie, Reggie interacts with her sister which would seem to have great depth for a storyline but the entire thing ended up being trite.

The original actress that played Daisy is also replaced and the newcomer just does not measure up. Gone is the ditzy but multi-faceted Daisy and in her place just a ditz. Roxy, who always was the more steadfast of the group, out of the blue, as if never tempted before, grabbed that chalice of wild abandon and drank from it to then ""run a muck."" Mason's wit and playful mischievousness is gone and now he is just there. This leaves us with George as the sole responsible reaper.

Also missing was the romantic undercurrent between Mason and Daisy. It evaporated into thin air along with the cast's dark humor and sarcasm (not the fault of the actors but the fault of the shaky plot and lack-luster writing). In the end, loose ends were left untied, the characters bludgeoned beyond recognition, and the only feeling I am left with is being glad that it is over and wishing I had left the series the way it was and the movie was never made.",1237593600,2,1567,4.430555555555555

Quickly, the group of reapers fall into their own desires while neglecting the rules that they have learned.  The result in each case is some minor obstacle for each reaper that seems to have virtually no bearing on the world at large.  This is in direct contrast to the series, which explained the exponential accumulation of disasters that can occur from a bad reap.  Realizing that their lives have experienced these minor, fleeting annoyances, the reapers decide to torture and murder their new boss.  If you are wondering how they came to this conclusion, I am as well.  Another inconsistency with the series is that George is able to retain the memories of her prior life after she reveals her presence to her sister, something that was shown to be impossible in the first season.  They also replaced Laura Harris as Daisy Adair, but they didn't really need to as her role is so minor, she was barely a part of the story.

Maybe it'll help calm you down.

Since everyone else seems to be handing out spoilers,...
* George has grown up to be quite a fine young lady (from the rebellious teen that she was when she died). I love that she finally got the satisfaction of being a big sister to Reggie. I'm also glad that her new alter-ego doesn't look like a homely crackhead anymore (no offense, whoever played her before).
* Joy is no longer Joy-Less. It always bugged me that her family was always dissing her. Now that she's a single mom, it's nice to see that she's developed some kind of relationship with Reggie. And I'm glad that jerk Clancy is gone.
* I think the storylines were pretty well explained. If you have a pimp for a boss, how else are you going to behave?
* Mason with the chainsaw was classic!
* Notice how much better the movie got when they acted as a team?

But:
* One thing they were starting to develop toward the end of Season 2 was Rube's background. Now that they've killed him off, I guess I'll never get to see how he died...And now that there's no father figure, how will the morals and touching parts of the stories come out? It would've been nice if they could've just made him go on a reaping seminar, or vacation, or something...
* Please stop bashing Sarah Wynter. She's a fine actress that just got boned with bad character info...but then she probably could've researched her character a little better too...They should've just transferred Daisy back to New York and brought back BETTY! Betty rocks! ...and nobody ever found out what happened to her after she jumped.
* Not enough creative deaths! Those were always fun to watch.

Wow, couldn't they have run this through a focus group first? They kinda did make a few bad judgments with this movie, but after having been addicted to the series DVDs, it was nice to see a new incarnation of it. A series based on this attempt may be too much to hope for, but I hope they get at least another movie out of it (then maybe a series).

3661126,4,B001JV5BHQ,"I really loved the short-lived series ""Dead Like Me.""  It managed (at least in its first season) to be touching, funny, insightful, and well...""magical"" often at the same time.  A lot of that had to do with the strong cast, particularly Ellen Muth and Mandy Patinkin.

But something happened in the second season.  The show didn't instantly fall apart, but the story-lines and humor became rather forced and lame in my opinion, and sometimes, death was a little too visceral and too much like a real life news story (I cringed watching the Reapers attend a mass murder at an office).  So I wasn't too surprised to see the series canceled.

But I still remember with great fondness Season One, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see that five years after the fact, they gave the series a finale (or maybe not a finale but just another installment) with this movie.

""Dead Like Me:  Life after Death"" is not perfect.  The absence of Mandy Patinkin, George's gruff but kindly boss, and the woman who played the vivacious but vulnerable Daisy were definitely minuses.  But the rest of the key cast was there and did a great job.  And the story had some touching moments.  Finally, the ending shot is just beautiful (with post-it notes showering George).

So it's worth watching, and if you'll excuse me, I have to pull out my DVD set of Season One and start watching it again.",1237334400,,1376,4.636363636363637

I did not feel however that this movie was in the spirit of the series.  I don't believe many loose ends were tied up and I feel that they changed too many of the ""rules"" set into place, like what happens when you try to communicate with your former life or consequences of killing or not reaping.  There were rules (that were suppose to be unbreakable) that were established in the show that were completely ignored.  I did like the effects and I enjoyed seeing what happened when Roxy forced the man to live.  The actors that could return did a good job with their characters.  The actress playing Daisy, I would not envy her.  She had huge shoes to fill and I just could not accept her during this movie.  I felt that the former actress did a much better job of acting condescending and elitist.  The new actress just seemed childlike and not pained from her lack of love.",1237248000,,1143,4.339622641509434

I was thrilled when it was announced that they were making a ""Dead Like Me"" movie. I ordered it, and watched it, I loved parts of it, and didn't like parts of it at all. Most of this has been bemoaned already her in reviews, so I am going to make a break in my personal rules, and complain about some of the content

SPOILER***
I hated that they used the character of Daisy and not the actress. It clearly didn't work. They should have just written a different character into the story as they did with Rube. It would have made everyone happier.

I missed Rube. MP's character in the show was much more empathetic than his replacement. But then again that was most of the story so...

I loved the resolution between George and Reggie. I felt like that made the whole movie worth buying.

The Whole thing would have worked better in the style of the TV show. They should have forgotten that they were making a feature film. It was being made for the fans of the show, and not going to be shown in theaters, so they should have been true to the audience. The show had for me such a great over-all message about being grateful for every minute of life and the ones you love because you never know. The movie veered off of that theme, and I wish they wouldn't have.

So here's the deal,
Do I wish they would have done the film different? Yes, I do.
Am I glad I bought and watched it? Yes I am.

Although I'm not as devoted as other fans of the series by memorizing the actors's names instead of their character names, seeing the show was akin to reuniting with missed friends.  Those thespians who returned to the movie honored the viewers by reprising their acting roles as if they were shivering skiers donning cozy and fuzzy robes after a long day on the slopes.

  Desapite all this, I believe the movie has ""Jumped the Shark"" or ""Nuked the Fridge"" for the series (It's kinda hard to determine which metaphor is appropriate in this case-- so maybe ""Nuking the Shark"" would be best).

  It's pleasant for fans to see the actors again in their roles, but it's best to let the series pass away quietly after this lone movie.  I wonder if there are reapers for dead tv series?",1237161600,,874,4.587096774193548

The wonderful characters we came to know in the series are - forgive the pun - ghosts of their former selves.  At the end of the series, there were so many questions that could have been explored in a feature length film. Yet, for some reason, the writers decided not to explore anything relevant to the mysteries of life and death.  They simply revisited old scenarios (what happens when you break the rules) while ignoring the rules themselves. And they apparently forgot that these characters already existed in the world of ""Dead Like Me"" for three years.  Did the director even watch the series?  I'm so saddened by this (lack of) effort and so sorry that this wonderful cast didn't get the chance they deserved to shine before a whole new audience.",1236902400,2,889,4.740259740259741
3661158,3,B001JV5BHQ,"Some other reviewers of the film are brutal when they say its the worst film they have ever seen. It is a disappointment to fans of the series because of all the changes in the film from the series. Some changes were explained well like why Rube isn't involved and what happened to the Waffle House.

 I wasn't happy to see the character Daisy recast from Laura Harris who wasn't available for filming at the time to Sarah Winter. Nothing against Sarah, but anyone replacing Laura would have seemed inadequate. The inclusion of Henry Ian Cusick as Cameron Kane was fine to me. Reaping rules set in the series were thrown out the window for unexplained reasons.

 The film fails to draw new fans in as nothing is well explained if you never watched either season of the show. And the films fails to please so called die hard fans because of all the cast and show rule changes. I guess I fall in the middle as I'll say its worth a rental if your a fan of the show.

I'll tell anyone who is a fan to show your support by actually renting it and not pirate the film and decide for yourself if its worth buying. As a fan,I was glad to see the majority of the cast return and shocked and pleased to see how much Britt McKillip grew up since the cancellation of the show. The director commentary with Director Stephen Herek and Ellen Muth through out the film is a pleasant and needed bonus for the dvd and fans.

I watched both seasons of Dead Like Me on Showtime when they first aired and was disappointed to learn season 3 would never be. In fact when I learned it was canceled, it motivated me to cancel my showtime subscription.

Mandy Patinkin, you were missed! The original ""Daisy"" cannot be replaced and they should not have tried. ""Daisy"" was missed. ""Delores Herbig"" is a great character. I think that the writers kinda dropped the ball with the story line. Whatever they needed for the original cast to be there, they should have done it. (Maybe they did the best they could with the circumstances.) I really wish ""Rube"" had been a major part of the story line and the final scene of the ""post-it"" moment could have been his ""passing-on."" I felt a bit let down. I love the cast and I love the original premise. I wish that the writers/producers would show their gratitude to the fans by honoring the characters and their history and relationships. Make it a great show! Make it something to be proud of! Why wasn't ""Rube"" and the original ""Daisy"" there?  .... I personally would not ""download"" this movie. I might buy it ""used."" for under $10. If I didn't already own the seasons, I would buy the complete DVD set, but I doubt I will ever download any movies I CANNOT MAKE A COPY TO WATCH ON MY T.V. WITH, again.",1236470400,,2187,4.16548463356974

The part that really was like the tv series were the scenes between George and her sister, Reggie. In my opinion that was the strongest part of the film. It is definitely worth seeing for fans of the tv series.

The writing was bad, the story was weak, the new Daisy was awful, and the characters' actions simply didn't jive with what the viewer already knows about them.

The other actors tried their best with the material that they were given, but were not able to accomplish much.  No one could.  I hope they were at least paid well.

We were anticipating seeing the movie so our expectations were high. It was great to see the bulk of the cast was the same stars that did the original series. There is a ""comfortable ease"" that is plain to see in their interactions with eachother. However, we were disappointed that Rube was written off and Daisy was being played by another actress (she isn't very good at the role). There is an expectation of changes with the time frame being five years later. Our concensis with this film is that:
a. there needs to either be a revival of the series (? maybe on another channel or financed by another studio?) or another movie
b. the writing lacks the original consistent dark humor that the original series had
c. give other characters some more story time

3661177,4,B001JV5BHQ,"First off, I wanted to write a more positive review, given the many one star reviews just because the movie wasn't exactly like the tv show.  I'm just asking fans to cut it some slack, the movie is actually pretty good if you watch it with an open mind and remember that its been a few years since the series ended.  To me, it did tie up some story lines. The one thing I didn't like was the use of a new Daisy,(in my opinion you should never replace an actor, they should of waited for the original)and no Rube.  But in the movie's defense having no Rube, created a lot of the story line.  It gave Georgia's character new stuff to deal with.  Mind you, yes, a lot of the characters are taken into a different direction than the series, but if you watch the additional footage in the special features, the director explains why they made the decisions they did.  While I may not like every aspect, I did appreciate the effort to bring these characters back, it was like revisiting old friends.  Spoiler Ahead: Given the way the movie ended, seeming like Georgia is the new one in charge,(after the others get rid of the new boss)I think it would be great if the show gets picked up again.  I'm that loyal of a fan. As long as they bring back the old Daisy or bring in a new character altogether.",1236124800,,1295,4.278688524590164
3661178,3,B001JV5BHQ,"I enjoyed it, actually.

To be honest, it stumbles through the first third of the movie. It pulls itself up by the bootstraps by the end to ultimately redeem itself. Because of how rocky the beginning was, though, PLUS the obvious lack of two major characters... I can't really give it more than three stars...

It seemed as though with 5 years between the original series and the movie, even the returning actors were having issues remembering their characters, how they behaved, how they talked, how they acted, pretty much everything. That's natural. It's just uncomfortable to see them tripping all over it, playing caricatures of themselves for the first third (or so) of the film. As the movie goes on, though, they seem to reconnect with their former roles, and it's MUCH more natural.

Overlook that first bit, and it turns into a fairly entertaining joyride. It's not quite movie material... more like an extra-long episode geared toward wrapping up at least a few unanswered questions. It manages this fairly well, bringing closure where it's most needed.

As for Daisy.... I found it much more simple to pretend that she was a different character entirely (who just HAPPENED to also be named ""Daisy""). She looks different, the mannerisms are different, the way she's written is different. I found her to merely be annoying rather than the utter ruination of the movie when viewed from that angle. She's...allright, I guess. She's just not Daisy Adaire. I guess that's just how it's going to have to be.

My only other gripe was that the baddie.... just didn't seem very believable to me. As written, he was just purposelessly evil. His only point was to give George a reason to behave as she did. Everyone else's actions in the context of the new boss were incredibly contrived and wooden. The writers wanted the story to go a certain way, and they made reality bend around it to see it done. That was painful!
It's distracting to be so very aware of the writing.

I suppose, though, that it gets the important things done. Remember the important bits as Canon, and just throw out the garbage, eh? Good enough.",1236038400,,2121,4.781420765027322
3661179,1,B001JV5BHQ,"Bad, bad, BAD!!!  As other reviewers have written, I am a HUGE fan of the show, I have watched the series repeatedly on DVD, bought the sets for friends, purchased memorabilia, can quote lines, etc.  I have been tracking the progress of the movie on imdb and was so excited to see that the movie was actually coming out.  I received it in the mail today and couldn't wait to get home to watch it.

I should have watched Two and a Half Men reruns.

This is a terrible movie!  No Rube, a poor Daisy replacement (should have just killed her off if this was the best that was available), Treo's instead of Post-its, Mason and Roxy called it in, Delores was a delight with the oldest living cat, Murray, no Der Waffle Haus, and many other things that just should NOT have occurred.  I would rather have fond memories of the series than the stink that this movie has left.

Rube Sofer:  ""You're a constipator, Peanut.  You disturb my sh** and that's annoying.""",1236038400,3,954,4.431034482758621

It was weird seeing an older Reggie. I loved what they did with Reggie and Georgia's characters, what I always wanted to happen in the series.

I appreciate that they ended the series off with this movie. You've gotta see it if you were a fan, of course you'd probably do that anyway.",1235952000,,561,4.3428571428571425
3661181,1,B001JV5BHQ,"As a die-hard fan of the series, I have to say that this movie is an insult.

Despite being written by two of the original series' regular writers, both the writing and the direction (new director) are truly painful. Daisy Adair is played by a different actress, Sarah Wynter, who doesn't hold a candle to Laura Harris, who played Daisy in the series. Rather than being a superficial, but talented and clever, materially-driven woman, Daisy is now nothing more than an air-headed wanna-be. Her character has been utterly destroyed. Meanwhile, the character Roxie apparently has no problem breezing past lines she never would have even come close to consider crossing previously. The plot stretches credulity past the breaking point, and is entirely unimaginative.

The one point of strong satisfaction from the movie is that Georgia finally reveals herself to her sister Reggie. While very satisfying, it also feels like committing a cardinal sin, and in any case it was an easy, low-hanging fruit for the writers to grab that certainly didn't involve any skill to come up with.

On the whole, the movie was extremely painful for me to watch. If it had been any other movie, I would have simply stopped watching after 20, 30 minutes tops; but I needed closure. But it was so bad, that my wife has said she's considering writing her own ending to the series, just so she could forget this one.

Don't buy this movie, unless you're such a die-hard fan that you actually don't care if it completely sucks (think Star Wars Episode I, only a bit worse). It simply isn't worth it.",1235865600,182,1574,4.797047970479705

A small part of me died when I watched this poor excuse for a movie.  The writing, although catchy and witty at times, fails to live up to the extremely high expectations of the original series and the new Daisy attempts to imitate the mannerisms of the old Daisy, but fails to capture the simple elegance of Daisy, Daisy Adair.

The head reaper barely makes an appearance but still manages to show his complete lack of acting ability.  Neither the actor nor the writers attempted to give life to this obviously complex and interesting character.

And to top it off, the writers appear to have forgotten that movie is based off of a series.  There are far too many inconsistencies between the actual show and the movie based on the show.

3661188,2,B001JV5BHQ,"This straight-to-video movie of the ""hit"" show Dead Like Me does not quite capture the charm of the original series. Ellen Muth is back as George Lass, the girl who died from being hit with a toilet seat that fell from space at the age of 18. The original TV show is incredibly witty, charming, funny and poignant about life and death, while this new movie, fails largely due to the lack of Mandy Patinkin as Rube. This is a glaring problem for the shows quick-witted humor and warmth. He provided the proper father figure for George.

In place of Rube is Cameron (Henry Ian Cusack from Lost) who is a corporate form of the death dealer. Because Rube had ""found his lights"", Cameron steps in. Instead of post-its, they get blackberry's. So death has pushed the technological envelope. So be it. Others are back to reprise their roles like Mason (Callom Blue) and Roxie (Jasmine Guy). Daisy Adair who was played perfectly in the show by Laura Harris, was replaced by Sarah Wynter. Although she was fine, she did not have the same appeal. They should have just made her a new character.

This movie does not really seem to find its center, in either the characters or the story, and so its meandering around various dilemmas that do not add up to much. Its great to see Ellen Muth reprising her role as George, but even she cannot make this boat float too far without searching for another life boat.

The original show was cancelled after only 2 seasons, which is unfortunate as it was one of the better shows on TV at the time. It has a strong fan following which is why this movie exists, however, it is 5 years after the cancellation, so it seems really a muted point by now. The gesture is nice, but not necessary.

Ellen Muth was surprising in this show, yet, its unfortunate that she has not taken too many roles after the original show was cancelled. According to IMDB she has done some work, but nothing prominent or worthy of mention.

This movie is really for the fans. Its not to inspire new fans as the show is dead. If have not see the show, check that out instead!",1235692800,4,2077,4.455263157894737
3661189,4,B001JV5BHQ,"Except for Sarah Wynter's execrable take on Daisy, which broke the spell way too many times and prompted the loss of a star, this is a fine update on our band of Grim Reapers, one which I very much enjoyed. Taking place 5 years after our last contact with the group, you realize that life after death also moves on. And, as with the living, reapers can change...or stagnate.

While I missed Rube and Kiffany and Der Waffle Haus, Rube's disappearance was explained well enough and - let's face it - undead characters can't have the luxury of enjoying mortal attachments forever. Der Waffle Haus had become more than a quiet meeting place by the end of the 2nd season and I was beginning to be a bit uncomfortable with the continual stretching of the boundaries between living and dead there - it was almost Grand Central Reaper, what with gravelings fighting over Halloween candy two booths over, stubborn souls and reapers who used to work for Rube popping in and Kiffany appearing to take food orders during a heated discussion on soul-taking and supposedly never hearing a thing - and so I can certainly see the point of shaking up their working routine.

While I didn't like the new head reaper, as was intended, Henry played the part well and I didn't feel a disconnect, as I saw his take as very much in line with the feel of the Ray character in 2nd season. Plus, his character's actions and attitude served as a very effective backdrop to highlight the reapers' current personalities and foibles, and were necessary to facilitate the interaction between George and Reggie - something Rube would never have allowed.

Happy Time becomes simply a room in which the Delores/Millie relationship is staged and thus much less important, again in line with the growth in the characters.  Working at Happy Time is simply a part of George's 'life' after 5 years, not a new and strange thing to negotiate. Millie and Delores have become even closer over the years and Millie has become a trusted working associate as well as a surrogate daughter. That relationship is handled extremely well.

The real meat of this movie, and to me the most satisfying and moving aspect, is George's growing maturity and self-awareness of herself as a person with social - and cosmic - value and has learned that reaping must trump her personal feelings, as is so sadly exampled. The other reapers have changed and learned very little about themselves and life in the past five years, but George - ah, George.

George's interaction with Reggie shows a level of maturity and understanding that Joy Lass never exhibited in any episode. (Although Joy's character has, thankfully, gotten over herself and George's death and is no longer in the running for High B**ch of the Universe.) George understands and accepts her mission and value as a reaper now, and has integrated it into her life more successfully than the other reapers.  She and Reggie needed to reach out to each other to finally heal from the pain that George's death caused them both, so Rube's moving on and being replaced by a hands-off jerk could be seen as part of a bigger plan by Rube's boss.  I like to think so.

And what can I say about the ending, other than it was about as perfect as is possible in all the ways that are important. I'll definitely watch this one many more times.",1235692800,,3332,4.682051282051282

I mean why even have the character in the movie?  She had no real part.  It was just cringe worthy through out.

But most importantly, where was the whimsy?  There was just, just none.  There weren't many jokes, the ones there were weren't very good, it wasn't lighthearted.

But all criticism aside, the main story lines (the George ones) were satisfying, especially the George and Reggie one.

It wasn't a terrible film, and honestly I didn't think they would be able to recapture the old magic with 2 focal cast members gone, after several years had passed.  Not great but not bad.

Honestly I hope they make more so I can find out more about Reggie's life.  I found her really interesting in this installation.  Heck, I'd probably watch a show just about her.  It might not be supernatural, but she and interesting character.",1235692800,,1154,4.6716417910447765

one of the big problems i found with this movie is the new daisy. the new girl playing her wasn't really up to the task and either because of that or the other way around the writing for her was alot weaker. in the final seasons they really gave her some depth as a person and made her much more relatable. in the movie here they portray her as a general blonde bimbo airhead. which is disapointing.

you never really get closure as to what happened to rube. i imagine they just couldn't get the actor back but they could've wrote him out a little better.

final word: if your a hardcore fan you'll be disapointed but it's definitly worth watching to see what everyone is up to again, roxy, dolores and mason are still great supporting characters and george who is the main character does have some great things going on here. i'd say it's a rental not a purchase though.",1235606400,,1033,4.341968911917099

The interaction between George and Reggie was great (although there wasn't enough of it) and the addition of a boss that wasn't a fatherly figure, like Rube, was a brilliant stroke. No one could replace Mandy Patinkin as Rube and I'm glad they didn't try.

There are some production errors and some things that make you scratch your head and just go, ""Huh?"" (like the why didn't Roxy, in her police uniform, do ANYTHING after the guy choked in the salon? And why didn't anybody ask her, a cop, to help?).

But all in all, it's great to have the show back, great to see the interaction with George and Reggie, and great to have even the slightest glimmer of hope that we'll see more of this wonderful saga.

Most of the characters were there and familiar (I thought the Rube absence was well-played), the exception here was Daisy... When the show was around, I loved the character of Daisy - Laura Harris played the transparent confidence vailed vulnerability perfectly. She had this way of smiling and being charming, but conveying the real sadness through a glance or some other form of expression.  The new actress, Sarah Wynters, does a decent job but I just couldn't connect with the character again. And I really missed the connection.

As someone stated before, I would've been more than happy to wait until Laura Harris became available. MGM delayed the release of the movie so many times, it probably wouldn't have made that much of a difference to allow her schedule to open up.

One of my favorite things though, was the peace Joy seemed to find. We had watched her struggle so much during the series run to cope with George's death. To see her not only dealing, but helping other parents deal was a great way to sort of bring that character full circle.

The second storyline, the one with the other reapers and their new boss, was pretty lame. The actors were okay, but the story was a little thin. The new boss, Cameron, was apparently screwing up their reaps, but to what end? Did he want to spoil their stats? Was he the devil, impersonating a head reaper and just trying to create chaos? You never do find out.

I had one issue with casting. The replacement Daisy (Sarah Wynter) just didn't compare to the original (Laura Harris). In the series, Harris exuded a believable sadness underneath Daisy's peppy exterior, which Wynter just couldn't replicate or rather she didn't even try to.

In listening to the commentary by the director, I understand that he was trying to make the story understandable to people who hadn't watched the series. But frankly, they would've been better off if they'd played things entirely towards the fans of the show.",1235433600,,1137,4.703517587939698

I went into the experience with zero expectations.  You cannot recreate the original b/c you are missing key components (Rube/""Original"" Daisy).  Many reviewers are crying about them being gone...well the actors had other work, and have moved on.

Not to trounce on any of Laura Harris other past film work, but I think her role in Dead Like Me the series has been her finest work.

Also noticeably different, I don't think any other reviewer brought this up yet, but they picked a different actress to play George's alternate image of Millie. (You know what she'd look like in the mirror or on TV or basically to anyone else that wasn't a fellow Reaper.

Also this might be kind of small and minor, but in flashback to childhood Reggie's younger self had blonde hair in the movie. Reggie's hair was naturally brown. I am guessing shes bleached it since she's in high school now and stuff, but the movie is trying to make you think shes been blonde her whole life.

I know as we got to season 2 we saw less and less of Clancy Lass, George and Reggie's dad.  He was not in the movie at all, nor was he mentioned I don't think.

Anywho, I am probably being to anal about the small stuff.

3661236,5,B001JV5BHQ,"The Reapers are back!  ""Dead Like Me"" is much the same save that Rube (Mandy Patinkin) and Der Waffle Haus have both passed on.

Meet the new boss, different from the old boss.  Cameron Kane (Henry Ian Cusick) died in the towers at 9/11 and the former financial genius brings a new twist to the Reaper business.  For one, they're using cell phones to communicate now and getting their 'reaps' via text instead of post-it notes.  And their breakfast location is much more upscale.

Unfortunately, the team isn't quite as together as they used to be and they're all breaking the rules that Rube strictly enforced.  The consequences of these rule breakings are interesting and painful.

I've been looking forward to this movie for 2 years now and definitely glad to see it on.  Hopefully, the film will revive an interest in the series.

Maybe he'll show up in the next one. I was always more of a Rebecca Gayheart fan than a Daisy one, so I didn't miss the original Daisy too much. Ellen Muth was awesome as always- I have really missed her!!! And Reggie was finally a beautiful teenager. I know she had to be more grown up, but I missed her brattiness/animosity towards her mother. That was always a great part of the series. It was great overall though for the consumate fan.

3661238,2,B001JV5BHQ,"I was sooooooo excited when I heard they were making a Dead Like Me movie. I could hardly wait to see it. Then I spoke to a fellow Dead Like Me friend and he said the movie was wretched. I decided to watch it anyway thinking that perhaps since I had lowered expectations after hearing his opinion (which is usually spot on with the same tests) I was still devastated at the terrible quality of this movie.

First of all, Rube is gone. This is just wrong. Its like having oreos and no milk, popcorn without butter, the A-team without Mr. T. He was THE GUY and now he's gone. Another reviewer said that we should remember that he chose not to do it. Perhaps this is because the script was a bunch of drivel. His replacement, this uber-sleazy guy named Cameron just makes my skin crawl. Halleljuah he plays such a teeny part in the overall movie but his scenes just make you want to cringe. Second, they changed the actress who plays Daisy. Daisy is of course always obnoxious and self-absorbed but this actress is just plain awful. Daisy had her fleeting selfless moments on the show but this actress is super whiny and grates on your nerves the way she talks. And then there is Mason, who had his funny moments in the show and was always a little ""me, me, me"" but comic in relief in the show. They ruin that here too, Mason is a womanizing ridiculous idiot shadow of his former character and nothing he did was funny. He was mostly just annoying, which is too bad because he was my favorite in the series.

I have nothing great to say about this movie. All the characters including the regulars have changed, mostly for the worst and they seemed to have abandoned the entire Grim Reaping angle. It sits on a back burner for most of the movie and George's peformance borders on more of anguished than her usual spunk KMA attitude. What a shame. The show was wonderful but this is just crud.

3661240,5,B001JV5BHQ,"No, not you afficianaods of the late Jerry Garcia.  I mean the fans of ""Dead Like Me"", the cult favorite TV show that was itself reaped after only two seasons.  Be warned that this review contains some details required for a decent review that some readers may consider spoilers.

This movie picks up 3 years after the series ended, as the Reapers must adjust to major changes in their by-now well-patterned afterlives.  ""Der WaffelHaus"" has burned to the ground and their patriarch Rube has received his lights and departed.  His replacement, a Type-A maverick (Cameron) wastes no time in setting up a new order in the organization, beginning with handing out assignment via texting rather than Post-Its.  More of Rube's rules go by the wayside as he allows each of the Reapers to break discipline and follow their individual desires for wealth (Mason), fame (Daisy), success (Roxy), and closure (George) at the expense of their afterlife responsibilities.  When things begin to sour, however, they finally appreciate the validity of Rube's rules.

Some criticisms of this DVD are justified - the movie revives the show without really expanding upon it and the underlying mythology, but this is mostly because the movie attempts to simultaneously address too many topics that inevitably accompany a 3-year lapse.  Even so, the series' quirky gallows humor that first appealed to me is still there (the group's attempts to find a final solution to their problems with Cameron is hilarious), and Ellen Muth as George is still a treat to watch as she continues to sort out the afterlife of someone who is ""Dead Like Me"".",1235260800,,1618,4.985130111524164
3661241,3,B001JV5BHQ,"I agree with everyone I miss Rube but since this is a story of George being a grown up it's good that the father figure is gone.

The characters were really out of place, there were a few ""Daisy would never do that!!!"" and ""That's not Roxy!!!"" but I did enjoy the George storyline, it would have been nice without that stupid new boss, he was annoying and not really worth the screen time.
If you're curious I'd rent it first and not buy it. It could have been better but it's not. There are the blaring errors that are hard to miss, Really what happened to the cosmic dealie that made it to where the reapers can't tell stories to the living relatives that was made clear in season one?

For Brian, he has had Wonderfalls, Dead Like Me and Pushing Daisies.  All very bizarre concepts but wonderful results.  Probably masterpieces, yet eventually all canceled.  Pity television viewers for missing out on these shows.  Dead Like Me has two wonderful seasons on Showtime before it was axed.  The show was developing and deepening with its second season of course and then months later it was canceled.  The cast and crew were pretty stubborn and refused to give up on the show.  No other network would take it and still most came together to make this straight to DVD film.  There are definitely aspects of the show that are missing.  The special effects are less, even hair and make up suffered but still I admire the creators for trying to keep the show together.  The story in this film is nice and keeps the spirit of the show.  There is still something a bit leaden and not light enough to keep the idea alive.  Humor falls flat and the story is just not a great as the episodes have been.  Still Dead Like Me is watchable and well recommended if you are a fan of the show.  People who don't know the show may be better recommended to see an episode from the seasons.

What's bad?  Daisy.  The new actress playing Daisy just doesn't feel like Daisy.  At least there weren't many scenes with her.  Also the new boss is just annoying.  Not enough information about him really.

It was the best written tv series l have seen (even beats Buffy the Vampire Slayer) with thoughtful but humorous story lines in each episode.  l just loved the premise behind the stories. The movie could have been better, some of the problems were likely due to low budget, but it was wonderful to see most of the characters again (thus 5 stars).  Reggie (Britt McKillip) was the real star of the movie; she is a great young actress and provided the best performance of the movie.  The new boss (he did not reap anyone) and replacement Daisy did not fit in at all.  The storylines in the movie did not run well together, compared to the series, George's interactions with the other reapers was missing.  Unlike other reviewers' l think the ending, which was great, unfortunately was complete and means a return of the series is not going to happen (hope l am wrong).

3661247,1,B001JV5BHQ,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the original series.  I was so excited when I heard a movie was being released that I pre-ordered it and waited with great anticipation until it arrived in my mailbox.

As I watched Dead Like Me, the movie, all I kept thinking was... is this it?  I loved George and Dolores, but character-wise, that was it.  I agree with others' review's on the ""new"" Daisy.  She left a great deal to be desired, acting-wise and character-driven-wise.  The plot and story line seemed disjointed and areas that could/should have been flushed out and exciting/entertaining/illuminating were just flat, boring and seemed ""rushed"" or glossed over.

There is so much more the writers could have done with this movie, if only to convince someone/anyone to revive the series, but apparently they were only interested in getting a paycheck and doing the least amount of work in the process.  Or maybe the writers of this movie never actually ""watched"" the series.  In any case, I CAN NOT recommend this movie to ANYONE who loves the series.  It is a cheap attempt to make a buck and does nothing to be true to the series.

It is really a shame, because so much more could have been done by the writers and by the Daisy character.  Rube's replacement, Cameron, was interesting to a small degree, but not enough character development there either to justify his ending comments that he did what he did to create chaos and see where the ripples in the pond led when he made people do the wrong thing.  I mean, is he supposed to be a devil; truly evil?, or just simply misguided and ""quirky?"".

That being said, as usual, I loved Dolores Herbig and the whole idea of giving kitty one last Hurrah.  You could probably do a decent flick just on her character alone!

The three best parts of the flick for me were:
(1) when Mason throws ""another leg on the fire"".
(2) The ending shot when our fav character looks skyward and says... ""....""
(3) Skydiving with Murray. (That shot just killed me).

But that is not what the best parts of Dead Like Me, the movie should have been.  Shame on the writers, producers, directors and marketers of this bomb!  This could have been another ""SERENITY"", but instead it was just a ""SNORITY"".

By all means, we need to revive the series.... but by all means, too, stop making trash movies to sequel great series'.

If you LOVE the SERIES... Do NOT waste your money on this garbage.  Wait til they revive the series, or at least make a better movie.  Only, not with the same people that wrote this film!  And maybe with an actress who can be true to the Daisy character that we all know and love! And let's get Mason back to his roots!

3661251,1,B001JV5BHQ,"This movie disappointed me because the makers had so much to work with and they did nothing with it.  As another reviewer pointed out, the writers were lazy.  The opening monologue was word-for-word the same monologue George gives in the second episode of the show.  Since anyone who is watching the movie has seen the show before, they should have found a new way to present the backstory.  Also, instead of just finding a clever way to write Daisy off, they had an awful actress revive her role.  Instead of being frail and subtle like the old Daisy, she was a crazy, bossy brute.  It made no sense.  Which brings me to the story line.  Without giving anything away, let me just say that the reapers break a few of Rube's old rules in his absence.  What ensues does not follow any of the old logic that was laid out in the show.  The story unfolds in such a choppy, incohesive way that by the end it is hard to tell what the characters have learned and what will be their fates.  Instead of providing closure to the show, it just made it messier.  It was no Serenity, if you know what I mean.",1235088000,,1094,4.3088235294117645

This one's just not quite up to it....  The new Daisy doesn't excite me at all, and Mandy Patinkin's ""Rube"" was almost worth the price of admission by itself.  Some things in the movie are alluded to, and seem to happen without further explanation, things which Rube counseled his staff about....  If you don't know the ""story"", you'll miss 'em.

Ellen and her ""mother"" and ""sister"" are still at their very best, and ""Reggie"" (can't remember her name) has really grown up beautifully.  The ""older"" ""Millie"" is no longer a mouse, either....  (The rest of the ""old"" cast seem to be as good as ever.)

Overall, maybe it's just because I've seen the original several times, but I don't care for too many of the changes....  Still, if you liked the series, and don't mind the changes being a little grating, why not?

3661254,3,B001JV5BHQ,"This is not the Dead Like Me movie fans have been waiting for. It does adequately tie up some loose ends, but that's it. Hack director Stephen Herek abandons the unique look, feel and palette of the series for something much more pedestrian. Why? It just doesn't make sense. They needed to be back in Der Waffle House too. Under use of gravelings as well.

I understand that Patinkin's Rube character is absent, and that's okay. I think they should have gone that way with the Daisy character as well because the replacement (Sarah Wynter) they cast has absolutely no charm, depth or even the delicate sensibilities of the would be starlet Laura Harris originated. She has no chemistry with Mason either. Her scenes in this film are tolerable, but distract from the scenes with Jasmine Guy, Callum Blue, Ellen Muth and Christine Willes who did return in their original forms. It is immediately clear that the director doesn't quite grasp the motivations or value of the ensemble cast. He barely scratches the surface with each. They just seem bored. I also missed Crystal lurking in the background. She's peeks her head into one shot, but that's about it.

The charm and mystique are absent from this version of Dead Like Me. I'm glad to have seen it as a fan, but this movie should not be introduced to anyone who hasn't seen the series. They won't enjoy it or understand why the series had a following in the first place.

There must have been different producers or something, because they tried to make the movie a drama rather than a comedy. This movie lost ALL of Dead Like Me's quirkiness and humor. George Lass basically had no personality in this movie -any personality she did have was REALLY boring - none of those funny narrated side-thoughts she always had in the series. Mason wasn't an alcoholic or a hobo - which made him really BLAH, Roxy wasn't intimidating, Joy had a creepy happiness the entire movie, the actress who played Daisy got her characteristics ALL WRONG, so don't get this movie if you want to keep your good memories of Dead Like Me. The only highlight of the movie was watching Dolores Herbig carry around her cat in a fanny pack at Happy Time. Maybe Dolores should have her own spin-off series.",1235001600,4,900,4.4939024390243905
3661256,4,B001JV5BHQ,"I've been anxiously awaiting this release ever since the rumors started circulating about it being made.  On one hand, the wait has made the delivery even sweeter.  On the other, I've had time to really think about what I hoped it would be like.

Overall, it's a pretty good effort at delivering that dark humor that was so key to the series.  While I missed Rube dearly, particularly his relationship with George, we all knew that he'd fill his quota sooner or later.  Some of the characters have truly retained their cherished quirkiness - particularly Dolores Herbig.  Roxy, too, managed to keep most of her tough-as-nails appeal.  It was nice to see George as a woman now, acting on motives that would have been totally at odds with her as an 18-year old.  I think that the character that showed the most growth was, amazingly, Joy Lass.  It always seemed that, in the series, every time she made a breakthrough in her relationship with Reggie (who's grown up nicely, although she seems to have lost most of her rebellious bite) it was undone in the next episode.  Here, we actually see how a maturing daughter and her mother are able to develop together.

However, there are some fairly major issues as well.

First up, Daisy.  I found Ms Wynter's performance to be not even a pale imitation of Laura Harris (I must note that originally I detested Daisy, as she took the place of my beloved Betty.  In the later episodes, I grew to love her as the character developed and deepened).  Ms Harris portrayed Daisy as fragile, unsure, and truly generous under her self-absorbed and blithe exterior.  The breeziness and casual confidence is gone, replaced by an awkward and forced attempt at simply being a boozing tart.

Second, Mason has been turned into a clown.  While he always provided much of the comic relief in the series, his presence here has been whittled down until he's become just another junkie gigolo.  In no way do I mean that Callum Blue did not do a good job here, merely that he did the best he could with what he was given.  Mason's childlike charm, generosity, and protectiveness are almost all gone.  While it appears he still moons over Daisy, the chemistry is totally gone (again, I think this is unfortunately due to the way that Daisy has been portrayed here).

Cameron?  I honestly thought going into this that I'd have more of a problem with the ""new Rube"".  As it turns out, he really doesn't figure into the equation too much.  He's there, but there's no real depth or reason to him.

My main problem is with the violation of one of the fundamental reaper-universe rules.  Remember when George tried to talk to her mother, and even though she had it all planned out the memories started slipping away from her?  That's not a problem anymore, apparently - which really makes this movie almost unnecessary.

This movie takes a dangerous approach to a show whos fans can only be described as rabid.  It gives us the actions and occurrences, but not the reasons.  DLM fans are a clever bunch, and may be left starving for some real closure.",1235001600,,3067,4.644981412639405
3661257,2,B001JV5BHQ,"This movie was pretty weak over all.
The big problem for me was (aside from the absence of Rube and the real Daisy) that there were two competing story lines, but there wasn't enough run time in the movie to really flesh either one out fully.
It felt like watching a ""Cliff Notes"" version of what a DLM movie should be.

It was nice to see the remaining cast again, but if this was intended as a series farewell, they failed completely. And if it was intended as a hook to bring the series back I'm afraid it's far too weak a movie to do that either.

If you buy it do so as a completion of the series. Don't do it if you expect huge entertainment value from it.",1235001600,4,662,4.084615384615384

Short Summary: There is a new boss in town and the reapers have to follow his commands. Only to find out that the new boss schedules the reapings too close together and gives Daisy more than one reap. The new boss definetly isn't Rube and he doesn't care about the reapers like Rube did. The gang rebels and doesn't do the reapings like they are suppose to and it leads George to tell her sister that she is a reaper. I would have to say that George telling Reggie that she is a grim reaper and hanging out with Reggie a little bit is the BEST part of the entire movie. Watch the movie to see if the grim reapers can get rid of their new boss and get back into action...

I do not even own a Television. I saw this program on my friends tv after hearing about it from a radio personality. I paid for my friends subscription to the network this show was featured on so I could watch this show. I purchased the dvd's of both seasons of the show. I purchased this dvd, even though I knew there were 600 feeds of the pirated version of this dvd on the net.
That said I am a fan of this show. I think this show was the best show/series on television bar none.
I hope this series is revived. I was disappointed that this show was canceled.
Ellen Muth/Georgia Lass and the cast of this show are all excellent professionals and they deserve to have the chance to keep the show alive.

Long Live, Dead Like Me.

MGM stated they would restart the series if the sales were good, maybe it shouldn't.  Would really like to remember ""Dead Like Me"" from the two seasons rather than the film.  I gave this movie 2 stars because it just didn't match up to the series.  I would have hoped that it would be an extension to the series, but wasn't excited about how it turned out.

the same people were going to be in it. I pre-ordered immediately, I couldn't wait!! My family loved this show so this was like a gift!

A gift that was horribly wrong and should never have been made. If this
had been a pilot episode, I would never have watched it again. The writing was terrible, it lacked something great that the series had. Rube
being gone and a different woman playing Daisy made it even more wrong.
The woman playing Daisy in this couldn't have been more out of place,
she wasn't pretty, her acting was terrible, she gave no life to Daisy
and she seemed more than a bit crazy most of the time. The old Daisy was definitely a narcissist but she had an endearing sadness about her that made her vulnerable. This actress had nothing to make you even like the character. The new ""group leader"" was about a subtle as a slap in the face. **SPOILER** The sex scene with him and Daisy that George walked in on was way over the top, you know that Daisy would never do something like that with the boss.

George was still the same, great, as was Dolores Herbig. Mason, while
still the same actor, seemed to just be going through the motions for
the pay check. Same with Roxy. She would never have fallen for the spell
of the new boss and broken the rules. That just wasn't her at all.

All in all, it was a waste of money. If they make any more of these I
won't be buying them. I know the whole story line was to show what would
happen if Reapers didn't follow the rules, all would become chaos and it
was a good idea. Somewhere along the line, though, it all fell short. I
guess the producers could take a que, the show ended on a good note,
don't try and resurrect what's dead. You may not like the way it comes
back. I couldn't have been more disappointed with this movie.",1234915200,22,1861,4.207282913165266

First off the new Daisy was a waste they should have just left her out and maybe brought a new character.
Second it wasn't the same without Rube. He really made the show. Mason was funny as always and I liked Roxy, but George was not the same George from the show. This was very boring you couldn't get into it and I kinda just wanted it to end. Anyone who is a true Dead Like Me fan will be upset at this horrible movie.
Dolores was not her usual self which sucked cause she was funny. I also wish that they didn't get  rid of Der Waffle Haus cause that was just the center of the whole show. The should have just left the show how it ended....sometimes (like in this case) things just should have been left unsaid.",1234915200,2,842,4.066265060240964
3661283,2,B001JV5BHQ,"As a big fan of the show Dead Like Me, I was really looking forward to the DVD movie, though knowing that Rube wasn't in it and that Daisy had been replaced, I had my doubts.  It looks like that was with good cause.

The scenes involving George, her family, and Delores were great and felt like they were a good continuation of the characters and story from the series.  She seems to be fairly at peace and in tune with her after-life as a reaper and as an employee (assistant manager?) at Happy Time.

Unfortunately, the scenes with the other reapers are terrible.  The new Daisy has all of the annoying traits Daisy showed when she first came on the series with none of the charm or growth the character had as the series progressed.  Mason felt like a badly-written cartoon character, and save for one moment where he seemed to care for Daisy, it felt like none of the progression with those two from the series towards each other had ever happened.  And even Roxy quickly turns from being a tough no-nonsense cop to a goofy opportunist with no real reason why.

Then we have Cameron Kane, the new head of the reapers played by Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond from Lost).  Suddenly, this wealthy playboy is in charge of all of the reapers as Rube apparently moved on to the next life.  Cameron tells the reapers that he was put in charge due to his great track record, but then immediately starts dropping the ball on the reaping assignments.  There is some initial suspicion from the reapers about this, but that is basically dropped when they start believing they can use their own powers for personal gain.

When this eventually turns on them, they turn on Cameron and kill him - or at least dismember and burn him to ash as you can't kill a reaper.  WHAAAA?!  That's right:  A) They never get back to the suspicious way that Cameron somehow took over the organization and B) They violently ""deal"" with him not because of that or his mismanagement, but because they are unhappy about how they've been treated personally by him.

Seriously, this movie would have been better had they just cut out the other reapers alltogether, as badly as they were used.

3661284,5,B001JV5BHQ,"Rube has done his last reap and there is a new boss in town.  The first thing I thought when they said Rube was gone was ""Oh man, this is never going to work"".  But it does, the new guy has a philosophy that you can take advantage of being a reaper and who cares about the consequences.  Like the regular show, there are several complex plot lines that the writers did a great job pulling together.

Plot line 1, 5 years have passed and Reggie (George's little sister) is in high school having a secret romance with a popular football player whom George has to later Reap.

Plot line 2, the new boss has seduced the rest of the Reapers and got them to bend the rules, smart phones and texts have replaced post its under the new guy and with everybody breaking of the rules, George reconnects with Reggie and the Reapers break out of their spell.

Overall, I was very pleased and the end closed very well.  Loose ends were tied and openings were left in case (hopefully), that there is another movie or the series goes on.

After all, Dead Like Me is some of my favorite television of all time with a sudden ending and unresolved plot lines -- there was no way the movie could live up to it or provide any closure.

The movie did not live up to the show. It did not provide any storyline closure. It did however, provide some character closure. George returns, as do Roxy, Mason, and Daisy (though Daisy is played by someone else). Gone is Rube and Der Waffle Haus, and the movie suffers because of it.

Most TV shows turned into feature films suffer because of an extended plot line. After watching hours of bite-sized episodes, a movie just feels too long. Dead Like Me: Life After Death doesn't suffer from this problem, luckily. The length and plot feels organic, like a natural extension of the show.

Overall, the movie could have been done better. However, it could have been done far, far worse. If you enjoyed Dead Like Me the television show, then check out the movie. If you haven't seen the show, start there and work your way up to the movie.",1234828800,,1167,4.521327014218009

I doesn't really tie up any loose ends, except for Rube, and it gives fans something they wanted back in season 2; George and Reggie to meet again.

After watching the special feature ""Resurrecting Dead Like Me,"" I understood more of what they were hoping to achieve (and they thought they succeeded).  I appreciated the movie more.  I don't quite get the whole comic book look, but whatever.

I don't think I would've been able to justify the $20 I almost spent on this, but I don't mind the $5 in rental fees (though I might get it used down the road sometime).

It was a nice look at what would happen if you broke the rules and we got to see George all grown up, but there was just something missing (other than the real Daisy Addair and Kiffany - though I guess the opening scene explains Kiffany - and Rube is explained well).  I don't know.  I was just left feeling slightly unsatisfied but TOTALLY READY TO GO BACK AND WATCH SEASONS ONE AND TWO ALL OVER AGAIN!

Most of all, I was thrilled to see Ellen Muth again - she's awesome. George is such a complex character. Delores' storyline literally made me weep at one point.

While she was very sexual in the series, her conquests were always merely conversed about and not actually shown.

Once the film ended the only words we could think was ""WHY did that need to be made.""

I absolutely love the show. One of my top ten.

Why this movie fails:
-Loss of Rube. No characters seemed to even care that he was gone.
-Loss of Daisy and replaced by someone doing a bad impression of her.
-Dry boring script.
-Emotionless dialogue being delivered by cast.
- Different locations trying to be passed off as the originals.
- Threw out old reaping rules and stomped all over what was set up.
- 25 person cat funeral.
- Different cinematography didn't match old aesthetic.
- Wasn't made for fans, new comers won't enjoy.

Just bottom of the barrel production. I don't know why there are so many gleaming reviews. I think once more true fans see this wreck of a great show, the true ratings will come out.

3661309,2,B001JV5BHQ,"Great series... really really bad movie.
Here's the rundown on what they did to muck this up:

-Softened mom character to unrecognizable state
-Tried to make George more mature, which is fine, but they also made her  a really really boring, dark un-funny, brooding, character -make up for Muth, not so good in most places,  the years are showing on her whereas I didn't notice it as much with everyone else, reapers aren't suppose to age and there were spots where she looked great, so it tells me there was production value at work...Millie identity is a lot cuter in the movie, works for me.
- I never cared for the Daisy Adair character in the series but they did give you a little depth to chew on as it pertains to the character, which let you know that she wasn't a one dimensional character-- all of that gone here... yuck, they would have done better to leave her out, since the original Daisy didn't return because she is a truly horrible character that adds no value at all...
- Roxy and Mason have not grown or matured a bit, which is why I'm confused about the George character changing... that said they really had no role here but for yuck yucks, which weren't that funny to begin with...
- Reg has grown into a nice young lady, unfortunately she's in the middle of the most non-sensical plot ever conceived(ok, ever is a little strong...but close)
- Dolores 'Big Brown Eyes' and Murry the dialysis cat are back and provides a glimmer of the old show
- No Rube - impossible to replace, but what they came up with is in a word ridiculous, not to mention that they open up so many plot holes without closing them it's not even funny - breaking established rules laid down throughout the series to further their ridiculous-ness, not even addressing questions left open with the series-- my goodness, isn't it a given that most people watching this have seen the series, we're not idiots.

I think the main problem here was writing... really really crap writing and direction,  I'm not sure if the execs got hold of it or what -- they never should have made a movie that they couldn't deliver something half way decent on-- I really don't see how you could screw this up, the foundation had been laid and there's no doubt now why Mandy Patinkin and the Daisy character passed on it...in the end, that's why it became straight to video and the release was pushed back for over a year.

What you're left with is supreme crappiness -- ah well, we have the show, don't count on it returning on the strength of this movie, which is too bad... I really miss the show.",1234396800,6,2571,4.482905982905983

Don't do it. Not only should you not buy Life After Death, you should not ever see it.  Don't Netflix it, don't borrow it from a friend, don't Bit Torrent it, or even watch it when it eventually appears on cable.  It is so bad it can darken your recollection of the original series.  Banish Life After Death from your mind and pretend it doesn't exist, the way Godfather III or Aliens 3 don't exist.

How is it awful? Let me count the ways. It was not the producers' fault that Mandy Patinkin and Laura Harris weren't available, but their absence leaves a gaping hole their replacements can't begin to fill. The continuing actors (yes, I'm afraid even Ms. Muth) sleepwalk through their performances.  The dialog is dull and plotting slow, sappily sentimental and illogical.  The screenwriters were too lazy or unimaginative to follow the cosmological rules reaping that made the series so clever. And so on.

Everyone seems to have their favorite character, and it seems many are angered when they aren't around.  For me, it was George, she made the show.  The first scene of the series I had ever seen was of her sitting at the counter in the Waffle House and pulling a fork out of her chest.  Her line was unexpected, but said with such a believable honesty.  I was hooked.

I agree with most, that the new Daisy was even worse than the original - if that's possible.  I preferred Betty myself, as Rebecca Gayheart played her well and the character seemed a better 'fit' for the show.

If you're the sort that thinks people acting like morons is comedy, then this form of intelligent humor might not be your thing.  It's funny, while still having depth.  It touches the heart, while still being a bit dark.  I loved it, so sue me.

Without any spoilers and with the understanding that everyone has a different taste in movies, I can share with you a few of our concerns:

With the exception of one or two, most of the characters did not act at all like their original TV counterparts, leading to much frustration for viewers.

The lack of some actors leaves the audience with a hole; feeling like ""of course they will have ... before the end of the movie!"", expecting but the movie never delivers.

Some ground rules we've all come to understand from the TV show were blatantly broken with no excuse, explanation or even attempt at reasoning.

And finally, none of the great story opportunities/unfinished plot lines from the show were even touched. This movie was an opportunity for so many answers, but none were given.

In the end the Dead Like Me movie was an extreme disappointment to those who loved the show. With nearly every aspect of the movie having deviated from what the show consisted of, and the poor, predictable plot, the fans didn't even get the enjoyment we all eagerly anticipated.",1233705600,23,1199,4.632075471698113

I don't begrudge keeping these actors gainfully employed, but ... to echo the sentiments of another reviewer here ... ""the magic's GONE.""

3661358,2,B001JV5BHQ,"I have to disagree with a lot of what people seem to be saying in their reviews. As a long time fan of the series, I actually found this to be fairly disappointing. I did not think the consistency of the characters was there throughout, and the storyline often seemed poorly tied together. Sometimes it seemed like they couldn't decide between making a movie for the  fans and making a movie for the casual viewer who didn't know all the backstory.

Laura Harris is sorely missed. Couldn't they have waited until the timing worked out with her? Her replacement is trying very hard to measure up, but she doesn't quite cut it. I never felt like she had a full grasp on Daisy's character at all. Situations that Laura could have given meaning to came out stiff and one-dimensional.

Rube was also missed. At least they gave a valid reason for his absence.

As I said somewhere else: it's been too long and the magic is gone. Something was missing.

About the only character I felt was utterly perfect and herself 100% of the time was Dolores. And Murray. God bless you Murray Herbig.",1233532800,143,1081,4.551546391752577

It didn't really stand out as a feature film. It felt like one more last episode in the series, and I would've enjoyed it more if the real Daisy and Rube were still in. The other Daisy seemed out of place to me, and was more irritating than the original, if that is possible.

Other than that, the characters are still the ones we know and love.
And Dolores Herbig was very good in this one, as usual.

(Possible very minor Spoiler)
This movie does answer some of the questions on what would happen if the Reapers did break the rules, which was a nice peek into that, but I won't go much deeper.
(end)

I love the movie, But I was already a huge fan of the show. People without a background in the series may not appreciate this fully. If you are about to watch the movie first, Watch the series first (Netflix is awesome for this)

Overall, It's a nice trip down memory lane for an old fan. Seeing Reggie all grown up is weird, but cool.

PLEASE BRING BACK THE SHOW!!!!!!! It's seriously one of the best of all time.

Thanks for your time,

If you liked the show, the movie was done with the same type of humor, and the storyline was consistant with how the characters would have acted in the same situations.

The show handled the loss of Rube (mandy pankin) very well, and did it in such a way as to make it look flawless. The show keeps its edge.

There were a couple of moments where I said something like ""I thought reggie knew..."" but this is supposedly 5 years past george's death, and lets face it. Life goes on.

Personally, I thought the last line of the entire movie was the best ever! It was just the perfect line, for the perfect moment and fit the characters sooo well

(I've really tried hard not to include spoilers here, which is why this seems so disjoined with words like ""the character"" instead of character names)

This is a must have to go with season 1 and 2!!!",1233100800,39,889,4.325301204819277

8313811,4,B001JV5BHQ,"Loved the series. Have both years. Got spoiled with the relative slow action of a series so the movie, to me, seemed to try to jam too much into an hour and a half. Like they had too many loose ends to tie up all at once. Absolutely missed Rube and the new boss was totally unsympathetic, which I guess was the idea. All in all an enjoyable experience.

8313813,3,B001JV5BHQ,"The cleverness and much of the darkness of the original series was lost, and this became just a stock TV movie about redemption and closure. Frankly, it seems kinda like fan fiction from someone who loved the characters but didn't really understand what made the show work.

For $2.99 rental it was not a bad way to spend 90 minutes, but I can't recommend it to fans of the show.",1519689600,,379,4.414285714285715
