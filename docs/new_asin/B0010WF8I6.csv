3052666,5,B0010WF8I6,"It's a beautiful tour of Italy, almost like a bird flying hovering above as you view the magnificent scenery. Much better than being on the ground, with lovely music in the background to make you feel light as air.",1384819200,,214,4.512820512820513
3052667,5,B0010WF8I6,"A beautiful piece of literature.  A must read for anyone going to my ""second home"". Beautiful pictural!  Proud to be an Italian-American!",1359849600,,137,5.181818181818182
3052668,5,B0010WF8I6,"A great way to see the boot from a moving perch.  Difficult to improve the view, but the description could be appreciated more, perhaps, with a soprano voice,",1352592000,,158,4.642857142857143
3052669,1,B0010WF8I6,"As soon as I got this dvd home, I was so disappointed. It is basically a helicopter tour of italy. There are soooo very, very many other tourist/educational videos of Italy out there of quality that I feel you should spend your hard-earned money on another video. Honestly, I rarely give negative reviews and I am a very honest and open person. I really am not steering you in the wrong direction. There is a note of positivity in all of this, however, and that is to check out other websites (or maybe Amazon.com does in fact carry it) for the earlier published version of this dvd. I viewed the one dvd version of this item that was produced RIGHT BEFORE this one. That PRIOR published version of this DVD was excellent- not aerial at all!!! I know that the actual makers of this dvd have their own website as I checked it out myself. I suggest connecting with them and seeing if you could purchase the earlier published version through them, OR, go to your local public library and see there if they carry the earlier version. Again, if you can't get the version published before this one, sadly, DON'T BOTHER PURCHASING- you will definitely regret the purchase.  Who wants helicopter when you can be guided on foot and see sites and hear narrations up close and personal? With a helicopter motor in your ear, how can you fully absorb breathtaking Italy--what were the creators of this video thinking??!! By making the dvd aerial, it definitely cheapens the whole experience. The folks responsible for this dvd need to go back to the drawing board and stay there awhile- the whole video needs to be scrapped and re-done!! Poor, Poor, Poor.",1300233600,7,1642,4.642611683848798
3052670,5,B0010WF8I6,"An unusual video of Italy. It was done by aerial photography instead of at ground level. Seeing Italy from above was most unusual and beautiful. The background music was soothing, and the female narrator had pleasing voice, and was very informative.",1275177600,4,249,5.097560975609756
3052671,5,B0010WF8I6,The series of Visions is unbelievably beautiful and interesting.  I would recommend all of them for viewing.

3052675,2,B0010WF8I6,"It is not High Definition.  so though the content is beautiful... .shown on a 95"" screen ... doesn't look great.  We had to watch it on the 60"" so it wouldn't look as grainy.  Even there ... it wasn't super clear.",1492300800,2,213,4.146341463414634
3052676,1,B0010WF8I6,The quality of the DVD is unsatisfactory. It's grainy and blurry and the sound is distorted.,1491955200,,92,4.8125
3052677,5,B0010WF8I6,"Wonderful video, you will love the scenes from southern, northern, and western Italy.  So positively beautiful, including the narrator and the background music.

3052683,2,B0010WF8I6,"The quality of the DVD clarity is not good.  It is excessively grainy.  I assumed that it would be of the same quality as the PBS series on Television, which was shot in HD.  This disc is not at all of the same clarity as the broadcast series by PBS.  It reminded me of the quality of a bootlegged disc from an original copy.",1480723200,5,325,4.03125

Do not be fooled...It is NOT in HD, and it looks terrible on my HD TV.  Do Not Buy this!  I saw the same show on PBS and was amazed at the Hi Def resolution of the broadcast during a pledge drive, and they were using this DVD as a pledge gift, so I was happy to see it at Amazon where I could purchase it.  But this did not play back anywhere as good as it was on TV.  We played it on both a HD computer monitor and an HD plasma TV because we couldn't believe how bad it looked and thought we must be trying to watch it on the wrong screen since everyone else who reviews this says it looks good.
