8703274,4,B00TXSC9KY,"This is a great DVD for fans of Sharon Corr. The only trouble is in the cinematography, which I feel is a little bit limited. The set list and performance though however is just as you'd expect, and Sharon delivers a beautiful and heartfelt performance to her dedicated and renowned Brazilian fan base. The mini documentary / interview that is also included with this DVD is an added bonus that you will not find anywhere else online. If the price is right, and you're a fan don't hesitate - just buy it :)",1504656000,,506,4.451612903225806
8703275,2,B00TXSC9KY,"The music and Sharon's overall performance is wonderful, as expected. However, the video production quality of this concert is surprisingly amateurish, especially considering the talent of Sharon Corr and the great production of so many of The Corrs concert DVD's. There is a repeated camera shot from a stationary point at the back center of the theater that is inexplicably panned so far back that it captures high above the stage lighting area and makes you feel very disconnected from the performance. Great music and performance, but almost frustrating to watch unless it's just on in the background while you're cooking or something.",1480377600,,639,5.213592233009709
8703276,5,B00TXSC9KY,"Sharon Corr is an artist on her own, she particularly has done much more as part of The Corrs, but her two albums stand on her own. I highly recommend this concert if you're into her music. Or if you remember the Corrs, this is a bonus.",1439769600,,236,4.042553191489362
