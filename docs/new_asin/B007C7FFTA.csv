8514309,5,B007C7FFTA,"I watched three John Neumeier's ballets in succession, and this one had the deepest impact on me. I am not a big fan of ""story"" ballets (at least have not been until now) and prefer more abstract dance with  a story being just a whiff more than a title, just a hint in which direction to build your perception and imagination. This ballet convinced me that, not unlike opera, ballet could be a synthesis of more than music and movement. Mann's Der Tod in Venedig is a very profound and personal story. This ballet is inspired by the story and speaks of love, death, art, perfection, etc--the themes of the novella--in a powerful, emotionally and visually stunning language. Neumeier is an amazingly talented and creative choreographer, perhaps a genius. The dancers have no technical limitations; they can do absolutely unbelievable movements. Their acting is also very good and expressive.

I highly recommend to watch a conversation with Neumeier, included as an extra.",1438905600,2,971,4.987654320987654
