8448620,5,B004YMY1VO,"I have the VHS tape recording of this fantastic program. I was vacationing in Oah'u at the time it was aired on the PBS Hawai'i station. I was memorized by the story as it unfolded and the far reaching implications and impacts on both the native/spiritual Hawaiian culture, as well as the scientific & astronomical community's quest for learning more about the Universe in which each lives.

I cannot over-stress the impact that this program made upon me; in particular the native Hawaiian kahuna chanting and the celebration of Life that occurs on Mauna Kea. Not to be missed!

Thank you so very much, Ed McNulty!",1497139200,,614,4.783018867924528
