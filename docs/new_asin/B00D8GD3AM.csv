8590572,5,B00D8GD3AM,"I very much liked the first season of this show, and liked the idea of a 22 minute running time. I remember as a child a lot of the TV shows were about a half hour and had great drama. The creators of this show have brought back that glorious idea in a big way. I'm tired of all the half hour comedy sitcoms and love the fact that someone has rekindled the idea of an action drama series like SH:OS:EN. I'm very much looking forward to owning the second season of this outstanding series when it becomes available on DVD. I hope there's many seasons to come Thanks Again and good luck...",1396569600,,587,4.20353982300885
8590573,3,B00D8GD3AM,"The premise is basic. A criminal defense attorney finds a mysterious box on his doorstep. Inside is a picture and a gun. Soon he learns that he has been chosen to participate in a deadly game where he must kill the man in the picture before the deadline or be killed himself. If he refuses, his daughter and soon to be ex wife will be harmed.

Positives - Milo Ventimiglia is fantastic in his role as the defense attorney and the other actors play their parts well. The awkward silences, stilted conversation and reactions by the actors is believable to the situation they've been thrust into. The scene where Milo's character learns how to load a gun by looking it up on YouTube is priceless.

Negatives - The series is driven by the mental aspect more than the action so don't expect too many action sequences. There are certain parts that require the viewer to suspend a great deal of reality to make them believable.

In conclusion - Had I known in advance when I rented this movie that it was actually an online series and not a movie, I might have gone into it with a different mind set. As a movie it is slow moving, lacks background information and does not come to a satisfying conclusion. As a series I will reserve judgement until there is a conclusion but can say that the acting is fantastic and the emotional response to the situations are on point for the characters these people are portraying. If you like series that make you think ""What would you do in this situation"" this is an excellent choice for you. If however you are looking for the typical David vs. Goliath the good guy saves the day, I would not recommend it.",1375660800,2,1639,4.474916387959866
