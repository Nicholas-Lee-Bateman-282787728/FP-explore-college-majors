8289213,5,B000V9QYEG,"This is a great DVD that showcases Al at his most adventurous. Be sure to buy the version of this you can get for under 20 bucks and not the identical but somehow ""valuable"" version that the nutty e-shop seller has arbitrarily put a 140 dollar price tag on.",1247616000,,257,4.26530612244898
8289214,4,B000V9QYEG,"This is a very,very well done set of music. Being a guitarist for more years than I will admit to in public,a chance to study Mr.diMeola's work in a clean and very clear front row seat is more than worth it. The music and the musicians in this DVD are first class. However,my only beef with this ,is that the DVD is only about 50% electric,and 50% with acoustic! Having followed Al for many years,he has done many acoustic VHS and DVDs. I wanted to see him back on his Les Paul,or his custom made Paul Reed Smith,or his double neck PRS,etc. Having said all that,this Volcano DVD is still well worth it,for Al is first class , steel or nylon.",1196726400,,641,4.305785123966942
