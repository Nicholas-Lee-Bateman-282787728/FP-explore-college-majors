7795519,1,096954328X,"This is a movie about vampires and dentistry, but without any dental tools appearing in the movie. That is worked in as a joke, but like other ""jokes"" in the movie, it doesn't work. So the viewer is left with a low-budget vampire movie. There are some ideas established that are supposed to pay off in the sequel, but it appears the sequel never materialized.

If you have seen any of John Johnson's horror comedies, the budget and production is similar. But Johnson goes over-the-top zany, while ""Vampire Dentist"" stays inside the lines, to its detriment. This is not a bad idea for a movie, but it needed to look and feel a lot more polished.",1456185600,,644,4.551724137931035
