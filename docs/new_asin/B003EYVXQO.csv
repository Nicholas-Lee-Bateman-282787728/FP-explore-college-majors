4116069,5,B003EYVXQO,"I saw this movie last night, and it was wonderful, there were so many aspects of the human conditon, and how our way brought into this world shapes us to become who we are as we grow and take the road to the journey of life. It has the most amazing actors and actresses, and I really did enjoy it, It brought out all my emotions,and it was a nice change of pace from all the movies that have come out as of late, hope this helps some of you to go see the movie, It is a must see.",1289001600,,479,3.8
4116070,5,B003EYVXQO,"""Mother and Child"" is an amazing film. Yes, it is fairly somber, but it so well written and the characters all have a fresh humanity to them. They are not cookie cutter archetypes-they are fully realized woman all dealing with some level of emotional pain and try their best to cope. All of the performances are exceptional. The featured actresses are some of industry's best talent and deliver heartbreaking and nuanced performances.

However, this film belongs to Annette Bening and I hope she is remembered come Oscar time. She delivers the best performance of her career in my opinion. Annette's character undergoes a radical emotional transformation and you watch every painful and conflicted moment of it. Annette changes the timbre and cadence of her voice to portray the wounded Karen. She carries her body differently and completely embodies the character. I was riveted. She broke my heart and I hope she gets an Oscar for this. Sometimes voters do remember small films (i.e. Jessica Lange in Blue Sky)

However, I HATE the cover art for the DVD. It makes the film look like some feel-good romance and it is far from that. It is a searing emotional journey of several complex female characters on very different paths that converge.

The film is a must see.",1288656000,2,1267,4.883720930232558
4116071,5,B003EYVXQO,"i'm not usually drawn to tear-driven movies...but this one is quite an exception.  Annette Bening, as usual, plays exceptional well...and the story is so awesome and realistic, it is in fact a lot of people's story.

Can't wait to see again on the upcoming DVD.  MUST-SEE, especially if you're sensitive enough:)))",1281225600,6,314,5.117647058823529
4116072,5,B003EYVXQO,"I saw this movie yesterday and cried, was deeply moved, my heart was touched by this beautiful movie. I am adopted so had been waiting for some time for this movie to be shown, and it far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this movie.",1276819200,4,244,4.444444444444445
4116073,4,B003EYVXQO,"""Mother and Child"" was written and directed by Rodrigo Garca. It came out in 2009 but is now just opening in Indianapolis. The story alludes to many different mother and child relationships but mainly focuses on three women: a 50 year old woman played by Annette Benning, the 37 year old daughter she gave up for adoption played by Naomi Watts, and another woman looking to adopt a child of her own played by Kerry Washington.

Even though there are cases of a man and a woman together discussing a child, the focus is always on the woman's reaction and emotions to events going on around her. It may sound chick-flicky, but this was a powerful drama that transcends that. This was a very effective piece of work carried off brilliantly mostly due to these three women and a few more besides.

Annette Bening hasn't lost her touch. Her character, Karen had to give up her baby for adoption at age 14 and it has plagued her life nonstop ever since. She never moved out and still takes care of her ill and aged mother, Nora played by Eileen Ryan who made this decision for her. To say she is a very ""difficult"" person to get close to would be an understatement, she is practically a hedgehog! The only coping mechanism she appears to get by with is writing letters in a journal to the daughter she never met wondering how she is and if she was raised well. Bening successfully froze herself at the social development state of a 14 year old in interacting with others and is very guarded even when attempting to ask a new man at her workplace out for coffee.

Her unknown daughter, Naomi Watts' Elizabeth has raised herself well after never being very close with her adopted parents and being self sufficient since age 17. She is a very successful lawyer who has been paving a very smooth path for herself though it has been full of detours since she moves around often. Elizabeth too is a very guarded person, but she does it with extreme confidence and very willful sexual pursuits. Watts plays Elizabeth as an individual so strong that it is also her weakness as she refuses to accept help from others as part of her rigid independence.

Kerry Washington's character, Lucy and her husband, Joseph (David Ramsey) have been unable to conceive for four years so they are now pursuing adoption and are undergo the rigorous interviewing process of a 20 year old pregnant college student (Shareeka Epps). Once again, it just goes to show how much more difficult it is to get through the adoption process than successfully having your own child and that always makes me wish natural parenting should have to take a test or something. Kerry Washington gives an outstanding performance of a woman so frustrated by her limitations and desperate to be approved to be a mother. Washington in one scene was THIS close to bringing me to tears and I personally have no interest in having a child but her intense fighting desire to have a baby just got to me. Her mother is played by one of my favorite ""Law & Order"" actors, S. Epatha Merkerson whose no nonsense approach always sets Washington's character, Lucy on edge but at the same time Lucy needs to be snapped out of it sometimes to grow up.

One of my other favorite characters in this film was Sister Joanne played by Cherry Jones who was the Madam President on ""24"" for the last two seasons. I absolutely adore her and she got to play into her caring sensibilities and kind nature in a very difficult occupation trying to help people connect when they are the most emotionally vulnerable.

Sure, there were plenty of guy characters in this story but the story was written for and to appeal to women primarily and it succeeds by leaps and bounds in telling an emotional story that appeals to that ingrained maternal instinct in all of us by moreover reminds us once again how short life is and that you have to act quickly if you do not want to suffer thirty plus years of regret. Nice drama.",1276214400,28,3935,4.558698727015559

4116091,4,B003EYVXQO,"Annette Bening is receiving plenty of justified positive attention for her role in The Kids Are All Right, but this even less seen obscure film displays her acting prowess, in my opinion, in even greater quantity and substance.  The ensemble cast supports her in telling the interwoven tales of various mothers and children  those desired, those given up (reluctantly and otherwise) and those who perhaps should not have had children at all. This is not the crowd pleaser territory of the also terrific The Kids Are All Right, but it is equally, if not more, worth your time.  @kmptop10",1428278400,,586,4.898989898989899

If you are an adoptive parent or have somehow been blessed or touched by adoption in your life then this is in my opinion an important film to see.  You will notice some outdated terminology, such as ""gave up for adoption"" vs. ""made adoption plans.""  So much of this hit home for my family.  Naomi Watts is brilliant as always as are Samuel Jackson and Kerri Washington.  Annette Bening is also great but I had trouble buying her in her role.

Would see again, but would not pay a dime more than what I spent.

4116116,5,B003EYVXQO,"This film still haunts me, but in a good way. Few films have the rawness of this film, and few films have the guts to let their actresses ACT.  Perhaps it's because I relate to her, Benning's work is excruciatingly real and believable. The writer and director created a masterpiece, but the actors brought it to life.  You could literally feel where Benning's character had gotten stuck emotionally at 14. This film is definitely a tear-jerker, but for the right reasons. You never feel manipulated, but the entire story is so bittersweet.

For any birthmothers/first mothers out there, this film will affect you strongly, no doubt, so it may be a good DVD to watch alone or with someone close to you that knows what you've been through. Not a flick to put on with the entire family or a date, or acquaintances, if you have that experience in your life. But it's definitely something you should see.",1412380800,,899,4.677215189873418

But Kerry Washington is also, as well as all the supporting cast like Jimmy Smits (why doesn't he do anything any more?) and the incomparable Samuel L. Jackson (Snakes on a Plane, REALLY?). The depths at which this film explores the very fragile relationship between mothers and their children is quite astounding. Even explores this dynamic from the perspective of adoption and surrogacy as well. Although this could certainly be considered a ""chick flick"", I think even the guys will appreciate the excellent story and performances.

4116185,4,B003EYVXQO,"The acting and topics of this film are about as engaging as they can possibly be.  It's the subtext that bothers me.  Women are portrayed as vile human garbage outside the narrow scope of mothering.  Men are portrayed as clueless, spineless, slow, selfish, absent emotional amateurs at all life's critical junctures.  It's deeply honest about certain emotional realities and criminally evasive of others.",1349913600,2,404,5.365079365079365
4116186,4,B003EYVXQO,"The stories of several mothers are interwoven in this drama about motherhood: The longing to become a mother; the pains of motherhood; the heart-wrenching suffering of those who wish to evade motherhood. It is a sad story. The joy of motherhood hardly features in this film. It is about women. They dominate the film. Men play a secondary, most of the time flat and unassuming role. Men can be thoughtful, kind and sensitive, but they have nothing to say in motherhood. This film is about the hard, lonely world of mothers.

Karen (Annette Bening) gave birth to her only child when she was fourteen and gave her up for adoption. This momentous event ruined her life. Consumed by guilt, she was unable to establish any meaningful relationships with men. She lived with her mother until her mother died but both women did not really open themselves for one another. Karen knows she is ""difficult"": judgmental, stubborn, opinionated, uncompromising, determined, strong-willed, and very lonely. Although her daughter plays very important part in her life, Karen never tried to look for her.

Everything changes when Paco (Jimmy Smits) enters her life. It was not easy for him to penetrate the stubborn-sturdy walls that Karen erected around herself but he finds a way, to Karen's surprise. ""Where did you come from?"" she asks him. Karen's opened to Paco's abundant kindness, and quickly marries him. Paco ""leads his way"" to persuade her to look for her daughter, Elizabeth.

Elizabeth (Naomi Watts) had a very difficult life. From a very young age, she had to live alone and to force herself  into the world. Ambitious, unflinching, smart, selfish with many qualities of her mother (judgmental, stubborn, opinionated, uncompromising, determined, strong-willed) she leads a lonely life in which she finds satisfaction. Happiness would be a big word to describe her condition and constant mood. She moves in and out of cities for unclear reasons but we can guess these constant moves were due to her difficult personality and the way she treats others, especially men: Use, play with and throw. Men are attracted to her like flies to light. Incapable of loving anyone, including herself, people are for her mere means to an end. Stubborn and fearful like her mother, Elizabeth never tried to look for her roots until she becomes pregnant at the age of 37. At about the same time, not knowing of one another, both Karen and Elizabeth deposit letters for each other in the adoption offices.

The third story is about Lucy (Kerry Washington) who is unable to conceive. To satisfy her husband's yearning for a child, she turns to adoption to make the family they desire. Joseph, her husband, encapsulates the role of men in this film: he hardly speaks, with a flat personality and simple desires. Lucy does not really need him. Indeed, the road to adoption is especially difficult for Lucy but once she is able to have a child, she fails to understand that motherhood is indeed ""all about her"": her child's wishes, her milk, her sleep, her quality time. Lucy's mother has to open her eyes to tell her that she is not special. Yes, this is motherhood (parenthood).

The film is built around two wonderful actresses: Naomi Watts and Annette Bening. Kerry Washington, Jimmy Smits and Samuel L. Jackson are in the supporting roles. It is very dense and very sad. There are no moments of comic relief and only seldom we see the magical, beautiful, happy moments of parenthood. There is only one striking episode of family life, to which Elizabeth enters quite astonished as she never experienced such a playful gathering in her own life. The movie, in many respects, is one sided as it highlights the pains of motherhood, not the joys, and it is about motherhood, not parenthood. The three main stories are about broken families. For many of us, luckily life is far more complex, with many shades of grey and pink, not only grey.

It was interesting to find that I could relate to all three of the main characters, even though my own experience is as an adoptee. I related to the mother since I did lose a baby myself, to the daughter since I deal with her feelings daily, and even to the adopting mother because of the lessons learned about parenting ANY child, no matter blood related or not.  (I sent a postcard to my estranged biological mother telling her to watch this movie.)

4116191,5,B003EYVXQO,"Mother and Child is a really compelling drama.  And when I say ""compelling"" I actually think it's impossible to BE more compelling than what's presented here.  Mother and Child is truly a phenomenal movie from a storytelling perspective.

The way all the events unfold... well to be honest, Mother and Child is most certainly one of those films where it's best to not give too much away because if you do, you'll end up spoiling major chunks of crucial storyline elements that are best to discover on your own.  Trust me, this is one of those movies!!

I WILL tell you a few things so you at least have an idea what to expect.  I will tell you what happens in the beginning.  You have 3 separate storylines.  One involves a middle aged woman looking for a romance while taking care of her mother.  The other involves a couple who can't have a baby but discover a woman willing to give up her baby IF she believes the couple are capable and responsible enough for her child.  The final one is about Naomi Watt's character playing a strong independent woman.  Let's just say, she's sleazy and leave it at that.

Now here's what makes the film work so beautifully.  Not only do ALL 3 of these storylines gradually and carefully develop into something more, but to touch it all off, each story is actually *related* and ties together in some way.  Piece by piece, little by little, you will find this out on your own so paying extremely close attention is absolutely necessary in this case.  It's an unbelievably well-executed storyline.  As you can guess, mentioning anything more means I'll end up explaining the whole movie in detail and well, that would be entirely rude on my part!  I can't do it!

Seriously though, this is a top-notch drama from beginning to end with little in the way of flaws.  There are no flaws.  Oh, and the blind girl we meet later on is an *amazing* actress.  She delivers each line with confidence and perfection.

Overall, I highly recommend it.  You will be attached to your television screen for exactly 2 hours (because that's how long it is).",1331769600,2,2075,4.578804347826087

The Film 4.5/5

In the special features, director Rodrigo Garcia describes Mother and Child as ""a drama for grown-ups"" and he's exactly right. The film is aimed at people who enjoy emotional drama, and examining the connections between people. While I was watching, I found myself comparing the structure of the story to 21 Grams and Babel, only to find that the director of those films, Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, was listed as an executive producer.

The film follows three story arcs and ultimately brings them together.

The most interesting character is Karen (Bening) who had a baby girl when she was 14 and gave her up for adoption. We see how she cares for her own mother and puts her life on hold because of her. But on some level, she wonders what happened to her own child. She mentions in the opening minutes of the film that her daughter's birthday is coming up and she'll be 37.

We then see Elizabeth (Watts) applying for a job as a lawyer. She mentions that she was adopted and that her mother had her when she was 14. Her potential employer, Paul (Jackson), is impressed by her honesty and credentials and she gets the job.

A third woman, Lucy (Washington), is unable to have children of her own and is desperate to adopt. We see her and her husband interviewed by a nun to see whether they are a suitable couple.

The story shows how Karen and Elizabeth have been affected by never knowing each other:

Karen devotes her life to looking after her mother and working as a geriatric nurse. She has never been married. Her maid has a little girl and Karen resents having her show up at her house. It seems that she has distanced herself from children and resents people who have children in their lives. Her own loss was an event that she has never recovered from. She's abrupt and sometimes rude to people and ensures that she never gets close enough to men to develop any romantic feelings. Everything she does is designed to protect herself from any potential pain in the future.

Elizabeth is fiercely independent. She seduces Paul and is the dominant partner when they have sex. She's also happy to pursue married men and makes a move on one of her neighbors. As we learn more about her, it becomes clear how she's been affected by never knowing her mother. I won't reveal those details because it would ruin the story. She regularly moves around from one place to another and seems unwilling to be tied down. Although she has a lot of ambitious goals, they have to be achieved on her terms. She's not a very nice person, but maybe it's not completely her fault.

Lucy is willing to do almost anything to become a parent. She meets a young girl who wants to audition her to decide whether she's a suitable foster parent for the child she plans to give up for adoption. Some of the questions disturb her, but she answers them honestly. Her husband doesn't appear to be as enthusiastic about the process, but Lucy persists.

That's the setup. I can't give away anything else without ruining some of the surprises. All three women experience events which change them. Karen undergoes the biggest change and grows as a person throughout the story.

I made a point of seeing the 10 Best Picture nominations last year and enjoyed them all, but I would rank Mother and Child above five of them. The acting is strong across the board and I'm a little surprised that Bening wasn't nominated for this role rather than for her role in The Kids Are All Right. Mother and Child wouldn't work without her performance. We see her accepting her situation, reacting when an event changes it, and ultimately transforming herself into a different person. She shows a vast range of emotions and, although I greatly admire American Beauty, this might be her strongest performance to date.

Watts, Washington, Jackson and Jimmy Smits also turn in good performances and I believed in everything they did. Those that I haven't mentioned were great too.

I didn't hear a word about the film during its limited theatrical run. The marketing just didn't exist as far as I saw. I understand the reasoning and know that the audience for an emotional drama is small and growing smaller every year, but it pains me to see films like Mother and Child ignored. Will they eventually cease to be made so that we can have more sequels? Probably so. But I'll try to do my part and highlight those worthy of attention.

Video Quality 4.5/5
Mother and Child was shot digitally, but it doesn't detract from the overall look. Detail is strong and I didn't detect any flaws. There are a few releases with better picture quality, but this is right up there and you won't have any complaints.

Audio Quality 4/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track does exactly what it is supposed to do. It's a quiet story, driven by dialogue, but everything sounds clear. The ambient sounds add to the experience, but don't expect your speakers to receive much of a workout. It's just not that kind of movie.

Previews

BD-Live

Mother and Child was one of the best dramas released in 2010. Anchored by a stellar performance from Bening, none of the acting disappoints. The title sounds boring and hardly anyone bothered seeing it, but fans of emotional drama shouldn't miss this one. There are quite a few surprises and deeper connections between some of the characters that I didn't mention for fear of spoiling the film. If action is your thing, give this a miss.

4116200,5,B003EYVXQO,"I would like to know what kind of research went into this film, it was really hitting the mark. The cast is amazing, the story is very real. Not sure if people who haven't been touched by the adoption triad would get it as much. But being very close to an adoptee...Naomi Watts charater was really on the money. The perverse disconnect, trapped emotions, need to dominate and control taking over a very soft sentimental side deeply buried. ...It is hard for some people to watch. Its one of the best films I've ever seen. The entire thing is flawless. And its the topic no one ever discusses. Brave film.",1306972800,4,604,4.5
4116201,5,B003EYVXQO,"You have to dig deep in the reviews previous to this to discover any with significant quibbles with MOTHER AND CHILD. Most mention the acting, which I agree is quite suitable for the film and story. At one point, within perhaps 10 seconds, Annette Bening's face undergoes a gamut of emotions like nothing I have ever seen -- all of which were taken from some deep place within. I've enjoyed Bening before, but never to the degree I did in this film. Naomi Watts was quite amazing as well. I was struck by the similarities of this particular mother and child, despite their never having had a chance to actually interact. One thing I believe is missing from most of the other reviews is the extreme intelligence of the script. Rodrigo Garcia deserves much praise for writing a story which is dead on for the emotions needed. He is a good example of what any scenarist/director should aim for. Near the end of the film (no spoiler, so read on), Bening gives a little mirthful laugh which seems quite out of context. When it is revealed what the laugh is about, and the subtle yet direct way in that revealing--well wow, what a moment! Yes, the film is luminous.",1304467200,,1159,4.55023923444976
4116202,4,B003EYVXQO,"While it doesn't entirely get every `thread' right, `Mother and Child' has a beautiful way of weaving together the lives of three women, connected by a similar theme; adoption.  The predictable ending leads way to some eye-rolling, especially in the shameless way it embraces the preposterous, but the film's biggest asset cannot be faulted.

It contains some magnificent character development and stunning performances throughout.

The film opens with a young fourteen-year-old girl giving herself away and getting pregnant.  That baby is then given up for adoption.  That fourteen year-old girl grows up to be the very reclusive and emotionally unstable Karen; still living at home with her dying mother and longing to be reunited with her daughter.  Her daughter, Elizabeth, is grown and living in the same city working as a very successful lawyer.  Their separate lives are interwoven with that of another woman, Lucy, who has struggled to get pregnant with her husband before deciding to adopt a child.  Each woman is struggling in their own ways to find themselves and in the process find themselves separating from those around them.  Karen has no relationship with her mother.  She is overbearing and jealous and untrusting.  Elizabeth is cautious and bitter and deceitful; throwing her body at any man who will look.  Lucy is self-loathing and unstable.

All of these women are reaching for something to make them whole.

As the story unfolds it begins to take too many obvious turns that lead it down the road of the predictable, clich&eacute;d and unrealistic, but I understand where writer/director Rodrigo Garcia was going with this.  In the end though, it really isn't the plot that draws you in but the way these women are fleshed out with magnificent touches.

Annette Bening, Kerry Washington and Naomi Watts are all, well, flawless here.  Annette Bening layers Karen in a way that allows us to become endeared by her prickly demeanor.  We understand and relate to her loss and her desire to be reconciled with what she never wanted to give away.  Annette taps into the childlike naivety that comes from such an emotional stunting without every making Karen feel like a caricature.  Kerry Washington (one of those actresses I can't wait to watch in whatever she does) handles the restrained nature of her character with such sharpness.  She feels so human, so approachable.  Her big `breakdown' scene is heartbreaking and infused with such earnestness.  But, the real star of this show is Naomi Watts.  She just blew me away with her multi-layered portrayal of Elizabeth.  Her hard exterior, tough as nails and wholly confident, is beset by her ability to strip her facial expressions to relay a deep-seated pain.  She handles her characters immorality with shades of realism, creating someone who isn't a mere stereotype but someone who is as three dimensional as they come.  The small things (like the tears in the elevator) bring this performance to an entirely different level.

And let's not forget the fact that Samuel L. Jackson gives probably his finest performance in over a decade.

So, `Mother and Child' is a film that I'd definitely recommend.  It has such heart and body and really develops its characters so that we become a part of their story.  Cheesy predictability aside, `Mother and Child' is a commendable film that deserves to be seen.",1304294400,,3374,5.036101083032491
4116203,5,B003EYVXQO,"A male friend highly recommended this and I pulled it up on Netflix.  I seldom, if ever, write reviews on movies, but this film was so engrossing and touching that I felt this one deserves the time it takes to write one. I think the director did an outstanding job and Annette Benning, along with the others, were awesome. I saw what she was going through, but it was hard to find sympathy for her, at first.  I was proud of Jimmy Smits losing it in the parking lot.  My man is older, but still gorgeous (don't his eyes just say 'dangerous'?).  Epatha (my fav Law & Order character) was on her JOB! I loved Kerry Washington's face when her mom(Epatha) told her to shape up in no uncertain terms. Naomi Watts had that hard shell, because of her circumstances.  Soon as I can plan to buy this one just so my mom can watch it.  The plot was not hard to follow if you sit still and pay attention.  I didn't forget Sam, because I will watch anything he is in.

4116215,5,B003EYVXQO,"I missed out on this film when it was playing in theaters.  THANK GOD FOR 2nd Chances!!

I don't go out to the movies much anymore (which I used to thoroughly enjoy!!!) because IMHO:  A)I am an adult and I enjoy entertaining, informative and/or interesting movies where I am not spoon fed the plot, and B) high priced celebrities NOT ACTORS BY A LONG SHOT) styling and profiling in fashion designer duds while doing their best to promote product placement and future sequels does not a movie make ...

Mother and Child is one of the best films I have seen in quite some time.  The title intrigued me and what got me to select the film up was the three very different but tied together story lines and the recognizable actors NOT celebrities.  There was no stereotyping of characters, and each member of the ensemble brought their A game.  The supporting players including S Epatha Merkerson, Cherry Jones and Shareeka Epps were no slouches.  Trust and Believe.

I enjoyed the interactions of the couples in each story, the surprise twists that actually were surprises (I didn't see them coming at all!!) and the fact that the stories were 100% believable.  (Other than one very intimate moment between a married couple (Lucy and Joseph), there was only a couple of other scenes that were for adults only.)  Not too racy, but still ...

Mother and Child concretizes that one never knows what people will do or why they do what they do ...  I was surprised, I laughed, I cried and I was moved, plus I learned a few things --- I was entertained!

P.S.  I would have loved had Jimmy Smits played the attorney of his own LA law firm instead of Samuel L. Jackson, would have been a wonderful tip of the hat to his career making turn on LA Law back in the day!",1301356800,2,1753,4.485804416403785
4116216,4,B003EYVXQO,"I can't understand why this gem of a drama has not received wider exposure. I found this as an instant play title on a movie rental site I subscribe to and decided to watch it since it features Annette Bening and Naomi Watts, two actors whose works I appreciate. There's also veteran actor Samuel L. Jackson. Well, this turned out to be a relationship drama that was well-scripted, and the acting was just incredible with a depth of emotions and feelings being credibly portrayed on screen.

The theme of this drama is on human relationships, with the central focus being on the maternal bonds between mother and child and how the lack and absence of this bond impacts three women. Annette Bening plays 51-year-old physical therapist Karen who lives with her aged, ailing mom. Karen is a very bitter person, a result of years of feeling guilt over giving up her infant daughter for adoption after getting pregnant at fourteen. Despite her prickly character, she attracts the attentions of a colleague, a kind and gentle man, Paco (played by Jimmy Smits). Initially Karen rebuffs his attempts to get to know her, but her mother's death acts as a catalyst for changes in Karen's personality.

The other story strand focuses on successful attorney Elizabeth Joyce (Naomi Watts in a compelling performance). Elizabeth is 37-years-old and goes through life without forming any real human bonds. She starts work at a firm run by Paul (Samuel L. Jackson in an understated yet meaningful role), and uses sex as a means of fulfilling the void in her life.

The other storyline centers on a young couple, where the wife, Lucy (Kerry Washington delivering a finely-nuanced performance) is desperate to become a mother and seriously considers adoption, approaching an adoption agency run by Sister Joanne (Cherry Jones).
All three plots intersect, and as the movie progresses, viewers are gradually able to infer what is coming. The story is well-plotted and the dialogue is sharp and well-scripted. The performances of the main cast is credible and powerful, especially the three female leads, and elevates this above an average, clichd melodrama. There were some flaws - for example, Elizabeth has an affair with a next-door-neighbor (a forgettable performance by Marc Blucas) whose wife is expecting. It shows the ruthless and malicious streak in Elizabeth, but then these neighbors just `disappear' - there is no real development of this part of the plot. There are several other inconsistencies, but overall this is a powerful relationship drama that will tug at the heartstrings.",1300665600,2,2573,5.063679245283019

4116221,4,B003EYVXQO,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Mother and Child' is one of those melodramas that manage to rise above the usual didactic characters and plot contrivances, typical of the genre.  Sensitively written by Rodrigo Garcia (son of the famous novelist, Gabriel Garcia Marquez), it focuses on three separate characters and plot lines, which finally converge, establishing the connection between each one.

The principal characters of the screenplay fit into Screen writing Guru Michael Hague's category of Primary Characters which include Hero, Nemesis, Reflection and Romance. The hero, who is the primary character, has an outer motivation that drives the plot forward. In the case of 'Mother and Child', that would be Karen, smartly played by Annette Bening. Her outer motivation is to find the daughter she gave up for adoption as a 14 year old. Karen is a bit darker and more complex than your usual melodramatic heroine. Due to her bitterness over the loss of her daughter, as well as being forced to take care of a dying mother, Karen has become hyper-critical toward others, especially men. Some internet posters had trouble believing Paco (Jimmy Smits), the co-worker Karen ends up marrying, would tolerate her petulant behavior; and yes, he's a bit of a caricature of the understanding lover--but they do have a few powerful scenes together. One such scene that comes to mind is when Paco leaves the tomatoes tacked up on the wall, and Karen, on one of her 'bad hair days', rips into him most inappropriately. Another good scene underscores another one of Karen's flaws (jealously)--this is when Karen grabs the necklace from her housekeeper's daughter, denying that her (now deceased) mother would have given it to the little girl as a gift.

The nemesis is the character who most stands in the way of the hero in achieving her outer motivation. This is Elizabeth, brilliantly played by Naomi Watts. The Elizabeth character is what enables 'Mother and Child' to rise above the clichs of the typical soaper. Elizabeth stymies Karen from achieving her outer motivation of accomplishing the mother-daughter reunion. What's interesting is that, as it turns out, this is more a matter of fate than Elizabeth's conscious decision (although some of Elizabeth's choices, lead to a tragic conclusion).

Elizabeth is a wonderfully complex character in that we root for and against her at the same time. She's a high-powered, successful lawyer, who goes through life with a heart of steel, utilizing her sexuality to get what she wants. She has no qualms about bedding her boss, nice guy Paul (Samuel Jackson) and then seducing a young next door neighbor who appears to be happily married. Elizabeth's venomous demeanor can be directed at both men and women. There's that scene where she places her underwear in her next door neighbor's drawer (I felt a bit cheated that the director chose not allow us to see the wife's reaction). And there's also that amazingly powerful scene where Elizabeth uses the 'C' word, chastising the doctor who makes the mistake of assuming that she wants an abortion. Once Elizabeth becomes pregnant, she becomes more human. She gives of herself by befriending a blind girl but once again her willfulness does her in--she insists on seeing her baby when it's born, instead of opting for a C-section or anesthesia. Without giving the plot away, her decision results in tragic consequences.

Hague also uses the term ""Reflection"" as another category involving the primary characters. In reflection, we have a character that supports the hero's outer motivation. Here Lucy (Kerry Washington) ultimately fulfills Karen's motivation by adopting Elizabeth's daughter. Before that happens, there's some rather intense interplay between Lucy and the birth mother, Ray (Shareeka Epps), who ends up changing her mind about giving up her newborn after her tough as nails mother influences her in that direction.

Finally, the romance character is the sexual or romantic object of hero's outer motivation. I understand that Mr. Garica (who also directed), needed to keep the story moving but the relationship between Karen and her romantic partner, Paco, seemed a bit rushed. You can practically blink your eyes, and suddenly Karen and Paul are married. Samuel Jackson's character, Paul, as Elizabeth's short-term partner, is interesting as he comes off as completely passive, due to having lost his wife a few years earlier. This passivity is illustrated when Elizabeth gets on top of him when they make love and she orders him to passively enjoy himself, as she basically is 'in charge'. Lucy's husband, who we see briefly in the first half of the film, has one of the best moments when he surprises us by walking out on his shattered wife.

There are other good characters in 'Mother and Child', too numerous to mention here. Despite the rather predictable 'happy ending' and the over the top coincidence that Karen and Lucy have been in close proximity to one another for quite some time, 'Mother and Child' is an impressive achievement. What I like about this film is that there are so many twists and turns that are constantly popping up. The characters might be a little over the top, but the emotions they display, are truly heartfelt and true to life.",1297209600,,5281,5.062068965517241
4116222,1,B003EYVXQO,"Ok- did anyone who rated this movie actually SEE it???  The plot was messy- at best.  There was zero flow.  And many of the scenes didn't make any sense.  My friend and I were scratching our heads through most of it trying to figure out ""where did THAT come from"".  I expected that they would pull it all together at the end, but not so much.  What happened to the father?  What happened to the next door neighbors?  Why were they even introduced??  And who in the world was in the second picture at the end???  It wasn't the mother at 14... (or if it was supposed to be, it looked nothing like the girl at the beginning of the movie.)  I suppose it could have been the grandmother... but again, the significance??  The questions go on...

I'm not even sure how to describe the genre.  It wasn't touching.  It wasn't informative.  It wasn't comedic.  The best scene in the movie was where the adopting mother broke down in her first weeks with the newborn and expressed the same type of guilt-producing feelings that every mother feels at one point or another during infancy but is too ashamed to speak out loud.

And last but not least, the description of ""brief sexuality"" is highly misleading.  That was 50% of the movie... involving some characters who had zero significance other than to bring more of it to the set, as best I can tell.  1/2 a star simply for peaking our interest enough to finish it.",1296777600,,1406,4.43921568627451
4116223,4,B003EYVXQO,"After his rather disappointingly mediocre ""The Passengers,"" Rodrigo Garca (""Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her"" ""Nine Lives) has come back with ""Mother and Child,"" an impressive drama with nice ensemble cast including Annette Bening, Naomi Watts and Kerry Washington. The emotionally-charged film may look melodramatic to some, but the dramatic tension bolstered by the fine acting makes the film compelling.

The interconnected story (told in a Robert Altman way) follows the life of three women: Annette Bening's Karen, a fifty-something caregiver who had given up her daughter Elizabeth for adaption when she was 14 years old; Naomi Watt's Elizabeth, a hardworking lawyer who knows nothing about her biological mother; and Kerry Washington's Lucy, a happily married baker who wants to adapt a baby.

The personalities of the three heroines, all flawed like any of us, will be revealed in the interactions with supporting (yet equally important) characters. The ""difficult"" Karen comes to know more about herself and her problems through her good-natured co-worker Paco (Jimmy Smits), and her housemaid Sofia (Elpidia Carrillo) who brings her daughter to Karen's house. The unfolding drama is sometimes sweet, sometimes painful.

The film does not shy away from portraying poignant moments of life -- meeting your first love for the first time after more than thirty years, or knowing what your mother was really thinking in the most unexpected way -- but it does so without making them too depressing for audiences. The deceptively simple episodes of the three heroines and those around them living their ordinary lives hide their inner struggles and conflicts. In ""Mother and Child"" they all have to face them sooner or later.

Other supports include Amy Brenneman, Shareeka Epps, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Samuel L. Jackson, Cherry Jones, David Morse, David Ramsey and Eileen Ryan.

A riveting drama ""Mother and Child"" succeeds thanks to the strong acting from the cast, especially the three leads, giving depth and complexity to the characters.",1296691200,,2051,5.317901234567901
4116244,5,B003EYVXQO,It's amazing how people lives turn out but I say it is better to know than not to know who your biological parents are. This movie showed the good and the bad but it is life and what you choose to do with yours will affect everyone around you.,1296691200,,243,3.979591836734694
4116245,5,B003EYVXQO,"I've never been moved by a movie enough to write a review but I loved this movie. All of the performances were superb. Annette Bening and Naomi Watts are always excellent but the roles they had in this film really highlighted how adept they both are at playing complex women with a lot of internalization and yet, offering the audience the chance to really see how their characters think and why they react the way they do.  I was amazed and awestruck. Samuel L. Jackson was heartbreaking, Jimmy Smits was warm and soulful and S. Epatha Merkerson's character had the best line in the movie, which she delivered with a combination of authority and love at just the right moment (the way only a good mother can). Kerry Washington's performance in a particular scene was so real and so affecting that I had to pause the movie to get more kleenex. The director allowed the story to be told, with a pacing that showed restraint and respect for the writing.  This movie was beautiful and I loved it.",1296604800,3,993,4.573033707865169
4116246,5,B003EYVXQO,"This film is another triumph from Rodrigo Garc&iacute;a and Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu - two of the most gifted artists in film today.  Written and directed by Rodrigo Garc&iacute;a (with his partner in the guiding role of producer) MOTHER AND CHILD  is another means of telling stories that intertwines many lives that are united in fascinating and meaningful, purposeful ways.  The film is a discourse on motherhood in all its parameters: rarely has this familiar subject been treated with deeper understanding and probing intelligence and emotion.

Opening in black and white we see a young 14 year old girl having what seems to be her first physical encounter with a boy.  The film then jumps forward 37 years and gradually each of the characters is introduced. Karen (Annette Bening in a stunning performance) is an acerbic, lonely physical therapist caring for her aged mother (with the help of housekeeper Sofia (Elpidia Carrillo) whose young daughter Cristi (Simone Lopez) accompanies her loving mother when Cristi is not in school - an aggravating nuisance to Karen who is rigidly attempting to keep her life in order.  Karen, we learn, has a 37 year old daughter Elizabeth (Naomi Watts) she gave up for adoption but who haunts her every moment sad and guilt ridden moment as she cares for her dying mother.  Elizabeth (who has never investigated her birth mother but instead has lived a life of being alone and driven to be a successful lawyer) is interviewed by a powerful attorney Paul (Samuel L.  Jackson) for an important position in a major law firm in Los Angeles. Though Elizabeth's heart seems frozen she knows how to get what she wants and manages to seduce Paul, while carrying on an affair with her next door neighbor Steven (Marc Blucas) who is married to a very pregnant Tracy (Carla Gallo). Despite the fact that Elizabeth had an elective tubal ligation at age 17 she becomes pregnant with Paul's child, decides to keep the child but to move away from Paul, and finds a job elsewhere awaiting the birth of her baby, endangered by a diagnosis of placenta previa.

At work Karen meets widower Paco (Jimmy Smits) and after multiple insulting encounters with him begins to date Paco, who in turn helps Karen unravel her life long agony for giving up her child Elizabeth for adoption.  They meet with Sister Joanne (Cherry Jones) who runs the adoption agency and Karen places a letter in the file of the girl she has never met.  By coincidence Elizabeth also places a letter in the file as she grows fond of being pregnant.  And in another important sidebar episode a young barren couple Lucy (Kerry Washington) and Joseph (David Ramsey) decide to adopt a child: Lucy runs a bakery with her mother Ada (S. Epatha Merkerson, another brilliant though subdued role for this gifted actress) and Joseph's parents are against the idea of Joseph not finding someone who can produce HIS child.  The couple meets with Sister Joanne who in turn introduces a feisty young pregnant Leticia (Lisa Gay Hamilton) who reluctantly agrees under her own terms that Lucy and Joseph can adopt her imminent fetus.  Things happen and each of these characters changes, no plan turns out as predicted, yet everything comes together in the strangest of ways.

The movie successfully examines the mother/child relationship with five stories that are intimately connected - but we don't know until the end just how these connections play out.  The entire cast - which also includes the gifts of  Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a, David Morse, Shareeka Epps, Amy Brenneman, Tatyana Ali , Eileen Ryan, and more - is committed and credible.  Every aspect of this film is brilliantly conceived and executed. It deserves the highest awards.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 11",1295654400,,3782,4.982511923688394
4116247,5,B003EYVXQO,"Mother and Child tells a very poignant story of three women struggling to have a better life for themselves while coping with adoption issues; and indeed the acting is so fine that you'll feel like you were there, watching it all play out. With a cast including Naomi Watts, Annette Bening, Samuel L. Jackson, Jimmy Smits and Kerry Washington, you just know this is going to be an incredible movie from the word ""go."" There's so much more to like about this movie, too--it has a strong musical score, supporting actors who enhance the plot, an excellent script and superb choreography and cinematography. This is one of those films that makes you think that it was truly a labor of love to produce; and that's grand.

When the film starts, we get a brief flashback of two rather young teenagers being intimate with each other; and then the fourteen year old mother, Karen (Alexandria M. Salling; and played by Annette Bening in the rest of the movie) gives up her child for adoption. The film then flashes forward and we see how Karen remains incredibly scarred by having to give up her baby girl for adoption; and she is burdened even more by being the main caretaker for her elderly mother Nora (Eileen Ryan) while working as a physical therapist.

We also meet Karen's daughter who goes by the name Elizabeth (Naomi Watts); she is a talented young lawyer climbing up the ladder at a firm led by Paul (Samuel L. Jackson). Elizabeth never wanted to find her biological father; and her tough exterior serves as armor to protect her from the fact that she never got the nerve to find her biological mother. In addition, we meet Lucy (Kerry Washington) and her husband Joseph (David Ramsey); they want to adopt a child because they cannot have one of their own.

From here the plot becomes much more complicated; Elizabeth and Paul start an affair and Karen tries to expose herself to some vulnerability when Paco (Jimmy Smits), a co-worker of hers, shows romantic interest in her. Paco eventually encourages Karen to look for her daughter as well. Lucy and Joseph run into unexpected complications after they meet a young twenty year old named Ray (Shareeka Epps) who wants to give up her baby for adoption--if they can measure up to Ray's standards, that is!

The three-story line approach taken by writer/director Rodrigo Garca works brilliantly; the film takes the time to do exceptional character development while keeping things moving along so that any audience shouldn't feel bored. There are several completely unexpected plot twists; and that's good because that's how things often are in real life. While I don't want to give any spoilers, I do want to mention that the last ten minutes of the film took me by complete surprise and I was so moved I cried; and I rarely cry so I think the cast and crew did a superlative job working together on Mother and Child.

Look also for other fine performances by Cherry Jones as Sister Joanne; Marc Blucas, Carla Gallo and Brittany Robertson as three of Elizabeth's neighbors; and S. Epatha Merkerson as Ada, Lucy's mother. Elizabeth Pea also does a great job playing Amanda, the lady who comes in to Karen's home to clean and help care for Nora during the day when Karen has to work--and whose relationship with Karen evolves especially as Karen warms up to Amanda's very young daughter.  In addition, the DVD comes with a few bonuses including deleted scenes.

Mother and Child is one of those few motion pictures that move you and make you think at once. I highly recommend his film for anyone who likes dramas; people exploring and studying issues surrounding adoption; and fans of the actors in this film.",1295481600,,3660,4.745283018867925
