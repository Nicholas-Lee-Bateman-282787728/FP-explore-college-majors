551912,3,6303084257,"WWF SummerSlam 1993 was an average event.  With 4 Championship Titles on the line, there could have been a lot more to see.  WWF Champion-Yokozuna defends the title against ""Made in the U.S.A."" Lex Luger.  WWF  Intercontinental Championship Match:  Champion-Shawn Michaels vs.  Challenger-Mr. Perfect.  This match should decide who truly is the greatest  I.C. Champ of all time.  WWF Tag Team Titles on the line between  Champions-The Steiner Brothers and Challengers-The Heavenly Bodies.  WWF  King of the Ring Title up for grabs between Bret ""Hitman"" Hart  and Jerry ""The King"" Lawler.  Also see Bret Hart wrestle Doink  the Clown, the Rest In Peace match between the Undertaker and Giant  Gonzalez, a 6-man tag between Tatanka & The Smoking Gunns and Bam Bam  Bigelow & The Headshrinkers.  Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Marty  Jannetty vs. Ludvig Borga, 123 Kid vs. I.R.S.",917654400,4,874,5.114285714285714
7836492,2,6303084257,"Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase - In a shocking turn of events weeks after losing to the 1-2-3 Kid, Money Inc. insulted Razor for losing...and turned him babyface in the process.  This was a good opening match that did it's job in getting the crowd hot for the show as these two worked well against each other with Dibiase's heel tactics coming back to haunt him but unfortunally, this would turn out to be Dibiase's last WWE PPV match as he retired shorty afterwards due to a back injury.

WWE Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers vs. Heavily Bodies - The interesting backstory to this match is that the Heavily Bodies were a team from the Smokey Mountain promotion that WWE had a working agreement with as far as using it as a developmental territory (same agreement used with the USWA & later ECW) while this was the homecoming of the Steiners as WWE Tag Team Champions.  The Bodies attacked the Steiner's early & did some double teaming before they recovered to have a back & forth match with Cornette getting involved at times before a mistiming by the Bodies allowed the Steiners to retain the titles.

WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Mr. Perfect - These two had been feuding with each other ever since their backstage brawl at WrestleMania IX & Hennig costing Shawn the Intercontinental Title against Marty Jannetty. These two just flowed with each other with Shawn working over Perfect's lower back. Shawn's bodyguard, Diesel (Kevin Nash), did come into play at times & was the deciding factor in the end of what was otherwise a good match.
(Life & Times Of Mr. Perfect)

1-2-3 Kid vs. I.R.S. - This was the PPV debut of Sean ""1-2-3 Kid"" Waltman and from the start, he had the speed advantage using his martial arts & aerial offense while I.R.S. kept the Kid grounded for a majority of the bout leading to the eventual victory.

Bret Hart vs. Doink The Clown - Bret Hart was suppost to face Jerry Lawler in this match however Lawler claimed to be injured & had Doink replace him.  Doink did his usual ""clowning around"" at ringside with Owen & Bruce Hart leading to Bret starting this match out as a brawl on the outside & in the ring while Doink was able to recover & attempt to make this a wrestling match before Bret could recover causing Lawler to get involved resulting in...

Bret Hart vs. Jerry Lawler - ...him being forced to compete or be banned for life.  This wasn't the ""technical"" match that Bret is known for as the issues regarding him & Lawler was just so personal that this was a complete brawl with both men using Lawler's crutch at various times with Lawler working over Bret's throat.  Bret eventually got the sharpshooter on Lawler for the victory but he was so focused on hurting Lawler than winning that he refused to break the hold for several minutes until Owen & Bruce convinced him to let it go before the whole family tried to attack Lawler as he rode out on the stretcher...the winner.

Marty Jannetty vs. Ludvig Borga - This was nothing more than a squash match to put over the foreign heel in Borga as he was set to feud to Lex Luger.

Rest In Peace Match: Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales - Around this time in Taker's career, he was always facing these limited big gimmicked wrestlers like King Kong Bundy & Kamala & Mr. Hughes but in this case, it was Giant Gonzales.  After seeing the diaster that was their WrestleMania match, this was a glorified ""No Holds Barred"" match which allowed the use of weapons like a chair.  Gonzales dominated until Paul Bearer appeared at ringside & took back his urn from Harvey Wippleman leading to Undertaker dominating his way to victory.

Smokin' Gunns & Tatanka vs. Headshrinkers & Bam Bam Bigelow - This was a good six man tag overall as all six men worked well together with Headshrinkers' manager Afa also getting his shot on while Bigelow once again had his moments showing while he's one of the best big men in the business as him & Tatanka did stereo attempts at a crossbody block while later executing a dropkick.

WWE Champion Yokozuna vs. Lex Luger - ""The bodyslam heard around the world"" followed by the campaign known as the ""Lex Express"" lead up to this match here with both the Japanese & American National Anthem (performed by Aaron Neville), Randy Savage was the ""Master Of Ceremonies"" for this match, this was set to be Luger's only title match, and Luger had his forearm heavily protected.  Yokozuna attempted several times to cheat by using the salt bucket & even Mr. Fuji throwing powder while dominating the match with various moves to wear Lex down like a nervehold.  Luger was on the defense most of the time here building various comeback attempts before he finally got enough momentum to knock Yokozuna out of the ring & on the floor to the point where he couldn't get back in the ring in time to lose the match on a countout leaving Luger & several other babyfaces celebrated the victory as if he won the championship...which he didn't on what was suppost to be his own title match.  Quite frankly, I'm not a huge fan of either guy as both are very limited in what they can do but for all the hype this match had, they didn't deliver a quailty main event eventhough they did a better job at WrestleMania...and the ending with them celebrating eventhough Luger didn't win the championship came off completely stupid to me.  If you didn't win the championship in your only title match, would you be celebrating if you didn't win the title?  I rest my case.

In the end, this was a very forgettable PPV as it had some good matches (Razor/Dibiase, Perfect/Michaels, Bret/Doink & Lawler, six man tag) but none of them stood out or were anything really memorable while the rest of the card was pretty much a dud so this isn't an event I would look up on it own & get it as part of the SummerSlam anthology if you just need to see this show.",1278460800,,5847,4.553860819828408
7836493,2,6303084257,"Summerslam 1993 was built around The Lex Express and how he was going lead WWF into the future. By now you know thats was not the case. Vince McMahon is horrible on commentary as he botches plenty of moves.

Razor Ramon VS Ted DiBiase: Ramon was in shape and not a fat, lazy drunk. DiBiase's career would soon be over, which is too bad. He had a great gimmick but WWF choose to kept him as a jobber rather then use his talents. DiBiase dominates the whole match and then runs into the turnbuckle, Razor hits the Razor's edge, and its over. A short but good match.

The Steiner Brothers VS Heavenly Bodies: Before Scott was full of steroids, he was a clean cut babyface. Heavenly Bodies put on a great performance but this takes place in Michigan and Steiners are from there, do the math. Ending was very quick and sloppy, like alot of the matches on this card.

Shawn Michaels VS Mr Perfect: Could have been a classic but the ending sucked as Perfect gets counted out. I would have prefered a winner.

IRS VS 1-2-3 Kid: A quick match that was good while it lasted even though some spots looks botched.

Bret Hart VS Doink: It was going be Lawler but he said he was injuried. Bret and Doink have a good match; Hey the first Doink could wrestle a good match. Then Lawler hits Hart with a crutch and costs Doink the match. That leads to Hart VS Lawler and they have a good match but the end result was stupid. Hart used to much pressure on the sharpshooter and gets disqualified.

Ludvig Borga VS Marty Jannetty: Anther quick match. Borga looks green and Jannetty gets in some good offense a few times but Borga wins with Luger's finisher.

Undertaker VS Giant Gonzales: I don't know what the hell a Rest in Peace match is, but it sucked. Undertaker had some pretty crappy feuds early in his career.

Tatanka and Smokin Gunns VS Headshrinkers and Bam Bam Bigelow: A good six man tag with a confusing ending.

Lex Luger VS Yokozuna: After months of build up of trying to be the next Hulk Hogan, Luger falls flat on his face. It was a big blunder by WWF by making people buy this event and most people probably thought he was going win the world title. Luger wins via count out in anther crappy main event. I've said in other reviews and i'll say it again-Summerslam had some of the worst main events for a PPV.

Anther side note, I understand why Randy Savage left WWF. He was left out of Summerslam 93 and 94, doing nothing but being a interviewer. Why did Vince McMahon do this to Savage? We'll never know. I'd love to see Savage back on WWE tv, he was such a great talent.

This event sucked. The first match was good and a few other squash matches were alright. The main event was a joke and The Undertaker was stuck with anther worthless talent.",1237161600,,2746,4.354207436399217
7836494,3,6303084257,"With Hulk Hogan on his way out the door, the WWF needed a new star. Lex Luger was chosen as the next logical choice so they had him go on a campaign in his ""Lex Express"". The whole thing was pure cheese but a lot of fun to watch. Anyone, the new American hero takes on Yokozuna for the WWF Title here.
You also get to see Bret Hart battle not only Doink The Clown but Jerry Lawler as well. You get to see the final match in The Undertaker-Giant Gonzolaez feud. There is also the pay-per-view debut of Ludvig Borga.
On paper, the line-up looked pretty lousy but they did a decent job with it. I'm hoping that one day the WWF (er, WWE) releases the whole Summerslam collection the way they did with Wrestlemania.",1062288000,,710,4.227941176470588
7836495,4,6303084257,"This PPV was such a disaster it defys belief!  So Lex Lugers riding this quote ""wave of momentum"" or so the WWF wants you to believe amd he's riding around in his ""LEX EXPRESS"" leading up to the event, the PPV shows clips of him being Mr. Simaritan its the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  The match itself is a disaster when Yokozuna gets counted out, the WWF superstars all come out and hoist Luger on there shoulders as if he accomplished something great, and ballons come down on the crowd as they make for the exit, the dumb look on lugers face it priceless.  I recommend this for a eyerolling good laugh at Lugers expense, how embarrassing",995673600,,645,4.4491525423728815
7836496,3,6303084257,"This ppv event was first Summerslam w/o Hulk Hogan and man they sure as hell didn't miss his sorry ass.  I'm not saying that this show was great or  anything, but it kicked anything's butt that WCW was doing in 1993, that's  for damn sure.  Anyways, i wish that the WWF would start selling the old  PPVs because they are so hard to find in good condition these days.  I give  this show 3 stars because it was just a regular ppv to me.",967852800,2,434,4.095238095238095
7836497,4,6303084257,"While most people consider this a medicore PPV, they must understand that the talent pool in the WWF was pretty shallow at the time.  Razor vs. Dibiase, Steiners vs. Heavenly Bodies, & Smoking Gunns/Tatanka vs. Bam  Bam Bigelow/Headshrinkers were all excellent matches, if not in actual  wrestling, then in crowd reaction.  This makes sense though (the event took  place in Detroit, home of the Steiners).",953596800,,405,5.1692307692307695
