There is over 7 hours of video on one DVD (the compression need to make it all fit on one DVD explains the limited video quality).  Greg presents a way to consider the climate change issue in a way I hadn't thought of before.  He gives permission to use these videos in whole or part to make new content.  He even gives permission to copy the disk in whole and redistribute it.  No matter what side of the climate change argument you are on, you should see this DVD.  Take the time (7 hours) to watch this.",1428278400,,568,4.165137614678899
8367230,5,B002EAYDH0,"This entire set of vids is available for free.  It's easy to find.  You should buy it anyway, the book too.
This is an incredible video project produced by an ordinary guy who takes his thinking very seriously.  It's true that he's a terminal nerd, but that's ok... so am i.
Anyway, skeptics should watch this more than believers.  About every argument that can be made against concerted action on climate change, which is to say, severely curbing the mass consumption of fossil fuels, is shot down in short order.  Not by the author, mind you, but by credible citations that the author makes and actually encourages the viewer to investigate personally.  That's why it's such a bulletproof set of reasoning.  Skeptics got nothing to compare to it but faith, not reason.
Personally, I believe the sharp and inevitable decline in the ratio of petroleum production to demand is going to ruin everything soon enough, but as this presentation illustrates, I could be wrong.

BTW:  The author of the single negative review of this work extant at the time of this review, posted three times by the way, clearly hasn't watched the vids.  Watch the vids and see for yourself that he made numerous false assertions as bold as claiming the sky is yellow.  Typical behavior of a hard line skeptic, i suppose.

8367231,5,B002EAYDH0,"I followed Greg Craven from the start. I must admit, I had my doubts. But I think his ""teacher-ness"" came thru very well. He had done gobs of homework - read ALL of the replies to his YouTube videos - and separated the logical rebuttals from the crackpots who are easily influenced by those with a vested interest in the ""status quo"". He is wonderfully theatrical; kind of a mix of Carl Sagan and Al Gore. They did not DO the science. They just gave it to the rest of us in readily understandable terms. BRILLIANT!",1270252800,2,514,4.364583333333333
8367232,1,B002EAYDH0,"The entire video set can be reduced to one short sentence. Give in to fear.

Mr. Craven's claim: You can make a rational choice about whether to support political action on global warming without considering whether there's really a problem to address. Make no mistake about it; he expects you to support political action even if you're not convinced that climate change is a problem. It defies common sense, obviously. But once again, we're asked to ignore the obvious for a little more compost in place of reason.

He puts his political action argument in the form of a ""risk analysis;"" one that I'm sure would not survive a cursory review in a first year business course. The bottom line is that if you feel confused by the global warming debate, then you should definitely favor draining trillions of dollars from the world economy even if it causes a world-wide depression and you starve to death as a result. It doesn't matter whether the trillions spent address any real problem or whether political action could do any good even if a real problem exists. You don't need to think about that.

You don't need to think about that because Mr. Craven does it for you, replacing your uncertainty with the fear that we'll face dire consequences if political action is not taken. Here's the trick. He says if you are not certain either way, then you must accept that the alarmists' view ""might be"" true. If it ""might be"" true, then he asserts that you must treat it in your analysis as if it is true. In other words, if you don't know that it's true, then it's true. And by the way; even if you are absolutely certain that global warming is not a problem requiring political action, you're still instructed to act as if it is. After all, you're not infallible (like the warmers are); which equates to uncertainty and by his default reasoning tips the analysis in favor of political action.

Real-world risk assessment does in fact require that you understand what you're talking about. The point is to understand risks and assess their impact. There is no magic that transforms not having a clue into ""a rational response"" to anything.

Bottom line: Mr. Craven is preaching fear of the unknown: telling you to forget about knowledge and reason and to allow yourself to be driven by global warming fear-mongering without question. Be afraid of what ""might be"" imagined as true - even if it's not. It makes you wonder what other compost he might be stuffing into the heads of high school students in place of reason.",1267660800,4,2514,4.691609977324263
8367233,5,B002EAYDH0,"I cannot recommend this collection of videos, originally aired on YouTube, enough. Greg Craven has the spark of genius in the way he cuts through all the crap. On the one hand we have clever wordy scientists and on the other, crafty manipulative, articulate global warming deniers (Ok, I'm a little biased on this one!) and the poor ordinary bloke doesn't know who to believe in the shouting match. He/she just wants to know what's the best bet to protect their loved family and friends. They don't want to risk damaging the economy but they also don't want to risk ruining the planet that their kids will grow up in. How on earth can they decide what's best?

This DVD, and even better the book that grew out of it ""What's the Worst That Could Happen?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-the-Worst-That-Could-Happen-A-Rational-Response-to-the-Climate-Change-Debate/dp/0399535012/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's the Worst That Could Happen?: A Rational Response to the Climate Change Debate</a>, will show the non-expert how they can make their own sensible decisions using the sort of ordinary risk assessment techniques that we all use when we cross the road or buy house or car insurance.

This ""risk assessment"" method might sound dry and dull but Greg is often very funny and he is a natural communicator (he's a science teacher with the gift of humour). It's rather like Carl Sagan meets Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy!

""How It All Ends"" is based on Greg's original 10 minute YouTube video ""The Most Terrifying Video You'll Ever See"" which got many millions of hits. A firestorm of critics descended on that one but Greg didn't give up - he used every helpful or savage critical comment to make his argument stronger. By using the power of the critical Internet crowds he is pretty sure that EVERY counter-argument has been addressed and answered, leaving the full set of ""How it All Ends"" videos (over 7 hours) apparently bullet proof. My only criticism is that the videos were originally for YouTube so don't expect them to look good blown up on your Hi-definition monster flat screen TV...

This just might be the very first time that ""crowd sourcing"" (A.K.A the wisdom of crowds) has been utilised to this extent to refine and polish an argument. The result has been called brilliant.

This is not just another global warming book. This is for everyone. It's funny and entertaining and, above all else, wise - you will say ""YES!, why didn't I think of that - that is so obvious now!"" as Greg cuts though the BS and finds the light switch to clarify matters so clearly that anyone can understand them.

A valuable side effect of the risk assessment system that Greg Craven sketches out is that the very same methods can be used in all sorts of other situations in life to make decisions where the outcome is uncertain, or if there is not quite enough info to give a 100% definite answer based on the known facts. The book is deeper than the video but seeing Greg in person is a joy that you will want to pass on to others.",1247702400,12,3077,4.8963531669865645
