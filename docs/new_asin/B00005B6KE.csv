Aimed basically at those growing at the time the stories are quite juvenile and corny, nevertheless they are well produced and provide a fine nostalgia trip for those of an appropriate age.
From a technical point of view the picture and sound have been remastered and quality is excellent. Extras include Autry sponsoring Wrigley chewing gum and a Gene Autry singalong jukebox !",1044230400,7,534,4.691489361702128
