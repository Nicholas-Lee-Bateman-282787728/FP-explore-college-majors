8030454,4,B0002PYS6K,"Very engrossing low-budget film on Alpha DVD.  It's rather rough print-wise, but with a minimum of splices and perhaps some missing footage.  It's worth a watch, though.  It apparantly was re-released after Jon Hall achieved success because some titles cards have been altered.  The film's title card and cast card have been changed to give Jon Hall first billing(the original billing has Kathleen Burke first and Jon Hall second(at this time he was billed as Charles Locher).  The cast card also eliminates the names of two cast members who were originally listed.",1266710400,4,565,5.0978260869565215
