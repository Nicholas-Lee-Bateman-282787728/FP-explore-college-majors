2306826,2,B0009NZ738,"I know that I'm about to bash a movie that many consider a classic of Argentinian cinema, but hey, controversy rules! So, here it goes.

In 1986, Argentinian director Eliseo Subiela and Argentinian stars Hugo Soto and Lorenzo Quinteros did what we can call a ""predecessor"" to the book by Gene Brewer, K-PAX, witch originated Iain Softley's homonym major hit and masterpiece on the big screen with Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. However, any resemblance on this Argentinian piece with Brewer's book were declared like purely coincidental, as the author declared having knowledge about the movie five years after writing his book.

Coincidence or not, we'll never know for sure. What I know for sure is that K-PAX is far superior than the movie from 1986 in so many senses.

To start with, ""Man Facing Southeast"" (Hombre Mirando Al Sudeste) is a very cold movie. Totally absent of feelings, with cold thematic, script and a very bad acting, and the absence of charisma from the characters makes it even worse. As this is a low budget movie for the age it was made, we can live with the simplistic scenarios, edition and the absence of a mystical and ""out of this world""-like climax (as we see in K-PAX), not counting that it was filmed in a third world country. No problem with those things.

The movie sometimes tries to explain too much things, and looses it's narrative focus, it's not philosophical in any sense. The ""in off"" narration bothers as well, and shows itself unnecessary in most part of the film. The movie have a boring rhythm. Not because it's slow. ""2001 - A Space Odissey"" is an extremely slow movie but keeps itself daring and interesting all the time. The problem with ""Man Facing Southeast"" is that the script looses itself many times in situations that wasn't need to be so detailed. It seems like Subiela wants to regurgitate every information in people's head, not giving space for us to think. The movie looses it's focus so much making people feels so bored and tired that you'll wish it to end in the middle of the film.

As I said before, the acting is poor, very poor. None of the actors convince us in their roles, they act like they don't care. Jeff Bridges was bureaucratic in K-PAX, but still convincing, he was like ""hey, I'm so glad I got this role, I'm really enjoying being here!"" Also, the movie have unnecessary and utterly disgusting sequences, like the ones showing pieces of corpses in laboratory and naked corpses being transported. There's also a sex scene that I believe they did just to show what actress In&eacute;s Vernengo really have under the dress... you know what I mean. Very tiny ones there was no need of that! Things that totally breaks the feel of the story and rips the rest of the good ideas.

The story, by the way, is really similar to K-PAX. Man that appears from nowhere and is sent to a clinic where a psychiatric tries to convince him he's not an alien. As the story goes, we are presented to the past of Rantes, where details of his life are revealed, showing who he really are, witch leads us to the revelations in the end of the tape. Rantes will slowly gain the sympathy from the crazies of the clinic that here, works only as mere supporting cast, with no voice or importance like in K-PAX.

Of course there are positive points in this movie: It ends; it have some nice criticism about future of mankind and the paths that man are taking; the thematic is very interesting, although it's poorly developed; for a low budget movie, it's well produced for that age; the sequence where Rantes conducts an entire orchestra is wonderful; the doctor plays sax very well; the soundtrack of the movie is also brilliant; and it makes me wanting to watch K-PAX all over again.

Bottom line: it's a movie that is worth watching just in case you're curious to see more about Argentinian movies. Maybe some masterpiece like The Motorcycle Diaries could be a better example of what Latin cinema is capable of. So, if you want to watch a better movie with the same plot as Man Facing Southeast, catch a beam of light and watch K-PAX. You'll thank me later.",1157241600,2,4109,4.619178082191781
2306827,4,B0009NZ738,"Did you see K-Pax? Well, that is the plagiarism Hollywood version of this argentine film.

Hombre Mirando al Sudeste (Man Looking Southeast) is a very recommended film",1134259200,6,167,5.185185185185185

8064077,5,B0009NZ738,"A must-see, really great movie, but what I really want to say is the DVD version being sold here is really poor quality. The version available for free on youtube is much better quality. I waited for years for this to come out on DVD and was sorely disappointed (and you certainly don't want to pay collector's item prices).",1426550400,,324,4.508474576271187

8064079,5,B0009NZ738,"I saw this movie when it first came out on VHS and was enthralled.  I have been waiting for a long time for it to come out on DVD, and highly recommend it. It is especially recommended for anyone who likes to be challenged by movies which question the reality of our everyday world.  In other words, anyone who likes Philip K. Dick will love this movie.  Some people criticize it, but then some people think that ""Moby Dick"" is about a big white whale ....  (IMPORTANT NOTE: This is apparently not sub-titled in English, according to another reviewer who checked with the vendor.)",1381708800,,580,4.548076923076923
8064080,5,B0009NZ738,"Precursor to the Kevin Spacey mess, this is the original. Can provoke hours of discussion on many points.  Excellent direction, suitably-creepy score.  Acting is first-rate, and Hugo Soto is completely convincing.  Can't wait for this to appear with English subtitles.  Well, I guess I can wait. Have been waiting for years, and my VHS copy is on its last legs.",1328140800,8,361,4.966666666666667
8064081,5,B0009NZ738,"Do not pay any attention to rapt3's review as he could not be more wrong about this wonderful film. This is an exceptional, literate movie that explores meaning and living fully. It's a crime it hasn't been released in DVD format and only old, used VHS copies are available for sale. By the way, I checked with the vendor and this edition does NOT contain English subtitles.",1311724800,23,374,4.597014925373134
8064082,4,B0009NZ738,"Eliseo Subela built a very schocking script around a supposed alien that suddenly in a Hospital for insanes in Bueno Aires.

His presence brings about curiosity around the Doctor who examines him. The first half is really intriguing, but the script lacks its dramatic punch once we capture the message in the bottle.

Good but not great film that nevertheless deserves your attention.",1311033600,,384,5.079365079365079
8064083,5,B0009NZ738,"How wonderful this rare treat is actually on DVD. Does this DVD version have subtitles?  I don't see any mention of that in the specifications.  I recently acquired the laserdisc version (rare!) with subtitles.  It was certainly better than the VHS version, but something tells me the original film quality was not all that great either.  But who knows, it is all about the transfer process these days regarding the final quality.",1278892800,5,430,4.930555555555555
8064084,5,B0009NZ738,"A movie like no other. Subiela made a excellent job with Hugo Soto. The whole idea is intersting and perturbating also. How could human know for sure the diference between reason and insanity?. Why do some people act in such way while other think and conduct beyond the rule?
An apasionate story about social boundaries  and the importance the little things in our lifes.",1243987200,2,371,4.796875
8064085,5,B0009NZ738,"Is it possible? Is this just fantasy? Who really knows about the limits of the human mind. If you believe that there's ""something else"" about ourselves, about us... watch this movie: there are no answers, it can't be. Zen buddhism says you can not understand the mind between the mind, but you'll be glad to smell ""other realms"" with ""Hombre mirando al sudeste"", it's other reality. This movie is like a koan that blows your mind.",1183161600,6,430,4.671052631578948
