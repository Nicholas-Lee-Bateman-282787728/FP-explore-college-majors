First of all, it is put out by Sinister Cinema, and I have had problems with the quality of their DVDs - no attempt at re-mastering here. Secondly, it was a 300 minute serial which was put out in the 'old days' in installments with cliff-hangers so that movie theater-goers would come back each week for the next installment. So this, at 70 minutes? - no wonder it doesn't make any sense. Thirdly, the good guys and the bad guys all look alike (suits, ties, hats), so  you don't know who you are rooting for - everyone wears a suit, hat and tie. And it is so dark in most scenes, probably so you won't know they are using  the same sets over and over. I couldn't wait for it to end and more fool me for not just shutting it off. Alpha is selling a DVD of this, also at 70 minutes, and I never thought I'd recommend Alpha! But I guess no matter how bad it is, it can always get worse.",1421366400,,969,4.015544041450777
