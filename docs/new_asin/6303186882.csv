7840504,5,6303186882,Tom Selleck is great in all he does.  I watched Magnum then and I love to watch it now.,1412726400,,87,3.5789473684210527
7840505,5,6303186882,"Magnum is my absolute favorite series  and when you see the first episode you'll know why he and the cast were so popular and still are to many of us.  I loved how he introduced us to who he was , where he came from.
  we  hear him say ""Ive done funnier"" rub his shoulder you see a bullet wound then flashbacks intro us to Rick as a gunner and TC as a pilot in Nam (Steve Kux  was a real Nam pilot responsible for all those cool shots over the opening theme hard to get but hes great and did it)
 It had funny moments""Dont look at the dogs work the lock , don't look at the.."" then he looks(apollo and zeus(Higgins dobermans) coming toward him) ""you looked at the dogs"" he was hired to see if he could breach security including steal the Ferrari.  Youll see early Magnum trademarks that slow building temper esp. when he went to  confront a hardnose officer who didn't like him. ""youre gonna lose those bars you spent 30 years eggsucking for"" (Magnum growls)important cause you'll see that temper again and again when Magnum feels he was wronged. It became a trademark the slow burn  warn tone then boom he was off..and on your case.
 He had very memorable music ""the brazilian "" in Unfinished business"" and Mama in ""Death and Taxes"" you gotta see those two too!
  Nobody had a cast like them they got along great couldn't be better friends..highly reccommend it for people who love suspense this is it!! youll be hooked..Mahalo (Thanks!!)",1068508800,,1439,4.425855513307985
7840506,5,6303186882,"Magnum PI is one of the best shows on TV ever, and I really enjoyed seeing this premier episode. If you have seen the later episodes, you can see the chemistry between the casts - they are great together. In this first episode, the characters are still very ""unpolished"", and you would probably have difficult to recognize the different characters if you just have seen episodes from the last seasons. For example, Rick is some kind of Bogart-look-a-like that has some kind of Casablanca-club in Honolulu...nothing like King Kamehamea Club at all. Higgins are pretty much the same, even if I miss his great stories in this 1,5 hours episode. However, this is a great production, and if you were interested in seeing a film about great adventures, Hawaii, Ferrari, Friendship, and the start of one of the most successful TV shows ever, I would recommend you to see this very first Magnum PI episode.",1016064000,4,898,4.8
7840507,5,6303186882,"The Best series ever and yet no movie?  Not many have seen the first episode.  It's a bit strange after seeing the later ones, only because it was more serious, not as much comedy.  There needs to be a push to wake  Universal up ... this should have hit the silver screen Years ago!  Make  DVD's and a Movie!",960854400,9,308,4.135593220338983
7840508,5,6303186882,"This is the first episode of a tremendous series that dominated the 1980's starring Tom Selleck as Thomas Sullivan Magnum, an ex' naval officer turned private investigator. The beginning of this episode features the hillarious  round one of an ongoing confrontation between Magnum and his frequent  nemesis, Jonathan Quail Higgins, who is the major domo of the Robin  Masters' estate in Hawaii. This episode artfully combines humor and drama  to present an outstanding harbinger of the show that ran for eight years.  Highly recommended.",946425600,19,537,5.345238095238095
7840509,3,6303186882,"If you are a Magnum, P.I. devotee, you need to see this pilot of the series.  What is interesting is to see how stiff the acting is in this first episode.  Naturally, the actors have not fully developed their  characters, so they are not the familiar ""friends"" you may have  related to as the series and characters later developed.  The scenes move  slowly, but what is gratifying is to see how this awkward, ugly duckling of  an episode transformed itself into a top notch swan of a great and  entertaining TV series.  You won't even recognize that familiar Magnum  theme -  that came much later. The writing is excellent, having been done  by the series' co-creators, Donald A. Bellasario and Glen A. Larson.  See  this episode and you'll appreciate how creators, writers, directors and  actors improve their skills to develop a great TV series with talent and  craft.  Enjoy!",942192000,,878,4.785234899328859
7840510,5,6303186882,"Magnum hasn't lost any appeal as the years have gone by.  I'd love to see the episodes available on DVD, I'd buy them all!",940723200,3,122,4.083333333333333
7840511,5,6303186882,This pilot that started the Magnum PI TV series is one of the most exciting 1 1/2 hours that has ever been made for TV.  This movie includes all the cast regulars that played into the show's 8 1/2 years of success.  The first ten minute scene might be one of the best in TV history! If you  are the slightest Magnum PI fan this is well worth the price!,922060800,5,352,4.0
