8358606,4,B0029Z8KE2,a good pack though you can tell that they were non English films to begin with but still enjoyable.,1490486400,,99,4.2631578947368425
8358607,3,B0029Z8KE2,"I give this a 3 because of the tree movies. All three are worth the watch, not the money you have to pay to see them.
Wicked lake has gore, naked lesbians, great sound track. it sounds better then it really is. its slow.
werewolf woman has No gore, not much wolf action. the girl is some what pretty. you get to see her nude in the wolf get up that has large dark nipples. sounds better then it is. its slow.
flesh for the beast has nudity and gore, a hot chick with black eyes. sounds better then it is.
all the movies are worth watching but not to buy. try to see them for free. its slow.
not that i don't like slow movies. these ones just don't have what im looking for.",1475107200,,673,3.9925925925925925
8358608,2,B0029Z8KE2,"The Werewolf Woman was great, the other films were gawd awful, they were not the ones stated at Amazon. Was disappointed the Nightmares Come at Night wasn't in the set as described. The rest of the films were horrible shot on video disasters, nothing worth mentioning.",1439769600,2,268,4.8478260869565215
8358609,5,B0029Z8KE2,"My set of three movies had the movie ""Wicked Lake"" instead of Nightmares.  Nightmares is a MUCH BETTER movie.  The only film work watching is Werewolf Woman, which DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.  Werewolf woman alone is worth the price.",1378252800,2,226,4.894736842105263
