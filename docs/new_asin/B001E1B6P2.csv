3545205,1,B001E1B6P2,I have waited a long time for this to come out on Dvd and now that I have it can't wait to give it away. Is this suppose to be mellow dramatic camp.  It's a horrid little pill.  One star for great cast. I'm sorry Fassbender even though you were good (the reason I wanted this was for you) a great cast does not a movie make.

3545206,3,B001E1B6P2,"This was released in 2007, which was when I managed to snag a copy, but despite the gap of three years, I distinctly recall how wonderful this film was to look at and how boring it was to watch. The luminous and criminally underrated Romola Garai portrays the title character, which I'm told Elizabeth Taylor (the author) based upon the mega-best-selling Edwardian era author, Marie Corelli. The temperamental and charismatic Corelli had a rags-to-riches climb to become the 1900s equivalent of Nora Roberts and Dan Brown, and Angel Deverell's personality and path to success follows this trajectory. Though the film is glorious in color and pizzaz (some of the gowns worn by Garai are absolutely stunning, and the DVD cover highlights one of the more visually appealing scenes in the movie), the movie is aggravating. Angel Deverell is a thoroughly unlikeable character, but the script never gives us a reason to care for her, or even to understand her unpleasantness. Equally odd is Esm (Michael Fassbender), a spoiled and brooding man whose experiences in WWI make him more repelling than compelling. However, taken as a whole, rather than in bits and pieces, the film is both fascinating and disturbing, and Angel is grasping, egotistical, self-assured, and talented, and her forcing of the world to be a crazy, self-invented fairy tale is addictive. The film is very far from perfect, and the ending is abrupt and baffling, but it is an unforgettable experience.",1291852800,26,1467,5.066115702479339
3545207,4,B001E1B6P2,"G.K. Chesterton once said that, ""A good novel tells us the truth about its hero; but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author.""

He could have been talking about Angel Deverill, the sentimental young novelist in the middle of ""Angel."" This colorful, lush little movie is based&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/on-a-novel/dp/1844085694/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">on a novel</a>&nbsp;by Elizabeth Taylor (no, not THAT Elizabeth Taylor), and Romola Garai brilliantly brings to life a protagonist who is swamped by her own imagination... until reality intrudes.

As a teenage girl in a dumpy little town, Angel Deverill (Garai) dreamed of becoming a famous, wealthy authoress. In time her sentimental, dramatic novels become huge bestsellers, and soon Angel is living the life she's always dreamed of -- a vast mansion, a luxurious life, and a neverending spring of melodramatic ideas.

Soon her real life becomes almost as dramatic as her fantasy life, especially when she falls in love with an impoverished painter named Esme (Michael Fassbender). But when Angel is confronted by death, marriage, war and the loss of her loved ones, she discovers that a dramatic life can also be the worst kind....

Rich ballrooms, sumptuous mansions, dramatic confessions of love, and endless swathes of gold, velvet and marble -- ""Angel"" is a luscious playground for the senses. For the first half, it seems like Angel is living out one of her own novels, but gradually a darker tone starts to creep into the story (such as when Esme tries to rape Angel).

And Franois Ozon has fun with the more ironic moments, mainly by pushing them over the top -- Angel and Esme's first kiss is set in a rainstorm, against a sunset AND with a rainbow overhead, and Angel greets Nora while posing in front of a harp in a flowing bright-pink gown. It's both amusing and heartbreaking to see Angel building up an iridescent bubble of make-believe to live in, only to have it popped by the real world.

Angel is not a heroine, really -- it doesn't take long for us to find out she's immature, selfish and insensitive, and a compulsive liar who constantly embroiders her mundane past. So it's a credit to Garai's talent that she actually makes us like Angel most of the time, putting her limpid eyes and trembly mouth to perfect use. And as her life falls apart, it's painful to see this child-woman being hammered by reality until she shatters.

Fassbender is as excellent but much darker, as we see the moody Esme moving from an edgy young painter into a self-destructive shell of his former self. And Lucy Russell has a good role as the devoted fan who gets to work for her favorite author, only to be subsumed into her life.

""Angel"" is a tragic, dramatic, irony-soaked little story with a clueless anti-heroine -- but for Romola Garai's finest role, definitely a must-see.",1287878400,111,2892,5.010416666666667

3545240,3,B001E1B6P2,"There are definitely comparisons between this film and ""Gone with the Wind"" -- just like Scarlett O'Hara, I feel like Angel Deverell (played by Romola Garai) got what she deserved. Her story begins innocently enough - a rude, spoiled, inconsiderate schoolgirl who dreams and writes (Una Stubbs - from BBC's Sherlock - has a small role as Angel's teacher) and eventually rockets her way to money, success, and stardom. Angel buys her dream house, marries the man she loves (played by Michael Fassbender - Rochester in 2011's Jane Eyre), but as war looms on the horizon Angel's life begins to unravel. Her writing takes a depressing turn and she begins to take on a ghostly, pale, witchlike appearance as she holes herself up in her mansion with her dog, her numerous cats, and her sister-in-law.

There is some nudity in this movie, but my major fault with it is that I don't know exactly what this film was trying to portray. Sadness and depression throughout, but I did love Sam Neill's (with a mustache!) performance as Angel's publisher ... who also may or may not be in love with her. Sam Neill is always great in every role I've seen him in.

I also thought that somewhere toward the middle and ending the movie began feeling slow and drawn-out, but I still felt compelled to keep watching and see what happened to Angel and the people surrounding her. The scenery and costumes (especially Angel's gowns) were simply stunning.

I had previously seen Romola Garai in Atonement and I Capture the Castle (the latter I really, really like), and here she played ""drama queen"" Angel effortlessly. At times (well, most of the time) Angel was spoiled, stubborn, dramatic, and despondent. This movie, however, was much too sad and depressing for my liking - and except for Sam Neill, I wouldn't recommend this film.",1389398400,2,1811,4.798076923076923

3545245,3,B001E1B6P2,"First, let me say I absolutely love Romola Garai ,she is a very talented actress and a joy to watch. And Micheal Fassbender is excellant in every role he takes but, I wanted to like this movie ,I really did ,it looked like a serious drama to me. I had a very open mind toward it and gave it a chance but, I thought I was watching a bad episode of a victorian soap opera. I didn't know if I was watching a broad satire/parody? of a masterpiece theatre story. 40 minutes into this I couldn't believe that there was no character development;I couldn't have cared less about any of the people I was watching. There was no depth to the characters notably Angel played by Romal Garai. And I thought it was  rather insipid with over the top dialoge. I don't blame any of the actors for this ,all of them excellant ,and held up the story as best they could but their talent was wasted because of the screenplay. This story really could have been something if the writing had been better. It was disapointing,alas the only redeeming quality's are the beautiful costumes and cinemtograpghy.  If you are a fan of Romola Garai and Micheal Fassbender they are excellant as always ,it is worth to check this out if curious,but I wouldn't buy it, rent it.........",1354320000,4,1248,4.469298245614035
3545246,4,B001E1B6P2,"First off, I have yet to read the book. After watching this movie, I went and purchased the book. After reading it, I'll come back to this review to edit it. I wonder what scenes they left out?

Angel is an imaginative teenager living in Victorian England. All she wants to do is sell her novel to a publisher and leave her mother's apartment above the grocery. In between writing, she imagines herself living in Paradise House, a beautiful mansion in town. Ignoring her mother, and the taunts of her teacher, she submits her manuscript to a publisher in London. Later, she receives a reply. He wants to meet her. Angel arrives in London and after refusing to alter her romantic novel in any way, the man agrees to publish it. What follows next is a series of semi-erotic novels that catapult Angel from rags-to-riches. She leaves her mother's grocery apartment and moves in Paradise House. Along the way, she falls in love with a struggling painter and learns that her biggest enemy is in fact herself.

I really enjoyed this movie. Like I said, I have yet to read the book. But, when I do, I'll come back and edit this review. What I hated about the movie is the poor cinematography! When Angel is visiting her publisher in London they go for a carriage ride around town, and you can see just how bad the cinematography really is. I think a film student on a tight budget could have done better!

Besides that, I really enjoyed this film. Yes, Angel is a spoiled, immature, brat, but I really liked her character.",1345852800,2,1515,4.542124542124542
3545247,2,B001E1B6P2,The first half of the movie I was looking for Red Skelton the last half I expected Vincent Price to show up. Angel herself makes Scarlet O'Hara look like Mother Teresa. Just did not enjoy it at all because I couldn't take it seriously. Rent Persuasion instead- that movie doesn't have identity issues.,1343001600,3,301,4.69811320754717
3545258,4,B001E1B6P2,"This film is brilliant. A modern day Gone with the Wind.  Same kitsch, snappy dialogue, melodrama...... how could you resist?
Approach it light-heartedly and you will fall in love.",1340668800,3,180,5.206896551724138
3545259,5,B001E1B6P2,"With a cast like the one assembled in ""Angel"", the film could hardly miss, even though its title character is not terribly likable. As she always does, Garai grabs the camera and doesn't let go. One sees too little of Charlotte Rampling but then her part is not core to the story. The costumes and sets do not disappoint, and lovers of gothic tales should enjoy this piece.",1337472000,3,373,4.5
3545260,3,B001E1B6P2,"Although Garai is a very fair actress , her character , Angel, is unbereable:selfish, spoiled, egocentric , mean to her relatives and totally desatached from the reality of life. Actually, she's kind of insane.  People , around her , tend to be her puppets. Angel does not see them as individuals, but characters of her books.

This is one of the problems with the first half hour of the movie: you can't like Angel. You can't be glad for her sucess , fame or recognition. She is detestable and presumptuos. And then she meets Esm, played by Michael Fassbender. Everything changes.

It's easy to see when an actor has charisma simply because the film starts from that point on. Even the hateful Angel begins to get  a little bit more interesting from that point on and the plot, poorly written, also begins to make some sense from that point on. Step by step, the film stops graviting around Angel and starts graviting around Esm. Well, not Esm, but Michael Fassbender himself.

When Esm grows up, Angel is forced to grow up too. It's fascinating to observe Michael Fassbender's transformation from a trifling charmer to a revolted and emasculated man. His sensitive and sensual performance is the only (but powerful)reason this flick is worthwhile being seen.",1334361600,7,1260,4.841860465116279
3545261,2,B001E1B6P2,"Elizabeth Taylor's ANGEL is a writer's novel, much beloved by other novelists because of its tricky premise. At the turn of the century, in a small manufacturing town, Angel Deverell, the grocer's daughter, is convinced of her own genius as a novelist (the fact that she doesn't enjoy other people's novels does not seem in any way a setback to her). Contemptuous of her aunt's service as a maid at a local estate, Angel dreams of one day having enough money to buy the manor home herself... and through sheer determination, plus her dogged belief in her own romantic fantasies (which sell novels in the hundreds of thousands), she is successful. She also buys the handsomest man she meets, and enthralls his sister as her private secretary. And then everything falls apart.

The biggest mistake that the French film director Francois Ozon made in making this novel into a film was to cast Romola Garai in the central role, and insisted she bring her loopier and endearing qualities to the part. Probably he imagined that was the only way to the put the exceptionally unlikeable Angel over to film audiences, but it in effect guts the story: the fascination of Taylor's novel is to see this fierce and frightening eagle get everything she wants, and Garai can only play her as a silly goose. It's impossible to imagine her Angel intimidating everyone in her town and staring down wealthy London publishers: Garai seems like a complete pushover. She's terrific in her later scenes (when the aging Angel becomes something of a haunted guy of a woman in her huge picture hats and feathers), but there's no edge to her Angel whatsoever in the crucial early scenes, and Ozon makes things worse for her by filming everything in her town as lovely and snowy and supplying a nostalgic Masterpiece Theatre score. There's excellent supporting work from Sam O'Neill as her publisher, Charlotte Rampling as his wife, Michael Fassbender (in one of the first film roles to get him noticed) as Angel's caddish and tormented husband, and hard-faced Lucy Russell as Angel's dogged girl Friday. But this isn't enough to fully redeem the central miscasting, or to make the film seem like it has enough reason for existing.",1326240000,6,2203,4.85904255319149
3545262,5,B001E1B6P2,"Being a fan of Michael Fassbender is what brought me to this movie.  You can feel the emotions along with Angel as we follow her life and adventures.  The colors are vivid, the scenery a bit cheesy at times, but it is all part of Angel's fairytale life.  This movie is a good escape and it is easy to get wrapped up in Angel's success and love for Esme.",1317600000,6,353,4.086956521739131
3545263,3,B001E1B6P2,The film is predictable but well acted and the cinematography is superb. But it is the music that is really good. The musical score is worth watching the movie. I strongly recommend the score for those who like movie music.,1315267200,2,223,4.6
3545264,4,B001E1B6P2,"This film was recommended to me by a friend, and I found it quite interesting.  As an author myself, having had times of building my own make-believe worlds to shut out the pain of reality, I totally understood the driving force behind Angel's need to rewrite her life in order to survive it.  Creativity sometimes borders on a type of madness, but it's difficult to understand unless you've been pushed to the edge.

It's obvious Angel had deep emotional problems.  Her way of coping with these emotions was fantasy.  She fell in love with the idea of love with a man she fantasized about, but it was the reality of the painful truth that was her undoing in the end.  Though the beginning is filled with what I call ""fluff"" of Angel's rise in popularity as a writer, the starkness of her dark life in the end was a great contrast.  She loved her husband like the characters in her books loved their heros - blindly and with a tad of selfish obsessive possessiveness.

Ironically, the home she dreamed about her entire life, Paradise, became the very thing that stole her happiness from her.  Not exactly the Paradise she had dreamed of as a child.  Even when your dreams are often achieved, rather than a silver lining, it turns out to be a black cloud.

The the costumes and indoor settings are stunning, but there is poor cinematography in scenes that distract somewhat from the story cheapening the film.

All in all, I enjoy it.  I'm more of the drama tragic type anyway.",1301097600,3,1476,4.566539923954372
3545265,1,B001E1B6P2,"I'm glad this was only a rental and I didn't actually purchase the DVD. I love Romola Garai.

I'm surprised by how awful this film is.  The story is ridiculous (no offense to the author -- I haven't read the book), the acting's WAY over the top, and the filmmaking and camera effects are astonishingly horrible (lost track of the number of fake backgrounds).

So many other great actresses could have made this a fantastic film opposite him. The only comment I have about him is that he was wearing a wristwatch in one of the early scenes as well as in a photo on the back of the movie box. As the movie takes place in 1905, I did some research to discover that men did not start tying their pocket watches onto their wrists until at least 1918 and did not have the kind of watch band he had until the 1930's.",1487721600,2,742,4.225352112676056
