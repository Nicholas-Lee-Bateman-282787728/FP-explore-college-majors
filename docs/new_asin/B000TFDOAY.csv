You have GOT to be joking.  This is the worst film ever created in the history of time, space, mammals, human interaction, sight and sound.  Watching it was like an April Fool's Day joke...on myself.

WORST ACTING.  Trust me, you'll know what I mean, in the first 5 minutes.

So bad, it's funny.  I should have known by the cover art.",1283731200,3,349,4.444444444444445
8325736,5,B000TFDOAY,"Few films combine a dense and tingling atmosphere with the headlong pacing and adventure of Born Into Mafia.

You sit there, and the action assaults you, and using words to re-create it would be futile. What actually happens to the character Ivan is essentially immaterial. What matters is that SOMETHING must happen, so he can run away from it or toward it.

A great action movie, exhilarating and neatly crafted, the kind of picture that will still look good 20 or 30 years from now.",1187222400,,485,4.694117647058824
8325737,5,B000TFDOAY,"I love mafia movies like The Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco and so on and I purchased this to give it a try. I was surprised of how much I enjoyed this film. Full of action and turn arrounds. Amazing!! I would definately recommend it. You will love it.",1184544000,2,266,4.448979591836735
