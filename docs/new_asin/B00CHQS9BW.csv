8581845,1,B00CHQS9BW,"This is a deliberately camp movie, filmed in Spain. Lotus Cat Foods moves to Spain and Grizzly has a secret ingredient that cats really love. Of course if a fifth grader was writing the plot they would become addicted to human meat and be able to take down a human like a lion.

Worst film by far in the ""trilogy.""

Guide: No swearing or nudity. Brief sex scene.  Worth a punch on the hacker's card.",1472342400,,399,4.293333333333333

8581847,1,B00CHQS9BW,"I am a person who has seen and owned many bad movies, but this one is by far the worst I have seen lately.  First of all it was made in Spain.  You can tell the actors(if that's what you call them) do not speak English as their primary language or it was bad dubbing.  The lines were hard to understand.  Most of the time I asked myself ""What did  (s)he say""?  The not so special effects were so phony.  Nothing like people throwing around stuffed animals.  Even the dissolve scenes were worse than the first movie.  At least I could undstand that one.  I was never so glad to finish a movie since well EVER.  My fellow cheese fans: BEWARE!",1378252800,,640,4.206611570247934
