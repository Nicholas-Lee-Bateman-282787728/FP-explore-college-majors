7945201,3,B00005MEUV,"The fourth DVD volume of the Robotech series contains six excellent episodes featuring the first attempts at peace between the Earth Defense Forces (anchored by the SDF-1) and the alien Zentradi, including the eyecatches to and from commercial breaks. In the late 1980s, F.H.E. had released a videotape of these same episodes edited together to form one ""movie;"" while that was okay, this presentation by ADV Films is far superior, allowing easy access to any particular episode on may wish to view.
This is one of my favorite anime series. However, I can only rate this DVD as a ""3"" for two reasons. First, concerning the DVD construction, the main menu begins with a brief clip from the series without any actual menu selections immediately available, which can cause confusion for some users; also, this is the exact same clip used for the main menu in the third DVD of the Robotech series - at least this should have been changed during DVD construction. Secondly, and by far the most significant flaw, this DVD is NOT compatible with the PlayStation2, whereas the first DVD in the series worked perfectly with the PS2.",1012176000,3,1123,4.854166666666667
7945202,5,B00005MEUV,"Robotech &#8211; The Macross Saga 4:  Battlefront, contains episodes 19 through 24 of the legendary anime series from the mid 1980s.
For the uninitiated, Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s (along with Star Blazers, Voltron, Transor Z,  etc.)  Known for its cutting edge animation, high tech battle scenes, futuristic weapons (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
Set in the 21st century, Robotech's sweeping saga spanned three seasons and weaved together three actual separate Japanese anime series:  Season 1- The Macross Saga, Season 2 - The Robotech Masters (The Southern Cross in Japan), and Season 3 - The New Generation (Mospeada in Japan).  The basic story premise is that the earth became forever changed when a mysterious alien battleship crashed on earth.  The people of the world, now knowing that they are not alone in the universe, end all wars and unite to understand and assimilate the advanced technology and prepare for the inevitable alien invasion that is sure to come.  As the story unfolds mankind would go on to battle three separate alien races over the next three seasons.  The sweeping intergalactic war saga itself though, merely becomes the backdrop of a more deeper &#8220;human&#8221; saga.
This volume chronicles adventures from the first season &#8211; The Macross Saga.  In this volume the story is off at full steam with TONS of INTENSE ACTION and intense loss as the enemy attacks relentlessly.  Also at full speed is the equally intense soap opera love triangle between Rick, Lisa, Minmei and Kyle.  Here are the episodes featured on this DVD:
Episode 19 &#8211; Bursting Point:  With the loss of Roy Fokker, a new Skull Leader emerges just in time for another cataclysmic battle with the Zentraedi.  The plan to unload the civilian refugees goes awry as for the second episode in a row, tragedy strikes again... Also, Miriam plans for revenge and Kyle calls for peace.
Episdoe 20 &#8211; Paradise Lost:  Rick copes with the strains of leadership.  Dolza restores Breetai to power.  The spies return home sharing and reflecting on their life changing earth experience.  Also, BANISHED &#8211; the SD-F1 without a home!
Episode 21 &#8211; A New Dawn:  Rick and Lisa bond while trapped in a section of the SD-F1 during an attack.  Minmei and Kyle make their big screen debut (with EVERYONE tuned in)!  Plus, Miriam continues her search for her nemesis...
Episode 22 &#8211; Battle Hymn:  Macross City invaded!  Plus, Minmei's music FOREVER changes the Zentraedi empire...
Episode 23 &#8211; Reckless:  Desertion in the Zentraedi ranks!  Plus, more fighting and more soap opera escapades with our four star-crossed lovers...
Episode 24 &#8211; Showdown:  Lisa returns to Earth to lobby for peace in light of the events in the last episode, IF she can get past enemy lines to make it...  Miriam gets her rematch with Max, at the arcade!  Plus, Rick confesses something to Lisa!
Incidentally, these volumes DO NOT have special DVD features (aside from trailer ads for other anime series coming out on DVD from ADV).  While on its own this may be considered a crime, not to fear.  If you purchase the boxed set collections, each boxed set collection will come with an &#8220;Extra:  Elements of Robotechnology&#8221; DVD special which will contain all the DVD special features you could want on DVD:  interviews, trailers, commercial spots, specs, etc... So by all means, get the boxed set if you are planning on buying.
I am personally very happy that ADV and Harmony Gold have finally released this series on DVD.  This is BY FAR one of my favorite cartoons from childhood.  If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture hit.  It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US.  If you did grew up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  They're great for a trip down memory lane.  Honestly, watching these episodes now I can honestly say that they are better than I remember.  You can't lose!

7945203,5,B00005MEUV,"As the citizens of the SDF-1 are ordered to stay on the ship and take off once again for space, the crew goes through some remarkable changes. Here are the following episodes.
Bursting Point: Just when the citizens get a break, Kyron attacks in full force on the SDF-1 Omni-Barrier. And another crew member will lose his life.
Paradise Lost: The SDF-1 is ordered off Earth, but Minmei makes a cheer-up speech to the Macross citizens.
A New Dawn: When Minmei's new movie premieres, the SDF-1 goes into an unprepared transformation. This leaves Rick and Lisa trapped in a part of the ship.
Battle Hymn: While the SDF-1's Dataless attack is foiled by Kyron's troop, some of them defect when they make it in there. And Minmei continues to sing while the battle rages on inside.
Reckless: After seeing Minmei and Lynn Kyle kiss, Rick continues to fight, angry. Meanwhile, Kyron's soldiers begin to dessert him in the battle on the ship.
Showdown: While Lisa leaves the SDF-1 for peace negotiations on Earth with the Zentradi defectors, Max challenges Miryal and then asks her on a date.
The battles on this disc are pretty great, but the majority of the episodes here are character development episodes. There is one thing worth nothing. When Max and Rick go into the arcade, theres a video game of Lupin 3. Anyway, another great disc that gives you a crave for Volume 5. It's only about a month until the next set comes out, but I can't wait that long!",997228800,,1448,4.66015625
