8173533,5,B00000JHP8,"I have a VHS-to-DVD transfer of this but the tape was old so the pic is kinda shot. The sound is good though. It lasts only 40' but the dvd edition could be nicely rounded up by festival appearances, videoclips, bio, interviews, photo galleries, screensavers/wallpapers and the like. The concert absolutely ROCKS with the former singer; it gives the tracks a totally different feel so download this while the official dvd comes out.",1303257600,,432,4.931506849315069
