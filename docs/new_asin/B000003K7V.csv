7902693,5,B000003K7V,"An incredible episode with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at. Also filled with very good acting from Andrew Robinson and Rene Auberjonois. Odo and Garak are taken aboard a Romulan Warbird and taken (with several other warbirds and Cardassian ships) into the Gamma Quadrant. With one mission: to destroy the Founder's home world. When they get there, all is not as it appears. I would recommend this episode to anyone and everyone who likes Deep Space Nine.",1048464000,,474,4.7926829268292686
7902694,4,B000003K7V,"Second-part episodes have the dubious distinction of holding the momentum set forth in the first installment. ""Die"" tries but just isn't as good, although the actors make a valiant effort to keep the story strong. Rene Auberjonois, Andrew Robinson, and Paul Dooley are again brilliant in their respective roles. The special effects crew gets a chance to shine when an all-out Dominion attack surprises the Cardassian-Klingon Alliance.
And the reminder that ""no changeling has ever harmed another"" comes from a surprising source",1047686400,,527,5.439024390243903
7902695,5,B000003K7V,"Episode title: The Die Is Cast
Written by: Ronald D. Moore
Directed by: David Livingston
""The Die Is Cast"" is a direct sequel to the outstanding ""Improbable Cause"" and to all surprise, it manages to live up to it's prequel's standards, even if they diverse tremendously.
After the subtle and dramatic ""Improbable Cause"", ""The Die Is Cast"" offers direct escalation and powerfully and rapidly paced storstructure.
It is, in a way, as dark as it's prequel, but not at all in the way you'd expect. As ""Improbable Cause"" was dark in an anxiously repressed way, ""The Die Is Cast"" throws the pain directly onto the viewer's face.
It's also as slow to open up to the viewer as yo might expect from the earlier episode, but not because it's so subtle, but because it's so out in the open. At first it seems only to be a political action-adventure, but as you watch it more, from analytical perspective, it's one of the most thought-provoking and profound star trek episodes.
So, in the end, it was probably a good thing this two episode long story was divided into two different parts, with two very different writers, and two very different directors.
I never would have thought the infamous third season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine could produce such a masterpiece of drama and talent.",1013731200,,1280,4.71875
7902696,5,B000003K7V,"Spoiler Alert!
Tain is Garak's father.  I was shocked to learn that the leader of the Obsidian Order was our favorite talor's dad.  We don't know at this point weather or not he's a stepfather or his biological parent.  It was horrifying to watch Odo being tortured by the Cardassian talor.  The episode left lots of questions.  How did Garak become so trecherous and evil? It part of the politcal climate of his planet. However, it did not excuse him and what he inflicted on Odo.
A lot of the episode takes place aboard a Romulan starship.  It was refreshing to see the viewpoint of an Romulan commander who turned out to be part of the Dominion.",976752000,2,648,4.495726495726496
7902697,5,B000003K7V,"The great season three of Deep Space Nine is coming to a close with only a handful of episodes left, this action packed outing is worth every penny.  Garak is interrogating Odo by using a Romulan device that prevents him from  returning to liquid form, something that soon becomes torture as Odo's body  desperately needs regeneration. In the meantime the Federation gets wind of  the Romulan-Cardassian plot to enter the Gamma Quadrant and attack the  Founder's homeworld, striking a deadly blow to the evil Dominion! Great  battle sequences make this one an intelligent story with a classic  ending...",966643200,,603,5.091836734693878
7902698,5,B000003K7V,"DS9 heads know that towards the end of the series, the Cardassians forge alliance with the Dominion thus gaining a foothold in the Alpha Quadrant. It is particularly interesting that the Dominion would wipe out any  opposition within Cardassian Government before attempting to make this  alliance/occupation.  In this episode, the Cardi's and the Romulans  Intelligence operatives join forces to attack the Dominion homeworld before  they ever have a chance to come into the Alpha Quad.  Though it may not  have been intentional, this story intertwines with future episodes  contributing to the masterpieces of DS9. (if you like Garek, you'll love  this episode)  NOTE- not all episodes are good, in fact some are painful  and even hideous. The end of the show was ruined with a buildup to nothing-  (the dominion simply gave up). I suspect that the show expected a movie and  at the last minute the cranks at Paramount decided against it.",953510400,,939,5.0588235294117645

7902700,5,B000003K7V,"If you love the enigmatic tailor of Deep Space Nine then this is the best Garak episode yet. ""The Die is Cast"" along with its partner video ""Improbable Cause"" finally shed light on Garak's past on  Cardassia and in the Obsidian Order. Garak is offered the opportunity to  return to Cardassia, but must torture Odo in order to prove his loyalty. He  begins to realize that he has changed since living among the federation on  Deep Space Nine. He is divided between his desire to return home and his  reluctance to harm Odo during interrogation. Meanwhile the Obsidian Order  and Romulan Tal-Shiar are preparing an invasion on the Founder home world  that could pull everyone into war.",953251200,,683,4.786324786324786
7902701,4,B000003K7V,"'The Die is Cast' is the second in a two part DS9 story (""Improbable Cause"" is the first, and basically sets up this episode).  It involves a plot by the Tal-Shiar and the Obsidian Order (kind of like the CIA for  the Romulans and Cardassians) to eliminate the Dominion as a threat. Having  secretly built a large fleet of warships, they embark on a mission to  destroy the homeworld of the Founders, the Dominion's masters.  In tow are  Garak and a very unwilling Odo.  Garak's old mentor wants Odo (a member of  the Founder's race) interegated.  Garak must decide between returning to  the old life he was cast out of, and the life of his friend.  Our heroes on  DS9 must also decide:  Do they try and stop this fleet?  A successful  attack may eliminate the Dominion as a long term threat, but a failed one  could plunge the galaxy into bloody war.  Nice tension, great scenes  between Garak and Odo, a big ending, and a number of plot twists make this  an excellent episode.  Huge events which turn the whole 'Star Trek'  universe on it's ear are what separate DS9 from the other Star Trek series.  This episode is a great example of that grand-scale story telling, yet it  does not lose site of Star Trek's signature character drama.  Lots of fun,  especially when paired with it's partner!",949276800,4,1295,4.550218340611353
7902702,4,B000003K7V,"I really enjoyed ""The Die is Cast"", but I did not enjoy ""The Die is Cast Part II"" only because there is no such episode. The first part of that episode is ""Improbable Cause (Episode 65)""  Also, there is an episode between ""Improbable Cause"" and  ""The Die is Cast"" called ""Through The Looking Glass(Episode  66)."" I do not mean to offend anyone, but, you need to write the right  things on your website if you ask me.",945820800,5,416,4.363636363636363
