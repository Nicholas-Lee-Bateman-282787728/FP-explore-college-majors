8441147,5,B004U2BS2S,Kitty was our trainer. She taught us & our head-strong puppy so much. She was a fabulous trainer. Her lessons have lead to a LIFETIME of obedience and companionship. Our dog is turning 12 this year. Everyone always comments on what a good dog she is. Thank you Kitty!,1312502400,,267,4.469387755102041
