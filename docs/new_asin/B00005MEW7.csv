1625535,5,B00005MEW7,"In it's full length version (103 minutes) this is a great movie, full of beautiful scenery, light hearted humor, and a moving drama that will take you out of your living room and on to a white water trip you won't forget. Clean language, no sexual innuendos and a family theme throughout-what more could you ask for?  5 stars!!",1243468800,2,327,4.5423728813559325

This is a touching story, nicely told with beautiful scenery and lots of light hearted humor.  It's nice to enjoy the ride without all the usual Hollywood type garbage.  Highly recommended for family viewing.",1153440000,7,294,4.938775510204081
1625538,1,B00005MEW7,"I recieved the Cut version - 85 minutes vs. the original which is 103 minutes.  The original is unforgettable, stunning scenery, fabulous whitewater, great stories.  The cut version is sloppy, has no transitions between scenes, is a discredit to the original director.  There is no swearing or ""adult scenarios"" in the original.  I don't understand the need to ruin a wonderful movie in this way.",1127088000,8,396,5.046153846153846

1625546,5,B00005MEW7,"Excellent for river lovers, rafters and people wanting their families to see the world outside the computer and tv screens.  Not a bunch of (if any) swearing, sex or violence.  It has several threads involving integrity and honesty and especially forgiveness and courage.  Your kids will watch it many times.  ""Wind in your hair puts wind in your sails"".

1625548,5,B00005MEW7,"I loved this movie!

You can't beat the prices on used DVD's here on Amazon either their great!

Well our family loves the ""Feature Film For Families"" Dvd's because of the quality. Everyone can watch and enjoy and not worry about something popping up that wouldn't be age appropriate.

The parents guide on the back of the DVD case is wonderful we go through it after the movie it just wraps up our family time perfectly.

Now about the movie:

Same River Twice

As Kramer and his old river running buddies make their way down the breathtaking and dangerous Salmon River, they discover that there is more under the surface of each other's lives than meets the eye. What follows reveals the healing power of friendship as they face new challenges together.",1263427200,2,755,4.681818181818182

7945419,5,B00005MEW7,"Most awesome movie!  A little known secret classic. Saw it one very late evening, but couldn't catch the name, so I had a very difficult time finding it, searched for years!  Bought it immediately when I found it!  It's funny, insightful, encouraging, passionate, poetic, and poignant. The scenery is breathtaking, the production puts you on & in the river, could almost feel the water on my face!  A great adventure & action flick - for men there's competition (not always friendly), friendship, pranks, physical endurance, strength & wisdom.  For the ladies, humor, relationships, etc.  No religion, traditions or rituals, just everyday life & how different people deal with it's ups & downs, it's joy & tears - and become stronger and better, not only for themselves but all who may encounter them.  This is a must have movie for the family - no sex, no violence, no vulgar language - not even cursing!  how refreshing!",1510099200,,922,4.903225806451613
