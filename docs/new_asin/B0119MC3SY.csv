8723879,4,B0119MC3SY,"Though Ive gotten bored with most scripted dramas on TV, finding them a predictable reworking of older stories or shows, Dark Matter became a must see for my wife and I for season 1.  The show has a lot of clichs, but for the first season had some good chemistry and plot twists.
The crew waking up from hibernation in a damaged, highly armed small freighter, with no memories (except for useful skills as with most amnesia in fiction), except for one teen girl who had acquired scrambled copies of everyone elses memories.  Initially with no memories of their names, they refer to each other by the order they woke up.  (The man who woke up first is 1 the woman who woke up second is 2 etc.)  Then they find they were brutal criminal mercenaries, on route to wipe out a mining colony (to the last man woman and child), so their client could claim the planet on the cheap as abandoned property.  Revolted by who they were they keep their numbers as names, and set out to become better people, get out of life, etc  while not being killed by ex-enemies or clients.  All while trying to unravel various mysteries about themselves and the situation and universe they find themselves in.  All mixed in with plot twists leaving clues for later eps plots, and good plot hooks making for a very watchable show.

Critical in the first seasons success is the character chemistry and development. The main character and captain 2 being a main example.  Initially assuring the others she will find a way out of this for them, she must decide herself if she wants to go straight, open up and embrace the affection she has for the teen girl 5 she feels like a sister to, and the continuously loyal and supportive (almost regardless of the cost to himself) man 1 she falls in love with.  Or following 3s advice and just go back to more like what she was, and the group staying criminals and mercenaries.  The relationship between 2 and 3 is essentially two junkies, one debating on kicking the stuff and building a real life, the other an enabler telling her things were fine before, why bother.  With a Lets do a couple lines and not worry about it. attitude.  This arc Leeds to a crashing crisis toward seasons end.

Strangely for season 2 all the strengths of season 1 were wittingly or unwittingly deleted.  The show lost over a third of its season 1 audience in season two, and though my wife and I loved season one .. we quickly lost all interest in, and barely watched the last eps of, season 2.",1483056000,,2488,4.483370288248337
8723880,1,B0119MC3SY,None of these discs would play. Checked other DVD's of mine with no problem. Something very wrong with these discs for them not to play.,1458518400,,136,4.48
8723881,5,B0119MC3SY,Great action. Fun space ship show.  It has humor too.  It is not boring.  They have a good story building same as killjoys TV series with good characters.  what I wonder is when is a region 0 or 1 going to be for sale?  I know it has been released in Australia and UK.  But not region 0 or 1 have I found to buy yet.,1458259200,3,316,3.712121212121212
8723882,5,B0119MC3SY,"Despite terrible promo spots this is a great new property by Sy Fi
It's simple but, not
It's a update of the dirty dozen minus half mixed with classic sci-fi elements and throw in a little Memento
The Cast is strong
Roger R. Cross (Six) is a great character actor that always tends to play bad guys (you may have seen him in Continuum, Orphan Black, The Strain) among much more he reminds me of Danny Trejo
He's a Huge reason why i stuck with this!

Zoie Palmer (The Android) better known for Lauren in Lost Girl
(Great Choice with all the Android in the last 35 years on tv and in films) She does good in a way she kind of holds back but, I guess she has to for this role to work!

Jodelle Ferland (Five) She looked so familiar then i looked her up on imdb wow
Carrie (2002) tv movie, which i actually like i know i suck! she was in the dead like me (Pilot)
she played Mary Jensen Kingdom Hospital ,
she played Sharon / Alessa in Silent Hill ,
and she did v/o work as the little sister in Bio Shock II
and she's only 21 that's the work i know her from super talented actress
She's awesome I think they dyed her hair so she didn't look like Melissa O'Neil sister/mother
Most Gamer's/Horror Fans will know her.....

Everyone else i never seen before or i just don't recognize there previous work no matter
they all are very good
Marc Bendavid (One)
Melissa O'Neil (Two)
Anthony Lemke (Three)
Alex Mallari Jr. (Four)

The Six of them wake up with no memories of who they are and you are given small bits of info little by little throughout the first 12 episodes
It might sounds lame on paper it's not it's actually very well written and enjoyable
The cast have to sell a lot of whats going on (There are flash back sequences and different hints)
you learn out of the gate that there a band of wanted Criminals (that are in fact hired guns each one with different back stories) some not who they claim they are
Most of the effects are really good for the Budget (the inside of the ship looks really Organic like the Original Alien Film)
I'd go as far as saying the over all Digital F/X are much better stacked against the final Season of TNT's Falling Skies
a lot of the F/X on Dark Matter look Polished and detailed (not rushed)
Go out of your way and watch at least the first three episodes and get a feel for it
If it's something your enjoy you're know it pretty quick

Hopefully it gets renowned for a second season! The 2-part season finally added more questions then answers
But, it was actually a compelling finally. that was done the right way (with a Twist that was kind of like The Thing) I mean the build up!
with SyFi winding down Lost Girl, Haven, & Continuum
and Helix Getting canceled after only a second season SyFi needs Strong Exclusive Properties
Hopefully Dark Matter can be one of those properties
These is another great example that if you give Sy Fi the ball they will knock it out of the park
this is there 2015 Dominion..... Hopefully more tv viewers give it a real chance and don't count it out on the strange cheap name",1456876800,4,3043,4.285217391304347

8723884,5,B0119MC3SY,"I love the show and I want to have the season on DVD.  It ain't Firefly, but it is something new and decent and a sight better than ANYTHING else SeeFee has produced for the past eight years.  I'm actually surprised THEY were the channel to produce it.  There are only thirteen episodes in the first season, but they are all good ones.
There are a few comfortable similarities with Firefly that cause me to favor it so much.  This is the kind of space opera that appreciates androids, genetic manipulation and nanotechnology, not aliens, ray guns, light sabers and space monsters.  There is a ""darker"" theme to it; more so than many other Science Fiction programs.  They try to emphasize the importance of teamwork through it all.  Anyone with a job can appreciate being teamed with a group of various individuals that you yourself would never have chosen.
They certainly aren't to be mistaken for the bridge crew of any major franchise program you have watched since 1966.  There aren't any comic relief robots that bump into the cast members or alien cultures that are ""almost just like us, but in a socially awkward and moving way.""  And for all of that - I love this show.",1454976000,16,1176,4.615384615384615
