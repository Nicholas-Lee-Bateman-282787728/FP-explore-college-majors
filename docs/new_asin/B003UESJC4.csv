4197485,5,B003UESJC4,"This movie is the funniest movie i have ever seen! I was constantly laughing. I'm a huge Twilight fan, but in my opinion, this is better than the original by far!. Even those who don't like Twiight would enjoy the humor of the movie and the fact that it is making fun of Twiight.",1284076800,5,279,4.185185185185185
4197486,3,B003UESJC4,"Shortly into ""Vampires Suck,"" someone puts a Kick Me sign on the heroine's back.  The ""Twilight"" series is (at least in my opinion) so easy to parody it practically has a Kick Me sign of its own.  But this movie fails to take advantage of all the opportunities, though it hits about half.  Sometimes it makes you chuckle; other times - and there are a lot - you just roll your eyes.

Back in the nineties, Alanis Morrisette had a hit called ""Isn't It Ironic.""  What was ironic was that she didn't seem to have a firm grasp of the term.  (Irony is not the same as bad luck.)  Neither do the scriptwriters of this movie.  Merely pointing out that you're being ironic is not enough to be a joke.  In other words, if you're a sourpuss whom hotties inexplicably find attractive, stating this isn't funny in itself.  It reminded me of ""Not Another Teen Movie,"" where characters kept saying things like, ""I'm the Token Black Guy.""  Similarly, this movie has characters pointing out that staring at someone in slo-mo is a sign of true love.  If that's enough to make you laugh, you'll like this movie.

But wait.  There's more.  Throw in a generous helping of gross-out gags and add a smorgasbord of pop culture references, most of them random (the Kardashians, Gossip Girl, Twitter, etc), and add some dance numbers to the mix, season with some homophobic jokes, and there you go.  The good news is that it's pretty short, and the leads all do a great job, especially Jenn Proske, who has Kristen Stewart's lip biting and pensive pouting down cold, so it's not a complete disaster.  But close.

I have to say this is a better movie than ""Epic Movie,"" and ""Date Movie,"" made by the same team.  If you're familiar with those two movies, you know this isn't much of a compliment.  But these parody movies are getting a bit better. Just not that fast.",1283385600,8,1840,4.5181818181818185
4197487,2,B003UESJC4,"It's commonplace these days to hate Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer on general principles. One of the reasons I hate them is that their parodies have virtually no angle of approach. This makes it next to impossible for me to find something about their films worth reviewing. There's nothing there - no themes, no visual techniques, no symbolism, no clever dialogue, no nuanced performances, no item of discussion. There's just unadulterated goofiness, a series of comedic vignettes that don't really go anywhere and aren't connected by a plot. The question is: Can we watch a disjointed mess and still laugh at it? There was a time when I could have answered yes; I remain to this day a fan of the ""Hot Shots!"" films and the ""Naked Gun"" trilogy, all silly and transparent and inconsequential, but also undeniably funny.

But the days of Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker have long gone. Now we have Friedberg and Seltzer, men most critics would like nothing more than to watch burn at the stake, their scripts serving as kindling. I understand their feelings. They're not funny. They're not talented. They know how to make movies in the strictest sense - making use of cameras, actors, sets, special effects, costumes, and makeup - but they have absolutely no idea how to tell a story. They reached a new low with ""Disaster Movie,"" quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. The only film of theirs I've given a pass to is ""Meet the Spartans,"" which, to this day, I'm still getting flak for. You'll forgive me if I have no control over what I think is funny. Yes, ""Meet the Spartans"" made me laugh. Get over it.

Having said all that, I now find myself in the position of reviewing their newest film, ""Vampires Suck,"" a spoof of the ""Twilight"" saga. The second word of the title is fitting. It would be much easier, and would take up far less time, to describe what doesn't suck about this film, and even then I'm acting out of desperation since the jokes really aren't all that funny. There are two moments that stick out in my mind. One is when the female lead gets her first look at the Edward Cullen parody and describes him as having ""pale skin, really big hair, and a constipated look on his face."" The other is when the Jacob Black parody removes his shirt without provocation and then holds up his contract, which states that he has to appear shirtless every ten minutes of screen time. He then repeatedly sprays his chest and abs to make them glisten.

There's no need to describe the plot, regardless of how intimately familiar you are with the real ""Twilight"" films or the books that inspired them. The film stars Jenn Proske as Becca Crane. Get it? It's Becca instead of Bella, and her surname is Crane instead of Swan, like the birds! Matt Lanter plays her vampire boyfriend, Edward Sullen. Get it? His character always acts sullenly, and Sullen rhymes with Cullen! Chris Riggi plays a werewolf named Jacob White. Get it? His name is a color, and it's now the opposite of Black! Three evil vampires eventually appear, one girl and two guys; when they pose, a fisherman mistakes them for the Black Eyed Peas. Bookending the film are references to a rivalry between those on Team Jacob and those on Team Edward. One girl, and I forget which side she's on, outdoes her opponent by whacking her across the face with a shovel.

I think I deluded myself into believing I would like this movie. After all, I've thus far been very unimpressed by the ""Twilight"" saga; if I can't enjoy them as serious films, I figured, maybe I can enjoy watching someone else make fun of them. No such luck. As it turns out, I would rather watch all three ""Twilight"" films back to back than have to sit through ""Vampires Suck"" again. This is a desperately unfunny movie - unfunny and unfocused, Friedberg and Seltzer lacking the conviction to develop their jokes properly. Some are dragged out to the point of monotony, such as Becca's inability to deduce that her new hometown is rife with vampires, even when shops signs and banners make it abundantly clear. Others aren't followed through, such as when Edward throws a rock and randomly hits a girl looking very much like Alice from Tim Burton's latest film. Others still are just plain odd, like references to the Kardashians and, of all people, the Canadians.

The more I see parodies like ""Vampires Suck,"" the sadder I get, for it seems that inane escapism has given way to complacency. Neither ""Hot Shots!"" nor ""The Naked Gun"" can be considered art, but at least an effort was being made with its humor. Now, it's as if no one is even trying. How much thought do you think went into the scene of Edward juggling an apple, a bowling ball, and a baby, all of which just happened to roll out of Becca's backpack? How about when Jacob's shirtless pack arrives, at which point they spank themselves and dance lewdly to the Weather Girls' ""It's Raining Men""? It's useless to complain; all five of Friedberg and Seltzer's movies have made money, despite none of them reaching the 10% mark on the Rotten Tomatoes scale. Clearly, they know something I don't. Either that, or audiences' perceptions of what is and isn't funny has drastically changed. Either way, it depresses me.",1282089600,5,5228,4.653679653679654
4197488,5,B003UESJC4,"I've always loved parodies, and hated the Twilight series, and this movie was borderline perfection. I loved all the jokes and gags regarding anything related to Twilight, teenage drama, and other pop-culture. Jason Freidberg and Aaron Seltzer are definitely getting better. This movie blends Twilight and New Moon together and a few references to the other books. Jenn Proske was amazing as Becca Crane. She had Kristen Stewart's personality and mannerisms down pat. Matt Lanter also pulled a great and hilarious performance as Edward Sullen.

When Becca moves back to Sporks, Washington with her over-protective dad, she is an outcast and slowly begins to fall in love with a vampire named Edward. After Edward dumps her, she becomes torn between him and Jacob White. When Edward thinks Becca is dead, he decides to reveal himself at Prom in front of the Zolturi. Soon, Edward is forced to turn Becca into a vampire. If you love parodies and hate Twilight, I highly recommend VAMPIRES SUCK!!!",1282089600,6,994,5.060975609756097
4197489,3,B003UESJC4,"I am a total Twihard, and I have to say that this movie was pretty good. The girl playing Becca (Bella) plays Kristen so well. It mixes Twilight and New Moon very well.

4197490,3,B003UESJC4,"""Vampires Suck"" is a highly enjoyable spoof of the ""Twilight"" Saga that takes on the ridiculousness of that teen vampire franchise. The movie is surprisingly enjoyable even to someone who hasn't seen the movies but has read all four Twilight books. There are several on-point jokes about the current cultural phenomenon like the Kardashians, vampires, and celebrities on Twitter, among others. It's worth watching the 76-minute movie if for nothing else than to see the ending.",1280707200,6,477,5.2894736842105265

In Vampires Suck, the actor is much better, far more human, capable of acting, looks more like a real person, and most importantly of all, is capable of acting as IF they were Kristen Stewart, meaning they can act well, but also know how to act bad.
The comedy is constant, and funny.  There were parts that literally made me cringe at the sight of body parts being disfigured.  Overall, it was better than the actual Twilight movies were.",1444521600,,531,4.510416666666667

So this movie was very hilarious!  The best parts were Diedrich Bader as Becca's father I tell you, that guy is funny no matter what role he's in!  And Becca, (Our Bella for this movie) she really gave a good performance.  The spoofs of Jacbo and Edward are so funny and they have no problem poking fun at the fans of this series and also point out all the problems with these movies that others have pointed out.  My favorite joke is when Buffy the Vampire Slayer shows up and there is a bit of physical comedy between her and Becca.

There are a lot of small throw away jokes and they make you chuckle and make you wish you had thought of making those jokes yourself while you were watching the movies these were based on.

I also HATE twilight.

So my hate for twilight made me bypass my hate for raunchy comedy movies. And I LOVE this movie. it was hilarious, and I find unforgettable. I haven't bought it, but this movie rocks. it's been years since I saw it and I still remember most of it. It's amazing.",1401926400,,359,4.188405797101449

4198011,4,B003UESJC4,"As a non-Twilight lover, I thought this was hilarious. It really nails all the ridiculous melodrama and bad acting from the first two movies. Jenn Proske does a perfect spoof of the wooden Kristen Stewart. Diedrick Bader is very funny as ""Becca""'s father. If you like spoof movies you'll enjoy this, but as with most films of this genre, you really have to watch the target of the jokes to appreciate it!",1396137600,2,404,4.625

4198014,5,B003UESJC4,"I am a Twilight fan but I think this was hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing through it. Some of the craziest stuff happens, Charlie with the blow up doll was so funny and just little i guess additional Easter eggs. Like the people going to see ""Breaking dawn part 1"" in the theater. It's really funny...I don't know if every Twilight fan will enjoy it like I did, but the haters will have a field day with it.",1393200000,2,410,4.269230769230769
4198015,4,B003UESJC4,Becca was spot on Bella. Kristen Stewart has the acting ability of a stale potato chip and this girl played her perfectly down to every stupid mannerism.,1392595200,,153,4.703703703703703

I laughed so hard I went into a fit of coughing and had tears in my eyes.  Rib cage cracking laughter.  I am a huge Twilight Saga fan and own all the books and movies.  I watched the movies countless times so each scene is burned into my memory.  This move is like a SNL in movie form.  Worth the cost to rent and own.,1392163200,2,427,3.895348837209302

4198039,1,B003UESJC4,"Warning!  Spoiler posibility if you read this!  I wish I hadn't ordered this movie.  It was vulgar.  The character Edward revealing himself as a vampire stripped all clothes off and there was a disco ball in front of his crotch.  Then the conversation between Bella and her father riding in his police car was just gross.  He actually says her ""t$ts"" have grown.  Absolutely no humor, just offensive.  It was a seriously poor attempt at a parody of the movie Twilight.  The humor and satire could have been so successful but it was so bad I couldn't watch even 15 minutes of the movie.  It was a horrible waste of money.  As I started watching the movie with my family I gave it three opportunities before I finally just ended it.  Sad :(",1383523200,,738,4.466165413533835

I am not normally a fan of ""spoofs"", but this one had me rolling around, crying tears of mirth, and rushing to the potty to empty my bladder to avoid emergencies ensuing.  I was laughing so hard, my husband came out of the office to see what was so funny.

He didn't think the movie was as funny as I did, but he laughed at me laughing.  Maybe it just caught me on the right night, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one.",1382659200,,582,4.151785714285714

It's lost its humor the more I watch it. Now, it just sits in my DVD pile while I shuffle through the movies around it.

If were one of the many who facepalmed and headdesked over how Twilight was becoming a phenomenon, or if you watched and love the RiffTrax, you'll love Vampires Suck as well.  It really rips the franchise a new one in some pretty hilarious ways and sometimes doesn't even exaggerate that much to show how stupid some of the original plot points were.

But the best part of all is Jenn Proske's acting.  She deserved some sort of comedy award for this film.  Her entire time in the film is one long, unbroken, near-perfect impersonation of Kristen Stewart.

The Kristin Stewart spoof was so accurate that it had me laughing until I cried. Of course, the jokes are obvious, that's what makes them so fun. My favorite was when she tries to pounce on Edward with her underwear for the directionally-impaired vampire. Stupid, yes, but well worth watching.

4198274,4,B003UESJC4,"It is no secret around my house that I love spoof movies and when I heard they were making a mockery of Twilight, I couldn't help tuning in. The result is a sometimes truly hilarious, sometimes plain offensive, sometimes downright stupid parody of one of the most popular cult favorites of our time.

Becca (Jenn Proske) has a hard life: in spite of being generally boring and lacking in a personality, not to mention plain, the hottest guys in school without fail always fall madly in love with her. It's tough being desirable for no reason and it doesn't help when she moves to the moody, foggy town of Sporks that she immediately catches the attention (and perhaps repulsion) of the hottest ... err... coldest guy in school: Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter). He seems to be quite mysterious, rather pale, and has the whitest teeth she has ever seen. One person not thrilled that she is hanging out with the richest boy in town is her friend Jacob (Chris Riggi), who has his own secrets... and a strange obsession with chasing cats. And then there is the murders happening around town... could they have anything to do with... vampires?

This was a good idea that could have been executed better. Some of it is genius -- rearranging scenes from the first two Twilight films and putting in additional dialogue and one liners is the cleverest it gets, and I must admit that I did bust out laughing at a prolonged scene of Becca flailing about on the forest floor, throwing the mother of all tantrums at her vampire boyfriend abandoning her -- on a scooter, no less. (That got the biggest howl from me.) Watching characters carry on platonic conversations while all-out fights are transpiring in the background is also great, and I have to hand it to the actress -- she has Kristen Stewart's mannerisms down pat, right down to the awkward lip-bite and tucking hair behind her left ear. I also have to hand it to them for finding handsome actors for the roles of their heroes, and they do poke good-natured fun at some of the things that amuse non-fans the most about the franchise -- at one point, Jacob whips off his shirt and when Becca asks why, he answers that it's in his contract -- he has to be shirtless every ten minutes of screen time. There's also a hilarious lack of political correctness, such as Bella remarking to Jacob that it must be nice to drink and gamble all day on the reservation, rather than attending school, and three vampires being offended that they are mistaken for a particular rock group -- when there are no white guys in the group.

Sadly... the film overall is not worth remembering, mostly because it is dragged down by vulgar jokes and sexual references (come on, is that the best you can do?). I think it could have been much funnier and stronger in its parody had it refrained from being so blatantly crude, because in my opinion, crudeness just isn't as funny as wit, banter, and slapstick. The potential was lost and in several instances, I thought up humorous things that they did not consider but that would have worked really well within the context of the plot. In short, if you love Twilight, you may find this offensive, and if you don't love Twilight, you may find this off and on funny, but in my opinion it's not worth the smut just for a few laughs. Rent the actual Twilight movies, turn the volume down, and spoof them with your friends instead.",1332892800,2,3390,4.58154859967051
4198275,5,B003UESJC4,"Spoof movies are a guilty pleasure of mine. I have loved them ever since the day that I first saw the now legendary and classic spoof movie ""Airplane!"". Vampires Suck carries on the tradition of the spoof movie by poking fun at the popular Twilight movies. Now, to be honest, I enjoy the Twilight films. I even took my Wife to see the latest Twilight movie, Breaking Dawn Part 1, and we both had a great time. They're fun little movies in their own right, if you don't take them too seriously. Anywhoos...Vampires Suck is the story of Becca Crane, played wonderfully here by Jenn Proske, who is a high school teenager that meets and falls in love with a vampire that goes to her school and is also in her biology class. This vampire student is named Edward Sullen, played superbly by Matt Lanter. Now, mind you, half the fun of this movie is knowing the source material on exactly who these characters are spoofing, and all I can say is, Jenn and Matt do a great send-up job on the characters that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson portray in the Twilight Saga films.

Vampires are quickly overtaking the little town of Sporks, Washington, and Becca's dumb and clueless father, portrayed by the great Diedrich Bader, who is the Sheriff of Sporks, can't seem to get to the bottom of the mystery. Meanwhile, the mortal enemies of the vampires are the werewolves, which just so coincidentally one of them happens to be another local boy that Becca knows named Jacob, played by Christopher N. Riggi. Jacob falls madly in love with Becca, and warns her about staying away from Edward...and, well, we get a whole lot of hilarious gags based on this preposterous love triangle.

You really do have to be familar with the Twilight Saga premise in order to enjoy this spoof movie because while it's titled Vampires Suck, there's really not a whole lot of vampire spoofing in this film outside of the Twilight movies. But, for what it does poke fun at, Vampires Suck does very well. I give it two wooden stakes up.",1330128000,9,2007,4.603351955307263

I am a fan of Twilight, and think the books and films are beautifully done, but I also have a sense of humor.  I do not not mind spoofs, but I believe there is a certain limit on how far you can go. I am not old, heck, I am in my early twenties, but rest assure, I just do not find this movie funny or tasteful.  The only tiny micro-second scene that I like was when Jacob(Who cannot hold a candle to Lautner)shifted into a chihuahua.  This is only because I love the breed, and have one of my own. The Simpsons have been making parodies and spoofs since '87, and only one of the hundreds of episodes was not funny.  And it was not the Twilight one if you are asking.

The only even redeeming aspect of the movie is Jenn Proske, who added something to the Bella Swan character.

4198301,4,B003UESJC4,"The quality of comic spoofs has seriously diminished over the years, focusing more on grossing you out rather than poking fun at a popular movie franchise. I think of how awful The Scary Movie sequels have become. The many recycled imitators (Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Meet the Spartans, etc) are more of an exercise in crudeness than humor. While Vampires Suck does have some grossness (and a lot of stupidity), it really is more about the mile a minute gags aimed at the Twilight Saga. It is a film that those who hate--or love--the Twilight series can appreciate and laugh at. This film reminded me a lot of the old Spy Hard, Hot Shots, and Naked Gun films with Leslie Neilson, which offered quick and witty lines, slapstick humor and clever timing. Although the directors for this film bombed with some earlier films (the aforementioned Meet the Spartans, Date Movie and Disaster Movie come to mind), Vampires Suck does scale down the gross and lewd level and mainly focuses on taking full aim at pop culture and Twilight. Celebrities, popular artists are fair game as well. The lead actress, Jenn Proske, does a fine job of mimicking Bella. There are many clever, witty lines scattered throughout, and this is a satire that finally works.

Over all, Vampires Suck really doesn't suck that much. Actually, it is a great spoof with some bite and insight, which rises above some of the recent spoof failures aimed at dumbing down comedy.",1322870400,5,1441,4.810483870967742

4198304,2,B003UESJC4,"Amazingly, Vampires Suck does show progress for writers/directors Friedberg and Seltzer.  Unlike Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, and Disaster Movie (all extremely terrible, pointless, and unfunny), this movie is just mostly unfunny.  Also unlike all their previous projects--which would just constantly throw random pop-culture references at the audience--this movie almost manages to stay completely in the Twilight/teen-vampire-romance genre.  And while it has some random moments and incidents who's consequences are erased by the next scene, they are kept to a minimum.

Oh, and the most exiting thing, there's actually a plot! Not just a paper-thin, full-of-holes excuse to bundle together unfunny references and racial stereotypes!  Someone must have actually managed to finally explain to Friedberg and Seltzer what a plot is, and they must have thought ""hey, let's try that!"" Not only did they try, but they came dangerously close to competently cramming the whole Twilight series into one movie.

Sure, most of the jokes aren't funny, and the ones that are have been around on You Tube for years, but after watching the brain-melting dribble of their previous films, I can't help but applaud their efforts to improve.

Those who have seen any of their usual output need any more information. ""Vampires Suck,"" ditto for the movie.

Actually, ""Vampires Suck"" is not all bad. There are a few chuckles here and there. I know nothing about the leading lady Jenn Proske (this is her debut). She is pretty good as Becca Crane, a parody version of Kristen Stewart's annoyingly overwrought performance as Bella Swan.

""Vampire Sucks"" sends up the first two ""Twilight"" films. For those who are not interested in the hugely popular franchise, this parody makes little sense. And for the ""Twilight"" fans and haters out there, ""Vampire Sucks"" remains unamusing throughout, with desperate attempts for cheap laughs using irrelevant pop culture and celebrity references, plus physical jokes like kicking, hitting and smacking thrown in randomly.

4198393,2,B003UESJC4,"The film parody has become an overused genre these days. When AIRPLANE and Mel Brook's movies hit back in the seventies the genre was in its infancy and most of those movies were hilarious. But that changed after a while. The jokes became far too predictable and shows like SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE and SCTV gave us better parodies that didn't drag for an hour and a half.

A parody that did well was SCARY MOVIE. The problem was that the success of that film inspired studio execs to make sequel after sequel with each one worse than the previous effort. And from the writers of those movies came Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Trust me, if you see these two names on a movie marquee, choose whatever else is playing. Ads have touted films as ""made by two of the names behind SCARY MOVIE"". Well they may have been involved in that film, but apparently the talent found in them was to be found in the rest of the writers. This is the pair responsible for DISASTER MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE, DATE MOVIE and MEET THE SPARTANS. If you liked those more power to you. If not, then avoid there movies unless you rent them for $1 or less.

This brings us to VAMPIRES SUCK. The movie is a parody of the current fad of vampire movies portraying vampires as objects of lust and desire rather than fear, focusing mainly on the TWILIGHT films. Nods to other films run through this movie but they mainly aim their barbs that direction.

Becca Crane (Jenn Proske) is a lonely teen stuck in the small town her father is a sheriff in. Of course the most romantic is Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter). Get it? Sullen? That's the level of humor found here. In any event, the film follows a combination of various scenes from the TWILIGHT films and attempts to make them funny. The thing is for some of us the actual TWILIGHT films were funnier than what is offered here.

Don't get me wrong, this film is perhaps one of the best that this pair has made. There are a few good jokes tossed in here and I'm not going to share those with you because should you choose to watch the film a few paragraphs will spoil it for you. It would take just those few words to describe the good moments seen here.

When I first watched the film I didn't think it was really that bad. But the more I thought about it, the more I compared it to the films that Mel Brooks and the Zucker brothers have made, the worse it felt.

The best part of the film is Jenn Proske. She totally captures the lame acting that Kristin Stewart has displayed in the TWILIGHT movies. I'm not saying she's bad here, I'm saying that she portrays Becca the exact same way that Stewart does Bella Swan. So much so that you'll wonder if you watching Stewart from time to time.

The one thing this movie does is make you miss other movies. I miss those great vampire movies of the past. I miss Christopher Lee as Dracula in HORROR OF DRACULA. I miss Frank Langella in DRACULA. I miss great parodies like BLAZING SADDLES, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and even a great vampire spoof like LOVE AT FIRST BITE. This movie doesn't do those justice. It may not be the worst film out there, it may even be worth a $1 rental, but it is not something you're likely to add to your collection or find yourself cued up for on Netflix.",1298592000,4,3233,4.351575456053068

Ok, now I know I'm probably going to get beaten for reviewing this movie...but hey, it's about vampires and it's the hot kid from 90210! So give me a break, ok?

Anyway, I'm a dubious fan of spoof movies because I don't find them that funny even though I find myself getting sucked in and watching them and then being all angry for having wasted ninety minutes of my life (Meet the Spartans, anyone?) I held off from watching Vampires Suck until just this past weekend. Given that I'm gearing up to read The Passage by Justin Cronin, I figured that some serious vampire laugh therapy was needed. That said, apart from some minor eye-rolling, I did get a couple laughs even if it only got rated at a pretty terrible single-digit 4% on the Rotten Tomatoes tomatometer.

Basically Vampires Suck is a spoof of the first two Twilight movies. In the tiny town of vampireville Sporks, Becca, a misunderstood, angst-ridden teenager, is torn between two boys - the segway-riding vampire and the cat-hunting werewolf. Everything from then on goes toe-to-toe with the scripts from Twilight and New Moon, and then it all comes to a head at the prom when Becca gets her wish to be with Edward forever. Go Team Edward!

Yeah, you read those three lines right. That's it. That's the summary. It's pretty much exactly what happened. Other than the segway and the werewolf ""Raining Men"" dance (which were both shown in the previews), there wasn't a ton of laughs to be had. The best part about this movie was Jenn Proske, whose impersonation of Kristen Stewart literally had me in tears every time she opened her mouth. She could have been her doppelganger. I also liked that Jacob kept running off after random cats, but that was only because I love the dogs in Up who scream ""squirrel"" and lose all concentration. But sadly, that was pretty much it.

Overall, as far as spoofs go, this one barely rated, and belongs in the pile where Disaster Movie and Epic Movie ended up. My recommendation? Only watch it if it's 1) free and 2) you get something inexplicably rewarding out of seeing Twilight made fun of (this means you, you Twi-haters). I'd rate Vampires Suck half a star, just for Matt Lanter's sparkly hot bod.",1298332800,5,2224,4.663265306122449

4198396,4,B003UESJC4,"Actress Jenn Proske is tops! Not only is she hot, she plays the shy female character of the Twilight saga (aka ""Becca"" in this comedy) extremely well! The way each of her scenes is timed heightened her acting that accurately portrays a genuinely shy female character. ""Becca"" in this spoof = ""Bella"" of the Twilight saga of yesteryear.

I'm NOT a fan of the teenage girl craze - the ""Twilight"" movie series:

I think the movie production of the original ""Twilight"" saga was too rushed and the wolves look too much like computer animations hurriedly pasted onto a digital screen.

I don't understand what attracts human girls to that cold-blooded Edward character!
Girls just love danger, don't they? They do that even in real life, usually going for bloodsuckers. I can never understand girls. They love to get whacked and then turn around and complain that ""all men are the same"". LOL!

To counteract the craze of the original ""Twilight"" movies, I knew just had to get this ""Vampires Suck"" movie to see if there can be an alternative story-line. Am I glad to have watched ""Vampires Suck""! Sure, no movie is perfect and some scenes in this comedy can be improved to solidify each of the hilarious moments. Strangely, it is this ONE comedy that helps me understand what the original ""Twilight"" saga is all about! This comedy seems to be somewhat self-explanatory. Each scene of Becca tells it all, even if you've never watched ""Twilight"" before.

Forget about original ""Twilight"" saga craze, watch this comedy instead!
If only this movie can be franchised into a string of sequels!

I am voting actress Jenn Proske as the next prom queen!

4198427,4,B003UESJC4,"Given that this is a spoof I have to say that the caliber of actors is higher than that of the actual Twilight franchise.  The main character Becca in particular is a much more believable actress than Kristen Stewart.  Its too bad they didn't cast her as Bella instead.  Plus, the Edward character in this satire is by far the better looking ""hero"" compared to Pattinson.

As a spoof it is somewhat lacking but it did have its moments.  All in all I would say for a certain audience, this is not a waste of time.",1296432000,2,512,4.291666666666667
4198428,3,B003UESJC4,"After going through three somehow outragously popular movies and four angst-ridden novels, one would think it was high time for a spoof of Twilight to be born. After all, there are hundreds of them on Youtube, and come on, let's be honest: the franchise practically begs for a good spoof. So I was amused to hear an official one had been scheduled, but thought it wise to save my money and wait to rent the spoof- because frankly, these movies are usually a waste of talent, money, and time.

Clearly from the negative reaction, nobody really liked this movie. But I was surprised to find myself laughing harder than I had in a long time at this silly movie. The humor is well-done and excellently paced, typically lasting five minutes without some gag, and it pokes fun at Twilight in every way imaginable. Granted, most of the humor I laughed so hard at was slap-stick and, in one case, toilet humor (come on, a fart can be occasionally funny). But it was stupid laughs, and I was grateful for this movie cheering me up a bit.

Naturally, these kind of movies come ridden with sexual innuendos, and there were a couple cringe-worthy jokes sprinkled throughout the layers of ""Vampires Suck"". You have to be ready to ignore these and accept the movie for the bigger picture- it's just a movie making fun of a movie, made by grown-ups who never really grew up.

The acting was well-done, and they all timed their humor perfectly. Some of the gags were outright random (Lady Gaga, vampire squirrel) and others placed there with no coincidence (the joke about Tiger Woods, anyone?), and most of it was unbeliavable and slapstick, but throughly funny. It's almost worrying how perfectly the main actress who portrays Becca (aka Bella) nails Kristen Stewart's awkward lip-biting, twitchy, blinking performance in Twilight. It openly makes fun of Edward, what with his angsty expressions and poofy hair. The movie adds in jokes that you know can be traced directly from Twilight and a few jokes that we as the audience have sufficed (for example, the fact that Bella is a boring, awkward individual, and yet every hot guy has a thing for her).

Overall, it's the kind of movie either you'll like or you'll hate. I fully expected to turn it off halfway through, but ended up enjoying it. Swimming through the vast pop references (I'm shocked Justin Bieber didn't appear somewhere alone the line) and tongue-in-cheek humor (Bella's room has been left exactly the way she left it- quite literally), it's a fun, stupid movie that's worth a rent if you love Twilight, or if you love hating Twilight.",1296259200,13,2588,4.757238307349666

It was one of those movies that you watch once and enjoy, but then after that then after you know when all the funny parts are coming they won't jump out and make you laugh, so it wouldn't be funny the second time.

According to my DVD clock, the movie is only 1 hour and 15 minutes. Is that even a legitimate movie time? I thought it was like 1 hour 20 minutes...but..oh well. Family guy's star wars movies are only like 40 minutes.

Originally I would have given this movie a 3/5 because it was so-so and only watchable once, but because it is so rare to find a very beautiful woman who can actually make you laugh (talking about you, Becca's actress) I will give it a 4/5. She earned herself a gold star.

I usually stray away from parody movies of late, mostly due to the fact that they are getting dumber and dumber... not to mention more vulgar as each new movie is made. However, the writers of this movie really did their homework. This movie does a great job of taking all those people obsessed with Twilight and giving them a big 'ole middle finger.

4198436,5,B003UESJC4,"In this adaptation of the story, Becca Crane played by Jenn Proske moves in with her father because her whore mother is shacking up with Tiger Woods.  There is something strange about Sporks. There are vampires everywhere.  She meets Edward Sullen played by Matt Lanter and of course falls desperately in lust. When he tries to reveal himself to her by stripping off his shirt and showing her his bling she guess that he is a Jonas Brother. He finally tells her that he is a vampire which she states would have been her next guess.

For her 18th birthday he brings Becca home to meet the family but things go horribly wrong when she gets a paper cut and they all try to eat her. Fortunately someone ordered Chinese food and the delivery man is quickly tossed to them so that Ed and Becca can make their narrow escape.

He brings her to the woods where he leaves her but not before he saves her from, three dangerous vampires. He kills Jack (James) by knocking his head off with a baseball bat.

Becca is attended to by her friend Jacob White who is just as hot as Tyler Lautner. He makes her feel safe and takes his shirt off often because it is in the script to happen every 10 minutes.

Edward is living in Italy with Lady Gaga when Iris finds him to tell him she had a vision. Becca had a motorcycle accident and is dead.

Edward can't live with this and heads out to have himself killed before Iris can tell him that her vision was wrong.

Iris picks up Becca and explains what Edward is going to do. They race to the prom where he will reveal himself and his saggy, butt to the Zolturi who are party animals and would never miss a prom according to Iris.

He reveals himself while Becca tries to run through the red cloaked, prom crowd. Getting involved in a jello fight and trying to get through a group of Team Edward and Team Jacob teenagers fighting each other.

Edward is forced by the Zolturi to make Becca Vampire. He agrees after she accepts his proposal and ring. He bites her. A Team Jacob chick takes him out and is attacked by a Vampire Becca.

What I Can Tell You:
That is the movie in a nutshell. The actors are awesome and do the characters major justice.  All the nuances are there.  Bella's downcast eyes, hair behind the ears every second, weird mouth movements and stutter.  This is the actresses first movie and she is totally and completely Bella.  She deserves an award for being Kristen Stewart.  Edward, is hot even with the rollers he uses to create the now famous coif. Which he sports when watching Becca sleep.

I loved the entire movie and watched it with a complete smile on my face and can't wait to watch it again with friends.

There are some truly hysterical scenes if you like stupid humor. Like her father tells her that he left her bedroom the way she left it and when he opens the door there is a crib and toys in it. He stuffs a pacifier in her mouth before walking out of the room.

There is even a quick nod to Stephanie Meyer. I thought it was hysterical and think Twilight fans will love it.

But curiosity got the better of me and I watched them anyways and to my great horror they were ever worse then I had imagined they would be.
However, Vampires Suck was AWESOME! Just watching Jenn Proske's phenomenal impersonation of Kristen Stewart's twitchy performance was enough to have me laughing like a maniac.

All the parts that I laughed at were what they showed in the trailer. Now, I'm all for spoof movies, always have been but this was nothing more than a giant let down. Like they were trying far too hard. I feel bad for Matt Lanter and Zane Holtz because they're two brilliant up and coming actors and this movie was a joke.

Maybe I thought this movie would be good because it makes fun of a series I just cant stand but instead it is actually worst. The jokes are stupid and the references are as well. I don't care if you are a Twilight fan, stay away from this movie.

I miss the good old days when they made a spoof, they didn't add elements from every single recent movie. They just had a plot (sometimes simular to an existing movie) and made jokes that were actually fun and goofy. Now for the special features. A wise dvd critic once said that if a movie is really bad..who cares about the special features. In this case...even if the movie was slightly good. The special features are as bad as the entire movie itself..if not worst.

*Gag Reel- Double Yawn

As others point out the story is disjointed, poorly written and not funny.  I was hoping for a truly funny movie like Dodgeball (well written and unique).  This movie relies totally on senseless violence and parody.  The main point I would like to emphasize however is the brutal hazing and bullying that goes on in this movie.  As someone who works with kids who have been subjected to bullying and abuse I did not expect to see this film coated with it.  The character Becca (Jenn Proske) is verbally and physically assaulted throughout the film.  A few examples: her first day of school she is egged, kicked, hit and verbally attacked.  Later she is called a loser for not going to prom and hit in the head with a bottle.  I don't mind the off-beat, slapstick and sometimes over the top kind of violence of some comedies but this is mean-spirited, excessive, tormenting violence.  The other characters suffer through unnecessary violence throughout the story-less movie.  In fact the movie starts with a fight between Team Jacob and Team Edward fans where girls wearing the appropriate T-shirt brutally hit each other with clubs and shovels.  Almost anytime a character has anything go wrong, their answer is swift and savage.  Is senseless violence really funny with no other jokes or story?  If so this is your movie.

4198588,3,B003UESJC4,"While I am a fan of both the Twilight books and movies, I would easily admit that they cut a pretty wide swath of things about which they can be mocked.  This parody turns up a fairly equal showing of hits and misses.  Jenn Proske's portrayal of Becca (Bella's doppelganger) is so full of Kristen Stewart's facial tics, hair tugs, vacant stares, and stutters, you almost wonder if she tried out for the original role of Bella (and she might have been able to do a better job at that).  Matt Lanter's Edward Sullen is so physically similar to Robert Pattinson's Edward Cullen in the first movie he could be his stunt double, and he plays a particularly mopey version of Edward well.  Chris Riggi (Jacob White) plays Jacob jokes that are obvious and not so obvious.  Obvious: he's contractually obligated to take off his shirt every ten minutes and has a visible tail even in human form; not so obvious: he gets distracted and runs after cats at key points in conversations, and his ""wolf"" form is a chihuahua.  The movie is a fast combo of the plots of the first two Twilight movies, so if you haven't seen the Twilight movies, I doubt you will enjoy this.  The comedy is a bizarre mix of ironic, subtle, predictable, and crass.  I laughed out loud when Becca catches Edward in her bedroom in plaid flannel jammies, his uber-exaggerated James Dean coif rolled up in pink curlers, and wrestling with a tooth-whitening strip, but there is enough potty humor throughout to make you groan.  I appreciated the gentle elbow nudge given to the noticeable increase in the amount of makeup Bella/Becca started wearing from the transition from the first movie into the second movie.  However, I wish the writers had shot for more irony and less cheap generic shots (""Would you care for finger food?""), as the Twilight franchise leaves plenty of room for tongue-in-cheek mockery.  If you're a fan of Twilight, can take a joke and aren't offended by college-boy humor, give this a shot - you probably won't wish for the 90 minutes back.  Don't expect irony on the level of The Princess Bride, though - you'll be disappointed.  If you're unsure, wait until it's available to rent.",1291593600,5,2166,4.683377308707124

Am glad I did, but because 'satire' is not my favorite genre, I'll pass this along to others to laugh at too.

As a rule I do not review books and movies (always afraid to spoil / give something away - and just because I like or don't like something doesn't mean you won't love or hate it - right?

I am glad I bought it and saw it, and did laugh in many places, and laughed with my wife who was ""rolling her eyes"" a lot...

/snicker

One little tip - the young lady in the role of (who would be) Bella - really did try to use some of her mannerisms - which made it so very silly and funny~!

Call me slow - I did not get about 20% of the gags - oh well, that's pretty good for me :)

When we saw the trailers and previews for this movie we looked at each other and said. WE HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATER!

There were a lot of lame jokes (like in all the other movie parodies), but there were enough to get me laughing pretty good.  It's one of those movies that, if it were playing on TV, I might stop to watch it.  Maybe I'd rent it if I needed cheap laughs and had one of those days where I got bombarded with Twilight fanatics.  My sister liked it enough that it's going to be her Christmas gift, and if I thought it were truly terrible, I'd tell her to stuff if and pick something else.

4198617,1,B003UESJC4,"Becca, an anxious, non-vampire teen, is torn between two boys. Before she can choose, Becca must get around her controlling father, who embarrasses Becca by treating her like a child. Meanwhile, Becca's friends contend with their own romantic issues - all of which collide at the prom.

VAMPIRES SUCK will surprise many people because it's an improvement over the previous spoof films directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have been churning out for the past couple of years. However, that's like saying it's the better crap of all crap. The jokes still aren't funny and the filmmakers still don't realize the difference between satirizing and copying. But I would be lying to myself if I said I didn't find some good that came out of this film because there are some improvements.

First of all, the performances are great by the two leads. In her first film, Jenn Proske does a dead on impersonation of Kristen Stewart. However, it's sad to see her in this because I think she's better than this. Matt Lanter also does a great impersonation of Robert Pattinson in his ""pain"" look. I don't know what made Ken Jeong come aboard the film but he's basically playing the same character in THE HANGOVER. He's not in the film that much, though. Also, I think it's pretty great that Carmen Electra isn't in here and I'm sure others will agree.

The second obvious thing that stuck out to me was that the film focused on only the first two TWILIGHT films. The filmmakers finally learned that spoofing 600 movies is a bad thing. Saying that, the film still does have the many pop culture references, some too random to comment about. Fortunately, they really did tone it down quite a bit compared to the previous films where you get one every five seconds. You probably get one every five minutes here.

I also liked the fact that it looked like an actual film because if you saw MEET THE SPARTANS and DISASTER MOVIE, you'd know the films were filled with shoddy sets made up in ten minutes. In here, you might question if they stole the sets and locations from the TWILIGHT films. I don't know if this counts as something good but I really think the film manages to create a decent storyline from the first two TWILIGHT films.

Overall, the film is still bad because it's rarely funny, although I will admit I laughed at some bits that took a jab at the TWILIGHT series. If the story is better than the jokes itself, you know you got a bad comedy. It's an improvement from the last few spoof films, but that doesn't say much. I really don't recommend seeing it at all. If you must, just rent it on DVD that will inevitably come out a month after the film is released.",1288656000,23,2666,4.569037656903766

4198620,5,B003UESJC4,"If you a fan to the Twilight Saga, then most likely you will enjoy this movie. If you hate the Twilight Saga, you may like this movie, but if you do hate the Twilight Saga movies then why are you seeing a parody? It's practically a re-telling of Twilight and New Moon with an alternate ending, but the movie was really good (for me). This got mixed reviews. The movie is so stupid that its good! Compared to Disaster Movie and Meet the Spartans, this is a real big step up for the directors/writers. This movie was funny and would recommend it, but only if you enjoy stupid humor.",1286496000,20,580,4.330275229357798
4198621,4,B003UESJC4,"I waited until this movie hit the ""cheap"" theaters before I went to see it.  I took my 14-year old son, his 14-year old friend, and my 13-year old son.  They had heard how ""stupid"" the movie was from friends at school, with one of their friends saying only one joke was funny during the entire movie.

Fortunately, when we left the theater, all 3 boys were smiling and even I realized that ""Vampires Suck"" didn't bite after all.  Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the same duo who brought ""Disaster Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"" to the screen, wrote and directed this movie, which is a comedic take off of the three-movie ""Twilight"" series.

Similar to other spoof movies, ""Vampires Suck"" makes fun of a variety of elements from the originals, while at the same time mixing in one-liners that make punchlines of some of our current popular stars, including Lady Gaga, the Kardashians, the Jonas Brothers, and even a mention of Taylor Swift.

Yes, parts of the movie were stupid, and yes, other parts were crude.  However, both these facts are intentional and to be expected.  After all, isn't that what this movie is trying to accomplish?  Some will find it funny and some won't.  I found myself laughing, sometimes to myself, at several different times throughout the rather short 88-minute duration.

And believe it or not, the acting wasn't bad.  Jenn Proske did an admirable job mirroring Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Becca Crane, and Chris Riggi did an excellent parody--with remarkable resemblance--of Taylor Lautner's  incarnation of Jacob White.  Throwing in a couple of familiar faces, i.e. Diedrich Bader and Ken Jeong, gave a touch of credibility as well.

No, ""Vampires Suck"" certainly won't win any Academy Awards, but in the realm of comedic movie spoofs, it delivers a few laughs without leaving a bad taste in your mouth.",1285891200,4,1841,4.893548387096774
4198622,5,B003UESJC4,I went to see this movie with my friends at the movies.  We laughed our @$$es off.  It was hilarious.  The guy who played Jacob in this movie was hot and funny.  But no one can replace Taylor or Robert.  I cant wait to get this movie on DVD.,1285891200,4,241,3.836734693877551
4198623,1,B003UESJC4,"This movie is so stupid! it's a little funny with it's sarcastic refrences, but i really wouldn't bet on this one to be a blockbuster. this movie is so stupid it has even ""Strange Brew"" beat on that scale. Although Jenn Proske does has Kristen Stewert's stutter, lip bite, & trembling down to a ""T"". so i've got to give her Props for that. But for all of that i really don't think i'll be shelling out the $20 to buy it when it comes out on DVD.",1285113600,5,445,4.068181818181818
4198624,1,B003UESJC4,"First off... whoever is responsible for making ""parody"" movies needs to learn the big difference between satire comedy, and just a homosexual fantasy to see a rip off of their favorite vampire characters combined into one joke. The joke being, not funny, but the movie itself... it really should have been released on April 1st, and then stopped being shown at 11:59pm that same day.

I think the death penalty should be placed upon anyone who dares to say this movie is in someway at all funny. Parody films used to mean something when the likes of Mel Brooks, The Zucker Brothers /Jim Abraham had something to do with them, but in recent years the films have been bent over from behind and taken without consent. I don't call this a Parody movie, I call this a Kobe movie.

You may read people saying things as stupid as ""Oh, it's not the best, but it's far better then Epic movie, Silly Movie etc..."" but it still ISNT in the slightest way funny. Trying to compare the latest Kobe films together is like saying, ""that turd has better texture then then that one""

If you have seen the trailer to this film, you have seen all it has to offer. If for some bizarre reason you find it humorous to watch a bunch of gay guys do a disco butt slapping dance, then you may absolutely adore this cute little film. If you are someone who knows that parody is not supposed to be a sexually repressed desire to see half naked men engage in done-to-death ""jokes"" then you will find nothing funny about this film, and have no desire to ever see another new parody film ever again unless it's handed back to the Jewish writers who know how to write something FUNNY.

I seriously doubt anyone praising this movie has ever seen the likes of Airplane, Naked Gun, Hot Shots etc.. else they would not be saying, ""Oh, well, yeah, it's not funny at all, it's like, Twighlight meets True Blood, so I love it <3 xoxoxoxox""",1284422400,2,1899,4.448275862068965
