1982537,2,B00019HP94,"I expected to see more than just the gross movements of the katas. I had hoped from the summary provided on this site that some bunkai would be illustrated. The tape shows each kata done from 2 angles and at varied speeds. You can see angle, direction and stances, but there is no discussion about technique, body mechanics or anything else for that matter. I expected more.",1119398400,4,374,4.597014925373134
8008745,1,B00019HP94,Dvd did not function correctly and I could not view the entire DVD. The DVD was defective . I am sure the content was great..,1486684800,,125,4.04
8008746,1,B00019HP94,This is fraud... DVD does not play on pc it shows message This video format doesn't support seek/pause... I will request for return,1483142400,,131,4.739130434782608
8008747,5,B00019HP94,"Ota Sensei is awesome to watch and techniques are easy to learn.
Liltle bit dissapointed dvd does not have a accessable menu to go to whatever your workin on but the material is so good and clear that it more than makes up for that.",1462233600,,232,4.177777777777778

It was disappointing to receive a poor unplayable unprofessionally produced copy.
I suggest international customers think twice before purchase, as the cost of returning the disc is much greater than it's value.",1378771200,,389,8.487804878048781
8008749,4,B00019HP94,"This is a very informative DVD. It is well presented - each kata is shown at multiple speeds, with varying camera angles so that you can get a really good understanding of the pattern. I have given it only 4 stars as it would have been nice to have a segment on applications of each kata. Kata bunkai is heavily emphasised in my own school - it would have been interesting to see Ota Sensei's views.",1358121600,5,399,4.2631578947368425
8008750,4,B00019HP94,"The video is well done as it goes through real time and a slow motion, so it's easy to follow. However, I was thinking it would have more of the Katas than it actually did.

Also, the Katas had variations from the way I have seen them on the internet as well as how my instructor has shown. This is a little weird considering that all are suppose to be from the same ""syllabus"", so don't be surprised if it varies slightly from your training.

Very good for my son to view and use to practice.",1317081600,,493,4.125
8008751,5,B00019HP94,"The video shows all the katas as they should flow in the class room. This is a GREAT reference for all the katas in this one video. This is a MUST for all students of the system. If you want to know about this art form, you will not get too much from this video. For comparing this art's katas from other art forms, it is Great. Karate is meant to be taught to students in the class room/ person to person so you will not get pointers from this, But again the video states what is in the video.",1238544000,4,494,3.95
8008752,4,B00019HP94,"For the student of this style, the video is worthwhile. The actual steps in some of the kata can very from those taught by Soshin and Takayoshi Nagamine, however. Unfortunately, no bunkai are explained.
I would hope that Master Ota would furnish an addition to his three videos discussing the bunkai of these traditional Okinawan kata.",1188691200,,335,5.0
8008753,2,B00019HP94,"I do not know if I like this dvd yet or not; because I have NOT yet received it.  It takes your company over 2 weeks to deliver. I have placed similar orders to OTHER companies who sale such items, and received them within 2 BUSINESS days.  I do NOT plan to purchase from you again, if I can the items I want someplace else.  I am very surprized you people are still in business after all these years.",1142208000,,401,4.050632911392405
8008754,4,B00019HP94,"This is a little known but wonderful area of martial arts.  My husband studied it for years, and I bought this as a reference for him.  He was surprised, and enjoyed viewing very much.

Of course, the katahs are not exactly what he was doing, and the production was a bit amateur, but it is a great gift for the martial arts enthusiast.",1121817600,4,336,4.301587301587301
