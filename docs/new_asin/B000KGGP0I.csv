8156451,2,B000KGGP0I,"I like to watch travel documentaries, and this was probably the worst I ever saw. I've been to Dublin recently and hoped to see some of the places I visited there. But this very short (20-minute) documentary spent most of the time showing Samantha Brown talking to people, drinking beer and showing off her hotel rooms. After watching it, you would not know that Dublin is home of Trinity College with its famous Book of Kells, wonderful museums, and beautiful St Stephen's Green, birthplace of Oscar Wilde, James Joyce  and many other great people. Save for a brief visit to a cathedral and a nice chat with an organist,  Samantha Brown's  Dublin seemed a cultural desert with nothing much to do except go to the bars. The bars there are charming but are they really the reason to cross the Atlantic?",1520294400,,801,4.666666666666667
