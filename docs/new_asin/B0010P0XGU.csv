8238145,5,B0010P0XGU,"This movie is an adaptation of some of the most popular stories about the Hindu god, Ganesh. Ganesh is one of the most widely known of deities in India, recognizable by his elephant's head. His blessings are invoked to remove obstacles. He personality is joyful and even a bit naughty based on legends of his childhood. This animated version is aimed at children but adults will enjoy it. The movie covers the birth and early childhood of Ganesh (Bal Ganesh = baby Ganesh), showing why his images are drawn the way they are. Lots of music and dance keeps it entertaining. I have enjoyed watching this movie with my 3-year old granddaughter. It is in Hindi with English subtitles available. Technical production of animation is excellent.",1322352000,,737,4.857142857142857

8238147,5,B0010P0XGU,"A very well-made children's show, most suitable for Hindi-speakers, but the subtitles in French, Dutch and English make it accessible to many. The audience will be mostly Indians from all parts of the world.

A spectacular 3-D program, well-written and well-directed. Some of the most remarkable features are the Ganesh dance and the Shiva dance. Many stories from the Puranas are included. The only drawback is that the music is often more Western than Indian.

Pankaj Sharma has given more than a show. While this is a `fun' show, the stories are taken from Indian mythology. Programs like this instill the values and principles of tradition, heritage and religion. The dialogue brings up respect for parents and elders, and meditation. It mentions reading (scriptures) as a characteristic of Ganesh.  This is a responsibly made show that will serve children well in the current times of general confusion. Ganesh serves as a role model that children will like to imitate. The acrobatic and warlike adventures of Ganesh and Karthikeya are areas parents need to monitor the children from trying.

A treat for all ages.",1260057600,4,1119,5.098360655737705
8238148,4,B0010P0XGU,"The movie was interesting and informative, but the English was a little disjointed.  Plus, as it is a cartoon intended for children, it should have had an English sound track.  Many children cannot read fast enough to keep up with the action.

  The movie was alco produced in segments that were not well segwayed (blended) together and some Hindi terms were not translated, which left adult viewers asking what did that mean..??

  However, overall, it was an enjoyable movie.  It just needs some polish and proper translating...",1235606400,3,530,5.0
