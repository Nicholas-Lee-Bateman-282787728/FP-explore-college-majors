2651894,5,B000I2J6W8,"Home Improvement was a show that has set the standard for ethical and humorus family style entertainment.  This is what Disney should still be doing today!  It would be hard to believe that most everyone hasn't seen at least a couple of episodes of this classic commedy.  The quality shines through as the bumbling antic's of the show's star, Tim Allen are as funny today as they were 10 years ago.  Its good clean FUN!  without the boring sexual innuendos and outright disgusting dialog that plague today's ""family"" TV shows.",1164931200,9,526,4.8

Great show! This is an instant classic that is great to collect the whole series and watch numerous times over and over!
The cast each has their own personalities and quirks that make them all independently interesting.

2652157,5,B000I2J6W8,"My family have the first six seasons and enjoy them thoroughly. It has slapstick humor for dad, soft and tender moments for mom, and kids antics for my children. What I like about this program is that the writing is sincere where you can relate to the characters. There is not one episode where my side does not hurt from laughter even after watching them over and over.

Each episode runs about 22 minutes in length. And each one leaves you to wonder how does this guy still have a tool show? It must be Al. What I like about this season is the addition of Tim's brother's family in some of the episodes. The local hardware store also becomes a local hangout for the guys and Benny.

Good family entertainment.",1255737600,,711,4.419847328244275

2652170,5,B000I2J6W8,"cool family fun episodes. Tim Allen is great at it, and all the rest as well, from his wife to his kids, and his neighbour with the hidden face. You also always learn from each story a small lesson about life, and dealing with many sorts of situations, thanks to the neighbour with the secret face :)",1226966400,,300,4.280701754385965
2652171,4,B000I2J6W8,My husband is obsessed with Home Improvement. When he discovered I had ordered these for him he was ecstatic. He watches them everyday. Great purchase.,1224892800,,151,5.08
2652172,5,B000I2J6W8,"This season is definitely one of the best in the series. There are just a lot of episodes that I consider classics in this season. This is the season when Tim gets his Ph. D that makes both Jill and Wilson jealous and this is also the season that has the famous episode about how Randy may have cancer. Whether it is funny or very serious, some of the best episodes are in this season. One of my favorite episodes is ""The Look"". You can't beat the reaction given by Al and Benny when they see it for the first time. You gotta see it for yourself, I couldn't stop laughing! This season also has the first appearance of Tim's mom. You should definitely get this, the writing is still great.",1219795200,,688,4.259541984732825
2652173,5,B000I2J6W8,"Season five of Home Improvement was/is another great season of this hillarious sitcom.  This series never seems to get old.  There are so many episodes on this season that I deem ""classics.""  Watch as the phrase ""brothers shouldn't work together"" gets a special meaning, Tim stands up for Al, that look that women have is made clear, and Tim and Jill race tanks.  There are many hillarious moments in the life of Tim and Jill in this season including Jill asking Tim to get a vasectomy, Tim thinks Jill is cheating on him, and the couple attempt to spend some time alone during a weekend retreat in Chicago.  If you think that is funny, wait to see what is in store for the Taylor lads.  Brad gets a haircut, but it's not normal, Randy goes to high school for two subjects, and Mark learns to fly an airplane!  Watch as Al creates a Tool Time board game, and proposes to Eileen.  Tool Time gets a new boss, and he wants to fire Al!  There are so many moments in Season 5 that are unforgetable, so sit back and watch them, and then watch them again.  This season never gets old.  The only downfall of this DVD set is that the bonus features only inlude another set of bloopers.  It would have been nice to see some making of featurettes.  So in conclusion, I invite you to buy this DVD set and see for yourself how enjoyable this Season of Home Improvement is.  There are not many television series anymore that are as light and funny and downright entertaining as Home Improvement.",1201392000,11,1481,4.416974169741698
2652174,5,B000I2J6W8,"Home Improvement was an awesome show, and Season 5 has some of my favorite episodes. ""The Look"" is hilarious. But the all-time best episode is ""Vasectomy One,"" with Tim dealing with issues regarding ""Man Land,"" and Jill's request for him to undergo a vasectomy.

I recommend this series (""Home Improvement"") to anyone interested in good, clean fun. Also to anyone looking to invest a little time in researching ""pop"" psychology - both are worthwhile pursuits!",1195948800,2,459,5.12

2652176,5,B000I2J6W8,"During this 5th season the show along with its normal pranks and laughter has some very touching episodes, such as the one where they have a health scare with one of thier sons...It is dealt with seriousness and some laugher periods at the same time which makes the episode meaningful to the audience in many wasys. I would highly recommend this season again if you have fallen in love with it from the begining.",1190678400,3,412,4.581081081081081
