5962693,4,B00F1BFL3Y,"As a fan of the period drama, Mr. Selfridge, I was excited to see PBS schedule a documentary about the real-life London department store and the real story of Harry Gordon Selfridge. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Selfridge and his eponymous store proved to be even more larger than life and more lavish--and more scandalous--than Piven and his fellow cast members. Though Selfridge brought American-style salesmanship to England, there still existed that touch of Englishness that set the store apart from its American counterparts. I now wish some American production company would do a documentary on the history of Macy's, Wanamaker's, or Marshall Fields--or maybe Selfridge's rival, Woolworth's!",1388966400,46,710,5.463636363636364

He was an amazing man with an amazing vision, but he has his weaknesses.  This is a must see for anyone watching the hit series Mr. Selfridge! I cannot wait for the final Season 4 to come out!  The way Season 3 ended and what I have read about Season 4, watching this biography will help bring everything into perspective. Excellent buy to add to your DVD library and a must see!",1431907200,10,484,4.488636363636363

5962728,5,B00F1BFL3Y,"A great history of the Selfridges store and also of the man, Mr. Selfridge. I enjoyed knowing more about the person who founded the great department store. Really made me want to see it in person, which can never be. Six floor....amazing and way to big for me to walk around at my age. Also in the wrong country, as I live in the USA.  Well worth the price. In facat, I am giving a copy for Christmas to someone who enjoys the Masterpiece movie: Mr. Selfridge",1419724800,5,459,4.275862068965517

5962733,3,B00F1BFL3Y,Good DVD. But I was hoping for more history of the extended family after Mr Selfridge died. It just concentrated on the store itself.,1407888000,,133,4.583333333333333

5962738,4,B00F1BFL3Y,"We enjoyed this version  of the famous Selfridges after watching both seasons of 'Mr. Selfridge'. Many historical pictures of the interior and spectacular exterior were included and details of the buildings design were revealed. A step back in time to when the idea of shopping for 'pleasure' and the ability to 'browse' merchandise before purchase were developed by Harry Selfridge. Some photos of the real Harry Selfridge were included and his personal life was touched on but  this production barely mentioned his wife and family and personal details of their lives as well. It was mainly a look at the past and present store and how shopping has been changed by Harry Selfridge's innovative ideas. If you want more biographical information about the man and his family you will have to read the book, I guess!",1401321600,11,813,4.970588235294118
5962739,5,B00F1BFL3Y,"Enjoyed watching this history of Selfridges.  I am a fan of the PBS series on Mr. Selfridge and his store.  This is excellent background on the genesis of it.  The founder is a larger than life character.  For as astute as he was about business, it's amazing he wasn't more sensible about his private life.  His gambling and excessive lifestyle doesn't quite fit with his business savvy.  Enjoyed the footage from the time period in which Selfridge lived and how the shop looked then.  One of the more striking facts about Selfridges is that women weren't allowed out unescorted until Selfridges came along as it gave them a place to go which was safe with women's bathrooms.  There weren't public bathrooms in England for women until this store opened. Thoroughly enjoyed the history behind the man and his store.  4.5 stars",1400371200,,825,4.794326241134752

The imagery is spectacular, showing scenes of early and current Selfridges. Good mix of expert interviews, but not so much that they dominate this documentary.

8611350,5,B00F1BFL3Y,"This is an amazing business story about an American who goes to UK and does everything that today's mall do to attract customers but with the difference that what Selfridge did some seventy years ago, was never done before, making a success story in the sales industry through a department store, a concept that never exited before, the first mall in the world. A sad ending but a choice that Selfridge made toward the end of his life himself by losing it all and dying homeless. You will never look at the malls in the same way as you do now after watching this documentary. Informative, well done documentary. Bravo.",1450742400,,618,4.627272727272727
