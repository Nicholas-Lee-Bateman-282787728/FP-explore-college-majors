7901889,5,1568553293,"This will be the third set I,m buying,I wish I could afford this set for all Americans. It will show you about the fight for civil rights in the sixties and the battle that was fought to achieve those rights. It will show you how Americans fought and sacrificed and rationed to help win World War 11. It will show you when we have to spend so much money on war,we eventually had to ration our own food so there was enough food to give our soldiers strength to fight for our freedom, it will show you how we had to ration gas,so we had enough gas for planes and tanks. It will show you how we had to quit making toys and luxorys because we needed all materials to make things for war. It will show you what it took to make America free and sacrifices we had to make and to make you think,can we do this again as our country is surley headed in this path financally and morally. This should be mandoritory viewing for every fifth grader in school to learn about and do a report on it. It might be one of the best and most important videos you may every be priviledged to see.",1199664000,2,1073,4.114285714285714
