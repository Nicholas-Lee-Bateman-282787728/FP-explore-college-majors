2606115,4,B000GETTJI,"It is good quality, the only I would like to receive two discs instead one with a movie per side. It is easier for handling in my case.",1349049600,,135,3.857142857142857
2606116,5,B000GETTJI,Both movies are super... need to watch them to enjoy and know what I mean ! They are both very funny and surprising. Demi&aacute;n Bichir is one of the star actor in one of these movies and he is just great. I truly believe that he is one of Mexico's best actors. Almost all movies that I have watched and he has a role in are GREAT ! He is number one !,1348358400,4,353,3.8493150684931505
2606117,4,B000GETTJI,"NOTE that in order to see each movie, you have to FLIP the disc.  Each movie is on each side of the disc... The movie La Ley de Herodes is a great satire of the political, economic, and moral reality of Mexico.  The acting is great, the dialogues are appropriate and it is just a delight film to enjoy watching with friends regardless of their cultural background since it has subtitles in English.  I highly recommend it to anyone seeking for a good movie to watch.  The other movie is a very BAD film. Sad because it has a great actor in the lead role but poor direction, predictable events, cheesy acting, just an embarrassment of movie.",1344816000,,640,4.444444444444445
2606118,5,B000GETTJI,Deffinately recomend this movie to everyone. I ordered it for a class that I was taking and I had to write a report on it but it will linger in my favorite movie collection from now on.,1336521600,2,185,4.027027027027027
2606119,5,B000GETTJI,"Herod's Law chronicles the transition of a very ordinary young Mexican man into corrupt, murdering politician.  Don't look for subtlety but do expect good story telling. Expect plenty of irony but not quite comedy.",1297641600,2,214,5.294117647058823
2606120,5,B000GETTJI,"La Ley de Herodes (""Herod's Law"") is one of the funniest, most biting political satires I've ever seen. I've bought 4 copies of it: one for myself, the rest as gifts. It's a side-splitting condemnation of the right-wing PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) regime that ruled Mexico for 70 years--until the end of the 20th century--by bribes, extortion, vote-stealing and, at times, harsh violence. Thought set in Mexico circa 1947, the ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" message applies anywhere--certainly including the Washington empire for the past 30 years.

Todo el Poder is excellent, too, exposing the utter corruption of the Mexico DF police.",1268265600,7,655,5.485148514851486
2606121,5,B000GETTJI,"I usually don't buy this kind of dvds where they have two movies. Infact I had never done that and when I purchased this one, I really had no choice into purchasing another version but I am glad I did. Ofcourse, I love the film for which I bought this product, but I was surprised I loved  the second film it included, and all for a reasonable price. I am glad I made this pruchase. and it arrived just in time.",1209340800,3,411,4.074074074074074

8131170,4,B000GETTJI,"La ley de Herodes is funny and sarcastic. A good movie.
