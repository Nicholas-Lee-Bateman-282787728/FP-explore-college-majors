3903360,5,B002C3GTLC,"This show was an example of, from week to week, a show that would make me cry from laughing so hard.  One of those shows that you would snort, and laugh because it made you snort.  Even when you absolutely knew what was coming next, to see it happen was hilarious.  But then, the season ended, new season began and it was nowhere to be found on television.  Whoever made the decision to cancel this show, whether it was up against a bigger hit (I don't even know what was on other channels in the same time slot), or what, ought NOT to be working in TV programming.  I will have to get by watching this one season, over and over.  It's that good, but I sure would have liked to have more than one season to enjoy.",1259280000,29,713,4.130434782608695
3903361,5,B002C3GTLC,Last season's Worst Week was an instant favorite in our house. We watched the entire season and each week we looked forward to the new episode. This turned out to be a real sleeper and a real winner. We hope to see a new season in the future.,1258243200,9,242,4.0625

3903433,5,B002C3GTLC,"I didn't know this show was based on a UK series, but usually the funniest shows are. This show took on a personal side for me. The guy who plays Sam reminded me of a boss named Dan I once had who looked similar to Kyle Borneimer, though not nearly as good looking. He was such a doofus, and had a really stupid sense of humor. Every time I watch this show I just picture him doing all of these stupid things that Sam does and it just makes it ever more funnier. This show never really got much promotion and was always on a sporadic schedule on TV, so not too many people know about it. Kurtwood Smith's role is not that much different than the one in That 70's Show. He is the grumpy dad who always wonders what is going to happen to him next, and it always does thanks to Sam. The wife played by Nancy Lenehan always tries to have faith in Sam to do the right thing, but something always happens to him. Meanwhile his fianc Melanie played by Erinn Hayes just can't believe the predicament that Sam always seems to get in.",1398038400,2,1024,4.150753768844221

What a great show! Why did such a great show last only one season?  I don't even know what

3903455,5,B002C3GTLC,I loved this show while it was on air. It's one of the rare shows that I'm happy to watch over and over again. I love sharing with friends that didn't catch it while it was live.,1396569600,2,178,3.8378378378378377
3903456,5,B002C3GTLC,This is the best TV series ever.  VERY funny.  I think they built up to where there is no where left to go which is why it only lasted one season.  It is even better than the British version.,1396224000,2,191,3.8461538461538463
3903457,5,B002C3GTLC,Gave it five stars cause its super funny. Isn't for young kids though. Adult language and situations. Wish this show was still on TV.,1390867200,,133,4.583333333333333
3903458,5,B002C3GTLC,The funniest show ever-don't know why it went away. Just when you recover form side-splitting laughter something else goes wrong-you have to buy this-it is too much! Not for children-very adult themes-crushingly funny without being raunchy.,1386633600,2,240,5.694444444444445
3903459,5,B002C3GTLC,I only bought this show on DVD because I have been a huge fan of Kyle Bornheimer's work since Family Tools and Erin Hayes since Guys With Kids. The good rating is for Kyle Bornheimer and Erin Hayes but the show itself sucks.,1384819200,,224,4.232558139534884

3903465,5,B002C3GTLC,This is a hilarious series. It is rare an English comedy series is also done as an American comedy that the American version is better. This is absolutely the case here.,1376352000,2,169,4.483870967741935
3903466,5,B002C3GTLC,"I watched this when it on tv and loved it. I was telling my wife about it because she has a love/hate relationship with uncomfortable moments and this show is absolutely chocked full of that. I suppose the show didn't last long because you can only make so many mistakes and misunderstandings in one family before you just have to end it. If you liked Meet the Parents, you'll enjoy this, it's essentially the same thing but spread out in 30 min segments.",1374278400,2,455,4.493975903614458

3903468,5,B002C3GTLC,Great show with a great cast. Not sure if it was a mid-season replacement and never meant to run longer than one season but its hilarious.

3903470,5,B002C3GTLC,have not watched the dvd's yet but I am looking forward to watching them. (the show was one of the funniest and was not given a fair shake) The case looks great though and it was packed okay and it arrived at average speed.,1366848000,2,223,4.090909090909091

3903473,5,B002C3GTLC,"Not sure why good, funny sitcoms like this one get canceled and other dummy shows keep going. I watched this show hen it was on TV, but this DVD seems to have more episodes and they are just as funny as the ones I saw when this was on TV. :-)  if you want a good laugh at a guy's bad luck this is the show for you.",1361664000,2,314,3.6176470588235294
3903474,4,B002C3GTLC,"This show was a great idea, but only for about half a season. The pilot is definitely the best show, followed by a few more pretty funny shows and by the latter part of the season you get the sense that the writers were running out of ideas. In spite of all that, Sam's (Kyle Bornheimer) mishaps will make you laugh hysterically but are so unlikely they will force you to suspend common sense in order to enjoy them. In spite of all that, there was never an episode where we didn't laugh out loud. If you like accident prone sort of comedy, this is definitely the show for you. If the writers had more stamina, this would've been one of the best shows ever.",1358726400,,657,4.264

3903476,5,B002C3GTLC,"We loved this program when it aired on TV...my son couldn't wait for it to come on.  He was always scared he was going to grow up like Sam.  We even tease each other when we screw something up we say ""Way to go Sam"".
When I was looking for a gift to get him...just because...I searched Amazon and found this.  I had to get it.  We watched the entire series in two nights and laughed every minute.  His friends come over and he has them laughing while they watch!

3903479,4,B002C3GTLC,I liked this quirky show.  I never saw it on tv only bought it on a whim.  Fun show.  20 minutes each (which tells you there was a lot of commercials).,1336089600,,151,3.806451612903226
3903480,5,B002C3GTLC,"I had not heard about this show, so I had no expectations when my wife brought it home. She picked it up at our local video rental place for a crazy low price. Once we started watching, we could not stop. This show is hilarious! I highly reccomend it to anyone who needs a light hearted deep laugh. I wish there were a season 2 as it seems there is so much more untapped material. Either way, you can watch it over, and over again without it getting old.",1336003200,2,454,4.112359550561798
3903481,1,B002C3GTLC,"I bought this series based on the glowing reviews on Amazon and must say that I am more than disappointed, even though I only paid like 4 dollars for it.  I will be the first to admit that comedy is very subjective and it can be difficult to gauge what people like.  If you like the kind of comedy where people just do stupid things for no reason at all and keep digging themselves deeper and deeper in a hole by continuing with the same behavior, then you'll love it.  Seriously, the main character is a lazy man who has issues with just telling the truth, instead fabricating stories when there is no reason to and just making things worse.

The kind of comedy I like and that makes me laugh?  The IT Crowd, Death at a Funeral (the Frank Oz version), Bowfinger, Big Bang Theory, Better Off Ted....if you like the things I like, then you probably will not like this series.",1332374400,10,874,4.337423312883436
3903482,1,B002C3GTLC,"This was more a case of what if your characters were too stupid to see any consequences to their actions than what if everything went wrong. I won't publish any 'spoilers', but from the very beginning, the main character makes the wrong choice in every situation he's put in and there were no logical reasons as to why. We watched three episodes before it simply became unbearable. What a waste of time and money.",1329782400,6,413,4.594594594594595

3903489,5,B002C3GTLC,"The English version, titled ""The Worst Week of My Life"" was very funny, indeed, but this American remake is absolutely hilarious. Kyle Bornheimer carries off the role of the hapless fiance with superb comic timing and the rest of the cast, some of whom you'll recognize from previous work in sitcoms, is uniformly excellent, as is the writing. And, perhaps best of all, the series tells the story of an American couple's week before the wedding...and then ends, unlike many American series which go on and on, long after we've lost interest.",1301616000,4,541,4.891304347826087
3903490,5,B002C3GTLC,"I recently saw ""You Again"" at the box office and was reintroduced to Kyle Bornheimer, who played a small supporting part in the feature. It made me think about his series ""My Worst Week"" which aired on CBS until being cut from the airwaves.
""My Worst Week"" is possibly one of the funniest sitcoms I have ever watched. Sam Briggs (Kyle Bornheimer), is the hapless hero of this hilarious show, who is able to bumble eveything he comes into contact with. He does so in such a naive and special way that you can't help but feel sorry for him as he goes from one embarrassing situation to another without a moment in between. Sometimes his malady is contagious and affects all the people around him.
Mr. Bornheimer's timing is impeccable as he interacts with his girlfiend/wife, Melanie Clayton (Erinn Hayes,) and his ultra conservative in-laws Dick and Angela Clayton (Kurtwood Smith and Nancy Lenehan.)
This DVD contains all sixteen segments that were aired including the pilot and gave my girlfriend and I several hours of side-splitting laughter. Once you see the pilot you will be hooked. Best advice: watch the episodes in sequence.",1289952000,4,1133,4.845360824742268

There hasn't been a single family we've shared it with who hasn't absolutely LOVED it and laughed to the point of tears.

3903503,5,B002C3GTLC,"I didn't expect anything from this series - nothing at all, really, I was just bored, and it was available - but what I found was one of my favorite shows ever, right up there with Wonderfalls, Pushing Daisies, Coupling (UK, natch).  And, you know, within shooting distance of Arrested Development (a far shooting distance, granted, but come on...)  But of course it is nothing like them (but it is of course similar to the original UK series).  What this is is funny, pure and simple, and, better yet, it's good-natured, with a warm heart, big laughs, and an almost innocent quality, even as it invokes shades of There's Something About Mary, and movies of that ilk.

This is the essential quality of this show: there's no-one you can't like.  Only one that's even really iffy on that subject, if that.  And it's about time stories are written about love and good intentions (without overdoing it).  It's the easiest thing in the world to sit there and think how you're going to cause trouble for your hero, only to say, oh, the mean father, the cruel boss, the nosy neighbor.  Not here.  And that's where this show has its brains, by never taking the easy way out.

I don't want to invest this show with too many saintly qualities - it's just a sitcom, after all - but it doesn't feel forced, it makes you smile, it's compulsively entertaining.  And it's about the most common condition, the one all its viewers share:  we're all only human, right?  This is a show about ""nothing"", but the nothing that means everything to the people involved in it.  Not because they're snide, or bitter, or sarcastic.  But because their hearts are in the right place.

And yet not sappy!  That's an achievement right there.  How many good-natured sitcoms can really say that?  And what this one has going for it, it has going for it in spades.

An important note:  This show lasted just the one season.  But don't let that dissuade you - no, in fact, it sort of feels like that's the perfect length.  So just soak it in, and know that while it doesn't end with an air of finality (they could have easily segued into a second season), it still does end, appropriately.  No cliff-hangers.  Just smiles, and maybe even a willingness to dive right back in from the beginning.",1259712000,17,2258,4.571072319201995

I watched some episodes of both versions of the show to my boyfriend and we were both screaming at the awkward situations that the characters get into. being awkward, anxious, and uncomfortable in most social situations I have nightmares about these things happening to me, but it also helps to feel better about myself by comparison.",1475798400,,450,5.178082191780822
