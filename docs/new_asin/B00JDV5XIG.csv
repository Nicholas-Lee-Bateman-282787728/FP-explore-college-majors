8650080,5,B00JDV5XIG,"Lemonade Joe, or The Horse Opera (Czech: Limondov Joe or Kosk opera) is a 1964 Czechoslovak musical comedy film, directed by Oldich Lipsk and written by Ji Brdeka, based on his novel and stage play.

This is a brilliant Czechoslovakian parody filmed in an avant garde style and a terrific example of Czech New Wave. It is positively absurd, fanatical, and a hilarious assault on all conscious thought. This also makes it fantastic and fun. Think of it as a complete satire and parody of the typical clich American Western with a funny twist. The entire film centers on a clean-living, soft-drink-selling gunfighter who takes on a town full of whiskey-drinking cowboys.

It's also a satire on American capitalism and cultural imperialismvalues embodied by the soft drink Kolaloka, (crazy coke) the name of which is a clear parody of Coca Cola. Numerous scholars have commented on the film's multiple layers of thematic parody. The historian Peter Bischoff suggested that, while the film seems to parody the American capitalist system, it also functions as a thinly disguised critique of communism.

The academician Anik Imre noted that ""by ridiculing the racist and sexist framework of the Western genre,"" Lemonade Joe also implicitly satirizes the rigid ideology of the Soviet government in the 1960s. Lemonade-JoeThe cultural anthropologist Cynthia Miller concludes that the film ""both glorifies and mocks the wonders of capitalist enterprise, and in so doing, creates a meeting ground between Maysian [i.e. Karl May-like] celebration and contemporary Soviet denunciation of all things West."" We thought is was roll over funny and we absolutely loved it.

The director was inspired by silent comedy films and when watching you can see he clearly borrowed numerous silent film effects including film tinting, slow motion, and fast motion. Brdeka's experience as an animator, often in collaboration with Ji Trnka, led to several effects and ideas derived from animation being incorporated into the film, including animated smoke rings and dotted lines for bullet paths, freeze frames for dramatic effect, and even a reference to the Acme Corporation from the Looney Tunes cartoons.

In other words - so much is 'said' without even being said and a true movie buff will love it for this aspect especially. The film includes specific parodic tributes to Western silent film actors such as William S. Hart and Tom Mix, as well as ""singing cowboy"" stars like Gene Autry, Tex Ritter, and Fred Scott. The film also evokes numerous other films, including Louis Feuillade's silent film serials, the 1911 film Arizona Bill, and the works of John Ford, including My Darling Clementine. Tornado Lou's character suggests Marlene Dietrich's character in another classic Western film, Destry Rides Again, and Hogofogo is likely modeled on John Carradine's character in the 1939 film, Stagecoach.

The set is pretty awesome considering it's Barrandov studios which constructed the Stetson City facades. The location shooting was done near Karltejn Castle, in a rocky landscape that had been nicknamed ""Amerika"" since the nineteenth century for its similarity to the American West. They even used an authentic Smith and Wesson gun, used as a prop by Joe. It was borrowed from a local museum and restored especially for the film. Stories about the American frontier, such as those by Karl May and Jack London, had long been widely read in Central Europe. American Western films had been popular in Czech theatres throughout the history of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia, from its founding in 1918 until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939.  Then, during the occupation and throughout Joseph Stalin's control of the Soviet Union, Westerns were completely banned. But, in the early 1960s, during Nikita Khrushchev's De-Stalinization of the Soviet Union, Westerns began to reappear in Czechoslovakia (yay!), with films such as High Noon, The Big Country, and The Magnificent Seven being screened in theatres.

A special bonus is to listen to the voices of two of Czech Republic's most beloved singers, Karel Gott and Waldemar Matuska. Matuska also has a part in the film, playing the character Banjo Kid. In then called Czechoslovakia, it was the best-selling film of the 1960s.

One hint - the colored filter over the film making it a very 60's looking pop-art vision is stressful for the eyes. Limonadovy-Joe-DVD-CoverWe adjusted our TV setting to color saturation = 0 and watched in black and white and it was much better (and easier on the eyes) though the color effects are cool. Maybe watch it twice?

However you decide you watch, just make sure you do. This is the kind of movie to get the whole family together, make a huge bowl of popcorn and settle in for a night of laughter and fun. Adios for now...",1445904000,,4809,5.130268199233717
