8562111,5,B00B3L5OQU,"We bought this DVD with high expectations: I had friends who have bragged on this band and who had even claimed to enjoy these songs as much as their kids did. This DVD blew my expectations out of the water. I would have never anticipated what an integral part of our lives these songs have become. In the month or so we've had this DVD, we must have watched it close to fifty times (we watched it five times the first day!). This little band has blessed us, kids and parents alike, It is way too easy to sing these songs all day long and, while they are definitely set to pretty contemporary music, to see how quickly my young children have learned so many Bible verses is truly an amazing gift. I'm thankful for this DVD.",1412985600,3,723,4.2846715328467155
