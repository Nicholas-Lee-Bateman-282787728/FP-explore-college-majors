8419190,5,B0049PFP6G,"This movie is exciting, filled with high drama and a lot of shady dealings. It had me guessing almost to the end of the movie as to who was orchestrating this madness! The acting from all the actors was excellent. The movie also shows that you should keep your hands clean at all time - otherwise ""stuff"" will hit the fan. The movie deserves the award it received.",1291334400,2,364,4.367647058823529
