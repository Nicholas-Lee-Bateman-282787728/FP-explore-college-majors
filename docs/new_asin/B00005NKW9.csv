7947443,4,B00005NKW9,"This set is a double pack. The first video is a set of three Christmas Power Rangers episodes. The first is from Power Rangers Zeo, the second from Mighty Morph'n Power Rangers, and the third is from a straight to video show called Alpha's Magical Christmas. Neither of the episodes feature the zords or much action, but it is nice to see the Christmas spirit here. The acting is bad, but that's what Power Rangers was like at the time. Be grateful for the current Power Rangers.
The second video is entitled Power Rangers in 3D. It can be watched with the attached 3D glasses or not, take your pick! This video is basically two episodes of Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue edited together. They feature appearances from the Lost Galaxy Power Rangers. I was never a fan of Lightspeed Rescue but I loved Lost Galaxy, and bringing them together was a pretty darn good idea. A very good match-up and a great second video.
