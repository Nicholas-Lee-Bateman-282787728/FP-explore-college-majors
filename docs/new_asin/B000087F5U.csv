1828186,5,B000087F5U,"Okay, this performance of Donizetti's MARIA STUARDA doesn't feature Montserrat Caballe or Joan Sutherland or Sills or Leyla Gencer; but it does feature some very competent and in the case of Joseph Calleja, quite superior, artists who turn in a very satisfying performance. I have both the CD and the DVD edition, and while the several Caballe performances for me are without parallel, I find that each time I listen to this performance, I find more and more to enjoy. I recommend it, in both formats, highly.",1262908800,3,509,4.862068965517241
1828187,4,B000087F5U,"This opera has its exciting moments.  The garden scene is especially well done.  The staging is simple and dramatic.  It is particularly interesting to see the Donizetti theatre in Bergamo.  The costumes were gorgeous and most delightful.

Joseph Calleja as Leicester was one of the best performance I have ever seen. Ms. Remigio is a wonderful Stuarda. Her coloratura is similar to Callas and not as sweet as Pons or Sutherland.  But the standard for this role was set by Beverly Sills. If you had the honor of seeing her perform any Donizetti opera you would know why. Ms. Remigio sang  well but needed to more drama especially at the end.  The audience response told her that.
The other roles were sung beautifully. Ms. Ganassi was a good Elizabeth and complimented Ms. Remigio very well.  I would have loved to see the slap in the garden scene as was done at the New York City Opera.  Overall it is an excellent production well worth your time",1205366400,4,947,4.650602409638554
1828188,2,B000087F5U,"Main interest of this Maria Stuarda, taped at the Teatro Donizetti in December 2001, centers on the first available commercial traversal of the score's critical edition.  The autograph score, thought to be lost, was discovered in 1989, in of all places, Sweden. The booklet (a model of it's kind, containing a full Italian libretto, notes in multiple languages, photos and a synopsis) attributes one Anders Wiklund to the Casa Ricordi Critical Edition.  There are indeed numerous differences in several places throughout the score, in a departure from the by-now familiar version (derived from several, and supposedly ""corrupt"" sources) which has been used throughout the years in performance and recordings.  I do not have the resources to compare the two scores side-by-side, and since different versions seem to be used for every performance available in any format, would be a major undertaking; but a Donizettian, familiar with the music, can discern the diffrences easily on his own.  The most notable examples are that of Maria's cabaletta, ""Nella pace del mesto riposo,"" and  the final ""Ah! se un giorno da queste ritorte;"" both  melodically take different courses from the versions we're used to hearing. They're not necessarily better; just different.  I find myself preferring the final aria in its commonly heard incarnation, though; it strikes a more fatalistic and higher pitch of tragedy. However, the most striking variant is the finale to Act Two, after Maria has denounced Elisabetta as a ""vil bastarda.""  In many ways the passages are similar, but unlike the wide intervals of high emotions of the usual one we're used to hearing, this one appears to seethe on a much more restrained level.  It makes for a very interesting comparison, one which will depend on the taste of the listener.

  Alas, the performance itself as a whole leaves much to be desired. This opera needs strong performers and singers of exceptional bel canto skills, and they aren't to be found here.

  Sonia Ganassi is the strongest of all the principals, but that does not suffice to that of a sure recommendation.  To begin with, Ganassi, billed as a mezzo, has a rather soft-grained voice, not especially wide-ranging on either end; she has a tendency to tighten up on top, and to lack of firm core of chesty resonance on the bottom.  Elisabetta needs a forceful, powerful tone capable of strength in declamation, to most of all convey the flashing surges of imperious temperament inherent in the character's vocal writing.  For an example of what constitutes an ideal Elisabetta, one may turn to any of Shirley Verrett's live recordings to hear how the role should be sung and portrayed: Verrett's Queen is a vivid, larger-than-life creation, with personality for days, temperament to burn, and a vocal splendor which has rarely been encountered elsewhere.  Ganassi (looking uncannily like that of Bernadette Peters) here is simply too girlish in both her tone and countenance - an Adalgisa and Cenerentola parlayed into a royal monarch.

  Carmela Remigio, the Maria, is a poor contender for the role, perhaps the least convincing and vocally-ill equipped of all the commercial exponents.  The basic core of the tone is often quite beautiful, and at times can shimmer with the peculiar morbidezza singular to Italians.  But that tone is not backed with any serviceable or workable technique.  The first aria, the haunting ""O nube che lieve per l'aria ti aggiri,"" is plainly, gracelessly sung, no deft trills, turns or nuances etched into the vocal line.  Furthermore, Remigio has alarmingly bad breath support: the breaths are incorporated in the wrong places, and there are so many of them, that they break up the line, and all legato and impetus is lost.  The vibrato, like many young singers are won't to do, is produced by a quivering jaw, and the tone is often drained of color; moreover, the comfortable range is exceedingly narrow.  Particularly jarring is how hoarse, whispery and almost non-existent is Remigio's lower middle register.  In the crucial confrontation scene, the lack of any firm core to the middle of the tone renders it ineffective; some of the words are nearly inaudible.  This deficiency of a firmly centered tone seriously undermines the emotional pull of the majority of Maria's vividly written music. Worst of all though, Remigio, whether through her own devices or because of the direction, enacts no semblance of a royal figure.  Plainly costumed and coiffed, Remigio looks instead like a young lady-in-waiting.  Her denunciation to Elisabetta is more like a schoolgirl finally telling off her nasty teacher instead of it being Queen to Queen.  There's plenty of that noticeable, determined sincerity throughout, but it does not make up for having no regality, no royal dignity or even depth and maturity to be found in this portrayal, and it leaves an emotional void to the very end.  Maria's final moments, which should be overwhelming, has no gradual elevation of tragedy, and it fails to move - a vacuous, empty, uncharismatic performance.

  The Leicester, Joseph Calleja, has a beautiful tone and a winning manner, and the Talbot, Riccardo Zanellato, gruff of tone and bearing, do well, but it hardly matters in the face of its ineffective principals.  The conductor, Fabrizio Maria Carminati, interviewed

in one of the ""Special Features"" offerings, speaks of his devotion to the score, and he certainly demonstrates that affinity through a beautiful orchestral reading.  But it does not make up for an ineffective and ""incomplete"" cast.

  The scenic tableau is made of of both ""traditional"" and comtemporary stylistic elements. During the prelude, the two protaganists are made to stand on either side of a big lop-sided grille dangling from the ceiling, pointing at each other, a bit like two lady boxers ready to square off; supposedly this is used to depict the emotional prisons in which the two queens exist.  The chorus too is made to sing from behind a grate/grille on the left side of the stage, but otherwise, the scenery has some intriguingly original and atmospheric ideas.  The camerawork is absolutely weird.  The performance seems to be captured on video, but some tampering has been made to the image quality - as though it were made to be grainy and perhaps more film-like. But how does one explain the rather jerky speed of the images? The sound is fine, but the picture seems to be a half-beat or so behind the aural aspects, lending an unsettling, almost psychedelic quality to it, as though your eyes were not working right.  Then there are the angles, and inappropriate shots of things - a hand, a foot, whatever, that has no direct bearing on the plot or story.  It's a mess.

  The disc is the most user friendly of all, though.  It has options for subtitles in 5 languages, several different audio aspects, and a chock-filled booklet.  If only it were all used to better purpose than this misguided release.",1173484800,16,6969,5.030514385353095
1828189,4,B000087F5U,"The singers are all very good, the sets interesting, etc. but there is a strange echo to the sound that almost makes you think the singers are not singing what you are hearing.  The performance is obviously miked from a great distance--audience sounds esp. at the end are quite amusing--but this has the effect of not letting us hear what we are seeing up close.  Film quality is poor--very grainy--they did not get special bright lighting for this performance.  But overall it is an exciting and moving rendition of the opera.",1095033600,13,527,4.769230769230769
1828190,5,B000087F5U,"What an excellent production of Maria Stuarda, with excellent singers all round. A wonderful Joseph Calleja at the beginning of his professional career, singing his music with consumate ease. Ganassi is fiery in acting, singing and in her portrayl of the Elizabeth. Remigio has a heavier voice that we are used to hearing in the title role, but it pays well, with the portrayl of the character. And no, it is not only the high notes that make or break the character, as sited by another reviewer. An excellent DVD on all fronts, with bonus features as well.",1092009600,7,557,4.6938775510204085
1828191,3,B000087F5U,"I was very disappointed in the singing in this opera, though I would like to say at the outset that the staging and camera-work were very interesting and modern, veering slightly toward the surrealistic or modern with the staging.  The scenery was simple and representative rather than realistic and lush.  There was some interesting camera-work with the duets, one image beside or overlapping the other, when the singers were on opposite sides of the stage.  Neither soprano went for the high notes (as did Sutherland on her CD), not even Maria's last note in the opera, she sang down.  That was, frankly, a big drag, and I felt cheated, and cheated retroactively.  It made me unhappy with the whole thing, and now what do I do with this expensive DVD?  I really doubt I'll ever watch it again.  This DVD reminded me of the small live CDs of Donizetti operas I've acquired a collection of, it was about that caliber, except that on my little Italian CDs, I think the singing is usually better.  This singing was not bad, let me hurry and say that, Leicester and Elizabetta were both very good, as was Talbot.  It just didn't seem to have the beauty and versatility and pizz-azz and (frankly) acrobatics that I've come to associate with Donizetti and (except for the acrobatics) with the opera composers I love (namely Puccini and Verdi).",1090281600,9,1338,4.732758620689655
7979508,3,B000087F5U,"One, that is Ganassi.  Cedolina is an attractive woman and a very mediocre singer.  I've been through this and the Antonacci/Devia DVDs and the Sutherland recording this weekend.  Out of three recordings, one great soprano (Sutherland, defects noted but great nonetheless), one very very fine mezzo (Ganassi) and Pavarotti just out of this world, that leaves two mediocre sopranos, one middling mezzo (Antonacci), one freaky woman (Tourangeau-- it's as if she's saying ""look, I've found the oddest and most unattractive sound that I can make and nobody else does this"" for which we can only be grateful-- she's quite bizarre).  Two puny tenors and the great Pavarotti who finally shows us that there is music here to be sung.  The Fenice conductor is good, by the way.  Why this opera is so difficult to put together I'm not sure.  But beware the admirers of Devia and Cedolina, they're blowing smoke.",1428796800,,901,4.966666666666667

7979512,5,B000087F5U,"Donizetti's opera Maria Stuart is based on Schillers version, where Elizabeth and Mary are seen to be in love with the Earl of Leicester and have an angry encounter(never happened). Commissioned for the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. It is suspected that following a dress rehearsal the singers  playing Elizabeth and Mary came to blows so absorbed were they in their parts. The royal patrons stepped in to stop the opera being performed. A year later it resurfaced at La Scala, Milan. A revival of this opera 20 years after Donizetti's death formed the basis of the opera when rediscovered in 1958. A newer version is the one chosen for this production which opened in April 2009 at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice. It had burned down in 1996 and was restored.

For Denis Krief stage director etc,the work is a psychodrama,a love triangle and he uses colour to signify ideas,the yellow of jealousy,deep blue of purity. The final scene is bathed in red. The staging is a maze which changes colour via lighting. For those who are traditional minded the scenery does not get in the way. The Orchestra del Teatro La Fenice is conducted by Fabrizio Carminati with swift tempo which brings out the lovely melodies. Elizabeth is the Mezzo Sonia Genassi who plays the part with emotion and is believable in the part. Fiorenza Cedolins sings Mary. She has built her reputation in Verdi and Puccini roles,for example the Tosca held in Verona open air theatre.(bluray) She is excellent. In this part she captures the emotion and drama in this opera Maria Stuarda. Jose Bros, the Spanish tenor is Count of Leicester and holds his own with Genassi and Cedolins. Talbot is Mirco Palazzi. The Italian audience is typical of the species. You have to go to a opera in that country to understand what I mean. Throughly recommended.

7979513,4,B000087F5U,"This production of Maria Stuarda is interesting in that the set is non-traditional - it consists of mazelike structures colored by lighting, portions of which are movable, representing the intrigue and circuitous paths that the various characters move through while attempting to get what they want.  Central, of course, are Elizabeth (played by Sonia Ganassi), and Maria Stuarda (Queen of Scots, played with depth by Fiorenza Cedolins), each of whom possesses a strong personality and absolute sense of ""this is how things should be"".  And as any Donizetti opera lover knows, Maria does not win this particular competition.

However, the dialog and drama between the two, as well as the interplay between Roberto and Giorgio, make for a fine dramatic feast.  Ms. Cedolins shows a range of emotion ranging from incense to vulnerability to pride in sense of self.  As Lord Guglielmo Cecil, Marco Caria does a fine job as the manipulator of the interaction between Elizabeth and Leicester, who loves Maria and does his level best to convince Elizabeth to meet with Maria in the hope that she can be convinced to free her.

While it can be argued that Maria Stuarda is the weakest of Donizetti's trilogy of bel canto operas on Tudor queens, the palpable jealousy and hatred between Ganassi's Elizabeth and Cedolins' Maria makes for a wonderful operatic feast.  This production proved itself to be a worthy addition to this opera lovers Donizetti collection.",1318204800,,1454,5.084033613445378
7979514,4,B000087F5U,"Who is Krief? He is the guy who is overall in charge of what happens on stage with the thankful exception of the music. Thank heavens for such mercies.

If one wants to 'see' what Anachronism means, they only have to see the Stage Direction, Sets and Lighting Design of this otherwise great production of Maria Stuarda.

Whatever I want to comment on the singing, conducting and sound and video etc has already been elucidated beautifully by the two persons who wrote the comments ahead of me, Keris Nine and Dr. Rippon. They are on the dot.

I want to really comment on the Staging.
There is nothing imaginative here. The whole thing looks like a maze or labyrinth through which the actors scamper about like rats. It represents nothing... not even the so called 'trap' that both the ladies are supposed to be in. Ultimately it slides and exposes what looks like an exoskeleton of some monster or just plain scaffolding prior to concreting a slab of a construction work in progress. The lighting - less said about it the better.
I don't know who did the acting direction, but that seems to come a cropper too, with the two women being pawed and almost fondled (?) at scenes and sequences that in no way point to any kind of even abstract eroticism or whatever these guys were trying to portray.

Krief is, according to me, guilty of almost single-handedly ruining this production with his antics. He seems to be trying to be different for the sake of being different and cannot come up with anything better. If this is the face of what is supposed to be 'intellectual', then sorry, I am an Idiot.

I don't think I am the only one who has this opinion.
Just see the top of the back cover of this very disc,wherein, unwittingly or not, the producer of the inlay cover has printed a small comment from the Frankfurt Allegemeine Zeitung about this disc, which coyly states ""To conjure up ...hatred and jealousy, you don't need a stage setting, just two splendid Prima Donnas""... oh how I love the double meaning in that.

To tell you the truth, if all actors had been on an empty stage with a blank curtain background, the whole production could have been, in comparison, even deemed 'brilliant' insofar as staging is concerned. After all, there is not too much 'acting' involved and that seems to suit Jose Cura quite well - he is no actor.

BUT

I would still recommend this blu ray disc to anyone. The singing is simply divine. The orchestra is lively although sometimes overpowering (in the opening chorus, you can barely hear the chorus). Honestly, I did enjoy tremendously everything except what I have written above, and I do not think we are going to get hold of another Maria Stuarda of this quality of cast, chorus and orchestra for a long time.",1302048000,5,2752,4.590631364562118
7979515,4,B000087F5U,"The previous reviwer has already noted that this is a ""psycho"" drama between two ""ladies"" and a dull-witted tenor in a Schiller play that has no connection to historical veracity. That said we can turn to the battle of the sopranos. Sonia Ganassi belted out an Elizabeth in a DVD made at Bergamo in 2001. Her rival that time was Carmela Remigio as Maria Stuarta. Remigio simply does not have the voice or the technique to carry off the blazing confrontation scene or the quiet, noble, final prayer. Ganassi in a quieter portrayal than the present one easily came off the winner. It should be noted that the tenor in that production was Joseph Calleja who looked the part and sang the part exceptionally well. In the present recording Ganassi is again in top form and is even more on spot while singing the blazes off everyone else on stage. The Maria is Fiorenza Cedolins. She comes with a reputation in standard Italian repertoire of which I've heard a few selections. Thus I was looking forward to her confrontation scene. I was sorely disappointed. Under stress her voice became strident, wobbled and slipped off key to a shrill yelp. Her previous ""Oh, nube! che lieve per l'aria t'aggiri"" usually a show-stopper, was disappointing also. What happened? Then came the final scene where she finally had her voice under control. So her final prayer was her best singing and was in parts quite beautiful. However Ganassi had won again in this La Fenice of Venice 2010 DVD. It should be noted that in neither performance did the ladies act very queen-like or carry off any semblance of dignity. For that you need to watch the Mary Stuart of Janet Baker and the Elizabeth of Rosalind Plowright. Both were every inch a Queen and the dramatic tension was palpable. Certainly the real Queens wouldn't have allowed the heavy petting of the tenor on both the ladies as seen in the present disc. The tenor in this DVD is Jose Bros who can sing but is short and round like a panting spaniel at the feet of the queens. Since there was no gesture toward historical settings (even the quill for the death warrent was a BIC) the setting was interesting. It consisted of a very complicated maze that represented the psychological barriers that all the people on stage had to face in life. Interesting, yes, but I'll take my period dramas in period decor. History is history.",1300665600,11,2359,4.686746987951807
7979516,4,B000087F5U,"One might expect a certain amount of historical detail and political intrigue in an opera about the English crown during the turbulent Tudor era but, based on a play by Friedrich Schiller, Donizetti's Maria Stuarda, like many of his bel canto historical works, keeps the plot and the psychology relatively simple, relating to it more on a romantic than a political level.  Here, the political element is practically non-existent, the rivalry that lies between Mary Queen of Scots and Elizabeth being for the affections of the Earl of Leicester, and the dominant tone - powerfully stated - is one of the deepest jealousy.

""Is she pretty?"", Elisabeth can't help herself asking Leicester who has just delivered a message from Mary and has shown indifference to the news that she is considering a marriage proposal from France, and you can imagine her reaction when Leicester has the indelicacy of detailing Mary's virtues in loving tones while, strangely in this production, his hands are wandering all over her.  The latter point highlights the problem that Denis Krief has with staging the opera.  There is really no action, the characters just stand around and sing, and with no great depth to the love-triangle rivalry, the stage director is left to just emphasise, and in some cases inappropriately overstate, those surface emotions that are brought out in the libretto.

The opera works well on that surface level, but it's mostly through its expression in Donizetti's simple but sizzling score and the delivery of those bitter cat-fighting moments in the extraordinary challenging arias, more than through anything that the staging comes up with. There may not be much to get to grips with in the plot, the acting is stiff and weak (mainly on account of the characters having nothing to do), but if you want to see a mezzo and a soprano tear strips off each other vocally, and coming close to physical violence (there are looks that could kill here), then Sonia Ganassi as Elizabeth and Fiorenza Cedolins as Mary, deliver that in the most powerful manner. Inevitably, the soprano is going to win in the singing stakes, Cedolins having plenty of extravagant arias with all the coloratura, and she delivers them with remarkable control and force, but Ganassi's Elizabeth has the more juicy lines in the libretto and devastating put-downs. Coming between these two powerful women, the thin tenor voice of Jos Bros can't help but seem a bit lost, hitting the notes well enough, but with a tone that isn't the most pleasant to the ear.

If a stage director is wise then, he will also just keep out of the way and let the two women get on with it, and to a large extent that's what Krief does.  There is no period setting, the costumes are generic traditional rather than modern, there are practically no props whatsoever, the stage converted into a tilted forward labyrinth (reminiscent of the Berlin Holocaust memorial or, less kindly, like a Pac-Man arena when it is populated by moving characters) that does nevertheless give emphasis to the romantic intrigue through its lighting and shadows.  It's not particularly imaginative or dynamic, but it looks fine and works through its very simplicity.  There's not much drama then, no real staging to speak of, not much in the way of acting or movement - it might as well be a concert performance - but the opera works through its musical vibrancy and some terrific arias alone.

On Blu-ray, the stage setting and the lighting come across exceptionally well, and the audio tracks are just as impressive, voices ringing clear, the orchestration beautifully defined, the strings in particular being dominant, with deep rounded bass in the low-frequency range.  The audience however sounds strangely muted in the surround mix.  There is a little bit of ambient noise or low microphone feedback on a few moments, but nothing that affects the overall impact.  There are no extra features on the disc, just some brief notes on the opera and its staging, with a similarly short synopsis.",1299628800,2,4029,4.9423076923076925
