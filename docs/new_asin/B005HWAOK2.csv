8473801,5,B005HWAOK2,"I give this archive Atomic Rooster DVD a five-star for it's first half of the disc alone. First five songs feature - the one - the only - the much under-appreciated John DuCann on lead vocals and guitar. Couldn't get enough of the live August, 1970 show presented here with the power-house ""Save Me"" (perhaps one of the most color videos I have ever seen), the awesome ""Sleeping For Years"", ""VUG"", the ass-kicking ""Tomorrow Night"" and their thirteen-minute monster early '70's heavy hitter (almost worth the price of admission, alone). Next segment is from February, 1972 with Chris Farlowe as the group's front-man. Several old fans have repeatedly told me that they do not care too much for Farlowe. But to be fair here - the soulful vocalist and the rest of the band certainly appears to be enjoying themselves as well as putting their all into this Beat Club performances which feature ""Breakthrough 1"" and the so-so ""Black Snake 2"". Honestly, a must-own.",1393977600,5,959,4.853658536585366
