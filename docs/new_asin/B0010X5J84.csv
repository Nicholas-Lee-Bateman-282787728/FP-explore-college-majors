8238949,3,B0010X5J84,"The only thing I knew about this author was that he made the pianist in ""Shine"" go crazy.  This work NEVER states that his piano compositions were too complex or could make a person insane.
The work stresses how he was received as a pianist compared to how he was received as a composer.  The showed his name spelled in Russian and from what little I've learned of Russian, his last name does not have that ""CH"" in it.  I wonder how and when it got Anglicized like that.
This work said he had major depression when his first symphony bombed.  It also said being a husband and father helped to uplift his spirits.  I wonder if those who battle depression could learn from his life.
Too often, many like to divorce art from politics.  Since this was a Russian artists living around the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, I was worried that they would avoid politics just to be nicey-nicey.  However, they do take it there.  They do mention the artist's pride in his heritage even as he fled his home country to skip out on Soviet demands.",1208304000,4,1035,4.439153439153439
