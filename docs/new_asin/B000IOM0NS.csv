 Beginning with September 12, 1973, Dr. and Mrs. Del-zio want a baby but must resort to egg-harvesting for the first attempt at In-vitro Fertilization (IVF); the egg is delivered to the lab of Dr. Landrum Shettles. The program then flashes back to the 1930's research with rabbit IVF. John Rock [of fame in developing the birth control pill but this is not mentioned] conducted early experiments and achieved the first fertilized embryo in 1944 but his work with IVF ends when his skilled lab assistant moved away. Shettles pursues human IVF despite objections of his boss. But Edwards and Steptoe in the UK research IVF at a faster pace.  Ethicists, including Art Caplan, explain social concerns of the time. The U.S. NIH places a moratorium on funding IVF research. Columbia Presbyterian warns and demotes Shettles, but he continues his research in defiance.

In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Roe versus Wade.  Embryo research becomes intermingled with social debates on ""when does life begins"" [not actually a biological debate since life never ends across generations; the real question has evolved today to ""when does legal personhood begin""]. Mrs. Del-zio describes the agony of infertility. In a return to the opening scene, Shettles boss orders the destruction of Shettles incubating IVF experiment. Shettles is forced to resign. The Del-zios bring a lawsuit against Shettles' boss. The Edwards and Steptoe decade-long attempt to produce a successful IVF baby finally results in the birth of a healthy baby girl on July 25, 1978, in the midst of the trial. This news exonerates IVF as dangerous and experimental. The Del-zios win the case but receive a minimal award. Shettles' career is never restored.

President Reagan continues the no-government-funding-for-embryo-research policy, forcing research to remain overseas and driving U.S. IVF practice into the private sector. Meanwhile, Drs. Howard and Georgeanna Jones who are entering retirement decide to establish an IVF clinic in 1980; he describes a year of failures before the first IVF baby is born. Excellent brief discussion of some of the technical problems is provided, including use of hormones to stimulate several ovulations at the same time. Judy Carr becomes the first U.S. IVF baby (in spite of worries for the worse). A photo of 115 IVF babies from the Jones Clinic in 1985 is impressive. At the time this video was made in 2006, over 400,000 IVF babies had been born.  The program concludes with additional discussion of societal questions; the science however is clear.

 For science teachers, this program provides excellent illustrations, with first hand testimony from many of the scientists involved, of the nature of this science. -That oftentimes, the first researchers in a field face condemnation and work against prevailing social norms, and out of compassionate concern for their patients. -That the U.S. was not a leader in this research (and still remains a backwater in reproductive technologies).  -And that scientists do not always win or live happily every after.",1355702400,2,3153,5.238095238095238
8146953,3,B000IOM0NS,"I had no knowledge whatsoever about the history of IVF, so I couldn't be critical of this documentary generally.  I am glad that the documentary makers decided that IVF need ed to be a part of the ""American Experience.""

From one baby in the late 1970s, now 2.5 million people worldwide owe their lives to IVF.  Because this procedure lacks controversy now, to some, this work may seem dated.  However, this settled debate may remind many nowadays of the controversy over stem cell research.  This documentary suggests that the US and Britain were in a race to see who could successfully perform IVF first; this reminded me of the race in AIDS research between the US and France, as described in ""And the Band Played On.""

This film repeatedly spoke about couples who wanted children, but oftentimes, individuals were interviewed separately.  I wonder if many of the interviewed couples have divorced since they requested IVF.

I guess I have one critique.  Issues of class were not brought up.  I hear IVF is still INCREDIBLY expensive.  I assume that only rich couples have it as an option though the procedure is available.  If the documentary makers wanted to be thorough, they would have brought this up.",1163462400,5,1209,4.84390243902439
