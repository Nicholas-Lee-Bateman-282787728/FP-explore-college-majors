1692283,5,B000063V8U,"It's Star Trek The Next Generation, what more needs to be said ? Now available on blu ray as well",1039478400,,97,3.9
1692284,5,B000063V8U,"""Relics"", ""Tapestry"", ""Rascals"", ""True Q"" are just SOME of the great episodes you'll find in this series. Truly an impressive season!",1039132800,,133,5.380952380952381
1692285,5,B000063V8U,"This season of Star Trek-The Next Generation is fabulous entertainment. It is very strong storytelling, the characters gain more depth than one could have hoped for. Picard is tormented by the Cardassians in the two-part-episode ""Chain of command"", possibly the second most notable ordeal in the whole series follwing his first one with the Borg. We get to see ""Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott"" from the original series again in the episode ""Relics"", who is suspended for about 75 years in a transporter-buffer. This episode is a fine example for how a transitional episode involving a cast member from the original series is done, because the story is about remembrance. Surely this episode invoked tears in some of Star Trek oldest fan-communities. The episode ""Schisms"" is sort of ""Twilight Zone""-like, crew members are abducted and medically examined by aliens from another universe or dimension. It has a nice creepy element to it and an ending wihtout many hints or explanations. Prof. Moriarty returns with an elaborate plan to finally exit the holodeck and entering the real world in a very cleverly made episode. ""Face of the Enemy"" features thrill and excitement with Troi posing as a Romulan to assist the Romulan underground movement saving some important high dignataries. The cliffhanger once again sets the crew up against their relentless enemy, the Borg. This episode is very entertaining and thrilling, but one has to admit it would have worked maybe as well with another species of cybernetic or robotic lifeform as it did with the Borg. The first two appearances of the Borg brought a quality and richness to them as never reached again in any future-episodes with them, be it 'Next-Gen' or 'Voyager'. At least in 'First Contact' the feeling of what they were and represented is brought back to life, when Picard is faced with his ultimate nightmare-experience with them. But in the end I have nothing but high praise for this season showing once more what good fiction can be.",1036627200,10,1991,5.036363636363636
1692286,5,B000063V8U,"This season has several of TNG's best episodes. Beginning with the conclusion to Times Arrow, Frame Of Mind, Ship In A Bottle, Tapestry, and Fistful Of Datas, the sixth season offers a wide range of creative thought. And in the middle of this creativity you find the two part Chain Of Command, which showcases the excellent acting ability of Patrick Stewart like no other episode. Jonathan Frakes in Frame Of Mind and Brent Spiner in Fistful of Datas also get the chance to expand their respective ranges. In Frame Of Mind, Riker is seen as something other than the cool, unflappable first officer. In Fistful of Datas, Data plays multiple holodeck characters most excellently. The only season I would rank higher than season six would be season seven.",1030752000,,752,4.8828125
1692287,5,B000063V8U,"The best season of Trek was, by far, the sixth.  IT has the second half of Time's Arrow, which is an episode that scored an Emmy for the Next Generation series.  It has two two-part episodes, one of which is Chain of Command, which is not only a well-acted episode involving Cardassian brutality, but also quite subversive.  Tapestry was, easily, one of the greatest episodes to involve Q.  Rascals was a memorable episode in which some of the crew gets turned back into children via a transporter accident.  And after all of this, it ends with Descent!  A Star Trek version of World War II that uses Lore as Hitler, and Data as a sort of Mussolini with a cluster of renegade ""free-thinking"" borg under their command.  If you save your money for just one TNG gift set, make it this one!",1030406400,16,786,4.492957746478873
1692288,4,B000063V8U,"Although not the best season of TNG, it contains some of the best episodes: Schisms, Chain of Command (""There are four lights!""), Tapestry (Q as God), Frame of Mind, and Timescape.
Plus, you get Star Trek's version of Die Hard in Starship Mine.
What more can you ask?",1022803200,5,267,4.583333333333333
1692289,5,B000063V8U,"Season 6 of Star Trek the Next Generation has many middle of the road episodes with a few really strong thrillers and character episodes. Chain Of Command (with the superb David Warner from ""Titanic"" ""The Omen"" and other Star Trek episodes / films) deals with the capture and torture of Picard by the Cardassians while a new captain takes command of the Enterprise much to Riker's distain. The other 2 parter, ""Birthright"" is a wasted opportunity to integrate with Deep Space Nine. The 2 shows ran concurrently for 2 years yet once twice did they attempt to cross over. We really wanted to see a 3 or 4 parter with all the Next Gen / DS9 crews in the same story. ""Birthright"" has the Enterprise docked at DS9 while Worf spends yet another episode dealing with his family and honour.
There are less of the great episodes that we've been used to from the 3rd to 5th seasons. Face of the Enemy, Starship Mine, Second Chances, The Chase and Timescape are all good if somewhat contrived. Descent features the return of the individual Borg faction led by Data's brother Lore. It's not strong enough as a Borg episode, the feeling of them being invincible has gone from ""Q Who"". Every time Star Trek faces a new, deadlier enemy, several episodes later they are made out to have human values after all - which isn't the point.

1692311,3,B000063V8U,"This was really a hit-or-season for me. Some of the episodes were just fantastic, such as ""Chain of Command"" and ""Birthright"", as well as the fascinating searies finale with Lore, but there are some genuine turkeys here as well, such as ""Rascals"" (Picard as a young kid), ""Fistful of Datas"" (is the holodeck really that prone to error? It's been 6 seasons now and the thing is always messing up! The series really opened with some weak episodes, like the weird Troi aging, or the one with Lt. Barclay, who just seemed to be the token neurotic annoying guy. There were some decent episode but a few you really have to struggle to get through.",1495756800,,641,4.582608695652174

1692313,5,B000063V8U,"Once again, the image quality on the Blu Ray is first rate! The Season 6 episodes are among the most oft-repeated on TV, so I got kind of bored, but the extras on each disk were all great. Personally, I found the Riker psychobabble episode 'Frame of Mind' the most annoying and skipped over it. 'Aquiel' was almost as bad, skipped that as well. Lavar Burton is out of his element as a romantic lead. But, they're still better than anything you see on TV now!",1488412800,3,458,4.337209302325581

Here, we have more dealings with the Cardasians, more Borg and DS-9 was introduced (later to become the setting for probably my favorite Trek Series, Deep Space 9).  Not sure if I'm just thinking with my nostalgia hat on, but since I've started catching up on TNG, beginning with season 1, this series is even better than I remembered.  There are the occasional stupid episodes (the less Wesley Crusher the better), some that just shouldn't have been made, perhaps, but overall an excellent, exciting season.
Whether you're new to Star Trek TNG, or want to re-live the series like me, I heartily recommend doing so.  Excellent series.",1475539200,,709,4.883333333333334

Not much of an official editorial review here from Amazon. But then again what else is there really left to add. Star Trek has given us fans so much throughout the decades, and 29 years after this series premiered its still immensely enjoyable. The episodes never get old and with Christmas sales I was able to finish the run. The inserts to this 7disc DVD release offer the following product description;
----------

In season six of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the dangers grow even more dire for the crew of the Enterprise. During a behindthelines mission, Captain JeanLuc Picard (Patrick Stewart) falls into the hands of a seasoned Cardassian torturer. In an attempt to learn the truth about his father, Worf (Michael Dorn) breaks into a Romulan prison compound. James Doohan returns when a transporter malfunction resurrects the original series Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott. Riker (Jonathan Frakes) copes with a bizarre identity crisis that pits him quite literally against himself. And Datas (Brent Spiner) quest to understand emotion introduces him to the concept of rage.

My total favorites are 1001... (Minuet) in Season One, Half a Life (might be in Season 6), Preemptive Strike (Season 7), Tapestry, The Inner Light, The Perfect Mate. I don't sort them out by season.
I just watched an interview with Patrick Stewart by William Shatner. It is incredible that they thought The Next Generation would not last - a bald English actor after Captain Kirk! But I remember my own reaction and that of my daughters at the time. No way! But Captain Picard stood his ground, and as a man, I think he aged much better than William Shatner. Sometimes I wish I did not have to see Shatner in those crazy ads. Start Trek is the greatest show ever, and I thank Gene Roddenberry every day for it.  Susan.",1446076800,,894,4.228070175438597

In this episode, acting on bad intelligence which later turns out to be completely false, the Federation, under the command of a thoroughly incompetent general, enters into a conflict of choice (not of necessity) with the Cardassians, relieves Captain Picard of command of the Enterprise, and places in command of the Enterprise an utterly inept officer to lead the mission.  Meanwhile, Picard is sent on a foolish spy mission in search of ""weapons of mass destruction"", but finds none, gets captured by the Cardassians, and is subjected to, shall we say, ""enhanced interrogation techniques.""  The Cardassians don't get any useful intelligence out of Picard.  Sound familiar??  The most fascinating aspect of this episode is that it first aired in December 1993 - well before 9/11, the Patriot Act, and the U.S. invasion of Iraq.",1444953600,,897,5.158620689655172

1693278,5,B000063V8U,"Star Trek: The Next Generation (frequently abbreviated as ST:TNG) was controversial at the time of its release. Many people announced that they would boycott TNG because it did not star the old cast or because it did not use the same characters. Even William Shatner was against the new series, and in interviews, described the problems that the new cast was facing that never faced to old cast.

What is ST:TNG? It is, as the next generation (or at least several generations later) after the original Star Trek (ST:TOS). It is 75 years later. Technology is better. The ship is the 1701D, three ships later than Kirk's original 1701 and 1701A. Originally, we know nothing about what happened to the 1701B or 1701C. So, if 25 years is one generation in an average family, and each ship letter is a generation, this new series could have been called,

STAR TREK: THREE GENERATIONS LATER

Peace has broken out between the Federation and the Klingons, though there are occasional problems. We now see that, just like the Federation includes many people who look different from each other, so does the Klingon federation, as we see a new race of Klingons (that require much more makeup than the original Klingons).

Continuity is still a problem. Events in later seasons do not necessarily logically follow events in earlier episodes. For example, in one episode, one-half impulse power might allow the ship to move slowly out of the ship's berth at spacedock, while in another episode, one-half impulse power might be a significant fraction of the speed of light. But ST:TNG does do a better job with continuity than TOS or ""Enterprise"", but not as good as in Deep Space Nine (ST:DS9) or Voyager (ST:V)

All in all, ST:TNG deserves all five stars in spite of the lacks I describe, but it is not the best science fiction show of its kind. No matter how much I love TNG (and Star Trek in general), I love ""Babylon 5"" even more. It had a five year story line that was planned out 100% in advance, planned out very logically I must say. If you have never seen it, please give it a chance, but when you do, start with ""Season One"" -- do not start with ""In the Beginning"" or the other prequel. Do an Internet search on ""Babylon 5 viewing order"" to figure out what order to watch it in.

I highly recommend Star Trek, not only Season Six, but all seven seasons.",1443312000,3,2350,4.610047846889952
1693279,5,B000063V8U,"I've been a big fan of the series since I was a kid. Watching it again has been just as wonderful as seeing it for the first time.

1693479,4,B000063V8U,"The reason I sought out this episode of Star Trek TNG; season 6, #20 ""The Chase"" had nothing to do with Star Trek. One day I was reading about Linda Thorson, who was in the old Avengers TV series. I remember she was one nice cookie. I happened to see that she acted in a Star Trek chapter. She played a Cardassian (spelling?). through all the heavy make up you could see it was her. The episode was pretty good, rather thoughtful, with a novel idea. A large number of the humanoid species of our galaxy have a single origin source. So Earth, Klingon, Romulus among other are all related. This idea pisses off everyone except Picard who must take the moral high ground. Capt. Kirk could not have done this show, no love interest... not even Ms. Thorson.",1438300800,,752,4.41726618705036

I wish the 'crew' behind these episodes were able to carry this level of story-telling to the big screen.  Unfortunately that did not happen.  I don't blame them for the failures of the big screen.

1. Tapestry (For my money THE definitive Patrick Stewart episode of the entire series run)
2. Frame of Mind (A play within a play within a play)
3. Time's Arrow, Part II (the season opener)
4. Starship Mine (Essentially Picard as Bruce Willis in ""DieHard"" but on the Enterprise)
5. Chain of Command, Parts 1 & 2. (A two-part episode that delves into a secret mission behind enemy lines and shows a pretty graphic scene of torture).",1433721600,,621,4.585585585585585

1693707,5,B000063V8U,"I bought all my seasons of the next generation from Amazon or so I thought. When my season 7 arrived I placed it on the wall with the others then realized I had accidentally missed buying season 6. So I rushed to the computer made sure it WAS season 6 and bought it b

The problem is when I carefully placed it on the wall I noticed it was standing out like a sore thumb. It was missing the outer sleeve. Now normally I'm not THAT picky but in the case it really looked out of place because the sleeves are bigger that the case and they are perfectly square too.

So I returned it and they sent me another. Low and behold IT was missing the sleeve as well. I also noticed that unlike the others that I paid around $80 for each this one was $45. I didn't notice that when I ordered it because I'm one of those people who do not look at the price tag. I just buy. (Sounds snobby but I'm not)

This time I called Amaxon and the representative said it said may NOT contain outer sleeve as shown in the picture. I apologized profusely. God I swear I did not see that but then again I don't look at the price tag either. She said to me ""oh don't apologize. It's not on the web site that way for you it's only in our notes to us when we look it up. In fact she said there were quite a few returns for the missing sleeve so she took it back refunded me (again) and said ""honestly there's no way to tell if another copy will arrive with a sleeve so I'm having them all pulled. You may want to buy it locally so you can see before you buy it if it has a sleeve or not"". That was nice of her.

So this is more a cautionary warning. If the outer sleeve is not that big a deal then Absxin has the lowest price and fastest delivery time. In fact they sent burnout and I had only just mailed the other back that morning. That was excellent customer service too!",1433030400,,1846,3.981081081081081

I love Season 6 of Star Trek The Next Generation. It's the most fun season of the series. It starts with the conclusion of the Season 5 cliffhanger where the crew travels back to 1890's San Francisco. Then later they meet up with Scotty, who's been trapped in a transporter loop for 75 years. Data and Troi get stuck in the Old West during a Holodeck malfunction. This season is big on ""old timey"" storylines. Plus there are plenty of great episodes dealing with the Romulans and Cardasians.

Top to bottom it's just my favorite season of the entire series.

As for the digital presentation on the Amazon FireStick......it makes the show worth rewatching. The print is cleaned up and looks fantastic. It's not HD because the show wasn't shot in HD originally. It's still presented in a 4:3 frame (black bars on the sides of a modern widescreen TV). But it's cleaned up so it's a crisp clear image like you've never seen. Additionally the special effects have been enhanced with more modern technology available to add a sense of realism to the space scenes. This is done in a positive way, not a ""Let's make Greedo shoot first and add a bunch of CGI Banthas everywhere"" way. Nothing is really 'changed' about the special effects, just cleaned up and enhanced a bit. It's the kind of clean up that should have happened to Star Wars. So don't worry about Trek being ruined by change It's not. It's actually made better.",1430006400,,1421,4.619047619047619

Some of the episodes are less Star Trek than they are other offerings.  We've a Wild West holodeck episode with Warf's soon, Alexander and an archeological expedition episode with Ole Baldy himself.  And speaking of him, he falls in love with a woman who turns out to be a red shirt owing to his orders.  Oops!

TNG 6 has something for everybody.  But that isn't necessarily a good thing.  While you can be great at a few things, it's very hard to be great at MANY things.  Season 6 proves just that.  In my opinion, and hardly anybody on Amazon listens to it, Star Trek should stick with what they know: aliens, killing and killing aliens.",1423958400,,783,4.575539568345324

1694095,4,B000063V8U,"My only objection to this release is that you have to go through so much 'crap' to actually get to the top level menu to watch episodes. I sort of expect that with movies but is is really annoying with a TV series. If you are going to have a marathon, I suppose it is ok, but if you watch an episode at a time, you will pull your hair out.. Even if you leave the disc in the player, most now hibernate after a certain period of time and CBS Splash screen that you can't skip through, A language selection (English is the default but you must choose one), Copyright statements that you can't skip through, and a DTS Splash screen that you can skip through.

I am encouraged by the characters' efforts to reach the fulfillment of their own meaning under the guidance of their captain. The vastness of space and time creates a great screen on which to depict their development and achievements. The lessons learned are timeless and in many instances foreshadow struggles that our time will be dealing with.  I do find it a bit disappointing to see how the societal values of the times in which the episodes are written influence the production choices. For example, views on a divine creator, or on the roles of men & women, or on racial prejudice are very much a part of the values prevalent at the time of an episode's production.",1419897600,,815,4.699300699300699

The episode is a sort of bottle episode, with Counselor Troi being the feature, and the rest of the cast playing very minor roles. However, unlike many of the Counselor Troi featured episodes, this episode does not focus on her as a counselor but rather as a star fleet trained officer. Seeing her adapt to the circumstances, and become aggressive and intimidating even to the Romulans shows an unnatural side to her that is both intriguing and entertaining to watch.

Also, the intimate knowledge given of Romulan society, inter-political disputes and opinions, and military technology, tactics, and command structure was some of the best and most detailed in all the series.

I'm buying each season in turn even though I already own them on either VHS or DVD (plus they're on Netflix and whatnot), because I want to reward the efforts of the team that painstakingly and faithfully remastered all these episodes.  I do wish they had REDONE some of the sillier effects like the team that remastered ST:TOS did, but I understand why they didn't; they wanted to stay faithful to the original material.  So really, no complaints.  All these blu-rays are just cleaner, more wonderful versions of all our favorite (and yes, occasionally cringe-worthy) episodes!

1694304,4,B000063V8U,"When Star Trek: The Next Generation's sixth season began production, it was a busy time for the franchise. A new spin-off series, Deep Space Nine, was about to launch and air alongside TNG. Plans were being made for a new film, one that would transfer the TNG crew to the big screen. It was also the first time that a season of Star Trek would be made without any input at all from Gene Roddenberry, who had passed away early in the production of the fifth season.

Despite a lot of outside issues, TNG's penultimate season is a bit of a triumph, certainly better than the inconsistent fifth season. Things do get off to a weak start with Time's Arrow, Part II which feels like someone had an idea about doing a time travel romp in the 19th Century but never found a story to make it work. Realm of Fear - a Barclay episode about transporter phobia - never really takes off either and Man of the People is the worst episode of the series since Season 1. However, Relics, which sees the return of James Doohan as Scotty, is a fine episode and sees an upsurge in quality that lasts through most of the rest of the season. There are a few more weaker episodes - Aquiel, Quality of Life, Rascals, Birthright - but these overcome some iffy premises and scripting with good ideas and solid performances.

More interesting are the classics. Chain of Command is a superb, tense masterclass in which Patrick Stewart is tortured by David Warner for a full hour whilst the Enterprise gets a new captain who is a bit of a martinet, but who is also an effective military commander who just happens to do things differently. It's one of the few Star Trek two-parters where the two parts work well together. Tapestry, although slightly overrated, is also a tremendously good episode where Picard revisits his past and finds out how he became the man he is now.

Better still are the underrated episodes that didn't stand out so much originally but now emerge as being more interesting: True Q is the lesser Q episode of the season is still a vastly superior rewrite of Season 1's Hide and Q; Ship in a Bottle and Frame of Mind foreshadow Inception with their multiple levels of reality; Lessons is a rarely effective Picard romance episode (let down by a hugely problematic ending); Starship Mine is an effective TNG cover version of Under Siege, with Picard as Steven Segal; and Timescape is a moody, atmospheric time travel mystery with some excellent direction.

The season is let down by its trite cliffhanger in Descent, a good example of the writers finding a great image for the cliffhanger and working backwards from there to find the story and not succeeding. But for a show 150 episodes and six years into its run, it's still finding fresh takes on established tropes and the cast is working together superbly as a unit.

For this HD re-release, the show has been completely re-edited from the original film stock. A vast amount of time and money went into this, and this pays off with some spectacular effects (more impressive as most of them are the original elements, simply re-combined at a higher resolution) and an image quality that makes it look like the show was filmed yesterday. There's a few moments which haven't translated as well - the duplicate Rikers in Second Chances oddly look unconvincing, given the simplicity of the effect - but the improvement in visual quality is stunning.

The sixth season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (****) still finds the show at the top of its game and still generating entertaining stories delivered by a cast of seasoned performers. The season is available now on Blu-Ray in the UK and USA.",1411776000,,3640,4.644409937888199

The gag reel was so so.  I was amazed how many deleted scenes actually were filmed way over the 52 min episode time frame, and the 1 with the most extra scenes was ""Chain Of Command(2 parter), which is the first separately offered individual BD episode, I haven't decided I must own to watch seamlessly together.  I much rather they had done a ""Time's Arrow"" individual 2 parter released episode BD.  I may get it way down the line when it's discounted or clearance priced. Not sure why this release took so long to be out, it doesn't have any awesome extras like previous issues did.  I look forward to TNG's final 7th season release on BD in the fall.  Then I can purge my shelves of the massively thick dvd sets, along with my Enterprise sets when I score that series' final season on BD as well.  Here's hoping for TNG's 7th season BD, they find some really great gems not ever seen before to put into their extras/featurettes!",1404604800,,1089,4.432160804020101

1694456,5,B000063V8U,"As with the first five seasons of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' on Blu-ray, Season Six does not disappoint.

The HD restoration completed by CBS-D is phenomenal.  Season Six suffered a bit from lack of color; go back and watch a couple episodes on Netflix and compare to your Blu-ray.  There is so much color in the HD restoration it just pops right off the screen.  The audio is on impeccable.

The bonus features are plentiful.  There are a great deal of deleted scenes with this season's set and the gag reel is fantastic.  My only complaint - and I hate even making it - is in the 3-part documentary.  At first I was thrilled they went back to giving a three-part documentary, after Seasons Four and Five only gave us two-part docs.  The majority of the first documentary on this set is devoted to the discussion of 'Deep Space Nine.'  While some might find that to be irrelevant I was excited.  First, since there are no current plans to provide an HD restoration to DS9 (c'mon CBS, just do it, give the fans what we want!!!) I thought it would be nice to get some discussion of that series.  Second, DS9 spun-off halfway through TNG's sixth season so a discussion is actually quite relevant.

There is a newly-filmed discussion with Rick Berman regarding DS9 but the rest of the footage is completely archival.  What a waste of opportunity!  If they're going to discuss DS9 in a newly produced documentary, why not discuss it in terms of its relevance at the time to TNG.  Colm Meaney, who is featured in archival interview footage, could have been brought in (and maybe he wasn't available) to discuss O'Brien's transition from TNG to DS9, what it was like to leave TNG, the uptick in his character's development in Season Five and the beginning of Season Six of TNG.  Since Season Six features the crossover episode ""Birthright,"" they could have had Michael Dorn and Alexander Siddig (who appeared as Dr. Bashir) discuss their experiences.  Why not have the TNG cast recall their initial reactions to the news of DS9's development and how they feel that series may have impacted their own.  So much missed opportunity with that.

The second and third documentaries are as brilliant as we've come to expect from previous sets.  We finally get Whoopi Goldberg giving her insights, we get more John de Lancie, and more from the TNG cast.

Despite my one complaint about one of the three documentaries I give this five stars because a) the production value from CBS-D is top-notch, b) the amount and quality of the extras (for the most part) do not disappoint, and c) I was reminded of how consistent the quality of writing this season was.",1403654400,10,2647,4.67170626349892

1694485,5,B000063V8U,"Since Amazon condenses the reviews of multiple formats into one pile, I hope this one stands out. It covers CBS/Paramount's new Blu-ray release of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""'s sixth season, NOT the earlier DVD release. I was able to get an advance copy from the studio and also used it to write a separate full-length review of this title for DVD Talk.

Once again, CBS Video has produced a top tier Blu-ray release that ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" fans will enjoy. Each and every episode has been re-scanned from the original camera negative, with the end result being much crisper and more detailed than the older DVD and broadcast versions which were shot on film but edited on videotape. The visual effects in many cases have been cleaned up or tastefully redone, and I'd be hard-pressed to complain about any of them. They're so good that casual fans of ""TNG"" might not even notice!

As for the episodes themselves, Season Six might just be ""TNG""'s best yet, or certainly its most consistent.  Personal favorites include the two-part ""Chain of Command"" (available separately as a stand-alone release), ""Relics"" (featuring a guest appearance by James Doohan as 'Scotty'!), ""Realm of Fear"" (Barclay fears the transporter), ""Schisms"" (crew members disappear while they sleep), the Western-themed ""A Fistful of Datas"", Moriarty's return in ""Ship in a Bottle"", Q's penultimate appearance in ""Tapestry"", the Die Hard-esque ""Starship Mine"", the brain-bending ""Frame of Mind"", ""Timescape"" (the Enterprise is caught in temporal stasis), the Borg-centric season finale ""Descent, Part I"" and many others. Very few are anything close to ""below average"" during this fantastic 26-episode run, save for misfires like ""Aquiel"" and the disappointing second half of ""Birthright"". Even so, TNG's batting average this season stayed ridiculously high overall, making it one of the series' most consistently entertaining runs to date...especially in comparison to its less impressive final year.

As for the bonus features, they're mostly as good as the ones we've seen on past Blu-ray collections. Highlights include a three-part retrospective featurette (although the first part, oddly enough, spends most of its time talking about ""Deep Space Nine""), a handful of deleted scenes, a blooper reel, TV promos and more. The archived featurettes from the DVD release are even ported over!

Let's say the average movie length is 110 minutes.  When it comes out on Blu-ray it's usually around $20.  Now, $20 divided by 110 minutes = .181 which translates to roughly 18 cents per minute of HD content.

Apply this to Star Trek TNG Season 6 on Blu-ray.  $120 divided by 1175 minutes = .102 which translates to roughly 10 cents per minute of HD content.

In summary;

1694523,5,B000063V8U,It's Star Trek how can you not love it? Plus it streams nicely so that is awesome if you are a prime member.,1395100800,,108,3.739130434782609
1694524,5,B000063V8U,"It's reportedly costing Paramount about nine million dollars per season to redo all the special effects from scratch in HD, since they were originally composited on video at SD broadcast resolution. The 1080p remastering also had to be done with the original film negatives, which required restoration and tedious, meticulous re-assembly from piles of reels stored in cardboard boxes in disparate locations. Some shot sequences would be completely missing, and they'd spend weeks hunting for the missing pieces. Some were never recovered, so the sequence had to be up-converted from the broadcast tapes.

All of this information is in the mini-documentary that came with the Season One Blu-rays, except for how much it cost them, because they're classy like that.

They're also upgrading all the sound and music from analog stereo to 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio, a lossless theater-grade audio format which no previous medium had enough space for. If that's not enough, they've produced multiple feature-length documentaries in HD for the Blu-ray series, and an extended episode or two showing footage that no one outside the studio has ever seen in *any* resolution.

That kind of work requires non-trivial resources.

Season 4 fell below $80 less than six weeks after release and never came back. After four months, it could regularly be found for $60 to $70. Season 5 has had a slower decline but dipped below $60 during the Black Friday sales, about four months after release. Going back to Season 3, it listed at the actual list price for about a week before plummeting.

After a brief window, this set will be available for half the list price or less, just like all the others. And if the previous sets are any indication, it will be worth every damn penny. Paramount does not owe you a discount because of personal economic misfortune. Please do not give a *unreleased* product one star solely because its list price upsets you.",1395014400,7,1932,4.987577639751553
1694555,5,B000063V8U,Good god the level of entitlement coming from the other two reviews is astounding. IF YOU CANT AFFORD IT DON'T BUY IT. The amount of work required to remaster a 25 year old TV show is immense and the price tag is justified. If you can't spend $120 it will drop to $75 and then $45 probably within a year of its release. Get over it.,1395014400,19,332,4.045454545454546

1694557,1,B000063V8U,"There is no denying Star Trek--the Original series and all the subsequent spin-offs including the excellent Star Trek: The Next Generation has impacted upwards of three generations of Americans. That said however, one must call attention to the fact that both Paramount and its distributors seemingly have NO SHAME by offering this Sixth Season on Blu Ray for $120.00! I guess they do not realize that the economy is still in recession, that people have been laid off, given reduced working hours and no longer are getting that extra discretionary money to use for such things as DVD sets. Bread, milk and medical care come first. With seasons 1-5 being offered this week (March 16-21, 2014) at $32-45 per season reflects that actual state of affairs. To gouge and it is GOUGING the loyal Star Trek fans for nearly three times that price for Season Six, exposes the GREED that drives Paramount and its distributors. Thus, one star (it deserves a half-star) for the pricing. As for me (and I am sure many others) we will await more realistic pricing whether it takes three-six-or twelve months for that to arrive. There are plenty of other DVDs to watch in the interim. As Captain Picard would intone: ""Make it so!""",1395014400,8,1214,4.813397129186603

Season 6 is yet another incredible season from one of my favorite shows (only bested in the Trek universe by DS9 in my eyes) but ultimately I feel that seasons 3, 4, and 5 were the pinnacle of the series and it took an ever-so-slightly downturn starting at season 6.

Is it still great and worth getting? Oh absolutely!",1392163200,,446,4.01123595505618

Been a long time since I watched this series and each episode still has the same impact as it did 20 years ago.  The creators of this series used the same formula as the original, one that has always been the draw to science fiction for me.  It allows us to see the best of ourselves, and how we use it to overcome the worst, from the perspective of an outsider.  This optimistic view of the future was always compelling to a child of the 60s who was sure we would never survive to see 1970.

I haven't had a chance to actually watch the DVDs to make sure they all work (I'll do that right away, after reading some of the other reviews), but as far as the series is concerned, season six is one of my favorites! The only thing I'm sort of irked about is that the design of the box is different than the other copies I have! It's not like what is pictured, it's more simplistic. Rather than opening up like a book, it' opens like a pizza box. You can't tell when it's sitting on the shelf next to the other TNG season boxes, though, so I guess it's something I'll have to live with. I wonder if it's just because this series is so old and they just don't really make this version of the DVDs, anymore. Most people are probably buying the Blu-ray boxset, these days.

1694743,5,B000063V8U,"This show was top notch; still better than almost anything on TV these days.  I guess this is when science was a cool thing, rather than silenced and ""evil"", and it was a nerd's dream.  Nothing was dumbed-down for the audience.  The plot lines were great, and the characters were very well rounded-out; Data's charactera unique android who became more human as the series evolved (and he learned more about how humans think)was a philosophical story unto itself.  Wharf, a half-Klingon, added yet another avenue for unique perspectives and plot lines into the Star Trek universe.  And the actors as a whole, starting with Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard, were stellar, many having been classically trained.  No expense was spared on sets and special effects, which still hold up today against high-budget hollywood films.  The late 80s/early 90s was a great time for TV audiences; I guess the network execs saw worth in spending money on producing quality series such as this one.

Now, even the ""educational"" channels (History Channel, Discovery, etc) are mostly reality TV programs which cost nothing to produce.  I'm very thankful Star Trek:TNG is not only available for streaming, but was fully restored in HD (all the special effects were redone by hand to hold up to the Blu-Ray HD conversionnoted as one of the most comprehensive film restoration projects ever attempted).",1375228800,,1382,5.079646017699115

and the Discovery of a Dyson Sphere.
All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this to All Star Trek Fans out there.

The first episodes are a little bit rough around the edges. But once the crew of the Enterprice get their act together, this actors blend it very well and deliver a fantastic series. Just a few reasons when I think this series has been so popular, despite its age.",1374796800,,469,4.719512195121951

1694748,5,B000063V8U,"Fantastic seller, prompt service and product in excellent condition. I love this show and this set does it the justice deserved.

- Works on my dated media players for PC
- Works on DVD player
- Typically 4 Episodes per CD, with Episode number/name on them individually.
- Menu interface is well organized and very well done (i.e.options, scene selection, episodes have auto-playing mini-clips above their titles)

I'm very happy with this product and recommend it to anyone looking to complete their collection. I took a gamble buying the full set of this version, but I found it was truly worth it. Did I mention I love this show? I tend to forget the show was filmed in the 80's and early 90's. A lot of love&talent went into this show, not just from the actors/actresses, but the sets, sfx, costumes, and the incredible writers.

If you're new to TNG, try to find some episodes on Netflix, Hulu, or Vudu. Sci-fi, drama, comedy, period-pieces such as Sherlock Holmes themes - it's got a little bit of everything. Every episode has it's very own charm.",1374624000,,1054,4.717391304347826

1694800,1,B000063V8U,I've been slowly collecting Star Trek DVDs and have all of the original series along with through Season Five of the Next Generation.  Recently ran into a issue that has me reconsidering buying the DVDs from Amazon.  I purchased Season Six earlier this year and I normally like to watch 1-2 episodes a week.  Usually takes me 3-4 months to watch an entire season.  In this case after about three months I was at the end of disk 6 and discovered a default in two of the episodes which caused the show to freeze.  I asked Amazon if I could return the DVDs (wish I could have just swapped that one disk) and was informed that there is a 30 day return policy.  How many people watch an entire season in 30 days!?  I see a policy problem here.  They did agree to forward my request to the company that shipped the DVDs and I was offered a chance to return the season to them (as long as I made the trip to the Post Office and payed the shipping cost).  That was nearly two months ago...still haven't received a refund.  I've spent several hundred dollars on DVDs to this point and think there ought to be a better way.,1370217600,5,1113,4.257142857142857
1694801,5,B000063V8U,"I always enjoy these episodes of Star Trek. The Captain always seems to have the correct action to take to handle any situation which may arise.

It's also unusually brutal, and doesn't shy away from the subject of torture (not a usual topic for TV fiction).  While the episode's backstory is a bit contrived, twenty years after it was filmed, it still remains touching and relevant.

I'm rewatching all of ST:TNG with the GF in sequence, years after seeing them sporadically when they first aired.

1694916,4,B000063V8U,"It's a good episode, but it's just a bit slow. It does pick up at the end, especially with the little surprise that Barclay does during the transportor fix they were carrying out.

What makes this episode is Reginald Barclay, a Starfleet officer who stutters, suffers from anxiety, and is a social awkward mess. You'd think that in 200 years people would have ""cured"" these sort of things, but that's what makes Star Trek special--it's about the things that makes us human. So it starts out with Barclay's irrational fear of transport (akin to today's fear of flying). While this premise is a of a steal from Dr. McCoy's character (he hated transporting), it works well into the story since Barclay experiences something very real but he fears no one will believe him. And as usual, Captain Picard shows his care for all his crew, and orders this mystery solved. Also, Geordi shows that he cares about those under his command as well.

Good episode, just doesn't make a top 10 TNG list, though Barclay's character is very memorable and important in the ST universe.",1351468800,,1065,4.751351351351351

Due to a transporter accident 8 years ago, there are now 2 Rikers, with the recently discovered one still being in the frame of mind of having just left Betazed and looking forward to meeting up with Troi on Risa.

1694980,5,B000063V8U,"No words can elaborate on this wonderful piece of achievement. This is a sci-fi/drama masterpiece woven togteher by a tightly nit group of actors who became friends and played off eac other flawlessly in this outer space show about exploration. Many people try to ""crack"" this formula and master it, but fail. At last, Gen Roddenberry and Rick Berman finally did it, making what was quite possibly the most beloved sci-fi series ever made for television, which even rival (if not overcome) stupid awful crap star wars, which is mindless battling in the future.

Star trek is for people who wish to see what it might be like on another planet, to meet others like us, to live the dream of a futuristic navyman (a ship versus a...ship on water) in the federation wher ethey are charged with exploration, versus mindless killing in the star wars.

If you have ever wished to see the world beyond earth, to ever see any kind of possible realistic portrayal of what life might be like on a space ship (a cozy one, not some damned ugly space-submarine like on Enterprise series of Star trek) and to explore the world that is described and theorized on by the greatest minds such as Albert Einstein and his theory on relativity and Stephen Hawkings on black holes, you name it, they had seven seasons to spend at least one or more episodes trying to explain and explore these wild phenomena and what it might be like to get in close, to see these phenonema affect worlds around us, which are often inhabited.

Plus, there are many different lifeforms ranging from near Gods to the tiniest microscopic lifeforms...all of which are explored. Even inner space (human body) is explored and the mind and its perceptions are forever questioned. Where time and space and life are all bound, Star Trek seeks to unbind them, revealing theoretical truths (based on knowledge from the 80's however, people today would spot some ""older"" , no longer valid information).

Aside from being a little out of date in this year of 2010, it is amazingly enjoyable. I have seen every episode of the Next generation series over 9 times, some more, and I have not grown tired of it. I just wish more shows would pick up this genre...Stargate SG1 is great too, though it is cast in Star Trek's indomitable shadow.",1276214400,,2282,4.6975

There is so much going for this season, from the story lines, to the acting, to the character development, which is something this series lacked in it's first 2 seasons, and once again the special effects are great.

'Time's Arrow Part 2' kicks off the season from the season 5 ending cliffhanger, what a great episode, both parts, if you've seen season 5, you know that Data has to go back to the 19th century to save himself, and part 2 picks right up, and doesn't disappoint, 'Realm of Fear' is another Reggie Barclay episode, not much to say about it, just a nice solid all-around episode, 'Man of the People' is a bit on the sub-par side, but does get interesting, so not a waste of time, in 'Relics' guess who we meet again?! Montgomery Scott (Scotty!) from The Original Series, this is a very well done episode, bringing Scotty into the 24th century after being in limbo for 75 years, an excellent episode, in 'Schisms' the crew encounters strange happenings due to an unwelcome alien visit, good solid episode, 'True Q' the first of two Q episodes on this season, and a great episode, giving a woman a chance to decide wether to Q or not to Q, then we get 'Rascals' which I think is very well done, a none-annoying kid episode, a transporter accident transforms Picard, Guinan, Keiko, and Ensign Ro are transformed into what they were as children, a great episode.

'A Fistul of Data's' continues the excellence of this season, Worf and Alexander are set to do battle in the wild west...with Data! a great episode, 'The Quality of Life' an episode in which a robot is created to make it easier for the crew to maintain the ship, but Data feels it is wrong using a lifeform to do their work, and tries to prove that the robot is indeed life, nice! 'Chain of Command Parts 1 and 2, just a terrific two part episode, Picard are crew are on a top secret mission from Starfleet, and part of the role, is Picard resigning his command to Captain Jellico (played by Ronny Cox), so that Picard and his crew can go undercover and carry out their mission, but are taken hostage by the Cardassians! and in part 2, the crew aboard the Enterprise are not convinced with their new captain, and insist on a rescue attempt on Picard and his away team, an awesome episode!, the great episodes just keep coming 'Ship in a Bottle' Moriary who was put into the Holodeck system in season 2 is wanting more, wanting to experience life outside in the real world, with his wife, excellent!

'Aquiel' the only bad episode, I'm not going to explain it, 'Face of the Enemy' perfect episode after the only bad one on this season, Troi wakes up aboard a Romulan warbird, unknowingly, she is on a top secret mission for the Federation, great episode, 'Tapestry' the second 'Q' episode of the season, Picard is killed, and Q gives him the chance to change his destiny, some terrific drama between Picard and Q, just another great episode!, 'Birthright Parts 1 and 2' Worf and Data set out to find their fathers, not much else to say, just another solid episode, it's getting to be a theme with this season, 'Starship Mine' while the Enterprise is being struck with lethal rays, Picard discovers a band of interstellar thieves are aboard the Enterprise, excellent! (also features Tim Russ) who would later play Mr. Tuvok on Voyager!, 'Lessons' is actually a great love story episode, Picard is forced to send a woman he has fallen in love with on a dangerous mission, great ending!.

'The Chase' continues the excellence, the Enterprise is in a race with the Klingons and the Cardassians to solve a 4 billion year old genetic puzzle, the ending is shocking, and great!, 'Frame of Mind' another great episode, Riker is trapped in a mental hospital with hardly any memory of the past and is convinced he is going insane, another shocking ending, 'Suspicions' A Ferangi scientist is on the brink of a new discovery, but his partners aren't so sure, and the Ferangi is murdered, Dr. Crusher suspects one of his partners, which it did turn out to be, BUT NOT WHO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE, 'Rightful Heir' a great Klingon episode, the Klingons have made a copy of the greatest Klingon of all time 'Kahless' whom they want to take over the empire, but Worf and others aren't so sure!, 'Second Chances' another great Riker episode, while transporting down to a research station, Riker discovers a exact of himself, who tries to rekindle the relationship with Troi, great episode!, 'Timescape' EXCELLENT, The Enterprise is frozen with a Romulan warbird and is on the brink of annihilation, GREAT!, and then we get to the season ending cliffhanger, 'Descent Part 1' A GREAT cliffhanger, while checking out a planet that has been attacked, the away team discover that it is indeed, THE BORG, and they help Data feel his first emotion...to feel angry!, The Borg convince him to join them...little do we know, at the end of the episode, we discover Data has not only joined the Borg, but Lore as well!, and together they plan to destroy the Federation!

1695004,5,B000063V8U,"The season really tests the intelligence of the audience by taking risks unheard of in a science fiction series. There are a few clunkers in this season (""Rascals"" comes to mind), but overall, it really played with the format and took off in some bold new directions. Here are some highlights:

""Schisms""- A kind of UFO abduction episode, in which the crew members try to piece together missing gaps in time caused by clicking insect-like aliens who are taking away Enterprise crew members into another dimension.

""Chain of Command"" is brilliant not just for Patrick Stewart's harrowing performance as a torture victim, but also for Ronnie Cox as the hard-nosed substitute Captain Jellico. Not since William Windom's Matt Decker have we seen such a plausible Federation captain who does things a different way.

""Face of the Enemy"" is eminently re-watchable for Carolyn Seymour's brilliant performance as the cunning Romulan Commander Toreth. You can actually see how she thinks through every move on the tense attack on the Enterprise. With smart characters like these, it's really hard to hate the Romulans. Actually, you walk away respecting them even more the Federation crew.

We have two Klingon ""cultural pride"" episode with ""Birthright"" and its companion piece, the fascinating ""Rightful Heir"" with Kevin Conway (the unforgettable Doctor Haber from the old PBS miniseries ""Lathe of Heaven"" for those of you who grew up in the 70s) miniseries playing a Klingon version of Jesus, who fufills the prophecy a Second Coming. The episode explores the role of religion and mythology in a civilization.

Jonathan Frakes shines in ""Frame of Mind,"" another mind-bender who has Riker questioning his own sanity as he tries to wade through levels of reality, in another UFO-abduction style episode.

The interview with Levar Burton on the ""making of"" CD sent chills up my spine. Here is a fan of the old series who got to connect with the Star Trek universe in a way few of us ever could.",1176595200,3,1985,5.018237082066869

1695016,5,B000063V8U,"Season Six aired 'Chain of Command part 2' I'm just going to review the one episode.

In 'Chain of Command' Captain Picard, who knows Starfleet's battle plans for this sector of space, is captured by the Cardassians who are planning a surprise attack.

The entire episode consists of Picard being tortured by Cardassians. He's shown 4 lights in front of him and asked, ""How many lights are there""? When Picard says ""4"" he's subjected to extreme pain. He's told, ""you see 5 lights Captain, tell us how many you see"". There are 4 lights, and Picard continues to tell him there are 4.

Other reviewers have said this is a scene taken from the story '1984' by George Orwell. Perhaps to highlight or explain the 'Orwellian' idea in the book, of being told one thing, while reality is something else. I did not notice this connection myself watching the episode, having never read '1984'.

Apparently, for the Cardassians, getting him to admit to something he knows is not true, even something as meaningless as this, is the first step in his brainwashing. They never ask Picard about battle plans, Starship numbers, or anything, but the number of lights. He's continuously subjected to extreme pain but even after extreme torture they can never get Picard to say he sees 5 lights. This is a terrible episode for the character of Picard, ranking up there with the one where Picard is assimilated by the Borg against his will.

After being rescued from the ordeal, Picard is counseled by Deanna Troi back about the Enterprise. He says, ""You know, near the end. I could see five lights"". Obviously with the torture he could 'see' 5 lights, something that wasn't even there (a powerful statement on it's own), but he continued to tell his captors he only say 4.

The episode is done in such a way that the end is really an awakening of sorts, and potentially a beginning. There was never any doubt in my (overconfident) mind that they intended to make some kind of statement at the end. I've only seen the episode once, but I knew that what I felt at the end was not a figment of my imagination or something subjective or personal.

When the show ends; when Picard says those last lines to Deanna Troi, about being alone on the prison planet, he's looking almost directly into the camera and not at Deanna, ""Near the end. I could see five lights"". When he says those last lines at the end.... we know he's talking to us.",1170720000,2,2411,4.606060606060606
1695017,5,B000063V8U,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order although Season Three was aired fairly much according to the chronological produced order except for episode one and two which are switched around. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG) had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Star Trek: Season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the Season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that Star Trek, Deep Space Nine: Season 1 whipped up while Season 6 was running. 1993 was TV Sci-Fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of ST for the year. This means for the folks who have been watching TOS and TNG, now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between TNG Season 6 and DS9 Season 1. You can find the order if you search the new for it. TNG has really good stories while DS9 gets the effects. We are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story. Season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises (Picard acting like a Russian is hysterical. Would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time? Maybe yes!). The conclusion of Season five's ""Time's Arrow"" is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien but will be transferred to DS9 (his absence is not mentioned). Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is back along with Alexander Rozhenko. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) will also leave for DS9. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is back after being absent from Season 5. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about transporter psychosis, empaths, Scotty!, alien abductions, Q, age regression, android dreams, artificial life, Cardassians, Prof. Moriarty, love, Romulan defection, destiny, Klingon birthrights, thieves, command ethics, origins of life, insanity, murder, faith, doubles, time travel and the Borg. Like Season 5 most the episodes in Season 6 have above average sci-fi stories, combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew. Memorable episodes include, A Fistful of Datas, The Quality of Life, Ship in a Bottle, Face of the Enemy, Birthright and lessons. There are three very good episodes which really make the season worth. Tapestry sees Picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart. Suspicion is a great whodunit episode (of which there are a few) with one of the coolest Star Trek aliens ever (should have made him a main character). Descent Part I is a very nice slight of hand trick. You will keep thinking Hugh right up until the last second. In TNG: Season 6 the crew make contact with Deep Space Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order. If you are in for 6 you may also be in for Season One of DS9! So see you in Season Seven which will be watched with DS9 Season Two.",1169424000,2,6087,4.667597765363128

1695023,1,B000063V8U,"The DVDs themselves are of good quality; I've rented many seasons' worth and reminded myself which stories throughout the run were good and which were not...

$50 per season is on par and is a good price. (So what's coming soon that's compelling people to buy these current sets?)

Wish I could afford it; thanks to the prices of necessities gone up so much (food, shelter, and distilled petroleum products being slightly more important than Captain Picard standing around as if he hasn't spent a penny in decades...), $50 is still an effective $100 out of my pocket in the end.

Season 6 continues the inane preachy banality introduced big-time for season 5.  The music continues to degenerate; and another composer with the same garish yet banal style only makes things even less interesting.  I'd say that, by this point when I first saw these in 1992-3, I was begging to see season 1 reruns as they were far more interesting (and still are)...

Times Arrow II:  It's dealt with, Data survives.

Realm of Fear:  Worst Barclay story; he's scared of transporters because he sees big centipedes in them.  Nice to see the 'effect' of teleportation, but the story is crackers.

Man of the People:  A trite concept, but reasonably well handled.  not a classic by any measure, but it is watchable.

Relics:  Dig into the vast well of Classic Trek to bring in the viewers for some reason; and we get James Doohan's best performance ever as Scotty.  Well written, well acted, nice sci-fi concept (Dyson sphere, even if improbable), there are no downsides here.  (unfortunately, the same people involved in making this story totally forget about it when writing the movie ""Generations""...)

Schisms:  Paying homage to ""alien abductions"" in general isn't very bright, but in a sci-fi show where you're travelling the galaxy in a starship, it's definitely scraping bottoms of barrels for plot ideas.

True-Q:  Gee, a gay themed story that never meant to be!  And it's so much better than ""The Outcast""!  A niche piece, I have a soft spot for it, and Q turning Crusher into a dog is priceless.

Rascals:  Underrated and fun.  I'm not sure why as it's easy to tear this one apart.  But the Guinan/Ro discussion alone makes it worth watching; the talk of re-living a past to make up for its down sides was really good.  Gotta like this one too.

A Fistful of Datas:  I don't recall, but it's a holodeck story that makes Data a villain.

The Quality of Life: Yet another ""is a machine sentient"" story, as if all the others we had before weren't enough, this one outdoes all the others in terms of inane, pointless rehashing of old ideas.  And it's so shamelessly one-sided that I had to throw up.

Chain of Command:  Replace the Borg with the Cardassians and it's 90% the same.  There are 4 lights, we know...  David Warner makes for a cool villain, however.  And his quality of acting would make ""there are 5 lights"" believeable.  It's a mixed bag, this one...

Ship in a Bottle:  Nice continuation/conclusion to Moriarity except they didn't include the continuity from the first story; Moriarity knowing quite well about the Enterprise... still, it's great fun - with a terrific ending to boot.  A far better Barclay story!

Aquiel - filler.

Face of the Enemy:  Empty ""Underground Railroad in space"".  Troi is irritating, to say the least.  More concerned about being kidnapped, it's amazing she got the job done at all.

Tapestry: CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC!  Best season 6 story BY FAR. (well, Relics comes close...)  Picard dies in an explosion and Q intercedes to give Picard a second chance...  And Picard learns a lesson about living in fear or having the guts to try to get ahead...  highly refreshing in a season of drivel that redefines the word to new lows.

Birthright:  More waffle in what seems to be a parallel to America regarding part 2 with Worf...  pt 1 is centric to Data.

Starship Mine:  Typically banal music hinders what is a decent action plot.  Though Picard being butch does stretch credibility; it's passable and there are some terrific set-pieces.

Lessons:  Wow, Picard falls in love again - but has to send her to a possible death.  (hmmm, and we have entire families on this ship again for what reason?  To off them all as entire families?)

The Chase:  Interesting attempt to show why every critter in Star Trek lore looks like a human with an overcooked omelet glued to its head.  Lame music hampers the story, and is poorly paced (what else is new), but the core idea alone makes it worth a glance!

Frame of Mind:  Riker in a mental asylum?  Partly bland, but passable.  Great f/x are unexpected and highly enjoyed too.

Suspicions: UGH!  More one-sided preach-a-thon pablum

Rightful Heir:  More Worf subplot.  (gee, Crusher, Troi, and Riker have no past lives worthy of exploitation anymore?!)

Second Chances:  A doppelganger episode.  Not bad...  but surprisingly underwhelming.

Timespace:  Another refreshing story using science as a backdrop to some very surreal and frightening events.  Definitely a must-see.

Descent pt1:  Oh dear.  The Borg.  Again.  But these aren't ordinary Borg...  and all due to Picard's meddling?  And Lore is back too, feeling the Borg's pain!!

yeah, the show is rock bottom and the show managed to get renewed; the original finale was to see the ship crashed (the Generations DVD commentary goes into this further... or was it the ""All Good Things"" season 7 bonus material?)

So, how does the final season fare?  Much better than one would think...",1138406400,7,5507,4.80085653104925
1695024,5,B000063V8U,"If you've been getting all the Next Generation box sets, there's no reason to stop now.  Season Six pretty much fires on all cylinders, presenting lots of compelling episodes, a handful of entertaining two-parters (I particularly enjoyed the ""Chain of Command"" two-parter, where Ronny Cox replaces Picard as captain and starts slapping around the crew with his own version of tough love), and a minimum of soapiness.  You also get two great bookends to the season: the return of Scotty to the Trek universe near the start of the set and the action-packed return of the Borg (well, a slightly banged-up Borg splinter group, at any rate) at season's end.  The extras are once again generous, interesting, and well-organized.",1127174400,3,722,5.050420168067227
1695025,5,B000063V8U,"Nominated for 58 Emmys, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation fulfilled all the potential and promise anticipated of a long-awaited successor to the original 1960s series - Star Trek. Created by a former L.A. police officer, Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) became the first TV series to follow on the heels of the original, and its success would spark the creation of three additional series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). But The Next Generation remained the most popular spin-off. Despite new characters and new episodes, the mission remained the same as before - ""to boldly go where no man has gone before..."" And to continue the rich tradition of the Star Trek name - a mission Star Trek: The Next Generation accomplishes with relative ease...

Star Trek: The Next Generation takes place in the 24th Century, almost one-hundred years after Captain Kirk's crew set out to explore strange new worlds. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart - I Claudius) commands the USS Enterprise-D and its diverse crew of humans, cyborgs, and varying life forms. Accompanying him on his voyage is an entirely new cast of passengers and crew including Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes - North & South), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and her son Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton)... Together, they struggle against numerous obstacles to carry out the mission of the USS Enterprise: ""To explore strange new worlds... To seek out new life; new civilizations... To boldly go where no one has gone before!"" This pioneering attitude, coupled with imaginative and brilliantly-produced alien worlds, provides Star Trek with its unique allure and special place within American pop culture - especially those episodes from the original series, widely regarded as the most popular of the Star Trek franchise...

The Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 6) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Time's Arrow"" in which time travel creates more problems for the Enterprise as the away team's mission is disturbed by a curious and nosy Samuel Clemens. Meanwhile, Capt. Picard has a recollection of an encounter on Earth in the 1890s... Other notable episodes from Season 6 include ""A Fistful of Datas"" in which a group of hackers have stolen Data's physical features and real life abilities and the crew must work overtime to get him back, and ""Lessons"" in which Capt. Picard is placed in a precarious position when carrying out his duty threatens to place the woman he loves in dire jeopardy...

1695036,5,B000063V8U,"In the sixth season, Star Trek: The Next Generation decided to go off in some new directions and new ideas.  The season opens with the conclusion of the cliffhanger Time's Arrow.  The second adventure is better than the first...a great way to finish the story.  We revert again back to the Original series a bit with ""Relics"" which contains James Doohan guest starring as ""Scotty"".  Humor came through in ""A Fistful of Datas"" and we saw Patrick Stewart give arguably his best performance of the series in ""Chain of Command"".  The sixth season contains my personal favorite sequence of the series which is Data's dream sequence in ""Birthright, Part I"".  I think the sixth season was when Star Trek: The Next Generation was at its best.  It was the climax of the entire show.  It ends with Descent...probably the best cliffhanger since ""The Best of Both Worlds"".
Personal Favorite Episodes:
Time's Arrow: Part II, Relics, Schisms, True Q, Rascals, A Fistful of Datas, Chain of Command: Parts I and II, Face of the Enemy, Tapestry, Birthright, Part I, Starship Mine, The Chase, Frame of Mind, Timescape, and Descent: Part I",1081814400,2,1120,4.8578947368421055

I have to confess the purple of this box is probably my favorite colour, and it really looks nice stacked up with the other DVDs.
 They changed the clip format for this box set, choosing to go with one screen showing clips of the four episodes back to back. While this allows you to focus your attention on only one screen, it can also be annoying. Season six seems to be in heavy rotation on television, and if you've seen a lot of the episodes the wait can be annoying, but it's worth it.",1081036800,2,675,4.357142857142857
1695038,4,B000063V8U,"While many took note that DS9's premire took a little wind out of the sixth season,TNG juggled with stories that ranged from Playful(Rascals,A Fist Full Of Datas),introspective(Tapestry,Lessons),suspenseful(Face Of The Enemy) to eerie (Man Of The People,Schisms).
 The highlight of the season was Relics,which James Doohan's Scotty returns after being in a transporter stream for 75 years. The best episode of the season is the two part Chain Of Command which has Picard re-assigned,then taken prisoners & tortured by the Cardassians.
 The season finale Descent,returning with a new Borg threat ends on a limp note(especially after Best Of Both Worlds Pt 1),but season six was definately an interesting experience.",1060041600,5,714,5.601851851851852
1695039,4,B000063V8U,"One of the neatest things about these DVD sets are the documentaries.  I haven't mentioned them in my reviews up to this point and that is a failure on my part.  I mention them now because I was somewhat disappointed in the sixth season extras as opposed to the extras on the previous five box sets.  I'm only grumbling because the bonus material included a trailer for DS9, which is not my favorite Trek series.  It also contained a trailer for Star Trek Nemesis.  Obviously it was meant to be viewed before the movie came out, but I've already seen the movie and was angry that Paramount wasted good DVD space on a trailer for such a mediocre movie.  Still, the profile on Data was great and as always, its nice to see the insights that the writers, directors and producers give us into the episodes.  In one of the documentaries, someone mentioned that the sixth season of TNG was their best season ever.  I disagree with this assertion.  I've always championed seasons three and four as being top quality.  Still, the sixth season delivered consistently superior drama and contained fewer clunkers than did the fifth season.  We started out with the worst of the two-parters, ""Time's Arrow,"" and continued with the mediocre, ""Realm of Fear,"" but after that, the season took off with the arrival of Scotty.  It was a delight to see Spock make his appearance and it was equally fun for me as an original series fan to see Scotty again in the episode, ""Relics.""  It was also nostalgic to see the old Enterprise bridge.  Q makes two appearances in this season in, ""True Q,"" and ""Tapestry.""  In the former, we get to see a slightly softer side of Q as he tries to mentor a young girl who discovers she has the power of the Q.  ""Tapestry,"" is one of my all-time favorite Trek episodes because we learn more of Picard's past and Q teaches him a harsh lesson about life.  This is De Lancie and Stewart at their best!  Worf also confronts his past in the two-part, ""Birthright,"" when he journeys to a Romulan prison camp to find his father.  Troi also sees more action when she goes undercover as a Romulan officer in, ""Face of the Enemy.""  It is worth noting that Spock's Romulan underground movement is mentioned in this episode.  Unfortunately, this would be the last time we see a major plot thread involving the Romulans.  We also see the continuing plot thread involving the Klingon Empire come to an end in, ""Rightful Heir,"" as a new leader challenges Gowron as ruler of the Klingon world.  We would hear of the Klingons and Romulans again in later seasons of Deep Space Nine, but DS9 never did justice to them as TNG did.  Other gems include ""The Quality of Life,"" ""The Chase,"" ""Rascals,"" ""Aquiel,"" ""Frame of Mind,"" and ""A Fist Full of Datas.""  The only clunkers worth noting are ""Second Chances,"" and ""Realm of Fear.""  Many other reviewers have mentioned, ""Chain of Command,"" and I think this was probably the best offering of the sixth season.  Watching Riker clash with a new captain of the Enterprise was classic, but the most riveting drama came as Picard was tortured by a Cardassian officer, played by Trek veteran David Warner.  It was interesting to note that Patrick Stewart did research on torture before performing in this episode.  Finally, unlike the previous season, the finale of ""Descent,"" was another great cliffhanger.  Its always fun when Lore appears to provide the psychotic counterpart to Data's cool presence.  Throw Lore in league with a group of renegade Borg and you can't help but have suspense at its best.  All and all, the sixth season of TNG is a great addition to anyone's collection.  I would not recommend it to beginners, only because many plot threads are more easily understood after viewing previous seasons.",1058227200,3,3750,4.685015290519877
1695040,4,B000063V8U,"This is ST:TNG at its best.  The uniforms are fitting and the plots involving.  Every character is examined and every un-tied conclusion re-visited.

1695041,5,B000063V8U,"The sixth season of this marvelous series in my opinion is the best overall, well rounded season of the entire seven year run.  It is loaded with exceptional, thought provoking and heart warming episodes that resound of exceptional script writing and superb performances by the primary and guest actors.  From the season opener to the closer, few episodes fall out of the ""superb"" category!  This season is another marvelous example of Gene Roddenberry's vision.
 A brief synopsis of the ""stand out"" episodes of this particularly great season:
Relics - This superb episode is one of the most treasured episodes of the season as Scotty makes an appearance in the twenty fourth century and is befriended by the crew of the current Enterprise.
True Q - This is another great Q episode where John de Lancie makes his first of two sixth season appearances as Q.  Amanda Rogers, a young honor student is aboard the Enterprise and she is beginning to display some ""Q"" powers.
Rascals - This is another one of the exceptional episodes of the season where a transporter accident turns Picard, Guinan, Ro Laren and Keiko O'Brien into children.  Not longer after this ""accident,"" Ferengi end up in control of the ship.  Picard and the other ""rascals"" must find a way to regain control of the Enterprise.
A Fistful of Datas - Star Trek meets the old west in a hilarious and quite memorable episode.  Alexander convinces his father to join him on the holodeck in an ""ancient"" western.  Unfortunately the holodeck safeties become defective when Data performs an experiment that goes awry and he becomes integrated with the holodeck, putting Worf, Troi and Alexander in danger.
Chain of Command, Parts I & II - In this exceptional two part episode Starfleet Command has a new mission for Picard and part of that plan is replacing him with the irascible Captain Edward Jellico in command of the Enterprise.  While Jellico is dealing with the Cardassians, Picard's team sets off on their mission but is captured.  We meet Gul Madred who is played superbly by David Warner.  In some of the most heart wrenching scenes of Trek ever, we're forced to watch as Gul Madred tortures Picard.
Ship in a Bottle - In this particularly great episode, the producers bring closure to the second season episode that introduced Professor James Moriarty and his being put in computer memory.
Face of the Enemy - This episode is probably one of the best Troi episodes of the entire seven year run.  She awakens and looks in the mirror only to find she looks like a Romulan.  Troi finds that she must act out the role of a Tal Shiar agent and help the Romulan ""unificationists"" in order to hopefully get away from the Romulans.
Tapestry - In a rare second ""Q"" episode in one season, Q returns when Picard is injured and his artificial heart is damage beyond repair.  Q begins to explore the ""tapestry"" of Picard's life.  Q takes Picard all the way back to when a Nausicaan ran him through with a sword, causing him to get the artificial heart.  Tapestry in my opinion is probably the best Q/Picard episode of the series.
Birthright Parts I & II We are treated to an excellent episode as the Enterprise is docked at Deep Space Nine and Worf is approached by a Yridian named Shrek who wishes to sell him some information about his father.  Worf agrees to purchase the information as long as Shrek takes him to where his father is supposed to be alive.  What followed was one of the best ""Klingon"" episodes ever done in Star Trek.
Lessons - For the first time in his career, Picard meets a fellow officer under his command who he becomes attracted to.  This is a beautifully well written episode as we see Picard falling in love with Commander Darren and then go through gut wrenching anguish as he fears his orders may have caused her death.
The Chase - In another excellent episode, we meet Professor Galen who was one of Picard's professors at the Academy.  He offers Picard the opportunity of a lifetime for an archaeologist by joining him for an extended period of time.  Unfortunately he must refuse as he cannot leave the Enterprise.  Not long after Professor Galen departs, he is killed and Picard embarks on a mission of the utmost importance to find what Galen was looking for.  They make an astonishing discovery in the end that falls on end.  Of particular note is the ""humanoid"" at the end of the show played by Salome Jens whose later performances on DS9 as the leader of the Changelings are spectacular.
Rightful Heir - In another one of the most outstanding ""Klingon"" episodes, Worf seems to have lost his faith and requests leave to go to Boreth and seek Kahless, his people's mythic spiritual leader.  One can only imagine his surprise as while he's seeking Kahless, Kahless appears before him in flesh and blood.
Timescape - This is one of the more intriguing episodes as it begins with Picard, Troi, Data and LaForge returning from a conference in a runabout.  While on approach to the Enterprise's position, they begin to experience some temporal pockets.  They then discover the Enterprise and a Romulan Warbird frozen in the middle of what ""appears"" to be a battle.  {ssintrepid}

1695042,5,B000063V8U,"By the sixth season of Star Trek: TNG, the characters had gone through many changes- and the writers, through many ideas. I thought that season six would contain the decline of the quality of the episodes, and that new, unique ideas would be thrown to the wayside as writers focused their efforts on Deep Space Nine. Instead, Star Trek: TNG managed to continue being one of the best shows on television, largely due to the excellent performances of Patrick Stewart.
""Chain of Command, Parts 1 and 2"" contain what I consider to be some of the best acting from Stewart ever. Picard is tortured for days by the Cardassians, and Stewart plays the role of the victim perfectly. Not only did Part 2 contain some of his finest performances, but it actually managed to convey a message as well. It focuses mainly upon the roles of the characters. The Cardassian who tortures Picard and tries to break his will is left himself a broken man at the end of the episode, while Picard attains true victory by never giving in. An entertaining, powerful episode.
However, this was only one of the many amazing episodes that season six showcased. ""Relics"", which featured the return of Scotty from the original Trek, was great. ""Schisms"" put an eerie but interesting spin on the whole ""alien invaders from another dimension"" idea. ""Tapestry"" was another episode that made use of Stewart's amazing ability as an actor. John de Lancie guest starred as ""Q"" in that episode, and forced Picard to relive events in his life. ""Face of the Enemy"" finally gave the Romulans some action again after being shadowed by the Borg and the Cardassians. ""Starship Mine"" was probably the most ""action-packed"" episode of the season, and ""Timescape"" was another interesting episode involving being stuck in a moment in time. Finally, ""Descent, Part 1"" lacked the bang of most season finales, but wasn't all bad - after all, it did involve the Borg.
Overall, season six had episodes that really shined, despite suspicions that it might not.",1048550400,33,2002,4.856725146198831
1695043,5,B000063V8U,"Usually most television series are on their last legs by their next to last season. This wasn't the case with TNG. In fact, the writing/producing/directing/performing team seemed to have caught their second wind by season six--certainly one of their finest offerings.
I've read lots of complains about Time's Arrow (part 2). I found it to be a refreshing episode of the series--it did recall the flavor of Harlan Ellison's City on the Edge of Forever (more than the Roddenberry-Coon-Fontana rewrite). Adding Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain) to the mix was inspired.
While True Q didn't have the bite of most episodes involving Q, it still gave John De Lancie a chance to shine. It really wasn't about Q per se anyway. He was just a bystander in this case witnessing someone else's use of their Q power.
The real stand out episodes was the two part Chain of Command. The interaction between Patrick Stewart as Picard and David Warner as his torturer was riveting. One of Stewart's finest performances is featured in this great episode. In reality, it would actually have been a better season cliff hanger than Descent. I'd also like to praise Ronnie Cox and Jonathan Frakes for their performances as well; the two stories were well tailored and paralleled the changes within each character.
Quality of Life, Aquiel, Face of the Enemy, Ship in a Bottle (which resurrects Dr. Morarity from season 2), Tapestry and The Chase are all stand out episodes.  Aquiel is a brilliant character study as well as a look at the effects of loss on the individual. It's a stunning episode that reaches to the heart of humanity--even in a powerful alien spieces. The Chase is particularly interesting as it looks at the road not chosen by Picard as well as providing an interesting explaination as to why there are so many humanoid species populating the universe.
The extras are very nice. There's a profile of Data as well as a preview trailer for Deep Space Nine (which is finally coming to DVD!). Deep Space Nine was the only series spin off from TNG that expanded on the storytelling arcs and scope of the original series. It's one of the finest written of the Trek series and Avery Brooks is very under rated in his role as Sisko.
The picture quality is very good to excellent on most of the discs. There are no analog artifacts although there are a few digital ones from the compression technology of DVD; for example there's one scene where the background behind Riker appears to be a projection simply because the pixels don't change at a very high rate.
The sound quality is stunning. The remix to 5.1 brings a new depth (and appreciation) to the sound effects layered on the soundtrack. It's obvious someone was thinking ahead when they added all the background sounds. The music sounds quite good--not quite to SACD or even DVD-Audio standards--but very good nonetheless. There's a bit of compression but it's hardly noticable.
The extras have been improving with each additional year of the series (likewise the picture and sound quality). The only area for improvement is in the booklet. It's less than informative with a couple of paragraphs about the season and highlighting one or two episodes. It would be helpful to have a brief synopsis of each episode as well as guest stars (if any) and writer/director credits. All we get is the episode name, when it originally aired and what disc it's featured on (and this is alphabetical vs. airdate).
The other area that could use improvement is commentary from a key cast member, director or writer for a handful of pivotal episodes. The Babylon 5 box set Signs and Portents offers three episodes with interesting and enlightening commentaries by writer/creator/producer/director J. Michael Straczinski. It would have served Paramount well to do the same thing while the actors were shooting Nemesis. It's unlikely Paramount will be able to get the cast together again for a commentary given that Nemesis is likely the last TNG feature to be produced.
On the whole, Paramount has finally done well by Star Trek. The original series never received this much TLC (and since the market is smaller for it, their probably unlikely to do so).",1041724800,11,4179,4.861150070126227
1695044,3,B000063V8U,"Over all, I am satisified with season 6.  I would have given it a higher rating but the boxed set I purchased has two DISC 5 in it and no DISC 6.",1041120000,,145,3.53125
1695045,5,B000063V8U,"Alright some people say that Seasons 3-5 were the best.  I beg to differ.  I, along with the producers and the cast of the show agree that Season 6 had the most solid line-up of episodes in any season.  There wasn't hardly one episode in this season that was a stinker.  The only episode that I really didn't care for was ""Man of the People.""  The rest were just superb.  Granted a few were a bit contrived or a bit lsow-paced at times, but for the most part, every episode in this season showcased just how good TNG had become.
For example, there were several good Klingon, and this time,  Romulan shows.  ""Face of the Enemy"" along with ""Timescape"" were probably some of the best Romulan episodes in the entire series.  In ""Rightful Heir"" we meet Kahless, the legendary Klingon leader from years past.  In ""Birthright Part II"", we have a somewhat weak attempt at Worf showing a bunch of Klingon prisoners what it means to be Klingon after years of captivity under Romulans.  Season 6 also integrates the Cardassians a little better since DS9 started up this same time, with episodes, ""Chain of Command, I & II"" and ""The Chase"".  And then of course the season ending cliff-hanger ""Descent"" deals with the ""individuality"" Borgs led by Lore.
However even the non-classic adversary episodes are nice strong Trek-ish stories involving the growing Trek universe.
""Second Chances"" introduces us to William Riker's twin clone ""Tom Riker"" which was Levar Burton's directing debut.  Be sure and watch the extras on Disc 7 for more info on this episode.
But anyway, I would recommend Season 6 to anyone who wants to see just how great TNG really was.",1039737600,30,1640,4.712280701754386
7959777,5,B000063V8U,"We have been watching Star Trek: The Next Generation with our kids slowly over the past three years. They are under 10 and generally we like to limit the amount of violence and intensity they see on TV. We have found Star Trek to be generally appropriate for them (there are occasional scenes we skip) and the ideas the show deals with are so interesting to discuss with them. So much better than watching mindless violence or intensity on TV. It is fast paced enough to engage them (and us, the parents), but slow enough that it doesn't overwhelm their senses and there is a lot of dialogue and many interesting ideas to think about and discuss. In general, I would suggest this for the 7 and up crowd (depending on maturity of the children) to be watched with parents so parents can process with their kids. We've really enjoyed it and highly recommend it as a quality show with limited sexual undertones and limited violence.",1526342400,,928,4.596385542168675
