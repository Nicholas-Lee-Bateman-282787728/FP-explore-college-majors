8559190,3,B00AYEUP70,"I rarely endorse Alpha Video products, but when it comes to Edgar Kennedy there is no alternative.

Alpha has now reduced themselves to producing burned DVD-Rs instead of pressed DVDs.  That said, lets talk about the amateurish transfers.  For the most part these are good condition 16mm films telecine'ed on someone's home film transfer system, not professional film transfers.  Some shorts have a slight greenish tint, others have a purple tint, one has tints that switch back & forth in the middle of a scene.  All films appear to have been transferred to 3/4"" video tape and that old tape was used to author this DVD.

One short, ""A QUITE FORTH"" inserts VHS tape footage for missing scenes in their 3/4"" tape master. The trouble is that they missed a missing scene and there is an abrupt jump from Edgar milking a cow to Edgar running up to a picnic table chasing his brother-in-law.  We never know why he chased him.

Two other shorts ""CLOCK WISE"" & ""IT'S YOUR MOVE"" were transferred out of frame, see the notes below for details.

The audio could have used some cleaning up, the first short ""EARS OF EXPERIENCE"" has a lot of hiss & hum in the background, and when everyone is talking the level goes down. It seems that this film was transferred using an amateur audio limiter to try to keep steady audio levels, but this only brings up the noise and reduces the dialogue.

The rare shorts in this collection are not available on any VCI discs. Edgar's wife changed over the years, the actress playing her is the first name listed after the title below (all are approximately 18 minutes):
EARS OF EXPERIENCE (1938) w/ Florence Lake, Bill Franey
CLOCK WISE (1939)  w/ Vivian Oakland, Bill Franey ***film transfer is slightly out of frame at the top***
SUNK BY THE CENSUS (1940) w/ Vivian Oakland, Bill Franey, Anita Garvin
A QUIET FORTH (1941) w/ Sally Payne, Charlie Hall ***VHS tape was used to insert missing footage***Some footage still missing***
HOT FOOT (1943) w/ Pauline Drake, Bud Jamison ***This one is full of tape glitches***
IT'S YOUR MOVE (1945) w/ Florence Lake - REMAKE OF LAUREL & HARDY'S LOST FILM HATS OFF as Edgar & Brother-in-law carry a washing machine up a long flight of stairs. ***This one is out of frame on the bottom, you can see a white line***
YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY (1945) w/ Florence Lake,
MOTOR MANIACS (1946) w/ Florence Lake, Tom Kennedy
TROUBLE OR NOTHING (1946) w/ Florence lake

Chevrolet General Motors Drivers Safety Short with Edgar Kennedy:  A nice little RARITY that we are lucky to see today.
THE OTHER FELLOW (1937) a Jam Handy Production (8 minutes) - Edgar plays every driver in this comedy with a message. Well this is more of a novelty than a comedy.  ***This has several tape glitches***

I like Edgar Kennedy, mostly from his Hal Roach Studios days, but to say there is a classic in this bunch would be a great exaggeration.  This set is for the Edgar Kennedy fanatic.
We have no alternatives to this set, it is a must have for us fanatics.

Oh, and a word about the authoring.  It is difficult to get back to the title list once you start watching. The ""Menu"" button takes you back to the main page where you have to click on ""Chapters"".
There is a ""PLay All"" button, but when you select a specific short in the ""Chapters"" section it plays-all remaining shorts staring from the short you selected.",1377216000,8,3349,4.609427609427609
