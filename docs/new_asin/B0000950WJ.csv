1879148,5,B0000950WJ,"I am teaching, these days, a course on postcolonial literature in Mexico and, for my sutudents sake, I just wish this film had Spanish subtitles.  I believe it just mananages to reveal, to display, to express what is it to be living in the margin (or the multiple margins) of society.  If being a writer is not being an exemplary subject, being a poet is a bit less; if being from another culture is 'in', being native is a bit less; if sexuality is losing its axial presence, being 'gay', chicken or not, is also less 'important'.  This movie makes it clear that third cultures are out there.  That hybridity is the matter of the day.  Is it not politically transparent?  Well, nothing is anymore.  Life is burdened with ambivalences, ambiguities; with a multiplicity of meanings for each action, choice, value, word, and whatever we do.  The time of black and white (TV) should end.  The empire is being threatened from inside its own belly (as it happened with every single empire in history).  This movie is a must for whoever wishes to ilustrate how complicated life in the margins is.",1079740800,8,1090,4.659685863874346

1879150,5,B0000950WJ,"When I first started watching this film, I was not totally engaged in its early minutes and I wondered if I had bought a loser.  This is the kind of movie that has to be watched from start to finish.  There are so many messages in this movie and the Native American messenger carries messages for almost everyone who lives, breathes, and is human.  Life on today's reservations, be it the Spokane  or Pine Ridge in South Dakota is one of the America's dirty little secrets.  Reservation residents don't live very long, do battle with alcoholism and die from depression, hopelessness and sorrow every day. Harsh truths that few people know about.  In this movie we see the struggles of those who manage to leave the reservations, those that stay and those that try to return.  Leaving the reservation is only part of the battle, living in the outside world is still tough and Seymour, the lead in this movie, is gay on top of all else.  This is a powerful, powerful movie and some people won't want to hear what it has to say.
Michelle St. John gives a wonderful performance as a young woman of both white and native heritage.  Another struggle as she returns to her native roots and environment.  Michelle should sing more. She has an incredible voice, and an incredible, emotional delivery.  Her music and that of Swil Kanim, the violinist, Mouse...are wonderful.

1879151,5,B0000950WJ,"Another exquisite piece of art from Sherman Alexie.  This movie is more poetic than Smoke Signals, while oddly enough being less symbolic.  In this one Alexie shows what it's like to have made some of the choices he has, and acknowledges some of the things he's had to leave behind.
It's about accepting what can be and what can't, what is and what isn't, and living with the difference.
The movie wants to say something to you and you can get it because Alexie knows how to communicate ideas in words and pictures. You have to listen, though. The amusing and light-hearted additional commentary between Alexie and actor Evan Adams is informative and entertaining.  I like both these guys, even after listening to them talk about their movie and the choices they made putting it together.
The clue is in the title:  ""The business of fancydancing.""  Who would have thought an Indian (Alexie) would point out to everyone that Indian fancydancing (as well as poetry, the craft of the hero of the movie) is a ""business.""  Likewise film making, I assume.
For a long time I've believed Alexie should have had the Putlizer Prize simply for his title ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven.""  Those nine words say more than the majority of full-length novels, but I suppose Alexie can make a combination of words like that happen because he is first a poet. He's a poet in this movie too.
It's exquisite.",1071273600,10,1405,4.686991869918699
1879152,5,B0000950WJ,"It will probably be little known to many white folks who haven't spent a fair amount of time amongst the Native population or else on its fringes, but these depictions are pretty much mainstream. The way imagination, dream, and thoughts blend seamlessly with the ""real-word"" of flesh and stone, is telling, but closer to the intense world view that is here for the waking and dreaming.
The musical creativity was perfectly astounding, both the writing and performances/improvisations, ditto the sound editing, photography, and film editing. And the director used real people rather than trained actors - their stories thus meshed in a genuine way, exposing real native issues without even a hint of sugar-coating.
Some reviewers felt it was choppy - I experienced it as smooth. Sometimes the poetry was a bit unappealing, but that was, after all, part of what gave teeth to the story.  The [perceived choppiness] might have been a response as part of the actuality of the rez experience and the ""Indian' world view, along with the social interactivity of the personalities of Aristotle, Seymour, Mouse, and the rest. It's clearly not a defect of the screenwriting or the direction of the film. The film has a wonderful pace and rhythm throughout.
Yes, the content is intentionally disturbing - then again maybe not intentionally - in the sense that it's not a contrivance, it doesn't come off that way. It's more the way things could/would naturally move and develop given the circumstances - there's nothing even remotely implausible here.
An unstated theme is the way the scenes seem to reel around - so much like the experience of fancy dancing. This style of powwow dancing/costuming that was at its height around the time the principals in this story would have been coming of age. (Currently - grass dancing for boys and young men, and jingle dancing for girls and young women - are the newer, more prevalent styles). And we can't forget one of the fiddle pieces Mouse intermittently plays (along with the classical and emotionally wrenching distillations of powwow or medicine songs) - it sounds like a reel to me, maybe even the famous Virginia Reel. In a most essential way, the collection of intermittent fancy dance sequences and related songs and recitations - always filmed in darkness, as if in an imaginative sphere/space - this is an underlying modus operandi of the story and of its depiction.
Mouse's violin improvisations are a wonder to behold. Some of the imaginative sequences with him and Seymour or Aristotle were brilliant cross-cultural and/or intensely revealing re-inventions of the traditional native performance practices. And there is some of the best improvisational-style singing I have heard in any genre - even to the point of surpassing many of the better flamenco singers.
Aristotle [in both his singing and his acting] was particularly skillful at portraying every emotional nuance, from searing intensity to the subtle, profoundly spiritual - such that the experiences depicted may be felt to jump right out from the screen and to swirl around the viewer. And it's part of who the actor is depicting that he is totally fluid - uncanny, almost unpredictable in the way he moves from one state to the next - a thorough master like Coyote [the trickster god/goddess], and never ever unconvincing.
And finally - to the credit of the project as a whole, special effects are never overly blatant, which is the way one should proceed when glimpsing this culture where everything is as it seems. (Yeah right, there's always something seething just beneath the surface, just before the next event is to occur.) This is not one person's story, but is rather a collection of anecdotal knowledge, visionary gleanings, where oftentimes one person's dream fades into another's reality, and wondering are they the same?
There are some astounding depictions of shared experiences of two or more people, more candid and potent than the average well-scrubbed Hollywood actors ever come close to reaching into. Witness the brief love scenes; and one of the deleted scenes, where Aristotle and Mouse's blonde ex-girlfriend are having a long conversation - call it a confrontation.
And when the women sing, solo or in pairs/ensembles!!!!!!",1069977600,18,4257,5.081428571428572
1879153,4,B0000950WJ,"I'm a middle aged white woman who loves Alexie's work so I was excited to buy this movie.  Although it is rough in places, overall it is a good effort.  Alexie can be confrontational, and this semi-autobiographical film does not romaticize Indians nor does it sugar coat their lives.  I found parts of it hard to watch, but we members of the majority culture need this slap in the face. Alexie wanted to make his own film and quickly discovered that if he was going to work with Hollywood to do it, he would have to make compromises.  Instead, he decided to totally finance, write and direct it himself, use local Seattle actors and crew, and shoot it digitally.  The result is definitely not mainstream cinema, and not even indie cinema, but something more in the vein of Dogme.  This is not a happy film, but definitely a worthwhile and powerful experience.",1061856000,14,859,4.618421052631579

1879155,4,B0000950WJ,"Although the pacing is choppy, ""The Business of Fancydancing"" is haunting and powerful. Successful poet Seymour Polatkin returns to his rez for a friend's funeral and faces harsh criticism for the way he used his people for his subjects, then abandoned them. Evan Adams as Seymour is humorous, sly, confused, and finally shattered by his choices. Strong performances by Gene Tagaban as Aristotle Joseph, who serves as Seymour's conscience, and Swil Kanim as Mouse, the mocking, witty friend who dies. He's also a superb violinist. Michele St. John shines as Seymour's early love interest and indigenous singer who has chosen to live on the rez.
Alexie mocks himself as he poses the question, ""What's it like when you talk and white people listen?""
I recommend this film to anyone who wants to understand cultural disjointedness and search for self-identity.",1038441600,41,857,5.172661870503597
1879156,4,B0000950WJ,"Northwest author, director, poet, producer, activist, and humorist Sherman Alexie gathered a group of his friends together and they ""made a movie"" or they almost did. Falling a little short of the mark of a polished and finished film, nevertheless this movie gives us a series of tableaus that are both striking and emotionally charged, challenging us to ""understand"" our Indian brothers. This lovely and sad picture tackles many of Alexie's favorite themes, like life on the Rez, substance abuse, racism, native heritage and coveting of the ""old ways"", a child's eye view of parental alcoholism, struggle for meaning in an ignorant and non-caring world, and the driving need some Indians have to return to the Rez, to ""make a difference"", juxtaposed to the pulsating need others have to stay away, to build new lives amongst the white eyes; and something new -sexuality.

Evan Adams, long identified as Thomas Builds-the-Fire from that excellent Alexie adaptation, SMOKE SIGNALS (1998), stretched his creative impulses to portray Seymour Polatkin -who was a very successful gay poet,  and who happened to live with a paleface ""life partner"". ""In the before time,"" Seymour tells his book store audience, ""Homosexuals were completely accepted by other Indians, treated as special, like the crazy ones, or the disabled; cherished and protected. Homophobia was something Indians had to learn from the white men."" That, I suppose, and firewater. Evans, as an actor, is right up front about his own homosexuality, so the character of Seymour is an interesting mix if Alexie and himself; heartfelt and accurate, like a sound thump between the eyes.

Alexie has been criticized for ""revealing"" too much angst, pain, and sorrow relative to his kin's alcoholism, and his own -illuminating the substance abuse that runs rabid and rampant through all of the Indian nations. His character in FANCYDANCING, Mouse, dies of an overdose. He contends that he is simply writing from his actual experience, from his life -that he ""speaks the whole truth"" regardless of the literary and symbolic consequences. I support and would defend his artistic license for introspection. Reading his poetry, novels, essays, and narratives is like taking a crash course in ""Indianism""--and that is spoken like a honest-to-God Indian Wannabe, I remind myself painfully.

Evan Adams is extremely effective as Polatkin the conflicted gay poet, the butt warrior estranged from the Spokane Rez, who is pulled back for his cousin's funeral. Alexie enjoyed himself with the casting, spraying the mix with diverse ethnicity. Adams, who is a full-blooded Indian, looks very Asian in the role. Michelle St. John, wonderful as Agnes, the school teacher who returned to the reservation is half Jewish. Gene Tagaban, playing the volatile Aristotle Joseph, looked every inch the stoic archetypical Indian, great sweeping long black locks, fairly tall, muscular, looked great in buckskin, with that great Injun ""profile"", actually is half Pilipino. Swil Kanim, who played the fiddler Mouse, looked more Cajun than Spokane, and grew facial hair like an Arab. .

For some odd reason this interesting Independent film after it worked the Festival Circuit, winning a few awards, just dropped out of sight and was never widely distributed. I have a friend who was in it, and he brought it to my attention. Thank God there is a DVD of it. For Sherman Alexie fans, it is a must see, and for the rest of folks -give yourselves a tasty treat and sit down for this 103 minutes of film, and it will ""move"" you.",1195516800,5,3552,5.117241379310345
1879157,3,B0000950WJ,"This film is worth seeing--for one thing, as others have mentioned, Evan Adams is fabulous, and the portrait of Polatkin's ambivalent struggle to reconcile his ambition with his heritage is a moving one.  The poems are also fun, although some of them--like the one Polatkin recites for his white lover in the bathtub, which echoes poems by Alexie about a white lover--are presented as being glib and insincere, as though Alexie were mocking himself.  That for me was the heart of the problem with this movie.  I never really felt absolutely in tune with it, because it seemed like the movie was  trying to distance us from Polatkin, to mock his ambition and self-centeredness, at the same time that it was trying to get us to identify with him.  For me the most moving scene is the one in which Polatkin tells the interviewer the story of his sister's death and how the following Christmas he received a dictionary, along with his mother's admonition to use it to get off the rez.  The scene concludes with Polatkin telling the interviewer ""So don't tell me what I can write about"" or who or what I should be, or something to that effect.  This to me was the emotional crux of the movie.  It wasn't about Mouse, or why Mouse died, or Aristotle.  It was Alexie saying, My pain is my pain and I have the right to say what I want to say and to be who I am.  But then the other characters are just there as props, and Polatkin's gayness is a metaphor for the bicultural bind of the literate Indian, not a genuine attempt to flesh out a portrait of a gay Native character.  Something about that doesn't sit right with me. And the way the relationship between Polatkin and his white lover is portrayed is also offensive.  Even the sensuality between them seems forced, put on, even though Adams reeks of sexy through the whole film.(It's funny to see how hot he can be, after his performance as the ever geeky Thomas in Smoke Signals.)  But the relationship between the two men is shown to be one between 2 very self-centered, unsympathetic people, and that's a turnoff for me, in life as in film.",1193356800,10,2091,4.514588859416445
1879158,3,B0000950WJ,"Yea, I really liked Smoke Signals.  A lot.  Love Alexie's poetry, too.  This movie has its moments, and thank god there are no bad wigs in this one, but it seemed too self conscious and redundant in some of the themes of SA's first film.  I did enjoy the poetry, but it seemed an easy way to get poems into a film--write a screenplay about a poet.  Still, good acting, well filmed, and good enough to keep me watching until the end.",1177200000,3,432,4.219512195121951
1879159,5,B0000950WJ,"Alexie's second film, and the first one in which he served as both screenwriter and director, is quite simply one of the most intriguing and compelling works of art--in any medium--of the past decade.  Alexie's tragicomic humor and insightful wisdom endure the pain and sadness of Mouse's untimely death.  Alexie shows us that crosscultural mourning practices (from Spokane Indian chants and sweetgrass through readings from 2nd Chronicles by a Unitarian minister to the chanting of the Jewish Kaddish prayer for the dead) help us to grieve, to reflect, and to celebrate our shared condition of being human on a very small planet.",1176163200,2,630,5.166666666666667
1879160,3,B0000950WJ,Good movie as far as the story line goes- Shows that being gay trancends all races. Many indian movies depict scenes that go back & forth throughout time but in the case of this movie the shifting back & forth kinda complicated matters somewhat. It appears to be a movie that may require several viewings to be completely understood.,1155686400,3,333,4.661016949152542
1879161,5,B0000950WJ,"I may have watched this movie 5 or 6 times.  Every time, I see more references, more allusions, and I intend to continue watching it. Here is a list of my impressions.

  Fancydancing as a euphemism for the pressures of trying to keep hopping through life in time to the accelerating beat while staying on your toes, no misteps allowed, and when the music suddenly stops, you must also stop, or lose.  Trained to stop on red, or to hold oneself back, whether anyone is there to enforce it or not, or whether they have the means to keep going or not.  The white girlfriend of Mouse who has run to the Rez to hide, and speaks more like someone on the Rez than does Seymour, is more a part of the community than he.  The graininess of many of the Rez scenes contrasting with the ethereal quality of those in the city.  Gallows humor, and the most realistic funeral I've ever seen on film.  I love the interview sections, representing a distillation of the outside (read: non-Native, literary, academic, etc.) critique he has received, and his reply, so I differ from another reviewer on that.  And then it gives me goosebumps to watch Swill Kanim in the Lysol sandwich scene.

  Of course there is more, but these are what most come to mind.  This is a movie for people who like to think and feel.",1134604800,6,1294,4.427966101694915
1879162,4,B0000950WJ,"While we as a country are discovering/acknowledging the struggles of the different sects within the Middle East, tribal differences that are longstanding and divisive and painful, along comes another sensitive story about Native Americans in this country and how the scars of past and ongoing abuses of our 'reservation resolution' have affected the original peoples of this land.  Sherman Alexie, a fine poet and novelist, has transformed his written works into a film that showers the viewer with insights into a problem about which few are cognizant - intratribal differences that provide schisms within the only  root that binds.

Seymour Poltakin (the very talented Evan Adams) is a famous poet who happens to be both Native American and gay.  He is called back to his Reservation in Spokane, Washington for the funeral of his childhood friend Mouse (Swil Kanim) only to confront all of the reasons he has left the Reservation for the 'white man's world' where he has found both financial and emotional success.  Seymour's best friend Aristotle (Gene Tagaban) had originally left the Reservation to go to college with Seymour, but quickly soured to the prejudiced outside world and returned to his Reservation and to an unfortunate life of alcoholism and drug abuse.  The bulk of the storyline revolves around how these two once devoted friends parted ways, the philosophies of each are explored, and though Seymour finds moments of love in his home space, he is still content to return to his white man lover and his life he has chosen.

There are many very tender and moving moments in this film: when Seymour is in conversation with Agnes (Michelle St. John) and when Agnes intones the Indian chants and songs at the funeral; Seymour's dialogues with his lover; scenes of quiet while Aristotle abuses himself with drugs; the weaving in and out of the beautiful dancing that flows through the film.  The problem with the movie is the disparity of approaches in telling the story: an interview situation between Rebecca Carroll and Evan Adams is well written but breaks the mood of the poetic form of the story.  The film is obviously low budget and in this case, for this viewer, the rough hand-held camera technique adds a quality of reality to what we are watching.

The overall effect at the end of the film is a pang of pain in the heart having witnessed the generations of 'isolation' and the segregation of the Native Americans into spaces both geographical and sociological that have undermined a tremendously valuable asset to our history.  That role of shame is one that will never leave us, and it is a gift that artists like Sherman Alexie can bring this to the public's attention.  Recommended.

1879163,5,B0000950WJ,"Sherman Alexie is simply an amazing writer.  His poems are amazing, his movies are amazing...  and yet I'm a white guy.  How do I know how true they are to The Rez?  Besides, how do Native Americans feel about his portrayal of them?

After all, that's a very difficult matter to contend with.  Some of the few Native Americans filmmakers that deal with this issue are often forced to purposefully make their movies self-conscious (including cameras in them, etc.) just to show that they recognize that their portrayal is still through a popular, Anglo ethnocentric medium.  Besides that, Native Americans aren't just one group, one ethnicity... each tribe is a nation, and they all have separate constructions of their identity.  One Indian nation may be represented well in a film, and it confuses the white viewer as to how Indians ""really are"" because other nations ""aren't like that.""

Thus, this film.  Sherman Alexie has bound to have suffered criticism for making Indians portrayable to white folk, and this movie shows a Native American writer who has forsaken his tribe in order to write all about it, keeping in mind that the pop culture needs a tragic Indian, one that's half-white in order to relate to the white community, one that's attracted to white people as well.  The entire film is a series of mirrors reflecting it's own problem of identity, which most of the time becomes really tedious but this time is actually really well done.

One of the ways he succeeds is in admitting the simple truth: writers are frauds.  Their writing stems from real pain, but in the end they are all just pathological liars.  They make up stories either to make themselves seem more interesting, or to pretend their pain is okay.

And the pop culture eats it up while the ones that feel that pain are ignored.

1879164,5,B0000950WJ,"Poetically intriguing! I am sure Alexie will be criticized for showing the ugly side of reservation life along with the beauty, but this film sticks with you. It addresses all the angles. It shows the intra-tribal prejudice that happens when someone leaves the rez and becomes successful, and the ones who could have, but chose not to. The images of childhood innocence woven with gasoline huffing and Lysol sandwiches are sad and beautiful at the same time. The great dialog, Alexie's writing, great casting and cinematography make this all around good. It  has more ""meat"" than Smoke Signals, I highly recommended it.",1087948800,18,619,5.068627450980392

Alexie directed this like a composer would a beautiful, tragic suite.  I found myself laughing and crying, and also thinking about the universal concept of identity while watching this film.  It doesn't matter if you are from the Rez, or from NYC.  Returning to your home after breaking away is hard for all of us--especially if rejection is inevitable.
I think this is definitely a groundbreaking film.  I don't say this simply because Alexie is a Native writer, filmmaker, producer and director.  I say this because the film is a brilliant examination of the human condition, done in an unaffected, realistic and straightforward way.

The Native identity topics don't relate to how other tribes see themselves collectively. How tribes relate to their culture is different in various areas of North and South America.
In addition his works are almost anti-gay. I don't mean homophobic. In his works the characters never value the gay relations internally. They are just about only same-sex flings but don't show how gay people can have emotional loving relationships. The main character in the film shows no emotions for his gay relationship, it is almost an empty one. Sherman Alexie seems not to see how the gay (Native) relationships are not just physical relationships or acts. Gays relationships are just as full of emotion and life as any other, and are also just as strongly bonded.  He seems to never include that thought in his works, even if the characters are gay or bi, as if though same sex emotional love wasn't valued. To be honest a number of other ethnic gay culture films show this fully. The Native gay community is also very different, including a number of circles of native gay friends supporting each other which is not the loner idea he writes in his works.",1402531200,,1257,4.873831775700935

A lot of my Native friends don't like Sherman Alexie but he does have good points, and If you are non-natvie and never lived on the reservation (or educated about it- if thats possible) you might not understand it very much. I believe it's directed toward the Native audience, so read up a little on Native culture and history before you watch if you know nothing about Natives and the Rez.",1371686400,2,552,4.475247524752476
7989355,2,B0000950WJ,"I'm probably not in the right demographic for this movie. Although I am gay, I am not an American Indian, and this movie depends heavily on an appreciation of their culture, their history and (if this movie is at all authentic) their overwhelming love of melodrama.

Not a single word in the very stilted and contrived screenplay sounded to me like an actual human being talking, but like a person reading a proclamation about something very profound. The many poetry readings, funeral speeches, etc&mdash;even ordinary conversations between lovers and friends&mdash;sound so forced and pretentious that they're nearly unbearable. That's probably because the movie was written by a poet about himself. When the same poet also directs the movie, the combination practically guarantees a mediocre result.

Very, very few successful movies are written and directed by people whose subject is their own lives and whose primary interest is in poetry rather than in movie-making. In fact, I can't think of a single one.

If Sherman Alexie had allowed someone else to write and direct his story, it might have worked very well, because it's not an uninteresting story&mdash;but this movie doesn't work at all, not for me. It's too unnatural, and Native Americans ought to be MORE natural than the rest of us, not less.

7989356,4,B0000950WJ,"The Business of Fancydancing is the story of two men from the Spokane Reservation in Washington state.  The story examines both of their lives and how these former friends' lives have taken completely different paths.  Seymour Polatkin left the reservation, went to college, and became a successful poet writing about his life and the lives of other from the rez.  Aristotle Joseph dropped out of college and moved back to the reservation to work in the Uranium mines; becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol, and growing more and more resentful of the white society he could not succeed in.  Sixteen years after leaving the rez, Seymour must come back for the wake of his childhood friend, Mouse.  This forces Seymour to confront Aristotle and many of the others he left behind, yet continues to write about in his books.
Alexie does excellent work portraying the struggle of identity for his main character, who is a gay American Indian poet living in the city and traveling back to the reservation where he grew up.  Alexie also touches on the hardship of life on the rez and the issues of poverty and addiction that face many Native Americans.
My favorite parts of this film include the sections of poetry, dance, and music that appear between scenes and the hand-held film style that documents Aristotle, Mouse, and their lives on the reservation.",1302652800,,1351,4.877729257641922

I'll warn you that this will not everyone's cuppa bitter root tea--about as far from Hollyweird as you can get...so if you don't like non-Hollyweird films, don't expect the usual and you may still enjoy this. (Caveat: I rather like Hollyweird...just not all the time.) I would call it the best film about poetry and living in two worlds I've ever seen, but I like poetry and live in two worlds. Still, you might like it even if you don't like poetry or live in two worlds. (Although you have to have gone to a poetry reading or author lecture in a white university or artsy fartsy literary venue to fully appreciate the hilarious intercut scenes of Seymour doing his schtick.) I don't quite know how to say it, but this film totally captured (at least for me) the fear of any artist/writer/etc who leaves where they came from and writes/makes art about their people and is celebrated as an outsider but is never accepted for what they want to be accepted for at home... of being found out as an impostor or being not-accepted by their people in that role. I used to call this my My Name is Asher Lev fear (although I admit never finishing that book), and now I think I have to call it my Seymour Polatkin Fear. (Maybe that makes no sense. eh.)

Anyway. If you dig Evan Adams, he's prit-ty awesome as a Gay Urban Indian Poet...yep. One thing I would want to point out, though, is that even though this film is often categorized as a Gay/Lesbian film and even won some related award, I would not label it like that at all. Yes, the main character is gay, and even as inherently navel-gazing as poetry is (and Evan's Seymour character is), this isn't about gay identity angst (in my opinion). And I don't know who put the tag in here, but I'm sorry, this isn't about 'interracial homoerotica.' I wouldn't want to label it with any other Blockbuster label, but if I had to, I'd say it's a really, really Good Indian Movie about people.

I don't know what took me so long to see this...when it came out and run through the festival circuit I remember trying to get the university theater to run it, and it never worked out. But I bought the soundtrack then, worth it if only for Michelle St. John and Jennifer Kriesberg (the high-voiced chica from Ulali) singing one of the most beautiful songs ever to end a movie with)...but the 49's and Swil Kanam's stuff with Gene Tabagan is awesome, too. It was great to finally see the context of the songs.",1224633600,2,2524,4.4728850325379605

The manner in which the content is presented, makes the viewer become part of it and its information.  There are no comments to say that this is what should be done...only what exists.
