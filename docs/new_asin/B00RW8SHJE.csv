6936169,4,B00RW8SHJE,"This wasn't the greatest season of the shows run,but had some good ones as well. ""go fund yourself"" ""the cissy"" and ""cock magic"" i think are the best of the season. I also just loved that they put recurring themes throughout the season. Randy as lorde was absolutely hilarious and one of the best things that matt and trey has done since day one of the show. The whole rehash two parter was funny. I liked the whole holograms running around town and having michael jackson back as a hologram was funny........but they just used pewdiepie way way way too much. I used to watch his stuff,but finally came to my senses and stopped watching his channel. Other than that this was a pretty good season and can't wait to pick this one up and officially have all 18 seasons on dvd!!! Also season 19 is on the horizon as well AND the show has been renewed up until the 23rd season!!! A lot of SP still to enjoy!!",1440892800,5,903,4.349112426035503
6936170,4,B00RW8SHJE,I love south park me and my husband have every season out so far and season 18 was great my only thing was I didn't like the rehash stuff but other than that it's amazing :D,1437350400,,173,3.8333333333333335
6936171,4,B00RW8SHJE,"Every time I think South Park has run it's course  they come out with an episode that makes me want to ROFLMAO.  Their still some misses in this season, but I won't name them as either you will agree with me or not.  Some people love this show so much that any criticism is blown off.  However as a person that has loved this show from the beginning and has bought every dvd collection that has come out, I feel I have every right to voice my opinion on it. This season I would rate a solid B. I won't go into a play by play of every episode  their plenty of critics that do that during the run on tv.
Like the simpsons  they keep it freash by keeping up with whats going on in the world daily.  I think the problem with both series  is no matter the story  they have to stay true to their charcters and after a while no matter the story  its really the same thing over and over.  I think south park becasue its more cutting the simpsons still has some life in it  but hope, unlike the simpsons, they close their run before they start losing their audience",1436745600,3,1056,4.072815533980583
6936172,5,B00RW8SHJE,"Hope this set comes out soon! This season differs from the previous in that there is continuity between episodes, in that events from one episode carry on into the next. In Season 18, the boys form a start up a kickstarter company called the ""Washington Redskins,"" Randy Marsh reveals his secret identity as pop sensation Lorde, South Park goes gluten-free, Timmy starts his own taxi service, and holograms threaten to change the face of the entertainment industry! For them, it's all just a part of growing up in South Park. It wasn't one of the show's greatest seasons, but it still shows that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are still capable of delivering some of the greatest pop culture satire that the world has ever seen. They're still on the top of their game here, and it shows that all of their work on The Stick of Truth didn't get in the way of what they do best. I'm hoping that the DVD set is released sometime soon, and that Seasons 19 and 20 aren't too far behind!",1436313600,11,976,4.48876404494382

South Patk is best when they are fearless. Hopefully with 2016 election, South Park will be unrelenting towards Hillary and Trump, and mocking our electoral system like they used to do. In S18e2 Where's My Country Gone is case in point. I really enjoyed Mr. Garrison's portrayal of Trump.

6936199,1,B00RW8SHJE,"The problem with South Park these days is that Matt and Trey have run out of ideas and so they snatch them right out of what is trending in society at large. Season 18 will join seasons 16 and 17 as the THREE WORST EVER. I think if the writers have no more inspiration than what we are seeing then they might as just kill the series. It seems they have lost their joy for being juvenile and devilish. In the past the writers wrote stories that were so politically incorrect and even taboo as to get people talking about the controversial cartoon characters. Now we just have some potty mouthed kids taking part in the culture that is all around them. The writers and the characters are going through the motions and the result is the show has become quite BAD. I have every season of South Park. I've been for and against the writers at times. Sometimes Matt and Trey went way over the line but lately the writers are just boring the hell out of me. And now we have TEN EPISODE seasons and not even half of the episodes are fun to watch. Anyway, I'm only expressing my COMPLETE disappointment in the hopes that the writers can regain their sense of humor. The show has LOST what made it great. I haven't seen any of season 19 but after I do I'll probably be back here pissing and moaning. Come on writers. Get it together and give us 14 episodes again too.",1468281600,,1356,4.30078125

6936219,5,B00RW8SHJE,"-Update-

So there was a couple episodes on the second disc that makes me want to retract my prior review. I re-watched the entire season after amd wasn't as annoyed by the background drama music.  I repost with 5 stars.
--- --- ---
Apparently Matt and Trey decided to try something new. And I personally consider it an epic fail.

The script and story line and everything we have come to expect from South Park...however every episode (at least on the forelst disc) has an annoying background music to add ""drama/suspense/whatever"" in virtuallu every scene. I found it so annoying that i havemt even bothered to attempt watching the second disc. (Which reminds me...i don't care for the double disc...i miss the 3 disc boxes. Comedy Central only gave them 10 episodes for season 18.)

None the less I am big fan ( not Cartman big but metephorically big) of South Park. I just hope that season 19 does not have the annoying background music that distracts from the script and dialog. (The music doesnt distort the voices, it just becomes ...well it becomes like that annoying radio playing  at just the right volume in the next room in the room to distract you while you're trying to enjoy your favorite show... ... ...or an even better example would be those black lines on top amd bottom or left and right of tv screen...only for your ears).

I dunno. You'll hear what i mean.",1457568000,,1378,4.627049180327869

19 is a masterpiece so far. I can't wait to own that one; a true five star season. But this is the one where South Park reinvented itself, and it's damn good (and funny). As the Simpsons continue to plod its own corpse along and Family Guy is as uninspired as ever, South Park is once again just as culturally relevant as ever.",1448928000,5,590,4.315315315315315
