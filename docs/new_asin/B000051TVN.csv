1388066,3,B000051TVN,Very well written...a good movie for people who have lived through the British era in India and not of pure Indian decent.  The struggle to find ones place between the Pompus British who over took India and the Anglo Indian wanting so much to belong.,1210723200,,250,4.555555555555555
1388067,5,B000051TVN,"Servile, cunning, ingratiating and conniving... these adjectives pretty much sum up Mary's character for me. Sexually prudish, yet ambitious for some social standing, she sees her opportunity come in the form of a newborn while working as a nurse.  The mother is British, the baby premature.  The mother is not producing milk, and Mary takes the infant to a crippled wet nurse where the baby is eventually restored to health.  Lily, the mother, offers her a job as an ayi in the house, which Mary of course seizes upon.  Eventually she poisons the mind of her mistress against her tried and longstanding man-servant, such does her influence become.

On the other hand, her mistress, dope that she is, is susceptible to all of this.  Which I found to be a frustrating part early on in the movie.  Rest assured her stupidity will be corrected later in the movie.  By the time that it is though, I was almost starting to marvel at Mary..  She is one twisted lady - though her mental extremism is largely the product of colonial history combined with her own culture and personal background.

Mary is not a likable character - she's a character, all right, but likable probably isn't one of the words that'll come to mind when you recall her.  And yet this very well-done character study of a movie wouldn't have been the intriguing piece of work that it was without her.  The movie never asks you to like her, but what she is says something.  And no, I wouldn't call this movie satire.  Just as I wouldn't call ""A Passage to India"" satire (which, BTW, is an excellent movie - even if you didn't like this one).  There was only one scene which made me wonder, and that was when the new butler (a relative presumably) makes his entrance.  We see him pulling flowers out of some flower pots (plant and all).  Later, Mary scolds him ""I just told you to pick some flowers"".  That one scene was almost spoofish (of drunken relatives?).  But overall I didn't feel this was satire.  If it was, what was being satirized?  British colonialism against the backdrop of their religion? and some of the people who partially embraced it? the mindset of a nation that allowed them to set up camp there in the first place?  No, this wasn't a satire for me, although this movie is very revealing on those topics. Christianity, for example, seemed to fuel Mary's prudish ultra-conservativism - however, she herself was born of a mixed marriage of British father and Indian mother.

This movie was a lot more engaging than I thought it would be. Of course, you spend a lot of that time being appalled at Mary's gall, and wanting to give her ""madam"" a swift kick! Which may be why this got low reviews from some. Still, shot in south India, the scenery is stunning and based on that alone, it'd be hard to give this picture anything less than 3 stars. Add to that, very fine production, first-rate acting and a story that left me somewhat moved, or at least in awe of the way her twisted mind worked.  And while the way she is is obviously an extreme, there's something in it, some act of repression that seems to touch on something found in most cultures and societies or attitudes, for better or for worse..  No this was an interesting story.  Cotton Mary said something.",1207699200,4,3249,4.577854671280277
1388068,4,B000051TVN,"I was somewhat dismayed to read the negative reviews of this movie. First, we MUST take into account the movie-making team responsible for this film, a team working together, historically, on so many films of similar theme over the years:the British in India. Their effort is unique, this turn, because the action rolls a scant seven years after the last British Viceroy left India to its own self-rule... after a two hundred year ""guardianship"". What was left in the wake of those two hundred years? ... and please remember the team crafting this movie. The dynamics... the dramaturgy of this movie is secondary, and serves, only, to illustrate history. The central figure, CottonMary, a bi-racial woman, more Indian than ""White"", but believing herself to be British to the bone... a sentiment NOT shared by the decaying British colonials (holding tightly on to their quickly-vanishing past in India), is foiled, constantly, in all attempts to claim the identity she feels to be her own. The British regard her as an outsider to their world, fit to be only a servant, and her fellow Indians are at odds with her claim to be more British than Indian and are equally at odds with what they see as her affectations, underscoring her efforts to distance herself from them... her Indian counterparts. Too frequently, do they feel her disgust for their Indian ways. And so in the end, the central figure is ""no where"", neither here nor there, eshewed by all... totally isolated, and pays a terrible personal price for trying to claim her identity as she sees it to be.
I do understand that this film is subtle, but for any viewer at all familiar with M-I's body of work, this film, as part of an oeuvre, is very important, as it captures the wreckage of a significant chapter in Indian history... it is the denoument of that experience, and an entirely fitting and defining ""end"" snapshot of a two hundred year chapter that shaped the sub-continent.",1170288000,,1944,4.823353293413174
1388069,4,B000051TVN,"But tell me why that cover on the DVD/Video sleeve? Yes, there is an extra marital but nothing like THAT cover. I found the movie absorbing, beautifully filmed and interesting historically/colonialism.",1162166400,3,201,5.516129032258065
1388070,2,B000051TVN,"This 1999 Merchant-Ivory production is set in India in 1954.  A wealthy British woman gives birth to a small baby.  As she is not able to breastfeed, the hospital nurse, named Cotton Mary, who proudly proclaims that she is half-English herself, makes the woman dependent upon her and moves into the rich woman's house as a servant. Cotton Mary never tells the mother how she is feeding the baby, but the viewer watches Cotton Mary take the baby in a boat each day to visit her own crippled sister who is a wet nurse and lives in a house which the British refer to as an ""alms house"", where disabled and aged elderly people live.
The plot is ridiculous.  How can a mother show no interest at all in how her baby is being fed?  Certainly a tiny baby needs to be fed more than once a day. And certainly, they had baby bottles and formula in 1954.  The woman's husband, who is a philandering and uncaring journalist doesn't care either.  And their older daughter who is about eight years old keeps the secret of these clandestine feedings.
There's more to the story of course.  There are the snobby British colonials and the legacy of colonialism.  There is the trusted Indian servant who is forced out of his job because of the lies of Cotton Mary.  There is Cotton Mary's niece who has an affair with the husband.  But mostly the film is about Cotton Mary herself and her descent into mental illness.
The story is awful but the film still had a few things going for it.  One was the great acting job of Madhur Jeffrey cast as Cotton Mary.  Another was the setting and excellent photography that transported me to a time and place in India that Merchant-Ivory does so well.  But the story itself is preposterous and  much too long and boring.",1074988800,8,1739,4.479365079365079
1388071,1,B000051TVN,"I love Greta Scacchi in most of her movies. I have to take exception to this one. This movie is so boring , one of the reason is that you do not care about any of the role played by the actors. All of the characters dipected in this movie are of
no interest at all . You cannot have any sympathy for any of them they are whithout a story . I have look at that movie 3 times and I cannot find anything good to say about it. Greta Scacchi who is good and sometime exellent in her movies is such a bore in this one. Don't have any great expectations if you buy this movie.",1030665600,6,569,3.830508474576271
1388072,5,B000051TVN,"From the outset, I offer two cautions: the film is primarily satire, not the tepid bourgeois drama one typically associates with Merchant Ivory and, two, the steamy picture on the cover of the DVD has little to do with the main plot of the film.
 These cautions are important because if you really like those earnest, self-important, plodding PBS telenovellas like The Jewel in the Crown, you are unlikely to be happy with this sharp and original work.  Madhur Jaffrey gives a first-rate performance with the sort of creative adventurousness one usually associates more with live theater than commercial film.  Cotton Mary is not likeable, though she is funny;  it took guts for Jaffrey and Merchant not to sentimentalize the situation.  It almost certainly cost them box office.  But this is thoughtful film making and gutsy, hard as steel satire.  This is something other than the usual soft hearted and soft minded claptrap usually cranked out about postcolonial India.
One quibble:  it could have been shorter by at least 20 minutes.  For instance, the whole Charley's Aunt business could have been eliminated without any serious loss in content.",1020643200,14,1150,5.074468085106383
1388073,5,B000051TVN,"The movie takes place on the Malabar Coast in 1954, years after India gains its independence from Britain.  Cotton Mary, a hospital aide and Anglophile takes over the care of a sickly white infant sending it to her wheelchair-bound sister to breastfeed.  Mary decides upon herself to take over the English household of the infant's family playing on the mother's fatigue and blindness to what is going on around her (her husband's infidelity, for one thing); pilfering her wares and framing on Abraham, a long time servant to the woman's family; and telling tales of her family to impress the white people who are smug to her stories and the people of color.  Her scheme soon becomes too much for her to bear when she confronts the issue of race and class and herself individually.  In the end she nearly loses the respect of her family, who believed that they would one day meet the lady of the house.",979257600,14,902,4.654088050314465

7929596,4,B000051TVN,"This satirical comedy drama seems to be lost on pretty much everyone who has commented on it. And while the story might seem ridiculous for some viewers, it will not be for anyone who has spent time in India. It's not for everyone, but Ismael Merchant was a highly intelligent, well educated man, and he and his partner James Ivory were brilliant film makers, who knew India well. Merchant is Indian after all. The DVD cover art, which is not the original, has a great deal to do with the film, and confirms pretty much everything I've been saying. Some viewers just aren't watching. Ismael Merchant co-directed this film with Madhur Jaffrey. James Ivory had nothing to do with it.",1409184000,,681,4.683333333333334
7929597,3,B000051TVN,"Cinematography beautiful, and less sentimental than some Merchant/Ivory pieces. Some good acting, Greta Scacchi especially, but also nice cameo pieces from reliable character actors. I found Madhur Jaffrey a little bit over the top once her character began to fall to pieces, perhaps the fault of the script - to my ears the script was about the most problematic part of this movie. Too much of the dialogue was clunky. Not all bad, but I realized I would have loved to see how Ruth Prawer Jhabvala would have handled the script.",1408320000,2,529,4.824175824175824

7929601,1,B000051TVN,"Merchant Ivory became a trusted name with the quality of its early films. With this one it loses all credibility. Unlikeable or illogical characters and almost no story. Not much more I can say. Reviewers here who give this 5 stars just demonstrate what a minefield this website's review pages represent.

Karen Durbin at Mirabella magazine (now at Elle) said, ""Outstanding! A triumph!"" Kevin Thomas at Los Angeles Times said, ""A milestone! Splendid! Engrossing!"". Apparently credibility is the first casualty on the movie review gravy train.",1368576000,,542,5.3023255813953485
7929602,3,B000051TVN,"Without doubt, this film is a feast for the eyes, but not for the mind.

It has a simple plot.  A deluded Indian woman weedles her way into an upper class British home and she starts the process of eliminating established servants (their word, not mine) and replacing them with relatives (even by supplying her own sister as a wet-nurse) who would in turn make her more important in the household.  She succeeds until she pushes just a little bit too far then her world collapses.  She also destroys the British family in her fall from grace.

Beautifully filmed and the casting is absolutely perfect.  As in most Merchant Ivory films, the pace is slow, but determined (not wishy-washy).

The few brief moments of male frontal nudity was (to my eyes) an unexpected, exciting diversion in a somewhat orderly, sometimes dry production.",1262131200,,833,4.823943661971831
