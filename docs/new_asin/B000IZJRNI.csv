Most of the time (90 %) the quality is horrible, there are tons of Ads. Even if you bear with this garbage, you can see the defects with your naked eye; the visible smears, scratches etc. etc.
I have since returned the DVD but still waiting for the refund.

I saw this movie in one of indian's channels, and I liked the idea of the story and it was very very touching at the end which made me really weep I don't know if I am weak hearted person but its really made me weep.
What I dislike about it that how love is transformed in a critical stage which became so dangerous to subdue this feelings, I guess it happens in reality but it depends on different aspects of life. Which made me believe that moderation is very important to keep our balance in every matter of life.

Well I don't recommend it to those people who has emotional issues to watch it, it will make them feel bad at the end. But I loved it",1371686400,,779,4.019354838709678
8148034,3,B000IZJRNI,"Urmila's acting is one of many reasons to watch this film. Though it is not as good as I was expecting it to be, PTKK is worthy of praise due to the fact that a young director who had previously never sat behind a camera helms the project. Nevertheless, Verma's magic is clearly evident throughout and I am certain PTKK will be one of the better-quality movies to come out of Bollywood this year.",1302134400,,396,4.364864864864865
