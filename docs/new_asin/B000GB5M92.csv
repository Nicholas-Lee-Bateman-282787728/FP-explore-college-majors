2604236,2,B000GB5M92,"As a fan of the horror/exploitation genre, I saw ""Last House on the Left"". As disturbing as that movie is it does offer the revenge and retribution angle at the end which offers some solace to the audience. Also, it wasn't quite as sickenly graphic in its depictions of brutal violence. ""Choas"" even felt the need to subsitute the very effective rape scene in ""Last House on the Left"" with a truely puke worthy rape of a corpse scene.

On a positive note, the acting isn't bad. The victims are effective and the bad guys are believable. Its the changes to the script that are what ruins this movie. If it was a straight remake it may well have worked with this cast..

Where ""Last House on the Left"" left the viewer wanting to take a long shower, ""Choas"" leaves the viewer wanting to take a bath with a razor blade. Alas, this movie will not make it into my DVD collection.",1159315200,8,873,4.382716049382716
2604237,4,B000GB5M92,"Yes, this film could be considered a rip-off of Last House on the Left, but the brutal murders in this film are far more disturbing and powerful than anything in Last House. It's cruel and distasteful, but this film shakes emotions in people which few horror films do these days. It's not a great film, but for what it is, I think it accomplishes its goals. I'm a hardcore horror fan and the murder scenes made me recoil, they are so realistic.",1159142400,12,444,4.426829268292683
2604238,1,B000GB5M92,"Note to filmmakers: You can't manufacture controversy.

CHAOS is a movie made with all hyperbole and no talent. If you want proof, look no further than the cover art: Even when you take the graphic violence into account, it's far from the ""most brutal movie ever made"". In fact, it's nothing more than a rip-off of Wes Craven's grindhouse classic, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. That film may have been a spin on Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING, but CHAOS actually steals from its source scene-for-scene. In the end, it's the equivilant of the PSYCHO remake (minus that film's skill). It's a miracle these amateurish filmmakers weren't sued.

If you want a lesson on how NOT to make a movie, then watch this. If you want a good unintentional laugh (the DVD extras show the director in a morgue, wearing a wrestler's outfit and flexing his muscles), then watch this.

2604240,5,B000GB5M92,"After watching ""The Last House on the Left"" I was left breathless and stunned, blown away by Wes Craven's masterful remake of Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring."" It was one of the most gloriously violent, demented, and disturbing movies I had ever seen. I would never have thought that anyone could possibly make ""The Last House on the Left"" more disturbing. Well, I was wrong. ""Chaos"" has three times the brutality than Wes Craven could have ever dreamed up for his masterpiece. Necrophilia, over the top violence and gore, as well as some of the best dialogue that I have heard for a while in movies, ""Chaos"" was one of the most horrific experiences that I have had in movies for a while now. I give accolades to David DeFalco for not attempting to appeal to the masses and gain a greater profit by making a ""feel good"" movie with a happy ending, but, instead, choosing to push the boundaries of horror to make one of the most gratuitously violent, sick, and disgusting movies I have ever seen.

I will definitely be on the look out for any of his other movies.",1156118400,8,1065,4.546875

2604242,5,B000GB5M92,"I just watched this film recently and must admit that I feel that it is in fact a truly fantastic horror film.
I liked it, but it could have been a bit longer and had a bit longer ending.
It's not based on I Spit On Your Grave, but a serial killer case.
Or rather, spree.
Plot; a group of serial killers on the lose in the Australian landscape decide to attack, abduct and torture what two victims but end up confronting parents who are far smarter than they thought they were with potentially catastrophic consequences for their plan.
The group is led by a strong, heavily muscular built gentleman who goes by the name 'chaos', then the terror begins, and reigns supreme throughout the rest of the whole film.
I've watched lots of horror films, many of them really good, some better than Chaos, others worse.....
Chaos is set to become an instanat smash hit and a cult film in the near future since the beginning of it's conception.......
It does not remind me much of I Spit On Your Grave.....
I have not yet seen the original I Spit On Your Grave, I saw it's remake and intend to see the original......",1310169600,2,1105,4.421568627450981

I'm sure you already know this but I just thought I emphasize it to anyone who is thinking of buying this movie.  I'll admit, I love gore and that's why I decided to buy this movie but this movie only had two ""gore"" scenes that we poorly scripted and as well as acted.  In fact, the whole movie had corny dialogue, ammeter actors, and on top of that a stupid ending.  I like movies with a cliffhanger or even bad endings but movies that just cut you off with no hope of anything good or bad (like this movie had) is what grinds my gears.  I absolutely regret purchasing this movie and wish I could get my money back.  I actually wound up throwing it in the trash.

All you see is upper body shots and suppose to guess what is happening off screen. The character ""Chaos"" is suppose to be the face of evil and is portrayed as just a horny redneck.  The performaces by the actors were lousy and not beliveable at all.  The movie obviously tried to build a name by creating controversy when maybe they should directed their efforst to the movie instead of hyping it.

Yes, in the last 20 minutes or so of the film it does become a carbon copy of the original Last House on the Left BUT the filmmakers do throw in a twist ending. The film over all was brutal but not as brutal or well executed as [...]. Both far superior revenge films. The opening ""message"" seemed kind of silly as if the filmmakers were trying to justify the brutality they were about to subject you too. The torture did make me squirm at times but again, Hood Has Eyez knocks this out the box. Recommended for those who like rape/revenge films.",1257465600,,781,4.468531468531468
2604246,1,B000GB5M92,"This movie is exactly like Last House On The Left. So much so that as it moves along you would think that you were watching the Wes Craven classic. The only difference is that they changed some parts around. You know a quick revision but not enough to not recognize the movie they are stealing from.

The story is basically two naive girls on their way to a rave mistakenly walk into the clutches of the dumbest and most ugliest people ever captured on film. They are tortured and killed and the three idiots oops I meant criminals go to the house of one of their parents. Sounds familiar? It should.

The acting terribly unconvincing. I never once believed those girls were in danger but I do believe that they might have had a bad case of the runs. The villains were stupid and pathetic and this movie even has a campy subplot involving idiotic cops just like Last House On The Left!
Seriously, this movie is really bad and gives low budget cinema a bad name. There are some low budget movies out there that are good and are made with heart but this is not one of them. The director(David DeFalco) is this fiasco should be forced to watch his own rubbish till his eyes bleed. Honestly, Batman and Robin was scarier than this slop. Lets hope that this mangy dog doesnt inspire more hacks to be hacks because low budget cinema doesnt need anymore than it already has. Two thumbs down.",1241481600,10,1384,4.44488188976378
2604247,2,B000GB5M92,"This flick is supposed to be a *cautionary tale*. In this case, the cautionary tale is something like - don't get involved with dirty strangers cause they may cut off parts of your anatomy and force you to eat it. If it wasn't so low budget, it might have been OK for a gore flick. But when he supposedly cut off the nipple..you could see it was fake blood and that booby was bigger than the other one(hidden nipple and top of breast). What a snore!
I love horror movies and am not offended by violence, as a matter of fact, I love the Saw series, but this was garbage. And if DeFalco thought the ending was ""realistic"", then he's a bigger idiot than I thought.
This film has no character development no advancement and no real lesson to learn except the one they have to blatantly tell you at the beginning of the movie.

This flick belongs on television(basic cable) at 3 am",1224201600,,876,4.341463414634147

Most cannot withstand a film with such a disregard for anyone who takes a chance on viewing it.
This movie makes most feel like they have to prove their morals by slamming it.
I was fortunate enough to see this movie in my local theatre I have never seen people so  uncomfortable and quiet in their seats, I saw it twice and both nights people got up and left the theatre. Horror should not be cute or comforting, call me crazy but I feel that horror movies should be "" Horrifying ""!?!
I love this movie because I could feel people's skin crawling and it is not predictable or slow!!!
No needless dialogue to attempt to inject emotion or justify the unjustifyable.
If you think a movie can't make you uneasy and you want to test those waters then I would suggest this movie MAKE SURE YOU GET THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!!!!,
I would also suggest this movie for people that need something complain to about but I don't wanna hear it!
I too will be looking for more from David Defalco!

My version didn't have anything that was mentioned.  Where were all the shocking scenes like the torture, rape and violence ?  In that respect I feel really ripped off.  The cover of the movie says its the most brutal movie ever filmed.  Which movie was that because it wasn't the one in the case.  I think I got sent only half the movie but the run time was 74 minutes.  What happened to all the good scenes ?

2604251,1,B000GB5M92,"In actuality, I would give this no stars.  It really doesn't deserve a review, but I'm going to join the other 13 who have reviewed it and put in my two cents worth.

Opening with the biggest laugh of all is the credit that read:  ""Based on an Original Idea.""  Whose idea was it--Ingmar Bergman's or Wes Cravens--because this is so close to being ""Last House on the Left"" it isnt' funny.  And to make matters worse the movie opens with this ""message"" to young girls.  Funny how you can speak out of both sides of your mouth.  We're giving you a ""message movie,"" but we're still mysogonists.

Horribly directed, laughingly acted, with Grade Z special effects, this howler did not shock me, and I was only disturbed because of the blatant plagarism in the movie.  It's really difficult to call this a movie, because it's run time is only 74 minutes.  Guess those original ideas dried up rather quickly.  I could almost just hear DeFalco in the background saying OUTLOUD, ""Wasn't that shocking?  Now THAT was shocking.""  And why Roger Ebert ever decided to get involved in a war of words with the two numbskulls who wrote and directed this, is as difficult to decipher as the riddle of the Sphynx.

Avoid this one at all costs.",1200441600,2,1224,4.555045871559633

Andrew D. MacEwen: What the HELL are you blathering on about?  Quit circling the airport and bring the plane in for a landing (read: get to the point).  Better yet, why not actually give the rest of us your honest, critical opinion about the movie?  Since you took the time to so painstakingly lambaste the rest of us for our opinions, don't you think that yours should be fair game as well?  Or are you afraid to accept what you so liberally give out?

Original comments:
This is a sick, reprehensible film, made all the worse by the produer and director's claim that the film has some social ""message"".  Two girls who go to a rave in the woods in search of E meet up with a gang of thugs and get violated and brutally murdered. Thugs wind up in the house of one of the girls and bloodshed ensues.  Wes Craven should sue.  But the social ""message,"" as stated by the filmakers in the extras, is that the girls get into trouble when they leave the party.  That's it.  Fin.  This is their argument for lingering almost sociopathically on the extreme, brutal violence that befalls these girls.  This goes well beyond exploitation--of which the best films were always able to view the violence with an ironic wink and a sense of fun--and into unhealthy territory.  The movie is incredibly nasty and mean, hopeless and nihilistic.  Writer/Director David De Falco actually seems to take some pleasure in the atrocities he forces onto the viewer, and that, to me, is incredibly dangerous.  I think Ebert was spot-on with his now-famous question: ""What place does pure evil have in film?""  A movie to avoid at all costs.  I hope David De Falco is never again allowed behind a camera.",1174435200,7,1698,4.588039867109635
2604254,1,B000GB5M92,"Aside from the amateur acting and direction, the bleak, pointless ""plot,"" and the endless, cruel, sadistic, misogynist sexual violence, the most galling thing about CHAOS is director DeFalco's deluded and/or arrogant boast that his film is actually ""based on an original idea"" - when anyone watching the film with a casual knowledge of horror film history will instantly recognize CHAOS for what it really is: an inept remake-cum-rip-off of Wes Craven's classic, ground-breaking, and infinitely more disturbing LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, made over 30 years ago!  The only thing CHAOS has going for it is an intense, credible lead performance from Kevin Gage as the leader CHAOS himself - he's truly heartless, evil, and totally convincing, even if the performances by the young girls/victims aren't. Still, it's hard to watch, much less stomach, so much mind-numbing violence directed toward young innocent girls - in particular, there are two very graphic rape/torture/murder scenes that are so stomach-turning, cruel, and just plain mean-spirited that they, depressingly, almost push the envelope in terms of the limits of onscreen taste - almost. But since the film serves no purpose except to shock, nauseate, and give jaded viewers a sick voyeuristic thrill, do we really need to endure much more of this poorly-shot brand of vicious rape, necrophilia, and murder in such unblinking, exploitive, & sleazy fashion?  Does it turn the audience on or off, and does it even matter? Will this cynical horrorshow of sliced & stabbed genitals or endless sobbing/screaming/pleading female victims make CHAOS an underground cult hit because of it? Even if you reach the cop-out climax, it doesn't matter - there's still no reason to support it - esp given the disingenuous ""warning"" that wraps the whole film like a flimsy excuse.  Rent it on Netflix if you must, but don't BUY it to support his sexist trash.",1171929600,7,1901,5.165584415584416

As for this film, yes, it's a copy of a much better film but instead of railing against it, just ignore it. There are worse films out there and the more attention films like this and Hostel get, the more we'll see of them.

2604256,5,B000GB5M92,"Wow I can't believe how anyone who is a fan of horror movies can not like this. The character ""Chaos"" is one of the most believable villains and probably the sickest, most twisted, in film history. The ending might be the coolest one of any horror film EVER!

2604257,1,B000GB5M92,"By now everybody knows that ""Chaos"" is supposedly a violent, unrestrained film. It IS violent, and yet restrained, it's one of those films that promises a lot with it's hype and premise, and in this case delivers something FAR below expectations. You know your production is in trouble when the director is a guy who calls himself ""The Demon,"" in this case David ""The Demon"" DeFalco. Oh DeFalco has spent a lot of time and energy defending the piece as a look at ""real life"" and pure evil blah blah blah, claiming this is the most brutal movie ever made eventhough Mel Gibson's ""The Passion Of The Christ"" outdoes the film in pure blood and violence, DeFalco and his producer have also been waging a childish print and video debate with Roger Ebert who rightfully gave the movie zero stars. At the end of the day what brings ""Chaos"" down isn't the subject matter, but the mere fact that this is pretty poor filmmaking. First there's the look of the movie, it looks like a straight to video production with really simple, pale lighting that doesn't even make the movie look sinister. This really looks more like a first term student film by students still learning to use the equipment. The camera work consists of a few hand held shots and pretty basic framing, nothing too intense. The actors are also very unconvincing, they deliver either performances that come off as too cheesy or too overdone. The biggest problem here though is the script which is so poorly crafted. Characters are cardboard cut-outs with no personality, they merely exist for the purposes of running, grinning, screaming and looking tough or scared. The dialogue is laughable and the story advances with such a choppy, simple rhythm that we can't take any of it seriously. The violence itself only reaches a shocking climax in two scenes, this is not a non-stop orgy of death and killing, in fact, I found the movie to be quite restrained. Oh sure the nipple slicing scene is pretty grotesque, and the final murder in the woods is also birthed from a disturbing use of the imagination, but a more intense, graphic movie would be Meir Zarchi's ""I Spit On Your Grave"" which makes ""Chaos"" look like child's play, or Pasolini's ""Salo"" based on the Marquis De Sade's ""120 Days Of Sodom."" DeFalco also needs to be a little more original, movie buffs are already signaling out all the obvious ""Last House On The Left"" rip-offs present in the movie. I see the film more as one of those cheesy attempts by a guy who thinks he's tapped into reality at trying to make ""something real"" when in fact it doesn't feel real at all. Evil is a topic best looked at when it's done with a balanced blend of violence and psychology as in ""The Silence Of The Lambs,"" ""Seven,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and horror works best when it is attempted with a real sense of the disturbing and gritty as with the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" ""Chaos"" is more of a geek show, with scenes of pain, breasts and slobbering villains in a B-movie setting. This is not the most brutal movie ever made, or one of the best, or one worth checking out.",1160092800,24,3081,4.624087591240876
2604258,3,B000GB5M92,"First off I am a Horror movie buff, I have over 3,500 DVDs to my name most of them Horror. This movie clearly was a rip off of Last House on the Left and countless other movie's. I am not rating it on it's violence because I could care less about violence in movies because I know people are acting and it's not real, so fiction does not get to me in the way everybody is screaming about how this movie is harsh and evil. The worst thing to happen to horror movie's or movies in general is the MPAA because they chop movies up and they choose what we should see, which is one more thing of control. My problem's with this movie is, there was some major bad acting in spots. You could clearly tell the fake crying at spots. And yes these dumb bitch's go off with some guy they don't know into the middle of the woods and they don't expect nothing to happen. The shot with the father running in with the chainsaw, there was no pause he had to do what he had to do, and then moments later the most stupid thing happened, he hisatated on the man that was the ring leader Chaos, he just sliced with a chainsaw and now won't finish it, that to me was the biggest mistake, it should have been wrote diffrent he should have went through with it or he should not have had the gun. Every one is talking about this over violence in this movie, half of it was off screen, all you really saw was blood, screaming and the imagination of the mind in what they where doing. The ending was so far over the top that to me it reminded me of a corny 1970's movie. I don't really care if the bad guy win's or lose's what I do care about is the reality in movie's and a belivable outcome when you start something you should end with reality, the whole hisatation part the shoot out at the bar western style of an ending made no sense to me because the movie was strong in moments and then went the typical route of oh yeah that was coming.

The only disturbing thing about this film was David Defalco prancing around the coroner's office talking about how his film is so brutal. Another reviewer compared him to a WWF guy, and that reviewer was right on point.

The bottom line, if you are looking for a film to disturb you, DON'T go with this movie. Most of the time, you can't even tell what is going on due to the shaky camera and bad angles.",1159574400,6,628,4.233333333333333
2604260,2,B000GB5M92,"Original story based on the killings of Pee Wee Gaskins? (as described on the back of the DVD)  Nope.  More like an almost scene-by-scene remake of Last House on the Left and is very much inferior to its inspiration.

Most Brutal movie ever?  Not even close.  August Underground, Mordum, Man Bites Dog, Murder Set Pieces, I Spit on Your Grave...I can think of dozens more than are way more brutal than Chaos.  OK, slicing off a girl's nipple and force feeding it to her is pretty icky, but not when the effects are shoddy.  Yes, raping a corpse is nasty stuff, but it pales in comparison of the brutality and feeling of disgust and horror when presented with the same material in a movie like Cerda's Aftermath.  Even the original Last House had scenes that were more brutal and unsettling than Chaos, and they didn't have to slice off and cannibalize nipples to do it.

Acting is relatively substandard, save for the main bad guy who was played with gusto and noticeable enthusiasm.  Comparatively though, he's no David Hess.  The other bad guys were throwaways- just deranged junkies.  Wes established a lot more characterization and even humanity with the bad guys in LHOTL; we don't learn much about Chaos's baddies apart from, well....they're junkies, they commit atrocities, and once in a while one of them feels a momentary pang of guilt about what's happening, but never acts upon anything.

Extras wise, the disc has a few nice additions that wind up spoiled.  The Roger Ebert controversy turns into an essay of defending their film against Ebert's reports against Chaos.  Both sides make valid and invalid points, it's just not that engaging to watch.  And what could have been a great extra in a visit to the LA morgue becomes an exercise in the ludicrous as the director assumes a shirtless WWE wrestler persona while surrounded by real dead bodies.  I don't know if that's the director's real personality or whether he was attempting to make a comedic, ironic statement with the contrast and dark humor, but for me it went over like a house on fire.

It's not a pleasant movie by any stretch of the imagination, but neither was it engaging, entertaining or significantly brutal or disturbing like the original LHOTL, or countless other movies that have far better rights to the tagline of ""most brutal movie ever"".  With the hype and the advertising, it's a severe disappointment that is more Shakespeare than Craven when it comes to summing up Chaos: ""a tale told by an idiot....full of sound and fury...signifying nothing"".

There is absolutely NOTHING ORIGINAL about this movie at all...and I can deal with that because it's still a brutally entertaining film.  I thought it was a pretty good remake until I watched the director's interviews.  In the extras on the DVD, the director talks about himself as if he was some martyr being persecuted for making  a  movie that finally told the truth about the harsh world, when all he really did was RIP OFF a classic exploitation film from 30 YEARS AGO (and playin it  off as if we are to stupid to realize it!!!!).  Not once does he even mention Last House as an influence, or drop Wes Craven's name as inspiration!  Instead, he says that the film was inspired by some serial killer named Pee Wee somethin or other...what a hack!!!

It's one thing to remake or reinterpret a film, but don't play it off like  you're some kind of ""pioneer"" of the shock film industry...you're just insulting the intelligence of your audience!

The tagline shouldn't say ""The Most Brutal Film Ever Made""...it should say

8130241,1,B000GB5M92,"Thoroughly pointless Last House on the Left rip-off about two girls who are kidnapped, raped and murdered by some thugs when they make the mistake of trying to buy some ecstasy before a rave--in the notorious 1972 film the girls tried to buy grass before a rock concert.  Chaos keeps following the Last House on the Left template so closely Wes Craven deserved screen credit--not that he would have wanted it.

All writer/director David DeFalco manages to bring to the material is one nasty gore shot and a reworked ending that is unsatisfying and ludicrous.  Wes Craven's original 1972 film was seriously flawed but in its day it felt genuinely transgressive--even today it remains disturbing despite the tame by contemporary standards violence and nudity.  Chaos is plenty sadistic but never manages to be disturbing because of the blatantly second-hand nature of the material--it's just somebody with no imagination copying another artist's film virtually scene for scene with no apparent purpose.

Wes Craven was an English professor before making Last House on the Left and the inspiration was a highbrow Ingmar Bergman film called The Virgin Spring.  Craven's film-making skill didn't come close to matching his intelligence or ambition on Last House on the Left but he learned enough that his follow-up The Hills Have Eyes is an undisputed classic.  So basically writer/director David DeFalco is shamelessly ripping off a movie Wes Craven made before he knew what he was doing but without trying to improve or significantly change anything--I'm not sure that it's even possible to make a film more pointless and unnecessary than Chaos.  Some say imitation is the sincerest for of flattery but all David DeFalco's Chaos manages to do is make a young and inexperienced Wes Craven look like a genius.",1426291200,,1804,5.112244897959184
8130242,1,B000GB5M92,"I beg you please do not see this film. I have no idea how the filmmakers are not sued buyt basically they took the script of last house on the left and remade it exactly, except its not nearly as brutal and the killers are not as menacing as the original. How are they not sued. I swear its exactly the same thing except they are going to a rave and want e instead of wanting pot for a rock concert. THAT IS IT! Its poorly directed the line up of the scenes make no sense its as if they droped the script the pages were all out of order and they just said go with it. This is horrible early in my top 5 worst films ever. And i really was looking forward to this so i am pissed. I want my money back.",1425340800,,699,3.8275862068965516

8130244,2,B000GB5M92,"Not as hardcore or as grindhouse as the reviews. If you've seen Last House on the Left, (original or even better remake), or I Spit on Your Grave (original or remake), Thriller: A Cruel Picture, Lipstick, Ms. 45, or countless others in this mold, then you don't need to see this. Buy Run! Bitch Run! instead. That is a much better homage to the 70's grindhouse classics.",1408492800,,370,4.537313432835821
