6750265,5,B00OGTZLGY,"I bought my first Phantom quad copter (Vision 2 +) a while back and needless to say it's a brilliant product but the learning curve is very steep.  What James Bendewald has done with this Blue-ray  series is a God send!  He very clearly and concisely explains your Phantom's set up, functions (some hidden) and controls in a logical, easy to understand flow. Information that that took me days of searching the internet to find (with lots of dead ends) is all contained here. A must buy!",1415923200,4,487,4.574712643678161

I'm glad I purchased the program (mine was the phantom 3 standard online). Worth the price if you want to be well educated going into this hobby. If you don't do your homework you risk crashing your expensive ""toy""!",1479772800,,354,4.378787878787879

Mr. Bendewald has done a remarkable job in his explanation of the core features and workings of this unit!  He has a knack for explaining things where dummies like myself can easily grasp the ideas presented and I really appreciate it!  I cant tell you how much easier this makes it to set up your new copter!  The best thing is the peace of mind that it gives you when you actually go to fly the dang thing!",1422316800,2,521,4.275510204081633

I was confused about the functions of the S1 and S2 switches.  The videos clarify how they are used.

8683518,5,B00OGTZLGY,"The Phantom has made it so easy for anyone to power up and just fly and get great footage on that first flight.  Problem is most people just keep flying with the basics that Phantom makes so easy.  They don't spend the time to dig into the details and learn about the software, the different functions and features that will make them a better pilot and a safer pilot. I'm an RC enthusiast and also a pro videographer and I know first hand the amazing work that can be done with the Phantom.  The information Jim shares in these videos takes you to the next level to help you get the most out of your Phantom and not just the basics.",1416268800,3,633,4.214876033057851
