Spoilers ahead!

Chikamatsu Monogatari is the third film Mizoguchi Kenji made in 1954. Coming at a time when foreign countries were starting to grow tired of jidaigeki Japanese period dramas (Mizoguchis own The Life of Oharu [1952], Ugetsu Monogatari [1953] and Sansh Day [1954], Kurosawas Rashmon [1951] and Kinugasas The Gate of Hell [1953] had all picked up prizes at film festivals worldwide), the film failed to win a prize abroad. Domestically however, the film was greeted with rave reviews and showered with prizes. It was placed 5th on Kinema Junpos Best Ten for the year (Sansh Day was placed only 9th) and picked up a geijutsu sensho (art recognition) award from the Ministry of Education, a silver prize at the Tky Citizens Film Concours and a blue ribbon from the Tky Film Reporters Club. It remains highly regarded in Japan as one of Mizoguchis greatest works, a view which clashes strongly with the views of certain foreign critics including that of Tony Rayns who finds the tone of the film overwhelmingly pedantic and Mizoguchis engagement with his material less than impassioned. To be fair, he has screenwriter Yoda Yoshikatas memoirs to back up his opinions. Mizoguchi threw out Kawaguchi Matsutars first treatment for being overly academic in keeping too close to the original source jruri (later bunraku) puppet play Daikyji Mukashi-Goyomi (The Almanac Maker) by Chikamatsu Monzaemon. His interest was piqued only after Yoda followed his instructions to take on board Ihara Saikakus treatment of the same story titled What the Seasons Brought the Almanac Maker. Even then Mizoguchi was not happy during the shoot. Rayns speculates he was still moping after his bust-up with Tanaka Kinuyo and Yoda himself relates the on-set tension between the director and his leading man Hasegawa Kazuo who refused to kowtow to the martinet directors strict regimen and in any case was 20 years too old for the part. Ironically, despite Mizoguchis merging of two sources and additions of his own which further altered the story, the film was praised for its authenticity and its dissemination of truly traditional Japanese culture.

My own verdict is that it is undoubtedly a 5-star recommendation. Superbly made, brilliantly acted and acutely structured, it is one of Mizoguchis finest films, but it is not one I feel impelled to return to quite as much as Ugetsu Monogatari or Sansh Day. The retention of the feeling of the stage puts it close to The Story of the Late Chysanthemums (1939), but where the melodrama of that film gushes memorably, the melodrama here is calculated and beautifully restrained until the halfway point where it is permitted release. We are moved, but the whiff of academia hovers over the film throughout. This is less didacticism than a loving reverence of the jruri form and no doubt it was this that many cultured Japanese critics appreciated the most. The Story of the Late Chysanthemums is informed by theatrical conventions of the more overtly melodramatic kabuki and shinpa forms and so the gushing melodrama is contextualized. The same could be said of Chikamatsu Monogatari with the conventions of jruri demanding a more distanced aesthetic approach which works for those inside the culture, but perhaps remains opaque for those outside it.

One of the consequences of careful fidelity to source is that compared with Ugetsu Monogatari and Sansh Day this film lacks thematic complexity. There is none of the humanist moralizing, the Buddhist meditation on the transitory nature of the human condition termed muj, the debate on the artistic process, the use of supernatural spiritual elements, or the sophisticated use of recurring visual motifs like fire and water that mark out those films. There is however, a fairly systematic statement of some of the key themes that demarcate the Mizoguchian worldview. The film is a sustained attack on patriarchy with the character of Ishun the Master Scrollmaker assuming a more central role than Mizoguchis usual patriarchs. The wonderful Shind Eitar is allowed to dominate the film in a way that even his Sansh Day does not. The seeds for his destruction lie in his own tyrannical over-bearing methods which force everyone around him to scheme and cheat to get by. Closely associated with patriarchy is the theme of women sacrificing themselves for men. In this film the maid Otama sacrifices herself by taking on the blame for a crime committed by the clerk Mohei. The falling woman is central to Mizoguchis films and is as present here as it is in his most famous film on the subject, The Life of Oharu with Ishuns wife Osan rebelling against patriarchy by absconding. Interesting for a Mizoguchi film, gender roles are turned around somewhat. Here it is the man who sacrifices himself for the woman. The notion of professional duty, of personal sacrifice to ones employer, gets truly noble expression through the character of Mohei who suppresses his love for Osan until the last possible moment when he thinks they are about to die. He stands out in a Mizoguchi uvre full of weak, vacillating self-obsessed men for his strong character and resolution. His moral purity and noble love leads to a happy outcome  the downfall of a patriarch and the consummation of an echt-Wagnerian liebestod (love-death). As per usual with Mizoguchi this films success rests on a superbly-balanced narrative structure subtly modulated to place the moment the central lovers declare themselves to each other Mt. Fuji-like at its very apex. This inverted V-like structure is also central to The Story of the Late Chysanthemums, the other surviving Mizoguchi film which also pays fastidious attention to its theater source.

Chikamatsus original play was written in 1715 and is based on real events that happened in 1683 during the Tenna era of the Edo period when an adulterous wife and her lover were publically crucified according to the law of the time. The location is the Kansai region (Kyt, saka and the area in between) and Mizoguchi retains the plays original 3-act structure while adapting the plot freely. Acts 1 and 3 take place in Kyt in the glaring light of day where characters have to conform to their roles within patriarchy while Act 2 takes place on the run in the rapturous night as the central couple in the story find themselves away from all social constraints. This (probably unintentionally) precisely reflects the day-night-day 3-act structure of Richard Wagners opera Tristan und Isolde which is also centrally concerned with forbidden love and is crowned with the most sumptuous liebestod. The action of the film centers on the harsh daylight of almanac maker Ishun who runs a successful business in Kyt designing and printing calendars for the Imperial household. Act 1 is set entirely in his house cum workshop and the tragic events happen as direct consequence of the harsh, mean and selfish way he rules over both his wife Osan (Kagawa Kyko) and his workers from the overseer Sukeyemon (Ozawa Sakae) through his chief designer Mohei (Hasegawa Kazuo) down to the household maid Otama (Minamida Yko) on whom he has unwelcomed lascivious designs. Osan is placed under pressure from her mother Oko (Naniwa Chieko) and wastrel brother Doki (Tanaka Haruo) who press her to ask Ishun for money to pay off debts. The miserly Ishun makes clear he loans money to nobody, not even direct relatives and Osan is forced to ask Mohei. The action turns on undeclared love. Otama secretly loves Mohei who in turn unknowingly loves Osan. When Ishun discovers Mohei has forged a money order to give to Osan, Otama throws herself on the floor saying the money is for her up-coming marriage to Mohei. Ishun wrongly thinks Otama and Mohei are an item and his jealousy leads him to have Mohei locked up. Osan finds out from Otama that her respectable husband is actively trying to bed the maid. They agree a scheme which will shame Ishun into acknowledging his adulterous designs and into being lenient to both Mohei and to Osan on the money she needs. They agree to swap beds for the night, Ishun expected to visit Otamas bedroom rather than his wifes.

At this point Mizoguchi/Yoda make the boldest and most successful diversion from the Chikamatsu original. In the play Mohei is not locked up. He visits Otamas bedroom and makes love to the lady all night long not knowing that Otama is actually Osan. Osan doesnt realize it is Mohei, thinking instead that this is her husband Ishun. The next morning Ishun discovers Mohei and Osan who are astonished to find themselves in bed together, adulterers by mistake. In the film Mohei escapes to Otamas room to thank her for interceding earlier, but is surprised to find Osan. They are in turn surprised by Sukeyemon as Mohei runs off into the night. Ishun now assumes his wife is carrying on with Mohei. He thrusts a dagger at Osan ordering her to kill herself. Her husband distracted, Osan also escapes the house. She meets Mohei by chance in the street and they escape Kyt together running off into the night. Importantly, though they are thought to be runaway adulterers, they are actually nothing of the kind. This has the effect of delaying the climax of the drama to Act 2, roughly halfway through the film after they have fled to saka to get the funds Osans family needs, when on the nocturnal waters of Lake Biwa they prepare to commit shinju (double suicide). Finally, Mohei declares his love and Osan after a moments hesitation admits to her love as well, the result being that she now wants to live rather than die. She flings herself into the startled Moheis arms. Its the pivotal scene of the whole film and a truly ecstatic moment. Note their intention now to live can only happen at night when they are free of patriarchal social rules. By the harsh light of day they can only be the walking dead as society demands they be crucified for their actions. The rest of Act 2 charts their journey to Moheis fathers (Sugai Ichir) farm where they spend a single blissful night before the authorities catch up with them. They are separated on Ishuns orders for he cant risk losing the respectability of his business if Osan is caught with Mohei and then crucified. Act 3 takes us back to Kyt where Osan is being forced by her family into returning to Ishun. Mohei meanwhile has been released by his father and he comes back for her. They are captured by the authorities together and are crucified in the bright daylight, but not before Ishuns business collapses and he is exiled for trying to hide the adultery. As the doomed couple ride a donkey back-to-back and hand-in-hand they smile, rejoicing they can end their lives together in a blissful liebestod which will see their spirits united on the other side.

As Mark Le Fanu points out in his booklet note, the film is remarkable for positing in the character of Mohei personal service or personal allegiance as only the sublimation of a profound romantic longing. This together with the fact that the theme of a male sacrificing himself for a woman is so rare in Mizoguchi makes the film fascinating. In Act 1 Mohei is totally unaware that he loves Osan. He respects her, looks up to her and serves her the best he can, but playing his role as the dutiful clerk in the family business he is unaware of any erotic longings. He senses Osan is in trouble and offers to help. She at first declines, but when she runs out of options she is forced to approach him for the money to give to her family. Mohei is willing to do anything for his mistress and so mis-uses the masters seal to get a money order. Mohei is surprised when Otama takes the blame off Osan and on escaping he drops in on Otama to thank her not knowing Osan is there. He wants to leave the company without incriminating Osan, but when they are caught together by Sukeyemon he sees the problem this will cause for her. At the start of Act 2 his thoughts are only for her and he continually advises her to return as they make the way through the night. His thoughts are merely to serve Osan the best way he can. When they are almost caught in saka, they see nothing for it but to kill themselves on Lake Biwa. Here Mohei is sacrificing himself for Osan (she explicitly says so), paying the ultimate price of loyal service. The rigid class barriers make romantic love unthinkable for him. The lake scene is beautifully done. Mohei ties Osan to himself so that they will drown quicker and at this moment of death, Mohei finally can free himself from what he has been sublimating. He loves Osan and he says so though for him this love is hardly romantic. He loves as a devoted employee might love his mistress. Osans shocked reaction quickly leads to her throwing herself into his arms (her love is unquestionably romantic!), but Moheis reaction is one of petrified fright, not rapture. His arms remain spread wide, his body paralyzed with shock as she gives her heart to him and the boat drifts off. According to the rigid parameters of the class system he can only state his love if they are going to die. Now they are going to live, this statement flies in the face of his understanding of the way the world is organized. In his mind while they are alive he is still Osans servant and when he later finds out from posters that authorities are only looking for him he deduces that Ishun still would accept Osan back to keep his business respectable. Mohei accepts his inevitable death, but tries to save Osans life by running away from her on a mountain while she is resting with a sprained ankle. Still, he insists on sacrificing himself so that his mistress may live. This mountain scene is equally as tumultuous as the lake scene as Osan chases Mohei down the path (an audacious crane shot from Miyagawa Kazuo picking her out from the foliage) until she cant run any longer and Mohei leaps out from the undergrowth to help her. She vents her anger asking him why he is running away. He tells her and she makes it clear that in her mind he is her partner not her servant. They throw themselves into each others arms and onto the ground in a ferocious embrace emitting an animal passion rare in Mizoguchi. At last, here Mohei starts to live by loving his mistress rather than serving her and this gives their night in the shack behind his fathers home a beguiling tender poignancy. The acting of both Hasegawa and Kagawa in both scenes is truly wonderful and in truth the film comes alive here in the manner of Mizoguchi at his very finest.

Underlining the dominant theme of a man sacrificing himself for a woman still further is the way the opposite theme (the Mizoguchi norm) is tempered to support it. The woman sacrificing herself for her man is obviously there in Otamas actions and in the original Chikamatsu play her rnin samurai uncle Akamatsu Bairy (played in the film by Azuma Rynosuke) has a large part. He actually punishes Otama for aiding Mohei and Osans adultery by beheading her. He takes the head to the place where the lovers are being confined and tries to convince the authorities into releasing them saying his niece was at fault! An act of stupidity, he has killed the only witness who could possibly save the lovers and they are crucified anyway. Mizoguchi deletes all of this, Bairys role reduced to one scene as he picks Otama up from the workshop to take her home. He prefers to stress Moheis sacrifice for Osan and depict the falling woman through the odyssey of Osan who loses everything in the physical world of a crushing patriarchy in the form of Ishun, but who gains everything in the spiritual world by embracing an altogether nobler (and ennobling) kind of love in the form of Mohei.

As in Wagners Tristan und Isolde, the (largely nocturnal) central Act is undoubtedly the most dynamic part of the film. The walk across the darkened countryside, the inn scene, the lake scene, the mountain scene, and the night in the shack all convey a passion which is difficult to resist. Also like the Wagner, the outer acts are pretty dazzling in the glaring light of day in their depiction of a patriarchy. In a way that is reminiscent of both Gion no Shimai (1936) and Gion Bayashi (1953) we see a whole society in motion with x-ray clarity. Shinds Ishun is a memorable creation, sycophantic to his customers, lascivious to his objects of desire (the poor Otama), dictatorial to his company staff who are painted as slaves working for a pittance, and overbearing to his wife Osan. Naked greed and gluttony breed the same qualities in those around it and Ozawa Sakae is brilliant as his crooked overseer Sukeyemon who is looking to back-stab his master by joining up with Ishuns main rival Isan (Ishiguro Tatsuya, also excellent). Isan is outwardly friendly to Ishun, but as the net closes around him his polite concern barely masks his delight at being offered the chance to leap into the position of Master Scrollmaker. Also observed with acidic realism is the behavior of the members of the court who start the film in debt to Ishun (who is a money lender after all, but not to his family!) and who finish the film delightedly having their debts recalled as Ishun is ruined. Mizoguchi makes plain that Ishun may be a monstrous patriarch, but he is simply a part of the bigger patriarchal machine that is society. He is no better, no worse than all the other male characters we see around him aside from Mohei, the exception proving the rule.

Visually Chikamatsu Monogatari is not as resplendent as Sansh Day and the interiors are shot with a simple low key style reminiscent of the previous Uwasa no Onna (Miyagawa Kazuo shot all three). As per usual with Mizoguchi, the camera is usually high looking down on his characters trapping them into corners of rooms while the lines in the tatami mats and sliding screens shoot off in directions outwards to convey life going on around the frame as well as inside it. Only when the lovers take flight does the films visual splendor really shine. The lake scene may lack the ghostly supernatural aura of the one in Ugetsu Monogatari, but the melodrama is conveyed splendidly courtesy of a long crane shot which allows the two superb actors to give everything. The boat drifting after Osan has thrown herself into Moheis arms is a beautiful visualization of the emotions of both  Osan being carried away by her love and Mohei drifting helplessly in startled shock. The mountain sequence is also exquisite. Its as if this film takes flight with the camera fixed to Mizoguchis beloved crane which roams nature in search of an adequate visual language to convey the emotions on display.

Finally, I want to point out Hayasaka Fumios extraordinary music in being an important element of Mizoguchis total conception. I have pointed out the high degree of fidelity to source in the film as making it a kind of companion film with The Story of the Late Chrysanthemums. As with that film, Mizoguchi chooses to deploy authentic theater music. In Chrysanthemums this was the music of kabuki. Here it is the music of bunraku and throughout the action is accompanied by a mixture of shamisen, flute and the assorted clicks and pops of various percussion instruments. This music is hardly tuneful in the Western sense and no doubt many will be alienated by it, but it offsets the flowing melodrama to great effect. Hayasaka was an incredibly versatile composer. In gendaigeki works such as The Lady of Musashino (1951) he provides incredibly lush Western soundtracks which sweep everything before it, but in the jidaigeki works authentic traditional Japanese music is preferred and the results are usually staggering as they are here. I have seen bunraku plays here in Japan several times and I can verify that watching this film gives the eerie feeling of actually watching a performance, only we are taken out of the theater and into the cosmos where nature and free love tangle deliciously. Strongly recommended, perhaps I am drawn to this film more than I had thought",1488240000,,20133,4.796888504753674
