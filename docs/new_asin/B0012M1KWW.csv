8246844,2,B0012M1KWW,"I had hopes that this would be a documentary minus all the twaddle of PBS leftist but no such luck.
The usual pontificating leftist professors brought up ""SOCIAL JUSTICE"" code word for communism.
(SEE Yuri Bezmenov former KGB agent video on Google video and you tube.)The vocabulary of Saul  Alanski is used repetitiously as they try to link the political left to His cause.

There is the usual leftist rant about other political activists such as Desmond Tutu a known communist and others who are affiliated with the communist agenda. They bring up as examples of those men who later followed Wilberforce's example.

They try to portray Wilberforce as a follower of Humanism and not a Good Christian.
His Christianity gets in the way of some of the Professors that are the talking heads on this video.

The fact William Wilberforce is on a calling from God is degraded with the phase
"" In spite of being a Christian Wilberforce did the work of a political activist.""

PBS needs to be defunded.",1310601600,7,994,4.755813953488372
8246845,4,B0012M1KWW,"I had wanted to see this DVD for several years and a friend finally lent it to me.  If you don't know anything about William Wilberforce, this is an excellent resource to start with.  The documentary is only 1 hour long, but it uses that time well.  They rely heavily on several Wilbeforce biographers, Kevin Belmonte, Eric Metaxas, and John Pollock, who know their subject very well.  The narration is outstanding!  I did not know ahead of time that Avery Brooks (best known as Benjamin Sisko on Start Trek:  Deep Space Nine, but has also been a professor at Rutgers) was the narrator, but his deep commanding voice adds just the right level of gravitas to the story that is being told.  Even though I have read many books on Wilberforce and the way God used him to change England and the world, it still left me inspired and encouraged.  The only minor quibble is that they were a little 'generic' about his faith in Christ, but they did get the story right about his journey to his conversion and how it impacted him.  All in all, highly recommended, and as one other reviewer mentioned, it probably is a better starting place to learn about this man than the Amazing Grace movie (although that is a fairly good production as well - even if the star of the movie is way too tall and robust to truly embody William Wilberforce).  Pick up The Better Hour if you can, or see if PBS happens to show it again in your area.  You won't regret it!",1295308800,4,1442,4.424242424242424
8246846,5,B0012M1KWW,I am from the city of Hull in England that was represented in Parliament by Wilberforce. This covers his legacy pretty well.,1234915200,4,124,4.681818181818182
8246847,5,B0012M1KWW,"I think this documentary is much more satisfying than the movie ""Amazing Grace"", since it presents a much richer and more nuanced perspective on Wilberforce's life and the monumental consequences of his lifelong commitments.",1228262400,6,224,5.617647058823529
8246848,5,B0012M1KWW,"""Let no man forget the name of William Wilberforce"" said Frederick Douglas. Yet that is exactly what has happened. William Wilberforce, a man who, through his extraordinary persistence, clarity of communication, and use of innovative techniques that are still used today, changed the world.

This documentary makes a huge contribution to the modern awareness of William Wilberforce. By bringing together a far-flung and broad range of scholars, from multiple disciplines, we get a clear picture the work done by Wilberforce and his associates. A work that at once astounds (that such atrocities occurred) and stuns (that they are still going on today).

I had the privilege of seeing two preview screenings of this documentary: One with my family, then in a large gathering.

In both cases the documentary elicited vigorous discussion. With my family it gave us an opportunity to discuss the values associated with the efforts and the ongoing struggles today to end human trafficking. In the group setting attendees gathered into small groups after seeing the film and had similar discussions and dialogue. In both cases viewers were motivated to find at least wrong in their community they could help right.

Should you purchase this film? Yes, absolutely, yes. Then show it to as many people as you can. Visit the companion website ""The Better Hour Gatherings"" website for some suggestions on group activities you can do with this documentary.

Check out the companion book, ""CREATING THE BETTER HOUR: Lessons from William Wilberforce,"" for an extended discussion of Wilberforce's work and its ongoing influence.

It is my hope that this film and book ""use the examples of Wilberforce and his Clapham Circle to ignite a new generation of social activism!"" PUBLISHERS WEEKLY, Jan. 2, 2008

If we can nationally spend more than $54,000,000 in one week watching the  'Best of Both Worlds Concert' we can find a way to change the world.",1203033600,7,2167,5.643076923076923
