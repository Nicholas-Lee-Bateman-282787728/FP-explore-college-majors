8393591,1,B003BHE032,When it arrived watch it. The subtitles were off so movie didn't make any sense. Had it for over 4 years now and never watched it becausenof the subtitles.,1416700800,,155,4.379310344827586
8393592,1,B003BHE032,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!! The subtitles are absolutely horrible. Do yourself a favor and download the fan-sub from online. Whoever did the subtitles for this obviously translated them through Google, because they make little to no sense. Plus the burn quality is rather poor, the disc kept skipping and jumping around and it was the first time I played it.",1312329600,2,354,4.819672131147541
8393593,2,B003BHE032,"I am one of the biggest Takashi Miike(director) fans, so it pains me to review this film with lackluster support. If you are aware of most subject matter that Miike uses in his films then you will be disappointed in finding out this is the most mundane and dry teenage gangster film you will ever see. I recommend Fudoh: The New Generation, ...insane. This 2 film collection is not worth Takashi Miike time or effort, really a disappoinment. If you are intent on seeing this film anyway I won't spoil the film, but you should know the English subtitles suck ass in the first Crow Zero film. I thought I was reading English from a Japanese gangster who dropped out of school in the second grade. The second films subtitles were spot on. All and all the best part of the film was that Amazon.com got me this film in no time flat with free shipping, spent over $25.00 on total shipment though. Miike still rules- Audition-Ichi the Killer-Dead or Alive series.",1311206400,,956,4.563953488372093
8393594,3,B003BHE032,"I would like to thank the seller, because the product was sent just fine to my house.

The problem is the subtitle. It is just TOO FAST we set in english (i'm brazillian and i'm used to see subtitled movies). Sometimes it stays on the screen for 1 second!! Very very fast....

and some of the things people are saying is wrongly translated....

except that, everything is fine! =D

Thanks again!",1307491200,,395,4.52112676056338
8393595,2,B003BHE032,The first dvd must be a bad burn because it just runs choppy and eventually the DVD player gave up on it. Havent tried the second disk yet.,1304985600,,139,4.0
8393596,5,B003BHE032,"Its true. The subtitles on the first movie leave something to be desired. You still know what's going on, but the choice of words and grammar aren't good. Subtitles on the second one are fine. I really enjoyed both films, even with the less than perfect subtitles on the first film. I'd ordinarily give this set 3.5 or 4 stars because the movies were really good, and except for the subtitles on the first movie, this is an excellent 2-DVD set. Packaging was excellent and it even came with a glossy slipcase. Price wise, this is a bargain. Some people gave this 2 stars, which I think is unfair considering its only $12 or $13 for both movies, so I'm giving this 5 stars to balance things out a bit.",1296086400,,700,4.392307692307693
8393597,2,B003BHE032,"I've seen the first Crows Zero before with English subtitles and I really, really enjoyed it. That copy was in a single set release that I rented from blockbuster. My problem with this specific product is that the subtitles are pretty bad. Bad enough that I can't enjoy the movie. Some of the dialog you can still figure out although it's backwards. And you will get the gist of conversations and what's happening but it really takes away from the movie. Most of the translations are laughable..
I'm sad to say this because it's a good movie, a double set, and a low price but I regret buying this product.",1288051200,,606,4.5181818181818185
8393598,5,B003BHE032,"I watched the movie and enjoyed it. I love the actor, Oguri Shun, reason why I bought it. I recieved this item quicker than the dates that were shown by Amazon which was awesome. I appreciate everything, thank you so much.",1286582400,,222,4.439024390243903
8393599,5,B003BHE032,Great movie.  Watched it before and enjoy the fact that I can watch it anytime now.  Subtitles kinda off but still a great experience all together.,1282348800,,147,4.615384615384615
