7798957,1,1577132866,I can not view the tape because the shell appears to be melted in some way that my JVC vcr won't even accept. I can't use it at all!,1415404800,,132,3.586206896551724
7798958,5,1577132866,"I'm pretty toned but this workout leaves my muscles deeply stretched and relaxed.  Toning the arms and legs is a nice ""side effect"" of the mostly ab-focused exercises--in order to hold these poses, the arms and legs do a lot of supporting and stretching. Only a few repetitions of each move (even the pretty simple ones) are needed if done slowly and with correct form.  The focus on breathing leaves me relaxed by the end. Jennifer Kries is a likeable instructor, too.",1141948800,,469,4.7073170731707314
7798959,5,1577132866,"This video is in 4 segments.  Each segment is 20 minutes long which is great when you are in a time crunch or to tack on to a cardio video.  This is a strength training video using you own body as resistance.  It has been  reviewed for its content so I won't go into that.
I am pretty  physically fit and this is a great workout.  The nice thing is that it  doesn't require any equipment except a bar (or a broom handle which I use).  This tape will really increase your flexibility as well.  I would be happy  to be half as flexible as the instructor.  The ab segment is one of the  toughest I have ever done.  It really works the lower abs which is a  woman's trouble zone.  You can get the lean lines of a dancer with this  tape, you won't add bulk which is why I like it.  I really recommend it.",964396800,13,799,3.9872611464968153
