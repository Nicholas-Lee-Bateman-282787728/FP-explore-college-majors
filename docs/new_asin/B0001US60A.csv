8016639,3,B0001US60A,"I had always heard what a great actor Gene Autry was so I bought this collection...but was disappointed at Autry's acting ability.  Yes, he definitely seemed like an authentic cowboy, but came across very stiff - especially in ""Boots & Saddles.""
The studios chose a good supporting cast to surround Autry, and they make the films entertaining and watchable.  However, it threw me when one of the cast mounted a horse from the wrong side - BIG mistake in a western.

The quality of this DVD was fine.  I didn't have any problems.

If you want to cool your heels and watch a western, these are entertaining enough for fans of westerns, or Autry fans.",1381708800,,648,4.6
8016640,5,B0001US60A,"The above reviewer needs to get a new hearing aid - there is no annoying hiss throughout EITHER FILM on this DVD.

Marengo Films spends a small fortune putting our films through the sound design process and for a reviewer to assert SOMETHING BOGUS is disheartening. We GUARANTEE THIS IS NOT TRUE.

Both of these prints are superb - the sound is as perfect as we can make it. There are two ""effects"" in THE FIGHTING WESTERNER which are in the actual sound track - the wind from a storm & sounds from a factory stamper.

We will refund TRIPLE YOUR COST if you find a hiss throughout a film on this DVD or ANY SOUND TRACK on any DVD Marengo Films puts out. Unlike some studios WE GUARANTEE OUR PRODUCT. These are the finest prints of these old Buckaroo's on the market - ENOUGH SAID except that we very much appreciate your business.",1167350400,5,830,4.376623376623376
8016641,4,B0001US60A,"FIGHTING WESTERNER-Randolph Scott investigates a murder at a radium mine.  This was initially a Paramount release based on a Zane Grey story.  It doesn't have that hurried feel of a B-movie(if this was) and the sets/locations are substantial.  Of note is the sound of the mine machinery.  The heavy clomp-clomp really is foreboding.  The images are pretty clear, but there is an annoying hiss throughout the movie.

Boots and Saddles-Gene Autry has to sell horses and win a race to save the ranch.  This was a Republic release.  I'm not a fan Autry, but this movie is fairly engaging.  You've got a couple of tunes, some comic relief and horses.  The image is clear and there is no hiss.

Both movies were made before 1940.",1102723200,3,723,4.704
