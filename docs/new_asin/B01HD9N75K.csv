7785574,3,B01HD9N75K,"This review is strictly for the packaging as a boxed set (Blu-ray), not the show itself or the AV quality.

The main product photo you see is a thin cardboard ""tuck"" box around a stack of the standard, individual season Blu-ray sets that you would otherwise buy separately. There is no unity tying the design of the individual seasons together, so should you choose to remove them from the box, they will not resemble a ""set"" sitting on the shelf with the different colors and formatting of their spines (pictured).

It's quite clear that each season inside was also pulled right off the retail shelf, as they each having the annoying stickers at the top holding the case closed, which sometimes peels off the silver Blu-ray logo embossing when removed, and they each contain an anti-theft alarm trigger. One of my seasons even had a corner of the original shrink wrap in place.

There are also annoying stickers on each season covering the original barcodes. These will not come off without leaving a messy residue unless you've got a lot of patience and some Goo Gone. One of my seasons (pictured) has multiple layers of stickers.

Since it's hard to tell from the photo, just know that the only thing that makes this a ""box set"" is the nice-looking from a distance, but cheap cardboard box around the outside. The ""texture"" you see is strictly visual.",1477180800,34,1354,4.72457627118644

7785608,1,B01HD9N75K,"Poorly acted and the stories prove ludicrous, long, and painful  as in ""please, get this over with already."" I felt nothing but repulsion for the characters. I made it to S5E2 on Prime, but will not waste another minute.

In S1, I was drawn to the rough-and-tough tone and Katey Sagal's character as matriarch. Then the show seemed desperate, trying too hard to fill the void that was Sopranos: modern-day mob morality matters and their family-always-comes-first hitches. However, Sopranos was more compelling and provocative and the actors were extraordinarily convincing, unlike those of SOA.

I read Scott Glenn was to play Clay and was replaced after the pilot. What were they thinking? SOA may have had a chance of being halfway decent with Glenn as a lead (removing the oafish Ron Perlman) and by giving Drea de Mateo more screen time (especially) with Sagal.

I think of Kim Coates's lackluster performance in S5E1 as his daughter is murdered in front of him. It was painful to watch not because of the subject matter. The scene was tepid, at best. I felt bad for Coates as an actor as it shouldve been an opportunity for him to shine, but fell short. I recently watched S6E19 of Sopranos with Gandolfinis intensity when Tonys daughter tells how a man from a rival family sexually harassed her, then his explosive release as he gets retribution. The same episode has a scene with Tony and his son, Gandolfinis acting makes me cry its so good. The juxtaposition and range is just remarkable.

I compare the two shows because I have read a lot that fans of SOA think its the best show ever. Theyre sadly mistaken and either don't give one ioda about acting and authenticity or theyve not made it beyond S2 of Sopranos. Case-in-point: Rolling Stones 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time poll of ""actors, writers, producers, critics, showrunners""  SOA isn't even on the list.

Also, what's with all the whispering on SOA? Whispering does NOT make the scene more dramatic! You have to turn the volume way up to hear the ANY dialog. Why are they whispering? Then you have to turn it down during the gun/motorcycle scenes. Really annoying when you want to watch at night and others in the home are in bed.",1523318400,,2202,4.71875

But, Im just a little disappointed in this particular box set because the product is advertised as having all seasons with translated to Spanish AUDIO and sadly only season one is dubbed to Spanish audio then all seasons after that you only get the English audio. That kinda pissed me off to be honest because I was looking forward to share and watch this show with my dad who only understands Spanish. Then another little thing the boxset isn't really a box set only all the seasons wrapped in a cheap, thin, fancy looking cardboard and honestly I wouldnt even be that mad at that small detail if all the seasons were like advertised dubbed to Spanish Audio not just subtitles.",1515628800,,715,4.550387596899225

7785633,3,B01HD9N75K,"The show itself overall is AWFUL. Sorry, didn't feel the way as all the people who bragged on the show did. Language, regular sex scenes your thing? Lots of bare behinds and simulated sex (no frontal nudity) to go around, so go for it. The plot is essentially leftover hippy motorcycle gang meets modern day gun running, drugs and prostitution. Lots of killing people, and as as it is loosely based on Hamlet, you know all of the major characters die. ALL. OF. THEM. I was okay with that. By the end of the series, I was cheering them on as they were offed. Good riddance. The last season is a murder fest. It's like an Oprah giveaway - YOU get a bullet, YOU, get a bullet! LOOK UNDER YOUR SEAT!! YOU get a bullet!!! There shouldn't be anyone left alive in any of the gangs in Charming, Stockton OR Oakland. Sheesh. Skip it and read Hamlet.

7785683,4,B01HD9N75K,"I think this is a great series but for one annoying thing, the background music. It was a loud as the dialog most of the time. This was as close to a musical as you can get without actually being one. I don't know who had the bright idea of pushing this band and their music but in my opinion it really took a loy of enjoyment out of watching the show.
I finally discovered closed caption and turned it on. They even had the words to the songs in the ""CC"" so you can tell when the music is blaring ( which is most of the time) and just hit the old mute button. I If there was no singing and just the loud stupid music going, they display the music symbols on screen. Thank you so much for closed captioning and the mute button.
Background music really enhances a film, this blaring overbearing crap on this series will ruin it for you if you let it.
The acting, stories, etc. were the best. I am looking forward to the next series about the Myans. I just hope the ""music man"" goes away!",1500163200,,986,4.087628865979381

I never seen this before, its used, looks like new at the firts look but some seasons inside has not the secure on top. And i got two cd with scratches, season 2 cd 3, and season 5 cd 3. It works good, but thats not what I pay for it. Season 1 its only on spanish audio.

Nunca me habia pasado esto, es un producto usado, parece nuevo a simple vista pero algunas temporadas no tenian la estampa de seguridad arriba. Y tengo dos discos rallados, temporada 2 cd 3, y temporada 5 cd 3. Trabajan bien, pero no es por lo que pague. La temporada 1 solo esta con audio en espa&ntilde;ol, la caja dice, pero en letras muy peque&ntilde;as...

The only let down was it seemed like when they got to the end of the movie, they just rushed through ending.  Like oops, we're out of time, end now.  But most TV series seem to be like that.

7785700,5,B01HD9N75K,"Hard to convince people that a show about outlaw bikers is a not only a good show but an amazingly great show, but it truly is.  The character development and story lines made for some of the best television drama I've ever seen.  For me it's right up there with Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones for quality of writing, acting and story narrative.  The show has been off the air now for close to 2 years I think and I still watch the show regularly.  It's just a great show.  Can't wait for Kurt Sutter to finish the spin off he's currently developing.",1490486400,,552,4.269230769230769
