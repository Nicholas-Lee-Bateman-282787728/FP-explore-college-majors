8633524,5,B00HMDD4QA,"Interested in getting more out of your bible studies?  Interested in learning a new language? Here is your opportunity!  This new dvd is the perfect answer for anyone wanting an easy introduction to the Greek language.

Although this is geared for high school students and older my younger kids enjoyed it.  Todd Friel has such a dry and quirky sense of humor that almost anyone would enjoy the program.  I have had experiences with other language Dvd curriculum and found the instructors to be boring or robot-like and my children did not want to study the curriculum.  This was not the case with this program.  We have not yet finished it - because we are doing lots of review and taking the course slowly.  However, I do not have to drag or beg my children to sit down and watch the lesson then do the work assigned.  Friel presents the language in an easy to understand and interesting way.  The children are excited to learn something new each time we sit down to watch.

I would recommend this not only for home school purposes but for anyone of any age who wants to enrich their bible study and their appreciation for the scriptures.  It is amazing how much richer scripture is when one has a basic understanding of the language and history of the time.  The Greek language is extremely deep in meaning.

I want to thank MasterBooks for allowing me to receive a copy of this curriculum for review in exchange for my honest review of the product.",1404172800,,1452,4.555984555984556
8633525,4,B00HMDD4QA,"I have always wanted to learn some Greek, so I was excited about getting this curriculum into my hands. I was not sure how my students would respond. At first they were a little taken aback by the thought of learning Greek but after watching the DVD and encountering the instructor Todd Friel, they were no longer hesitant to try it out. Todd Friel presents a simpler more usable way to learn Greek as an introduction to a deeper understanding of Greek. His first lessons motto Dont Memorize, Just Get It! turns a difficult introduction to Greek, into a simpler starter. He states you are not going to learn 1) how to translate or interpret 2) vocables or lists of vocabulary and 3) endings or rather several endings that are characteristic of the Greek language. The points he does emphasis as on the list of learning objectives are 1) how to read Greek 2) how to speak the (Koine-street) Greek language 3) how the language works 4) how to utilize a concordance 5) how to use a lexicon 6) improve your English 7) recognize English roots of Greek words 8) checking original scriptures/check false teaching 9) understanding commentary 10) understanding your pastor 11) understand the fullness of time and 12) learn to love Jesus more! Despite the first message shared Dont Memorize, Just Get It!  Lesson 2 is about memorizing the alphabet. Friel mentions this is the hardest thing you will have to memorize but it is totally necessary in order to read or speak the language. He also continues to use the comment, you must memorize that throughout which I found a bit funny. The information presented will definitely be useful as it helps understand our own language with more depth which is greatly needed in todays time. By Lesson 3 you can already be reading scripture in Greek.

  The parent lesson planner (PLP) includes a 90-day lesson planner and worksheets and practice sheets that are clearly labeled for scheduling and helps the student through the DVD as they fill in the blank while Friel teaches. The curriculum is definitely for the mature student as it is labeled for teens and adults that can follow along and understand his teaching as he assumes the Greek student knows all the grammatical terms. He does review some of the terms but not all. Todd Friel teaches at a fast pace with passion and humor. This is a great way to start learning Greek and decide if you want to go any further with it.

I have been given a copy of this curriculum by Master Books By New Leaf Publishing  in exchange of an honest review.

 My Review:

 Learning Greek has never been so much fun or so interesting as it is in this introductory DVD to the Greek language created by Todd Friel. With Todd's very optimistic and  down to earth nature, he takes you on a fun ride through the Greek language. His witty ways are sure to entice your child to really listen and learn all that he is eager to teach them. This is just an intro into the land of the Greek language, it is NOT an in depth study to get your children to start conversing in this language fluently. It is just a fun way to learn a little more about this sometimes difficult language.

 Your children will most definitely be drawn into learning more about Greek language because Todd has a great personality and he makes it look really easy. My children thought he was hilarious and yours will too! As a mom, I was excited because it was Biblically based and it would help us all to understand more when our Pastor uses any Greek references. The It's Not Greek DVD, contains 10 lessons, is geared for grades 10-12, and will count as a 1/2 credit language course, and is available here for $15.99. There is also a planner available, that will help you with the teaching aspect of this great curriculum, here is the link.

8633527,5,B00HMDD4QA,"I want to thank Master Books for providing me with a copy of Its Not Greek to Me in return for my honest review.

Trying to learn Greek along with your kids with a basic curriculum straight out of the box is a little like trying to drive from Portland to Yellowstone while just receiving verbal directions in 25-mile stints. Its a challenge, friends. And you are likely to feel really lost for, oh, the first six months or so. Maybe a year.

Who am I kidding? Youre lost for a long time. But

Youre going to be so excited! I found the Greek road map!

Its Not Greek to Me by Todd Friel (Master Books) is the overview your family needs to begin learning Koine Greek. In fact, if you're hoping to enable your children to read and understand Greek (rather than translate and interpret Greek), this may just be just the tool you need to allow your family to grasp the basics of the Greek language. Plus, Todd Friel is funny. My children watched the first three lessons with me and they're still laughing about them!

Heres what you're not going to learn from Its Not Greek to Me:

You will not learn
to translate or interpret Greek.
to memorize vocab.
declensions and cases for specific verbs and nouns.

Heres what Todd Friel promises you will learn:

You will learn
to read Greek  and youll be able to read the Greek New Testament.
how to speak the Greek language.
how Greek works.
how to use the Greek dictionary part of a concordance and a lexicon.
to improve your English grammar.
to recognize Greek roots in English words.
to check the original Greek Scriptures to discern true and false doctrine. (i.e. What were the authors actually saying?)
to get more out of Bible commentaries
to understand Greek references in sermons better.
to identify Gods sovereign hand in the timing of the history of the New Testament. (Koine Greek vs. Classical Greek)
to love Jesus better.

Those are some hefty promises, right?

What Mr. Friel does is give you an overview of the Greek language, teach you how the language is structured, and explain how to use the basic tools to navigate learning and studying using Greek. He teaches students how to learn Greek and gives them a decent base.

Honestly, I think its brilliant. Its a lot like teaching someone driving from Portland to Yellowstone how to read a map, teaching them to navigate, providing a compass and a map, then sending them on their merry way. If you want your kids to have a rudimentary understanding of Koine Greek, this is the place to get it. If you want them to study further, start here.

I say this three years into our (very slow) Greek journey. Were taking 6 months off our regularly-scheduled curriculum to use Its Not Greek to Me, and Im certain well walk away with a clearer understanding of what were studying.

I highly suggest that you purchase Master Books Intro to Biblical Greek Lesson Planner to go along with the DVD. At 132 pages, it includes a weekly lesson schedule, student worksheets, quizzes and tests, and an answer key.  By using the lesson planner (and Master Books lesson planners are very organized and well done), the Its Not Greek To Me DVD becomes a semester language course for 7th  12th grade, earning a 1/2 credit in language for high school. The lesson planner is consumable, so youll want one for each child.

Todd Friel also recommends purchasing an Interlinear Version of the Bible, such as this one: The New Greek-English Interlinear NT (Personal Size) This makes sense because it will be helpful to practice with.

In nearly every section, Mr. Friel walks through reading sections of Scripture and explains the importance of the Greek wording. I always want specifics on what well be learning in a language course, so in addition to Scripture in Koine and the practicle application of the Greek, heres whats covered in the ten lessons of Its Not Greek to Me:
1. The basics of what you will and won't learn in the course and a healthy dose of encouragement.
2. The alphabet, as well as regular and irregular diphthongs.
3. Punctuation, Greek marks for breathing and emphasis, the rules of syllabification.
4. A primer of English grammar.
5. Greek nouns and cases.
6. The nominative, genitive, and vocative cases.
7. The dative and accusative cases.
8. Verbs conjugations and prefixes.
9. Verb tenses.
10. How to apply new skills language skills to reading the Scriptures.

I highly recommend beginning your family journey in Greek with Its Not Greek to Me from Master Books.",1403049600,10,4520,4.683080808080808
