8202122,1,B000RPD0GY,"Don't buy this, you can just buy seasons 1 and 2 separately on Amazon for $12.99 each.

So $25.98 or over $50 for this set.  Hmmmm.",1227139200,11,131,4.0

You're not getting anything extra for buying this package, except but a higher price if you buy them individually... so what am I'm missing here and where's the advantage of buying this? Not a smart choice to do if you ask me...",1219968000,6,526,5.1647058823529415
8202124,5,B000RPD0GY,Love the show bought as a gift for my Brother.  Now he's hooked.  There were no problems with deliveries or product.,1216857600,,116,4.476190476190476
8202125,4,B000RPD0GY,"I really enjoyed these DVDs. As other reviewers have mentioned, the skits are hit and miss depending on your sense of humor. However, the skits are short so if one skit doesn't work for you it isn't long before another one. A lot of them are laugh out loud funny for me which is not easy for me to find. Be aware much of it is adult humor and not suitable for younger children. Skits include depictions of sex, gory deaths, swearing (mostly bleeped out but it is obvious they are saying 'F**K' or whatever).  It is definitely the 'Adult Swim' material it is made for but I really enjoyed it. For those who have not seen the show, it is all done with dolls and stop frame animation so even 'explicit' stuff is not that explicit. I just mean the subject matter is often adult in nature. Some of it is 'bust a gut' funny. I wish the episodes were longer and more of them.",1206662400,2,868,4.228915662650603
8202126,5,B000RPD0GY,It's hard enough sometimes to stay up until 11:30 on Sunday nights for this 10 minute show. Here you get everything all at once without commercials. A great compilation of some of the best off-color humor and animation ever!,1205712000,2,224,4.769230769230769
8202127,5,B000RPD0GY,"service from amazon is excellent.  I have no complaints.
