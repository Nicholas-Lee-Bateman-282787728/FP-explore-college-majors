8456178,5,B005452CXO,"A top notch kick butt concert from 1982.  And just so you keep rockin they add another concert from 2001.  This is a must have for any fan.  I prefer the 82 show.  But, The 01 show kicks butt too.  They just show they haven't lost anything after all those year's.  Do it!  Buy it!  Turn it up!  Rock on...",1520985600,,305,3.95

8456182,5,B005452CXO,"This 2 disc set is a must own for every true SMF.  The Northstage show from '82 is arguably the best DVD Twisted Sister has released and they've had a number of really good ones over the past few years.  I've always wanted to see the NY Steel show as well and that did not disappoint.  The band was stripped down to just jeans and t-shirts and hammered out a great set including a couple of old school songs from their club days.  If you're a true SMF and love the early TS stuff (and you aren't just hanging around to hear ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" and ""I Wanna Rock""), buy this DVD now!",1328918400,5,588,4.086956521739131
8456183,5,B005452CXO,"Dee and company got me into hard rock 27 years ago.  I love these guys!  The concert from 1982 is phenomenal!  I actually teared-up watching it.  It was so cool to be able to witness a TS show before they gained national notoriety.  I could almost feel the excitement and the anticipation of their impending launch to stardom.  I just wish I could have really been there in person back in the day.  Alas, I was too young and not yet aware of this wonderful band.  Over the years they have brought me much enjoyment.  This was like reliving all the good times over again!  I'm and SMF forever!  Play it Loud Mutha!",1326326400,,613,4.336283185840708
8456184,5,B005452CXO,"It was sometime in early 1980 when an East Coast friend turned me on to what was then the most popular bar band in the Tri-State area, Twisted Sister!

A few photos & a cassette of a radio broadcast from WLIR or WBAB assured me that I HAD to see this act.  So a buddy of mine & I flew cross country for a rock & roll vacation and  experienced 1st hand what became a legendary band.

Back then, seeing Twisted Sister live for the first time, was a right of passage. If you saw it, & you ""got it"", you were hooked for life.  30 years later, I'm still hooked & am glad to see this DVD shows them just as they were about to break out of their status as ""Kings of the club circuit"" & on their way to taking over MTV & the rock world at large.  Now if only they'd release some video from just a bit earlier, when I first saw them,  with  ""Fast Joey Brighton"" on drums, or even earlier, w/ Tony Petri on drums.

""SMF's"" everywhere will love this DVD.  Thanks for releasing it, boyz!

P.S.  R.I.P.  Joey Brighton .  =(",1326153600,,1010,4.010050251256281
8456185,5,B005452CXO,"Twisted sister is a band that was not really understood to the many who only new them for thier ""hits"".  However to the many S.M.F.s around the world, Twisted is a kick ass rock & roll maniac in a live setting.  Even their studio albums do not capture the band well.  This DVD is an excelent portrayal of the band in two completely different stages of its existence.",1314403200,6,366,4.352941176470588
8456186,5,B005452CXO,what can i say this brings me back to 80's when Twisted Sister where up on top both dvds Are awesome must for all TS fans,1314316800,,121,3.6923076923076925
8456187,4,B005452CXO,"Judge Bill Gibron, DVD Verdict-- Offering true Twisted Sister rarities, Double Live begins before the band were international superstars. Their 90 minute show at the North Stage Theater in Long Island would be considered by many to be their ""farewell""--from the club/bar scene, that is. The group was scheduled to head off to Europe shortly thereafter and record their first LP (1982's Under the Blade). Honed to perfection and sonically skin tight, this version of Sister was a true music machine, even if only the most devoted fan would recognize the set list. Absent are later mega-hits like ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" and ""I Wanna Rock."" In their place are cover versions of ""Leader of the Pack"" (always a weird selection for Snider and the boys) and the Rolling Stones ""It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (But I Like It)."" Along the way, we get terrific takes on ""What You Don't Know (Sure Can Hurt You),"" ""Bad Boys of Rock 'n' Roll,,"" ""Shoot 'em Down"" and ""You Can't Stop Rock 'n' Roll,"" among others. Aficionados will really enjoy rarities like ""Lady's Boy"" and ""Destroyer.""

As for the overall presentation here, the DVDs are quite good. North Stage is presented in a 1.33:1 full screen image that is clean, clear, if slightly muddled at times. Remember, this was recorded before video became a solid HD medium. We are getting an upgraded camcorder showcase, nothing more or less. Still, it looks great. So does the 1.79:1 anamorphic transfer offered for New York Steel. While the stage set-up is sparse (no large light show, no pyrotechnics) and the visuals less than flattering, the presentation element matches the music--lean, mean, and more than acceptable. As for the aural aspects, fans might be angry over a pure Dolby Digital Stereo only remaster. No multichannel choice of 5.1 immersion. At least the added content makes up for the lack of pure sonic bliss. We get interview documentaries accompanying each show, the band today discussing the particulars of each gig in an open and honest Behind the Music kind of confessional. There is also a stills gallery accompanying the New York Steel show, as well as DVD cover art essays from Trunk and French.

As a scrapbook of a band slowly reestablishing its classicism, Double Live is direct and delightful. Here is a chance to see Twisted Sister before they became a gaudy roadshow, and after they let fame fracture their brotherhood. A band as good as this deserves such a memento from their past. Luckily, their present seems destined for just as many accolades.
