703516,3,6303589154,"Charles Bronson passed away recently, and to remember him I decided to view once again one of his most bizarre films, ""The Evil That Men Do."" Returning to this film at least ten years after I last watched it was quite the trip down memory lane, back to the invigorating 1980s when low budget films like this played on cable every night. Some of the best B-movie action flicks in that era starred Bronson, who worked closely with companies like Cannon in order to bring us numerous sequels in his ""Death Wish"" franchise, the gruesome ""10 to Midnight,"" and the immensely unentertaining ""Assassination."" Of course, Bronson was much more than a string of cheesy actioners in the 1980s; he also appeared in some of the best known films of all time, like ""The Dirty Dozen,"" ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" and ""Chino."" Bronson's death at the age of eighty-one means we will never see a new Charles Bronson film, but at least we have plenty of great films to remember him by. I will miss him.
""The Evil That Men Do"" may not be one of Bronson's best roles, but it certainly ranks as one of his seediest. In this sleazy production, Bronson plays a retired assassin named Holland living out his days on the Cayman Islands. Life looks good until an old friend arrives on the island looking to lure Holland back into business again. This friend, Hector Lomelin (played by Jose Ferrer) brings with him a mountain of videotaped testimony in which an endless string of people relate personal accounts of the most repulsive tortures inflicted upon them and their families. One name repeatedly appears in these accounts: The Doctor, specifically Dr. Clement Molloch, a demented physician who dedicates his life to instructing petty despots in desolate Central American countries about the intricacies of mental and physical torture. In fact, the movie begins with a lengthy scene of the doctor's work, as he teaches a group of military officials in Surinam how to put out the lights on those pesky political opponents who always complain about such irritating things as elections, civil rights, and due process of law. Holland eventually agrees to exterminate the doctor in the name of human decency; he even refuses to accept a fee for hunting down this aberrant creature.
Holland heads to Central America to track down Molloch, but in order to allay any suspicions from the doctor and his gang of bodyguards, he brings along Rhiana Hildalgo (Theresa Saldana) and her daughter to pose as his wife and child. Hildalgo's husband died at the hands of Clement Molloch, so she ostensibly wants to see his memory avenged. Holland and his ""family"" meet up with Max Ortiz, a guy who hates despotic regimes and their reliance on Molloch as a political weapon. With Ortiz supplying the information on the doctor's whereabouts, Holland starts knocking off the hired help. He kills one of the bodyguards by flinging a knife into his throat, hangs another one with a fire hose, shotguns a couple of baddies, and kidnaps Molloch's seamy sister in order to lure the doctor into the line of fire. Along the way, Holland runs into problems with Paul Briggs, a U.S. embassy official who kowtows to Molloch and his goons. In a film loaded with atrocity piled on atrocity, the ending is nauseating to watch, as Molloch gets his comeuppance at the hands of a group of peasants who remember him only too well.
""The Evil That Men Do"" is one sick puppy of a movie. It's difficult to picture Bronson starring in such a tacky movie, but nearly all of Bronson's efforts in the 1980s depicted him as a vengeful entity mowing down the bad guys in increasingly sadistic ways. This film is no different, except that nearly every character (even the supposed good guys) leaves a bad taste in your mouth. To make matters worse, the script is so full of holes that you could sail a fleet of battleships through it. How could Molloch's bodyguard think Holland was anything but trouble after spotting him glaring at Molloch during that sporting event? And what was up with the weird recognition between Cannell and Holland in the village caf? Maybe I slipped into a coma while watching the movie, but I don't remember any background about these two characters knowing each other from some other place and time. I also never grasped the reasons why Holland decided to accept the mission after some initial reluctance. He watched several of Lomelin's tapes without batting an eye, and adamantly refuses to assassinate the doctor. Then suddenly he decides to lend a hand. Why? I don't know because it's never explained clearly. It's problems like these that handicap ""The Evil That Men Do.""
The DVD version does contain the uncut version of the film, or at least it appears so. The first segment is really a doozy, and it sets the tone for the monstrous activities to follow. Unfortunately, the only extras on the disc are three trailers: one for this film, one for ""The Replacement Killers,"" and one for ""The Big Hit."" At least the picture quality is quite good for such an old, low budget film. Maybe watching this slightly above average Bronson film isn't the best way to pay homage to the man, but it is a good representation of the movies Chuck churned out in the 1980s. After you work your way through the ""Death Wish"" films, you will need to see ""The Evil That Men Do"" in order to attain the rank of a Bronson completist.",1062720000,42,5373,4.729211087420043

In a sense you did, with the exception of...moments.
The one most memorable here: the good 'doctor'(Mengele wannabe) Chaz has been hunting gets his just desserts not via a bullet but through the crippled amputees he has experimented on over the years. Sort of reminded me of a zombie flick at that point.

703521,1,6303589154,"Old Stoneface palys a professional killer called out of retirement by an old friend to assassinate a Latin American torturer.
The is a cheap, schlocky piece of rubbish of asppeal to Bronson diehards only. It is in it  purely for the senationalism and the violence and posts a number of pretty  (unintentional funny) scenes and plot developments.  For example - the  torturer is played by Joeseph maher, who talks in an upper class English  accent.  He has a lesbian sister who he appears rather too fond of.  At one  point Stoneface breaks into her bedroom and has to hide under the bed  whilst she has lesbian sex with her maid.  Another ""classic"" is  that Bronson and his woman follow Raymond St Jacques to a seedy bar (full  of degerates and hookers at about 1 in the afternoon) where he first  casually breaks a man's neck in a row and then lures St Jacques back to his  place on the promise of a threesome.  This is also one of these movies when  no-one is ever around so Bronson is able to drive around Maher's guarded  complex in the middle of town numerous times, and shoot someone outside and  drive off, and not be caught or noticed by anyone.
Finally, Maher is  killed by his disfigured victims in a scene resemmbling a Fulci Zombie  movie.
Flatly directed by the man who made The Guns of Naverone (how have  the might fallen) and totally worhless in all respects.",953164800,2,1375,4.530612244897959

Does he get  his man ?. -Let's just say, the ending is right out of Tod Browning's  ""Freaks""(MGM,1932.) The whole cast is actually way too good for  this kind of violent film. I think the opening scene is a bit too much, but  typical of the brutal stuff Bronson appeared in during the 80's. -Not  exactly a pleasure-cruise.",928800000,2,602,4.527777777777778

703684,3,6303589154,"Charles Bronson's last Hollywood studio film before he went to work for Cannon Pictures full-time is also one of his better past-his-prime efforts.  The story has Bronson playing a retired assassin who goes back on the job one last time when his journalist friend is murdered by ""the doctor"", a specialist who trains various South American governments in the administration of brutal, endlessly prolongued torture.  ""The doctor"" travels with a deadly entourage and also has deep ties to the CIA.  When the South American country where is is living kicks him out to give the impression that it's trying to improve its human rights record, Bronson's assassin has two weeks tops to take out ""The Doctor"" before he leaves the country and possibly disappears for good.

While the torture subplot makes this a bit more serious than your normal Bronson shoot-em-up the script is smart enough that the film never really feels like a sleazy or opportunistic piece of exploitation.  ""The doctor"" is a believable villain who is never cartoonish and Bronson's motivation isn't political--but by having ""The Doctor"" protected by CIA agents the film at least acknowledges our complicity in torture in South America.  It's not heavy-handed but The Evil That Men Do at least seems to be taking place in the real world.

Charles Bronson is excellent.  Joseph Maher who plays the villain is quite effective as well.  The very serious weakness of The Evil That Men Do is that it was directed by hack and way too frequent Bronson collaborator J Lee Thompson, who doesn't manage to stage a single exciting sequence anywhere throughout the film.  In terms of presentation, this is pure meat-and-potatoes action with no style or imagination, but Bronson makes it watchable and, occasionally, entertaining, despite the grim subject matter and almost painfully flat direction.

The ending of The Evil That Men Do weirdly recalls The Island of Doctor Moreau, providing possibly the movie's only real surprise.

Charles Bronson's reputation as an action star and as an actor never really survived his tenure at Cannon, where he made easily the worst films of his career.  The Death Wish sequels provide some campy laughs but are otherwise pretty terrible--except for Death Wish 5, which was made after Cannon had gone under.  Assassination feels like it was cobbled together without the money for actual action scenes.  Messenger of Death feels like large chunks of the script were never even filmed.  Then there's the rest--10 to Midnight which is surprisingly good (but was made early when Cannon still had money to throw around); Murphy's Law which is pretty solid compared with other Charles Bronson Cannon films and Kinjite, which at least isn't completely terrible.  It's a shame because Charles Bronson was one of the great action stars of his generation, certainly on a par with Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds talent-wise, but he's no longer given the respect he deserves.  Charles Bronson should be an action movie icon but if you watch the Cannon documentary Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films you get to see Alex Winter of Bill & Ted fame mock Charles Bronson, which literally made me want to puke.  But that's a pretty good indication of the reputation Charles Bronson has today.

The Evil That Men Do isn't likely to appeal to people who aren't already Charles Bronson fans but it is competently made, which is more than can be said for some of the sad and embarrassing movies he churned at Cannon.  This is definitely worth a look for Bronson fans--but probably not for anybody else.",1462060800,,3595,4.998322147651007

Directed by J. Lee Thompson.

In Surinam, South America, Doctor Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher) is capturing men and women, forcing them to have their clothing removed in humiliation, then subjects them to electrodes, torture and pain, leading to death.  The doctor just killed a woman in front of spectators and now he tortures a naked man, Jorge (Jorge Humberto Robles), by putting electrodes on his testicles and chest.

Dr. Hector Lomelin (Jose Ferrer) sails on a boat to visit Holland (Charles Bronson) at his home in the Caymen Islands to give him a personal message. Jorge has died. He tries to convince Holland to come out of early retirement to go after this mad doctor in Mexico.

Also in the cast: Joe Seneca, Theresa Saldana, Rene Enriquez, Raymond St. Jacques, Enrique Lucero, John Glover, Jorge Zepeda, Rodrigo Puebla, Angelica Aragon.

703932,4,6303589154,"J. Lee Thompson's ""The Evil That Men Do"" casts tough guy actor Charles Bronson of the ""Death Wish"" franchise as a no-nonsense professional killer who reluctantly comes out of retirement on his desert island to eliminate an individual who specializes in human torture. Dr. Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher of ""Heaven Can Wait"") interrogates and tortures prisoners for Third World Latin American dictators. The villain's surname 'Molloch' is a variation of the word 'Moloch,' an Old Testament god of the Ammonites and the Phoenicians to whom children were sacrificed by burning. The Molloch here doesn't torture children, but he is appropriately nefarious when he makes his adult victims suffer. Unquestionably, the evil doctor is a human rights violator like few you will ever see in movies. The scene at the outset of the action where his men and he attach electrodes to the nipples and genitals of a highly respected journalist Jorge Hidalgo (Mexican actor Jorge Humberto Robles) and gives him bursts to electricity to learn what he knows is pretty strong stuff even for an R-rated movie. Mind you, Thompson doesn't show the devastated areas, we simply see a completely nude man hanging in a sling with the wires trailing from his chest and pelvis. Dr. Hector Lomelin (Jose Ferrer of ""The Shrike"") visits Holland (Charles Bronson) on his island, where he resides in a kind of self-imposed exile and asks him to kill Molloch. Holland is saddened by the news of his journalist friend's death and then he watches several videos that Lomelin provides of interviews with Molloch's victims and hears about the man's horrendous crimes against mankind. Nevertheless, Holland refuses to accept Lomelin's offer until a later scene when he shows up unexpectedly at the professor's class room.

Nothing gets in Holland's way once he takes the job. He refuses to work for pay. He arranges for Lomelin to get him a woman and a child to pose as his wife and daughter so that he will attract less attention from the locals. In one amusing scene, Holland and his faux wife Rhiana Hidalgo, wife of the death journalist (Theresa Saldana of ""Defiance"") enter a dive of a bar. While Holland gets their drinks, an enormous Hispanic guy decides to join them and fondle Rhiana. Holland surprises this gigantic hombre by knocking the table out of the way and seizing the dastard by the testicles and crushing them in the iron grip of his fist. Of course, this hulk crumples into a huddle of arms and legs at Holland's feet and offers no further interference. This display of self-defense attracts the attention of Molloch's bodyguard, Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques of ""Cotton Comes to Harlem"") and he joins our hero and heroine. Shrewdly, Holland tells Randolph that Rhiana and he are looking for someone else to have sex with and the deal is sealed. They go back to Holland's motel and Holland immediately kills Randolph with a knife and hangs him upside down to bleed his corpse out in the shower.

""Guns of Navarone"" director J. Lee Thompson pulls no punches in this hard-as-nails thriller with his depiction of either Molloch's savage torture techniques or Holland's icy methods of disposing with his antagonists. Consequently, ""The Evil That Men Do"" still retains its edgy quality some twenty years after its initial release. On the other hand, Thompson doesn't resort to sensationalism for the sake of sensationalism, and this thriller is fairly straightforward without any outlandish or unbelievable scenes. This is one reason that I think makes it so good. The closest that you get to exploitative sleaziness involves Molloch's evil sister Claire (Antoinette Bower)who is a lesbian. Another scene has our hero wielding a mean pump action shotgun with deadly proficiency. Although he was past his prime at this point in his career, Bronson is nevertheless in fine form as the gimlet-eyed, tight-lipped assassin. The grim finale at a mining compound where Molloch gets his comeuppance from past disfigured victims resembles the ending of Todd Browning's horror classic ""Freaks."" The miners surround Molloch's car and shove long spikes through it with the villain trapped in the back seat with nowhere to run. The wild thing is that Joseph Maher is totally convincing as the heinous villain, but as an actor he didn't specialize in villainous roles. Theresa Saldana is convincing as Jorge's wife who accompanies Holland on his mission. People who prefer their crime dramas with a hard boiled intensity will savor this grim saga. Ken Thorne's offbeat music is a plus.",1396051200,,4544,5.0412234042553195

704033,3,6303589154,"After spending much of his career making lazy right wing revenge fantasies, 1984's The Evil That Men Do offers the comparative novelty of Charles Bronson making a left wing revenge fantasy, with his amiable hitman persuaded out of his retirement in the Cayman Islands by Jose Ferrer to take out Joseph Maher's professional torturer who's outstayed his welcome in a South American dictatorship but still enjoys the protection of the local US embassy and sleazy diplomat John Glover in return for past `favors.' Despite beginning with a lecture with practical examples on the nature of torture, Costa-Gavras this ain't, though it's not entirely politically unsophisticated even if it's the kind of film where every problem can be solved by cutting through the bureaucratic red tape and legal niceties with a gun or a well-aimed knife to the throat. Fire hoses have their uses as well...

The fifth of director J. Lee Thompson's nine films with Bronson and a distinct improvement on the previous year's dire 10 to Midnight, it's a somewhat middling and not especially graphic affair despite the subject matter: the two most worrying moments are when he says he wants to take a woman with him to pose as his wife and the awful possibility of another co-starring role for the real-life Mrs Bronson pops up (luckily he decides to take Theresa Saldana instead of a bad British actress) and when he poses as a swinger into threesomes to lure one of the bad doctor's security team to his death. For the first half of the movie it's not particularly exciting either, going through the numbers in predictable fashion before Bronson starts grabbing thugs by the privates and killing his way to his target, who in turn sets the dogs on his pursuer. There are certainly no surprises as it turns into a chase movie before the poetic justice finale, but while it's nothing special it's certainly a cut above most of Bronson's 80s efforts and it's hard not to root for him this time out.",1287619200,4,1970,4.828402366863905

Rest of cast good. Script good.

Ok, subject matter disturbing, but torture happens folks  , and at least CB makes them pay.

Essential for any CB fan.",1260835200,11,253,4.297872340425532

704038,2,6303589154,This movie was one of the most brutal Bronson movies ever. The torture scene alone was disturbing as hell. Bronson is a professional who is hired to stop a torturer for hire. It is again a brutal movie and it is only Bronson that can stop it. A good Bronson movie but not for everybody.,1251676800,2,286,4.218181818181818

704042,3,6303589154,"Every version of the movie (DVD or VHS) I've seen in the past 20 years contains the _cut_ version.  It only shows the torture of the male prisoner,  and the doctor's opening scene starts with the bloody corpse of the female.  The original version started with a monologue to the audience about the differences in terror/torture of male vs female prisoners, and showed the torture of the female prisoner (which is how she ended up on the gurney).

Without this opening, the comments about the movie failing to explore the horrors of the theme are pretty on-target. Without this opening, most of the movie makes no sense.  It was the opening that set the stage, and ingrained itself in my memory for the past 20 years.

Does the truly UNCUT version exist anywhere?  I can only think it wasn't politically correct to show the torture/murder of the female prisoner, and it was cut, and never put back in any version.  But, it was this cold, horrible, contrasts in torture that made this movie memorable, and took it out of the realm of just a gore-fest into something that gave insight into the atrocities still going on in the world.",1201564800,14,1130,4.64321608040201
