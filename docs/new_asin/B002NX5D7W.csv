8375528,5,B002NX5D7W,I saw this years ago and had download it but my hard drive crashed and couldn't remember where I download it from. Then thought amazon might have it and they did so I ordered it. The drama was about a man who want's revenge against the man who cause his family business to close which leads his brother to commit suicide. The acting in this was really great and I would recommend this since it was the last drama that Park Yong-ha was in before death in 2010.,1353801600,,459,4.2272727272727275
