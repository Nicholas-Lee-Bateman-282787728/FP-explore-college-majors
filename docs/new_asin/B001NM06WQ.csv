8327381,4,B001NM06WQ,"A live concert with the great German steel-string guitarist Peter Finger, mostly playing compositions of his own. Totentanz (dance of the skeletons) is particular fun, with his long and entertaining narration (subtitles provided). Also he shows how wonderful Bach can sound away from the typical nylon string guitar; more steel string players should be playing classical music. A PAL region free disc, so make sure your machine will play it. If you run across this and love guitar, grab it.",1291248000,,490,5.1375
