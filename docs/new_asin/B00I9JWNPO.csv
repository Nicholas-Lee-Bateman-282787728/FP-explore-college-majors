Great reenactments, and a very high level of scholarship in discussing as to why so few Greeks were able to defeat the overwhelming manpower of the Persian Empire. It was due to their superiority in body armor, and the length of their pikes.  Very highly recommended!!!!",1444953600,,296,4.9

8640175,5,B00I9JWNPO,"Could also have been called, ""Kimon, the man history forgot"". Gave it 5 stars purely on content, an excellent detailed presentation of the full story of the Greco-Persian War, would also be fantastic for students studying the period. Covers everything from an introduction about the Greeks, the Persians, Athenians and Spartans to the the aftermath and legacy of the war. Told with cutaways of drama to the life of Kimon, son of Miltiades.

Puts aside the myths (e.g. Delphi Oracle) and legends (movies like 300) and even analyses several major events and gives a clear indications of what happened and why. Great research (e.g. from Dr Chris Matthew, author ""A storm of Spears"") and even though I thought I knew everything about the period, I even learned a lot. Great analyses in particular of the Battle of Marathon and the 300 at Thermopylae. Leonidas was never on a suicide mission, by Day 3 he thought he could win, even though he was being surrounded (and most importantly, Leonidas had plenty of warning and time to plan an astonishing victory).

Going to watch it several times, so much detail, right down to how the Greek Hoplites held their spears.",1395792000,6,1159,4.848484848484849
