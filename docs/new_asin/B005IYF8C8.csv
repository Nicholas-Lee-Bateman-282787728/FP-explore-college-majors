6285009,3,B005IYF8C8,"A young man in high school develops his first relationship, deals with bullies, and tries to save his parents marriage. The first part of this film was very engaging. I found the segment with the girlfriend interesting, and I was intrigued by how the relationship was developing, and the changes that would result in his school and family surroundings. The movie then goes into part II, when he is trying to prevent the possible dissolution of his parents' marriage. This section I found a little dull, but not so much that it ruins the entire movie. It picks up again when the girlfriend becomes the focus. A modest recommendation for a film that is solid in two-thirds of its running time.",1307923200,,691,4.7190082644628095

6285042,5,B005IYF8C8,"This is the best film so far that I watched in 2016. Wait, how many films that I watched in 2016 because it's been only 18 days since 2016?
Well, I watched 2 movies everyday before I go to sleep. And they are all good ones. I don't go to theaters that much since I buy a lot of dvds and blurays.
Anyway, I really had small information about this film before watching it. And I was so much surprised when I opened the movie.
My eyes were popped everytime till the end and my head was spinning, I mean literally.
The camera was moving everytime not like other movies and that made the movie very interesting, the editing always made the movie very fun, (sometimes like one of those Chan Wook Park's movie-Oldboy)) the art work made my eyes happy(Visually stunning), and most of all the acting was more then great.
This movie is about coming of age. It seems that you've heard thousand time before? Well not at all.
Well, there was boy's first experience, trouble with his parent's relationship, trouble at school. Also sound familiar? Well still nope.
If I tell you more stories, you will keep tell me that they are familiar. and I will tell you your wrong. We are in a different page. Because how the director tell the story is totally different.
This is brand new. Gorgeous music, Great kid actors, wonderful supporting adult actors, and dream like art and locations. And most of all how he tells the story.
Also I should not forget to tell you is, the music was great. It was more then great.
I felt like I went to somewhere like in mars for 2 hours. Having an exotic tour.
I was so happy and I already want to go there again.
This movie reminded me of French film like <LEOLO><TOTO LE HERO>or even some of the TIM BURTON's films. But I wouldn't say that loud because this was even better. What? Really? Just watch it.
I am so sad that I couldn't watch this film in the theater.
This is that great.",1453075200,,1899,4.352112676056338

6285069,4,B005IYF8C8,"Much of the film liked more the life of the main character and his girlfriend. The distraught couple's romance is traditional youth but a young European point of view and European life. European everyday. I did not like the boy's parents subject that makes the film get lost and then try to return (in the end) to the dating of young boys romances. For me I studied cinema I think the script was lost unnecessarily because of the boy's parents. But in terms of aesthetics, narrative and performance of young actors is excellent. Very striking the performance of all. Taking parental subject the film is beautiful and exciting. It is very melancholic, serene and sublime. It is a simple love story very interesting. Perhaps the smartest young film on the subject. But the subject of parents almost spoils the film.",1435276800,,813,4.814285714285714

6285114,5,B005IYF8C8,"Deceptively simple script, the biopic structure works well, directing and cast are great. At first it seemed that some of the decisions central to the plot, made by the young anti-hero, were too stupid for the ""reality"" of the character. But my own memories of youthful stupidities and thousands of studies support the writers. The comedy arises naturally from the self-important seriousness of the main character, and the close to slapstick situations mixed with his fantasies. Minimalist special effects are very effective, reminding me at times of the Altered States movie.
The captions helped-- the UK has its own Dragon Naturally Speaking vocabulary for good reason.",1429747200,,671,5.339622641509434

6285123,5,B005IYF8C8,"A unique coming of age story featuring a 15 year old Oliver wrestling with his first serious relationship and the possible break-up of his parents marriage.  Set and filmed in Wales with an excellent score by Alex Turner the story follows Oliver as he pursues a girl, Jordana, who like Oliver is a bit different from their peers.  As the relationship unfolds Oliver learns his parents marriage is under stress when an ex-boyfried of his mothers moves next door.  His father, seeminly clinically depressed over job and career issues seems indifferent to his wife's boredom with the marriage and possible infidelity.  Oliver struggles to bring his parents together while pursuing Jordana.  When it is revealed Jordana's mother has a life threatening illness, Oliver pulls away from her, seemingly dooming the relationship.

  Through a host of vignettes, some funny, some quite moving, Oliver has to come to terms with his parents challenges and understand himself as a human being and learn that important relationships sometimes require painful commitment to achieve.

Beautifully acted, the story is intercut with flash to fantasy moments the segue nicely to the story.  The Welsh town and surrounding scenery is not often seen in America on film, and it is quite charming and contributes to the texture of a well told story.  The film was Executive Produced by Ben Stiller, and the roles of Oliver and his parents are reminiscent of a number of Stiller works about relationships.  It is easy to see why Mr. Stiller was attracted to the film.",1429315200,,1543,5.031496062992126

6285161,4,B005IYF8C8,"This starts out SO great, with an opening title card that had me laughing out loud, that the modest decline during it's running time is more frustrating than it really should be,

Two flaws grow as the movie goes on. The narrative gets more forced in it's eccentricity, straining a bit for effect, and robbing the dark comedy of some of the emotional power it promises to deliver, along with all the quirks. (The ending especially feels a bit of a cop out). Beyond that, over time, the explicit stylistic references to other films (the list is long but Wes Anderson in general and ""Rushmore"" in particular lead the way) started to make me question the seeming originality of the film's voice.

This is yet another off-beat film about a moody, pseudo-intellectual self-involved mid-teen odd-ball outsider. But unlike ""Rushmore"", or ""The Graduate"" that tale doesn't seem to have been made over in a whole fresh new way for it's time, and unlike ""Harold and Maude"" or even ""The Joys of Being a Wallflower"" there isn't an emotional wallop to pay it all off.

So why did I still quite like it? For one thing, the performances are very good. Young actors are always tricky and Ayoade gets excellent and subtle work from his self-serious lead Craig Roberts, and the anti-romantic and edgy object of his affections Yasmin Page. And any supporting cast with Noah Taylor and Sally Hawkins is always going to deliver. The first half really feels original and organic, in spite of the stylistic lifts. And for every time the film trips over a slightly unbelievable or convenient twist, or a too obvious homage, there is another moment that feels fresh and honest -- giving us an amusing unreliable narrator who clearly has his flaws, and ending up with a very good and inventive film about being an outsider teen. I just wish it's first sections hadn't set me up to want an even more original and all time great one.",1409097600,2,1904,4.711711711711712

6285163,3,B005IYF8C8,"Coming of age films have been hit or miss in recent yearsin fact, I think theyve been a little less
frequent compared to when I was younger. Then again, maybe coming of age films have more of an
impact when you're actually well coming of age. The new film Submarine is a self-proclaimed coming
of age film, but it doesnt look like the coming of age movies I remembered as a kid--like Porkys (1982)
or Ferris Buellers Day off (1986), and wow did I just date myself.
At 15, protagonist Oliver Tate (played by relative newcomer Craig Roberts) pursues who he believes to
be the love of his life while trying to help save his parents marriage. The girl of his dreams, played by
Yasmin Paige, is (for all intents and purposes) a pyromaniac and simply an oddball. Then again, all the
characters in this film are toooddballs that is, not pyromaniacs. But this only endears you to this
quirky, off-beat comedy all the more.
Dont be fooled by the above-the-title credit given to Ben Stiller, who was a producer for the film. Not
only is his presence in the film limited to a cameo on a soap opera that flashes on the screen for
precious seconds, but this films sense of humor cannot be traced back to a Ben Stiller style. No antics,
not much empty comedy calories in this filmso perhaps Stiller wanted to express a comedic bent we
dont get to see in many of his films. Or maybe he just wasn't that involved in writing Submarine (which
was written by another relative newcomer Richard Ayoade).
This film takes you in several different directions, and each one of them is as well constructed as the
last. The subplot of Olivers mother (played by Sally Hawkins) flirting with ex-lover now neighbor
Graham Purvis (played by Paddy Considine) is as engaging and funny a storyline as Olivers pursuit.
Roberts plays his protagonist with a lot of emotion and energyand Paige has equal depth and
vulnerabilities.",1408406400,,1892,4.633928571428571
6285164,5,B005IYF8C8,"Submarine trumps even Rushmore, although I love Rushmore. But it was re-watching Rushmore that prompted my daughter to suggest Submarine. Wes Anderson has a ""twee"" factor that has gotten out of hand recently, but Submarine has none of that. It helps that it is British, with the sardonic and subtle irony that the British are so good at, but also that the cast is largely unknown to most Americans, (although we may remember Sally Hawkins from Blue Jasmine and previously from her wonderful debut (in America, at least) Happy Go Lucky. Submarine is unexpected and rewarding, at the same time there is mystery and magic there without pretentiously calling attention to itself. The mixture between the young man's fantasy view of life and the real tragedies and mishaps that intrude (I won't give them away!) make this a wonderful coming of age story for all ages.

This one of my favorite movies of all time. It's the coming of age story of Oliver Tate, who is navigating his first relationship whilst also trying to single-handedly save his parents' marriage, only to discover that he has inherited his father's depression.
The way that Oliver's depression is handled is what makes this one of my favorite movies. In so many films, depression is overly romanticized or made to look more dramatic than it is. Another reason why I loved this movie is because Oliver's character was not at all ""protected"" by the writers. He screws up, does horrible things. Rather than wrap him up in warm fuzzies once he realizes the error of his ways, Oliver has to earn back his opportunity for a happy ending.",1387670400,,756,4.778625954198473

6285179,4,B005IYF8C8,"""Submarine, the directorial debut by The I.T. Crowd's Richard Ayoade (who also starred in the recent film, The Watch), tells the story of a young man named Oliver Tate who is entangled by the complexities he has with the relationships of his love interest, Jordana Brewster, his quiet oceanography professor for a father, and Oliver's mother willing to date someone else other than her husband.

The film, as a whole, prides on a quirky whimsy evident in much of the works of Wes Anderson (Rushmore brings into mind) and French New Wave cinema with its experimental shots of emotion and character. It is not entirely certain if Ayoade made the script with this intention or the novel characterises much of the craziness within Tate's mind. If it is one way or the other, the film is delightfully well done (in terms of cinematography, choice of music, and colour scheme), snappy, witty (in a dry way), and consistent enough to hold its own ground with its slightly schizophrenic perspective of a teenager's mentality. The film does suffer a bit with moments of too much distance and whimsical silence by its characters that it makes them a bit cartoonish.

However, the film is nonetheless more realistic, more to heart, and less sporadic than many of its modern counterparts (i.e. Superbad, Project X). In addition, the film's strong collaboration with the production team from Film4 (part of Channel 4) and Warp Films make for a work that is not only interesting but, moreover, something definitive of their established brands.""",1370131200,,1530,4.97265625
6285180,4,B005IYF8C8,"Submarine as a film is one of those strange creatures that suggests something simply from the marketing. With its vintage look and crafted quirk, one would be forgiven for thinking that Submarine was a Wes Anderson also-ran, stealing style to cover for itself.

Thankfully, that is far from the case, and Submarine instead is an entertaining (though not always fun) dance through the mine field of young love and personal self-discover, and the difficult of breaking out of the limits of childhood into adulthood. That's not to say it isn't a comedy, because it is, but Submarine is a far bleaker look at these situations than you'd fine in Wes Anderson, and instead has more in common with 70s coming-of-age stories like Harold and Maude.

If that sounds too-glowing, I'll admit that Submarine is not as good as that. It is a first film from a young director, and while it hits far more than it misses, one can't help but wonder just how much of the tonally nostalgic callbacks are genuine to memory and place and time, and how much it's simply more mining of references to try to lend gravitas to what is essentially a typical teenage story.",1367193600,,1143,4.71

Oliver Tate is a too smart, somewhat peculiar fourteen year old in love with class mate, Jordana. His parents are having marital problems, and his mother's old flame has happened to move into the house next door.

I didn't find all the characters likeable, but did find them unique and interesting. Oliver's dad is a dorky intellect, his mother screams internally for attention, so of course falls for the old flame when he gives it to her. The old flame is a pretentious new age guru.

The only character I truly disliked was Jordana. She was a very unsympathetic character. She was a bully, which bothered me, as she got Oliver to bully at the beginning as well, which is the only thing I found troublesome about his character as he only did it to gain her affections. He did at least feel remorse for it. She treated him horribly but then expected him to be at her every beck and call.

In the end there was a sort of happy ending like most movies about dysfunction. All in all, I really liked this movie. I think fans of dysfunctional family movies like Little Miss Sunshine and The Royal Tannenbaums will like this.

6285186,4,B005IYF8C8,"Submarine is an independent film with Wes Anderson undertones about a young Welsh boy and his struggles with his parents failing marriage while dealing with the trials and tribulations of his first real girlfriend.

The protagonist, Oliver Tate, is a high school boy that most will find relatable. Oliver isn't popular, but he isn't unpopular either. He spends his days floating through his classes and trying not to stand out in his uniform and black wool coat. The problem is, when he develops a crush on a classmate, Jordana. Jordana is a bit of a loose cannon in a bright red coat but Oliver can't help but be drawn to her. Eventually the two are brought together and their awkward relationship begins to bloom. Oliver must now juggle his parent's sinking love-life (something that he exhibits a little too much interest in) and his first real relationship.

In terms of production, the movie is paced well. However don't expect a roller coaster ride. This is a bio-pic about a young man, his girlfriend and his parents. It's a beautiful story and very relatable. You'll cringe at the awkward moments with him and Jordana. You'll shake your head at the valiant, if a little idiotic, efforts he makes to save his parents relationship. But in the end you'll know that when you were his age, you would've done (or maybe you did) the same things.

Filmography is where this film really shines. I stated in the introduction that this had Wes Anderson undertones. It does, but it is anything but a Wes Anderson rip off. It has a very vintage feel (it takes place in the 80s I think) and the color palettes are very deliberate and well done. There are many visually stunning scenes that capture the passion of young love and uninhibited youth.

6285191,3,B005IYF8C8,"I generally appreciate British humor and quirky comedies, and I really wanted to like this movie because I liked Richard Aoyade so much on ""The IT Crowd.""  (Just to be clear, he's the director of the film; he does not act in it.)  It wasn't a bad little movie, but it felt pretty flat overall.  The acting was good, and the story was certainly quirky enough (in fact, a bit quirkier than I cared for), but I thought the humor wasn't all that humorous.

What it really reminded me of was one of Wes Anderson's less successful efforts; so imagine what Wes Anderson's take on a coming-of-age film set in a Welsh town...directed on an off day for Wes Anderson...and that's pretty much what ""Submarine"" is like.  If that sounds awesome to you, then, seriously, have at.  Otherwise, you should probably pass.",1350518400,4,802,4.612676056338028

6285193,4,B005IYF8C8,"It's a short putt from here to a Wes Anderson movie, so if you like Anderson, this should do you just fine.

Here's the scoop. Fourteen year old Oliver Tate is in love with his classmate Jordana Bevan. Oliver's folks are having issues in their marriage and mom's old flame has moved in next door. Oliver feels compelled to get the girl and save his folks' marriage.

This is a quirky flick. Oliver is young and too bright for his age so he comes off as kind of gorpy. Jordana seems nice enough but has a dark side and harbors issues regarding closeness and commitment. Of course Oliver only sees what he wants to see in her because he wants to get in her nickers. His mom seems normal enough but dad is an intellectual stick in the mud. Her old flame is way too into himself and his ""New Age"" guru travelling show, but he's more alive than dad. This film does much to give the viewer the sense of the craziness one experiences when coming of age. The awkwardness and missteps are all brought to the forefront.

Again, this is a very quirky movie. It's set in Whales and sometimes the accents and Oliver's rapid fire delivery of a line kept me from getting everything, but I enjoyed it just the same. And this is only a happy-ish ending. You get the feeling that Oliver and Jordana, if they move into the future together, might not end up as the storybook happy couple. They both have issues to work on.

This is director Richard Ayoade's first feature length film, but he seems to have already found a voice. This is so good I will easily look forward to seeing his next outing",1346284800,4,1577,4.35374149659864
6285194,2,B005IYF8C8,"It is a pretty bold statement for a Welshman to open up his movie for thanking America for not invading his country.  And to open Submarine up further to us Yankees, the DVD cover even features the phrase ""Ben Stiller Presents"" on it.  But before Stiller (who makes a cameo in the movie) fans watch the film, please note that Submarine does not resemble any of Stiller's farces like Zoolander.  Submarine is much more subtle in its humor (to the point it is questionable that it is even a comedy) and much more dry it is wit than most Americans are used to.

Submarine is a coming of age story about a boy in Wales who embarks on his first schoolboy romance around the same time he fears his parents' marriage is falling apart.  The movie was written and directed by Richard Ayoade who may be best know (only known to the American public) for the recently movie The Watch which co-starred Stiller.  If you are a fan of broad comedies like The Watch, Submarine is not for you because only people who enjoy the slow British comedies (which I tend not to)  will probably enjoy this movie.

6285195,4,B005IYF8C8,"After receiving a string of terrible indie films to review, ""Submarine"" was a very nice change of pace.  ""Submarine"" is a small indie film from Wales telling the coming-of-age story of Oliver.  Many compare the movie to the film ""Rushmore"", but I think that it feels a bit more like ""Donnie Darko"", if all the science fiction bits were removed.  Like ""Donnie Darko"", the film is set in the 80's around a socially awkward youth who does not react to situations as most others around him might.  Unlike ""Darko"", where the angst in the main character is based in knowledge in the pending end of the world; the problems in ""Submarine"" are grounded in reality (relationship troubles, bullies, parents, etc.).

I do not know how to comment much on the movie without ruining the viewing experience.  These coming of age stories tend t follow the same plot patterns, and it is the execution that can make them interesting.  Much of the humor (as well as discomfort) in the film comes from Oliver's way of dealing with the situations in which he is placed.  In spite of his best intentions, he always errs on unintentionally dark solutions to his problems.

I try not to quote critics, but I believe Roger Ebert really put it best when he said that the film ""doesn't try too hard to be desperately clever.  It's a self-confident work for the first-time director..."".  That is what I like about the movie.  While I do enjoy the films of Wes Anderson, I think he does try a bit too hard to be simultaneously clever and a little too twee.  ""Submarine"" feels like a work of passion, and it does not feel like the director is trying to convince the audience of anything other than that.  If you enjoy indie cinema, you might quite enjoy this film.",1345507200,,1733,4.584415584415584

6285198,5,B005IYF8C8,"""My mother is worried I have mental problems. I found a book about teenage paranoid delusions during a routine search of my parents' bedroom.""

There are quite a few teen-aged, quirky, personal movies out there.  They're usually pretty good.  They either resonate or they're funny or both.  The alphas of our species will probably have to be in a listless mood to enjoy them.  For us quirks, any time is a good time.  Rushmore (1998), Easy A (2010), Juno (2007), Starter for 10 (2006), The History Boys (2006), and, now, Submarine (2011).

Oliver (Craig Roberts) is a little odd, but meeting his parents goes a long way to explain it.  Mom, Jill (Sally Hawkins), and Dad, Lloyd (Noah Taylor), are both pretty darn odd.  His girlfriend Jordanna (Yasmin Paige) is odd too.  Oliver is afraid that his mother is having an affair with total wanker, Graham (Paddy Considine), who's into mystic stuff that's so outlandish his mother's inclined to think there must be something to it.  Human relationships are complicated and Oliver does his best.  It isn't always good enough.  Poor Oliver.

This movie is so good.  It's so funny.  It's so well put together.  It's a great way to spend an hour-forty.

Great acting.  It's kind of one-dimensional for the character-almost all of the characters actually-but he's got that dimension down.  Roberts, who seems like a close cousin of Daniel Radcliffe, lays down his character and performs the voice over to perfection.  Everyone's motivation is pretty clear and understandable.  That doesn't sound like a glowing endorsement, but really, it's an aid to the script.

It's a fantastic script.  I imagine that it's a fantastic book (by Joe Dunthorne).  Bravo to he and writer/director Richard Ayoade.  The comedy is of the awkward, honest kind.  It's not brutally awkward, but the kind of normal awkward that arises when there are no good responses to events. Very British awkward.  But it's-forgive me-full of heart.  I'm not sure how original it is-I mean, this is a teenager who has trouble understanding his relationship and that of his parents-but it is freshly prepared.

Great visuals.  Most of the freshness comes from this quality.  The style is...quirky.  Have I gone over my ""quirk"" quota yet?  I hate to do that to you since it's such a non-expressive word.  I'll try something else.  It's filmed unconventionally, functionality is not the priority, colors are alternatively vivid and washed out, camera action is varied but never ""art house.""  Were those any better?  How about ""solid""?

It's great finding/seeing these movies.  I couldn't say ""finding"" by itself because that would make it seem like I've done something other than heard of it and ran across it completely by accident on Netflix Instant (sweet!).  Still, it's like coming across a Wes Anderson-before they became too quirky to function (so by Wes Anderson, I mean Rushmore)-and totally giving in to its charms.  It didn't get me drunk and take advantage.

There's a little ownership that goes with this kind of find.  It's mine and very few people share in it.  I share it with people and praise it lavishly.  It's almost like boasting.  ""Oh, you've got to see this, it's absolutely hilarious.""  You say that sometimes just to make sure everyone understands that you got the joke.  Or, in its analogous genres, have such great, high, powerful tastes in film or whatever.

Like most tastes, I can't stand it in anyone other than myself.  The boasting is obvious and patronizing.  If I don't laugh because I don't think it's particularly funny, which is probably due to the fact you're not a professional comedian, and then you have the temerity to ask ""Get it?"" you don't know how close you come to annihilation.

In self-defense, there are jokes where you are allowed to say ""Get it?""  These jokes include puns (difficult ones), very short (probably ironic) jokes, and the kind of jokes I like.  Whenever I relate a joke from Yes Minister (1980-84), I feel well within my rights to return your dumb glazed look with a ""Get it?""

However, because I am in the fraternity, you need only pause and allow me to catch up.  If I don't nod in apparent agreement (and silently prove your failure), then you may brutally dissect and explain the joke.  I'm one of those weird people who will probably laugh even then.

The strange thing about owning a part of a movie as if you're special (despite the fact that neigh on 17,000 people took the trouble to rate the thing on a website to prove how special they are) is that paradox of sharing.  I own it and I'm special, now I want you to join the cult.  If you don't (and thereby emphasize exactly how special I am), then this is an affront to me, the House of Ratigan, my tastes, and Western Civilization.

The paradox is resolved with the premise that your ownership (if accepted) is but a pale reflection of my blazing glory and when you go all new moon on it, you've disrupted my universe.  Maybe I'm just some rogue comet that meets up once every some-odd years with other, grander planets or I'm a moon to someone else's star.  Or can I be?  Is this metaphor just collapsing into itself like the universe only to reduce to nothing and then explode once again with brute denial!

I digress.

The whole movie can roughly be described as understated.  That's means it's right up my alley.  It's also British (Welsh), so it's so far up my alley, I'll see it twice.  I had high expectations for all of these reasons and they were met and exceeded.  You can't do better than that.  Definitely worth the investment.

The story is listed as a 'comedy', but I felt it was much more of a drama with a comedic point of view. I enjoyed the lack of cliches that seem to plague domestic movies these days, along with the fact that the movie was laid out to simply tell a story, and not to try to teach the viewers a lesson. Well acted/directed, it's an interesting tale with reasonably rich characters, wrapped up in an enjoyable enough fashion.

But where ""Rushmore"" was saved by the innate goodness of its hero and the movie's charmingly whimsical tone, ""Submarine"" fails to rise to the heights of the Wes Anderson film.

Oliver Tate is our hero in ""Submarine,"" a struggling teenager in the mid-1980s. A victim of a cruel hoax by the love of his young life, Oliver surprisingly finds himself in the catbird seat.  What ensues as Oliver confronts increasingly melodramatic plto points is an exercise in Oliver's complete lack of social skills and genuine empathy for his fellow man.  It's not that Oliver doesn't consider other people's feelings - it's that he thinks about them and almost invariably draws the wrong conclusion.  While many have found the movie to be both poignant and on the mark, too many key points seemed too contrived to sustain my interest.  I can suspend disbelief and will even believe the ridiculous in the context of a good movie, but ""Submarine"" is too clever and shocking by half.

""Submarine"" (2011)
----------------------------------------
Note: mild spoilers below.
----------------------------------------

This British indie film focuses on the insecurities and idiosyncrasies of a teenage loner attending a private (?) school where he hooks up with a prickly young girl and tries to form a meaningful emotional relationship inside a social context of total cynicism and detachment. Meanwhile, his family life provides a perilous example, with his totally checked-out, socially challenged father seemingly about to break up with the more functional but also emotionally remote mother. As the film opened, I sensed a kinship to the ""quirky"" films of Wes Anderson (""Rushmore,"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" etc.) which I detest for their facile irony and contempt for their easily mockable, stick-figure characters. ""Submarine,"" however, kept my interest as the familiar dynamics of precocious-young-man-in-an-absurdist-world seemed to give way to something more subtle and engaging. For one thing, the narrator-protagonist didn't seem like such a know-it-all savant, indeed, he seemed genuinely befuddled and barely able to keep ahead of the curve and maintain his public front of geekish cool. The dynamics of his relationship were odd, but not the cartoonish agit-prop of the Anderson ouvre. So, for the middle section of the film I was engaged... That changed, however, with the introduction of the family's new neighbor, a clownish New Age guru prone to martial arts hyaa-yah chops and meaningless sexual conquests: here was a classic Anderson-ian stick figure, and the tenor of the film sagged as soon as we delved into Graham's superficiality.

What I dislike about this genre is its lack of emotional resonance and the lack of respect or credence it gives its characters... The humor is facile and empty, and while ""Submarine"" is a genuinely darker and more uncomfortable film than any of Anderson's efforts, it unnecessarily dips into the same well just enough that I got a familiar sour taste. Nonetheless, it's an intriguing film, with some compelling performances (mainly the teen couple) and an odd, unpredictable tang that gives it just enough mystery to make it a worthwhile view.

Trying to begin a relationship with a girl you're interested in is never easy, but add on the potential seperation of parents that have not had sex in 7 months and it's a wonder Oliver would even try in the first place.

6285206,3,B005IYF8C8,"This somewhat sweet, somewhat creepy coming of age movie is worth watching for its quirky humor and for the sincere acting of its young cast. It is set in South Wales in the mid-1980s. By way of local color, there are some nice shots of the seashore, the hills, the local junkyards and railway depots and deserted industrial plants.

We meet Oliver, a somewhat thoughtful, somewhat geeky kid of around 15 anxious to avoid bullying, if necessary by joining in against even more vulnerable targets. His love interest is Jordana, a cute classmate with an independent streak. Both of them have problems at home.

Oliver's parents are bizarre, each in their own way. His father seems to be in the grip of clinical depression; his mother is obviously frustrated and somewhat attracted by a creepy neighbor who practices a form of ""new age"" therapy to do with light. Both are hopelessly awkward and inept with their son.

We learn later that Jordana's mother may die of a brain tumor, though when we meet her, she seems amazingly healthy. This is one aspect of the plot that totally fails to work.

Oliver earns Jordana's respect when he submits to a beating for refusing to call her a ""massive slut"". But then he loses it by failing to show up at the hospital where her mother has just undergone surgery. The two break up -- and we watch Oliver try to go through the painful mournful process we all go through when our first love affair dies. At the same time, he makes increasingly desperate and ill-judged attempts to save his parents' marriage.

In the end, all these matters are resolved and the characters walk off into the sunset.
I quite enjoyed it, my wife did not. I think it's worth watching on an evening when there's nothing on the TV and when you can't stand yet another reality show.",1330992000,,1791,4.619496855345912
6285207,5,B005IYF8C8,"I have to admit that seeing that this was produced by Ben Stiller (and a few others)is what attracted me to this little-known movie.  This movie didn't disappoint, and I sensed a bit of Stillerisms throughout this movie in both the actor playing Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts) and in the cinematography, in which scenes are flashed acrossed the screen using lighting techniques and Jacques Brel songs, a famous Belgian singer popular in mid-20th century France.

This is a unique coming-of-age movie.  All the main characters are weird (something I find Ben Stiller is famous for portraying as well).  Craig is an outsider 15-year-old determined to find a girlfriend.  He's scared enough he won't succeed in ever having one, let alone of having intimate relations with one, though.  He has a mean touch to his action, too.  His parents are weird in their own way, trying to survive or revive their own staled marriage, which is further threatened by their neighbor who is an old flame of the mother.  The parents are so consumed by their own woes that they don't see the anguish of their own son, and when son talks to mother about his attempts at finding a girlfriend, mom is only relieved her weird son isn't gay.  Is this a typical response of a parent toward their sexually-awakening son?!

The acting is stellar on all the actors' parts.  The writing is crisp and the cinematography is just as beautiful.  The sountrack is also nice in its own right, being so unusual for a British-made film.  If you aren't a fan of 1960s French music, it may hurt your ears, but it fits in well with Craig's love for French romance singers.

The movie is about love and friendship, doubt and self-doubt, but also about forgiveness and redemption.  There are some sweet and tender moments in this movie, and I found the end a bit of a surprise...or not.

This is definitely worth watching, for both Ben Stiller fans and fans of independent/British films.",1329955200,,1940,4.746268656716418
6285208,3,B005IYF8C8,"I watched this film twice--the second time to see whether I had missed anything big. I don't think I did. This is a hip and quirky coming-of-age story that is so intent on being quirky that it ends up not being very real. Fifteen-year-old Oliver Tate is a fairly typical outsider at school and is trying to land a girlfriend whose mother may be dying while he simultaneously saves his parents' marriage, which is endangered by his mother's apparent infatuation with a self-help guru.

All of this could be the standard plot, give or take a bit, for any number of films, but ""Submarine"" is indeed different. For example, this fifteen-year-old boy listens to French crooners. He also makes films, at least in his dreams. In fact, he does a great number of things that, individually, might be credible of any particular fifteen-year-old boy but which, collectively, took the story out of the realm of believability for me. I still enjoyed the film, but I couldn't really get over the fact that I really did not believe in the characters. Nearly all of them seemed to be--I don't know what the right word is here. They're not stereotypes, certainly, or clich&eacute;s. They're not archetypes. They just seem to be odd for the sake of being odd. And oddness does lead to some funny moments, but this is a film that just didn't work well for me.

I'm sure there will be others who love this, and I certainly would like to see more from writer/director Ayoade, who I think shows great potential. But ""Submarine"" was a mildly amusing diversion for me, little more.",1329696000,,1556,4.695970695970696
6285209,5,B005IYF8C8,"Given the fact that Submarine is prefaced by an introduction claiming that it is ""an important film, watch it with respect,"" I had my doubts going in. Many indie films find themselves to be far more important than they actually are. The ""produced by Ben Stiller"" label that can be found on the DVD cover and in the opening credits wasn't a good sign either. Films that advertise a famous person who didn't direct or star in it (though Stiller has a very minor cameo), generally do so because they don't have much else going for them. But once Submarine got started, I was blown away by the film's undeniable charm.

Submarine is told from the perspective of Oliver Tate, a young fifteen-year-old bent on saving his parents relationship and losing his virginity. Young Oliver is a genius and carries the typical pretentiousness that you might expect, but his obliviousness is countered by his vulnerability. Oliver isn't the kind of guy you would like if you went to school with him, but you can't help but feel sympathy for him as you watch him struggle with situations that he can't control.

Coming of age movies have been done for decades, but it's still incredibly satisfying when one's done properly. He struggles with girls as any fifteen year old would, but he doesn't turn to outlandish stunts to get his girlfriend Jordana, who dumped in after he struggled to offer her comfort while her mother battled cancer, back. He doesn't stand outside her window blasting Peter Gabriel from a boom box and he doesn't deliver any one-liners. His approach is rather normal. This might be unappealing to some who look to movies as an escape from reality, but indie fans will gobble this movie up.

Submarine is an incredibly clever movie, but it's powered by humor that one might find in real life. It's advertised as a biopic and it lives up to that, even if the bio is about someone that isn't famous at all. You get to know Oliver and you get to care about him. It goes beyond the struggles of a too smart for his own good teenager searching to get laid, it's a tale of humanity that anyone can relate to. You wouldn't expect a movie about a fifteen-year-old Welsh boy to carry universal appeal, but you'd be surprised.

If you like indie movies, give Submarine a shot. I still don't think it's an ""important film"" as it may claim to be, but it's certainly one of the most charming movies I've seen in a long time. The art of the teen film was perfected in the 80s and many films have failed to reinvent the wheel. Submarine doesn't come from the same mold as The Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles, but it does show the vulnerability that teenage years inevitably usher in. Few films enter that territory for any other reason that to get a few laughs. While I don't mean to put those films down, I appreciated Submarine's effort to accurately portray the realization of helplessness that many teenagers experience.",1328140800,,2913,4.6395348837209305

As with many British films depicting ""coming of age"" such as ""Wish You Were Here"" to ""Trainspotting"", there is always a feeling that you are missing something because there is a underlying cultural difference that you can never quite pinpoint.  Submarine has some of this, but not as much as other films of this type.

There are quite a few vibes you get when watching ""Submarine"", which is kind of expected, since there was nothing really ""new"" in the film, it seemed to borrow styles from other films. I guess the strongest vibe you feel is that it is like ""Rushmore"", this is true, especially the narrative style. I also got the vibe from Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" as much of the movie deals with Oliver's parent's relationship, his mother's affair, and how they handle the situation.  This is reflected on his own relationship with his new girlfriend.  It's hard to talk about this film without giving to much away, so I won't.

In case you were wondering if I liked the film, I did. It had the usual indie quirkiness, plus there was one point in the movie that they were lighting flares, sparklers and setting things on fire that reminded me of the Snow Patrol video for ""Run"" as Oliver tosses a flaming bicycle into the water.  What I did find lacking however is a good soundtrack. There only appeared to be music by a singer-songwriter named Alex Turner, and I could take it or leave it. Maybe he is big in Wales, I don't know.  Since the movie took place in an undetermined time in the 80's (imDb says it's 1986), the music choices are abundant , but I'm sorry to say that there probably was no budget for music in this movie. Music probably would have made this movie a bit more enjoyable, just look at Rushmore's outstanding soundtrack. You remember the movie just as much for the music as the movie. That could also have been a director's decision to keep the soundtrack minimalist, I don't know. I have not the Special Feature ""The Making of Submarine"" - maybe that will clue me in. Maybe I will also learn about the prominence of the four colors throughout the film that some of the characters wear - blue, red, yellow and black - The most obvious being  Yasmine in her prominent red coat.

I find that most of the movies that hit my DVD player lately are from the Weinstein Company (in this case there are seven other companies involved as who produced the film), it seems that they have the ""pulse"" on good indie entertainment right now, plus their movies seemed to win a lot of Golden Globes.

6285215,4,B005IYF8C8,"Submarine is a thoughtful, stylish, azure-tinted coming-of-age story that tells a familiar tale in a clever but never pretentious way. Oliver Tate is young, alienated and beset by delusions of grandeur. He believes he is supremely important yet his place in the universe has not yet revealed itself--aside from being an accessory to the occasional pond-plunge for the fat girl at school. He spies on his parents' love-making habits and tinkers in his room or stands pensively at the ocean's edge, awaiting inspiration that seems a long way off. Enter the girl in the stark red jacket who would change his life for the better--or at the very least add a little color. Relatedly, Oliver's ex-actress mother is searching for a bit of color herself to save her from the pervasive doldrums that plague her marriage with a marine biologist and chronic depressive whose only relatively alluring feature--beyond his stellar beard--is his ability to create relationship mix-tapes that encompass both passionate beginnings and unavoidable despondency. The way in which Oliver's mother tries to save herself is quite comical as she attempts to join forces with a neighboring `ninja' whose self-help ramblings end up relating to improving one's sphere of color by never-fully-explained self-transcendence. Color, inevitably, conjoins the worlds of both Oliver and his distant parental units. It is of supreme importance. Submarine, as a whole, manages to balances Oliver's quasi-romantic exploits with his attempts to alter the grim course of his parents` marriage without seeming the least bit manipulative or over-done. The visual palate is washed out but peppered by various flairs such as title cards and fades to red or blue. The dialogue is snappy as an asp in your palms and without a doubt, the performances by young Noah Taylor and Yasmin Paige are phenomenal. Overall, anyone familiar with the work of Wes Anderson or Noah Baumbach should be feel comfortable wading into these waters. The film is melancholic without being depressing and relatable without being stale: biting with dry wit, arsonist young love and all the fast-cut magic of modern cinema, it is not to be missed.",1325721600,,2176,5.22

6285217,3,B005IYF8C8,"SUBMARINE is a very quirky, deeply INDIE-feeling movie.  It's set in lower class England, and involves a ""coming of age"" story for the very quirky, very INDIE-feeling Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts).  He's a bit of a loner...his only friends being boys who torment him only a little less than the rest of the school population.  But he's managed to catch the eye of the quirky, very INDIE-feeling Jordana (Yesmin Paige), and attempts to chart his way through his first experience with young love.

This is the kind of film where the main character provides significant narration.  He's also one of those kids prone to blank looks, the ""affectless"" attitude so often seen in modern films about troubled teens.  The movie is slow paced, the accents thick and the humor of the most subtle kind.  It's not really a comedy, but more of a quirky drama.

You may gather from my repeated use of the words ""quirky"" and ""indie"" that I find the film to be predictable and tired.  And much of it is.  The mood, the camera angles, the narration, so much feels SO terribly familiar.  What was once (what, maybe 20 years ago?) a fresh approach to storytelling now feels as clichd as the any Hollywood film...just on a lower budget.  I found the first half of the movie to be almost unbearably familiar.

But something happened along the way that pulls this film out of the trash heap.  It actually deals with some real emotions.  Most importantly, we come to understand that although Oliver's parents are quirky...the fact that their relationship is crumbling is actually a cause of some very real anxiety for Oliver.  He WANTS his parents to stay together.  He loves them and can tell they love him...but he also wants his family unit for the security and stability they bring him.  He's as surprised to discover it as we are.  His dad (Noah Taylor, who turns out to be quite amusing and endearing by the end) is a biologist who barely makes a living, and seems incapable of bringing any excitement to his wife.  Mom (Sally Hawkins) is coasting on the edge of leaving her family when who should move in across the street but her extremely quirky former boyfriend (Paddy Considine in a terrific mullet!) and his wife.  The old boyfriend is a low-rent psychic, giving lectures and selling VHS tapes of those lectures, complete with terrible special effects.  Mom is drawn to him, because he is alive and full of energy, even if he's also full of BS.  Oliver senses danger, and in his own quirky way, tries to restore order to the family.

In the meantime, Jordana begins to let her guard down with Oliver, and the two grow close despite her stated desire to remain aloof.  It's a subtle change, and I also liked that the question of Oliver losing his virginity is handled in a humorous and relatively dignified manner.  And when Jordana has an emotional crisis of her own, the testing of their relationship actually contains some surprises.

SUBMARINE is still hopelessly enthralled with the trappings of indie filmmaking.  But beneath that predictable veneer, some fine ideas and good performances are there for your enjoyment.  I can't give this film a strong thumbs-up...but for a patient filmgoer, there are more worthwhile moments that I would have expected.",1325462400,,3243,4.761648745519714

6285219,4,B005IYF8C8,"The life of Oliver Tate is glib. He's not popular at school, his parents are growing farther apart, and he's trying to find meaning in his existence. When a mysterious girl draws him into his first romantic relationship, everything seems to fall into place. Until a strange self help guru moves in next door and his mom seems to take a fancy to him.

SUBMARINE is a hybrid of coming of age story, comedic drama, and experimental filmmaking. The story marches along in different parts, almost like a short story collection.

Oliver (played by Craig Roberts) is a strange, albeit charming protagonist who himself is a combination of Walter Mitty, Max Fischer from ""Rushmore,"" and Paul McCartney (it's the hair and wardrobe.) He's aggravating in the beginning, but as the film progresses, he's actually funny and awkward. The people around him add to the awkwardness: his girlfriend Jordana, perceived as a quiet bully, has more story to her than she lets on. Oliver's parents are polar opposites who start off flat and never fully develop, which is unfortunate because there was a lot of potential for their plot. And seeing Paddy Considine in a mullet doing martial arts is a blast.

The music fits in to the film with ease, gliding along with an air of longing and pretentiousness which spoke to me. Pretentiousness is overrated, yet I can't help but enjoy the songs which highlight Oliver's life.

I enjoyed watching this; however, it felt like the film was trying to be over the top just because it could. This isn't necessary. I don't see the need to constantly be quirky when there is some good material in the first place. It's not bad though, just a detail which can be overlooked while you're watching.

Music selection is okay. Maybe it fits the film best. Break down though and use some music that is less, hmmm, eclectic or pretentious(?). Whatever.
Nice actors chosen for the roles. Sally Hawkins is always attractive and the dad was excellent.
Profanity, sexuality, violence, political tilt are all acceptable and nonexistent.
Nothing offensive except a strange message at the film start about America not invading England and rubbish. Is this supposed to reflect a child's attempt at political awareness and making his voice heard? A message as delivered from Oliver, I suppose, which might fit the film context.

This fact is not helped when mom's ex-boyfriend becomes their next-door neighbor.

As he struggles with this issue, Oliver is also facing problems at school - he is not the most popular kid, and becomes romantically attracted to Jordana Bevan (Yasmin Paige), a dark-haired beauty who is not above tormenting the weaker ones amongst the student population. Despite this, Oliver is hopelessly drawn to Jordana and goes about trying to win her heart.

Frankly, I did not find the central characters very likable, but the storyline is interesting and the cast does a credible job in their respective performances. It is amazing what a good ensemble cast can bring to a production, and Submarine fares well as a result.

6285222,2,B005IYF8C8,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  If you're a fan of quirky indie films such as 'Harold and Maude' or anything by quirky indie director Wes Anderson, then first-time director Richard Ayoade's 'Submarine' is for you. As for the rest of us, better to find something more rooted in a sensible, historical reality. This is not to say that Mr. Ayoade is not without talent. His background is in music video as well as being well known for his comic performance on a British TV show, 'The IT Crowd'. Ayoade does wonders with the camera, turning his Welsh urban landscape into a veritable palette of most inviting sights and sounds.

  Unfortunately, Ayoade drew his inspiration from the 2008 novel of the same name, by Joe Dunthorne. While I haven't read the novel, I'm told that the film sticks fairly closely to the novel's plot, which features the unlikeable protagonist, Oliver Tate (played by Craig Roberts, who bears a striking resemblance to another famous quirky character, Bud Cort, of 'Harold and Maude' fame). Roberts has Oliver offering up an almost deadpan, monosyllabic delivery throughout the film, which some may find to be cool or amusing, but for me it's symptomatic of Submarine's overall monotonous tone.

  Submarine's main problem is that it's protagonist, Oliver, is not endearing at all. Most 'coming-of-age' stories feature protagonists who are basically good people with one characteristic flaw. In Oliver's case, it's the opposite: most of his actions are cruel and he fails to have his grand epiphany until the film's denouement.

  Set in the mid-80s in Wales, we're introduced to Oliver as he's fantasizing what his community's response would be, had he passed away at his current age of fifteen. If that isn't morbid enough, it gets worse when Oliver decides to impress Jordana, a schoolmate he has a crush on, by bullying another overweight schoolmate, Zoe, who ends up falling into a pond as a result of Oliver's taunts. To make matters worse, Oliver types up a manual for Zoe, advising her how not to be a victim and delivers it to her only friend, only to discover that Zoe has left school and moved as a result of all the bullying.

  Oliver and Jordana become victims of bullying themselves, after Jordana takes Polaroid pictures of Oliver and her kissing, and distributes them to classmates in order to make an ex-boyfriend jealous. As a result of their new found isolation, the two become closer. While well-intentioned, Oliver's continuous clueless actions cannot be excused because he's old enough to know right from wrong. At one point, after reading a book that offers the opinion that children are able to cope with death better as a result of experiencing the death of their own pets, Oliver considers poisoning Jordana's dog so that she can cope with her mother's impending death from a recent terminal cancer diagnosis. Oliver alienates Jordana further when he decides it's a better idea to leave Jordana alone as she copes with her stricken mother in the hospital.

  The second part of the 'Submarine' plot involves Oliver's suspicions that his mother has been having an affair with next-door neighbor Graham Purvis, a new-age Guru, who peddles a wacky 'system' involving emotions and the color spectrum. Oliver's Dad is a depressed marine biologist who hardly seems upset when Oliver informs him that his mother might be having an affair. Oliver engages in the creepy surveillance of his mother and Graham at a New Year's Eve party at the beach. Later, he spies Graham and his mother entering Graham's trailer together and assumes the worst. There's more bad conduct from Oliver when he gets drunk and attempts to trash Graham's home, before passing out.

  It's supposed to be funny when Oliver's parents coddle the wayward Oliver after the break-in as well as the mother admitting that she gave Graham a 'hand job', but at the same time indicating that she and her husband were reconciling (remember, anything can happen in a movie with 'quirky' characters!).

  After all of Oliver's troublesome conduct during the film, director Ayoade wants us to conclude that ""youths will be youths"". Somehow, all the bad behavior is not so bad after all, since clueless Oliver was well-intentioned at the same time. Oliver's 'reward' at film's end is the implied reconciliation with love interest, Jordana. But there is little remorse from Oliver, who really needs to make up for all his bad conduct, especially the bullying he engaged in with his formerly besieged and ostracized classmate.

  For all those who are enamored with these type of films featuring 'quirky' characters, I can only point out that they seem to operate in their own separate but dubious moral universe. Admire 'Submarine' for its neat cinematography and clever editing, but please recognize that such tomes add nothing to the pantheon of true art house fare.",1324080000,4,4879,4.983970406905056

This film that is rated R makes some very weird twists and turns. I can honestly say that I was confused at times in what it was trying to actually say!

6285225,3,B005IYF8C8,"Perhaps I just wasn't in the right mood when I saw this, but it really didn't do a lot for me: It seems like the story is filled with characters who are emotionally immature and somewhat-if-not-entirely unkind (Oliver, Jordana) and/or those who are so overwhelmed by their situations that they've chosen to become numb to the world (Oliver's parents, Jordana).  As we leave the characters at the end of the film, it didn't seem to me that the characters had really grown all that much.  Perhaps this is trying to be a very realistic portrayl of how the world works, but I guess I look for good stories to be a bit more interesting than what we experience in everyday life.  Heck, I was hoping that everyone would just go their separate ways rather than ending up still together but maybe just a skosh better-adjusted; I couldn't help but to think the characters would have been better off in that situation.

The story is somewhat-if-not-spectacularly interesting, as we get to experience the school year of Oliver with Jordan as well as the mundane working life of his parents (and a bit of Jordana's parent) and the possible re-kindling of an old flame between Oliver's mother and the next door neighbor... while Oliver tries valiantly (if horribly awkwardly) to keep his parents together.

The acting is fine as are the production values -- that's why I'm still giving this 3 out of 5 stars.

I'm thinking this might be better in its book form, where you do have the opportunity to really know what's going on inside the characters' heads?  As-is, I couldn't really recommend the purchase of this movie.",1322956800,,1606,4.734767025089606
6285226,3,B005IYF8C8,"Submarine is a witty, occasionally sardonic, film shot in a distinctly Wes Anderson-like style, about Oliver (Craig Roberts) a quirky young man coming of age as he deals with his first love and his parents' deteriorating marriage. The film, written and directed by Richard Ayoade and executive produced by Ben Stiller, follows Oliver as he navigates tricky emotional waters both at home and in school: His girlfriend's mother is dying and the sheer terror of it is often too much for him to handle, leaving him less responsive and supportive than his girlfriend would like. Simultaneously, Oliver tries to sabotage what he perceives as a burgeoning affair between his mother and a wildly narcissistic self-help guru next door (a hilarious supporting performance by Paddy Considine).

It sounds like unbearably intense material, but the narrative style is a dry, deadpan one that keeps the tone light and occasionally makes one laugh out loud. I mentioned that the style is pure Wes Anderson and viewers of Anderson's work can probably guess what that means: strong, very graphic, visuals and compositions; prolonged set pieces set to popular music; deadpan delivery; offbeat humor; and heavy use of narration.

As in Anderson's work, you see here a director very much in command of his material. The film is visually beautiful and expressive; it's at all times witty and entertaining, and occasionally very funny; and the performances are all excellent (Sally Hawkins plays Oliver's mother and is wonderful as usual). What it lacks, however, is a strong emotional core that leaves one truly moved as well as entertained. It is a weakness shared by Wes Anderson's lesser works, but overcome in his best (The Royal Tanenbaums). What I mean is that, to a remarkable degree given what the characters are going through, we don't care about them all that much: both central relationships (Oliver and his girlfriend, Oliver's parents) could rot and one doesn't get the sense that the characters would be worse off. There's a vulnerability that's missing in these characters to make them feel more relatable and human. It's the risk that comes with having a story that is so strongly stylized -- and no amount of wit and charm can mitigate it. What would have, I think, taken the film to another emotional level, would have been a sublime moment or two written into the script and delivered with heart: I'm thinking of the moment in The Royal Tanenbaums when the off-the-wall eccentric character played by Ben Stiller confesses to his father ""it's been a very tough year dad"" and suddenly all of his strangeness takes on a new dimension and we're seeing a scared, lonely human being in all his complexity. It's moments like that which reveal the heart beneath all the craziness and make a truly indelible story out of what could otherwise have been just an exercise in style.

I wouldn't say Submarine is just an exercise in style - there is material here that resonates and the central metaphor (of which the title is a part) is a compelling one - but if there were moments that truly moved, they eluded me. Still, it is a very solid piece of filmmaking and a thoroughly entertaining way to spend an hour and a half.",1322179200,,3209,4.895220588235294

The protagonist, Oliver, played by Craig Roberts from the Being Human spin-off webshow, is not a nice character, nor is he likeable, and yet, the audience continues to watch his progress throughout this film. to say that the protagonist learns something throughout the ideal is to attempt to apply the regular Hollywood formula onto this film. Such a superstition would be a mistake.

This is a movie that doesn't predictably go where you'd expect, but that is not where it's funny bone lies. The humor in this film is that, like in life, one never knows where our paths may lead us.

Due in part to the sensibility of Roberts, as well as the witty dialogue, this film leaves an impression on you.

My favorite scene is when Oliver asks each of his parents who they are more likely to save in a fire - him or the other parent. The answer may surprise you. But what is more surprising is the kind of revelation that leads to about each character, their storyarc, and the viewer.

I went into it knowing nothing about the movie, and came out of it feeling like I had just spent time with a close friend.

Ultimately, 'Submarine' is an exploration of a young man's adolescent failures and tiny successes, but every thought that 'Oliver Tate' (our hero) stammers aloud is met with touches of humor, confusion, anger, conflict, romance and anxiety from both the cast around him and the audience.  'Submarine' is perfectly cast and hits its mark time and time again.  I had a great time hanging out with Oliver and his family, and reliving the awkwardness and thrills of young love and adolescence.

6285229,5,B005IYF8C8,"At first viewing, you might think SUBMARINE is a film produced for teenagers going thru COMING OF AGE problems, ie first serious relationship, changing relationships with parents, being harassed by school chums, etc. However, NOBODY really has a youth like this. The film's characters and their situations are idealized, exaggerated stereotypes. SUBMARINE centers around Young Oliver, and his problems stemming from his self absorbed, self reflective philosophizing of his life. Oliver's EYE is the film itself, a film that cleverly shows Oliver agonizing over relationships, family and depression. His self reflective, artistic world is revealed thru the device of films within films. Oliver is constantly OBSERVING his world, filming with his eyes, just as we are observing him as the movie viewer. For example, you have the ""student film"" scene of the two young lovers running on the beach, filmed in super 8 style, all shakey, overexposed, etc. Various dreams and daydreams work as film within film as well. His girlfriend intuitively understands and promotes the process, forcing Oliver to take polaroids of their FIRST KISS, and record it immediately into his diary. Almost NOTHING happens in the film without Oliver being in, or being shown observing the scene. If you enjoy a movie that's a ""Visualized Confessional Diary"", employing symbolism, both blatant and subtle, then you're sure to enjoy this movie. Its not as surreal as some films of this genre become (SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD comes to mind), but there's enough creativity with the cinematic motifs, to keep the age old theme of FIRST LOVE fresh.

The film is called SUBMARINE for a good reason...everybody in the film is sinking into their own inner ocean of depression at some point. The main characters, and their setting, are all strongly connected to the ocean. From the father's job as oceanographer, the huge fish tank in Oliver's house dominating the domestic scenes, the shots of Oliver with and without his girlfriend contemplating the ocean while depressed, the daydreams of drowning, Oliver's slow movement into the ocean at the film's end, and the constant reminder that the ocean is ""6 miles deep"", the symbol of the OCEAN is the motor driving the film's plot. Each of the characters are in a SUBMARINE, six miles deep, and disconnected from each other. Getting OUT of their submarines, and discovering healthy human relationships, is the GOAL of the characters. As the true antagonist, the ocean represents the self-indulgent, over-emotional qualities of a teenager (or adults acting out their teenage dreams). If you took the symbolism out of the film, it would be a rather ordinary, boring look at two teenagers in crisis, and their families. What makes this film cool, is this intricate, intriguing use of symbolism, from the point of view of OLIVER as a young artist both sinking into, and floating upon, the Ocean of feelings he struggles with thruout the film.

Jordana herself is not so pleasant, she's a rather remote young lady who is not above bullying her less fortunate classmates.  Oliver, however, is smitten, and sets about trying to win her love.

Meanwhile, Oliver's parents seem to be slowly drifting apart: his father suffers from bouts of depression and his mother is becoming way too close to an old beau, a new age guru, for Oliver's comfort.  Oliver can see his family on the verge of falling apart and it drives him to desperate acts.

These characters struggle through their lives against a gloomy Welsh seaside background that is a perfect reflection of their moods.  None of these people is from Sunnybrook Farm, they definitely have theiri all to human flaws.

6285231,4,B005IYF8C8,"Equally bittersweet, melancholy, funny, and of course the nebulous and lazy word used to describe movies such as this, quirky, Submarine is ultimately quite good and touching if a bit derivative. In fact, when the film frees itself from the self-conscious ""quirkiness"" (again, I really dislike that term but it does fit in this case) of its first half and delves deeper into its emotional core, it improves a great deal. Written and directed by Richard Ayoade from the book by Joe Dunthorne, Submarine tells the story of Oliver Tate, a sensitive, intelligent, slightly nerdy, verbose, affected, solitary teenager dealing with his first real relationship and the possibility of his parents' marriage ending.

While not the most original premise, Submarine does manage to find its own voice eventually but still manages to wear its influences on its sleeve. The most obvious is of course Wes Anderson, right down to the nonspecific time period (the older technology seems to put the film in the 80s, but there's nothing that specifically anchors it there). The Welsh setting is used well to give the film a distinct identity, and the cinematography really showcases the beautiful landscape. Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys provides original songs whose melancholy beauty matches the film's tone perfectly.

The cast is uniformly good. Craig Roberts keeps Oliver sympathetic with just the right amount of confidence, vulnerability, and charm. Noah Taylor and Sally Hawkins are perfectly understated as Oliver's depressed father and conflicted mother. Paddy Considine manages to find some depth in his somewhat thankless and ridiculous role as a psychic guru. Yasmin Paige plays Oliver's aloof, somewhat inscrutable love interest Jordana. Both character and actress are a good counter-balance to Oliver. While this is Oliver's story, Jordana has well-defined motivations and is a fully developed character, not the typical poorly drawn object of affection usually seen in films like this. She's no manic pixie dream girl and how Oliver believably, although regrettably, reacts to her character's situation later in the film, along with Oliver's bond with his father, is the heart of the film.",1321228800,,2190,5.326589595375722
6285232,2,B005IYF8C8,"Submarine is one of those quirky and eccentric coming-of-age comedies in the vein of Rushmore.  Unfortunately, it's too quirky and eccentric for its own good.

Oliver Tate (Roberts) is a peculiar young man growing up in Wales.  He finds himself with his first girlfriend, a peculiar firebug (Paige), while trying to save his peculiar parents' peculiarly sexless marriage.

First time director Richard Ayoade, who also wrote the screenplay (based on the novel by Joe Dunthorne), is primarily known for his acting, having starred in one of the best comedy series in the last 20 years, The IT Crowd (a British show, available on DVD in the U.S., highly recommended).  He tries to hard to emulate Wes Anderson, but falls short.  Hell, sometimes even Anderson himself can be too ""Anderson-y"" (sic).

6285233,1,B005IYF8C8,"Negatives:
(1.) Breathtaking scenic backdrop only if you've been raised and spent your entire existence in the urban jungle otherwise just a few quick scenes of brushy small hills and a really run-of-the-mill ocean beach (e.g. a few rocks and a few small waves that a chipmunk would find surfable).
(2.) Nothing creative, different or memorable in the recycled countless times before storyline of two socially outcast teens who form an attachment with each other. Also nothing new in the same old issues with parents whether it's lack of understanding, lack of coolness, health issues or whatever.
(3.) Actors did a decent job of portraying their roles with appropriate quirkiness but the scripted roles themselves were just unbelievably unbelievable. Almost as if the writer was autobiographically retelling yet embellishing his own growing up isolated problems.

Positives:
(1.) The DVD was free.
(2.) In three days, no residual memory - simply forgotten.",1319241600,8,957,5.337748344370861

Stylishly directed by British comic Richard Ayoade, the story revolves around a quirky, precocious, sometimes mordant teen (Craig Roberts) who works at impressing a semi-pretty classmate in his seaside Welsh village while simultaneously attempting to save his coolly remote parents' marriage.  Dramatic and funny, this great looking film perfectly conveys the awkwardness of adolescence as well as it's fleeting rewards.  I love these ""English Village"" movies with their dark humor.

Funny, imaginative, intelligent and beautifully beautifully filmed - heartbreakingly so at times, making the most of it's South Wales setting in mountains and coast, but one of the most incredible sequences in recent cinema is played out in the empty amusement park.  This is a confident film dbut by Richard Ayoade.  The story is touching and easy to empathise with.  The tone and style provoking easy reminiscence for anyone who grew up in the UK in the 1980's.  The action itself it skin crawlingly uncomfortable at times, inspired at others but always captivating; it is exceptionally acted, the characters intriguing and fascinating.  Your mind flicks between each of them, trying to understand them and their stories.  The Alex Turner soundtrack is superb and worked seamlessly into a film that is not afraid of the quiet.  Also, the French art film inspired sectioning of the film is achingly cool and adds to intellectual feel.  But this film can still be enjoyed on many levels.

As you can tell I'm somewhat enamoured with this film, it's the first thing to come close to my all time favourite; the Virgin Suicides.  It's a close call and I'd call it a draw for the time being.",1318723200,,1214,4.844660194174757
6285236,4,B005IYF8C8,"The movie takes place in Wales. After missing the first joke, I added the English subtitles. The story is told in first person by school boy Oliver Tate who spends time daydreaming. His vivid imagination is humorous. Oliver has fantasies about Jordana, another semi-outcast. She uses Oliver to make her former boyfriend jealous. Jordana has eczema and likes to set fires. Oliver's mother is a paranoid who believes her tongue is too big for her mouth. Dad is a boring marine biologist who gives Oliver love advice, claiming that if you rip your vest open in front of a woman, you can get a positive response. Oliver believes his mom is having an affair with the neighbor Graham, her former boyfriend, who is a ""ninja psychic.""

Like too many indies, after they create wonderful quirky characters, the film moves to a less than spectacular climax scene and equally sub-par ending with lame music to make you feel good. 3 1/2 stars.

6285237,4,B005IYF8C8,"""Submarine"" is a coming-of-age dramedy set in Wales of the 1980s, narrated by its 15-year-old protagonist Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts). This is one of those rare cases where voiceover narration is not superfluous. Oliver is a socially awkward, introverted, slightly odd young man confronted with two challenges: getting a girlfriend and preventing his parents' relationship from disintegrating. Pretty mundane stuff and common grist for independent films. I've seen it all before -too many times. But Oliver and his annoying girlfriend and sweetly unhappy parents grew on me. This is Richard Ayoade's first feature film, which he wrote and directed, based on Joe Dunthorne's 2008 novel. He just hits the right notes. The trick is that Ayoade is not afraid to let Oliver be a selfish jerk.

Oliver has his sights on his mildly pyromaniacal classmate Jordana (Yasmin Paige), and his plan is to win her over by bullying a chubby girl, which he thinks Jordana will find amusing. She does -then she tries to use Oliver to make her ex-boyfriend jealous. At least Oliver gets the girl. Then he wonders what he is going to do with her. Meanwhile, his ""naturally neurotic"" mother Jill (Sally Hawkins) is feeling lonely and frustrated in the face of his depressed, dweeby father Lloyd (Noah Taylor). Jill's old flame Graham (Paddy Considine), now a new age guru, has moved in next door, providing Jill an outlet for her emotions...and possibly and end to her marriage. But Oliver is determined not to let that happen.

Oliver tends to do all the wrong things. And not because he's hapless and loveable. He does the wrong things on purpose. He's selfish and odd. I must give him credit for never doing the obvious. But there's something endearing about him after a while. His quiet determination is reflected in the film's tone. Although the parents are peripheral characters, I found them the most sympathetic. They're patient with their son and ultimately with each other. The DVD (Anchor Bay 2011) bonus features are 9 deleted or extended scenes and ""The Making of Submarine"" (11 min), featuring interviews with the cast and director in which they discuss the characters, making the film, and working with one another.

6285238,5,B005IYF8C8,"SUBMARINE is not your typical coming-of-age movie.

It is filled with great warmth and wit, and takes a serious look at teen concerns without lapsing into a raunchy style of comedy found in so many movies of this genre.

Adapted by screenwriter-director Richard Ayoade from Joe Dunthorne's novel, the story tells of Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), a sensitive Welsh teenager who does not ""fit in"" with his fellow students.  He spends his time daydreaming about how people would react to his death, listening to recordings by French crooners and also plotting how to lose his virginity, preferably with the equally eccentric Jordana (Yasmin Paige), who likes to start fires.

Although he seems to hit a home run in his relationship with Jordana, Oliver does have some real world issues that he must confront.  His parents (Noah Taylor, Sally Hawkins) are not getting on well and, in fact, Oliver suspects that Mom is having an affair with the next-door neighbor (Paddy Considine), her old flame.  If that's not bad enough, Jordana's mother has a brain tumor and is facing surgery.

How the young man deals with these problems is what growing up is all about.

I was quite moved by this charming film.  The performances are exquisite, most of all Sally Hawkins, who is always a delight to watch, and young Roberts.  There may not be any laugh-out-loud moments, but it is quite funny.  SUBMARINE is well worth seeing.

DVD extras include a ""making of"" featurette and some deleted scenes.

I saw the milusic video and then found out that there was a movie and I was not disappointed. This certainly is a coming-of-age movie, but it isn't your typical coming-of-age movie.

I was also kinda half expecting it to be one of those ostentatious/french/new wave coming of age films, filled with references that went over my head. But if I had to describe this film in one word it honestly is : charming. Filled with quirky, hilarious dark humor (not a ""DEPRESSING DARK!""

As an adaptation, it keeps the emotion, narrative style, and dry comedy perfectly. The endings are different, but both are powerful. I don't mind the change because they both have different things to say. Both show that people can change after going through everyday sadness that is apart of growing up. The movie is just a bit more romantic and optimistic than the book, and that appeals to me. Both are great, and I recommend them both.

8644540,5,B005IYF8C8,"Submarine is Richard Ayoades 1st film, after having made short music-based videos. His style is clipped, laconic, the unemotional-seeming wide-eyed alertness of a new talent, who has taken to the adolescent musings of his main character Oliver (CraigRoberts), the deluded diarist, who thinks he can save his parents marriage and lose his virginity to Jordan (Yasmin Paige). In some ways it recalls Holden Caulfield or films like The Graduate. There is the use of voiceover and subjective filming. Based on the translation of an interior novel to objective film, the film seems fresh, narrated by Oliver Tate, we get an adolescents view of middle aged depression, marital discord, illness, and the ins and outs of dating etiquette. As in The Graduate with Simon & Garfunkel songs, playing where theres no speech, here we get songs by Alex Turner, celebrating young love, with sunsets shot in soft focus.

I got a feel of Wes Anderson too about the way he films the quirkiness of relationships and the adolescent view of the adult world. We seem to be in an analogue world where the school kids pass handwritten notes to each other in class. Oliver with his briefcase and duffel-coat has a distinctly nerdy air, whose main aim, outside of reading his dictionary is to get a girlfriend and lose his virginity. Oliver is a schemer, who wants to save his parents marriage, rescuing his mum Jill (Sally Hawkins) from the clutches of her ex-flame, spiritual guru Graham Purvis( Paddy Considine enjoying the role), and his dad, marine biologist Lloyd( Noah Taylor).Jordana is an emotion-hating pyromaniac, and is very much the centre of the films attention (or Olivers), she likes to burn her loved-ones leg hair.
