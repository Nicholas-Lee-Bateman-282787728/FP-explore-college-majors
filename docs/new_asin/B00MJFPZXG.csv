8684313,1,B00MJFPZXG,So disappointed! The seller didn't give detailed description of the product that the DVD is from different region and it has to be compatible with a EU DVD player. I purchased this DVD as present and I was embarrassed when we tried to play the DVD because it didn't play buy instead the screen shows wrong region.  Now we are spending unexpected expenses by buying a Universal DVD player so that we can watch it. So disappointing!,1485561600,2,430,4.584415584415584
