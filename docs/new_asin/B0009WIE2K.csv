2327378,5,B0009WIE2K,"I'm not into a lot of analysis and social commentary like many of the reviewers of this film seem to be. And I have nothing against the bourgeoisie--average middle class people make the world go round (and I bet that most people who review films on Amazon are very middle-class, enjoying the comforts of 21st century America--which are considerably more than the comforts of 1930's France.)  I can see that if there was a real Boudu, I would  not want him in my house for very long, if at all (the man spits in books!  He uses clean bed quilts to wipe his dirty feet!)  However, all social commentary aside, this is one of the funniest movies ever.  Michel Simon is a comic genius.  The physical things he does, the way he talks just continually crack you up--he would be funny in a moview by himself.  But it's even funnier here to watch him react with the other people in the movie, who are all really good actors and excellent straight men (and women).  If you just want to laugh and laugh, watch this.",1160524800,2,1005,4.423913043478261

2327382,5,B0009WIE2K,"The opening scenes of 'Boudu Saved from drowning'  contrast the urbane bookseller Lestingois with the hirsute titular tramp.  The former presides over a haven of super-civilisation on the banks of the Seine, surrounded by rare books, paintings, statues, the best that the best minds have thought and created.  he is using the skill absorbed from this culture, however, to beguile his impressionable mistress, the young maid Anne-Marie - in this case classical rhetoric not only disguising basic natural urges, but actually replacing them, Lestingois' appetite more evident that his capabilities.
Boudu, on the other hand, is first seen in a park, caressing his dog, singing snatches of song, linked to the natural and populist.  These two collide when Lestingois rescues a suicidal Boudu,  and invites him into his home, where he is soon smashing plates, smearing shoe polish over the satin and spiiting in rare Balzac novels.  The movement of the film seems to be towards the greater bourgeoisification of Boudu - new clothes, Samsonian hair cut, ennobling by money and marriage.  But the film actually revolves around sex.  The film starts with a Greek tableau of Pan chasing a nymph, cut to Lestingois and Anne-Marie.  Boudu begins replacing his benefactor, not by accumulating bourgeois habits, but by displaying the sexual prowess the self-styled Priapus Lestingois lacks (the latter has no children).
70 years on, 'Boudu' remains a shockingly funny comedy, provocatively hostile to the soul-stultifying deceptions, compromises and resignations of the bourgoisie.  If this makes the film sound aridly polemical, than you don't know Renoir - the slouchy, amused Lestingois is the most sympathetic character in the movie, cultured, tolerant, benevolent - his crime, if you like, it the bourgeois expectation that the rescued Boudu should be grateful and hence dependent.  Even the women reveal depths beyond the initial caricatures - Mme Lestingois is given a beautiful epiphany, lying dejected on her bed, suddenly awoken by street music, taken back somewhere we've no access to.  Concepts of death and rebirth, heaven and hell, destruction and continuity recur, filtered through the overarching metaphor of the river.
The film is a strange mixture of the antique and the modern.  The documentary-like aspects of the film, the real-location shooting of pre-war Paris, its parks, cafes, pageants, music, rivers, boats etc., are ironically the most 'dated', in the sense that they capture a world long since vanished.  The theatrical artificality of the film, by contrast, is the clue to its modernity - the division of the narrative into music-signalled acts; the farce-like plot; the complex composition of domestic and exterior space.  The film's motifs revolve around spectators looking at unfolding dramas, windows framing action and dividing characters from life.  There is a remarkable sequence in the park, where a plein-air location is turned into a vast, endless stage set, through which characters wander in and out.  Far from restricting the cinematic quality of the film, this theatricality liberates it, opening up the rigidity of the frame, of one viewpoint, intimating whole worlds beyond it.
These tensions - between civilisation and nature, high and popular culture, sympathy and satire, ancient and modern, documentary and theatre - result in one of Renoir's, and cinema's, greatest films.",1004659200,40,3410,5.391713747645951

8068237,5,B0009WIE2K,"This movie by Jean Renoir is a variation on the theme of the 'noble savage', here in the shoes of a tramp played superbly by a young Michel Simon.
The 'noble savage' is obviously totally unsuited for bourgeois life and certainly for monogamy. His sexual drive is not yet 'tamed'.
He is only comfortable in the open nature with his comrades, the animals, even if he survives merely through 'donations' by the bourgeois.
The 'noble savage' is also a 'good male', a theme dear to Jean Renoir. He treated it wonderfully in his short film `A Day in the Country' based on the story by Guy de Maupassant.
The movie is also an admirable evocation of the atmosphere of a city (Paris) and its crowds in the years before 1940 in Europe.
Masterfully directed (perfectly natural acting by its cast) this movie is a masterpiece of real French cinema.",1369440000,,836,4.617449664429531
8068238,5,B0009WIE2K,"100us Boudu sauv des eaux by Jean Renoir (1932, 87')'

Boudu Saved from Drowning (French: ""Boudu saved from the waters"") is a 1932 French film directed by Jean Renoir. Renoir wrote the film's screenplay, from the play by Ren Fauchois. The film stars Michel Simon as Boudu. Noted American critic Pauline Kael called it, 'not only a lovely fable about a bourgeois attempt to reform an early hippy...but a photographic record of an earlier France.'

Jean Renoir (1894-1979), French international cinaste, auteur and metteur en sc'ene, adored and praised during his lifetime and ever since by the most divergent groups, icon of the iconic Cahiers du Cinma. Michel Simon, famous French actor of Swiss extraction, anarchic monstre sacr, in an equally anarchic film about the non-domesticabilty of a tramp, and generally the limitations of personal freedom.

Good black and white copy. All praise deserved. Excellent entertainment.

8068239,1,B0009WIE2K,"There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes.",1234396800,4,601,4.844660194174757
8068240,5,B0009WIE2K,"I'm not a fan of comedic cinema (nothing against it as a genre or art form; I just don't have much of a funny bone).  But Renoir's ""Boudo Saved from Drowning"" (or ""...from the water"" in French) had me laughing at the richness of Michel Simon's portrayal of the crazily unconventonal tramp who disrupts a respectable bourgeois household.

Boudo is a comical Caliban, a wild ""Neanderthal"" as one of the film's characters calls him, who serves as a countervailing force to everything that the middle class calls ""civilization.""  He eats when he wants, sleeps where he wants, wears what he wants, he has no sense of property or propriety, and feels neither gratitude nor obligation when given a handout.  He's very much like an animal:  embodied, appetitive, and clueless about what's respectable and what's not.

But Boudu performs an important function in the film:  he reveals the pretensions and hypocrisy of so-called respectable middle class.  They sneak around in their adulterous affairs. Boudu's lust is open and unconcealed.  They sell their souls for money and prestige.  Boudu couldn't care less.  They mouth platitudes about helping their fellow man, but only if the fellow man they're helping is polite and clean and well-trained.  ""Boudu Saved from Drowning"" is a wonderful expose of the thinness of the veneer we call ""social propriety.""

Just three hilarious moments from the film:

Edouard Lestingois (Charles Granval), the bookseller who saves Boudu from the Seine and then embarks on a crusade to civilize him, washes his hands of his uncooth guest when he discovers that Boudu has spit in a copy of Balzac's The Physiology of Marriage.  ""I care less than nothing for someone who would desecrate this book!"" he exclaims.  ""One should only come to the aid of one's equals!""  Yet Lestingois, who seems so concerned about a book on marriage, has no qualms about cheating on his wife.

A little girl gives street tramp Boudu 5 francs.  Several moments later, an obviously wealthy dandy passing by fruitlessly searches his pockets for change to give Boudu.  Boudu gives him the 5 franc note, telling him to get himself something to eat.  The gesture is absolutely without guile or sarcasm, which is what makes it so hilarious.

Tramp Boudu loses his dog and asks a park cop for help finding him.  The cop shoos him away.  Moments later a well-dressed society woman comes running up to the same cop complaining that her 10,000 franc dog has disappeared.  Immediately a sizeable portion of the Paris constabulary are on the case.

In an interview with Simon and Renois included on the Criterion disk, the two men remember that the film was met with outrage when it was released in 1932, and theaters showing it were even closed down by the Paris authorites.  Apparently the film hit exactly the bourgeois nerve at which it was aimed.  It still does today.",1220400000,2,2864,4.898128898128898
8068241,3,B0009WIE2K,"This is a marveouls slice of film history, giving a very accurate representation of life in 1932 Paris, and also an artistic vision, as well as subthemes of Freudianism, as it began to permate the arts of the 1930s and 1940s.
  Boudu is reminiscent of Chaplain's little trap, but more realistic and fully realized, irritating, ignorant, aggrivating and entirely self centered.  He is the animal nature of man, and our Bourgeous gentleman who takes him in is the supposedly cultured man who is also selfish and blithe in his own ways.
  The two main female characters also represent the ""natural"" woman as opposed to the ""polished"" woman.  No one here is blameless.  This makes for marvelous complexity, if a loss of likability.
  There are traveling shots here within the confines of the apartment which are still influential - the delicious film AMELIE has set ups which echo many of the the set ups in this film.
  An important film for film history buffs, interesting for history buffs, probably much too predictable and slow for many modern film audiences.  It's strength is also it's weakness, the time the Director gives actors time to just ""be"" within an environment (and the correctly used hamminess of the lead actor).
  This was the basis of ""Down & Out in Beverly Hills,"" and translated well.  They even managed to keep the tone.  See that one if you're not interested in the historical context.
  Note how casting has changed.  None of these actors are beauties, even the one cast as a beauty.  That is so wonderful and refreshing - I wish we'd get back to that instead of everyone looking like a plastic mannequin",1194825600,4,1626,4.780575539568345
8068242,5,B0009WIE2K,"In BOUDU SAVED FROM DROWNING, Renoir's satire is never cruel.  He shows affection for all of his silly characters, and no one escapes a ribbing.

Boudu is pure id (imagine Walt Whitman on a three-day bender), but he has no real malice toward anyone. Lestingois, the good citizen who takes him in, is driven by a sincere but utterly self-serving sense of compassion. He thinks he can bring this wild animal into his house and groom and curry him until he personifies the bookseller's own generosity. And he believes he can do this without any noticeable disruption in his own carefully ordered universe. Result:  Boudu dutifully applies black polish to his shoes, then wipes off the excess with the aid of a white bedspread. At every turn, china shop meets bull. It's lovely.",1181260800,2,774,4.804511278195489
