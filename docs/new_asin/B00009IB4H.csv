The plot - what little there was of it, stems around a green jade pendant that everyone seems to be trying to get their hands on.  There was two in a set, but one was stolen years earlier by an unknown assailant.  This unknown assailant tries as well to get his hands on the second one to complete the matching set.  You've guessed it, he was the thief that stole the first one.  This story is hard to follow.  You have some trying to steal the pendant because of it's value and one because he needs it to complete the set.

While this movie had some pretty decent fighting scenes, it was kind of silly at times. The girl who fakes being blind originally had possession of the jade because she took it off the dead body of the previous owner (until someone pulled the bait and switch on her) has great kung fu skills. This was too hard to believe.  She ducked too many knives, spears and kicks to be a blind person. This flick was enough - I can't take a sequel!  The picture keeps dropping in certain spots - very distracting.

If you want a good laugh get this one.  While you're on the verge of passing out, you'll be thinking to yourself why you bought this one.",1140652800,,1316,4.283400809716599
