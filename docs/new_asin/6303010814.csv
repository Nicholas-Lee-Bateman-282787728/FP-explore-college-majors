Lee Marvin is  an excellent actor and I watch him in movies when I can.
They do not show this movie any more that I know of.",1389744000,,160,3.8484848484848486

7833887,3,6303010814,"I never saw the original which is considered a classic by today's standards. This film had one of my favorite actors, Rolf Saxon, and I was happy to purchase it from here but the tape was defective. Anyway, the film is average all around. Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine are pretty good in their roles.",1149465600,,301,4.490909090909091

7833889,1,6303010814,"After seeing the first rendition of the film, this sequel is most unfortunate. The first was canned in 1967 and this 1985 version is very disconcerting. The time from the first to the second mission was just a couple of months in 1944 but the players have all aged beyond their military retirement age. You don't make a sequel AFTER 18 years using the same principal actors portraying the same peronalities, and expect to be still within the bounds of credulity. This is a bad rehash of the first and was probabaly filmed to cash in on the ""cult"" popularity of the first that generated over time. Still, it was fun to see the aging Marvin, Borgnine and Jaeckel reprise their parts. It's a good thing Bronson had the good sense not to indulge in this one.",1033430400,6,754,4.510948905109489
