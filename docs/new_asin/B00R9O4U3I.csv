8694644,5,B00R9O4U3I,"While Mutta's younger brother Hibito prepares to head to the moon and become the first Japanese person to walk on it, Mutta is still taking the JAXA astronaut exam. He and 4 other candidates are sealed inside of a capsule to simulate the extremely close quarters of a spaceship. In addition to the friction caused by strangers living closely together, there are some odd things going on. Tensions mount as the team splits over discovering the identity of the culprit. But if they can't handle a few little unexplained mysteries, how could they handle the potential unpredictability of space?

I think that the sealed capsule section of the exam was my favorite. It is was just so fantastically practical and interesting! You can test a person's intelligence and capability all you want, but if they can't handle living in close quarters with others then they certainly aren't cut out to be sent into space.

I was surprised, and very pleased, so see this set being released so soon after the first one. When I saw the first set was 13 episodes I figured it was going to be a couple of years before the whole thing was released. But if they continue at the rate of every 2 months, then 99/13*2= about 15 months! I guess when you don't have to spend time dubbing you can turn things out a lot quicker :)",1426550400,2,1301,4.579399141630901
