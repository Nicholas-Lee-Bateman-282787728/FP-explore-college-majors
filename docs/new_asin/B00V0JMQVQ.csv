Additionally, I needed to buy a ""region free"" DVD player to enjoy it. Worth every penny.",1500508800,,255,4.224489795918367
8708917,5,B00V0JMQVQ,"After failing his university entrance exam, 18-year-old city boy Yuki Hirano (Shota Sometani) went out on a karaoke bar hopping and drinking spree. The next morning, blurry eyed and rudderless, he came upon a brochure recruiting forestry workers to work in remote Japan. Attracted to the girl on the cover (Masami Nagasawa), Yuki decided to join the one-year training program. He ended up in a village in the middle of nowhere, an awkward addition to the brotherhood of woodcutters.

The humor comes from Yuki's struggle to deal with the quirky characters in the village: a cluster of snot-dripping children who nicknamed him ""Leech,"" on account of his unfortunate encounter with leeches; a nail-tough Alpha male woodcutter who'd been assigned to be his landlord and mentor; and the brochure cover girl who turned out to be a jaded Tomboyish teacher.

As Yuki gradually fell in love with the god-like, mysterious landscape of rural Japan (the fog-covered woods of Mie Prefecture), we. the audience, also forged a similar bond with the characters and the setting.

Aside from comedy and romance, Wood Job! also shows the tight-knit rural Japanese community's deep respect for the towering 50- to 100-year-old ancient trees that exemplify Nature's dignity, the people's reliance on the surrounding and their devotion to it, and the rhythm of their days and their sacred rituals.

The characters speak with a certain regional accent -- Perhaps the Japanese equivalent of Southern twang -- which adds musicality to the dialogs. This Blu-ray edition has English subtitles, so you do not need to understand Japanese to enjoy it.",1495065600,,1622,5.179389312977099
