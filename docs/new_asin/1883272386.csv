7800845,1,1883272386,"This hour-long tape opens with five minutes of ads for the rest of the series and the appropriate websites (the producers don't expect you to settle for just one tape).  Then the speaker, going on the assumption you know all about standard trading, doles out rhetoric about his personal definition of the term ""day trading,"" and it's all downhill from there.  Yes, really.
After watching this tape with an extremely bored friend, I gave it to another friend who had been short-term trading and wanted to get into day trading.  She told me she'd found more real information at the tutorials of online brokerage sites, which are free, quick to read, and easily accessible to anyone.
Unless you simply want the visual and financial shock of finding a cheap, poorly labeled, boring, rhetorical tape lying in the middle of an oversized, beautifully covered box, don't waste your money or an hour of your time on this one.",990144000,3,916,4.821656050955414
