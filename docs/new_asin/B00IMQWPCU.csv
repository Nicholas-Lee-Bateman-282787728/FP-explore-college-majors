6281785,5,B00IMQWPCU,"Fast motorcycles and powerful patrol cars, helicopters and two way radios and Broderick Crawford's sharp mind with much experience in detecting criminal activities the criminal always gets caught.  The cars are late 1958 to early 1960s and they fun country roads after those they are pursuite  of.  They also work in small towns mostly Nevada and California. But the best thing is the criminal always gets caught.  They are 30 minute episodes.  If you like justice this is good fast and short.  I see this is Volume Two the same is true for all the Volumes.
The episodes are all based on true Highway Patrol experiences.",1426550400,,620,4.80188679245283

8643418,3,B00IMQWPCU,"As far as the quality of the B&W picture,  it is clear and crisp.  I have ordered the complete series on all but the first season.
I am very angry because, out of all the discs involved in all the series that I purchased,  there are several episodes missing.
Several discs has an episode missing every now and then.

The episode is listed on the case and the episode in not on the disc itself.  So far,  about 2-3 episodes are missing.  There may
be more missing,  I haven't watched enough yet to tell.  So beware when you buy these series,  you are likely to come up short
a few shows. The only reason for the 3 stars,  is because of the picture and sound quality.  Expect to lose a little on this item...",1510704000,,706,4.186567164179104
