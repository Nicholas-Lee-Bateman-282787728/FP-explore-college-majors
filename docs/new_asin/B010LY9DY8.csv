I was so sad I could not find season 2 on DVD but this DVD has 2 new episodes plus 3 from season 1. I would love for them to release season 2 on DVD but in the meantime this DVD is highly recommended.,1488240000,,299,3.838709677419355

8722605,5,B010LY9DY8,"We usually watch Pajanimals on Netflix, so this DVD was a welcome addition to the episodes that we usually see (only season 1). There were two ""new"" episodes on here for us, including the Halloween one which was our main reason for purchasing. It was worth the cost just for the Halloween episode in my opinion, but then we all love Halloween here :) Our toddler son has loved Pajanimals since he was just a few months old and over a year later they are still a favorite at our house. The bright colors, fun characters and songs quickly grab his attention and he loves to dance along with the characters. Fun stories with great messages that address a lot of common early childhood fears and emotions.",1444348800,,701,4.52755905511811
