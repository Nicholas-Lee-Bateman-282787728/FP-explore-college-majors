8743209,5,B018WQBN8Q,"This was a great DVD that had a mix of episodes from two different seasons. The episodes were fun and I really liked the messages of friendship, teamwork and more that were shown in these episodes. While this is not a full season, the mix of episodes was good and definitely worked! All-in-all this was a great DVD with fun episodes that will keep bringing you back for more!
