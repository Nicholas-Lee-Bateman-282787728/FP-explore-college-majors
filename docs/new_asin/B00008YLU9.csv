7988030,3,B00008YLU9,"Fans of Stallone's ""Rocky"" films will know what to expect with this film.  The only original thing about this movie is the boxers in this film are female.  There is the usual melodrama, tragedy, glory, and cheesy fights that you have all seen before.  Sophia-Adella Hernandez certainly fits the role well.  She's not a bad actress and certainly has the physique and muscle to be a boxer so she is believable.  I hate movies that use women who look like they walk on a runway rather than go to the gym to play the role of elite athletes.  Her main opponent is a really nasty, brutal, and cruel woman called ""The Terminator"".  Think of her as a female Mr. T.  The movie has been praised for its portrayal of hispanic characters in a realistic and positive light.  Belle's father is a policeman and helps children in trouble grow up to be responsible citizens instead of gang members.  He's a great guy.  This movie does definitely succeed on that level.  Its not a bad movie but don't expect much originality.",1334880000,,1007,4.564245810055866
7988031,3,B00008YLU9,"OK-- just know what you're getting here. You're NOT buying this for the acting, script or other Oscar categories.  You're buying this because it shows women beating each other up.  Not so much boxing as landing 19-20 unblocked punches to the opponent's head or gut; each punch -judging by the sound effect-- would drop an elephant. Each boxer does a creditable job of grimacing, suffering and sweating. Way too much ""plot"" gets in the way here, but on DVD you can pass up the grease and go right for the meat.",1054339200,2,509,4.582417582417582
7988032,1,B00008YLU9,"I rented Knockout thinking that it would be like Girlfight.  Girlfight was an amazing movie, with amazing acting.  Knockout is an insult to Girlfight by just having the same SUBJECT matter.  It was the worst movie I've ever seen with bad acting and a predictable ending.  It was a waste of money, and a waste of time.  Whatever you do, DON'T SEE KNOCKOUT!",977788800,,355,4.571428571428571
7988033,5,B00008YLU9,"To tell you the truth, My brother and I were not expecting a good movie...BUT We were both very surprised of how good and well done this film was made..the fight scenes were awesome...The story itself was very good  and very exciting...I'll admit it did bring tears to my eyes..The walk in  music they played for both fighters at the end of the movie was sad and  exciting..ALSO The Main actress herself was herself a TOTAL KNOCKOUT!Very  well worth the price for Video or DVD",959040000,8,476,4.564705882352941
