8560992,5,B00B1PT9FK,"This sequel to ROOM AT THE TOP stars Kenneth Haigh in the role made famous by Laurence Harvey. Haigh plays Joe Lampton quite differently from Harvey's version -- he's just as ambitious, but more ruthless, and very, very shrewd -- and funny. Nanette Newman and Harry Andrews give effective support.
