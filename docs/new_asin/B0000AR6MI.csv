7997842,5,B0000AR6MI,"if you're a woman bored with your routine at the gym or tired of hitting the pavement, this workout is for you. I was inspired after taking one of Amira's classes at Broadway Dance Center in NYC and decided to buy a few of her DVD's. The workout is hard! Belly dancing isn't easy! This DVD promises a total feminine body workout and delivers just that, it's amazing. It makes you feel sexy and beautiful while burning excess inches off your body. It really strengthens your core, legs, back, butt and arms while keeping your body curvy and giving you a more distinct hourglass shape. Amira has an essence about her which keeps the workout fun and enjoyable. Definitely worth a try. =)",1272153600,2,684,4.569105691056911
7997843,1,B0000AR6MI,"This is such a bad DVD, I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll start with the production value. If you had the cheapeast VHS camcorder available (no, not digital, VHS camcorder - those oldies out there LO ) & were to film yourself & friends in your garage, basement, or school or club gymnasium you would have the film quality of this DVD. It... is... TERRIBLE ! You can actually see a clip of this on youtube if you don't believe me. You can see gym go-ers in the windows in the background, sweating away on various gym equipment. The workout itself is not good. There is nothing here that will get your heartrate up. It just moves too slowly. If it were instructional I'd say the pace was ok, but it's not instructional. It's supposed to be a workout. Even if it WERE instructional, there just aren't that many different movements done in this to make it a good instructional DVD either. It is the most repetetive workout I've seen, and I've seen many. If it were meant to be drilling a movement, ok, I could see the repetition, but it's not that either. It's just plain bad. Overly repetetive (Even the gym go-ers who were watching through the windows eventually seem bored after a while & stop watching) , poor production quality, and the music isn't that great either, not that you could tell helf the time because the sound quality is so poor. The instructor ... good gawd, just skip anything she offers. She doesn't cue well, she doesn't explain the movements well to those who may just be starting out, and her own dance form isn't that great. She's just not a good instructor on DVD. There are far better instructors, & far better bellydance workouts available. Save the money & use it towards something better.",1227830400,2,1728,4.523961661341853
7997844,5,B0000AR6MI,"Let me start by telling you that the setting is in a Bally's gym and she is leading a Bellydance workout class.
With that being said, I love this video.  Amira is such a joy to watch for the workout and her perfomance.  She actually looks like she is enjoying herself.
It is such an encouragement to see that there are different ages (yes, there are kids here too) and body types here.  So you don't have to have a 24-inch waist to do this.  Amira even goes to some people in the class to show them the proper way to do the various exercises. If you want to see the  workout done right,you'd have to watch Amira herself.  If you look at the rest of the class you won't feel so bad because even with the little imperfections during the workout, you can tell that they are still having fun.
There is a section in the video where it says free style for a beautiful body, and in here you just dance for the sake of dancing and of course have fun while you're at it.",1205884800,,961,4.112299465240642
