A perfect picture of Ashton choreography.",1382313600,,155,5.5
8486227,5,B005THVW88,"I've watched it over and over.  Such delightful dancing and choreography, even if my mind doesn't always self-wipe afterwards.  Each time adds to the enjoyment.",1371772800,,160,5.36
8486228,5,B005THVW88,The expression of Ashton's choreography by the corp de ballet is very beautifully expressed on the stage.  Wonderful interpretations rendered!,1368230400,,142,6.1
8486229,5,B005THVW88,"This is a program to treasure.  Pure ballet.  Pure Ashton.

Les Partineurs takes us back to Edwardian England.  The choreography just makes the dancers look like they are literally ice skating.  Each scene is a ""picture"" from an evening of skating.  There are solos, small groups, large groups and all are seamlessly woven into a thoroughly enjoyable ballet.  The costumes are in keeping with the period and somewhat whimsical.

Divertissements is a grouping of unrelated pas de deux by some the most well known dancers of the Royal Ballet.  Some of the pieces are newer.  Some are older works.  The dancing is beautiful.  Personally, I could have done without the Isadora Duncan style piece, but that's just personal preference.

Scenes de Ballet is a Stravinsky piece and reminiscent of ballets from the Diaghilev era.  I'm not a Stravinsky fan, but it is an interesting piece.

Note:  When Divertissements ends, it appears that the video is over.  I completely missed Scenes de Ballet the first two times I watched the DVD.

As with all Opus Arte DVDs, this one comes with a descriptive booklet that gives the history of the pieces and commentary.  It has beautiful photos and is written in English, French and German.",1360713600,3,1221,4.897058823529412
8486230,3,B005THVW88,"I really think that they should have included much newer material, with new choreographies and young dancers of today.  There are so many exciting and new dancers and choreographers at the Royal Ballet right now, which you expect to watch in this DVD.  I enjoyed Les Patineurs and the Strauss Waltz, but the rest of it is dull, boring and even a little out of date already.  Tamara Rojo is interesting as Isadora.",1355788800,3,413,4.63013698630137
8486231,5,B005THVW88,"Frederick Ashton has claim to be my favourite choreographer and whose work unfailingly exudes style, charm, poise and humour to name but few of its attractions. All of these are clearly exhibited in this marvellous disc of choreographic confections.

Les Patineurs depicts various scenes set in an imaginary world of ice-skating. The music is by Meyerbeer arranged and orchestrated skilfully and wittily by Constant Lambert in 1937 and seemingly just as fresh today as it was then. The ballet remains a popular repertoire ballet with revivals most years. The key figure is the `Blue boy, who takes on the role of the `King of the Ice' demonstrating his superior skill at various moments throughout this 27 minute ballet. This role is expertly despatched on this occasion by Steven McRae whose star role is surrounded and enhanced by equally expert pairs and small groups of featured `skaters'.

This fun piece is followed by the 42 minute `Divertissements' which consists of 6 unrelated highlights from previous creations. It is invidious to single out particular pieces or dancers for special mention in such exalted company but for me the `Voices of Spring' pas de deux featuring Carlos Acosta at the height of his considerable powers with Leanne Benjamin must get a special mention. The complete highlight for me however, is the show-stopping performance by Tamara Rojo in an Isadora Duncan cameo where her acknowledgement of applause, still in role, is worth the price of the disc alone!

The final short 24 minute ballet, Scenes de Ballet with music by Stravinsky was reputably Ashton's own favourite ballet and one in which he felt he had achieved the nearest to `symmetrical geometric movements' which achieve their effect from any angle including that seen from the wings. (Information derived from sleeve notes). This is an abstract and modernistic ballet and as such fits the music. It is conceived in eleven short continuous sections and features groups of `four boys, eight girls and two soloists' (sleeve notes) all of whom perform to perfection on this occasion.

This disc, recorded in 2004 and 2010, features current and recent stars of the Royal Ballet all in sparkling form. The costuming is as stylish as the choreography and the music is performed as well as possible. The chosen repertoire is simply wonderful and performed to a very high standard and with evident enjoyment throughout. The camera work complements this balletic feast perfectly and the sound is presented in fine DTS surround or stereo formats. There is an engrossing 30 minute bonus in which we see three extended rehearsal extracts with explanations taken from Les Patineurs.

Sounds like fun!
So when will they bring out a Blu-Ray, or is it a long way from Hi-Def?? (U.K. review)

The usual trick Mr. Giles... bring out a DVD, have a good look at the sales, especially to dodo's like us who cant wait to see such stuff in any format, and then bring out the blu ray in all its glory so that our money becomes extinct and they rake in the eggs. I reviewed this too, and have referred to your review in mine, please read when you get the time.... (U.K. review)",1341619200,8,3263,4.998158379373849
8486232,5,B005THVW88,"Frederick Ashton is honored well in this ""Potpourri of Delights.""  I particularly liked Tamara Rojo in Five Grahms Waltzes (Divertissements).  Her dancing was liquid and dramatic, truly in the style of Isadora Duncan, I guess!  Never saw her dance in person!  The ""Voices of Spring"" with Leanne Benjamin and Carlos Acosta was also sepctacular.
  Actually the whole selection was brilliantly executed.  Thoroughly enjoyable.",1339372800,3,423,5.619047619047619
8486233,5,B005THVW88,"Good to see Ashton remembered. I always liked his ballets. Patineurs was always my favorite. This disc also has some seldom seen ballets like the Brahms waltzes.(I have it on betamax. the first and last time is was on TV) It doesnot hurt that the RB at the moment is loaded with talent, This disc jolns my other favorite ones. ( The RB disc of Coppelia is another.)",1329004800,15,365,4.382352941176471
8486234,4,B005THVW88,"The Royal Ballet's homage to Frederick Ashton is a DVD definitely worth owning, if not just for the stunning video of 'Les Patineurs' and 'Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan'. However, the rest of the DVD isn't as interesting.

'Les Patineurs', starring Steven McRae, with music by Giacomo Meyerbeer, is everything an ideal Ashton ballet should be: simple, elegant, technical, and full of nuances.
The story is a simple one, about 'the ice skaters', and all of their intricate and beautiful patterns. Paired with 'Les Patineurs' are three videos of the principal dancers and soloists in rehearsal, where they mope about the difficulty of the steps (something I wouldn't recommend watching).

The next ballet on the DVD is 'Divertissements', which is a collection of elegant pas de deux and solos. Unfortunately, the majority of them are in the same, melancholy mood, as pretty as they are. The Sleeping Beauty - Awakening Pas de Deux isn't very interesting, though the stars of the Royal Ballet, Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope, dance. The Devil's Holiday Pas de Deux is done beautifully, with beautiful lines by Laura Morera, though it's in the same, extremely lyrical and slightly dull state. The Devil's Holiday Variation is in this same semi-dull state, though with great masculinity and power, by Viacheslav Samodurov. The Thas Pas de Deux is also very lyrical, with gorgeous lines by Mara Galeazzi. Then comes Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan; stunning. With a piano onstage, and Tamara Rojo as Isadora, the performance is transformed into something unreal. Rojo shockingly turns into Duncan, and with every waltz to the music of Brahm, she shows a different aspect of Duncan's performances. Five Brahms Waltzes is yet another reason to own this DVD. Then comes the Voices of Spring Pas de Deux. On other dancers, this pas de deux looks beautiful, but here, with Leanne Benjamin and Carlos Acosta, it looks slightly clunky and heavy; although technically done well. The most important thing in this ballet is Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan, something no one is likely to forget.

The last ballet on the DVD is 'Scnes de Ballet', starring Miyako Yoshida and Ivan Putrov, to the music of Igor Stravinsky. The music here is beautiful, not the music of the typical Balanchine-Stravinsky collaborations, it is much more harmonious. Choreographically, the ballet is dull. It's just a showpiece, to see how many pirouettes can be done in synchronization, and how many double tours can be done by the same man in a row. Personally, I don't find these kinds of works interesting. Though the dancers are all stunning (especially Putrov), this is all like a dull, more colorful version of 'Etudes', but without the catchiness, spark, and (vague) story.

Though some of the works on this DVD are dull and over-lyrical, I recommend this DVD just for these exquisite recordings of 'Les Patineurs' and 'Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan'. These two works are unforgettable; and are worth owning to ballet fans, and especially fans of Ashton's choreographies.",1328745600,20,3125,5.050387596899225
