8371957,5,B002KGMDIO,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I only wish it had English subtitles.  Based on history after WWII, the story is compelling.  The script is excellent.  These French actors are superb!  One of the best dying scenes I've ever seen with Gerard Depardieu.",1452556800,,264,4.6521739130434785
