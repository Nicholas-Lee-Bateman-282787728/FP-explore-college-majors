8164356,1,B000LV6OIA,WOW. I can't believe this movie is so bad! Waste  time and money. I will see it Real Cheap.,1220054400,,91,3.789473684210526
8164357,5,B000LV6OIA,"The one star rating a person gave this is not fair. Obviusly the person was not a horror fan. Because this was direct to video. Also this was a Brain Damage film, there movies are usually terrible. At first I felt this was gonna be bad but then torched came on and wow just wow. Now that is hardcore horror. Gory and brutal I could not believe my eyes. And how anybody can say this is for the sick is dead wrong. This is a revenge flick and the people who get it deserve it. Overall if your a horror fan see this it is well worth it.",1203379200,2,533,3.9444444444444446
8164358,1,B000LV6OIA,"I bought this movie, watched this movie, and promptly threw it in the trash can.  And I consider myself a bit of a collector, so it is very rare for me to throw something away, even if it's kind of bad.  But this one is definitely in the throw away category.  I would not want it's existence tarnishing my collection.  Even if you are a fan of horror and gore, of which this film has it's share, there is no redeeming quality to this film of any kind.  It's clearly the work of a twisted mind; which perhaps may appeal to some.  But I've watched many a horror movie and this one does nothing to build any suspense, does nothing to tap into sensuality as many horror films do, does nothing to touch into your deepest inner most fears (at least none that I've ever had), it is just simply repulsive.

Bottom line, don't bother, there are plenty of other decent horror films around, both mainstream and indie.",1188777600,,906,4.357142857142857
