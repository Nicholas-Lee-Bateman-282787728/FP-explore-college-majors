2899797,5,B000TGVD1U,"Two Guys and a Girl is one of the funniest shows ever on television. I saw the original, and then caught it on WE a few years later and laughed out loud all over again.

Remember when Johnny ripped the popsicle off Berg's face?
Remember when Pete and Ashley had their brains switched by the mad scientist?
Remember when Johnny almost kissed Berg with a straight face?
Remember when Berg made Pete think he'd lost his finger in a taxi?
Remember when Ashley got her hand stuck in the garbage disposal?
Remember when Irene cursed them all on Halloween?
Remember when Berg's arms fell off?
Remember when Sharon woke up with a p**** bigger than Johnny's?

Omg, this show is hilarious.

Please bring this show to DVD!  I'll buy at least two copies.  Please!",1187568000,121,751,4.574626865671642

It was only 4 seasons long, which was already a crime; however, this show was one of the greatest sitcoms ever produced.

Nathan Fillion stars in Castle, Traylor Howard was the sidekick on Monk, and the gal who played Ashley, last I saw her, she was being murdered on Dexter.  It would be fun to watch them now on DVD if the powers-that-be WOULD GET A CLUE!

2899966,4,B000TGVD1U,"""Two Guys, a girl and a pizza place"" is one of those shows that just has something; like a person who isn't stunningly beautiful but has a certain spark that makes them attractive and interesting. It's not the funniest sitcom ever or the most polished, but it just has this charm that makes you love it. Unlike other shows, where the addition of new characters herald the winding down of the series, the inclusion of Johnny (played by Nathan Fillion, now seen as the lead on Castle and a fan favorite from Firefly) and Ashley (Suzanne Cryer) took the show to a new level of hilarity. You can't imagine the show without them. Many years after catching this show on reruns, my family and I will still pop up with quotes or say ""Remember when..."". It's been overdue for a collection on DVD for a long time, particularly seeing the success of one of their leads, Ryan Reynolds. I know I'm glad the wait is over and many fans will agree with me. A funny show that will have you thinking of the characters as your own goofy friends and remembering them with a smile and a giggle long after.",1286668800,4,1084,4.425
2899967,5,B000TGVD1U,"I first signed up to be notified about this release several years ago, when it was first made available.  I read at that time that it was a ""feeler,"" designed to test the response before making the effort to buy the complete rights to release the series.  Since then, there have been over 100 ""reviews"" of a box set that doesn't actually exist.  That's not counting the lazy people (e.g.: me) who signed up without writing a review.  I've heard the potential issue is the music rights, but how many responses does whomever posted this need before they realize that they will still make a profit if they release this set?  That's not even counting the people that will buy the set just because Ryan Reynolds is on the cover (I know they're out there).

This show is, hands down, on my top five ""Why the heck did they cancel it?"" list.

PS:  To those posters (2 so far) who are downgrading the star rating because the set hasn't been released yet, please stop.  On the off chance that the Powers-That-Be aren't reading the reviews, and are simply looking at the aggregate, it looks like there are people that, for some reason, care enough to post for a set that doesn't exist, but don't care enough to rate it the highest they can.",1285545600,,1229,4.475336322869955

- (sweet & kind) Irene's obsessive relationships with either Berg or Pete & their equally bizarre attempts at dating (Ashley, etc)';
- The whole ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" of the relationships that always went awry; & my all time favorite:
-  Irene's party & Robert Goulet.  Funnily enough, when Mr. Goulet died, I remembered his wonderful joyfulness and playfulness. What a great sport he was for doing that episode.

1. Everyone here will buy it and rates it at a 4 or a 5 out of 5.  IMDB has it at 8.2 out of 10.  The series was funny, witty and an all around entertaining show.
2. Ryan Reynolds has a cult following.  The man known for his sarcastic humor, recent romantic comedy roles, is easy on the eyes and is playing Deadpool and the Green Lantern.  From there you get disaffected college students and graduates, a significant portion of the 'I like romantic comedy' crowd, and comic book fans.

8209373,5,B000TGVD1U,This show was great when it was on tv.  I can't believe that it is not available on DVD.  Hopefully the studios will release it here.,1352419200,2,133,4.076923076923077
8209374,5,B000TGVD1U,One of the best shows on tv and they release it on DVD but only in the UK version...... Makes no sense what so ever!,1351555200,2,116,3.68
8209375,5,B000TGVD1U,How in the world is this show not available on dvd yet?? Especially since Ryan Reynolds has become such a big star. (which I predicted back when I watched this show) They've got so many shows that are far less decent then this one that is on dvd. This was a great show and needs to be released.,1350604800,2,294,4.086206896551724
