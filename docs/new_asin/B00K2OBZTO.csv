6401568,5,B00K2OBZTO,"I watched it in French and I don't even speak French and still it was spectacular!  Catherine Denevue IS Parisian class and beauty plus wit and glam; I FREAKING LOVE HER!!  Our whole family wants to move to Paris!  The movie is both funny and poignant!! I JUST WATCHED THIS WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES; IT IS INCREDIBLY HUMOROUS AND DEEPLY MOVING!  I cannot believe I am the only review so far.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DEEPLY EFFECTING MOVIE; CATHERINE DENEUVE IS MAGNIFICENT; SO IS THE GRANDSON, DAUGHTER, MOTHER, GRANDFATHER AND THE ENTIRE CAST!!  I have always been a mega fan of Catherine D. and have seen The Hunger endless times and this, too, I will watch many, many times over!!",1406678400,9,682,4.689075630252101

6401570,4,B00K2OBZTO,"I just got this DVD release from the Cohen Media Group though it was released in mid-2014. I see there are 30 reviews before mine so I'll try not to repeat what others have said.

I've been a huge Deneuve fan since I first saw ""Belle du Jour"" in which she was young, beautiful and sensuous. When this film was made in 2013 she was 69 years old and certainly had lost her figure but she was still beautiful. As this 113-minute French film begins she looks frumpy (that is on purpose) and running her own restaurant (which seems to have financial difficulties). All this changes when one night she leaves the restaurant to go find cigarettes and keeps driving. Soon the plot changes to her relationship with her estranged daughter and - more importantly - with the young grandson she never really new. And they go on a ""road trip"".  Yes, things are happening on the screen but Deneuve is never out of a scene. And you can't take your eyes off of her.

I don't know if other reviews have revealed this but MOST of the ""actors"" in the big scenes (especially in a bar and one where Deneuve - whose character was a former Miss Brittany in a beauty contest - attends a reunion) are not professional actors. They were local townsfolk who were recruited to play the roles.

You will learn the above in a 6-minute interview (in English) with Deneuve which is one of the three bonuses on the DVD. The others are 20+-minutes of deleted scenes (which I didn't find helped much) and the theatrical trailer.
Like other Cohen releases, there is an 8-page booklet with photos, chapter list and production credits. No essays.

The subtitles in English are in white but I found easy to read.

I'm glad I got to see this film. The story is okay, but Deneuve proves she is still an actress who you can't take your eyes away from.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6401572,4,B00K2OBZTO,"The beginning of this movie goes at a glacial pace. Needs some serious editing.  If you love Deneuve and can content yourself with the great ,not the greatest but good, scenery it is worth hanging in there.  All the actors are great.  Deneuve is the only one known to Americans.  All you aging Prom Queens are going to love this film.  After a certain age aren't we all aging Prom Queens !",1435363200,,389,4.347222222222222

6401576,4,B00K2OBZTO,"If you love Catherine Deneuve you will like the movie. I would call it  a ""chick flick"". it's a slow paced character study. Reading subtitles takes a bit away from watching, that's the way it goes. This film is for fans of French films, French scenery and Catherine Deneuve. Chain smoking and a bit of nudity. Sooo, French!",1424476800,,323,4.568965517241379
6401577,5,B00K2OBZTO,"Deneuve is a joy to watch. Great film!

And I'm glad the French always include family and friends dining al fresco in their films. I love it!",1419984000,,141,4.222222222222222
6401578,2,B00K2OBZTO,not a very good movie at all.  save your $$$,1417996800,,44,3.4
6401579,3,B00K2OBZTO,"Deneuve is still lovely and I enjoyed this film, except for the grandson.  He was annoying.",1417478400,,91,4.6875
6401580,4,B00K2OBZTO,"More than a tad sad, with a very unrealistic ending.  I enjoyed the movie, but it would not be one of my favorites that I would recommend, especially if you are older, when you can see yourself in this situation.  Catherine Deveuve was very brave to make the movie.",1417392000,,265,4.387755102040816
6401581,5,B00K2OBZTO,"The movie more than drives home the point that Deneuve's character has a life even beyond her ""young and pretty"" years. She herself is still beautiful and a wonderful actress in this movie! I kept thinking about ""Afterglow"" with Julie Christie (another gorgeous actress who can still WOW.) They're both sophisticated and extremely interesting to watch. Note: The boy actor playing Deneuve's grandchild is nails-on-a-chalkboard as far as I'm concerned.",1416873600,,451,5.457142857142857

6401585,3,B00K2OBZTO,Starts off okay. Then gets a little much with phone calls. I suppose I should have watched all of it.,1413158400,,101,4.1
6401586,2,B00K2OBZTO,"So disappointing. Too episodic, with little clear character motivation. The director spent too much time watching Deneuve drive alone and not enough time on character development. The script needs a lot of work.",1412380800,,211,5.424242424242424

6401588,4,B00K2OBZTO,"I was a preteen when I saw my first Catherine Deneuve film-- she was so exquisite. I love her realness- and willingness to show it, imperfections and all.  A very sweet story, not overly sugared with a happy ending-- my favorite!",1412121600,,229,4.585365853658536

6401590,4,B00K2OBZTO,"We screened this film at our non-profit film society (and paid the appropriate license fee), and the film was well received by a majority of viewers. It's a ""road trip"" film that affords the opportunity to see a once-sexy actress from the sixties demonstrate a search for something more substantial, beyond superficial beauty.  In the European style of filmmaking, it's also a rambling, episodic film that American viewers sometimes find disjointed and tedious. Like life itself, it doesn't tie everything up neatly, but realistically leaves some things unresolved.",1410134400,4,565,5.420454545454546

6401592,5,B00K2OBZTO,"The French have a way of making a movie that intrigues and tells the the truth at the same time. Makes one look at their own life. Loved the movie, bravo. Catherine Denenve is still a beautiful and accomplished actress.",1409961600,2,219,4.5

6401598,4,B00K2OBZTO,"I enjoyed this movie and Deneuve, as usual, is wonderful in the role as Bettie.  Although it could be a bit sporadic at times it shows a slice of how real life can be. The main thing I disliked about the movie was the actress Camille, who placed her daughter. She needs to stick with her singing career as she overacted and got on my very last nerve. I would recommend the movie. Of course, I am not opposed to subtitles as I have been a fan of foreign cinema for years.",1407024000,11,470,4.108695652173913

8655386,4,B00K2OBZTO,"I was pleased to see Catherine Deneuve on film, in such an unexpected story. It had a hard act to follow: The Last Metro.  It was an odd but good combination.

It's not a great film in the great film sense - no blast of horns will sound. - but it was entertaining.  It's  an offbeat  character driven: 'I need a smoke really badly' road movie about love and life. Life has been hard, there are some regrets and yet, still places to go. The character  is interesting enough to take me along for the ride.  .

Oddly, I'm not sure  Mme Deneuve could have done this film, the characterization when she was younger. But I am no expert, just an observer. It's the most relaxed I think I ever seen her appear. Here I see a warmth, humour and authenticity things I haven't seen in some of her great films. .",1493596800,,799,4.203947368421052
