3622021,1,B001GXR7A6,"This is a great series.  Unfortunately, these DVDs were deliberately encoded with bad sectors to prevent copying, which causes these DVDs to not work in a wide range of DVD players.  Save yourself a headache and get this series in another way that doesn't have copy protection.  Probably the region 2 (from amazon.co.uk) version of these DVDs is not encumbered by copy protection.",1235347200,13,380,5.0
3622022,5,B001GXR7A6,"I'm not Australian and have never been there. I stumbled upon this show by accident and watched all 8 episodes in two days. It's really hilarious and I love how in Australia touchy subjects and foul language aren't censored! It makes things much more real and true to life. I wish there were more episodes but it's more fitting for it to end the way it did. My favorite was Jonah Takalua and his friends, but Mr. G and Ja'mie were hilarious too! I didn't realize Ofa was a girl until episode 3!

This show makes me want to search for more Aussie shows and to visit Australia for vacation. I've heard HBO has picked this up, I'd recommend everyone give it a try. if you guys liked Ali G & Borat you will surely love this!",1234656000,12,720,4.255474452554744
3622023,5,B001GXR7A6,"My 22 year old daughter recommended this series, so I watched the first episode on HBO on demand.  Well, that was all it took to totally hook me in.  If you like shows such as Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Flight of The Concords, etc. you will love this!  Mr. G's character, in particular, is so over the top.  It is very addicting.",1233014400,3,334,4.338709677419355
3622024,5,B001GXR7A6,"I discovered Summer Heights High quite by accident. Someone else turned it on, and not really paying full attention for the first few moments I came to the realization that I was not being subjected to some sappy documentary about kids in school, but headed down the rabbit hole into an insane world dominated by Chris Lilley.

All I can say is that Chris Lily possesses the talents of every one of the Kids in the Hall, Monty Python and the first two seasons of SNL in his little finger. I watched eight episodes in rapid succession, and I'm still desperate for more, more, more!

Mr. Lilly -- wherever you are -- be aware that I am in awe of your talent!",1232323200,9,656,4.368852459016393
3622025,5,B001GXR7A6,"Really, really funny. Good writing/improv, great performances! Why have so few people heard of this????

It is an odd funny, but when they get it, they REALLY get it! There were even a few really touching moments... and then they get you again!

I had turn on subtitles and Google a few words sometimes because I do not know Australian slang (eg. Povo, Pashing, etc.)

Sadly, the musical numbers in Mr. G's show are better than a lot of musicals I have seen coming out of Broadway lately! At least they are catchy... I caught myself humming one of the songs in the shower the other day! But the show sequences are brilliant... one of the funniest things I have seen on TV in a long time was the dog in the grand finale.

Yes, it is mean... that is why it is funny. Like so many great comedy shows, from South Park to Saturday Night Live, they do not discriminate... EVERYONE gets made fun of. If you are too sensitive to appreciate this type of humor, just skip it.  I am gay (one of the big targets in the show), and I think it is hysterical!",1232064000,7,1043,4.274111675126903
3622026,5,B001GXR7A6,"Although I don't own the DVD (yet), I have seen every episode of this series, and I just want to say this guy is HILARIOUS.  A rare comedy gem anyone is lucky to come across.  You'll find yourself forgetting he's actually playing his three classic characters, and believing they actually exist.  I wouldn't be surprised if this guy became huge in the U.S. in the next few years.",1231200000,3,378,4.529411764705882
3622027,5,B001GXR7A6,"Chris Lilley has done it again. Summer Heights High is his best work yet. This series is about three characters(all played by Lilley) at a high school in Austraila(where the series is based). We meet Jonah, a 13 year old delinquent. Ja'mie, a snobby, downright awful girl who was transfered from a private school. My personal favourite is Mr. G, the drama teacher, whos ego is as large as Aussie itself. This one isn't really for the kids though. Most of the humour will go right over their heads (plus the swearing).

This series is refreshing and new. I'm so glad it FINALLY came to America.
If you cant wait, buy the Region 4 dvd. It will work on some American dvd players.",1227398400,,676,4.495934959349594

3622033,5,B001GXR7A6,"Chris Lilley is a a hilarious, smart and sadly underrated actor/comedian. Why this man is not a household name is beyond me. ""Summer Heights High"" is hilarious, unexpectedly moving and smart. Mr. Lilley plays three characters- Jaime-The vain popular girl with issues galore, Mr. G. the ultra dramatic music teacher, and Jonah, a trouble young student. just when you think he is going to tip into stereotype, he reigns it back in ad gives such dimension to these people. Also, acknowledgement must be given to the supporting cast, who bring deadpan seriousness and commitment to their characters to a whole knew level. How they don't crack up or get sucked into his way out their personalities is beyond me. You will not regret watching this show.",1444435200,6,746,4.928571428571429

3622035,5,B001GXR7A6,"Chris Lilley is really everything in comedy. The way he creates and explores characters is really bordering on, if not full out genius. By the end of the season, you will have an emotional connection to at least one of the characters and you'll really *feel* something when it's over. He has something of substance to communicate to viewers, and he is able to mix comedy with message so seamlessly, it's really impressive. Love this series.",1444003200,2,440,4.802631578947368

3622040,5,B001GXR7A6,"One of THE MOST BRILLIANT, HILARIOUS, MAGNIFICENTLY WRITTEN, MAGNIFICENTLY ACTED television comedies I've EVER had the absolute pleasure to view!  Chris Lilley is a freakin' GENIUS; he creates and performs three separate characters, ALL who are - for the most part - unlikable.  That's the genius...you think they may change, maybe they all change, but then they'll do something completely selfish/self-centered/horrible, and you're left laughing while not liking each one of them again...

This is pretty complex stuff for a comedy; there are a lot of underlying and serious themes under the show's surface, which bubble up occasionally to remind us that these three characters (and other supporting characters) are not evil - just mostly selfish, self-centered douchebags...who are HILARIOIUS!!!

The supporting cast is TREMENDOUS; the students must be primarily comprised of amateurs (if they're not, WOW - THEY NAILED IT!).  The adults, from the principal, to the English/composition teacher, the Mr. B's helper, to the ""bad kid's"" dad - PHENOMENAL.

This show made me laugh, think, reflect, howl, guffaw and deliciously enjoy Mr. Lilley's and the ENTIRE cast's brilliant acting performances.",1435104000,4,1196,5.543956043956044

In so doing they showcase the narcissism that is inherent in the maladjusted and needy personality of a few people MANY of us have met in our walk of life. The characters all ring true to me. Beyond hilarious.

Kudos to Mr. Lilley for the writing of course, but the depiction of the three characters are phenomenal. Each is different to the other and they all are believable.",1380240000,3,554,4.653061224489796

For fans of The Office, Parks and Recreation, and 30 Rock who find themselves getting the urge to succumb to catastrophes like The Big Bang Theory or How I Met Your Mother, this 8 episode mini series will buy you time before you decide which new series you want to commit to.",1369785600,,561,4.203703703703703

His Mr. G will be familiar as a slightly more sociopathic version of the narcissistic Drama teacher found all over the world -- men with exaggerated perceptions of their own strengths as performers and with little or no skill at teaching. His alpha female student Ja'mie is as painful as she is accurate, and is a lesson in the powerful charisma of the mean and selfish.

There is only one season, not because it wasn't popular enough to have more, but because that is how Chis Lilley (the creator, writer, and primary actor) wanted it. It is filmed in the documentary format, though is definitely tounge-in-cheek (what some people call a ""mockumentary""), similar to the show, ""The Office."" This particular show, however, is making fun of the different aspects of a typical Australian high school, as stated in the prologue of each episode. This is not a show of slapstick humor or funny one-liners. The humor mostly consists of poking fun at society. Some people will love the show, others will probably hate it.",1337904000,,690,4.905982905982906

Chris Lilley is an amazing talent, gifted beyond anything I have ever seen since the original Blazing Saddles 40 years ago, or Best in Show in more recent decades.

Ja'mie King is a goddess. She makes Regina George and Heather Chandler look like girl scouts.

Mr. G tops even Ja'mie when it comes to awfulness. It's fun to watch.

Jonah is the sympathetic character. He's hysterical, and his behavior is inexcusable, but you feel for him anyway. His story is the one with the most heart.

You'll likely watch the entire series in one go, and then proceed to show it to all of your friends. It'll become a favorite.",1331683200,2,635,4.592920353982301

3622128,5,B001GXR7A6,"Humor is too subjective to really provide a review, but I would never buy a DVD of a tv series without at least seeing an episode, so I'd recommend that.  It is in the mockumentary style, so if you like that, and have a sense of humor, give it a try.

Pros:
--Mr G.
--J'aime
--Jonah
--Australian accents

Cons:
--Would have liked some Australian of the Year clips on it, but I'm just saying that cause they haven't put that series on Region 1.

3622129,4,B001GXR7A6,"I work in the public education system in the UK and can relate to many of the issues documented in Summer Heights High. Chris Lilley's mockumentary is blindingly funny in his portrayal of three ghastly characters, who while being absurd and exaggerated for comic effect, do highlight many of the problems in schools these days.

Of the three main characters (all played by Lilley, a triumph of method acting and makeup), Ja'ime, the self centered private school girl drags a little in her constant bitchiness and selfishness, as does Mr 'G' the effeminate drama teacher who puts on a show dedicated largely to himself. But the masterpiece of the show, I think, is Jonah, the delinquent Tongan 13 year old who begins by being a classic school bully 'punking' year 7s, but becomes a fully rounded character. We encounter his abusive father, begin to understand some of his emotional difficulties and some sort of emerging sensitivity as he responds well to one teacher (the subtle remedial English teacher Ms Palmer) and hopelessly to others - including Mr Patterson, head of student welfare, who embarks on a number of initiatives such as the doomed 'Polynesian Pathways' programme, aimed at helping islander students to find some sort of cultural identity through dancing ('This makes me look like a homo', is Jonah's predictable response).

Summer Heights High is a fantastic comedy, but beneath lies a serious undercurrent of why society, and our public schools, are struggling to engage modern adolescents in learning.",1279670400,2,1521,5.104417670682731

Of the three main characters, Jonah Takalua is the most fleshed-out and original. A Tongan by birth, he struggles with his ethnicity, his illiteracy and his standing as a breakdancer. The Mr. G character is slightly deriviative of Christopher Guest's Corky St. Clair from ""Waiting for Guffman"" crossed with Ricky Gervais' David Brent. All in all, it's worth a look.",1260835200,,489,5.125

Chris Lilley does an amazing job of becoming each character that by the end of the first show I had forgotten that each of the three main characters was played by the same man. The humor is spot on and so quick that if you blinked you would miss it. The only downside to this show is that it was only one season long because Lilley only planned to do one years worth. This is an amazing show that puts most American shows to shame. It is intellectually humorous and will leave you singing by the end of the show.

It isn't funny in the slightest, and this guy can't even act very well: the three 'characters' are all just feebly disguised versions of him. Also, the portrayal of the drama teacher is pretty insulting to anyone who loves exciting students with the thrill of drama. The portrayal of the girl is also insulting to girls.

I did a little digging after laughing through all 8 episodes and see that Lilley's similar project ""We Can Be Heroes"" was picked up by ABC in 2005.  This guy is a pro and it shows in his work.  The show is clever, fresh, and absolutely hilarious.

Due to its originality, it's very hard to draw comparisons to Lilley's work - but I would say if you are a fan of Arrested Development, 30 Rock, and similar programs, you will find Summer Heights High to be well worth your time.",1240444800,4,660,4.377049180327869

3622146,5,B001GXR7A6,"High school is a fruitful, feisty and furtive time in our lives. It's something we endure, some thrive, others wither and die, setting a course of their lives. Chris Lilley, comedian, spreads his special take on this time through the ""mockumentary"" format of his show ""Summer Heights High"".

What impressed me most about his journey in this show is his creation of three absolutely complete and thorough characters. While they all somehow resemble each other, both in looks and in attitudes, they are extremely diverse, and there are times that you will love these people and hate them as well. His Mr. G, a flamboyant drama teacher who's ego cannot possibly fit in the staff room, puts on the musical of the year, about himself and a dead girl he never knew. Ja'Mie, a popular rich girl from a snobby school, spreads her charm (and lack of it) around the school with her gaggle of girls she's using to be in the popular crowd. And Jonah, a Polynesian student with a learning disability who's teased relentlessly for his race and struggles with culturally insensitive teachers.

Lilley's performance through the show is remarkable as he inhabits and lives in the skins of his people. While designed as a comedy, and certainly rife with many comedic moments, what struck me, as a teacher, was the serious issues he covers and uncovers in these eight all too short episodes. Most impressively, is the character of young Jonah, who never really has a chance to excel between his disability and his lack of adult protagonists in his life, save one teacher who loves him for who he is. That story touched me deeply, and as the series ended, it was his story that resonates. How many Jonahs have we lost in our schools for precisely the same reason?

Daring, risky, and occasionally on the edge between humor and inappropriateness, ""Summer Heights High"" is quite the show. I would love to see more.",1236297600,4,1892,4.762195121951219

If you haven't seen this series, do so! You will be laughing through every episode. Your only complaint will be that there were not more than eight episodes.",1235952000,2,415,5.1940298507462686

The DVD contains quite a bit of extra content; deleted scenes and bloopers that are well worth the price. If you enjoy any of Christopher Guest's films, the mockumentary style and the awkward characters, then you should definitely check out Summer Heights High. The show is brilliant comedy, but also has leanings towards being bittersweet....a tough combination to come by, but Chris Lilley hits just the right notes to mix the two into a brilliant 8 episode run.

Note: It is better to watch the episodes sequentially. You won't get the full effect of the last episode if you skip around. The finale is something to behold; especially Mr. G's finalized musical.",1235520000,2,825,4.6506849315068495

I did slightly enjoy the bully character, but not nearly enough to recommend sitting through all the non-humorous, discomfiting bits that fill up most of the running time.
Even though I disliked this show, I really appreciate the tangential choices that  HBO has been taking lately.
