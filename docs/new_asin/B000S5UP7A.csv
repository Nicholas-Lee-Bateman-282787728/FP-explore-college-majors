This movie has suffered some bad press.  That's sad.  Because it's a movie that has a lot of imagination, danger, twists, style, and ends with a forgein version of a Romeo and Juliet ending. What's not to like? Well, to be honest, the thing not to like is usually the ""quality"" of the film...which is reportedly horrible!  The bigger your television screen, the more blurred the lines are.  Watching this on a computer ""small screen"" like RealPlayer, etc., will make the lines crisp and the movie much more enjoyable.

I'd recommend this movie to all D'Onofrio fans, needless to say.

But, also, I recommend it to anyone on the verge of having to make a serious decision in regards to their life.  There's nothing quite like watching someone else take a daring risk to either urge us on, or make us pause for more sober thought.  And, yes, we are likely to feel that we're not really ""living"" life after watching this.  There might be some angst after watching this movie to get out there and do something a little more daring ourselves!  Myself, I welcomed the push!  We are sometimes so set on making life ""safe"" that we forget that we are also shutting out the adventure that makes life worth living.

To the D'Onofrio fans, yes, he dances.  D'Onofrio is at his ""bad boy"" best in this film.  It's worth the money just for the bragging rights to say you own it...because it is a ""rare film"" after all.",1222992000,6,1618,4.539792387543253

The sets and the costume design are what make the movie good.  Found a cheap source for this movie (bootleg), on an online site (it won't show up on google).",1194048000,6,327,4.078125
