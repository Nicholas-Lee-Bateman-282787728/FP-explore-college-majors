7920158,1,B00004CSAV,"Frankly I wanted to give this movie no stars whatsoever but that is not possible. This has to be one of the most awful films ever made. The main character overacts to the point of parody as the film lurches from scene to scene with a totally nonsensical plot. Whose idea was it to give a very bad actor a part where most of the action is running around uselessly. Truly a pathetic main character who does not know the first thing about acting. Magott Nireomand, the kid actor, is very accomplished at screaming. Indeed, if there was an Oscar for screaming this kid would get it. Not impressed at all. The main actor is just a big mess with no redeeming features whatsoever. This movie is a big dud. I decided to look at it after reading the previous good review. Did not hold up in reality.",1407628800,,790,4.344594594594595
7920159,4,B00004CSAV,"Part autobiographical and part allegorical, The Runner (Davandeh) is about an orphaned boy Amiro (Majid Niroumand) living alone in an abandoned boat in an unnamed Iranian seaside town. On the surface the film covers the familiar territory of childhood among the impoverished neighborhood, but what distinguishes Amir Naderis influential film from other similar-themed movies is the passion of the central character Amiro (probably the alter ego of the director), or his fierce passion for life. The Iranian film may be slow-moving for some viewers, but offers a rewarding experience with a life-affirming energy.

Amiro makes a living by collecting thrown-away bottles, selling cold water and shining shoes. The life is not easy, but the undaunted boy knows what he wants and is ready to fight to get it. For Amiro, to fight means to run, like running after a freight train, running after a customer who does not pay, or running to touch a light airplane he loves watching.

The concluding flame race sequence of the children trying to get a block of ice alone is worth seeing for its emotional intensity. The symbolical scene is not only visually stunning, but eloquently tells us that life is worth living.

Amir Naderis The Runner is the first Iranian film that gained international recognition after the countrys revolution. The film was made in 1985  two years before Abbas Kiarostamis Where Is the Friend's Home?  during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88). After making The Runner Amir Naderi left the country and has not come back since then. Will he ever make another film in Iran?",1361577600,,1582,5.045977011494253
