1074502,1,6305767866,"To say this movie was unsatisfying on every conceivable level would be unduly flattering for this collection of huge Hollywood explosions punctuated occasionally by bad dialogue.
Without wasting space and time  with too much synopsis, ""End of Days"" was a millennium-armageddon  action film featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger as self-loathing, drunken  security specialist Jericho Cane and Gabriel Byrne as the devil, come to  plant his seed in an unlucky young woman (Robin Tunney), thereby ending  life as we know it and, presumably, unleashing hell on earth. Byrne is  probably still trying to wash the stink of this movie off his hands and his  resume.
Between explosions, we piece together that Arnie blames himself  for the loss of his family--thus, the steady diet of booze and  self-torture. A few more explosions and we're well on our way to Cane's  fight for redemption (a knock-down, drag-out brawl with the devil, of  course).
Often, the ending of a movie is unable to maintain the same  level of excitement that the body of the film created, and is viewed as a  letdown. Not the case here, though! The ending of this film did not miss a  beat in being every bit as insipid as the rest.
Please, please--save  yourself! Do not let those of us who sat through this torture and told the  tale have wasted our time and scarred our intellects in vain. File your  nails, clean your bathtub, alphabetize your breakfast cereal... just don't  use two hours of your life on this movie.
I guess Arnie and company were  hoping we'd be so blinded by all the explosions that we couldn't see the  rest of the movie (or lack thereof)--no such luck. ""End of Days""  makes ""Highlander 2"" look like a modern classic.
If there is  any good to be found in this train-wreck of a movie, it should shine as a  bright beacon of hope for any aspiring screenwriter. If this ridiculous  work can make it as a heavily hyped big screen release, the sky is the  limit for all of us.

1075001,4,6305767866,"Released at the end of November, 1999, ""End of Days"" is about the devil (Gabriel Byrne) coming to earth to impregnate a chosen female (Robin Tunney) during the last hour of the second millennium to bring about the end of the world. The hope of humanity falls on an atheist ex-cop, Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzeneggar), and his partner (Kevin Pollak). Rod Steiger is also on hand as a no-nonsense Catholic priest.

""End of Days"" is a comic book action flick with horror/fantasy elements. It's not meant to be an accurate depiction of biblical eschatology. As such, it's useless to pick it apart on these grounds; just go with it and enjoy the ride. That said, there are some real-life subtexts and accurate biblical aspects. For instance, disillusionment due to the unjust death of a loved one (or any number of other tragedies) happens all the time.

The movie is R-rated not just for the violence and cussing, but because the filmmakers try to convey the devil's filthy lawlessness, like a threesome with a mother & daughter in a brief dream sequence (which may be ""reality,"" but it's hard to tell). Byrne has fun with the role of Satan.

As a holiday action blockbuster with Schwarzenegger ""End of Days"" delivers the requisite thrills where there's a massive explosion about every 12 minutes. These types of movies only work if the story and the characters pull you into their world and the film accomplishes this just enough. It's no where near as good as the first two Terminator flicks, but it's close to being on par with the third one. Of course, ""End of Days"" is its own animal due to the dark, religious subject matter. On that note, the palette the filmmakers use is fittingly dark. The entire film takes place at night, mostly in the urban labyrinths of New York City with additional sequences in Gothic churches, shadowy subterranean rooms and eerie woods.

The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in New York City and the Los Angeles area.

1075006,3,6305767866,"I really wanted to like this film but for greatest part of it I simply couldn't, as, even if it had potential, it was mostly wasted. If amazon allowed it, my rating for it would be 2,5 stars, somewhere between ""It is barely OK"" and ""I mostly didn't like it"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

As probably everybody knows, this film tells about Satan. Now, when they are well done, films which involve the Prince of Lies or one of his manifestations can be really great, like ""Omen"", ""The exorcist"", ""Rosemary's baby"", The ninth gate"", ""True Romance"", ""The devil and Daniel Webster"" and ""The night of the demon"" or at least honest, like ""The devil's avocate"", ""The imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" and ""Devil"" (the one from 2010).

However, when including such a powerful player in the game there is always the risk that things will go into an uncontrollable spin and land into ridiculous, embarassing, too weird or simply absurd (""Constantine"", which was an abomination, is possibly the best example). In this film too, sadly, all those four elements are frequently present.

This is a pity, because this film had potential and in fact its beginning is not bad, even if it borrows heavily from both ""Omen"" and ""Rosemary's baby"". Schwarzenegger's character, Jericho Cane (great name by the way) a former police officer devastated by loss to the point of declaring that he lost his faith (when in the same time believing strongly enough to claim being angry at God), is actually pretty interesting one, at least in the beginning of the film. His sidekick, Chicago (Kevin Pollack) is also pretty interesting and well done. There are also some good one liners, I must give that much to this film.

That being said, the negative elements are much more numerous and they couldn't be avoided, being simply build into scenario's DNA. Schwarzenegger is an action hero - and you simply can't fight Satan with a Glock handgun or a Heckler und Koch MP5 submachine gun (even if you add a 40 mm M203 mm grenade lancher). Also Satan is shown here as a total contradiction in terms - one second he is all powerful, the other one he is powerless and needs sidekicks to help him. The whole thing about some renegade clergymen running with knives after people and engaging in some black magic is ridiculous and the sexual aspect is also really embarassing (poor, poor Robin Tunney, what was she thinking when she accepted her role?). Let's not even talk about the role of CCH Pounder, a greatly talented and charismatic actress, who probably needed a shot of vodka before turning her scenes, to force herself to play her part...

There was some potential in the dialogs between Satan (Gabriel Byrne, who probably had the fun of his life palying this role) and Jerciho Cane and some of their exchanges are honest. The whole idea of how the all-powerful fallen angel can finally be bested by a mere mortal was also not half-bad. However, all the rest of Gabriel Byrne's screen time as Satan was wasted in quite ridiculous scenes.

For all those reasons, as I already said, I rate this film 2,5 stars. Great fan of ""Ahrnold"" even in his lesser movies, I don't regret that I bought and watched this film, but I will not keep it. Only for Schwarzenegger's greatest fans - all other people, well, watch it at your own risk.",1398729600,,3324,4.722413793103448

This is yet another end of civilization movie that has been done far,far better than this ponderous flicker. This thing has more twists,turns and detours than New York City on a good day.
The story finds us in 1979 and the Vatican/Pope is heralding the birth,somewhere in the world,of a baby that,when grownup,Satan will mate with and produce an offspring that will enable his reign over the Earth. Fast forward 20 years and the end of the millennium is approaching. Ahhnold and Pollack are two high profile security guards. Satan is roaming the Earth and chooses to inhabit Byrne's body. Out of coincidence Byrnes is a high profile banker who Ahhnold and Pollack's security firm is guarding. When Byrnes steps out of his car a shot rings out and Ahhnold takes the hit(with the help of his Kevlar vest).Byrnes is saved but Ahhnold and Pollock run down the shooter and capture him. Seems he is a renegade priest who knows of what Satan has in store and who Byrnes really is. Byrnes of course finds the priest and wastes him,carving a name in the priests chest. That clue leads Pollack and Ahhnold to Christine York,who is the now grown up baby of 20 years ago. The men save her from other renegade priests from the Vatican who want the girl dead. Later that night as Ahhnold is talking to Christine in her apartment,his pal Pollock gets wasted by Satan/Brynes outside. Ahhnold and Christine flee to a church where a father,played by Rod Steiger,welcomes them. Steiger tells them of the prophecy to come and Christine and Byrnes apparent roles. Ahhnold returns to his apartment where he confronts Satan. He tries to tempt Ahhnold but he is having none of it.
Back at the Church Ahhnold returns only to have the renegades from the Vatican show up wanting to kill Christine. However Satan/Byrnes interrupts and kills the renegades. Ahhnold and Christine flee only to be separated once more. One of Satan's servants captures Christine while Ahhnold is set upon and placed on a cross and left there. Next day priest Steiger comes out to take Ahhnold down. Ahhnold rearms himself and finds Satan's hideout. He rescues Christine and flees through a subway tunnel. In the ensuing chase Byrnes body is irreparably damaged and Satan looks for another host.
Ahhnold and Christine flee to another church and there the final confrontation takes place. Satan inhabits Ahhnolds body and tries to force Ahhnold to mate with Christine. However Ahhnold resists enough to impale himself on a religious statue. As the millennium rings out Satan is forced out of Ahhnold's body and is sent back to Hell,unable to have carried out his plan. The film ends as the police services arrive at the church and an unwary public are in Times Square celebrating the new year.
This is one long and twisted plot that just goes on and on and at about two hours,gets one clock watching for sure(NEVER a good sign).If the film had have been a little more straight forward it would have been alot better. I love the clues that Satan leaves on the chests of his victims in the beginning of the film. Why would Satan be so overt,would he not want to be secretive about what he had in mind,instead of drawing a road map?Whatever the case,the clues always lead our heroes straight to the next victim or person to be saved.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette,commentary,a look at special effects,the trailer,a look at the Book of Revelations and some DVD-ROM features.
All in all a disappointing Ahhnold entry. Too long and too twisty a plot make this,after the first 1/2 hour,a big yawn fest. 2 1/2-3 stars.",1382227200,,3834,4.828267477203648

END OF DAYS feels like a dumbed down version of ROSEMARY'S BABY or THE OMEN, an opportunistic attempt to cash-in on the turn of the century paranoia that tries to mask its failing script behind big names and explosive special effects. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a parody of his former self, having been given more of the worst one-liners of his entire career as he makes a fool of himself on-screen. It is ever-apparent that he is reading the role off of the page, making it impossible for the audience to invest in his character. Gabriel Byrne, on the other hand, gives an entertaining performance as the devil. He is cunning and manipulative, but playful at the same time, recalling Robert de Niro in ANGEL HEART. It is worth watching for his part, alone. Peter Hyams' over-budgeted action sequences turn what probably should have been an atmospheric thriller into a flashy light show with no character or mood to show for it. If anything, the title most accurately describes the shape of Arnold's career as we entered the 21st century.

2. We got to see a more vulnerable side of Arnold, that shows us
all that he is only human!

4. Gabriel Byurn was an excellent vessel for the devil and he played him
very well (seductive and scary at the same time)!
5. Robin Tunny was great!
6. The whole movie had a nice, dark, brooding mood to it!
7. The beast was well designed!
8. The soundtrack was awesome!
9. The DVD gave us great special features (music videos, audio commentaries,

What I didn't like:

1075126,3,6305767866,"I think that all Arnie fans agree that his glory days in film were the 1980's and very early 1990's.  He made kick ass movies like ""Conan the Barbarian"", the ""Terminator"" films, ""Predator"", and ""Total Recall"".  Then he started making lame family films and and mediocre action flicks.  Now here is a horror film made the Arnold way.  The story takes place in the last few days of 1999 and really amps up the turn-of-the-millineum tension to the nth degree.  Satan appears on Earth to join his bride in unholy matrimony.  Problem is she is not willing and terrified of becoming his wife.  If she does, then the gates of hell will be opened and all kinds of ugliness will ensue.  Its up to Arnie to save her and stop Satan from achieving his goal so the world can be saved.  Arnold plays a bit of an unusual character this time around because he is very much a broken and borderline suicidal man.  Gabriel Byrne is Satan and is the most fun to watch actor in the whole film.  The female lead is a somewhat cute actress whose character has no personality whatsoever.  Why would Satan marry such a wallflower?  There are some horrific and freaky scenes in the film. However, its an Arnold film so it gets all overblown and bombastic near the end.  Its not the best movie he ever made but its a far cry from ""Jingle All The Way"".",1333756800,,1323,4.390946502057613
1075127,2,6305767866,"No wonder Arnold got into politics.  By the time he was wrapping up his film career he was churning out one gobbler after another; END OF DAYS may be his worst of the bunch (and that's saying something; there was plenty of competition).  Released in 1999--at the height of the Y2K hysteria--this contrived and overdone clunker has the devil himself (a smirking Gabriel Byrne) taking human form to take his pre-selected bride (a confused Robin Tunney) and mate with her (between 11:00 p.m. and midnight on December 31st, of course) to spawn the antichrist.  As silly as all of the above is, we throw Schwarzenegger's contrived character into the mix (playing a booze-soaked body guard who, because of the brutal deaths of his wife and daughter, has lost his faith) to match cajones with Beezlebub as they play tug-of-war with the girl. . .and of course we all know who's going to win that mano y mano slugfest.

If only our computers really had crashed when 1999 turned into 2000.

When I wasn't rolling my eyes, or cringing, or laughing hysterically, several ""duh"" moments popped into my noggin as I watched.  For instance, once the spirit of the Dark Lord occupies Byrne's body, he has to actually look for his girlfriend.  Why? *Spoilers!*  He has no trouble finding the girl's shrink, and with all the omnipotent power he displays over the course of this wobbler why doesn't he just wave his evil hand and get it all done by Happy Hour?  Well, beyond the obvious had Lucifer actually done so we wouldn't have END OF DAYS the movie; so in retrospect it was an evil supernatural act.

You will cherish several humorous moments, including a pudgy Miriam Margolyes beating the hades out of Arnold; Byrne's very human form enduring gun shots, being flung from a window several stories down, being set on fire, run over by a subway--and walking away from all unscathed (I want that medical plan!); and a climactic sanctuary scene where the church gets thoroughly demolished (just try filing that insurance claim).  *Spoiler!*  Finally, Arnold cheats Beezlebub--who has possessed him as a last resort, of course--by hurling himself on a sword.  Thank heavens he did so; having endured END OF DAYS for two-plus hours, I was about to beat him to it.

I will probably take the coward's way out

Why then the two stars?
Because the action and effects were very
good and, in themselves, entertaining.
Some of the sets and cinematography
were very well done.

This is not a horror film even though
it is promoted as one.
It is never scary.
It is an Arny action flick,
which is not all bad.
I like most of them.
This one ultimately fails because it
tries unsuccessfully to be something else.

The plot was beyond stupid.
If one is to use a religion
and a human institution
that has existed for over 2000 years
as a player in a plot, not done often
enough considering its influence in
human affairs, one ought to at least
try to do so in a somewhat realistic
and credible way.
This film does not even attempt that.

Spoiler
**********************
One example is the ending.
Our hero, after having a religious
conversion experience before the
altar of God in a Catholic Church,
exerts his will to commit suicide
in the church to prevent his Satan-
possessed body from serving the
interests of it's new tenant.
This merits him, we are led to
believe, a place in God's kingdom
alongside his dead wife and daughter,
who appear to welcome him home.
There's a wee theological problem
with that.
Suicide or self-murder, according to
Christian morality,
is a sin, an objectively evil act,
never good or heroic.

I didn't realize that 666, the number of
the beast in Christian sacred scripture
is actually 999 upside down,
and that means the reign of Satan
will begin in the year 999.
No, wait a minute, there was also
supposed to be one in front of it,
so Mr. Horny guy will ascend in 1999.

No big deal, but why was the Pope speaking
Italian to the members of the hierarchy.
The language of the Church is Latin
and the Pope at the time of the film
was Polish.
Vatican City is just by Rome
and Rome is in Italy,
therefore...
Oh OK, I get it.

1075260,3,6305767866,"In short, this film is a cross between THE TERMINATOR, RAMBO, THE EXCORCIST and has a little ROSEMARY'S BABY thrown in just for fun.  Whether this is an ideal combination or not, of course, is up to the individual viewer.

Like most occult movies, this one follows the tried & true formula:  the Catholic church has a deep dark secret that it has held safe the past 2,000 years.  The secret has ominous overtones, and only they know how to save the world (or @ least try to?).

In this film, Arnie plays a character who is far more vulnerable than his usual ultra-masculine roles.  That in itself makes it an interesting role for him.  He is normally the strongest character in his movies, both physically and insofar as his overpowering screen presence.  Not so this time around.

Of course, part of the reason that Arnie is not so overpowering is that he has to duel with Satan.  While this is the impetus for some cute action scenes, one can't get away from the fact that going after Satan with machine guns and grenade launchers will always end up being just a wee bit corny.

On the occult side, there is some interesting religious symbolism, most notably  a serpent & an apple (think Genesis!).  They also dabble with the old ""speaking in tounges"" routine.  However, in the end the movie paints with a wide brush and basically tends to end up looking like they wanted to shovel in as much religious imagery as they could, including one that is a pun.

Robin Tunney is a capable actress as the poor iconic religious vixen who is caught in the middle of it all.  There is one scene, however, that I objected to.  She takes her shirt off on the way to the shower.  That is all fine & well, and I'd never be adverse to gratuitous nudity in any film.  Rather, the problem I have is that she is topless for about 1 second and it's from a distant, bad angle.  They obviously paid her more for this (they always pay extra for nudity).  Therefore, why not let us SEE her?  She has a smokin' body, and had they done this scene correctly I'd be higher on this movie!

Anyway, the botched nudity scene aside, this movie is a bit jumbled & convoluted.  It's not a bad movie, but I don't know too many people who would rank it as anything better than mediocre.  It may appeal to people who are fans of occult movies and people who are fans of actions flicks.  However, my gut feeling is that people who are big on occult movies will complain that it should have had more of the occult aspect in it (preferably in a context that is more straight-forward), while fans of action flicks would have preferred a movie with more action.

1075330,3,6305767866,"Not so much a horror film as an action thriller with horror icons, End of Days is yet another Lethal Weapon/Die Hard variation.  A buddy cop movie with the ultimate villain: Satan himself.

If that's not high-concept enough, here's another twist: the buddy cops (actually, buddy bodyguards) are assigned to protect a prominent Wall Street yuppie from assassins.  But unbeknownst to them, their charge is Satan in human form, and the assassins are a hit team from the Catholic Church.  So the bodyguard heroes are inadvertently defending Satan against holy assassins.

As an actioner, End of Days is paint-by-numbers excellent.  Nothing extraordinary, but replete with Hollywood's usual first-rate production values, inventive stunts, extravagant explosions, and breathless high-speed chases.  Thrilling while it lasts, forgettable when it's over.

The film does flirt with some appropriate supernatural horror themes.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is Jericho Cane (two Biblical names in one, neither clearly symbolic of anything; nor any reason for the spelling).  Cane was once a good cop.  Then he testified against the mob, and the mob killed his wife and daughter.  Cane did his duty, playing by the rules.  But where was the NYPD for Cane's family?  Where was God?

Unable to bear the guilt, Cane quit the NYPD and went private.  He's lost his Faith, in both the system and in God.  When we first see him, he's contemplating suicide.

Gabriel Byrne (a priest in Stigmata, also 1999) is Satan, made flesh to impregnate the unwilling Christine York (Robin Tunney, The Craft).  This must occur the hour before the Millennium, AD 2000, because ... well, just because.  Naturally, York will then give birth to the Antichrist.

(One film critic pointlessly sneered that Satan should know the Millennium wasn't until 2001.  I'm sure he did.  I'm sure the ENTIRE PLANET knew the Millennium wasn't until 2001, seeing as how EVERYONE was informing EVERYONE else of that irrelevant factoid throughout the latter half of 1999).

But although End of Days features horror icons and themes, its story is structured as an actioner.  When Cane realizes his employer is Satan, he turns his security skills to abducting and protecting York.  Still lacking faith (despite witnessing Satan's powers), Cane rejects assistance from the Catholic church, preferring to battle Satan with testosterone-charged gunplay.

Yet as one may expect, the Prince of Darkness is indestructible, even more so than the metallic terminator in T2: Judgment Day.  No matter how often Cane shoots, burns, and bloodies Satan, he'll be back.  It's lowbrow, comic book entertainment.  No cerebral horror.  Nothing atmospheric or profound or chilling.

See Satan punch a minion so hard, his fist exits the back of the man's skull!  See Satan hurtled down a subway car, knocking out poles like bowling pins!  See the subway car crash and collapse, the heroes racing down the car as it folds up accordion-like behind them!  See Arnold dangling from a helicopter as it speeds after an elderly priest/assassin, the priest plummeting several stories, crashing through a glass awning, then arising and racing down the street with Arnold in hot pursuit!

In both T2 and End of Days, Arnold protects a naif from an indestructible, relentless killer.  Imagine T2's terminator having a supernatural, rather than a scientific, rationale, and you'll get a flavor for End of Days.

Apart from his name, there's some religious symbolism when Satan crucifies Cane.  Here, Satan commits the silly mistake of many supervillains: allowing the hero to live so he may suffer a slow death, hear the villain's diabolical plans, and fully realize his defeat at the hands of the brilliant villain.  Of course, this allows Arnold a chance to escape...

End of Days resembles director Peter Hyams's previous horror film, The Relic (1997).  Fast-paced action, much gore, little atmosphere, style, or darkness.  Still, Hyams's characters have grown.  Arnold is a better actor than he's usually given credit for.  Cane is a standard buddy cop clich?, almost to the point of parody, yet Arnold infuses Cane with depth and sympathy.

However, the stand-out performance comes from Gabriel Byrne.  His role is written as pure evil, a Satan without doubts, ambiguity, or sympathy.  Yet Byrne's Satan projects nuances, while always maintaining an evil core.  His Satan is one- dimensional, yet deep.  That sounds contradictory, but it isn't.  His Satan's evil is remorseless, undeviating, and unhesitating.  Pure evil.  But an evil coated with superficial, yet brilliant, veneers.

Suitably dressed in hip yuppie black, Byrne's Satan exhibits casual cruelty to his loyal acolytes, a simmering vindictiveness, and a sense of frustrated entitlement over losing Heaven.  Sometimes cool, even playful, then lashing out with lethal savagery.  His warmth and sympathy are almost convincing as he tempts Cane with the return of his family.  Satan's arguments are reasonable, his mannerisms gentle.  Yet always, however vaguely, we perceive the evil and deceit beneath whatever veneer he wears.

A minor caveat.  As in many films, the Catholic Church turns out to harbor a secret Order.  In this case, a renegade faction of priests trained over the centuries to identify and halt the coming Antichrist.  Either by killing Satan's mortal form -- or by killing the innocent mother-to-be of the Antichrist (York).  Naturally, Arnold pulverizes these priests in his attempts to save York.

Now, I realize the Catholic Church has a near-monopoly on Antichrist films.  But I doubt all religions would have had their clergy brutalized with such flippant glee.  I'm not saying don't portray evil priests.  I just wish the nasty cinematic portrayals could be spread a little more evenly across all faiths.

It's difficult to judge End of Days because: What standards does one apply?  Do we measure it against actioners or horror?  It's a first-rate action film.  But as horror, it lacks the innovative style or thought-provoking profundity of Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, or Lost Souls.  Gabriel Byrne is a noteworthy Satan.  Arnold is a fine action hero.  His buddy, Kevin Pollak, is decent but forgettable.  Likewise, Robin Tunney.  Udo Kier has a briefly interesting role as a Satanic minion.

As a horror film, End of Days is adequate, but no more.  Its chief pleasures derive from its stunts and pyrotechnics.",1146960000,3,6415,5.225933202357564

Cast:  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Bryne, Robin Tunney, Kevin Pollak, C.C.H. Pounder, Derrick O'Connor, David Weisenberg, Rainer Judd, Miriam Margolyes, Udo Kier.

Running Time:  121 minutes

Rated R for intense violence and gore, a strong sex scene and language.

Hyped to the heavens when it first came out as Schwarzenegger's comeback movie, this 1999 film steers the Governor away from his attempts at comedy and collaborations with Danny Devito and back into the sort of action packed carnage that made his name in the first place. However, where the likes of Commando had him portraying invincible supermen with a neat array of guns and one liners to hand, ""End of Days"" is considerably darker.  Set in New York on the eve of Millennium, the film shows a version of the Austrian Oak previously never witnessed.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Jericho Cane, an alcoholic ex-Cop in charge of a security squad who finds himself embroiled in a battle to save a young girl (Robin Tunney) from being raped by the devil (a sadly, rather ineffective Gabriel Byrne) and bringing about Armageddon.  Cane himself is not the best sort of man for saving all creation either. He is mired in deep depression, has abandoned any faith in God he may have once had and when we first see him, is contemplating suicide. However, saving the girl gives him a drive and determination even when faced with some conflicting views from the Catholic Church about how best to go about this. All of this takes place in a very grim and gritty vision of New York where the rain never stops falling, urban decay is rife and pillars of steam rise from manhole covers. It is a fitting location for the end of all creation to begin and cast a dark veil over the flick.

Of course, that isn't to say the film is all doom and gloom as there are a few glimpses of just how seriously the makers weren't taking their project (the argument between Arnold and Kevin Pollack in the former's apartment is hilarious). Plus, while the story and characters are all developed to match the atmosphere of impending dread during the first hour and a half, the last twenty minutes are made up of the kind of explosive action that strangely doesn't jar against the grimmer nature of the rest of the film, though the CGI devil at the climax is pushing it a little.  As a photographer, Director Peter Hyams (fresh off his unacclaimed, yet deserving ""The Relic"") demonstrates actual ability, displaying some good frame work and movement, but it is nothing above solid work.  Screenwriter Andrew Marlowe is the film's greatest enemy. At parts, the script actually shows the makings of good religious thriller, and at times it even shows some quasi-intellectual thought (the Temptation scene between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these small pluses are choked out by a river of negatives. Generic dialogue/characters, gapping plot holes, and convenient plot points that just happen to point all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard Hollywood black holes Marlowe's screenplay falls into. The shadow of the good movie it could have been faded very quickly.

The film surprisingly has a good cast. Arnold, still possessing that larger than life attitude, tries to play a depressed, on the edge cop with no more than average results. Stick to be the invincible hero Arnie, it's what your good at. Gabriel Byrne is the strong point of the ensemble, bringing a nice air of cynicism to the role of Satan. In a villainous role ripe for overacting, Byrne restrains himself and it adds a bit more menace to the character. Kevin Pollak, as normal, is able to bring at least a few chuckles to the movie, but he's done better. Also look for a stellar small role from Rod Steiger.  Hyams looked like he was trying to separate this from the faceless mass of Hollywood action films. He was heading in the right direction, but had neither the script or originality to take it there; nonetheless, ""End of Days"" is a suitable venture if you are looking for an action-packed, special effects romp and a devil of a good time.",1135987200,2,4108,4.790664780763791

The special effects are good, especially the church scene at the end of the movie.

Crucifixions abound and there is no shortage of blood splattered scenes for the more horror minded.

There are absolutely no subplots involving any characters other than Arnie.  Arnie's friensdhip with his co-worker is tokenistic and somewhat cliche.

It could have been a very good film but ends up being a good ""b"" grade film - not the the huge comeback ""A"" grade block buster it was designed to be.",1134259200,,714,4.619047619047619
1075333,4,6305767866,"This isn't a difficult film to get your head around.  Take Rosemary's Baby, update it for the end of the Millenium, give it a lot of noirish atmospherics and you have the basic premise -- A young woman, Christine York (played by Robin Tunney), is marked at birth as Satan's bride.  At the end of the millennium he is to impregnate her, and the child will bring about the beginning of the end.  As 1999 draws near Satan (Gabriel Byrne) walks the streets of New York trying to give folks a very unhappy New Year, while Jericho Cane (Arnold Swarzenegger) races time trying first to figure out what is happening and then to keep Christine's virtue intact.

Surprisingly enough, what keeps this film from going down is a wave of dj vu schlock is Schwarzenegger's performance.  Jericho Cane is not a heroic figure.  He is an alcoholic freelance security specialist whose loss of daughter and wife a few years back has driven him right to the edge of suicide.  Bitter, rejecting religion, and more than a little bewildered, he is the antithesis of the typical Arnold hero, and Schwarzenegger pulls him off perfectly for most of the film.  Robin Tunney holds her own as the film's premier victim.

Unfortunately, the part written for Gabriel Byrne is a hokey display of infantile diabolic nastiness.  Random acts of cruelty are all the character is allowed, giving Byrne very little to work with.  Had Satan been been a more fearful character the film would have been that much stronger.  In addition, bad writing and directing marred the ending as well turning what could have been a great moment of catharsis into something cheap and predictable.

1075336,4,6305767866,"I have watched this movie, ""End of Days"", twice now, the first time I didn't like it due to the fact that I am a Christian and approached this movie as if it should be Biblically and Theologically accurate.  Of course, this movie is far from that and due to my mind set I didn't like it.  Though I didn't care for it the first time I did like some elements to the movie and thought some things were done nicely and Arnold's journey of finding his faith in the film is a nice touch.  When I decided to go back and rewatch this film I approached it as a normal film with religious overtones and viewed it like I viewed the 'Prophecy' films or ""Constantine"", which is it's not Biblically accurate but it does get some stuff right and is still entertaining.

Once I got past that problem it was an enjoyable film, I know it's received some bad reviews but I thought it was well done for what it was trying to convey.  The basic premise of the film is that in the book of Revelation in the Bible, Satan will have been bound for 1000 years and would then be released, now the writer has interpreted this to mean that Satan had been bound for the last 1000 years and that in 1999 he would return to earth.  However, this is where things go away from the Bible, Satan comes back to look for a bride who will bear his child, The Antichrist, and kick start Armageddon.

Arnold's character is interesting for him to play because he's always the action hero, whereas in this film he's playing more of a dramatic role and actually is forced to act and does so convincingly.  His character, Jericho, is a former cop and believer in God, whose wife and daughter were murdered and now he's a suicidal alcoholic who works for a major security firm.  His newest client just happens to be the man Satan has picked to embody for his new quest on earth.  Satan is played by Gabriel Byrne, and he is definitely enjoying himself in this one, unlike his toned down and slightly bored looking performance in ""Stigmata"" (the other religious thriller he starred in this year).

The supporting cast is also great, Robin Tunney was perfect as Satan's would be bride.  Kevin Pollack played Arnold's partner at the security firm and provided some very timely comic relief and Rod Steiger as a priest was nicely played.

As I said the movie is not Biblically accurate by any means, but if you don't approach it as such, it is enjoyable.  If you're a fan of the 'Prophecy' films, ""The Devil's Advocate"", or ""Constantine"" then you will enjoy this film.

This movie was watched by me 2 times when it came on tv
and I now have it on dvd
the extras on the disc are astounding too

see this movie
it will creep you out more then you can imagine

1075459,5,6305767866,"Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Jericho Cane, a burned-out ex-cop with the world on his shoulders -- literally! Satan has taken over the body of a Wall Street banker (Gabriel Byrne) and has one goal in mind: mating with an innocent woman (Robin Tunney) before the end of the millennium (thus setting off Armageddon). Can Arnold save her -- and the world -- in time?",1099180800,2,364,4.703125
1075460,2,6305767866,"There is very little of redeeming value in this movie. The plot-line, a translation of the book of Revelations so loose its laughable, is made even more unbearable by clunky and melodramatic dialogue. Although Arnold Schwarzenegger does some of the best character work in his career here, it is muddled by lopsided drama and action which just plain isn't. The pace of the show, despite the multiple and gratuitous violence, still never surpasses a struggling limp, and the movie is forced to rely on stunning special effects (I'll admit, they're good) and some big names (Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollack) to boost viewership. Byrne's performance as Satan seems phoned-in, and the spiritual struggle of Arnold--which could have saved the show, were it better written--is lost in a deluge of dramatic explosions, dopey double-crosses, and flammable demon pee, only to be revived at the last moment in a sort of ""oops, almost forgot"" by the directors, writers, and, unfortunately, Arnold himself.",1091491200,3,993,5.2125
1075461,4,6305767866,"Typical Arnie fans will probably love this. He lays his same sort of character, but he seems a bit more edgy in this film and he's lost his sense-of-humour, like he usually has in his other films. But this isn't a bad film. It's all about Satan himself coming to New York, seeking a paticular woman who he wants her to be the mothyer anerchist. Arnie plays an ex-cop, he has lost his wife and daughter and is ready to kill himself. But he soon gets stuck when he has to protect the girl. Let's get one thing straight, this isn't a film were you see a big red monster (Satan) walking around the streets of New York. Satan takes a normal guy's (Gabriel Burn) body and uses that body to walk around.
The film can be very sick at points, and I wouldn't let any light-hearted people watch it. You see sick things like a snake getting cut open, a man being set on fire etc etc. The film does have some odd but very good special effects, you see Satan as he usually is at the end, but it may dissapoint you 'cause he isn't in it for long. The film can be a bit suspenseful at times and can keep you guessing. It isn't all scary, but it might give you a couple of jumps maybe.
I don't have anything else to say really, apart from: Arnie fans will love, see it if want any horror film. Oh, and the flashback scene with his wife and daughter is BRILLIANT!",1086739200,,1345,4.137404580152672
1075462,4,6305767866,"Until recently I was unaware that this particular film was billed as Arnold Schwarzenegger's comeback film in 1999 after having heart surgery the year prior.  As a comeback film I would have to say that this particular film wasn't a completely triumphant one for everybody's favorite super action film star.  I remember walking out of the theater when this one was released thinking that Arnold really should've given this one further thought before taking the role and until only quite recently made the decision to purchase the DVD.  As I find myself doing often, I felt that this film deserved a second look and in part, I'm glad I did.  I wouldn't go so far as many others have in saying that this is a horrible, highly predictable film, but I would say that, upon watching it a second time, the film does have some good merits in showing Arnold's acting skills despite the poorly scripted plot.  Ultimately, this is one of those fair to midland type films that most could take or leave although it does have some very interesting plot aspects insomuch as to the whole ""End of Days"" aspect and the play upon Catholicism and the anti-Christ.
Performance wise, Arnold Schwarzenegger is at his best in films of this type where his strengths are displayed at their best to include the actions scenes and his myriad of one liners that continue to bring about a chuckle.  The one true oddity of the film for him is that he takes a beating in this film like no other but hey, what can one expect when Hollywood's crowned king of action films is up against the devil himself.  Gabrielle Byrne gives an impressive performance in this film, in a role that is just a few notches up of his normal roles.  This is the only film that I've ever watched that had Robin Tunney in it and I would have to say that she's a fairly capable actress but unfortunately not one that stands out.
Director Peter Hyams who is probably best known for some of Hollywood's best marginal films such as ""The Presidio,"" ""Outland"" and ""2010"" does a fairly respectable job with the film considering the script available to him.
The Premise:
Here is where the film takes much of its beatings as Schwarzenegger plays Jericho, a former cop turned body guard who has lost his wife and child to criminals and now finds solace in the bottle; a theme that has been done more or less to death in a great many films in this genre.  Discounting that particularly overly done theme, the film is based upon the ""End of Days"" theme, just before the dawn of the millennium in which twenty years prior a girl is born with the mark of the devil and those who follow the devil take up important positions in this girl's life.  Coming back to 1999, the devil himself shows up and in order to get his wish of domination, he must mate with this woman, Christine York (Robin Tunney) between 11 pm and 12 am on New Year's Eve...
What follows from there is a movie that is at times over clichd but does have some well played action sequences and a somewhat intriguing plot that does create a level of intensity towards the films somewhat ""comic"" conclusion...
Overall, I'd recommend this film to fans of Arnold's and those who like somewhat good action flicks that have a half way decent script.  {ssintrepid}

1075463,1,6305767866,"This was initially planned by the first screenwriter as a tongue-in-cheek Prize Fight: Arnold VS Satan, Arnie telling his opponent to go straight to Hell. He didn't exactly know how this hilarious format would develop but had a go on Arnold, who liked the idea. Unfortunately someone got involved taking it way too serious. It could have been great fun, but ended up being the most embarrasing of Schwarzenegger's movies, making Kindergarden Cop seem almost academic in comparison. It's also a very dark movie, even the forced one-liners contain no comic relief whatsoever, only raw cynicism.
A lot of wasted effort has gone into this one. Gabriel Byrne has the perfect face for the role of Satan, but acts as if he's bored to death, which is understandable. The screenwriter and the director haven't the faintest idea of what christian theology is about, although I'm sure a lot of illiterates brainwashed by Sunday school will think otherwise. In the New Testament the ""End of Days"" is of course God's design, not Satan's, he's actually trying to prevent it by tempting Christ to abandon his destiny. It's Hollywood, sure, but does that make it okay, that we are led to believe that theology is gum wraper?
The only good scene in the movie is three seconds long: Satan reveals his true majesty as a growing shadow on a wall, spreading his butterfly wings over a church altar. It's a very impressive sequence, quoting Fantasia, but when we get a good look at him it's pure Nintendo.
Schwarzenegger apparently enjoys acting as a Vicarius Christi in this ambitious piece of hokum and actually seems quite devoted to his character, but the pompous seriousness of the whole affair is really what makes it so unbearable.",1077926400,5,1716,4.88013698630137
1075464,4,6305767866,"End of Days was apparently Arnold Schwarzneggar's ""come-back"" movie, after his heart surgery. And no doubt, after he's done with being mayor of California or whatever he is, he'll have another ""come-back"" movie - maybe a Terminator 4?
Arnold Schwarzneggar plays an alcoholic ex-cop, who lost his wife and child and has been hitting the bottle ever since. This movie is partly based on the Book of Revelations, from the Bible, which of course we have all read. To refresh all our memories, at the end of the millennium, Satan will come and impregnate a young women, and bring about the ""end of days"" - which just so happens to be the title.  There's a lot of religious clap-trap in this, which makes me think of Stigmata (which funnily enough, also has Gabriel Byrne in it), and also has a lot of shock effects, and is as pumped up as Arnie. The whole movie is slightly over the top, and has been described as being The Omen on steroids. Of course. Having never seen it, I can't comment.
However, there is a bit of every film thrown in here. It's extremely similar to The Exorcist, Stigmata (you see bit-part characters undergoing receiving the various stigmatas), and I had some very extreme dj vu, when it came to a scene featuring a train - totally stolen from Speed.
I was looking forward to seeing Robin Tunney in this, as I thought she was terrific in The Craft. I got a shock when I saw her, as she has drastically changed in three years, between making The Craft, and co-starring alongside Arnie. In The Craft, she was young, pretty and blonde. In End of Days, she's now has a brunette elfin crop. She's instantly recognisable, as she's still got a certain flawless beauty about her, which will make most guys drool, and every girl feel jealous, and desperately try to see some little imperfection. Believe me I was looking - couldn't see even a small blemish.
As said by Robin in the extras, you just need to mention the name Gabriel Byrne to any women, and they will blush and go all girly. I didn't blush thank you very much, but he does have a certain je ne sais quoi (love that phrase) about him. He seems very charming, but frankly, for me, it's the accent. Which unfortunately, you don't get to hear actually in the film, as it's well and truly not there, but in the extras, he speaks in his natural `Orish' accent and had me going quietly mad. I love Irish accents anyway, so it doesn't matter who it is! Unusually, he plays the bad guy in this, as Satan takes over his body, and he goes after Robin.
This is your typical Arnie movie. He gets to show off his pumped-up body to the max, and gets to protect the little heroine. It's quite funny to watch, and see Arnie, all muscles, and then there's petite Robin, who seems all skin and bone.
If you watch through the credits, you will see how much entourage Arnie has - for heavens sake, he has a costumer, a dialogue coach (why?!), personal security, all the hair and make up people, plus god knows what else.
I was quite impressed to see Stan Winston was also involved in this, but to be honest, he doesn't really have much to do until the grand finale - but it's worth waiting for, cos he goes all out. It's not like the Terminator movies, where you see one of his creations every few scenes.
The extras are pretty basic. You've got an overly long - except it's only just over 20 minutes - spotlight on location; 9 special effects clips; an advertisement for the soundtrack (which features Eminem?!), and two never before seen, very rare videos, which frankly, shouldn't have seen the light of day they were that bad. (""Everlast"" music video, and ""Superbeast"" by Rob Zombie - as soon as I saw him, I put it off!) The ""Everlast"" music video wasn't so bad; it showed a lot of the scenes from the film. You also get a very strange theatrical trailer - it doesn't really tell you a lot about the film, just a lot of strange flashes from the film, and then boom, you're left wanting more.
Having read a couple of reviews about this, after watching the movie (one particular one says you'll want to gouge your eyes out after viewing this movie), I won't be surprised if I get told that I have no taste in movies, and this film was rubbish etc etc. Big wow. I like bad movies, alright? I thought this movie was reasonably good, complete with a fairly freaky plot. Hey, you never know, it could happen. But then by babbling about Satan, I will get sucked into all this religious stuff, and I'll regret it. So lets just say Gabriel Byrne makes a nice Satan! I wouldn't say no.",1076284800,,4534,4.429940119760479

It's like ""Freddy vs. Jason"" but with two of the biggest bad-asses with the badess reputation. I mean Freddy is the kind of nightmares and Jason is the bad zombie from hell but Arnie... and Satan thats a good match-up. Unfortunately 'Freddy vs. Jason"" Was alot better with graphics and how it was filmed, this movie wasn't as good in those subjects but it's plot was alot better, a little old but better.
Arnie is a alcholic cop, his name is Jericho and he is supposed to protect this stock broker, as a body guard. Little does he and his cop buddy Chicago (Kevin Pollack) know that the stock broker is actually Satan. When a priest tries to murder him. Arnie and Kevin Pollack are on the case like that. So he finds out that Satan is on earth to cause the armegeddon of the world aka End of days. So Arnie has to stop satan from impregenating this chick that will carry his son. The Anti-Christ.

It includes a great cast and the DVD extra features aren't that bad either. (I absolutely love the trailer.) The Devils playground feature is very interesting.
End of Days is about a Cop thats down for the count and has lost faith in god (Schwarzenegger)When his partner and him get assigned to protect a stock broker (I think) all hell breaks  lose, a priest trys to assasinate the broker. Well Ar-nuld starts to investigate condsidering that he took a shot in the vest during the shoot out. So as Arnold gets deeper and deeper into the case disturbing events and creepy stuff happens. Soon Arnold realizes that the Stock Broker who was trying to protect was infact Satan himself. Satan had come to earth to impregnate a chosen woman so that she would give birth to his anti-christ son causing the end of days.
A great movie with great effects, I absolutely love that score to it. It gives a creepy feeling to this action/horror film. This is one of the movies that I wouldn't mind buying. Many people disagree with me on if it is good of not but in my opinion it is.

1075542,1,6305767866,"For the love of God, for once can someone make a movie about Heaven and Hell that true to the judeo-christian beliefs they come from?
It is not the point of this review to argue whether or not God and Satan exist, but the fact is this movie asks that you believe they do for the purposes of this story. Only, the fictitious existence of God and Satan in this story is completely imaginary. Just like every secular story about Heaven and Hell, it's completely off base from the beliefs they come from. This movie is about the End of Days fortold in the book of Revelations, but unlike what at least one other reviewer would have you believe, the events in this movie are nothing like what's told in that book. If you're gonna tell a story based on the Bible, at least read it so you get it right. This movie gets it so wrong, it's laughable.
But it's not the Biblical inaccuracies that make this movie so bad, the story is just proposterous. Seriously, this movie is nothing more than Arnold vs. Satan. That's what it should have been called. This movie actually pits Arnold vs. Satan one on one and asks that you suspend your belief enough to see the plausability. Give me a break! People gave this movie five stars?!?!? The closest Arnold's ever come to a five star movie would be in one of James Cameron's films. This film's not even close.
Honestly, this film is one of the lamest ways people cashed in on the whole Y2K panic, and even in that setting it was an awful film. Now? I can't even put into words...",1051056000,3,1512,4.365248226950355

1075544,5,6305767866,"I really don't understand why people are so negative to this movie. Both Arnold and Gabriel does a excellent job portraiting hero and Villain, or Man VS Satan if you do prefer so. The filming is dark, serious, and there is no sanctuary to hide. The movie is about Satan looking for a specific girl which unlocks the gate to hell, so that he can take over Earth. Of Course, Arnie, a tired-of-life-special-unit with the name ""Jericho"" ends up protecting the girl from Satan, which has taken the body of an ordinary Wall Street Man who can roam the streets freely and literally, make hell.
This movie can be looked at from different angles. You can look at it in the easy way, ""Girl in Danger, Man protects Girl with everything he got and fights Satan"" or you can look at it the deep way, plunging into our own ghosts, and the purity of humanity and our belief. Is really god good? The best thing about the movie, is that Satan actually makes the best points here.
Gabriel Byrne is superb. He has a way of acting, a way of staring behind your eyes and grabbing you that no other actors can. I this movie, he perfect as the personification of Evil. The best scene, with Jericho and Satan exchanging wits, is stunningly cool. In some moments you actually feel tempted to give in to Satan, much because Byrne`s EXCELLENT acting.
I won't give to much away, but one other scene is incredible.
The scene when you see that even God is helpless and cannot protect humans against Satan, when Satan just walks into the church with a grin on his face and...raises hell.
Oh the Music! John Debney made a terrific score for End of Days, eerie, bombastic, directly freaky and dark. Its as much evil as Satan himself.
Absolutely stunning movie. If you like this, I`d also suggest Stigmata, lot more horror, less action, but an equally superb Gabriel Byrne. Oh, I forgot too. Arnold is very good in this movie. ... This is the right Arnold that we all have come to like, he takes his role serious, and he plays it solid.
Yes there are maybe some plotholes here and there..the dialogue can be a bit thin some places, and scenes are often cut too soon into other scenes, but that does not prevent this movie from being so strong. Oh, if you listen very careful you can hear Guns N`Roses - Oh My god in the background near the end of the movie.
Now tell me that isn't cool.",1046822400,,2351,4.419354838709677
1075545,2,6305767866,"Gabriel Bryne as the devil is exceptionally well played. You get the feeling he is having the time of his life camping things up. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't quite as lucky. Again we find Arnold cast as the hero although this time with a dark side that is a nice idea but not followed through well enough. The other area that is pleasant is watching Arnold being the one smacked around for much of the film.
The explosions and pyrotechnics are all well done but what could have been a great film is simply a decent one. The plot has lots of potential. Unfortunately the plot and all characters get 'b' movie treatment in an 'a' movie explosion-fest.
For mindless entertainment End of Days is good, but you get the impression more was intended and the film simply doesn't deliver.
Arnold's films are a guilty pleasure for me. I like his work ethic applied to acting. He has improved and expanded beyond simple roles like this. Dealing with the end of the world would have been much more interesting with more substance and less explosions.
Good films by Schwarzenegger:
Terminator I & II
The Running Man - vastly underrated
Total Recall
the lighter side:
Kindergarden Cop
Twins
True Lies
So it's not that Arnold isn't capable, it's that in part, we as audience don't support his lighter films like we do the action hero stuff. Considering he's getting up there in age it might not be such a bad idea to start casting him as an older character, but I digress.
If you want lots of bangs and booms with a good dose of violence look no further. If you are looking for lots of substance take a pass. Still this is entertaining if you want to slip into couch potato mode.",1045872000,,1664,4.53156146179402
1075546,4,6305767866,"""End of Days"" had its main character more realistic than other
Arnold films, he was not invincble in this role, had suicidal
tendency due to the painful lost of family and suffered from the guilt thereafter. Arnold portrayed this characther with emotions that I could identify with, very real, and his acting was quite subtle at some scenes, I was not a fan until I saw this one, then consequently I bought it on DVD.
The main problem about this film is its trailer, I don't konw if the trailer on DVD was actually the theatrical trailer while
it released, but it's very unappealing compared to the substance of this film to say the least.
On the contrary, the two MV on DVD are much better editted than the trailer, I am glad Terminator 3 will be released by Warner Bros instead of Universal Studio, at least WB knows better when it comes to promotion. It's a pitty that ""End of Days""was much superior than it seemed from the trailer.
Other complaint is that the DVD reveals too much secret of the special effects making, it's terrific that those stunts were made very belivable, and the CGI was great, but is it necessary to exhibit how they were made? It only reduces wonderment next time you see it, personally I would rather not know these technical things, and believe it's all actually happened (e.g.
church explosion and train derailment).
Other than those two mentioned above, this film is very good, its atmosphere is thrilling, Usually I hate to watch action movie, especailly violent ones. But Arnold 's acting in this film impressed me a lot and keep me captivated throughtout the viewing, It's probably that I like to watch a realistic character more than super human ones although the latter are cooler.
End of Days is my second favorite Schwarzenegger movie,
btw he looked very good in this film, not changed a bit since I
last saw him in Eraser except that his performance in End of Days is better than Eraser, he didn't look older after several years, he's more than double my age, but that's not the point, the point is he looks really great and charismatic, it's quite amazing.",1040601600,2,2097,4.639784946236559
1075637,4,6305767866,"I think one of the biggest reasons this film is so criticized is because of its budget.  If this were a low-budget film, it would have been hailed by B-movie fans as a new schlock classic, but it is tough to watch this film without noticing its large budget and I agree that there is no way a movie with so many plot holes, logical inconsistencies, bad acting, etc., should have ever cost so much.  But if you try to pretend it is a low budget piece of cheese, the outrage is replaced by a tremendous sense of fun.
Besides the plot holes, this film has all the elements of a true classic schlock movie.  There is the truly-talented-slumming-actor (Gabriel Byrne as Satan, playing a role you know he had fun with).  There is the has-been-former-box-office-draw, the aging-action-movie-star and the muscle-bound-ham (all three roles superbly filled by Schwarzenegger, our generation's cross between Steve Reeves, Tor Johnson and Elizabeth Taylor).  All the minor characters are portrayed with such awful acting you can't help but break into laughter.  The movie deliberately taps into the latest zeitgeist (the upcoming millennium).  And there is loads of unintentional humour, non-stop action, violence, special effects, and the occasional truly inspired scene.  The scenes of Byrne going around wreaking havoc are especially interesting and could eventually help make this film an exploitation classic (it already would be if it had come out in the 1970s).  (I won't spoil your entertainment with the details, but one of those scenes is like the famous opening to the alleyway scene from the first Toxic Avenger movie).
For a truly good film about the millenium and the antichrist, see the excellent Italian film ""The Day of the Beast"".  But for a fun film worth a few laughs, this movie is far superior to ""The Omen"".",1027900800,,1818,4.9506578947368425

1075639,2,6305767866,"Take Arnold Schwarzenegger, mix with a plot involving a showdown with Satan, add some campy acting and bad lapses in logic, and you'll get End of Days, a movie that begs to be better than what it is, and could and should have succeeded where other movies like this fail.  Schwarzenegger plays a burned out bodyguard who has lost his faith in Gid and mourning the deaths of his wife and child, and then finds himself protecting a young woman (Robin Tunney) from Satan (Gabriel Byrne).  What results is your typical, predictable cat & mouse movie with the odds pinned up so much against Arnie & crew, but naturally he finds a way to win, even if its against the devil.  The plot is just so conventional, you can even tell whats going to happen before it happens.  There are some good qualities though, the ending was different, making the film not as horrible as it could have been, and the cast; including Kevin Pollak, Cch Pounder, and Rod Steiger; is a nice touch.

1075641,4,6305767866,"While not the perfect, End of Days is certainly a well-crafted thriller with plenty to offer.
The year is 1999, and it's days before New Years in New York City, where Satan (Gabriel Byrne) has come to Earth to find the woman who will bear his child, bringing about the ""end of days"".  This woman (Robin Tunney) was born in 1979 during a phenomenon that marked her as the mother of Satan's child.  Sound complicated and odd?  Not to worry, the film does an excellent job of setting everything up to get to the action scenes.  When Satan takes the body of an investment banker, it is Jherico Caine (Schwarzenegger) who is unknowingly protecting him.  When he foils an assassination attempt, he and his partner (Kevin Pollak) uncover a frightening web of conspiracy that leads them all over the city, with Satan hot on their tails.
Director Peter Hyams (The Relic) keeps the mood appropriately dark and creepy.  The special effects are extremely well-done, especially in the film's thrilling climax.
Arnie plays the same character he always does: the guy who has to save the world.  Though it's his stereotypical character, Schwarzenegger pulls it off well here.  However, Gabriel Byrne is the real star here, playing Satan in haunting fashion.  Tunney (The Craft) does a decent job as the chosen bride of Satan.  Kevin Pollak, CCH Pounder, and Udo Kier are all top-notch in their supporting roles.
The DVD of this film is excellent, to say the least.  Commentarys, specail effects spots, music videos, and trailers are all among the array of extras.  The picture and sound are top quality.  Universal Studios always does a great job with it's DVD releases, and End of Days is no exception.
End of Days is, overall, a very good film that will appeal to fans of several different genres.  Whether your thing is horror, suspense, drama, or just Arnie, End of Days certainly won't disappoint.",1021161600,,1886,4.816770186335404

I think most devil movies just have problems not seeming corny and this film is no exception. If this was not an action film than it would have really flopped. There are a number of good action scenes and some sharp special effects. Schwarzenegger is strong at times as he plays a more beat-up character than usual. Gabriel Byrne does well, but seems bored at times. The bottom line is that the film is entertaining even if though it has a number of gaps. The DVD looks very sharp and has a number of extras. There is a behind the scenes segment, commentary and videos, but the coolest extra has to be the special effects section. This takes the viewer throught the process of how a number of the more spectular effects were done and it really helps one to appreciate what went into this film.

1075644,2,6305767866,"End of Days is one of those action thrillers that one day will wind up on a wonderful list known as Bad Movies We All Love. But it takes a few years to achieve such cult status, and, so, I am left to deal with today. I don't intentionally have it in for this type of picture, but the genre today has a lot in common with pop music, because they both have such specific target markets. In the case of action thrillers, it is fourteen to twenty-five year old males. There's nothing at all wrong with having a particular audience in mind. The problem is that, by limiting the appeal, you tend to crystallize the subject matter. You fall into a pattern of rehashing the same material, because, as one group outgrows your genre, there's a fresh one to take it's place.
I suppose that End of Days would have been more interesting ten years ago. That was when CGI and other digital effects were new and fresh to the eye. Today, it's just another costly FX driven movie. Compare it to another Arnold Schwarzenegger picture, the much better Total Recall [1991], and you'll see what I mean. ...
Then there are the special effects. They are spectacular, but predictable. Some are a bit weird. In several scenes, such as a restaurant's blowing up, the street traffic just keeps moving. Even New Yorkers are not quite that jaded. In another, The Man falls twenty stories and lands on a SUV. Its alarm goes off, the vehicle is totaled, but no crowd gathers. The movie is especially prone to defying the laws of physics. There is a chase scene aboard a runaway subway train. Jericho manages to uncouple the car he and the girl are in. The rest of the train jumps the tracks and wrecks. Moments later, their car plows into the wreck. Do they jump out of the car? No, they just run to the rear and grab hold of a support pole.

Turns out the wall street broker is the host of satan itself, who needs to father a child with a chosen woman who is being kept cluelessly waiting by an intricate conspiracy of satanists.  None of it makes sense, but it is entertaining nonsense to watch.

They serve the city of New York trying to protect Christine York (Robin Tunney) from the grasps of Satan.  Arnold says no way Jose to Satan as he fights to protect Christine.  Arnold, as in all his movies, has a lot of big guns to fight Satan and provides great one-liners as usual.  He resurrects his career with this film and it is probably the best since Red Sonja. Who said Arnold couldn't act? Arnold provides us with some great dramatic moments such as the time when he see a vision of his family in danger and pulls out a gun to try to fight them off.  The Austrian Oak flexes his muscle and does plenty of blasting in this film.  It has great stunts such as the helicopter chase and the explosions that Gabriel Byrne causes.  Arnold wide screen is better than Arnold in the big screen. When it was all said and done I felt he definitely deserved an award for this film. Arnold looks better than ever in terms of physique.

MY REVIEW:
This movie is hard to categorize as whether it's an action movie, a horror film, a spiritual/religious film or just a thriller type drama with great special effects.
Director PETER HYAMS (The Relic, The Musketeer) directs this ensamble group of actors which include: ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ROBIN TUNNEY, KEVIN POLLACK, GABRIEL BYRNE and ROD STEIGER.
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER deserves a lot of credit for his role, which can very well be related to MEL GIBSON's character in LETHAL WEAPON.  What strikes me as odd is his ability to really show character and acting ability.  I've never seen him do anything like this before.  He really is a simple, caring, emotional human being who isn't just out there to shoot everything up and save the day.  He cares for this girl and cares for the world, which is something ARNOLD has never done before.  His age is starting to show, but he still pulls this one off, and still knows hard-core action.
GABRIEL BYRNE deserves an Academy Award, pulling his Satan character off perfectly.  There is nothing scary about his performance, it's just the fact that you can actually see the evil in his character.  His lines are great, and his performance is spectacular.  For those of you who might be thinking like ANTHONY HOPKINS as HANNIBAL LECTER- you've got it.  It's that kind of chilling performance, that isn't scary, just fun and thrilling.
ROBIN TUNNEY is probably the worst actress in this movie.  Her character is very unbelievable.  She can't work well with dialouge.  This role was just obviously to serious for her to pull off with a charm.  You literally have no feeling for this woman because she has no character built around her.  TUNNEY works better as her role in VERTICAL LIMIT.  This role might-as-well been given to MOLLY SHANNON!!!  ROBIN TUNNEY just couldn't pull it off.
KEVIN POLLACK plays BOBBY CHICAGO, the hilarious sidekick pal, opposite SCHWARZENEGGER.  His lines are great, and will make you laugh a lot of the time.  His character is realistic and often fun.  He's of course the comedic humor of the film, which every film has to have at some point.
ROD STEIGER just looks like a priest to me, and that's what he is, and plays a good one.  There couldn't have been a better choice.  Just take one look at him and you'll know.
Potentially the story for the film is interesting, but considering that writer ANDREW MARLOWE (Hollow Man, Air Force One) was trying to follow the book of REVELATION, I take away half a star.  The story is inaccurate, although fun and action packed.  This is one of the best scripts he's ever written.
I was in awe by the directing of PETER HYAMS who's past credits include 2010 and THE RELIC.  He really worked well with the majority of actors and pulled the story together.  He deserves some credit as well.
The special effects were above average, from the explosions to train wrecks and so on.  STAN WINSTON's SATAN creature was top notch and could scare the heck out of even ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER!  If the majority of people don't give this movie credit for its story and acting, they have to at least give credit to the special effects.
I look at this film as a serious one, specifically because I'm a Christian myself and I find this story a very compelling one.  Although the film is very inaccurate, it is still an entertaining film which is more serious than most people think.  It's funny to see people put this film down when it's something they couldn't do in a lifetime.
Why don't people like this movie?  It's simple.  People look at movies in different directions than others.  Most people think of this one as a cheap piece of nonsense that tries to use a biblical story as a backdrop for a special effects actioner starring ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.  I look at it as all around good-time fun.  The really STRANGE sex scene and language wasn't needed, which could've possibly lowered the rating to a PG-13.  And if you pump up ROBIN TUNNEY's character to a solid, than you got a five star movie.  But the way it lies, in my eyes, it deserves four stars.  No one can deny this movie is entertaining, but no one can deny that this film also has its failures....",997315200,2,4867,4.627039627039627

First of all this movie(in the plot) establishes the reality of Satan. He's real(in the movie). So if Satan is real then God must be as well, right? But wait a minute! WE created God so he really doesnt exist,  thats why he's not in the movie - just a bunch of eccentric followers of his that are foolish enough to believe that he does indeed exist. So the devil is real but God isnt, and when he(devil) shows up then its up to man to stop him cause God(who doesn't exist anyway cause he doesnt show up in the film) isn't really real. But the devil is so..............cough, vomit, drool.............ugggh. This is old news. Holywood hates Christians.....period. To them we are a bunch of racist, self serving, homophobic maggots who are responsible for all the evils in society due to our intolerence of drugs, adultry, homosexuality and such.

On thing you can tell is that Arnold isn't having much fun. But I can see why. If I were surrounded by 99% antichrists, I would try to find a way. This girl on there who's mom was supposed to be evil, thought that she could get rid of the devil that easily. I can't believe it! As much as you may disagree with me, I believe that since we all have an ""eternal life"" deal and a ""life after death"" situation where your soul never ends. That's why I thought it was okay when I saw the evil spirit go from another guy to him. And at the end he kills himself, and in the background you see his wife and daughter. However, it's real short and whenever his friend took the devil's advice, things finally changed. Then on the liquid oily gas, the devil puts a lighter on there and makes fire go to the car that (Arnold's character) was in. And there were parts whenever crowds of people were at parties since it was supposedly end-1999, (what some thought of, ""end of world"").
I just thought that this movie was short of motivation. On it, it only had Arnold fighting the evil, and it would have got my attention if at least a few others were.

1075830,3,6305767866,"Arnold Schwarzenegger films are unique in that they usually travel down two different avenues: they are either good entertainment, such as his acting in ""Twins"" and the ""Terminator"" series, or they become major flops, like the sleeper ""Jingle All The Way."" Very rarely do they go down both avenues, as is the case with the apocalyptic thriller ""End of Days,"" which has its pros and cons all around. While there is an interesting premise about the test of faith against evil, this is clearly a typical Arnold movie, bogging the rest of the film down with special effects and action sequences complete with lots of gunfire and explosions. Arnold has never had to fight a character as powerful as Satan, so what makes him think that guns and bombs will send him back to hell?
As the movie opens, the Vatican is given a heavenly sign that the coming of Satan is near, and the fortold prophecy of doom is realized as true. 30 years later, Satan rises up out of the sewers in (where else) New York City, where he inhabits the body of a man whom we are never introduced to or given any detail about. I had a tough time deciding as to whether or not this was positive or negative for the overall feel of the film: if we knew more about him, it might make us feel a bit of sympathy for him even though his actions are not really his own, but that of the possessor of his body and mind. It also does add a hint of mystery to his character, not knowing anything about him, because it might take away the focus of Satan's planned actions.
His plans involve finding citizen Christine York, who is haunted by grizzly dreams of being taken by a mysterious man and conceiving his child. She begins receiving physical signs, too, including a strange hobo on a subway who bursts into pieces before her eyes. We also learn earlier in the movie that she has been destined since birth for this task, and is now living with the nurse who aided in her birth. Of course, she is a Satanist who took the small child into the catacombs of the hospital to have a mumbo-jumbo curse placed upon her, so when we realize she is taking care of the grown Christine, it all falls into place.
In comes Jericho Cane, the tough cop who has an emotional side, too. He is assigned to protect the mysterious man who is possessed by Satan, under the guise of being a Wall Street broker. After a shootout that begins in the streets and ends up in a subway tunnel, Cane begins investigating, and soon learns that Christine is in danger, and after he saves her as well, he knows that something other than just physical danger is at work. Now it is up to him to keep the girl out of Satan's grasp, all the while fighting an emotional battle within himself against turning her in in exchange for the devil's empty promises of bringing back his murdered wife and child.
The story does have a promising freshness about it: Satan's coming back and reincarnating himself by sleeping with a human soul has really never been done before. He has possessed others in other movies, for sure, but the movie is able to say that this is not enough for him to take over the world and add an extra task for him to accomplish, therefore making it interesting and giving it credibility. The battle between good and evil also touches on some good key themes here, especially when dealing with the empty promises of the devil. Jericho is promised that he will have his wife and daughter back if he gives the girl over to Satan, and even though he has never really believed in God's power since their deaths, he sticks to his faith and continues to battle his adversary.
However, his fight against this particular adversary is not all about faith and religion, which is part of the reason for this movie's lackluster appeal. Come on, he's fighting Satan here. Satan is one of the most brutal and intelligent enemies to ever walk the face of the Earth, and here we are given sequences of gunfire, with Jericho shooting the man Satan inhabits to try and destroy him. Sure, the man may die, but Satan will live on, but the characters never really seem to realize this. Also, we are given lots of explosions and fire, which do tend to ruin the movie, but also do add to the association of Satan with fire and hellish settings.
There is also a substantial amount of blood and gore that has to do with Satan's revenges against the holy people of Earth. One scene involves a man being mounted to the ceiling by scalpels, with letters of a different language carved into his skin. Also, there are scenes of a man's burning death, which is quite graphic. This is supposed to be a movie about faith and using that faith to fight evil, and the gore and violence take away some of the emphasis from this aspect of the story.
The acting does turn out to be a postive, though, with a cast that is involving and pleasing to the eye. Arnold Schwarzenegger is Jericho Cane, and this gives him one of his most challenging roles to date. Arnold is required to show a lot of emotional and physical stress, and Schwarzenegger is able to play all of this out just as good as any other actor available. Robin Tunney keeps up the woman-in-distress angle as Christine York, and for the most part, her character waits to be saved, but she plays it so well that it does not matter. Her fright it presented nicely as well. Rounding out the ensemble, though, is the suave Gabriel Byrne, who plays the man possessed by Satan. He has so much to offer the role that if their really is a Satan, then this is what he is most likely to be like.
""End of Days"" fails solely on the basis of its special effects and unneeded action and gore, which tend to weigh it down from being a totally enjoyable thriller. It does have a good story, with characters that do have somewhere to go. If only those filmmakers would let them explore more of the territory around them instead of filling in the holes with useless action.",982627200,3,5913,4.440662373505059
1075831,5,6305767866,"The start of the film is amazing,whitout giving away the plot, there is plenty of explosings and action, Good Points: Arnie is in top form. Plenty of violence. (i'am a viloence lover in films) The Devil is unbeliable in the film. Bad Points: It finished to soon! Now with the main review: Arnie starts in the film as a suicial idiot who loves his job and who he protects. During the film he changes from this state to hero that must protect a woman from the man he protectedand took a shot for early  in the film. The devil is in side the body of Gaberiel Bryne who is so cool in the film as such he makes a pest of himself around Arnie. Also he gets hit whith weapons the army would not get to use for a long time. The film has the best ending a film of this type could have.(Don't worry i won't say what it is.) So i recomened this film for not just fans of Arnie anyone who loves a action packed thriller crossed between a ""End Of Days"" type of film. So i say buy it!. Also if you know how to work your DVD player you can use the extra features. If you have a subwoofer, hook it up now and listen to the best DC(Digtial Cinema) sound you will ever hear!.

The only part that digusted me was that blender scene. He mixes so much sick crap, I don't want to lose y'all's appatites.
The devil goes in other people's bodies and was killed by (I'm not good with names, I know it was played by Arnold though) the one who was good, because he later got the other guy on the bad side. Then after it goes into his body and he jumps from that church then it stabs him at that one part so then it takes him away, and the daughter Emily and his wife are both there. The only other real problem is that no other people were there to fight. The police Marge was kinda fake and went to the church but really wasn't that good of a character.

But it's not Jerry Lewis or Sartre--maybe somewhere in between--so I admit it, I liked it, I think's a good investment of your time.
I say that because the DVD is great.  Acoustically and visually terrific.  The movie itself is very slick, if unoriginal:  if you've seen The Omen, The Exorcist, The Devil's Advocate...you get the idea.  Nothing new here, but that's sort of understandable given the 2,000 year old story line.  Gabriel Byrne is simply wonderful, and Robin Tunney lends a bit of toughness to what could have been a light role.  But the real charm of the DVD is Peter Hyam's director commentary.  He does a nice job of walking you through the set-up of the shots, giving a viewer a real appreciation of just how much minutiae gets addressed in high-budget films, and how much a director agonizes over every small touch.  His attention to detail is remarkable, his emotional investment is obvious, and you end up feeling sorry for the guy because of how this movie was received critically and commercially.
So..enjoy the movie for the good acting and incredible special effects.  And there are some very elegant and subtle camera shots you'll appreciate.  But cue up the director's commentary and learn a lot about this film, and film-making in general.  If you're a novice like me, you'll appreciate the education.",978480000,2,1480,4.73828125

He has all the persuasive skill that Lucifer has.  The way he acts is very smooth, wicked, and evil.  I give major props to him for his acting skills.  Arnold on the other hand is typical Arnold.  He is not here for showing emotion or a different point of view.  He is here to blow stuff up, and he does it very well.  A note to people making fun of his name ""Jericho"" maybe you should look in the scripture and find out where the name Jericho is from.  I will give you one fact that there are very mixed reviews on this movie.  If you are looking for something with an incredible plotline do not watch it.

When I finally watched it I felt stupid for wasting my time watching this. I tried my hardest to give this movie a chance will I was watching it but I just couldn't get into it, everything just sucked. Even Arnold's acting and action scenes were sub-par compared to his other movies. On top of that the ending was just awful and corny.  While on some movies I can't say enough good things about, I can't say enough bad things about this one.  Acting - terrible, characters - terrible, storyline - terrible etc etc. I can go on and on but now I will just give this film a 2. One star because of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

What saves this movie from being a complete dud, is the fantastic special effects which can easily stand up to any of Arnold's past films. Gabriel Byrne is great as the Devil, Robin Tunney is good as Christine.  Kevin Pollak and Arnold's characters were not developed enough to make this film work.
As far as the DVD goes, if you liked this film, you will love the DVD.  This thing is loaded with extras including 2 music videos, one with Everclear and another with Rob Zombie.  There is also interviews with the entire cast, a feature commentary with director Peter Hyams, a nice section that shows how they did all of the special effects, and an excerpt from the Book of Revelation upon which this movie's story was loosely based.

Secondly, I know some people will gripe about this, but how come ever movie with good and evil, evil is all powerful, and good is either weak and vunerable or doesn't seem to exist at all. None of the characters in this movie really believe in God, they just don't want satan taking over the earth. Also how come all these movies have some wierd formula that Satan can use to take over the world and only 3 people in existence know's about it. Come on... I'm not expecting a priest with a cape and a giant G on his chest, but I don't think that in the war against evil, God is passing out dasies. I'd love to see a movie where the demon in a movie runs up against someone good who is really pissed off.

OK, so the whole ""999"" thing was pretty crazy.  And yes, I don't know why Satan hired Jericho to protect him when he couldn't be killed anyway.  Yes, I also don't know why Satan's wounds could only heal themselves for a certain period of time.  If you're a critic, you'll let these things drag down the movie.
However, I was very entertained by this film.  The whole concept that a burned out suicidal cop could defeat Satan was very cool to me.  I loved the explosions, I loved the effects, and I loved Schwarzenegger's acting.  Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, and Robbin Tunney were all great as well.  The whole storyline just really thrilled me.

Gabriel Byrne does a great turn as Satan. Ok it is nothing like Pacino's attempt but it is convincingly downplayed. Robin Tunney seems to have grown up a lot since The Craft and portays the object of Satan's lust in a suitably bewildered and tearful manner.
The Devil has one night to impregnate a girl and bring on a thousand years of darkness. The Church are prepared to kill the girl. The religious twists are not really entered into in any depth but they are there as a backdrop to what is essentially an action film.

First, I was pleasantly surprised, but as soon as Arnold tried to cry  and became a character where you are supposed to feel sorry for, it became  unbelievable. And if a movie is unrealistic, it is not scary.
Of course  are there still some great effects and very good music by Everlast (I love  the song ""So Long"" and the videoclip which is shown on the DVD)  The action and the story are good as well and the extra's and the menu on  the DVD is great but Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't belong in a movie like  this.

1076192,1,6305767866,"Like so many apocalyptic movies spawned by the demonseed *Omen* in the early seventies, the plot of this poorly written film is discernable once those ubiquitous ""occult"" symbols appear in the opening sequence.  The movie begins promising enough (and I cannot fail to mention that the  opening menu sequence on the DVD is quite impressive), but quickly delves  into tried territory once we are introduced to an alcoholic Jerico (Arnold  has difficulty playing a suicidal drunk -- you don't get buff on booze,  that's for sure) with a gun to his head.

Essentially, the film attempts to appeal to our own sense of  ""evil"" as it is related to various insignia and iconography by  simply stringing these items together with little narrative depth (e.g.,  we're shown shots of Satanic symbols scrawled on walls, tongue-less priests  ramble on in mumbo-jumbo before crucified on ceilings, etc.).  THe problem  is that we're so saturated and familiar with this sort of stuff these days  that the ominous connotations don't seem to work as well any more (witness  Polanski's *Ninth Gate*--the film suffers similarly).  Because this film  doesn't develop any sense suspense or attempt to deepen the apocalyptic  narrative, it looks like a collection of urban explosions with a weak  ""occult"" narrative layered on top.  Hence, this movie is pretty  bad by most standards.  Even action movies lead you up (tease you) to the  explosions.  I like things-blowing-up, but I also like there to be reasons.

1076193,2,6305767866,"It usually takes a few decades, or at the very least, a fewyears for a film to become dated. ""End of Days,"" ArnoldSchwarzenegger's latest action film spectacular, achieves that distinction in a mere few months - truly a record-setting time. Released in November, 1999, the film, dealing with the apocalyptic events surrounding the dawning of the 3rd millennium, already seems hopelessly foolish just a few months into 2000.  Not that it played much better in the last century. For, in any and all eras, this film is a washout.
Apparently, having run out of villains for the indomitable Schwarzenegger to go up against, the filmmakers simply went straight to the top - or bottom - and found none other than Satan himself waiting in the wings. This screwy, laughable tale of the devil and his minions wreaking havoc in pre-New Year's Eve Manhattan runs through all the cliches we have come to expect from all the films (from ""The Omen"" movies on down)that have attempted to turn the biblical account of the final days into dubious horror movie entertainment.
Not directly inspired by the Book of Revelations, the story puts forth the notion that, at the turn of every millennium, Satan has one opportunity to mate with the preordained woman of his choice in order to overthrow God and destroy the world. Schwarzenegger, as a former cop driven to alcoholism and suicidal despair by the murders of his wife and daughter, somehow becomes the sole protector of the innocent woman whose fate has become so inextricably entwined with that of the whole human race.
The villain of the film - in this case Satan himself - lacks even a modicum of consistency in terms of his supernatural attributes. He can bend time, eliminate anyone he chooses at will and in the most unlikely fashion; he can raise people from the dead, yet he is unable to locate the whereabouts of this one defenseless, unenlightened young woman. Time after time she manages to slip through his fingers as he bumbles his way through the subway tunnels and dark city streets of a drizzly Manhattan.
By combining two genres, the film simply doubles up its cliches. Thus, in addition to all the action film paraphenalia one expects from such a film - countless explosions, runaway subway cars, improbable helicopter stunts, gruesome deaths and, even the oldest cliche of all, a cat jumping out to startle a gullible and easily fooled audience - we are subjected to the usual array of black masses, psychotic, self-mutilating priests, debased religious imagery and, of course, warring factions of Catholic hierarchy who huddle in the dark recesses of the Vatican and debate the morality of killing the innocent girl chosen to be Satan's bride - all elements invariably associated with stories of this kind.
In the sunset of his career as an action hero, who would deny Schwarzenegger his little bit of self-indulgent self-aggrandizement? But, really, turning him into a Christ figure does seem a trifle much to swallow even for his most devoted fans. As to his ""acting,"" the less, as usual, said about that the better. But, after his recent appearance in the similarly themed but equally awful ""Stigmata,"" perhaps Gabriel Byrne (who plays the part of Satan) should start seeking out his own absolution - or, at the very least, some better movie roles.",964396800,3,3306,4.9035714285714285

What was so wrong you ask?  Let me tell  you...  First off, Arnold cannot play the depressed/suicidal hero roll.  He  just can't.  I expect him to either be: 1. a happy and charismatic hero or  2. a menacing villain who is devoid of emotion.  There is no in between.
Second, the plot and dialog were so poorly written that I actually felt  silly for renting the movie.  I have been a fan of Robin Tunney since  ""Empire Records,"" but in this film she is given very little room  (via dialog) to develop her character, and the only impression she is  allowed to portray is the deer-in-the-headlights image.  She can't do  anything for herself, outside of being a waiting for Satan, and she ends up  being more of a prop than a real character.
Yes the action and special  effects were good, and if that's all your after, then by all means, rent  this movie.  If you want a plot, good dialog, a decent cast of characters,  or even some sort of realism- be it religious or physical- then do not even  think about this movie.
The critics are right.  End of Days is a dog.",963878400,5,1569,4.460992907801418
1076195,4,6305767866,"Well, I rented End of Days the first weekend it was available on DVD. A friend said it was a very scary movie, and for about the first third of the movie, it is one of the scariest things I've seen in a while. This part is  similar to Stigmata, but possibly even scarier. However, when this scary  part ends, the movie becomes just another  action film, as everything seems  to want to be blown up. This isn't taking anything away from the fact that  it's a good action movie, but I think it could have been so much more than  it is. Depending on your tastes, I would reccomend this movie.",962928000,2,589,4.214285714285714
1076196,4,6305767866,"Since this film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, I went into it expecting very little.  I thought it would be another hokey beat-um-up.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the film's ability to create a strong feeling of  suspense.  Did you ever have a dream where you're being chased, and no  matter what you do, you simply can't escape your pursuer?  That is the  feeling embodied in this movie.  Robin Tunney is absolutely superb as  ""the chosen one"" who must escape Satan, who is trying to take  advantage of his only opportunity to impregnate her, thereby allowing him  permanent entry into the terrestrial realm.
So why not 5 stars?  As good  a job as Arnold does in this film, he is given some dramatic scenes that he  can't seem to pull off.  He's the angry, throw-caution-to-the-wind tough  guy who's never been the same since he lost his family; it's become an  action movie stock character we've seen before.
My other issue is with  Robin Tunney's character.  For much of the film, she is pretty much  helpless and doesn't do much to help herself.  Tunney is so capable that  the film would have been much better if she had been allowed to be more  active than passive; the director should have made use of her obvious  talents.
These drawbacks are extremely minor, however, and hardly detract  from the rest of the film, which is extremely fun.  It's been awhile since  I've come across a film as suspenseful as this one.  Buy it.",962755200,,1442,4.682730923694779

Arnold is back, and this time he is not battling other Terminators, but instead Satan himself.  Who wins?  Who do you think?
End of Days is another film in the long line of supernatural  films of which I think we all have just about had our fill.  Arnold plays  Jericho Cain who must protect a woman from being impregnated by Satan.  Exciting, huh?  Well, the real problem here is you will be bored through  most of the movie.  Sure, there are some nice action sequences, but none  that will stick with after you have left the theatre (nothing as ground  breaking as we saw in The Matrix).  The characters are dull all except for  Kevin Polluck's character who does have some good one liners.
The real  problem with this film is that you will get the ""been here, done  that"" before feeling all the way through.  I sure did.  There was  nothing original in this film to keep my interest.  Plus, the film is long  and drawn out.  I go to an Arnold film to a) see him make a fool of himself  (a la Kindergarten Cop) or b) see him kill a lot of people.  He does  neither here.

1076290,4,6305767866,"This is Arnold's best movie in the past two years.  While I thought Eraser was decent, Batman and Robin just stunk.  So Arnold comes out with this movie called ""End of Days.""  While I was intrigued by the  previews, I didn't get my hopes up.
Well, let's see.  First the story of  the film.  I don't care how many of you say that the story is horrible.  Personally, I think that there's a great story within this film.  Arnold  plays a suicidal cop named Jericho Caine.  After a banker was shot at by a  hitman at the top of a building, Jericho goes on a chase after him.  It's  found out that this man is a priest who tells Jericho of the ""End of  Days.""  The devil is back and ready for some loving.
Arnolds  performance in this movie is excellent.  It's actually a very different  role for the man, and he does it with his natural flair and style.  The  rest of the actors are also very good and I have yet to see a flaw in any  of their performances.
The music in the movie is haunting and just  perfect for this sort of movie.  The score has the ability to creep you out  even in the most tame scenes of the movie.  An extremely well done musical  factor in the movie.
The DVD extra features are extremely plentyful and  are definitely your money's worth.  I still can't get enough of Everlast's  ""So Long"" music video (included in the extras) which is only  availible on that DVD.
Now, this movie isn't without it's flaws.  Most of  it is in story, but I can't really say them without giving the movie away.  Also, I don't enjoy all the references to the millenium, which just  continually add to the cheese factor of the story already established by  some of the scenes.
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy this movie  just because of that.  The ending is excellent and the whole movie is just  extremely haunting.  No, it's not a scary movie.  It's more like ""The  Sixth Sense"" on steroids.  The DVD is definitely worth the money for  the excellent sound and video quality.  This will be one of my favorite  Arnold movies to date, next to T2 and True Lies.",961977600,2,2067,4.307086614173229

But I was sort of wrong, I didn't totally enjoy this flick, it was a bit silly really, but a fun and sexy horror film away. The acting is  absolutely terrible, but it is one of those lame movies that keeps you  wrapped around its finger.
Not only do we see the return of Arnold, but  The Craft's Robin Tunney appears again to play a mentally challenged young  lady who gets treated badly by the devil himself. Of course, Arnie comes to  the rescue, but then he realizes he must take on Satan himself.
End of  Days is not exactly as good as I expected, or not like what I expected, but  the film is good for those Arnie fans who want a wild rollercoaster ride!",961632000,,741,4.176056338028169

1076294,2,6305767866,"""End of Days"" is not good. I love big-budget action movies -- that's why I went to see ""Days."" I think that Arnold can put in a good performance; his range isn't the male equivelent to Meryl Streep's,  but as he has shown in films such as ""Twins,"" he has good comedic  timing, while in other flicks such as ""T2,"" he showed powerful,  yet subtle and effective character development. In the body-building  documentary that prominently featured Arnold on film for the first time,  entitled ""Pumping Iron,"" we got to see him at the top of his  game; his life's passion was demonstrated extremely well, and showed how  intense and focused this man is. But in ""Days,"" it wasn't there.  The character, and even the film called for something ... but it was  missing.
Arnold's character called for a depressed alcoholic. While I  applaud the filmakers and the script-writers for inserting what should have  been a complex hero, it came across as programmed and unsympathetic.
My  other problem with this film was that it was too overt. Its symbolism: I  felt that the filmakers were trying to shove it down the audiences'  throats. Biblical names, such as ""Cane"" and ""Jericho,""  and the play on words: ""Christine York."" (Did Christ foresee New  York 2000 years ago?) Obviously, one of the appeals of this movie was its  millennial connotations of the end of the world, but give the public some  credit for being able to grasp the theological overtures without the help  of a simple name. The same went for the special effects. How big can you  make the devil? Try for the ""Blair Witch Project"" effect; avoid  showing the film's demon and leave it up to your smart audiences'  imagination.
Action movies can be good and not good. Arnold too. We've  seen his work, and we know he and the filmakers can do a lot better than  this.",961372800,,1818,4.680379746835443
1076295,3,6305767866,"Despite other people's bad words on the subject, I enjoyed this movie. I really don't see the ""logical holes"" people are talking about. Everything made sense, just as long as you remember the film's explanations  and don't try to make up your own, like one reviewer obviously tried to  do.
All of the acting was believeable (And Gabriel Byrne did a great  job!), the plot moved along well and kept me in suspense (every time you  think things are going well, something worse happens), and there were none  of the gratuitous crises that seem to creep into the mediocre action moves  (Mission to Mars and Armageddon are good examples).
The only complaint I  have is that I could have done without the nude scenes. The point could  have been as clearly made without bare breasts, and that alone makes me a  lot less likely to reccomend this to my friends. Arnold, if you want to see  breasts, buy a nudie mag. If you're making an action end-of-the-world  movie, make it about THAT, not about bosoms.",961027200,,996,4.634285714285714

1076445,4,6305767866,"It is really easy to nitpick this movie.  The plot is farfetched (but how many action movie plots are realistic?), it's visually dark (which was OK in theaters, but is a bad thing for home viewers), and it requires Arnold  to act (which was quite funny).
Yes, it is easy to nitpick it, but that  does not hide the fact that this is a FUN movie.  The acting is decent and  the effects are good.  Like many movies these days, it isn't straight  horror or action, but a mixture of both, with some humor thrown in.
As I  mentioned earlier, some of the (unintentionally) humorous moments come at  the expense of Arnold.  When he is in the Church asking for strength from  God, I almost fell out of my chair laughing.  Don't get me wrong, I like  him in the movies, he just isn't a great actor.  In the end though, I feel  he was a good choice for the role of Jericho in the movie.
The DVD itself  is nice indeed.  Given Special treatment by Universal, the extras will take  some time to go through.  I particularly liked the section that explains  how the special effects were accomplished.

1076446,1,6305767866,"I've gotten to the point at which there are certain things that I would like to be explained to me with Arnold Schwarzenegger in his films.  I am confused by the way that he looks.  He is almost always a policeman or an ex-policeman, a soldier or an ex-soldier (green beret or commando or  special forces or ""black ops"" whatever that is) - twice he was a  research scientist, twice a bodyguard or something, twice an ordinary  father, and once he was jungle boy that had a twisted little dwarf as his  brother.  Twice, of course, he was a robot and that actually makes sense  with how he looks, robots can look and sound as ridiculous as they want to  (Robin Williams has now been a robot: case closed), the same goes with the  two times he was a pre-Christian barbarian.  But more often than not, Arnie  is a human being that happens to move and look like a pre-kiln slab of  river clay.  There is never an explanation as to why he sounds as he does  nor of how he finds the three or four hours a day to work out.  Just once  I'd like an explanation of how a boy raised in New York, third generation  Irish cop, would sound like he just rolled down a mountainside after  bugling through a giant horn.
End of Days is that most unforgivable of films.  It is the kind of  film that urges us to leave our brains at the door and hold on for the ride  - to remember when we were eight years old again.  In other words, it asks  us to be mentally challenged, emotionally immature, and so beaten by the  onward marching tide of culture that we are wholly incapable of not liking  something that cost 100 million dollars.  How Schwarzenegger remains a top  box office draw is an uneasy combination of the vast foreign box office  that think that Arnold somehow embodies capitalism (heck, he does!), and  the gleaming hope for a third installment in the Terminator series.  It  certainly can't be for such triumphs as Jingle All the Way, Eraser, Batman  & Robin, Junior and Last Action Hero.
At its best, End of Days  joyfully invites heckling and flabbergasted looks - at its worst, End of  Days is almost as aggressively condesending as Phantom Menace.  Still and  all, when excretia such as this earns its studio a tidy profit and truly  wonderful films like Wonder Boys spends a quick two month run at the  multi-plex, we deserve what we get.",960422400,9,2337,4.409411764705882

1076450,2,6305767866,"Like the wretched ""Stigmata"", this Schwarzenegger vehicle is a gorefest of truly stomach churning violence, masquerading as a religious fable.  It's something of an improvement over the pretentious  ""Stigmata""; however, its use of religious imagery as a means for  grotesque violence (people being crucified to a ceiling, having their  tongues cut out, etc.) is likely to offend atheists as well as Christians.
I found this film annoying enough to hit ""scan"" for the last  20-25 minutes.  I've sat through equally unpleasant films  (""Seven"" comes to mind) but ""End of Days"" is  predictable and boring.
There are some pluses, however.  The soundtrack  is the best Dolby Digital 5.1 I've heard in a long time, making excellent  use of the split surrounds for some very enjoyable sound effects.  Picture  quality is superb, and the lighting and makeup are effective without being  garish.
Schwarzenegger's performance is fairly close to convincing, given  that he's got a cookie-cutter role to deal with.  His sidekick, nicely  played by Kevin Pollack, provides some much-needed comic relief.  And  Gabriel Byrne as the Prince of Lies is good as usual; although after this  film and ""Stigmata"" I bet he's telling his agent not to send him  any more scripts for pseudo-religious trash.
Apparently Schwarzenegger's  fans enjoy this one, although he's not really the straight up action hero  of the type he plays in ""True Lies"" and ""Commando.""

Overall, it's more enjoyable than the standard ""end of the  world"" fare because, while it remains serious and dark, it also does  not take itself too seriously.  The result is some witty humor (although  don't be fooled, there's not alot of it!) and great action scenes.

My primary beef is the plot. The devil materializes out of a New  York sewer to have sex with a woman to bring about the ""end of  days,"" but there is no historical background laid out for the viewer  to understand just exaxctly why this sexual encounter is necessary. Was the  sexual encounter in itself instrumental to opening the gates of hell? Is  the potential offspring resulting from the sexual union relevant? Whatever  the answer, down-and-out cop Arnold's job is to mamke sure that the devil  doesn't get to the woman before Jan 1, 2000. For the special effects  afficiandos, there are plenty of guns, explosions, and nifty surreal  scenes. Gabriel Byrne does a great satan role, but I felt that some of his  lines about slamming the Almighty were a little too reminiscent of Al  Pacino's lines in "" The Devil's Advocate."" There are a lot of  ""book of revelations"" doomsday movies out there with much more  sophisticated plots, but few have the special effects this one has.

But as soon as Arnold has to save Robin Tunney from  the the incarnation of the Devil ( played very badly by the usually  enjoyable Gabriel Byrne), he turns back to the action hero everyone loved  before his surgery sidelined his career. Ultimately, it is a predictible  film at best, and one that won't put Arnold back on the map.

The overall plot premise is overly simple and  unoriginal.  How many movies do we need to see about the coming of Satan?  Not to mention more inaccurate ones!  The only good movie about the end of  time to my knowledge is Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Sign,""  which is not to be confused with ""The Seventh Seal,"" starring  Dimi More.  The flaws of EOD are countless so I won't even go into it much.  Just to skim the surface though, where was Jesus during all of this?  Where were the seven signs of the coming of Christ (not Satan)?  Why did  Satan not look like an angel before he took human form?  The Bible gives  specific descriptions of angels, and Lucifer was, in fact, an angel before  man came along.  Where did he get the power to take human form?  Good  grief, I could go on.  Let's just say it's obvious the writers weren't  Biblical scholars.  On top of this, we get Arnold walking around like a god  again.  He gets shot at three times by a priest bum with a gun less than  three inches from his face.  How did he miss?  Our hero walks up to two  police officers pointing guns at him and manages to kill both of them with  his concealed weapons?  What's funny is that they had already shot to kill  him ten seconds earlier.  Why didn't they just shoot him?  If you can't  tell, inaccurate movies really annoy me.  They were okay in the '80s, but  the movie industry has matured since then (well...sort of).  Anyway, I gave  the movie an extra star because Arnold does a good job in a rare role for  him.  You can actually see emotion in his character.  Also, his moral  dilemma was well portrayed when he is tempted by the devil.  However, it is  held back by wild inaccuracies, a poor script (they stole famous lines from  other movies for goodness sake), really bad editing, lame action sequences,  and the list goes on and on.

1076557,4,6305767866,"In the prologue to ""End of Days,"" we see a Pope reprimanding his cardinals for their alarmism and lack of faith.  Why?  Well, it's 1979, you see, and a prophetic comet has appeared in the sky, which means that  Satan's future bride will be born tonight, which will make her just about  20 years old in 1999, when the Beast rises to earth to find her and  ""know"" her (yes, in the Biblical sense), thus bringing the world  as we know it to a fiery end before Lucifer's ATM card goes whacko at  midnight on New Year's Eve.
Did you follow all that?
It's a typical  millenialist premise, yes.  But where other films would (and many have)  cast the Pope as a mindless, out-of-touch legalist whose only devotion is  to the public image of Mother Church, this Pope reminds his flock that God  is, after all, in control.  And where ""Ah-nold"" might be (as he  so often has been) cast as a one-dimensional muscle-bound action hero, we  find instead that Jericho is a man of feelings and of faith, of doubt and  guilt and shame and fear and all those other things that make us  human.
What a concept!  But will the story stay true to it to the  end?
""End of Days,"" even as it follows Lucifer's plot to get  the girl and torch the planet, also follows Jericho's journey from suicidal  guilt over the death of his wife and daughter, to a surprising kind of  reconciliation with himself and with God.  In fact, the climax of ""End  of Days"" includes a series of ""aha"" moments--an ending which  answers questions we hadn't realized were raised earlier in the film.  (I  wasn't surprised to learn, in the DVD's ""making of"" section, that  the writers had asked religious leaders of several denominations to  contribute to the story line.)  This is a faith story first and foremost,  and an action thriller almost incidentally.
The film does struggle in its  attempt to appeal to two contrasting audiences: Arnold's fan base may not  find this one as gory and action-packed as they have come to like.  And  folks who see this film because of its (vaguely) spiritual subject matter  might be distracted by the pyrotechnic tangents the plot line does take.  But for those who stay the course, the end is worth all we go through to  get there.
Come to think of it, that's the moral of the story.",958348800,2,2272,4.504926108374384
1076558,3,6305767866,"This movie has some problems, but it is entertaining enough to watch once.  First of all, Arnold is a better action star than he is an emotional character, that's one thing that doesn't work in this movie.
This movie  has a classic, theme:  good vs. evil, which has been done to  ""death.""  This movie pulls it off pretty well, with a cool  villian (the devel, you can't get much more evil than that.)

This will never find its way  into my top 10 list, but I thought there were enough original concepts to  keep my interested. I thought it was well written, and didn't go down the  cul-de-sac that many movies of the genre amble down, of relying too heavily  on special effects. Byrne delivers a solid performance, as does Arnold, (NO  attempt on the surname you notice!) who proves there is more to his  reportoire than 'I'll be back', which I had long suspected.

May not be  the best Arnold movie ever, nor qualify for an Oscar, but it is still very  entertaining and a good pass time.  It was also nice to see Arnold back in  action, and he looked good in this movie with his scruffy face.

1076563,4,6305767866,"This powerhouse is an expertly crafted supernatural action flick.  It is the story of Satan's attempt to rise and destroy the world as we know it by mating with a woman and producing an offspring.  We see the birth of the  chosen baby girl as the pope and cardinals, who have read the signs, plan  to find her and protect her from Satan.  The film jumps to the present and  we are introduced to Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and an adult  Christine York (Robin Tunney), Satan's intended.  The devil takes control  of an investment banker's body (Gabriel Byrne) and with the aid of his  sycophantic followers proceeds to stalk Christine for the mating ritual.  Meanwhile Jericho finds Christine and assigns himself as her protector.  The rest of the film is one big chase scene, as Jericho and Christine run  from Satan as well as the clerics who want to kill her to prevent the  union.
The story is pretty flimsy.  It is really nothing more than a  vehicle for Arnold to strap on some firepower and wreak mayhem in his  return to the action genre.  In the featurette included on the DVD, writer  Andrew Marlowe states flat out that he wrote this script specifically for  Arnold.  But WOW, as vehicles go, this was a supercharged nitro burning  dragster of a movie.
Peter Hyams puts together some of the best action  footage I can remember.  Overall, his photography was fantastically potent.  The technique, camera angles, lighting and use of filters to create  various effects were all terrific.  But more importantly, his pace was  excellent.  This film never lets up.  There are rest stops from the action,  but no real lulls.  The visual effects in this movie were outstanding.  There were pyrotechnics, digitally created creatures, and exploding models  that were so realistic that I didn't pick up they were models until I  checked out the bonus features on the DVD (The bonus pack was great.  It  included a fascinating section on how all the visual effects were  produced).  The sound design was also excellent (though a bit overly loud  at times) and made full use of all five speakers.
Schwarzenegger returns  to top form as undisputed king of the action genre.  There was much  speculation that, after his heart surgery, if he acted at all it he would  be relegated to nothing more strenuous than roles like `Kindergarten Cop'.  This film completely removes all doubt.  Arnold is pumped back up and takes  on his biggest challenge yet, in a physically demanding role fighting a foe  that can't be killed.  That doesn't mean he doesn't try, pouring out  projectiles like a fountainhead of fire.  This part was written in a way  that made Arnold's character a lot more human; actually fighting off  despair.  He handled this nuance extremely well.
This is probably Robin  Tunney's biggest part in a feature film and she does a nice job.  Her  character didn't have a lot of range; just look scared, upset and helpless  and make Arnold look strong.  She did this well, helped considerably by how  petite she is compared to Arnold.
I thought Gabriel Byrne took the wrong  approach to his character.  He is a terrific actor, but he played this role  a bit too flippantly, like a sardonic wise guy rather than the evil prince  of darkness.  Also, his New York accent was an awful attempt to hide his  charming Irish brogue.
Viewers should use discretion before seeing this  film.  Anyone who is put off by gratuitous graphic violence, gore, nudity,  profanity and sexual situations should avoid this film.  But this film is a  must see for action fans and especially for Arnold fans.  I rated it an  8/10 in spite of a weak story.",957484800,2,3642,4.748792270531401
1076649,4,6305767866,I was really shocked to see the man who was the priest in Stigmata play the devil in this movie. I think that these two movies actually compliment each other. I found Arnold to be good although I find it difficult to  relate to him as a normal person...which he plays in this movie. The  effects were good although there weren't many and the actor that played the  devil did an excellent job..although I think Pacino in Devil's Advocate is  still my favorite devil. I don't think this is the best movie ever made but  I did think it was entertaining..I believe it is worth watching and if you  liked Stigmata you should enjoy this although Stigmata was better.,957398400,,660,4.504201680672269
1076650,2,6305767866,"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Arnie and own most of his movies.  Okay, Arnold is not the greatest actor to ever grace the screen, but he usually makes great, suspend-disbelief-and-they-are-entertaining  movies.  Gabriel Byrne is a great actor and usually appears in good movies.  Kevin Pollack plays a side-kick as well as anyone and is good comic  relief.  Between the three of them, you would have hoped that one of them  would have read this script and said, ""Oh My God, this story is REALLY  BAD!""
The plot of this movie is predictable and so full of logical  holes that it makes one wonder if anyone actually wrote it or if they just  started filming a bunch of ""cool"" action and occult scenes and  thought putting it all together would make a good movie.  The Devil is  alternately brilliant and stupid.  Arnold somehow manages to outsmart the  Prince of Darkness and the New York Police Department, despite being an  alcoholic burn-out.  And, after watching this movie I am still confused as  to who Arnold and Kevin actually work for.  As for the number of the beast  being 999 instead of 666 and that being why Satan has to mate in 1999, I am  still confused as to what happened in the year 999.  Wouldn't that have  been the end of the thousand years they kept babling about in this movie?  Did the Devil run into an ancient version of Arnold and get his butt kicked  then, too?  And if so, why didn't he learn?
In addition to the cast  already mentioned, this movie also has other good actors who should have  known better.  Robin Tunney (great in ""The Craft""), Rod Stieger  (""On the Waterfront""), Anthony Fultz (""For Love of the  Game"") and CCH Pounder (""Face Off"") are all wasted in this  suprisingly bad movie.
Don't get me wrong.  I can suspend disbelief with  the best of them, and I know movies are supposed to be entertainment and  not reality.  But, at some level, the movie must make sense and fill in the  blanks.  This movie seems to be just a vehicle for Arnold to kick Satan's  ass.  That is not a good enough reason to see this film.
If you are a  true Arnie fan, you will see this anyway, despite the flaws (I did).  But,  it is not up to his usual quality, and is best rented first, before bought.  Caveat emptor.",957398400,26,2252,4.41421568627451
1076651,3,6305767866,"Overall, an action-packed, special-effects packed movie.  However, a little different than the typical Arnold movie.  First of all, it's darker than most of his movies.  Also, the movie tries to go a little deeper into Arnold's character than norm too.  Big mistake.  This requires ACTING.  I'm  sorry, Arnold just can't pull that sort of thing off.  The combo of Arnold  trying to do more than he can acting-wise, and some really bad overall  dialougue makes for 2 or 3 points in the movie where there is unintended  laughter.  Not good. This time around, Arnold is fighting the Devil  himself.  How do you fight the ultimate bad guy?  Well, of course, with  bigger guns! But, if you like Arnold, and like big time special effects,  it's cool.",957225600,,744,4.777777777777778
1076652,3,6305767866,"The DVD case tells you that this film is ""more chilling than The Exorcist ... more haunting than The Sixth Sense..."" I think it is totally wrong to compare this movie to either.
End of Days is a good shoot 'em up film with great effects and a powerful story. I did not find  it chilling (or really scary) but I was gripped.
Arnie plays a burnt out  special forces guy (who feels guilty about the death of his wife and  children) who gets embroiled in protecting a girl who has been marked for  consummation by Satan. Arnie does what Arnie does best: shooting, blowing  things up and being tough (but this character has a little more depth and  vulnerability than his other guises).
Gabriel Byrne does a great turn as  Satan. Ok it is nothing like Pacino's attempt but it is convincingly  downplayed. Robin Tunney seems to have grown up a lot since The Craft and  portays the object of Satan's lust in a suitably bewildered and tearful  manner.
The Devil has one night to impregnate a girl and bring on a  thousand years of darkness. The Church are prepared to kill the girl. The  religious twists are not really entered into in any depth but they are  there as a backdrop to what is essentially an action film.
Definitely  worth seeing, (especially the Devil's temptation of Jericho: the Arnie  character) but do not be caught up in the hype. You might jump a couple of  times but if you want to be really scared watch something else.",957225600,,1434,4.478764478764479

Yes there are some unbelievable things in it, but what do you expect from an Arnold movie?  These movies aren't made to  analyze and prod over every single mistake, they are made to sit back and  marvel at the spectacular special effects.  I decided to give this four  stars after seeing it for the third time.....the movie really grew on  me.
  Possibly my favorite part of this whole DVD is the two rarely  seen music videos by Everlast and Rob Zombie.  Just another reason to buy  DVD insted of VHS.  Also the sound quality is great, you can hear every  little piece of cement fall when Arnold is in the Church.  Overall a great  DVD!",957139200,13,724,4.363636363636363
1076654,5,6305767866,"I've just finished watching this movie; I am still shocked at how good this film actually is.  After reading many less than appreciative reviews about this movie, I approached it warily.  However, within the first few  minutes I knew that this film was going to offer something different, a new  approach to action.  Firstly I would like to make it clear that this is not  a typical corny Arnie movie(although to me as a great fan, this is not a  bad thing) as I have heard it condemned as on many occasions.  Really it is  more a horror movie given the action treatment, and Arnie actually refrains  from making too many of his famous one-liners.
Although the plot has  been the source of some critisicism, I actually found it intriguing;  although films about the ""end of days"" may not be an entirely  original concept, the way in which this film portrays that concept is.  It  is simply a classic good versus evil story, modernised for todays  action/horror audience.
Another very positive aspect of the film is the  script.  This often seems to be the last thing that makers of action flicks  seem to be concerned with, with End of Days this is not the case. Although  there may be a valid argument to say that Arnies character and the  interaction of other characters in the film are just cliche's, parodies of  so many other films, i.e. suicidal, drunken ex cop who lost family, teams  up with a  beautiful, vulnerable young woman etc.  However, I believe that  the characters work well with the premise of the movie, and that this isn't  just an unimaginative ""cop out"" by the script writer.
I  actually think this is one of Arnie's best movies, up there with classics  such as Predator, Terminator, Total Recall, Commando and The Running Man.  This film signals a return to form and a new sophistication in action for  one of the greatest action heroes of our time.  The Dvd is complimentary to  the film, offering an all round good package.  The 5.1 sound track is  amazing, handling both the low frequency explosions and the more detailed  intricacies of the movie equally adeptly.  The dark, moody visuals of the  movie also appear sharp, giving great picture clarity. This movie is simply  a must to all dvd owners.",957139200,,2227,4.670984455958549
1076655,4,6305767866,"Irrespective of where you are, I have the funny feeling that this film is made fun of or ridiculed by the general public & the critics.  One thing about critics is they are paid to criticise movies.  For that simple  reason, I watched the movie anyway.  Arnie just got better with age.  Even  though there's still an element of accent in his command of English, his  acting ability is improving comparing with his Conan the Barbarian day.  A  lot of people are mocking fun of the story  line but why should we take a  movie that seriously?  Isn't that the purpose of going to movie is to  escape from reality?  In terms of entertainment factor, it's superb with  plenty of actions & sarcastic jokes.  Arnie gave us a superb  performance & so does Gabriel Bryne (a very different role from his  other movie touching on spirituality, Stigmata).  Well, credit also have to  be given to Peter Hyams, the action director who had also directed Van  Damme in TimeCop.  Highly recommended especially for Arnie's fan.",956966400,,1008,4.672413793103448

1076657,5,6305767866,"If you are interested in religion and psychology, this movie is a must see. We should be regularly reminded about reality and presence of evil (our collective dark side), and in this film the Devil is portrayed  brilliantly (by Gabriel Burns) as a very real creature. But the movie has  other redeeming features. For me, who grow up in the Communist country, the  Masonic knights in this film, or ""good guys"" who wanted to clean the earth  from evil, by killing the girl, make a lot of sense.  Their coat of arms (a  sword and a heart) reminded me of the coat of arms of the KGB - Soviet  secret police or the ""militant knights"" of the Communist party. Also the  resemblance of the erroneous idea that by killing the girl (a soul) we can  protect ourselves from the invasion of evil to our hearts to the idea of  the Communists that they can swipe the earth clean from the social evils  and build an artificial, but ""good"" society. For them the delivering the  humankind from evil is an obsession and the ultimate goal, even if it leads  to the destruction of souls. Look at the lopsided masculinity of the  totalitarian societies! The Devil is very real, he is a part of life, and  can't be conquered by violence and destruction (which he wants and we  sometimes instinctually desire), but only by faith, patience and  self-knowledge - the forces of light. That was, I thought, a central idea  of this great movie.",956880000,,1415,4.5476190476190474

I will also agree  with another reviewer in that this film is not for children ( or teens )  since there are some disturbing imagery.

1076727,2,6305767866,"End of Days could've been terrific.  I mean, what other actor would you rather pit against Satan than Ahnuld?  However, the story ruins what could've been a great film.  Arnold, shadowing what Stallone did in  Copland, tries to turn in a deep and enthralling performance.  However,  it's just so hard to get past the fact that a huge Austrian man just  happens to be around in America and fighting crime.  Besides this, Arnold  doesn't have the acting capacity to give the role what it could've been in  more capable hands.  He is extremely commanding and does give a so-so  performance, but he is not exactly one of our great acting talents.  Gabriel Byrne, however, is a pure delight as Satan.  He is viscious and  superb in an over the top performance.  As expected, the film is extremely  violent, and at some times for no good reason.  This just goes along with  the rest of the ill-conceived story.  Sudden thoughts just come to people  at the right time, and this takes away from the film.  People getting  sudden realizations just tends to make the film tidier.  Also, the special  effects, while being quite nifty, have been seen before, so it kind of  takes away from this.  How many different ways can you show a building  exploding?  Not many.  This film could've been terrific if it had a better  and more thought out story.  The darkness and tone in the film is just  right and the action is nonstop, but there are just too many plot holes to  avoid.

Arnold this  time around plays a burned out cop turned security officer named Jericho  who discovers that a young woman is targeted to be the mother of Satan's  spawn.  Satan as it turns out has taken the body of a man played by Gabriel  Byrnne-(who I think made a great villian.) who Arnold was assigned to  protect early on.  What the movie eventually boils down to- after a couple  of grizzly crucifixons, religous questioning and shooting scenes, is Arnold  playing beat the clock with Satan by trying to keep the girl (Robin Tunney)  safe from Satan's grasp until midnight on New Years Eve, for if Arnie is  successful, Satan cannot return for another 1000 years.  Overall if you can  take the religous scenes with a grain of salt, (I don't know how much of it  is real or not) and also expect to see Arnold on a bad day and not up to  snuff with his older, better self say as in ERASER or TERMINATER 2, you  should do okay with this movie.

Be warned however; this film is INTENSE and not for children, with references to and images of  Satanism, representatives of a fringe group of Catholics trying to pin a  girl down in order to stab and kill her, the devil having sex with 2 women,  and some awfully gruesome murders.
A previous reviewer gave away the  ending for this film (Thanks alot for ruining it for me, whoever you are)  so I won't give it away again. I rented it with the worst expectations  possible, and was surprised to discover that I liked it.  Not something  that I would want to buy or see more than once but I enjoyed it!  Better  than ""Eraser"", ""Last Action Hero"" ""Batman And  Robin"" (but what wasn't better than that stinker?) and some of  Schwarzenegger's earlier films, but not as good as ""T2"" or  ""True Lies"". I don't know what else to write, without giving too  much away.",956361600,68,1053,4.468421052631579
1076784,2,6305767866,"In 1999 , a prophecy is fortold that the dark angel is loose from his prison. But leave it to the hero to challenge satan. In the ultimate war of good vrs evil. A very rugged Arnold who is  battling personal problems  diffrent than anything hes ever done,but a lack luster script and formula  action kills this movie off. Good options but you  don't just get a movie  for the options just not one of his best but a fun movie to watch rent it  don't buy it.",956361600,,456,4.125
1076785,1,6305767866,"After losing $7 and two hours of my life seeing this at the theatre it is time to get petty revenge/vent.  This movie contains another typical ""action"" plot that is predictable and full of dull characters.  This can be balanced out with great action which this movies lacks. The  acting is...well nevermind.  The dialogue is unintentionally funny, but  that does not justify owning this movie.  The real tragedy here is Gabriel  Byrne, who is the man, in a horrid movie. If you really NEED to see a  supernatural type of movie see The Sixth Sense again or take a nap.  To sum  it up over the hill action hero, bad script, no action, good trailer and  marketing= every bad HOLLYWOOD movie.  On the plus side the explosions  sound good.",956361600,2,734,4.596899224806202

1076787,1,6305767866,"What a piece of garbage this was, I'm glad I didn't go to the theater. Not even the action sequences are at least, of the same level of ones in other Arnold's movies. Rent it if you can, cause it doesn't worth the money it costs buying it.",956188800,3,239,4.0
1076788,1,6305767866,"This is one of the second worst Arnold movie I have ever seen - the worst being ""Last action hero"".  Messy, senseless, illogical plot and gratuitous violence are major disappointments.  Arnold has not put out  quality film since T2 and True Lies.  Don't bother with renting this film -  just wait until it show up on HBO or Cinemax.",956188800,3,332,4.559322033898305
1076789,1,6305767866,"When this film came out I thought great.  I always been an Arnold fan, but boy was I wrong.  I wasted 6.50 on a real sleaper.  The only guy who made the movie ok enough not to snore in the theater was the guy who played  satan.  From the numerous things that made this movie sad was the Bible  ignorance.  The taking out of scriptures was real bad.",956188800,2,348,4.029411764705882
1076790,1,6305767866,"It's a shame to give only one star to a film which obviously took a lot of time, effort, talent and money to create. But whoever induced Schwarzenegger into this one served him badly.  His role calls for him to  be both an action hero and a sensitive, conflicted protagonist.  Regarding  the former, he becomes more a punching bag in successive scenes of  gratuitious violence (though somewhat less gory, thankfully, than they  might have been).  And his portrayal of the ""sensitive"" aspects  falls flat.  It comes across as a parody of Arnold.  Maybe that was the  intent?
The best character in the film is Gabriel Byrne's Satan.  His  Lucifer at least delivers some humorous wry cynicism.  The viewer finds  himself almost rooting for him vice Arnold.
The film's premise is not  implausible as entertainment:  ""The Omen"" pulled it off well.  The film's flaw is its execution.  The makers just could not tear  themselves away from gratuitous violence, obscuring the plot line, and from  excessive even if well-done special effects for the sake of special  effects.  And perhaps the saddest thing is the directoral and cast comments  in the DVD extras.  They really thought they were producing something  novel, significant and worthwhile.  Hollywood inbreeding - how disconnected  they are, what hubris.
Lastly, I have a good home theater system and  the sound on the DVD appeared to be lacking in the very deep bass.  Deep  down percussive punch was absent.  The sound was better, in fact, in the  actor, director, and special effects commentary extras on the DVD than  during the film itself.  Go figure.",956188800,4,1607,4.958333333333333
1076791,1,6305767866,"This movie started OK and then degenerated into a bunch of Action/Horror cliches Which left me fast forwarding to the end. By the end of this movie you don't care if the good guy's win, or die.",956188800,,193,4.243243243243243
1076792,5,6305767866,"Spectacular film. Only Arnie can perform in actions that good, The film is fantastic and I thing it is a must have film. I thing as long as Arnie do Action films all the others comes second.",956188800,,190,4.162162162162162
1076793,5,6305767866,"The picture is excellent, the sound is excellent, and the features are comprehensive. The story is....er...well I guess you can't have everything. The plot is kind of silly, there's no denying that. They have an adequate  explanation for the date thing I guess, if you can suspend your disbelief  long enouph. Get this, 2000 years ago a group of monks calculated (with  what an abacus?) the position the stars needed to be in for Satan's return.  Of course, makes sense to me. I have no idea how they would even know the  alignment of the stars, let alone their trajectories, but ok. The look of  the film is fabulous. Rich earth tones saturate every scene so that the  whole film feels like hell. Gabrial Byrne is awesome as Satan, and that new  girl is ok. Arnold is,well...Arnold. He's big, he's cool, he can't act his  way out of a wet paper bag. But we don't care! Look, the special effects  are cool, the action sequences are neat, and I really liked the end. This  was a good film and presented respectfully on this DVD.",956102400,,1027,4.5271739130434785
1076834,4,6305767866,"I feel that Arnold did a great job with this movie! It makes you think about the way you are living- does Satan try & get you on his side?  If you are religous, you will be scared watching this movie, I was very powerfully moved by this movie even though it was not real it made me  rethink my religion & beliefs. Hollywood made you think about God &  the devil. I think it is a must see for all!  Very good flick!",955843200,9,414,3.892857142857143
1076835,4,6305767866,"this movie was straight for the most part since schwarzenegger is so hardcore in about all of his action movies but it was still foul that satan did some of the things that he did. while the best moment was clearly when  schwarzenegger was hanging from that window ledge and satan offered to help  him if he gave over the girl. arnold said ""alright"" but when  satan reached his arm down far enough to reach, arnold reached up, grabbed  satan's shoulder yelling ""f___ you! "" and threw satan out onto  the street. it just sounds kinda funny when arnold swears cause of his  accent. but the most disturbing thing was when satan crucified the priest  to the ceiling and carved a message in his chest with a scalpel. nasty. the  only other complaint that i have is that arnold shouldnt've died at the  end. i don't care if it is satan of whoever else. arnold schwarzenegger is  too hardcore to die, especially in action films. the way that end of days  concluded was disappointing. they should've kept the original ending with  arnold blasting satan back to hell with earthly firepower. even though it  wouldnt've made much sense, when exactly to arnold movies actually make  much sense? blowing satan back to hell with firepower would've been much  better and therefore made arnold look much better and maybe the movie  would've been able to stay in theaters for just a little bit longer than it  did. maybe someday we'll get to see the original ending. this movie wasn't  exactly the best thing that arnold's ever done but is an ok installment to  a dynamite career of arnold's. i'd only recommend this to loyal fans of  arnold schwarzenegger. if you can tolerate ""junior"" and  ""jingle all the way"" and even ""batman and robin"" then  you'll probably enjoy this one.",955497600,,1761,4.686274509803922

1076841,4,6305767866,"It was nice to see Arnold make a comeback in an Action/Thriller. He gives his usual grid-iron performance. A big suprise was Byrnes performance as Satan. If you doubt it, you won't after that first scene where he was taken  over by Lucifer. CGI was very good, sound was great and the sets were dark.  The only hole I was left with was from a slighty disappointing ending.  Still it is well worth adding to the Arnold Collection.",953164800,4,428,4.461538461538462
1076842,1,6305767866,"Talk about every single element a movie can screw up on.  All aspects were poorly executed.  The script was full of flaws, and was bland and uninteresting.  The acting was ludicrous.  I love Gabriel Byrne and he did  a decent job, but he doesn't save the movie.  The directing was so horrible  I was actually laughing.  Cheap, lightning quick editing used in a  completely wrong way.  Peter Hyams's last film, 'The Relic', wasn't bad but  seriously lacked.  But this film is just awful.  The special effects were  ok for awhile, but they actually got worse as the movie progressed.  There  are a couple of good shots, but they are buried among a heap of complete  idiocy.  I'll never get those two hours back.  Don't make the same mistake.",952819200,11,739,4.6328125

So to all you critics and wanna be critics out there, don't quit your day job. Arnold  was, is, and always will be the greatest action star in the history of  American cinema, bar none. This movie was awesome. Action,  explosions,cursing, and of course Arnolds famous one-liners. What more  could you want in a movie. If you don't buy this movie, or at least rent it,  your really cheating yourself. Hopefully Arnold will continue to make movies  as great as ""End of Days"", if not, there are no other action  films worth seeing.",952387200,5,662,4.559322033898305
