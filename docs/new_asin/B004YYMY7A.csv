8449042,5,B004YYMY7A,"Another wonderful Russian film unknown in the United states.  Ir seems a mix of three or four Anderson tales but all  are well done. The bookends are the original story.

A young prince starts out on a quest for his princess and has three  totally different adventures.  All three princesses are gorgeous and totally different from each other. The story about the second one, the dark princess, is the most enjoyable but all are wonderfully presented. And since there are four stories there is no padding in any of them. As so often happens, the young prince finds his true love in his own back yard.
.

The scenery is gorgeous and the glorious Vivaldi background music fits like a  velvet glove. Adults will enjoy this as well as children.",1417305600,,740,4.6461538461538465
