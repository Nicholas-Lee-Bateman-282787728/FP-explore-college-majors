If you want to see a sexy thriller about a happening guy, successful at his job and with the adoring attention of women, then watch Cruel Game. I truly did not know what would happen next, who was betraying who, what the characters' real motives were, and how it would all end up as I was watching it. By the time you reach the end, it all makes sense and is satisfying. And the hero was a smart guy, not someone easily duped. But the web of treachery and deceit is woven so well, not even he could see into the hearts and minds of everyone around him. The fewer plot details I mention, the better, as I wouldn't want to spoil any of it for you. Just let it be known you will be guessing in a good way about who is out to get who. If you think you won't relate to a guy who seems to have everything, keep watching - even he realizes the greatest values in life are true love, trust, loyalty, and truth.

Masashi Nagadoi does a great job in constructing a story where you are lured into a feeling of comfort, only to become gradually more unsettled as time goes on. Then, just like the hero, you will be looking over your shoulder wondering what is really going on and who will be coming after you next. And it was great to see the late Mako in a role, albeit small. Check it out!",1430265600,,1293,4.106719367588933

8017275,1,B0001WTVBQ,"...this movie would put anyone to sleep and that of course is its main problem.  A Japanese film made in America, CRUEL GAME has little plot and unconvincing, although, attractive actors.  Adam Barrata stars as a handsome, washboard-abbed ad exec who is sleeping with all kinds of women and finds himself falling for a lovely Japanese girl who showers him with presents.  Mako makes an appearance as a philosophical, euphemism spouting gardener, and Damien Valencia is Pedro, another hedonistic male with little substance.  The women, including a painfully unattractive Jennifer Rubin, are all eye candy and the movie's snail pace makes it painful to watch.  Avoid unless you really need something to put you to sleep.",1116374400,2,718,5.155172413793103
8017276,2,B0001WTVBQ,"Cruel Game is an R-rated B-movie snoozer.. I mean, thriller, starring Adam Baratta (who?), Mako (from M*A*S*H rerun fame), and Playboy Playmates Carrie Stevens and Victria (the ending credits left the 'o' out of Victoria's name :) ) Silvstedt.
Adam plays a pathetic millionaire, by inheritance, ad exec (...)
Carrie Stevens plays a cold-hearted and rude (boy, big stretch there.. yes, I've met her) alcoholic love interest of Adam's.
Along comes Jennifer Tung who captures his heart and possibly more than that.  Jennifer also happens to be Carrie's roommate.  They're both in a relationship with Adam but who is being more honest with him?
Usually a movie with more than one Playboy playmate in it, especially a b-movie, has quite a bit of nudity in it.  But, even with Carrie, Victoria, and another Playboy model, Bonnie-Jill Laflin, all you get out of this one outside of the nauseous acting, is a brief topless and (...)view of Carrie Stevens.

The downside of Victoria is that she keeps her clothes on and her mouth open.  Yes, it's rude to say, but I'm trying to save you from this torcher.
Movie warnings: profanity, all too brief nudity, overdramatic fake orgasms on Carrie's part, 'knee deep in it' all men are scum message throughout the movie, pathetic attempt at acting by the director, and an overly predictable script.
This dvd would be best used as a drink coaster.",1081728000,13,1380,4.880341880341881
