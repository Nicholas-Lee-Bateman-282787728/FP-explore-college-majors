2260596,5,B00092A1J4,"Of course I loved the series when it first aired so it's no surprised I loved the DVD too.

I really enjoy the lead character, Amanda!  She is beautiful, elegant, dangerous, and more than a little eccentric!

I also liked the variation on the Highlander theme, of using an immortal female as the lead.  And I thought she looked great during the sword fighting. ( I just wished there was a little more of that)

I enjoyed the whole romance thing they've added with Nick Wolf, a mortal man.  But then I'm a sucker for romance.

I totally disagree with the above review that claims there was no chemistry between the leads. I felt and saw a connection on screen - which I guess means they were professional actors in spite of the fact they didn't get along off camera.

And lets remember extreme dislike creates heat too.

I thought the interviews were a total hoot! I absolutely loved them!

You listen with your jaw on the floor, you really do!

I couldn't believe how honest everyone was about how bad the atomsphere was on the set.  I don't think I've ever heard anything quite like it!

The interveiws made this worth the purchase price for me!

But I loved the series and I really wish they could have had at least one season more...

There IS a big reveal in the last episode and I would have loved to see what a new season would bring to the characters Amanda and Nick.

But the actors would have killed each other if it had!",1120521600,17,1430,4.359848484848484
2260597,1,B00092A1J4,"I purchased this set prior to general release from the Highlander site and was excited to view the one season of the Highlander ""universe"" I hadn't seen. Unfortunately...it's a dud! The plots center more around police-type drama shoving the immortal aspects to the background; there is no chemistry between the two lead actors, and only Amanda's presence makes the show watchable. What disturbed me the most were the ""Jerry Springer segments"" that were included on each disk describing how petty and childish everybody remotely associated with the show appear to be! I mean really!! I kept waiting for the punchline, the ""just kidding folks!"" that never came. Why exactly should I care about Elizabeth's ""sociopathic"" boyfriend, her night with Clinton, her paranoia? Why do I care about people not getting paid what they wanted or not getting enough camera time? The frenchman who did the score was terrible....so, why did they keep him? And, why do I care again? The worst part though was the hammering away on the point of how the two lead actors hated each other...boy, really made me buy into the relationship between their characters. All in all, this was the worst thing I've purchased on DVD....save your money and buy a series of quality!",1119916800,6,1246,4.966507177033493
2260598,4,B00092A1J4,"Okay, it may not be as good as the original Highlander series or any of the movies, but the Raven does have it's place.  I'm like on disc 4 now and so far I have not really been disappointed.  The production value seems kinda low, considering this was only shot maybe 5 or 6 years ago.  Hercules and Xena were in production before this and their production value was quite high, so I don't see why this one was not.  Maybe they spent most of the money shooting on location in Canada (LOL).  Anyway, so far, the series has been entertaining.  If you like Highlander at all, you will get this too.",1119571200,3,595,4.267857142857143
2260599,1,B00092A1J4,"First thing, Amanda as the star? In the original series she was weak, selfish, unmoral and had to be saved by Duncan atleast 3 times! We never really got to see her fight because Duncan saved her! The original series writers self destructed the series so there wasn't really anywhere to go with this season. Where do they get Amanda being a Raven and a highlander. She was born in the highlands but moved soon after. It is absolutely boring, and all it does is tring to ride the coattails of Duncan and Connor. I highly do not reccomend this season, for the new fan of highlander nor for those of us who have followed the Highlander from the beginning.",1118707200,4,652,4.441666666666666

2260604,2,B00092A1J4,"Lightning doesn't strike twice. Amanda is a perfect foil / side character...she comes in disrupts the Highlander's stabile life, throws in fun, sexuality and chaos and exits gracefully.

That which I find irksome:

A) They should've stuck with the ""Immortal just trying to survive The Game"" theme but from a woman's point of view...that might've worked for an irresponsible, fun loving character like Amanda... but they didn't

 B) Why did they not MAKE her change her hair back?!? Or change the name to something other than that which implies 'raven haired beauty'?

 C) This needs some continuity...Joe, Adam, MacLeod, a guest appearance here and there from friend or foe, SOMETHING to tie this to the Highlander series. I never even finished the series and quite frankly, the behind the scenes is more intriguing than the show.",1453507200,2,830,5.0661764705882355

Otherwise, this may have lasted longer if they stuck to that and maybe had guest appearances from Adrian Paul and Peter Winfield. The only thing I like about this is the end when the cop she loves becomes immortal. Other than that, I can barely give this more than a single star.",1421798400,2,453,4.404761904761905

2260614,3,B00092A1J4,"I have never had such a difficult time watching something Highlander...I love all the movies for the most part and the Series but this was really hard to watch and it shouldnt have been.  The whole show just looks and feels really cheap, gone is the catchy Queen theme song, the action is really lacking, and the flashback sequences are not very strong when they happen.  As many have stated its very curious because this should have been the show that revived the franchise after the Season 6 debacle but instead in the first 6 or 7 episodes they backed off from the successful Highlander formula that was seasons 1-5 and experimented with something that shouldnt have been messed with which gave the rest of the series a bad rep.  I was really looking forward to a show about Amanda, I think she is a wonderful character and when you have been an immortal for 1000 years there is so much story you can delve into, and instead we got a Sci fi Crime show.  Not saying I have a problem with Crime shows but when I think Highlander I don't think Crime show I think Immortals, sword fights, historical flashbacks, and fantasy....not this.  I give it three stars because the show is okay but just okay, after about episode 6 it starts going back to the original formula which I liked but unfortunately the damage had already been done.  Its too bad because the rest of the show ended up being pretty bearable.

Also as many have already stated its pretty difficult but entertaining to watch the featurettes, but it really does feel like a therapy session for the cast and crew.  Advice on what not to do if you are creating a TV show.",1416528000,,1630,4.483108108108108

2260617,3,B00092A1J4,"This series has Nostalgic value to me.  I watched it from pilot to finale.  It was my introduction to the Highlander Saga. Afterwards I watched all the movies and the re-runs of the original series.

Throughout the series Nick gets a strong education about the immortals and their world.  That made the show perfect for a novice viewer.  As Nick's knowledge evolved so did my own.

Amanda and Nick had chemistry and were an interesting pair.  Amanda is a great character, but she's not meant to be a main character - she is not a star.  Nick was the Hero of the series, but he needed Amanda to keep him alive - the immortals were more than he could handle.  Amanda was a good fighter, but she's not a Warriores.  All the fights she got into in this series didn't make sense - that didn't suit her character.

No one in this show is actually a ""Highlander"".  Amanda and Joe Dawson are the only links to the original series.  This series lead me to become a Highlander fan, but it didn't do much for the Highlander Saga.

2260622,2,B00092A1J4,"After years of telling myself I was never going to do it, I finally broke down and watched the Highlander spin-off, The Raven.

Following the adventures of the character Amanda from the original show this spin-off has to be one of the worst out there.

The acting, the writing and even the music are horrendous. The idea of combing a ""cop"" show with the Highlander franchise was just plain lame. (not to mention lazy)

The main actors have a much talent in them as Pauly Shore's turd

The writing is so bad, it makes America's Funniest Home Videos look like an award winning comedy. Why Mythos was never given his own spin-off show instead and down right mind-breaking.

The only good thing I can say about this show is that I now appreciate Season 6 of Highlander SO much more than I used to",1398384000,,792,4.472222222222222
2260623,5,B00092A1J4,"I just finished this series & was very disappointed that it ended when there was so much more potential for a third season & more..
I always liked Amanda's character when she guest starred on Highlander. She had a great chemistry with Adrian Paul & was the only female  who could match him in every way & usually got the better of him lol. She was a very interesting immortal & Elizabeth Gracen breathed life into her character.
She was an unapologetic immortal. No angst or wringing of the hands, ""oh, how terrible it is, I don't want to be an immortal any longer"", etc. She made the most of her immortality.
If I had not watched the extras, I would never have known about Elizabeth's feelings toward Paul Johannson. They had a great chemistry on screen. I also didn't agree with some of the writers & producers opinions regarding the show. There was a lot of conflict going on behind the scenes which resulted in the show's demise.

2260636,5,B00092A1J4,"First of all, why did this series end up only lasting around half a season on network TV, even though a full season of episodes was actually filmed? After viewing the entire season, I'd say that considering their overall quality, it's really a shame they didn't reach a wider audience. But the show aired at a really odd time, at least in the Midwest (early Saturday afternoon), so you really had to break up your day to watch it. As such, it was well nigh impossible to catch the drift of where the series was heading.
And gee whiz, the 'stock' trailer at the beginning of each episode was so very, very cheesy sounding.

I should probably mention that Amanda's extremely short, bleached blonde hair made her head look too small for the rest of her body, which is silly, considering all the devoted fans from the former Highlander series were used to seeing her done up in her full glory. In well over 20 episodes of the original series, she wore her hair many different ways, using this particular coiffure one time only.

Also, why is she ""the Raven"" when her hair is practically white? The idea of the raven is only briefly alluded to in one episode of the entire series, certainly not enough to warrant the quasi-mythic, or should we really say pseudo-mythic significance given to it in the aforementioned cheesy trailer. The writing for that speech (""She is immortal . . ."") is atrociously bad, almost nonsensical, and the man who reads it aloud in a flamboyantly pseudo-macho manner is definitely wrong for the part. Was this supposed to be some kind in in-joke? Maybe he thought Amanda was really China (the pro wrestler/personality seen on UPN) whom he was introducing. Whatever the rationale, it certainly didn't work very well.

But know that if you watch the Raven series from beginning to end, it's really quite remarkable. I think that sometimes the stories themselves tend toward more subtlety than the 6 seasons with Duncan McLeod, though the original series to its credit seemed somehow, what, more spacious and cosmopolitan? Here, though, there are less sword-fights per episode, and of course less 'quickenings'. (Amanda's quickenings have a feminine flavor to them whereas Duncan's often seemed rather wooden, maybe trying to flirt with the aforementioned pro wrestling audience.)

Possibly the biggest problem with the original series was a technical one: when scenes occurred in relatively darker surroundings, you had to jack up the brightness and tint of your monitor screen - though then everything looked too blue, and even then often you couldn't see what was going on. Thankfully, this technical oversight was corrected for the 'Raven' episodes.

Series star Elizabeth Gracen as Amanda was a frequent guest on episodes in Highlander: the Series' first 5 seasons, and a full-fledged co-star during its final season. She is a former Miss America who put her prize money to excellent use by going to acting school. Here she gets to show her own ample ability rather than merely playing the part of comedic and romantic foil to Adrian Paul's character Duncan McLeod (even there she was a very popular personage, gaining numerous loyal and devoted fans - check out her own website). In the earlier series, she often came off rather quirky, almost a mere appendage - of course not so here. During the Raven series, the gradual moral and emotional development of her own character works in tandem with the slowly developing/deepening friendship with her co-star (the former policeman, turned private detective, turned hi-grade security operative Nick Wolfe). It's really a tour de force in terms of believable acting and directing. Maybe even more so than for the original series, I was never tempted, once I got a few episodes into it, to want to turn the TV off, other than to eat, sleep, and go to work.

Though you could see where the series could have continued after the last episode (a second season, anyone?!) it also was emotionally a good place for it to end or at least go into hiatus. Although, maybe if you'd not already seen the 6 seasons of the original series, this wouldn't be the case.

Duncan's prolific and beautiful ramblings into far eastern religions and martial arts forms, as well as the little proverbs that emerge here and there from the mouths of different immortals (and mortals), both friends and foes, aren't present here as much, at least not in such a dressed-up form. Amanda's wisdom displays itself more in fits and starts (sometimes very passionate), but that makes this all the more believable, as viewers see that she's not just a clone of McLeod. The wonderfully diverse nature of the many different characters in the original series was a major factor as to why it was so stellar. To their credit, the writers, directors and producers did their best to preserve that tradition of excellence.

The only character (besides of course Amanda) who here reprises his role from the original series is the 'Watcher' Joe Dawson, though only for one episode. Valentine Pelka (the evil immortal Kronos in several episodes of the original series) and Philip Akin (who co-starred as Duncan's friend and employee Charlie throughout season #3) guest in a couple or so of the Raven episodes, portraying different characters than they played originally.",1292544000,,5297,4.917225950782997

2260640,3,B00092A1J4,"This was an interesting series, and I remember watching several episodes when they first came out.  However, I didn't see the entire series.  I'm not sure whether I lost interest, or they just stopped broadcasting the episodes.

I liked the premise of a thief meeting up with a cop soon to be ex-cop.  They had a lot of interesting episodes, and the best were set in the States.  Once they moved to Paris, and lost Amanda's roommate, the series changed.  All the episodes sounded the same.  Amanda meets person from her past, that killed: lover, friend, etc.  She reluctantly wants revenge.  Daries from the Highlander is replaced by another immortal, Liam (I think).

Unfortunately, the constant whining during the interview series by everyone, with maybe the exception of Johannson took away what little interest we had in the series.  As far as I know, Paul Johannson is the only one that still has a career in the business.  While the interview on the first disk was interesting, they should have just stuck with that interview and moved it to the last disk.  Going on an on about how bad the rift between Gracen and Johannson was did nothing but diminish this dvd series.",1256428800,2,1176,4.733990147783251
2260641,2,B00092A1J4,"I just watched all six seasons of ""Highlander""; and because I enjoyed the Amanda character, I was really looking forward to ""The Raven.""

This is a surprisingly mediocre, disappointing series. The production values seem nearly equal to that of the parent show -- so it isn't that. (Although I will say that the music STUNK.)

No: The writing is stunningly unimaginative. The dialogue is forced, contrived, positively tortured, as Amanda and Nick do the same adversarial dance through every episode. The tone is repetitiously argumentative, just a plot device, even when there is NOTHING for these two characters to argue about. They might as well have been shouting, ""Have some damn coffee!"" ""OK, I'll have some damn coffee, so what!"" ""Do you want cream and sugar, shut up!""  It was that meaningless.

It never rises above the level of Lucy-and-Ricky... except that once in a while, Lucy gets a pouty look on her face and chops someone's head off.

It may have been the fault of the writing, or the woeful lack of chemistry between Amanda and Nick -- but the end product makes it seem as though she couldn't carry a leading role, and he couldn't manage the sidekick one. Truthfully, I never thought of Adrian Paul as Oscar-award-winning material, but he MUST have been, to carry Gracen all those years.

I'm only half a dozen episodes into the series, and already I find myself wandering away into the kitchen to wash dishes. The storylines are almost unbearably tedious. In some episodes, like ""Crime and Punishment,"" there's barely an immortal element present; Amanda is entirely incidental. It's as though somebody wrote a bad cop shoot-em-up, and then Elizabeth Gracen happened to wander through the set.

By the way -- whose decision was Amanda's short white hair?  The show's called ""The Raven,"" right? Wouldn't her (previous) black hair have been more appropriate -- and flattering? Honey -- unless you are Mia Farrow and this is ""Peyton Place,"" short white hair just makes a woman look OLD.

And speaking of OLD: Isn't Amanda boasting of an extra 200 years, since the last time we saw her with Duncan? I've heard of women lying about their age to make themselves seem younger... but older??  Also -- what is this ""need a violent death to trigger immortality"" stuff? I may be mistaken, but wasn't Amanda's own original death, from the plague?

And don't tell me: Nick's going to turn out to be immortal, right? If I'm wrong, I'll return to this review and admit it. But I suspect that's a cliche that will be irresistible for these writers. They wouldn't want to let beefcake like THAT get old, would they? (The entertainment industry's fondest dream: Handsome, AND lives forever!)

What a disappointment this must have been, for all the original ""Highlander"" production people working on it. My sympathies, guys. I'll see the series through to the end; then go back and watch some REAL ""Highlander,"" to cleanse my palate.",1255478400,4,2929,4.883064516129032

It was on very late at night in my area, and I was only able to catch it a few times.  When the show disapeared I was sourly disapointed.

Fast forward 10 years.  In a moment of Nostalgia I find this here on Amazing and make the purchase.  My memories are there and the over all story line is still compelling... A thief who can't die, and a man of integrity trying to influence her to do good.

What I can say abouut this series is first, I must have seen all the good episodes back in 1998, and missed the bad.  Watching the series from start to finish was a confusing and somewhat irritating experience.  There's still that hint of sophistication, and some of the stories are well thought out and written.  The cast, whatever thier personal feelings for each other in real life, play well together and the acting is good.  THe chemistry between the love interests is a little sparce, but could be over looked.

My main issue with the series is that after the first few episodes, flip... The who feel changes.  Then again later on.  It's like the series could never find it's identity... or at least the writers didn't seem to know how to hold an essence of where they wanted this to go or feel.  I have watched the commentary on the DVD, and there was a lot of behind the scenes b.s. that didn't seem to help matters.  One thing that is dumbfounding for me is how they couldn't pay to keep the side kick charecter Lucy, but were able to pay to transport everyone to France.  Also one minute showing Amanda as the witty, smart, thief with a taste for the High Life, and suddenly we're trying to make her a virginal savior who was some sort of female Robinhood / Florence Nightengale.

In looking back you can truly see how much potential this series seriously had.  Moreover the fan base was already there from the Highlander Series.  It's really sad to see how politics and mishandling killed Highlander The Raven.  Buy it used, it's worth seeing... well, at least half the episodes.  My other advice is if you even like the show a little... don't watch the last episode.  It's a mess.  Seriously.  What enjoyment I had for the series by the end all went down the toilet watching it.  No spoliers, but you've been warned.",1236038400,5,2506,4.41703056768559

2260645,5,B00092A1J4,"This series was an off shoot from the original series that could have gone far further than it did.  It protrayed the reverse of the original Highlander series with the main character being a immortal Woman with a mortal Man as a secondary character.  There is action, humor, romance and even a bit of history there for the viewers.  A story of violence with a Woman's touch of grace.",1217808000,,384,4.536231884057971
2260646,4,B00092A1J4,"Too bad the series only lasted one season.

THE RAVEN picks up the story of Amanda, the popular recurring character from the Highlander series.  Amanda is an immortal and a thief who has been dividing her time most recently between Toronto and Paris (when not dropping into Duncan Macleod's life), engaging in various high thefts to support her highend lifestyle.  As the series opens Amanda crosses paths with Nick Wolfe, a police detective whose life becomes entangled with hers when he discovers her immortality.  Fans of the Highlander franchise will recognize much of the familiar formula, visiting immortals, flashbacks of previous lives, sword fights and Quickenings, that made the Highlander an international hit for 6 seasons.  Sadly THE RAVEN did not last past the first season.

Fans of the Highlander series had not been ready to see it end, neither had the series creators so the idea of a spinoff series was born.  Various concepts were tried out and eventually, with much fan enthusiasm, the character of Amanda, the character played by Elizabeth Gracen, who though originally planned for one episode, had become a recurring part of the series.  This spinoff, like the original Highlander series, was to be a syndicated program and an international effort.  Unfortunately the agreements seemed to stop there, along with apparently all communication.

The various groups creating this series (Canadian, French and German) all seemed to have different points of view about the direction of the new show.  Canadians wanted another rather dark action adventure much like the first Highlanders series, the Europeans wanted a more light romantic comedy show with even more differences between the French and Germans.  Sadly these issues were only a taste of things to come.

In addition to the 22 episodes this set includes four episodes with audio and visual commentaries and multi part feature concerning the problems that plagued the series.  There is an eighth disk, a cd-rom that contains biographies of most of the actors, a triva game, scripts of most of the shows and production notes and storyboards of a couple of the shows.  Fans of the show (and really who else would buy this set?) will probably enjoy these extras also as much as the episodes, if nothing else than to explain why a show that started with such promise ended so badly.",1204502400,4,2356,5.051679586563307
2260647,3,B00092A1J4,"I loved Highlander and one of my favorite characters was Amanda, played by Elizabeth Gracen. This show had potential but it was canceled before it could develop it. Elizabeth Gracen is always excellent. The rest of the cast? Not that great. The writing was a bit choppy and Johansson, who played Nick, had horrible chemistry with Amanda. His performance left much to be desired and the show turned into a detective show with a few immortals running around. It had none of the great mysticism the original Highlander had and lacked good stories. This is a pity though, I loved Amanda's character.",1202688000,,595,4.8431372549019605
2260648,1,B00092A1J4,"I recently purchased and viewed the entire Highlander series. I vaguely remembered this show and always thought Elizabeth Ward Gracen was a babe, so I purchased this. Boy, was I disappointed. It was even worse than I eventually remembered.

At the core, the setup is cheesy, there is little chemistry between the stars*, Paul Johansson isn't a very good actor and the immortal mythology is treated as a side-gimmick rather than central to the show (the episodes of Highlander that did this tended to be the worse ones as well.)

*Gracen and Johansson apparently hated each other, which partly explains the lack of chemistry, though bad writing didn't help.

It's also quite obvious that the producers lost some of their best writers and production staff. Using Montreal surely didn't help.

Fortunately, someone on eBay wanted it.",1188345600,8,830,5.080882352941177

2260650,2,B00092A1J4,"The premise is good, the actors well Paul I thought was quite good the other supporting folks also quite good. What shocked and disapointed me was that unlike it's predecessor the lead couldn't carry off her end of the deal.

I had thought an Amanda show would be fabulous, I loved Amanda in the original seires and in fact prefered her and much of the supporting cast over Adrian Paul for the most part. But what Adrian had that Elizabeth didn't was the strengh and skill to carry an entire episode/series.

It shocked me very much I was soo looking forward to this show and as each episode aired and I got more and more disapointed I finally just gave up caring.

I liked Paul I thought what they did with his character was so damn stupid and cheap, taken straight from Highlander and unoriginal.

Yes, the series is inconsistent, with many starts in many directions, but to me that adds to the fun and variety. The stories are interesting and fun, and the humour gives the show a whole new dimension. I am disappointed that the whole interview bonus seems to focus on the negative. Only one of the producers came out and said that good things were done and the series did merit a second season. I agree that the final episode left us with hope for many new adventures for our now immortal ""couple"" as they proceed into the future together. This series was really much better than a lot of people wanted it to be, and it deserves a lot more attention than it got. Kudos to Elizabeth and Paul!",1154044800,20,854,4.445859872611465
2260654,4,B00092A1J4,"The Raven series is very enjoyable.  It's a lot different from highlander since it has a lighter mood to it.  It would have been nice to see Methos show up in an episode.  I was surprised that they didn't show more female immortals coming after Amanda.  Bottom line is that regardless of what the behind the scenes interviewers opinionate, this was a excellent show and it was getting better every episode.",1139961600,7,406,4.676056338028169
2260655,5,B00092A1J4,"I slogged through ALL of the Adrian Paul Highlander DVDs so I could be up to speed when I rented (and then bought)THIS DVD set. I caught the original broadcasts but missed some weeks, and was hooked immediately. The writing was smart and sexy, the actors fun to watch. Girls with swords is a genre I appreciate in general, but I loved Raven and was sorry it didn't get past the first season.

But here's another thing. One of the recurring guests is popular German actor Hannes Jaenicke. Elizabeth Gracen and Paul Johannssen are good of course, but it's Hannes that pretty much steals the show. I kinda think the writers liked him, too. His character Bert Myers seemed to have some of the best character development and story arcs of the season.

Hannes is an animated, physical actor who's been cast in a ton of US made B movies, and so completely under-utilized in the US market. Perhaps the only recent ""big"" US movie he's done is a small role as Agent Hartman in Steven Seagal's Half Past Dead. But he shines even in those small roles.  He's considered an A-list actor in Germany. It would be great if someone actually ""discovered"" him here and brought him a little more notice.",1137110400,2,1182,4.566037735849057
2260656,4,B00092A1J4,"Amanda, one of the supporting characters from the Highlander: The season, was spun into a spin off series, Highlander : The Raven. Amanda has always been a thief and loves to steal (Think a female It Takes a Thief who can live forever). The problem with most spin off series is they are not as good as the originals, as this project is.

Amanda's  foil is Ex-con/security expert Nick Wolfe (The Wolf and the Raven) Nick and Amanda are as a couple act like a weaker Maddy and Dave (from Moonlighting, which one of the producer said they were trying to somewhat achieve with the Raven.)

The feature of the anatomy of this series told in hinesight from the cast and the crew is interesting and sometimes TOO MUCH INFORMATION. if you like back stories, these features on all the diskes will enlighten if this is up your alley. It has audio commentary as well.

The premise works. The shows of the complete Raven series are here. If you are a fan of the Highlander Canon (the movies, the series, the Raven), its worth its weigh in gold to you.

If you are a fan of the one season Raven, as I am-this DVD box set  is a little pricey for its contents, but the film quality is there!

2260657,3,B00092A1J4,"I bought this set recently.  The first thing on the Disc One menu isn't the first episode.  It's a behind the scenes series of interviews, which are titled, ""Highlander: The Raven  The Unraveling of a Show"".

When I watched the show during its orginial broadcast run in 1998, I thought it was a funny, action-oriented series with three or four well developed characters.  When the show was cancelled at the end of its first season, I figured some network suit had decided that another ""Friends"" like sitcom or one more knockoff of the home-video shows that depict stupid human tricks would get higher ratings and/or cost less to make.

I didn't know how much Hollywood BS had gone on.  How Elizabeth Gracen and Paul Johansson despised each other.  How the creative team had had no idea where to take the show after the initial episodes.  How the money dried up in mid-season.

I have watched the first five DVDs, and there has to be about an hour of the interviews I mentioned.  I suppose a better title for these vignettes would be ""Elizabeth Gracen and her enablers"".  She went well out of her way to give Johansson a hard way to go, even demanding of the show's brass that one script's ending be changed.  This ending did not directly involve Amanda's character, but did involve Nick's.

Personally, I find the conversations on these discs surprising.  What is depicted is pretty much How Not to Make a Succesful Show.  ""The Raven"" suffered as a result, and something that could have been very good was cut short after 22 only episodes.

Incidentally, the episodes themselves are pretty good.  Well written, and for the most part well acted.  Lucy and Bert Myers are excellent supporting chracters in what is pretty much a cop show.",1125187200,19,1735,4.704318936877076
2260658,3,B00092A1J4,"Reality fans will love this one - except fans of the Highlander franchise tend to prefer fantasy over reality, so the final verdict is a tad mixed.  Included on each of the eight discs is a ten minute segment of a featurette entitled ""Highlander Confidential:  The Unraveling of a Series"".  Unlike most commentary, where behind-the-scenes conflicts are downplayed or quietly ignored, these interviews are basically a sounding board for the creative forces behind this series to boldly complain about ""what went wrong"".  Blame is abundant and, shotgun-like, hits everyone.  The producers blame the actors, the directors and writers blame the producers, the actors, with well-performed hubris, blame themselves...and others.  So much vitriol is spewed that it could leave a bitter taste for those who enjoyed the series.  Among the reasons given for the series failure are Elizabeth Gracen's hair color, her ""crazy"" boyfriend at the time and the hugely unfortunate timing of the Clinton investigations.  Only David Abramowitz (head writer, listed here as ""Creative Consultant""), in my mind, seems to come close to the truth of the matter.  He correctly states that ""spin-offs rarely succeed"".  He is correct.  I would go further and say that the original series with Adrian Paul had begun to decline in the fifth season and hit the skids in the sixth, so launching a spin-off was probably unwise to begin with.  Given that this show was in syndication, the Panzer-Davis production team had to know that the declining ratings would result in poor timeslots (in my market, one had to search the post-midnight hours to find airings for it).  Lastly, Buffy & Xena aside, going with a female lead in a franchise known for their beefy male ""immortals"" was a critical mistake that cost them a good chunk of the female audience (can anyone say ""Lost opportunity with Peter Wingfield?"")  When all was said and done, the actual show wasn't bad.  Much like the original series, there were some clunky inconsistencies, but overall they did what the fans enjoyed:  Very beautiful people who live a long time making love, spouting philosophy and hacking off heads with pretty swords.  An extra shout-out for the historical flashbacks, always done with great eye and skill, despite the teensy budget.  For Panzer-Davis - take a Midol.  For the very gorgeous Paul Johannson, congrats on ""One Tree Hill"" (oh, for a better vehicle).  And to Elizabeth Gracen - take a cue from your character, Amanda, and get a backbone when it comes to men.",1123632000,66,2520,5.041062801932367

Then she has these little tea time moments. The sense of humor that she has most the time makes it hard to believe she can even get into a serious mode.
