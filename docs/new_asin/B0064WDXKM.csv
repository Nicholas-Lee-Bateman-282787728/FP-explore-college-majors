8493001,5,B0064WDXKM,Great Film! and a very important piece of current Japanese independent film,1518998400,,75,5.333333333333333
8493002,5,B0064WDXKM,"The film looks at the phenomen ""Hikikomori"", where in Japan shame prevents you from telling anyone about your children or any close one dropping out of society, locking themselves in their rooms for months or even years.

The film is a beautiful crafted with selective shots of neo-realist style so raw that you indulged into world of director Thrush's world of cinema where you lose track of whether this was a film of documentary.

This film has not only been selected in the International Film Festival arena but also at educational institutes around the world where doctors and students in this field experience ""Hikikomori"".

A must see!",1351814400,,642,4.981308411214953
8493003,5,B0064WDXKM,"The issue of education in Japan is taken, as we all know, very seriously. The red-hot pressure to succeed on university entry exams in order to go to an elite school have created a fall-out culture of shut-in kids, children who exist in self-exile in their bedrooms for decades, never leaving, while there families drop meals at their doorsteps and conduct a relationship on either side of a shut door. What price success! We witness the resultant approaching storm that is happening inside the head of the lead character. The atomic implosion of his psyche is the core of this drama. How it affects his younger brother is particularly touching.  Yes, there is a contemplativeness to all of those artful shots but they made me think a Japanese person had directed it instead of the Englishman Laurence Thrush.
When I see a movie, especially a foreign film, I want to be transported to another reality for 2 hours. That's what I felt with ""Left Handed"" like I was out of the U.S. and loving it. My fascination for Japanese culture was something I brought to the film, yes, but the quiet strength, largely I think because Thrush so successfully uses non-actors, kept me seduced throughout. I enjoyed the way I had to make my own conclusions as I watched the hyper-natural scenes play out and I'm a sucker for well-done black and white films.
This film is a compelling anti-coming of age film and I love being fascinated by the fact that an Englishman bothered to make it. There's not a false moment to be found.",1351555200,,1509,4.672932330827067
8493004,2,B0064WDXKM,"Storyline: A japanese documentary on the effect of the stress of family emphasis on education including the infamous cram schools. A middle or early high school male student is not doing well in his cram school and although loved by his mom but with an emotionally distant dad is becoming increasingly withdrawn and eventually locks himself in his room - refusing to come out or talk to anyone. His younger brother and mom leave food at his bedroom door. After 18 months of this mom sends for the administrator of a school that institutionalizes such cases and he eventually talks him out of the room for placement at the school where, perhaps, he will become less withdrawn.

Criticism: The story drags and is not particularly informative about the prevalence, causes, condition and treatments. Mostly it seemed as if the director/writer was in love with how clever they were in positioning the camera for certain shots and angles - excessively, on and on. It just loses the emotion and heart of the story and you're just left with glorified love of camera technique. Even the black and white motif and heavy use of symbolic or ambiguous scenes made the story seem more artsy than engaging. If you like watching a film of a small japanese apartment and food being prepared then this movie is for you. You also have to wonder why it's being released into DVD almost four years after being filmed.",1330473600,,1396,4.768595041322314
