4922499,5,B0060QEM5W,"Really unexpected.  Johnny and Joan together again. Set looked like it was made from pieces of Joan's old living room.
Still, there is a simplicity that we'll never see again!",1390003200,2,175,4.833333333333333
4922500,5,B0060QEM5W,"In 1968 after Joan Rivers was told by Johnny Carson on ""The Tonight Show"" that she was going to be a star Joan began her own talk show that aired in syndication. ""That Show with Joan Rivers"" aired on most NBC stations beginning in the fall of 1968 at 9:30 am weekdays and was a certified hit. The thirty minute chatfest always dealt with a certain topic that Joan and her guest of that particular episode would discuss. The topics delt with everything from men's fashions to plastic surgery and Joan showed the audience how funny and intelligent she really was.

 Although the program lasted one season due to Joan being overworked from doing both the series and her standup performances at night ""That Show"" is really a wonderful time capsule of the late sixties and the fact that the shows themselves exist is really a miracle as most NBC daytime shows were completely destroyed after their first airing.

 In this first volume six episodes are included along with the pilot that featured Johnny Carson. Other guests include Soupy Sales and Jerry Lewis, Joan's least favorite guest as he was rude and arrogant and half way through the interview he looked at his watch and told Joan he had to leave.

 There are two other volumes of ""That Show"" available individually and the entire first three volumes are housed in a special collector's edition with all 18 episodes. Unfortunately, there are no bonus features.",1328054400,5,1413,4.770491803278689
4922501,5,B0060QEM5W,"This DVD, along with volume 2, is a true treasure for any Joan Rivers fan and I'm thrilled that Amazon has them!! How great it is to see Joan in 1968 when her incredible career was just getting started. As all legends, her comedy is still funny today and ""That Show"" itself is very interesting - with single-topic shows and a content expert and a celebrity on the panel. Joan is charming, funny, smart and endearing in each episode and it really is a gift to be able to see her as she was so long ago. I love Joan but it's sad to see what she has done to her face and these DVDs allow us to see her before all of the cosmetic interventions, when she was actually able to show expressions. I absolutely recommend these DVDs to all of Joan's fans or anyone who's interested in a great time-capsule from the late '60s. As always, I'm grateful to Amazon for having such a great product!",1324080000,2,882,4.255952380952381

4922529,5,B0060QEM5W,"It's an old show, with a young Joan developing her comedic style, cadence, developing her quick comebacks. Some are good. Other jokes didn't go over too well, but in her youth, would try to push them.  Yes, a young Joan Rivers, but for me delightful. Delighted with this volume 1. After her death, I couldn't watch Joan Rivers. Too sad, but now, I turn to her to laugh and get a look at life through her eyes. If you're a FAN, watch.",1430438400,,433,4.280487804878049

8490650,5,B0060QEM5W,"That Show with Joan Rivers is 100% pure unfiltered 'Organic' Joan! The set is 60's nostalgic Heaven. No teleprompters, just Joan working the stage in front of an milquetoast audience. That's what makes this so addictive to watch. Joan was busting her chops every weekday morning as if she were in a room of the comedic greats. All Class. The dialogue and repartee with her guests was brilliant and fortunately overshadowed some of the more bland generic guests, some of who were up and comers in the world of showbiz. Delightfully Joan!",1514678400,,536,4.836956521739131

8490654,4,B0060QEM5W,"I love Joan Rivers, and I like the nostalgic feeling I get when I see all these folks that loom large from my youthful memories. Most interesting is to see the 'serious' guests talk about what were new and controversial issues for the time - natural child birth, raising kids without corporal punishment, nudism (what ever happened to nudist colonies I wonder?).
Also fun is the fact that this was produced with what seems like a small New York studio that's one step above public access. Her husband is the producer, and you can tell that network brass had no faith in a woman talk show host, much less one on that decade's 'bleeding edge' of comedy.
Overall, a good mix of serious topics with laughs as that 'spoonful of sugar' to let America wash the issues of the day down with.",1467504000,,782,4.514084507042254

8490656,4,B0060QEM5W,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Might be giving this more stars than typical but I was absolutely shocked at how funny Ms. Rivers is at the early stage of her career. When her first guest, the King of Comedy Johnny Carson, is completely overshadowed with her quick wit, solid stage presence, and natural stature, I was very impressed. I enjoyed seeing her diplomatic maneuvers with tricky guest and audience interactions as well as keeping up a fast pace to maintain interest.

Jerry Lewis comes off very preachy and confrontational with a noted medical authority, but Joan keeps her cool demeanor and placates the high maintenance guests with aplomb. I found the format of guest expert and celebrity to be challenging but she carried it off easily. I was disappointed this show was cancelled after one season.

High recommend for quality TV programming, Ms. Rivers early performances, and top notch entertainment overall. RIP",1459900800,2,936,5.064935064935065
