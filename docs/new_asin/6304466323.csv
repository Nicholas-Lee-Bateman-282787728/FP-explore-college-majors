7871742,5,6304466323,"Let's cut to the chase: You've got to see how a prostitute seduces a double-dipped, card-carrying, dyed-in-the-wool transvestite, transforming him into a ""natural man."" The scene was not a romp at all, but surprisingly thought-provoking. Nuff said. (Plz Note: No spoiler alert needed because. . . you'll see!)",1368576000,,309,5.458333333333333
7871743,5,6304466323,"If you want to see Roberto Cobo in a terrific performance after his debut film in Luis Bunuel's LOS OLVIDADOS, this is the film to see!  On the seamier side of life, Cobo plays a transvestite who fathered a daughter by a local prostitute,  The melodramatic film shows the repression of sexual ambiguity
in a small town and the prejudice that penetrates the local population.  I won't reveal the intense climax.",1367107200,,410,4.746478873239437
7871744,4,6304466323,"Any fan of arthouse Mexican films or the deeper of the gay-themed genre must own this just for Robert Cobo's great portrait of La Manuela, a down-and-out transvestite in rural Mexico putting up with machismo and hypocripsy in Latin culture.  It's a brutal film, at turns touching, always incisive. Man, films have gotten increasingly stupid and shallow since this gem appeared.  One can also learn about the life and conditions of rural Mexico -- they're tough, in case you haven't been there. Now try being a drag queen with a daughter and a bunch of horny, frustrated machos making your life worse. As a reviewer herein notes, the film is fair: it makes known that it's the social forces that repress and steer people into violence.  The treatment of all characters is fair.

See this oddball, brave flick.",1122681600,4,808,4.833333333333333
7871745,4,6304466323,"Arturo Ripstein Rosen is a Jewish Mexican director of some repute abroad. His closest American comparison would probably be Woody Allen. He is a favorite of the arthouse crowd at Cannes and elsewhere. Ripstein has made a career out of directing small films which are consumed locally and exported primarily to Europe. El Lugar Sin Limites (1978) is widely considered to be his most classic work.

 I admit I put off watching this film for some time, and only watched it as ""homework"". I am more of an epic/biography fan. Given that, I was pleasantly surprised by El Lugar Sin Limites. It's certainly an ""art"" movie, but it moves along quite well enough thru its 110 minute run time. It also has a lot of familiar faces to anyone who has watched much Mexican TV or films, bridging actors from la epoca dorada with current televisa regulars. In the lead, Roberto Cobo gives an excellent performance. You'll remember him as the boy lover from Bunuel's Los Olvidados (1950). He also appeared in Cabeza de Vaca as Loyoza (1991). Carmen Salinas, the Jerry Springer of Mexican TV, gives a good performance as a pudgy prostitute. Remarkably, she looks almost the same age in 1978 as she does now (born in 1933). The actors who portray La Japonesita, Pancho, & Octavio are all regular novela players now. And Fernando Soler as Don Alejo was one of four brothers who were in many Mexican epoca dorada films. Probably the best part of El Lugar Sin Limites is its poignancy: it's a biting critique of the hypocrisy of rural Mexican machismo culture. In that sense it's a nice companion piece to its contemporaneous Mexican classic Canoa (1975). The film's closing scenes pay a kind of homage to the epoca dorada style not unlike the retro noir tribute of Polanski's Chinatown a few years prior. But its frank dealing with homosexuality is decades ahead of its time; consider that Hollywood didn't really deal with homosexual topics in force until Philadelphia (1993) or Boys Don't Cry (1999), and neither of those films offered a full powered man-on-man kiss like this!

 My recommendation: for fans of Mexican or gay cinema, this is certainly a must own; for others, if you have an interest in expanding your horizons you could do a lot worse than this film. Regarding the DVD: the image quality is OK but it would have been nice if it had optional subtitles and in Spanish as well. No extras but still a great pick up at this reasonable price.",1091145600,11,2433,4.7176470588235295
7871746,5,6304466323,"This was the first movie by Ripstein I ever saw and although it's obviously low-budget and looks dank and dull, I loved the way the story and acting work together to examine the destructive effects of paternalistic  power in a small community. The main actors - 'Manuela' and 'Pancho' - work  miracles. The actor who played Manuela particularly is incredible at  portraying a lack-lustre, down-at-heel transvestite/brothel madam in such a  way as you identify with her and see her particular beauty clearly. I don't  know why he didn't work in more movies, but... that's life! The inevitable  violence of the end leaves you gutted and, more incredibly, understanding  what the forces were that led each person to act as they do; you see the  true tragedy as not down to individual blame, but social forces working  through people, locking them into insane courses of action. Watch this, if  you can get it...",942192000,11,908,4.9144736842105265
