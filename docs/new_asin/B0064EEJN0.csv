4949295,5,B0064EEJN0,The video is very helpful if you are thinking of using E2 and/or Forks over Knives to transition your diet. Rip goes thru two families' kitchens and helps them restock then shows them a couple of recipes each. Very helpful. I think it will be good for people who are a little overwhelmed by the book and need a nudge.,1325030400,6,317,4.3
4949296,5,B0064EEJN0,"Do you think you already have a ""healthy kitchen""?  Well maybe so.  BUT ...  you don't already have RIP!  So now you can have both.  RIP joins up with you in this informative and entertaining video.

In his Texas firefighter way, Rip makes a healthy kitchen FUN for two California families.  And now he makes it FUN for your family too.

First, there is a pantry makeover (with tips and explanations), and then a grocery store tour (what a rainbow of colors).  Then he demonstrates six of his most popular recipes, (kids - your favorites are here - and adults you can get out the grill).  He gives tips on HOW and WHY these techniques are healthier than the Standard American version.

What a great way to start the New Year -- with these family favorites in tow -- pizza, sandwiches, burger with fries, salad, ice cream, etc.  ALL done in a healthier and family friendly way.  ""Many hands in the kitchen, make light work."" This is such a good REMINDER of how we all can do better.

RIP motivates whole families to join in and participate in The Engine 2 Healthy Kitchen Rescue.  BEST OF ALL, this video is a gateway to a new family adventure.

If these six family favorite recipes are the only change you and your family make for 2012, it will be worth it.

Highly recommended.  And happily it's available on streaming, for only $3.99.",1325030400,4,1336,4.495833333333334
4949297,3,B0064EEJN0,"In this DVD, Texas firefighter and nutrition guru Rip Esselstyn visits two families and shows them how to cook a breakfast, lunch and dinner using recipes from the ""Engine 2 Diet"".  They also go shopping and he shows the families what to look for in grocery store products.  While an acceptable made-for-TV ""hour"" program of just over 50 minutes, it could have been so much more.  This low budget production is so much less substantial than the 20 year ""China Study"", the"" Forks Over Knives"" documentary, or even Rip's father's book ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease"".  The DVD was clearly shot over a few of days and edited together quickly to get the DVD out while the ""Engine 2 Diet"" and ""Forks Over Knives"" remain hot items.

The instruction given to the families is minimal and the long term outcome is never addressed.  Rip shows the families how to prepare only three daily meals.  Four children stand by as Rip discards their ""Reeses Peanut Butter Cup Cereal"" but then this program never shows how they fared months later.  How much of what he advocates did they really find success with and what remained a challenge?  Did the children really go from Froot Loops to fresh fruit for breakfast so easily?  Can they transition from the ""meat lovers pizza"" to a ""broccoli and nutritional yeast pizza"" without complaint?  This kind of superficial ""reality"" seems hard to swallow.  One of the more convincing elements in the ""Forks Over Knives"" documentary is how quickly the effects of this diet can be observed in the blood tests of the subjects.  Even this kind of follow up is not seen in ""The Engine 2 Kitchen Rescue"".  It simply feels like the producers wanted to spend days not months or years on this project.

Another interesting aspect to revisiting these families would be Rip's reaction to the changes they did not make.  For example, he threw out the commercial hummus that one family had in their fridge because of the fat and sodium content.  If the busy housewife managed to stop buying milk and meat, but returned to store bought hummus, would Rip be sympathetic?  He seems intolerant of variations to the ""Engine 2 Diet"" even when those modifications are so superior to the average American diet.

As an amateur chef and 20+ year vegetarian, I am critical of Rip's approach in the kitchen.  He seems to advocate throwing as many vegetables as possible at every dish with minimal regard to taste.  Take his ""signature"" lasagna with tofu, frozen broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, corn, peppers, onions, tomatoes and sweet potatoes.  In my mind, this could easily be 4 meals: traditional Italian (eggplant, zucchini, garlic, onion with lasagna noodles),  a tex mex lasagna (roasted peppers, corn, beans, onions layered with corn tortillas), an asian noodle dish (tofu, broccoli, carrots, cashews, asian greens with rice pasta) and then a harvest lasagna (sweet potato, mushroom, caramelized onions, whole grain lasagna and pecans).  Not only would this provide 4 meal variations, I would expect any one of them would taste better than the hodgepodge of flavors that Rip seems to endorse in many of his dishes.

The DVD does offer some benefits.  Learning to read food boxes carefully and the basics of low fat vegan cooking (with 6 meals) are shown.  It is certainly worth the price of the digital rental here on amazon.

I am a fan of the Engine 2 Diet and want all the success for this ""plant strong"" movement in America.  I believe heart disease, diabetes, obesity and many other illnesses are preventable.  As a teacher, I see the effects of students who eat poorly vs. those who eat well in the children's attention, attitude and test scores.  I just wanted a DVD like this one to do a better job spreading the message.",1324944000,223,3739,4.822605965463108
4949298,5,B0064EEJN0,"I read the Engine 2 book cover to cover, along with other books such as books by McDougall, Caldwell, and Dr. Esselstyn (Rip's father).  I've also seen Rip speak in person in Portland, Oregon.  When the video became available, I ordered it immediately.

I found the video enjoyable and informative.  I'm not sure that there was anything new for me, given how much reading I've done about vegan/plant-based eating, but it was great to see it in action.  Two families who were ready to make changes and take charge of their health get a personal lesson in their own homes, and it was fun to watch.  The only thing I'd hoped for was a follow up, to see if they were able to make the transition and stick with it, and how they benefited.  Even so, it's a very good video and I do recommend it.",1324684800,19,789,4.363013698630137
4949299,5,B0064EEJN0,"So I've watched Food Inc, Food Matters, King of Corn, Fat Sick and Nearly Dead, Forks Over Knives and any other documentary I can get my hands on.  I love all of them but I've had a hard time getting into the plant based diet because I've been intimidated by the recipes.  A lot of the ingredients are new to me such as nutritional yeast flakes, tofu, tamari, tempeh, seitan and several vegetables I haven't explored yet.  I immediately bought The Engine 2 Kitchen Rescue when it came available on Forksoverknives.com and watched it last night.  It gave me the kick start I needed to live the plant strong lifestyle.  This morning I cleaned out my fridge as well as my pantry and plan to head to Whole Foods this afternoon to stock my house with the Kitchen Must Haves provided on the engine2diet.com website.  A new year is approaching and I plan on taking advantage of the 28 day challenge to get the year started right.  The DVD isn't very long but I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to see how easy it is to eat a plant based diet.  Rip if you ever want to come to Chicago and teach me how to cook more recipes for a second DVD please let me know!!  We have a two story Whole Foods that you would love!",1324598400,77,1221,4.296943231441048
4949300,5,B0064EEJN0,"This journey for me started almost 4 months ago when I quit smoking. Like many other fans, I watched the documentary Forks Over Knives which than led me to Rip. What I love about Rip's approach is that it is stripped down by a healthy, hard working man that speaks like the rest of us. I ordered the Engine 2 diet book which was full of information but when I saw this dvd available for pre-order I jumped on it!

it is a great concept of walking 2 families thru cleaning out their pantry, shopping, reading & understanding labels and finally cooking great meals! Dr. Caldwell & Rip Esselstyn have reached Mac product status for me. Anything they sell.... I will buy! Thank you again for the gift of knowledge and health!",1324512000,24,721,4.462121212121212

If you've already read Rip's book, this DVD will offer you a solid refresher in cooking and shopping for eating plant-strong. I found a few great recipes and demos really helpful as well.

If you're new to the diet, this is a fantastic quick start on what to clear out of your kitchen, what to buy in the grocery store, and how to cook for true health and wellness. I'm giving this as a gift to family members who are just getting started and I think it will really help them.",1324425600,56,676,4.2734375

If you've seen Engine 2 (original) and other whole food, plant based presentations, in fact, if you've done any research at all, this DVD won't improve your knowledge. It's a somewhat high-level, low-info hands on guide to transforming your home and shopping habits to plant based with a couple of recipes thrown in.

4949312,3,B0064EEJN0,"This was good info for someone very new to the vegan lifestyle, but it offers really nothing for those already into the Forks Over Knives lifestyle. This makes it a costly blunder for those on a tight budget, if I hadn't subscribed to the Food Matters channel on ROKU and I had bought this, I would be so upset.  Rip's cookbooks are fantastic.  Worth every penny.  However I have to add support to the reviewer who was grossed out by the no use of utensils. Mixing a salad with his hands buried to the wrists and the people eating it after. There was even one time Rip coughed into his hand and then handled the cereal ingredients and everyone tasted them, no cooking and it made me squeamish.  I realize he is a fireman and that is probably how they do it at the station, but I would not have eaten it had I seen that.",1460332800,,819,4.230769230769231

I began my interest in plant-based foods after watching FSND 1/2, but I wanted to learn more about whole food/plant-based (WFPB) eating, so I watched Forks Over Knives, and other documentaries, read the China Study, and Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, and then I looked for whatever I could find by one of the Esselstyn family members. I bought all of their books, and I really love this one. Rip Esselstyn breaks WFPB eating down so that it is easy to understand, makes perfect sense, and does not seem so overwhelming a change to make. It is written VERY, VERY well, and has so many great bits of information, tips, and recipes!!!!  I actually bought it twice, paperback, and on my Kindle - so I have access to it all the time.

You need fats, and the type you get from coconut oil and olive oil are beneficial, when used in moderation.  I plan to incorporate more of those recipes into my diet, but won't follow that to the letter, as Rip kind of reminds me of a religious cult leader, and wants you to give up everything, and follow his way.",1437091200,,489,4.293478260869565

From the kitchen cupboard and fridge makeover to the shopping strategies and oil-free cooking techniques, this intro to a plant-strong lifestyle really helped motivate me to put more of these principles into effect in my daily eating habits, and I can vouch for the benefits as I have definitely been feeling stronger yet leaner, and healthier and more clear-headed overall as my body adjusts to this healthier way of nourishment.

Highly recommended for anyone who is interesting in getting a quick start onto a healthier way of eating from a guy who obviously thrives on what he is teaching, and whose father helped so many people to reverse their cardiovascular diseases through these principles.

I've watched this several times and gotten a bit more out of it each time.

Looking forward to a sequel or longer video series to go more comprehensively into this lifestyle.

Only one thing that I want to mention, I did some research into the ingredients on Grape-nuts cereal (which is recommended in one of the cereal recipes) and found that it contains isolated soy protein from GMO sources.  I recommend when purchasing cereals, be sure to get an organic or non-gmo certified cereal for our own safety as well as the health of the soils and farmers who work them on our behalf.

4949370,5,B0064EEJN0,"This is an excellent introduction to the low-fat plant-based whole foods lifestyle promoted by Rip Esselstyn, as well has his father, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn.

Rip visits two families that have decided to give the lifestyle a try. He starts in their pantries, clearing out items that are not allowed on the diet, and gives explanations why. Then he takes each couple shopping at Whole Foods and shows them what to buy. Then they return to each home and he prepares meals.

Having been on this dient for nearly two years (as of this writing), I remember that initial overwhelmed feeling I had of what to eat, what not to eat, what to clear out of my kitchen, what to buy, etc. This video clealy shows the ""deer in the headlights"" look on the faces of these two families. But in the end they are eating delicious meals prepared by Rip.

I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice to see how these families are faring six months or a year later, but for a hastily prepared video, this program explains a alot.

I was alarmed to see Rip using his hands to spread out many of the ingredients, not spoons or spatulas. Some people might be disgusted with the excessive amount of fingers in the food. But Rip is a healthy, likeable guy, and this is easily forgiven.

I hope that someday there is a sequel to see how these families did. This was worth watching two years after getting started to see how far we've come.",1368403200,,1417,4.455598455598456

Turned out my son had read it, liked it and sent it to my Kindle.

In reading it in the 8 hour bus trip between those 2 historic cities, I discovered that the authors were convinced that animal products were bad for your health.

Hey, I thought, why not try this.  Both my wife and I are octgenarians in reasonable health and frankly glad for any elixer which could extend our healthy lives. We both have living wills that mandate providers to pull the plug at the right time and we are ardent supports of Compassionate Choices, so we are looking for a satisfactory exit.

Anyway, our health since adopting a modified vegaterian diet has clearly done well. No more fat steaks, lamb chops and, yes, ice cream and cheese.

We feel better and with our daily regime of exercise and moderate food consumption, our bodily functions are moving smoothly.

I also really was intrigued by the show, Forks over Knieves. This show, however, seemed to not recognize some of the other issues with food in the typical American diet (for instance, gluten, GMO's, organics versus non-organics) with the clear focus being on a plant and grain based diet, and more specifically, a plant and grain based diet purchased from Whole Foods.  No before-and-after follow up to see how these families were doing on the diet, and if it was even manageable, particularly in a household with four children.  Yes, getting rid of the Fruit Loops probably made a huge difference in that family, but ridding the pantry of all of the cooking oils seems an unusual approach and one more based on body mass index than on the science of food.  Overall, I felt there were interested ideas and some of the recipes looked like they may be good to try, but it would be interesting to see how these families struggled to change their diets, and what results they were able to achieve by making meaningful change (a la the original Forks Over Knives story board).",1364169600,,1237,4.766355140186916

Some of the steps (making veggie patties, preparing the pizza dough) were skipped over, but complete instructions are available in the book.  Also, there are recipes offered in the extra features section, including some that were not in the movie. I found it interesting that the mom who proudly said she'd been a vegetarian for 19 years discovered that most of what she had been consuming was not, in fact, healthy. I know a number of people who make the same mistake; they think that as long as they are excluding meat from their diet they are healthier, when in actuality they are not consuming the wide variety of beans, fruit, vegetables, greens and grains that are not only available but necessary to follow a healthy vegetarian diet.",1363737600,3,1050,4.8277777777777775
4949392,5,B0064EEJN0,"Though this short documentary (it's about 50 minutes long) is not particularly comprehensive, it does serve as a great means of introducing people to the benefits of healthy, plant-based eating.

The reason I rate this program five stars is because it serves as a great way for people to get interested in how to lead healthier, happier lives, with enhanced energy and less complications. Though Rip has to point out things that seem ridiculously obvious, like, ""You need to read the ingredients"", and ""Saturated fat is not good for you"", the reality is that most Americans really don't know this basic stuff!

Don't get me wrong; I love the fact that more people are realizing that plant based diet is greatly benefical. In fact, I'm a raw foodist consuming at least 70% of my daily food intake with uncooked fruits and veggies to preserve enzymes and vitamins/minerals.

As far as the production, it's very amateurish and can be compared to your typical home videos. More importantly, the largest downfall is the lack of follow up interviews with the families.

4949402,3,B0064EEJN0,"I have been eating the Engine 2 plant based cereal for a while now and absolutely love it so when I saw the opportunity to watch this it seemed a no brainer. The problem I have with most of these diet gurus is they are very staunch zealots about their own methods and rarely display any kind of balance. Referring to milk as liquid flesh is a bit extreme (in this movie) and in fact milk has been a part of the caucasian diet for centuries even going back to Africa. Olive oil is another product that has been used for centuries in the mediterranean without people having heart attacks all over the place. People have also been using moderate amounts of meat off and on in their diets for all time without major heart/cholesterol problems or other disease issues. Should we tell the eskimoes and asians that fish in their diet is also a bad thing? I never understand why these people who have maybe been on this earth for 60 years feel the audacity to form new opinions on ancient methods, it doesn't make sense. Moderate amounts of milk, especially from exclusively grass fed cows is not a bad thing. The problem becomes when you drink milk all day and eat pounds of cooked cheese. It's just too much animal protein. He points out that most Americans eat on average about 7 different meals each month yet he doesn't point out it's because mothers neither have the time or energy to be totally creative! And people prefer to eat foods that they develop a comfort with over time. From my research I don't believe you have to completely reinvent your diet to get healthier. Stop trying to get people to eat weird substitutes like mushroom or black bean burgers or whole wheat pasta or sweet potato dishes or bulgar wheat or brewer's yeast - Yuck! Things like eating the Engine 2 cereal for breakfast, eating simple organic yogurt (soy if you like) with berries, bananas and pineapple, adding more soups to your diet and adding plenty of veggies, beans and mushrooms to it can help too. Cut up a few potatoes and grill them as a side dish to go with the soup to fill you up. You can buy plenty of organic chopped frozen vegetables that can be easily added to soups and you can find tofu noodles at most asian supermarkets. Remember most people only like a handful of vegetables that's why I suggest spinach, tomatoes and cabbage as good base vegetables - flavors that aren't too strong and textures that are natural to us. I often add onions and corn to things too. I also add chopped carrots where it makes sense. You can make a great sandwich by finding some really good whole grain bread, adding a small amount of your favorite protein source if you must and embellishing it with a whole bunch of either fresh organic spinach or shredded cabbage and tomatoes. On the other end of the spectrum, the major thing is cutting back on your animal protein which means more cutting back on meat rather than eliminating things. Using a 75/25 combination of tofu and chicken in dishes is a good start. Use enough chicken for flavor but mix in a good amount of tofu. And another major thing is to include more bean dishes into your diet, more chilis, burritos and other recipes. Rice dishes, especially using sprouted brown rice, are good too. I also have a favorite tomatillo salsa that I can eat with burritos or with healthy corn chips as a snack, fresh salsas can be great as a vegetable side dish. You could throw a spinach pasta with a soy based alfredo into your diet regimen once in a while too. If you have time you could find a good recipe for spinach pie too or maybe even potato kale tart or tofu quiche, add some mashed potatoes as a side and another vegetable and you're set. Don't forget to drink the occasional regular or black soy milk as part of your diet, pretty easy to do and pretty healthy too. I think so long as your diet is not consumed with heavy amounts of meats, cheese, heavily processed breads, pasta and sugars and you implement more things such as natural grains for breakfast, fruit, veggie soups and bean dishes more I think you'll find that your health will begin to change for the better.",1360108800,4,4113,4.492656875834446

I can't even find a reason why olive oil and such should be bad for my health - since I am far from obese - as it's stated in this 'movie' a couple of times.

While I was very, very impressed by the movie 'Forks over Knives', and have watched it several times, once was enough (too much) for the Engine 2 Diet. Rip Esselstyn empties the cupboards of two families, takes them shopping, and sets them up for a vegetarian diet. No animal protein. There is very little info on how to shop, and what to look for. When Rip is showing the families how to cook their new foods, you do not see any recipes, or any cooking demonstrations that are helpful to the viewer. Then, the movie ends. No follow up to see if the families stuck to their diets, or if their health improved.... nothing.

I've been vegetarian for almost 1 year now and I'm always eager to learn new things and recipes and that's what this video did. I love how it showed people that being vegan or vegetarian doesn't necessarily mean healthy. And that it's not difficult adopting a plant based diet. He show's how to make traditional american foods like burgers, sandwiches/panini, pizzas, lasagna, and also gives food substitute tips which is great when you really don't want to give up your favorite foods. There are milk alternatives, nut butter alternatives and so much more. There are good and bad foods. We just have to know how to identify them and have the resistance to stay away.

He shows 2 families who have made the decision to do a plant based diet - each of them cooks 3 recipes.  They also go shopping and he points out a few tidbits about how to read labels ... nothing about how the family progressed.  He literally spends one day with each family and that's that.

4949432,5,B0064EEJN0,"Prior to going on a plant based diet, I had late stage Atrial Fibrillation along with blood pressure of 146/114, was constantly exhausted and short of breath, etc.  I decided to change my lifestyle and went on this diet about 8 months ago.  Within about 2 months, I lost 14% of my body weight and my blood pressure dropped to 110/67. I haven't had an A-Fib ""incident"" for over 6 months, and that is after I was experiencing ""incidents"" that lasted anywhere from 10 to 14 hours several times a week.  Along with the diet, my wife and I (she's also on this diet) purchased a Needak Rebounder that we use every day for about 20 minutes.  I'm going to be 60 in a few weeks but haven't felt this good since I was 40.

Back to the diet ... we no longer even want to eat meat, dairy, processed foods, etc.  The Standard American Diet (SAD) is full of chemicals and additives.  Look around you.  You can't help notice the number of overweight/obese people there are ... due almost entirely to the SAD.  We both plan on being on the plant based diet for the rest of our lives.  It works !

Update as of 11/15/2013

My wife and I are still on a ""plant based"" diet.  My A-Fib problem has all but disappeared (I've had two minor incidents in the last 24 months, but none for 10 months).  I am going to be 62 in a few months and have more energy than I've had in years ... blood pressure remains in a consistent range of 108/67 ... without any medication.

Rip, a triathlete and fire fighter with an engaging and enthusiastic personality, visits two families who, after seeing the movie Forks Over Knives, have each committed to making the change to a plant-based diet but don't know where to begin.  One family has four children and also wants to introduce them to healthier eating habits.  Rip goes through the refrigerators and cupboards of each family in a relaxed, positive, and non-judgmental way, clearing out packaged and processed foods, dairy products, sodas, oils, and meats all the while explaining why these foods are nutritionally bankrupt.  He also does an excellent job of instructing us how to read labels, telling the family never to believe what is on the front of a label without delving into the nutrition facts and ingredients on the back.  We learn why labels such as ""Vegan"" or ""Fat Free"" don't necessarily mean ""Nutritious and Healthy"".

After the kitchen clean-outs, Rip takes each family shopping at Whole Foods, going through the same process in reverse--filling each cart with a wide variety of fresh and frozen vegetables and fruits, whole grains and whole grain products (after looking carefully at the labels for hidden sugars and oils)and low sodium beans. He also introduces them to some new products, such as nutritional yeast.  Each stop in the grocery store provides opportunity for low key lessons on what to look for when shopping to maximize nutrition, such as the fact that fiber and free radical busting phytonutrients are only found in plant foods.

Once back at each family's newly ""rescued"" kitchen, Rip involves each family, including the children, in preparing breakfast, lunch, and dinner with their new ingredients, teaching them how to prepare foods and cook without oil.  The genius of this section is that Rip prepares simple healthy versions of American standbys, making a healthful whole grain cereal topped with lots of chopped fruit, a sandwich--pannini actually, bursting with vegetables, a whole grain no-cheese delicious pizza topped with a large variety of vegetables, and finally Rip's Engine 2 Diet signature ""Raise the Roof Sweet Potato Lasagna"".

What makes this DVD so valuable, even to those of us who have been working on making the shift to a whole-foods, plant-based diet, is this SHOWS us what to do and where to begin.  One can read about how to make the transition, but for most of us it's still hard to translate this into practical steps when faced with a refrigerator and pantry full of typical American foods.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forks-Over-Knives-Presents-The-Engine-2-Kitchen-Rescue-with-Rip-Esselstyn/dp/B006NU6YEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forks Over Knives Presents The Engine 2 Kitchen Rescue with Rip Esselstyn</a>&nbsp;helps us shift how we approach our eating by taking the fear out of breaking with the past, cleaning out our kitchens, shopping for new foods and plunging into preparing  vibrant, nutritious, delicious and filling everyday foods.",1325116800,9,4533,6.443163097199341

The cleaning out of the cupboards is so necessary so as to not be constantly teased by the former, unhealthy favorites. The title is ""....
