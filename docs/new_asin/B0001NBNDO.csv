8015034,5,B0001NBNDO,"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while.  It's clever and original.  The primary character, Juan comes from a line of Matadors dating back 1000 years and he takes on the challenge to fulfill his destiny. His family move to East L.A. after his father, a great Matador, has a mis-hap in the bullfighting ring. A prize family possession is stolen and Juan goes on a quest to get it back.

Joey Medina can do it all -- write, direct, act and produce. The cast works well and the ""dream sequences"" are hilarious. I'm not easily impressed but this film impressed me. You'll need to watch it more than once because you'll still be laughing when the next funny part starts and you won't want to miss any of it.",1110844800,2,718,4.343283582089552
8015035,5,B0001NBNDO,"A HILARIOUS movie with drag queens, little people, and a pink chihuahua - who could ask for more?!?  A young matador moves to East LA, where he doesn't fit in, and the wackiness ensues.",1090713600,5,185,4.4411764705882355
