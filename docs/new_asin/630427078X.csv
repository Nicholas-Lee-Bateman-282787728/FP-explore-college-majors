7866157,3,630427078X,"Bergman began writing scripts for Svensk Filmindustri in 1943, when he was 24.  In October 1944, his first full script, directed by the legendary Alf Sjoberg, was filmed as ""Torment.""  The film was one of six made that year in honor of SF's 25th anniversary, but it was the only one that attracted critical attention.  Nonetheless, the film is flawed.

As he tells us in his autobiographical Images, ""Torment"" started out as ""an obsessive, anger-filled story about the torments of school and youth.""  Like all of Bergman's work, the story was pretty confessional and dark.  The ending in Bergman's original script has all the students except the main character passing their final exams.  The failed student walks out of the school into the rain, with his tormenter, the schoolteacher nicknamed Caligula, standing at a window watching him.  Even at this early stage of his career, Bergman was leaving audiences with ambiguous endings, refusing to tie up his films in artificially neat packages.

But SF honchos felt this ending was too depressing, so they changed it to the happier ending that's in the film.  They also transformed the Caligula character into an insecure and haunted crypto-Nazi, something Bergman hadn't intended.  But this re-envisioning of Caligula, and Stig Jarrel's masterful performance, doesn't mar the film.  Nor does Sjoberg's fantastic expressionist camera work.

Still, the experience taught Bergman a valuable lesson:  artistic integrity in the film industry meant that the film maker wrote and directed his own stuff, and that he resisted becoming financially dependent on studios.  In the years to come, Bergman would write nearly two-thirds of the films he directed, and he only rarely got tied up with big-money producers.",1220227200,,1755,5.240143369175628
7866158,4,630427078X,First screenplay by Ingmar Bergman. Main character played by Alf Kjellin who directed a few Columbo episodes in the seventies. A student falls in love with a prostitute who is mentally tortured by a sadistic teacher. Bergman's obsessions are already present in this 1944 movie.,1191628800,,277,5.177777777777778
7866159,3,630427078X,"Having read about it before watching it, I expected it to be different, but it's a good film anyway. Considering the time period it was created and the fact that it's his first movie, Bergman did a very good job. A small dose of melodrama and a touch of sinister suspense don't spoil it.",1189728000,,287,4.333333333333333
7866160,3,630427078X,"The new eclipse series by the Criterion Collection is great for bringing cinephiles everywhere the opportunity to see films like this. The film is not perfect nor does it entirely submerge the viewer, but for a real fan of cinema, or more particularly Bergman, you can ask for nothing more. The film reveals Bergman's roots, it has his signature dark, brooding characters and themes, desolate landscapes, if not, at times, his own imagistic stamp.

The story, however, is maybe the engaging side of mediocrity. The film draws you into the downward spiral of the main characters (the central focus of the story) without making the world seem hopeless and desolate. But it doesn't reach the pre-poop-your-pants euphoria it seems to promise. It's almost there, but doesn't realy ever clinch it.

The spiral of these characters is hidden within the world of the film. The torment, is silent, removed, intricate. The film is not what I expected from the early Bergman collection, and is not perfect, but is well worth the rent, for it's politics of the body, insight into Bergman's work and a subtle story that shames American suspense's absurdity, it's over-the-top plot structures, and its star driven sales. It's real, dark, flawed yet engaging. Worth a viewing or two.",1180915200,3,1267,5.0285714285714285
7866161,3,630427078X,"This feature is notable as the first screenplay written by Ingmar Bergman. It's only a pity that the direction by Alf Sjoberg is so plodding. It's easy to read the hero as Ingmar, a sensitive student played by Alf Kjellin who writes and plays the violin (he's creative) and is misunderstood by his parents. We see him singled out by the sadistic Latin master affectionately known as ""Caligula"" (his real name is never given) who teaches by intimidation and carries a stick in class. When Alf befriends the girl in the cigar store, Mai Zetterling, we can predict that she is also Caligula's ""lover"". It's probably because Mai is so tortured that Alf is attracted to her. The screenplay brands her of ""questionable reputation"" and only Alf is able to see beyond this shaming judgment. And we know she has a good heart since she lives with a kitten. The kitten reveals character. Caligula holds it as he tells the story of a cat he drowned, it's claws having to be surgically removed from him, while Alf plays with it when Mai attempts a seduction. The story of the drowned cat is a gothic Bergman touch in a screenplay which provides some enjoyable comaraderie between  the schoolboys, a dream sequence, and a surprising depth for the latin master. Caligula is both terrifying (is it a coincidence that he is made to resemble a Nazi?) and pitiful, yet still unlikeable. I particularly liked how he comes back to Alf with a coded threat, after he is warned by another school master. There are 2 unnecessary and melodramatic exisential comments - ""Why did this have to happen to me?"" and ""How could you?"" which betray Bergman as a fledgling writer, but also a delay in Mai telling Alf of her victimisation by Caligula, and even when she does speak of it, her details are unexpectedly non-specific. The school itself is as big as a museum, and Sjoberg gives us images of the large population running up and down levels. And Alf's family reside in an affluent looking apartment. Bergman doesn't tell us much about them, but their conversatism is established for Alf to react against. Sjoberg must be congratulated for not making Caligula's torment of Mai like a horror movie - if anything the horror is implied rather than shown - and the class scenes of students pressured to recite latin come across as far more stressful. Sjoberg doesn't utilise the close-ups Bergman would later employ, which therefore distances us from the characters, and one can overlook the seemingly advanced age of the schoolboys if one considers how they grow em big in Sweden. Note Bergman's own voice as a radio announcer.",982540800,2,2596,4.768888888888889
