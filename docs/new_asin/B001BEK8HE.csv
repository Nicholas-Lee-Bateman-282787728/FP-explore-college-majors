3489900,3,B001BEK8HE,"The plot is predictable and corny, about a big monster fishing store opening across the road from the struggling mom and pop store.  Smug and cocky fishing champ and owner of the new store constantly rubs mom and pop owner's face in his failures.  The language and content is quite family friendly (which is why I bought it).  And, I don't need to tell you how it ends, because it's really, as I said earlier, predictable. But, in spite of all that, the acting's not all that good.

3489902,4,B001BEK8HE,"My wife thought I might like this movie as I am an avid fisherman, and I like the comedy routines of Bill Engvall. I had just recently watched a comedy movie with him called ""Delta Farce"", that was a fun way to spend an afternoon in front of the tube. This movie is about Bill, the owner of an old bait shop at a big bass lake, who has a balloon payment coming up on the shop's mortgage. He has a collection of friends that hang out daily, some of whom are freeloaders, and the shop is not doing well. Things are bad enough before a nationally famous fisherman named ""Hot Rod Johnson"" comes to town. Billy Ray Cyrus as Hot Rod as a character is mean, arrogant, a braggart and a bully. Bill decides to enter the big bass tournament to save his shop, while even his own son seems enamored with the fishing superstar. Good supporting cast. As a fisherman I enjoyed the bait shop, boats and fishing stuff. I think Delta Farce was better, but this movie was more family friendly. No big violence, cursing or sex, just an easy movie to watch.",1300838400,2,1036,4.290816326530612

3489905,3,B001BEK8HE,"I'm a fan of Bill Engvall, one of the nicest, most family-friendly of the 'blue-collar' comedians, and ""Bait Shop"" plays to his strengths, as the debt-ridden but easy-going owner of a run-down bait shop frequented by an array of likable oddballs. With the bank calling in his mortgage, he is about to lose everything, and resign himself to a menial job with his smarmy, successful father-in-law, 'The Mattress King' (Harve Presnell)...but the Bass Masters Professional Fishing Tournament is in town, with a $50,000 prize, and a rules loophole that allows him (an amateur and past champion) to compete...against the world's greatest angler, egotistical Hot Rod Johnson (Billy Ray Cyrus). Can Engvall, with his rusty boat, ancient equipment, and long-latent fishing instincts, defeat state-of-the-art, high-powered 21st century technology? Do you have any doubt?

This isn't 'classic' comedy in any sense, but it never falls into the rut of 'toilet humor' (a frequent problem of the films of Engvall's peers), and it does promote positive family values, which is a happy 'plus'. Engvall is a 'natural', on camera, possessing the same kind of screen 'likability' as Tim Allen, and he and Cyrus play off each other surprisingly well.

""Bait Shop"" isn't a 'must-have' kind of film, but makes a pretty good 'family movie night' entry!",1255305600,8,1328,5.230046948356808

3489962,5,B001BEK8HE,"This silly, comic absurd movie should have been called, ""Kiss My Bass.""

Nonetheless, ""Bait Shop"" accurately defines this ridiculously rib-splitting, knee-slapping, belly-busting funny film. That said, first let me state, I'm part of the bass fishing crowd. I've been bass fishing for more than 20 years, salt-water bass, striped bass, so I understand the passion, the drive, the insane feelings for the need to bass fish. And this movie like in life, the scenes inside the bait shop could get reel wacky, reel quickly inside the doors of the local bait shop. For example, there, I remember talking to a fellow fisherman, he said he had spent 45 years working for the government, and it was time for him to take fishing quite seriously again. He did. Yet, he acted as though he had spent 45 years, five days a week, fishing. He considered himself an expert even though he spent most of his life pushing a pencil instead of cranking a reel. Every one, who fished on the surf at the local fishing hole, nevertheless, believed him, not knowing he was a long-time pencil pusher. Among the crowd, he became an instant fishing hero, even though I had never seen him catch a fish during the decades I had fished the waters.

Fishing could get reel wacky outside of fishing itself. This movie accurately describes how absurd fishing could get.

Anyway, back to this wacky, silly, absurd funny movie. This movie starts out with Bill Dugan, who owns a small-town bait and tackle shop receives a letter. The letter states he owns $15K, and he needs to pay his debt in a week or else, he'll lose his Bait shop. Not knowing what to do, he asks his friends, those who hang out at the bait shop for help. He asks his wife, Laura, played by Mary Rachel Dudley for help. Yet Bill, played by Bill Engvall, is in a reel bad bind. Word spreads quickly around town that he's in financial hot water. As a result, Hot Rod Johnson, played by Billy Ray Cyrus, opens up a bait shop across the street from Bill's place. This combined with Hot Rod's reputation and accomplishment for being a bass tournament master, puts the pressure on Bill Dugan. He faces the danger of losing his business, his only source of livelihood.

Regardless, of the tense situation, this movie is funny. Director C.B. Harding seems to have an understanding of the fishing community. And, he knows what works and doesn't work on the camera. He also plays off effectively the rivalry between Bill and Hot Rod. As a result, he paces this movie smoothly. Bait Shop is easy to watch.

In fact, I think I saw this movie several years ago on cable TV. Watching it for the second time was quite easy. The movie is funny. It also uses common language or action, like sticking a crooked index finger in one's mouth, to show someone's naivety. Or at least the fish's dumbness for getting caught on a phony lure.

Back to the action, so in the end, to get his money to pay his bills, Bill enrolls in a $50K fishing tournament to settle his debt. What follows is wacky fun of course. To appreciate and understand this movie better, it would help to be a passionate, addicted fishing person. Some fish so much they are known as hard-core fishing nuts, yet for the once in a while weekend warrior, this movie might be less funny.

This movie, for me, however, it shows the fun one could get, simply by dropping a line.",1495584000,2,3353,4.559800664451827

3489994,4,B001BEK8HE,"First off this is a dumb movie that is very much a straight to DVD type of movie. That being said - it was a GREAT dumb movie that is very much a straight to DVD type of movie. As a fishing type of guy with a 20 year old bass boat we've rebuilt and patched together I can relate to fishing alongside those GaZillion Dollar boats on the lake. The writing was actually pretty good and Bill Engvall did a pretty good job.

The characters hanging at the bait shop were funny as well. Heck, even Billy Ray Cyrus did an amazing job being a stuck up pro on the tour. I think he had some of the best lines in the movie. When he found out his young admirer was Engvall's son he said something along the lines of ""This is your son? I thought he was some wayward street orphan."" Not an exact quote but you get the idea. He did however sport some of the ugliest clothes in cinematic history.

In fact, that's what I really didn't enjoy about the movie were the over the top fishing clothes Cyrus wore. I think a better idea would have been just to suit him up like any other pro and let his character's ego set him up as the villain. But... I have to admit his Elvis Style fishing Jumpsuit would turn heads out on the dock.

It's not an academy award winner but it is a good clean family fun movie; especially if you still have a real local bait shop. Take it for what it's worth, a straight to DVD movie for fishing folk.",1435276800,4,1410,4.0647482014388485

3490054,4,B001BEK8HE,"I was told by a 10 year old girl (the one who sold it to me at the flea market) this was a real good film. This film is to bass fishing what Rocky is to boxing...almost. Bill Dugan (Bill Engvall) owns a bait shop on a lake. He has a cast of regulars in the shop which reminded my of the scenes by the fence in ""King of the Hill"" which include one man (Rus Blackwell) into conspiracy theories. Bill has a wonderful wife (Mary Rachel Dudley), a son (Vincent Martella) who needs some adjusting, a father-in-law (Harve Presnell) who is wealthy, and unfortunately a balloon payment on his shop.

To make matters worse the flashy bass fisherman, Hot Rod Johnson (Billy Ray Cyrus) has opened a fish emporium store next to Bill's Bait Shop. Bill enters the local fishing tournament were the prize is $50,000 in order to save his shop. Bill uses his old fashion fishing methods, while Hot Rod uses the latest high tech fish finders.

The comedy was simple. The story ignores the fact of any zoning discussions, or how one must legally land a fish in a tournament. While the movie creates characters, most of them were caricatures.

A fairly good film for family night. Only very slight innuendos, such as when Bill and his wife wake up, he places his arm around her and she says, ""No."" Girls in bikinis.",1347235200,,1294,4.451476793248945

3490056,3,B001BEK8HE,"""Bait Shop"" is a predictable, often corny, family-approved blue collar comedy revolving around a bass fishing tournament. Conceived and written by the amiable Bill Engvall, the film opens with down-on-his-luck bait shop owner Bill Dugan (Engvall, in a role that's not much of a stretch for him) and his band of crazed friends hanging out at the shop dwelling on poor Bill's bad luck, lack of business prowess, and personal problems with his overbearing father-in-law, Jack (veteran character actor Harve Presnell, ""The Mattress King"") who wants him to close the shop and enjoys berating him for his personal failures. Add to this his disinterested teen son Scott (Vincent Martella,) who is entitled and lazy, and poor Bill has his hands full. When he gets the letter from the bank giving him a week to come up with a $15,000 balloon payment on the shop, the future looks bleak.

The one person with a seemingly fabulous future is Hot Rod Johnson (Billy Ray Cyrus, in a role he described as his personally most challenging...really; watch the extras,) the number one bass fisherman in the world. Hot Rod is all flash but is incredibly shallow, arrogant, and egotistical. He also wears sequined fishing jumpsuits; his motto: ""Fishing is war!"" It is clear that the plot is going to turn this into another in a long string of character-driven underdog versus big shot movies, the only questions are what will be Hot Rod's undoing and how long will it take? For those looking for foreshadowing, please examine the somewhat ludicrous subplot about Scott (a teen with zero prior interest in fishing) being lured (if you'll pardon the pun) by Hot Rod's personal magnetism. It seems somewhat (OK, totally) unbelievable that Scott would become one of Hot Rod's minions, but that's how it unfolds, much to the consternation of Bill and his longsuffering wife Laura (Mary Rachel Dudley.) Could it be that this seemingly ludicrous plotpoint will be Hot Rod's undoing? I won't tell.

Interspersed with bouts of physical comedy (Bill in a bass suit, Bill's boat sinking, Bill falling out of the boat, Bill wrestling with a fish, etc.) the film focuses on the entire cast (minus Hot Rod, of course) learning that family and friends are more important than winning or success in the eyes of outsiders. The plot comes down to weighing the fish at the end of the tournament, and you get no points for guessing who wins and who gets banned from bass fishing for life for cheating, an event summarized by the question ""Is there a death penalty in bass fishing?""

The film has a bit of added credibility due to the official participation of ESPN, who sent real fishing commentators Mark Zona and Keith Alan to do the moderating; it's an effort that pays off and does add to the film's visual experience. There is much to roll your eyes at here too, of course: all the characters are caricatures that are tailor made for an extended Engvall routine, and much of the dialogue is beyond corny (""I am not a freak! I'm a bass!"") but while the film definitely breaks no comedic ground I am giving it three stars for its palatability for families (there is no objectionable material or language in the film) and the fact that it does in its own way make a moral stand for fair play and against arrogance and cheating. The extras are brief and are forgettable, with ""Opening the Bait Shop"" the best of the bunch and the gag reel the worst of the lot. If you like Bill Engvall, Billy Ray Cyrus, or fishing and want to see a comedy that is not especially nuanced but that has a positive underlying message, ""Bait Shop"" is a film for you.",1345939200,2,3605,4.709984152139461
