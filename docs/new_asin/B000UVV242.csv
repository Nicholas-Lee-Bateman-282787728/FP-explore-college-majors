2925823,3,B000UVV242,"I love the 10 minute solutions series so I was very excited to do the dance one but the choreograhy was very difficult.  Because the work out is only 10 min, the instructor went through everything very quickly.  I had to keep rewinding trying to learn the steps.  Needless to say I have only used this once or twice and have not gone back to it.  I was very disappointed.",1196640000,13,371,4.257142857142857
2925824,4,B000UVV242,"Jennifer is so upbeat and a great dancer.  She is great at all the movements, but I didn't feel there was quite enough instruction to help pick up the choreography.  There is a fair bit of repetition, so in time you'll pick up the steps but it's a little frustrating when you are a co-ordinated person already yet can't do all the moves.
The second segment I found to be the toughest.  It's done to 60's style music with 60's style moves and they go way too fast.  If however you can get them, you will burn heaps of calories.  The abs section is all standing and it's got to be performed as well as you possibly can in order to feel the burn.  I didn't think it was as good for my abs as floor work.
Overall, I do like this dvd because you don't need heaps of time on your hands to fit in some sort of exercise, but you need a fair bit of practice to perfect this and I'd really only use this workout as extra to what I already do or on days when I've only got 10-20 minutes to spare.",1195862400,17,985,4.0
2925843,5,B000UVV242,"I had this video for some time before I dared crack it open, but once I did I discovered I really enjoyed working out with it.  I am afraid to look in the mirror while doing the moves, because I don't think I look nearly as cute as Jennifer, but she makes exercise feel like fun dance rather than work.  I have all but 1 of her videos and Im glad I opened this up and started working on it.  Her abs work out is fun, sexy and are NOT sit ups which I loathe so much.",1370563200,,465,3.7731958762886597
2925844,4,B000UVV242,I do it every other day in the morning to get me moving.  i  just do the upper Body tone up and the Buns & Thigh sculpt.,1363824000,,120,3.4074074074074074
2925845,4,B000UVV242,"This DVD is led by Jennifer Galardi, who was also the instructor of a prior 10 Minute Solution release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Fat-Blasting-Dance-Mix/dp/B000GEIRAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix</a>.  Since I really enjoyed Jennifer's style in that video--I found her to be motivating, and the workouts were both fun and easy-to-follow--when I had the opportunity to purchase this DVD used, I thought I would give it a try.

Like all of offerings in the 10 Minute Solution series, this DVD consists of five 10-minute segments.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers you the opportunity to customize your workout:  you can select ""Play All"" or you can choose up to five segments to play in any order.  Jennifer teaches all of the segments live, working out alone in a large, bright studio; for the dance workouts, she tends to build up to a longer routine by gradually adding on choreography.  Two of the toning workouts use a stretchy fitness band.  I have listed the individual segments below, providing an overview of each one.

*SEXY SLIM DOWN*
Rather than a traditional march, Jennifer begins this workout with a tap step.  She adds a wide jump out and hop in, adding in a head drop to the side.  Some of the moves are relatively simple--e.g., a diagonal push step forward to either side--while others are more complicated, including a jump step that moves into a hip drop.  Jennifer does try to give colloquial visualizations to help with the moves: ""imagine pulling your shirt off over your head.""  She also says ""don't worry about the choreography,"" and I definitely had to take that to heart in order to follow along with this workout.

*HIGH ENERGY FAT BURNER*
As the title suggests, this segment IS more high energy--as soon as the music starts, you can hear that it is more upbeat, and there is a bit more impact to the entire workout.  There is a somewhat 60s feel to this routine.  Jennifer begins with a hip rock side-to-side.  She then does a move that is sort of like a front pony, later adding on a knee drop and an actual side-to-side pony.  The final move in this series was a surfer ""riding the wave"" that I found a bit tricky.  Otherwise, I thought that the choreography was a little easier in this second workout despite the fact that the workout itself was more challenging.

*DANCER'S ABS*
This routine starts out VERY similar to the abs routine in Jennifer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Fat-Blasting-Dance-Mix/dp/B000GEIRAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix</a>--i.e., you will be doing ab isolations to the front/back and side-to-side as well as hip rolls, adding a side-to-side movement to this.  Jennifer also teaches a sort of hip dip move that she says is similar to a belly dance move; she adds some additional dance shakes and hip side-to-side moves to this.  I found this segment harder to follow along; I think your form would really have to be impeccable in order to get a decent abs workout here.

*UPPER BODY TONE UP*
To my surprise, this was probably my favorite segment!  Jennifer uses the band here to work the arms, and you get a nice little workout in a short period of time.  First, Jennifer begins without the band and just does some basic neck stretches, shoulder rolls, and hamstring curls.  Picking up the band, she begins with a back row, adding in a nice twist.  She then performs bicep curls, doing several variations, including to the side.  She counters these with triceps kickbacks.  Next comes delt raises, also to both the front and the side.  Jennifer finishes with lat pull-downs, a chest move (again adding a nice twist), and a few quick stretches for the upper body.

*BUNS AND THIGH SCULPT*
This toning routine also uses the band, but it didn't feel as effective to me.  Many of the movements were ballet-like leg extensions (i.e., to the front, sides, and rear), but because Jennifer does not do many repetitions, I didn't feel like I got much out of this.  Similarly, she ties the band around the thighs for some plie work, but this segment was very brief.

As you can see, I have mixed feelings about this video.  In comparison to Jennifer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Fat-Blasting-Dance-Mix/dp/B000GEIRAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix</a>, I found the choreography to be a bit harder to learn in this DVD, which was disappointing.  However, I also found that the cardio segments of this DVD were a little more intense and interesting, which I liked.  I also liked the upper body toning segment quite a bit, although I didn't get much out of the lower body segment (or the abs--not sure whether to call that one cardio or toning).  For now, I will be keeping this DVD, and I'm giving it a final rating of 3 1/2 stars.",1350086400,2,4993,5.1425030978934325
2925846,3,B000UVV242,"The thing that irritates me right off the bat with this video is that the first ""dance step"" you learn is a modified version of a jumping jack.  I bought a dance workout because I thought it would be fun and I wouldn't realize that I was even working out.  Jumping jack type of moves are difficult for me because the impact hurts my ankles and knees.  The instructor doesn't offer any kind of modification for this movement so I find myself making up my own dances instead of following her lead.  I think that the first two dances were just not my style but when I skip ahead to the third one, I can actually have some fun and get into it.  I just think it's a shame to pay for an entire exercise video only to find that you can do about 1/3 of the program.",1350000000,5,757,4.087837837837838
2925847,4,B000UVV242,"Four stars for an excellent workout! Really fun. Maybe it moves a bit fast but that's not their fault, just my middle-aged fault. But as far as I can tell, the Amazon instant video version lacks what the 10-Minute Solution DVDs have, which is the ability to customize your workout, stringing together 10 minute segments as you wish. This plays from beginning to end and there is no ""bookmark"" feature in Amazon instant video to even mark the beginning of segments. Need a note card by the computer to right down times for the start of each segment. Kind of a bummer and definitely takes away a bit of the convenience of the 10-Minute Solution series. STILL, it's a great workout.",1346976000,4,679,4.619834710743802
2925848,3,B000UVV242,"I really like Jennifer Gilardi and I love her other 10 Min Solution Dance DVD, ""Fat Blasting Dance Mix"", so I decided to give this one a try too.  I am giving it three stars because 3 of the 5 segments are ok and 2 don't feel like much benefit at all.  I totally recommend her as an instructor, jut get her other DVD to really benefit from her expertise.",1345334400,,354,4.042857142857143
2925849,5,B000UVV242,I've had this video for a few years now and I love it. Great dances and quick too! They are perfect for those days when you don't have alot of time to exercise but you still wanna work it..believe me.. you can sweat in ten minutes! Highly Suggest this one.,1342569600,,256,4.14
2925850,1,B000UVV242,"The name says ""with fitness band"" and there is no fitness band!  Why list the product twice, once adding ""with fitness band"" to the item name, and then not include it?  This teaches me I should buy from sellers, not Amazon, since you can contact sellers, but there is no way I know to talk to anyone from Amazon.  I asked for a replacement, but since I couldn't talk to a person, I have no way of knowing if I'll just get another incomplete one.  VERY annoying.

2925851,3,B000UVV242,"I love Jennifer Galardi and 10 Minute Solutions, but I have mixed feelings about this one. The first dance is a nice cardio workout, but don't expect to have it down pat right from the start. I stumbled through many of the moves, but I got better each time. The second one is very energetic and fun, but too bouncy with how much weight I have on me. It's one I look forward to doing once I've gotten in a little better shape, and then I'll *really* melt the pounds off.

The ab routine is fun, but a little too fast for me. I have trouble doing Jennifer's quick isolating of the hips and rib cage, probably because of my weight. Had to slow it down a bit to really focus on my core. The first toning segment for the upper body really worked my arms out, but I didn't feel any sort of burn with the lower body segment. I grew frustrated, like I was just swinging my legs around for no reason. I prefer her lower body routing from Fat Blasting Dance Mix.

A nice addition to my ever expanding dance workout collection, something different for me, but not sure how often I'll go back to it...",1305244800,,1089,4.205741626794258
2925852,4,B000UVV242,"This fun and simple work out is 'just the thing' for ME! Because it is a 'Ten Minute Solution' I figure that I can at least find 10 miinutes in a day to do ONE of the work outs...if I have a bit more time, I will do TWO! Guilt free and fun.",1297123200,,240,3.547169811320755
2925863,1,B000UVV242,"I own a previous DVD from this instructor which I loved, and ordered this specific one because of the fitness band.  It costs more, and says in the front very clearly ""toning band included inside""... but I was extremely disappointed that when I opened it ... there was nothing except the DVD.  I do not live in the USA and a friend brought it to me.. so now I cannot do half the DVD because I don't have a toning band.  Very disappointed.",1295222400,,438,4.253012048192771
2925864,3,B000UVV242,"I have to agree with other reviewers, the coreography is difficult in the cardio sections. It does get your heart pumping. However, the abs and legs are for beginners only -- I barely feel a burn. The arms get more of a work out. If you only have 10 minutes, fine, this might be good for you. I just do some of the moves with the band while NOT watching the video. If you are looking for a burn, try Jillian Michaels' ""No problem areas"". You can select a section if you are short on time, and it gives a great workout.",1273449600,,518,4.088235294117647
2925865,5,B000UVV242,"I loved this one.
The dance is great it is really sexy and fun all the segments are good the music is fun and appropriate. I feel slimmer when I do all the workouts together.
I usually do the arm segment and then the legs with the band and then go to the sexy slim down the fat blasting and then the belly dance.
In this whole workout you will work but it is not too heavy.
I like to dance in my cardio workouts so I think that to do this one you have to be at least a little dance oriented. I liked the belly dance part very much.",1266537600,,531,3.7927927927927927
2925866,3,B000UVV242,This DVD requires a fitness band which was supposed to be included in the DVD.  The fitness band was no where to be found.  I had a type of fitness band which I am using with the DVD.  This DVD does not have as much dancing and does not get the heart rate up like the other 10 Minute Solution DVD's.  It is definitely more for toning.,1264809600,,334,3.9402985074626864
2925867,3,B000UVV242,"I have had good luck with other 10 Minute Solution dvd's, so thought I would purchase this one.  I will agree with everyone else that the dance moves in the first and second segment are complicated.  I think the main problem is the instructor doesn't have enough time to go through the moves before doing them as a full routine.  I was very frustrated after the second segment, and almost quit (which is normal for me), but figured I would move on.  The third segment is for the abs, but honestly, I didn't really feel much going on.  The fourth and fifth segments are strictly toning with the bands.  The moves are standard moves and the bands work okay, but I prefer to use weights.  I can never seem to hold the band well enough to make the exercise feel like it's working.  The instructor is nice; however, what is up with her Shushing during the exercises?  I felt like she was telling me to be quiet.  All in all, it's a good video to add into my rotation to burn some calories, but I wouldn't do it all the time.",1262649600,,1019,4.287958115183246
2925868,3,B000UVV242,"I bought this DVD because I love dance-based workouts.  In a way it reminds me of the classes I took at the gym, god knows what I looked like doing the exercises, but I got a great workout and was distracted enough not to quit!

My two biggest complaints are 1. There is no warm up to speak of.  I would have loved if this video had kind of a stretch and warm up segment in addition to the other higher intensity workouts.  Every dance class I've taken has had some kind of warm up at the beginning just to get you in the mood and on the beat.

2. BREAK DOWN THE MOVES.  Yes, the dances are fun, but I spent more time fiddling with my remote than I did working out the first couple of times I tried to do this video.  Also, I don't know how she transitions so quickly from one move to another.

As long as you don't expect to be doing the workouts all the way through on your first go, her attitude and the fun pace of the video is worth the extra work it takes to be able to do it.  I will probably buy another Jennifer Galardi DVD if I get tired of this one.",1262563200,,1060,3.9158878504672896
2925869,1,B000UVV242,"This DVD is frustrating. The ""Sexy Slim Down"" segment claims to be ""easy-to-learn"", but I found myself rewinding multiple times, and still not getting the steps right.  I finally gave up.  :(
The ""Dancer's Abs"" segment was equally frustrating.  I haven't tried the ""High Engergy Fat Burner"" because I'm scared.
The tone and sculpt segments are ok.  The toning band is fairly straight forward.  But in contrast to the other 2 segments I tried, I didn't feel like these two segments were that intense of a workout.",1260230400,,512,4.839080459770115
2925870,4,B000UVV242,"""The Ten Minute Solution"" is a great format because it really divides the five workouts into totally different styles which is imperative for not getting bored.  I'm pretty good with dance choreography, but I could see a beginner having a really difficult time with this.  I definitely recommend that you have some experience before trying this DVD.

The ""Sexy Slim Down"" is a little too slinky for my tastes, but not so sexy that I refuse to do it.  It has a lot of fun moves, but I did feel that she didn't have to throw in a ""take your clothes off"" move.  A fun and jazzy, cardio workout.

""High Energy Fat Burner"" will really put you to the test as in it Jennifer throws really cardio movements at you pretty quickly.  It's very old-school with ponies and surf moves thrown in.  A lot of fun and the best workout on the DVD.

""Dancer's Abs"" starts off really slow with some slow ab movements, but it gradually builds into a routine.  It is NOT bellydancing.  It is just movements that focus on the abs, although Jen does have one move she calls the ""bellydance move.""  I use it as my warm-up as the first few minutes are really not cardio.

The ""Upper Body Tone Up"" uses moves that probably everyone except the true beginner are familiar with.  Bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, and more is what you can expect.  Doesn't really leave a burn, but I still think that it works my arms and chest.

""Buns & Thigh Sculpt"" really doesn't just focus on those two areas, but rather your whole lower body.  It is pretty basic, and it doesn't make me sore the next day, although I am sure that I am working my legs.

All in all, it is a fabulous workout with Jennifer Galardi that just has a couple of flaws like the fact that there are basically no warm-ups/cool-downs in the cardio segments.  I loved it, though, and it's up there in my favorite workouts!",1259798400,,1847,4.411242603550296

2925873,2,B000UVV242,I am a big fan of Jennifer Gilardi and I expected to really enjoy this DVD.  So far I've only used it twice.  The cardio routines are somewhat complex which is typical of Galardi's style but I didn't feel like either of them was a good cardio workout.  The ab section is just awkward and almost silly.  The upper and lower body toning sections are actually quite good.  The DVD comes with a band but the resistance is very light.  More advanced users will need a stronger band or to modify the moves to use dumbbells which is what I do. Overall this DVD is much more suited to the beginner.,1249171200,4,590,4.27027027027027
2925874,3,B000UVV242,"Having mastered Jennifer Galardi's previous 10 Minute Solution dance DVD, 'Fat Blasting Dance Mix', I was looking forward to giving this one a go. Although Jennifer is pleasant, friendly and not overly perky, I was a little disappointed to get just 2 dance cardio routines, as I'm not sure 'Dancer's Abs' would completely qualify as a dance workout (lots of small movement standing abs work), however there are some fun moves in there.

I've given this 3 stars for the 3 workouts out of the 5 which I think give the most benefit. '*Sexy Slimdown' is a fast paced, multi-step routine which you'll need more room for than you think, with some great dance moves similar to what you'd see on any music channel and '*High Energy Fat Burner' goes like the absolute clappers, really fast, with a sixties feel to it, some retro moves, but mostly you'll be bouncing around on your toes for 10 minutes, so very high cardio. I particularly liked the 'surfing' move, which will make you feel like a real dancer! 'Dancer's Abs' was my least favourite, as although there were a few motivating moves, the instructor favours a standing ab workout and lots of isolation repetitions, which I find tricky to do.

There are toning sections, one on arms and the other on *legs/buns for which you'll need a resistance band. I've been spoiled here, as for me, nothing beats working out with a band to '10 Minute Solutions Pilates: Slim and Sculpt', so the very functional arm workout didn't offer me enough of a challenge, but the leg/buns section was better, loved the frog stretch plus it does give medium level cardio and there are some inspired ballet moves to do with the band.

All the exercises are standing, so no need for a mat, but the dance routines can be a little tough on your carpet. I think I'll be using this one on a less regular basis than my other cardio workouts, but I'll keep it in my programme as overall, it's a fun workout.",1247616000,,1926,4.593023255813954

And, no where on the label did it say it was set to dance music.  Well, it doesn't. The music is like a fast paced elevator music.  No motivation!!!  I am cool with the moves, no complaint there, but when she says ""put some attitude in it"" it was impossible for me to feel funky listening to a boring, non-descriptive beat.

2925878,3,B000UVV242,"I am a fan of the 10 minute Solution workout DVD's and after using Fat Blasting Dance mix, with this same instructor I decided to give this one a try.  I have had this DVD for about 6 months now and learned the dance steps fairly quickly, but I just don't really enjoy them.  This is one I just don't pick up all that often.

* The First Routine- Sexy Slim Down is pretty fun, but I've seen better.

* The Second Routine- High Energy Fat Burner I just don't enjoy.  It  seems really goofy to me.

* The Dancer's Abs- is my favorite routine.  You really have to have a good sense of your abs and know how to work them in a standing position.  If done correctly this Routine can be effective.  However if you really want a good ab workout try ""10 minute Solution Quick Tummy Toners"" or ""Denise Austin Best Belly Fat Blasters""- these two DVD's are by far my favorites for when I need a good ab workout and I'm short on time.

* Upper Body Tone Up- You will get a fairly good upper body workout, but I don't think it's long enough, or has enough resistance for it to really be effective.

* Buns & Thighs Sculpt- My lower body is my trouble zone and I need more of a workout than this offers.  Too short and not enough resistance.

On a positive note The instructor, Jennifer Galardi, is very pleaseant, energetic, and a very good dancer.  She does go through the moves very quickly, but after a few times watching it you can pick up the steps.

I have to say, (and the reason this dvd gets 2 stars instead of 1) the 10 minute short workouts and the dvd setup (how you can program more than one, etc) is the ONLY thing going for this video!

I am a professional dancer, and am sad to say that woman can NOT dance! She looks so comical and stiff. The moves are really bad, and my husband could make them look better (and that's saying alot!). The music was bad too.
Also, what bothers me is the safety of it as well. There is NO warmup or stretch (you should do it on your own)but then again they are trying to get a workout in in only 10 minutes.

 I also belly dance professionally, and her ""belly dance"" move in the abs workout is horrendous. People might hurt themselves if they dance like she does. I guess I'm sick of so-called fitness professionals teaching dance forms/moves they know nothing about.

It makes working out so much fun, and so fast! I really recommend it to anyone! And if you find it hard to keep up, just do whatever you can and you'll pick up more and more each time.

I am going to buy more ""1o Minute Solutions"" after using this one.",1226102400,,384,3.682926829268293
2925884,2,B000UVV242,"I'm not a big fan of the 10 Minute Solution series and this DVD just confirms it for me. Jennifer Galardi is a pleasent instructor and the workout is not extremely bad, but nothing I want to do again. The first two sections are soso, but then it just gets worse. The belly dance section was pretty bad and the two toning sections a total waste of time. Just not effective at all.",1224460800,,379,4.205479452054795
2925885,3,B000UVV242,"I have used many DVDs in the 10-Minute Solution series and have written reviews of quite a few of them here on Amazon.  I have found 10-Minute Solution to be a consistently good series.  However, I did not enjoy this workout--on the whole--as much as I have most others in the series.

The focus of this workout is dancing--and working out out like a dancer.  The leader is Jennifer Galardi.  She is perky and energetic without being too over-the-top.  As with all workouts in the 10-Minute Solution series, you can design your own workout from the 5 10-minute segments, just do one if you're pressed for time, or do the whole 50 minutes in the order presented.  My thoughts on the workout follow:

General:  I think I would have probably liked this workout a lot more had I been in my 20s or 30s.  However, at age 55, the dancey segments didn't thrill me.  I felt this workout more in my knees than I did in the parts of the body where I was supposed to feel it.  There is a great deal of foot twisting in this workout and some jumping and hopping.  If you're working out on a non-carpeted surface like Jennifer, that may not be an issue for you.  However, for those of us on a carpeted surface AND with aging knees, these moves can be punishing on the knees.  To clarify, when I say there is jumping/hopping, I don't mean that this is necessarily super high impact, just that some of us prefer not to (or can't) jump so I like to forewarn people of that.

Sexy Slimdown:  This segment featured one of my least favorite things in a workout--layered choreography; i.e., where steps keep getting added on and on and on in a chain.  It gets a bit much to remember.  Still, it's a relatively fun segment, I guess, if you can keep it all straight.

High Energy Fat Burner:  The music seemed ridiculously (almost comically) fast at times, esp. if you are working out on carpet (unless you are young, thin and fit enough to jump up in the air--like Jennifer--and not have carpet drag).  Lots of foot twisting and jumping about in this one.  This was my least favorite segment of the workout.

Dancer's Abs:  Unlike most ab workouts, this one is done while standing (and dancing).  There are some belly dancing moves in here as well as some moves I've done in hula workouts.  Some of it I found too fast with not enough instruction or cueing to do the first time around but, overall, it's relatively enjoyable.

Upper Body Tone Up:  Here we finally stop dancing and get to stand still.  A resistance band is required.  This segment works out lats, biceps, triceps, shoulders, back and chest, with a little work on the obliques as well.  Nothing very new or earth-shattering, but I liked the segment.

Buns and Thighs Sculpt:  Like the upper body segment, a resistance band is required here as well.  This segment works quads, hams, inner and outer thighs and glutes.  This segment requires good balance to do it as shown (though Jennifer does say you can use a chair to hold on to if you find the balancing too daunting).  Again, nothing new here, but I liked the segment.",1217721600,5,3065,4.48731884057971
2925886,1,B000UVV242,"I went through the entire tape one time and then retired it to the bottom of the library where it will remain hidden.  The ""dance"" steps are not only badly choreographed, but pretty dang stupid.  Other ""10 minute Solution"" tapes I've tried are wonderful, don't waste your time or money on this one.",1209081600,5,298,4.60377358490566
2925887,5,B000UVV242,"This routine was so fun!  I've only done it once but could have done it all over again right away as I was eager to try to improve my steps.  Its kind of tough to follow but I'm sure this will help to keep it interesting for more than a few tries.  Great music, not a single grapevine!",1207008000,4,285,3.8793103448275863

2925889,5,B000UVV242,"Jennifer is by far my favorite instructor and this is another great dvd by her. Also I love the 10 minute solution dvd's which makes this one of my all-time favorite dvd's.

I love putting short workouts together to create my own routine for the day since I get easily bored, and nowadays I always use some of the segments from this dvd.

I must say the arm segment with the toning band has worked wonders with my arms. The best thing about the band is that you can always change the lenght of it to increase or decrease the workout. Everyone should try it. The standing ab segment is also great if your really move and follow Jennifer's lead.

Buy it if you like Jennifer and the other 10 minute solution dvd's.",1204934400,3,712,4.338345864661654

2925891,4,B000UVV242,"I will admit, the first time I put this video in, I stopped halfway through the first workout, skipped to another, and then completely quit.  The second time, I had a little more luck.  Lets just say, by the 3rd time, I was determined that I was going to get through this.

I originally thought that the dance moves were far too complicated, and the instructor far too bubbly (in fact, I kind of wanted to knock her out).

Once I finally got used to her and the moves, I realized that it's actually a pretty good cardio video, given that I abhor cardio.  I wouldn't say that it necessarily tones anything up (seriously, that stomach/hip/shoulders roll, who can do that??), but it does make you break a sweat and at least get your metabolism going.

I always do the entire DVD so that I feel like I've got my cardio in, and now that I've finally gotten accustomed to the aspects and dance steps, I really like the DVD.  Definitely couple it with some sort of target toners video or strength training that requires weights or a stability ball, or the like, and just have fun with this video instead.

If nothing else, it does teach some pretty good dance moves....I wouldn't bust any of them out in a club, but it's a good, fun DVD, so just have fun with it.",1201651200,16,1256,4.360515021459228
2925892,2,B000UVV242,"I love dancing and I don't get any satisfaction from this video. She does not motivate me to burn energy/calories and since she dancing alone (which is fine for some people) she does not have the intensity to make people want to exercise.  On the other hand, the video is entertaining and each workout is only 10 minutes which fits my schedule.",1197417600,6,344,4.548387096774194

8215173,1,B000UVV242,"This workout is waaayyyy too fast.  I do not consider myself a dancer by any stretch of the imagination and I was hoping to have a workout routine that would be fun and enjoyable.  I was lost in the first 5 seconds.  It seems as though the instructor is teaching choreography to an audience of fellow dancers instead of guiding a novice through basic steps and helping beginners with core moves and key concepts to develop strength, balance and grace.  I ended up just awkwardly bouncing around my living room for 30 minutes and in the end felt uncoordinated, ungainly,  and discouraged.",1407628800,,587,4.715686274509804

8215175,5,B000UVV242,"I read the other reviews and was very hesitant because they weren't so good.  I don't get intimidated by tricky dance moves because I am very coordinated.  If you are not, than this probably isn't the video for you.  I on the other hand love a challenge when it comes to dancing.  This video is fun and distracts me from watching the clock.  I love the arm band 10 minute segment, I definitely feel it.  I wanted to give a good review and let new buyers know if you're even just thinking about this video, you might as well go for it.  You don't have anything to lose, other than weight :)  I was pleasantly surprised and love love love Jennifer Galardi!",1377216000,,654,4.30327868852459
8215176,4,B000UVV242,"I ordered this video because I already own Jennifer Galardi's other 10 Minute Solution dance DVD and really like it. This one is just as good, but it did take some practice. I had to watch it a couple of times before I could get the moves down well, but I'm also a poor dancer, so most people may not have this problem.

The routines are fun and fast paced (especially the second one) and the toning band is a nice extra. The toning routines, however, are separate from the dance routines, so if you want cardio and strength training, then you have to do more than one routine. Thankfully, since they're only 10 minutes long, it's still a quick work-out.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with this DVD.",1374796800,,701,4.384615384615385
