8759874,3,B01EZXMVMM,"While this is the full set with both seasons it does not include the OVAs unfortunately.  Also the picture, quality, and subtitles are not up to the standard that would be expected.  I am not entirely certain that this isn't a bootleg edition, as there are many indicators that it might be (including scorch marks on the disc edges, poor and fast subtitles, and suffering audio).  So buyers beware.  This is the full set, but don't expect high quality audio, picture, and subs.",1487635200,3,477,4.710843373493976
