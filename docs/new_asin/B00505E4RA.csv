8450733,3,B00505E4RA,"These newsreels histories are okay but all suffer from the same flaws.  The introduction is useless (Nazi Germany 101) and time-consuming, and pointless; obviously anybody buying original newsreel footage from Nazi Germany already knows who Hitler was.  They would have been better served to tell us something about the propaganda companies and how the newsreels were actually produced and shown (this information is completely lacking).  The film transfers are not great, varying from poor to good.  The English translation is laughable, as is often the case the producers seem to feel they have to choose between somebody who speaks German and somebody who knows a little about WW2, but cannot have both.  I rate it as highly as I have because it is a full set for a very reasonable price.",1443312000,,791,5.00763358778626
8450734,4,B00505E4RA,"This review is of Volume 16: 1943, Part 4.  Highlights:

A very interesting armored train routes partisans;
German armor vs. Soviet:  Pzkw IV and a Ferdinand.  Unlike Hollywood film, you know you are seeing the real thing here.
Cavalry in action.  A regiment of horsemen.
Sgt. Goldberg receives the Knight's Cross for destroying 12 Soviet tanks in one day with his light howitzer.
FW 190As and Me109Gs shoot down B-17s.  Wrecked B17s and RAF bombers are scrapped out and the pieces loaded on rail cars.
Speer and Porsche at a meeting;
The Gigant, a 6-engine transport plane, the largest in the world.  We see light tanks, artillery, and trucks load into it and unload from it.
German and Rumanian Stukas strafe in the Kuban Peninsula in November 1943.
U-boat resupply from a supply U-boat.
Himmler inspects a new Moslem volunteer SS Division;
Red Cross women pack Christmas boxes for the Eastern Front;
Berlin children are evacuated after U.S. and British bombing;
Tiger I tanks in action on the Eastern Front, and, the new Panther tank enters the war.

Set the audio to German with English subtitles, then start from Main Menu, Eastern Front (skip the Introduction).",1370304000,,1167,4.918367346938775
