2116251,5,B0002RQ2S0,Well I love all the Xena episodes even when the storyline was getting a lil old and running out of plots. But I am a true fan of the show and stuck by it til the end.,1094947200,,166,3.5135135135135136
2116252,4,B0002RQ2S0,"After a great season opener and a somewhat continuation of the season opener, the episodes go from great to (B) status instead of the usual (A) because of the terrible new costume for Xena because of her baby on the show and in real life (this is just my opinion, sorry the original is best, but she was having a baby, what can you do) and the understanding that Lucy Lawless (Xena) can't do alot of her stunts so Renee O'Connor is the Xena for half of the season due to Lucy's baby. This isn't really a bad thing, it just sets up most of the first part of season 5 for comedy because thats better suited for a pregnant Lucy, and a side kick who even though can kick butt in her own right, can't hold a show on her own since thats usually Xena's job. Also the occasional corny episodes are sort of out of place and the worst episode of the series, ""Married With Fishsticks"", my god, that episode was bad. They also had that episode where lucy is wearing her new costume instead of her old one, in which she got back since she had her baby; there was a sort of an continuality problem with that, since you don't go back to the old costume and switch back to the new just for one episode. I believe they just had that episode out of order (sorry about the complaint, it just bugged me alot, and you will notice it). All side, the rest of the season was great, some of the best moments from the series are towards the end of Season 5 especially with ""Livia"", ""Eve"", and I do believe the one episode to be the most action packed and rightfully so of the entire series run ""Motherhood"", where Xena alone takes on the rest of the gods. So even though the season had its ups and downs, it had more ups than downs. I wouldn't let a few gripes and complaints to distract you from a great season full of great action and great characters. Remember this is coming from a TRUE fan of the series.",1093824000,17,1883,4.190082644628099
2116253,5,B0002RQ2S0,I would highly recommend this Xena DVD Set! The majority of these episodes are very good and the quality of the DVD's are amazing! Xena is well worth the money spent!,1093478400,2,166,4.387096774193548
2116254,4,B0002RQ2S0,"Season 5 is probably my second favorite Xena season, after Season 3. Xena and Gabrielle literally go to hell and back, and that's just in the season opener.  Xena has a mystery child and is hunted by the gods -- and then, after a miraculous 25-year sleep, has to face both her own grown daughter and the gods as adversaries.  In the meantime, Gabrielle grows into a warrior and Ares grows a heart.

There are a lot of fan complaints about this season.  Yes, it had its share of duds like ANIMAL ATTRACTION, PURITY/BACK IN THE BOTTLE, and LIFEBLOOD/KINDRED SPIRITS, and Xena's discovery of her pregnancy was handled rather badly (there really should have been more suspicion that the mystery baby could be evil). However, I thought the Twilight of the Gods arc was excellent, even if aspects of it could have been done better.  I loved the Livia/Eve story and the interaction between Xena and Ares.  The late, lamented Kevin Smith did a great job playing Ares with greater layers of complexity, as the God of War confronts both the specter of mortality and his feelings for Xena.  There was also a great new character, Athena, wonderfully played by Paris Jefferson. CHAKRAM, SEEDS OF FAITH, AMPHIPOLIS UNDER SIEGE, and LOOKING DEATH IN THE EYE/LIVIA/EVE/MOTHERHOOD are among my favorite Xena eps.

So, I love the season.  Now, the DVD set (which I have had a chance to view because I pre-ordered it directly from Davis-Anderson).

The sound/picture quality is great, no complaints there.  The extras, though, don't quite measure up to Season 3.  Some of the season's best episodes such as AMPHIPOLIS UNDER SIEGE and LOOKING DEATH IN THE EYE have no extras (interviews or commentary) at all.  As in Season 4 only four of the episodes have audio/video commentary, compared to seven in S3. I was particularly disappointed that there were no interviews with Steve Sears (he did leave early in the season but I would have liked to hear his insights on SUCCESSION), nothing with Paris Jefferson, and only one little tidbit from Ted Raimi -- I would have loved to see him talk about playing old Joxer.

On the plus side, the commentaries were a lot of fun.  No earth-shattering insights perhaps, but some very interesting observations about the show and the characters and some very enjoyable banter betwen Lucy Lawless, Renee O'Connor and Rob Tapert, and also between producers Eric Gruendemann and R.J. Stewart on FALLEN ANGEL.  Some of the interviews are great as well; I especially enjoyed the comments from Hudson Leick (Callisto), Adrienne Wilkinson (Livia/Eve), and writer/producer Chris Manheim.

Unfortunately there are no bloopers with this season set.  There was some interesting deleted footage from MOTHERHOOD, but I can't for the life of me understand why they'd choose to show deleted/alternate footage from ANIMAL ATTRACTION rather than a much better episode such as SEEDS OF FAITH (which apparently had a very interesting scene of Ares training Gabrielle) or CHAKRAM.  We do, however, get a 100th ep B-roll for SOF with good behind the scenes footage.",1091404800,69,3060,4.953033268101761
2116255,5,B0002RQ2S0,"Of the 6 glorious seasons, this was my least favorite. This, however, doesn't mean it was horrible- because it wasn't!! The show can absolutely do no wrong yet when compared to the four seasons before and the final and finest season that proceeded, Season 5 came up just a little short. As stunning as the heartmelting chemistry between Lucy Lawless & Renee O'Connor has always been, there was just something undeniably missing from their (usually mushy, protective and loving) acting and from the scripts themselves; I don't know if the crew was simply run ragged, fighting, or if Lucy's pregnancy was a difficult subject to write/act around...but the episodes sometimes lacked the poignance and magic that us fans had been so incredibly spoiled with. But still, there were some truly excellent EXCELLENT moments and landmarks such as: X & G struggles in the afterlife, the birth of Xena & Gabrielle's baby & the battle to save it from the clutches of the desperate Olympian gods, the growth of the baby and the story of her tangled destiny, a scary trip to the new underworld, Eli's hopeful sacrifice, wretched Callisto's dramatic transformation and gift, Gab as a mermaid, and a notable possession by the Furies horridly endangers everyone.
MY 5th season FAVES INCLUDE:
Fallen Angel
Xena's and Gabrielle's crucified bodies are retrieved by their friends, while the departed duo are caught in the middle of an afterlife battle between demons and angels. A truly inspiring tale, wicked special effects and packed with heartening surprises! A classic.
Chakram
Xena has no recollection of being a warrior after she and Gabrielle are resurrected from the dead, seemingly, by Eli.
Succession
Xena and Gabrielle must face Mavican, Ares' new right-hand woman, with some added complications.
Seeds of Faith
Eli takes on Ares in an effort to overthrow the gods and pregnant Xena finally learns the true identity of her baby's father. Profound and touching storyline...
God Fearing Child
X & G's baby is born after Hercules steps in to battle his father, Zeus, who learns that the birth of the child will signal the Twilight (end of the Olympian order) Hera, Queen of the gods, steps in to make a shocking decision
Motherhood
With the lives of Gabrielle and Eve hanging in the balance, Xena faces the gods in a final showdown.",1025395200,23,2318,4.97680412371134
2116256,5,B0002RQ2S0,"Ah, the Xena Season 5 Videos have finally hit the public.  After ordering all six seasons on customized, catalog videos,it is nice to see them available to the average people.
Okay, so let's get started.  Season five of Xena: Warrior Princess was an amazing ride.  From the dark opener ""Fallen Angel"" to the light hearted ""Kindred Spirits"" we saw many emotions of joy and sadness.  Xena's child was born and hunted down by the God's.  Kevin Sorbo, a.k.a. Hercules, made one last appearance as the Son of Zeus in ""God Fearing Child,"" where he tried to save Xena's child, Eve, from death.  The season ended with the dramatic ""Motherhood,"" one of my personal favourites.  Eve is hunted down by the gods, is reformed and entered into the religion of Eli, and Gabrielle is nearly murdered by Xena.
With a landmark 22 episodes filled with laugter, joy, and sadness, this is a video set that you do not want to miss.  Order it today from Amazon.com!...",1022630400,11,945,4.684848484848485

2116347,4,B0002RQ2S0,I watched season 4 and it was so dark I did not want to watch Season 5. But Season 5 was not dark at all. The only episode I had a problem with was the first episode on season 5. I did not agree with the heaven and hell scene. I thought they went too far with that scene and that was some of the ideas still left over from Season 4 that just got caught on season 5. I think someone came up with the ideas for season 4 and pushed it on the writers. They have to stay employed so they had to go with them but season 5 I could tell that they went back to the original ideas of what made Xena truly a great dvd to watch. Whatever and whoever came up with the ideas for season 4 went extremely too far. It's okay to have imagination and come up with characters and creatures people have never seen before but season 4 seemed too demonic. Like someone was trying to teach the audience the traditions and rituals rather than it being a season and telling a story of heroic deeds and tales. I hated 4 but season 5 really redeemed itself. I would give 5 stars but I hated the first episode and really thought it took away from the epic and heroic story of Xena.,1421366400,,1152,3.9913419913419914

2116368,5,B0002RQ2S0,"A lot of people complain about Xena and Gabrielle not being close enough this season. Like they are business partners instead of Best Pals/Soul-mates. Or so I've read.

Well you know there are a lot of people who are over analyzing this TV show.
If you are reading this you have certainly read some fanfic and episode guides like Whoosh and Xenaville. By the gods people get their knickers in a twist if Xena or Gabrielle does something they consider wrong. Or the director sucked or the writers were on LSD. Or it was too hot or raining.

Too much energy expended, often with stunning length, about what was wrong with season 5.

Yes, it is great to see Xena and Gabrielle all nice and cozy by the campfire. It would be better to see them married in fact.

Renaissance has played this relationship about 2 main characters that are both women closer to the edge than any other TV show. You can only go so far before you've gone too far. RenPics knew this.

This series has a number of good episodes. I don't need to see Xena and Gabrielle snuggling by the campfire all the time. TPTB have written enough of that plenty of times.

In fact, Gabrielle is one fierce a$$ kicker during this series. Finally got over that Peace and Love BS in S4.

So sit back and enjoy season 5. Because you can't change it and it is still a good show.

Season 6 wouldn't exist without season 5.",1411084800,5,1373,4.377952755905512

Renee O'Conner is her faithful companion and bears a strong resemblance to Allison Mack who played Chloe in Smallville is striking with her golden blond hair, these 2 make a great team. The battle scenes are done exceptionally well, these girls are very athlethic with their swords, flashy movements and body flips that would be the envy of professional wrestlers today. And Jennifer Sky, the beautiful charmer from Cleopatra 2525 makes several guest appearances as an Amazon warrior this season. And one of Xena's most formidable foes, Ares, is back again.

The main story arch this season surrounds the mystery of Xena's pregnancy, the protection of her unborn child from a variety of evil antagonists and warriors and the birth of her child Eve midway through this season. Beautifuily photographed in New Zealand, these stories are always exciting, filled with action, drama, humor and attractive guest stars, including Alexandra Tydings as the lovely Aphrodite and Kevin Sorbo as Hercules, this is a show that will be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds

And by the way, XENA is the name of my cat, from whom this character was named, so this review is dedicated to her and all the Xena's of the world.",1406160000,,1387,4.948497854077253
2116374,5,B0002RQ2S0,"This is a great series.  Season 5 fell a bit short midway in the season but it did get better.  This show has something for everyone - action, adventure, fantasy, sci-fi, comedy, drama - with great actors and clever writing.  Xena had a plethora of stars who guest-starred early in their careers.  The tone of each episode varied, so it was refreshing to have that unpredictability and change from week to week.  Shot in New Zealand, it offered plenty of beautiful scenery to enjoy.  Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor have a magical chemistry that is endearing.  One of the best things I love that you don't see with shows anymore is that the lighting on this show was fantastic.  It wasn't ever dark or hard to see.  It was a pleasure and easy to watch; bright, beautiful and always lit well even indoors.  I had never realized what a big difference that could make until watching Xena.  Just a heads-up, there are two versions of the dvd's: 1. the original deluxe dvd's include all of the bonus content  2. the re-released dvd's only have the episodes.  I have both sets and haven't noticed a difference in the picture or sound quality between the two, so it really just depends on if you want the bonus content or not.",1403222400,,1219,4.536697247706422
2116375,5,B0002RQ2S0,"Xena is one of the most enjoyable, inspiring, action-packed, fun-filled, romantic shows ever to grace the small screen. I admit, when I began watching Xena, I was very skeptical. Initially, I found the character Gabrielle more an irritant than anything else. But character evolution is where the talent of the writers really shines.  Gabrielle matures and becomes a warrior in her own right, a mirror image of the darker, more violence-prone Xena. By the show's finale (Friend In Need) Gabrielle has won over the hearts and minds of Xena fans the world over.

Very gradually, X:WP develops, depending on how one looks at it, it is unfolds as epic romance between two women, or the greatest friendship the world has ever seen. Regardless of how you see Xena and Gabrielle, this show is about the love shared between two people, a theme as old as time itself. It is also about accountability for one's past, making amends for one's wrong doings, turning away from violence, and the absolute stupidity/futility of war.

X:WP has it all, too. Drama, comedy, tragedy: deep, soul stirring tragedy that will bring tears to your eyes. Lucy Lawless is a talented singer who had formal training. Her voice adds greatly to the musical episodes. In addition, the man who composed the musical scores (Joseph LoDuca) is a genius. The musical score is available on amazon as well.

I only see a few drawbacks. The first goes to the heart of the show itself, and is echoed by so many X:WP fans. Be warned, once you watch this show, you'll discover there is no other like it. Search all you want, there are no other heroes comparable to Xena and Gabrielle.

The next will hopefully be corrected when the series is remastered. Some of the sets do not have closed captioning and that can be a real problem, especially when it comes to the extra material. Further, I understand that the sound quality of some of these sets is less than optimal. Many have commented that the sets produced by Universal are captioned and have better sound quality.

For the men and women who have loved Xena for all of these years, this is a worthwhile investment to keep Xena alive in your hearts. In addition, the sound track to the tv show continues to be available and is a very worthwhile addition for fans who loved LoDuca's pieces. Finally, many well written stories continue to be written by fans of Xena and Gabrielle. All you need do is google ""Xena fan fiction"" to access the work of the many talented bards who found their voice thanks to the show Xena Warrior Princess.",1403049600,,2543,4.690582959641255

The disc did show some small lines on it. I find this strange since it was bought brand new.

I have found the Universal releases have the best picture and audio quality compared to other releases.  Additionally, the Universal releases include subtitles, which some other releases do not have.  Since season 5 is not out yet (pre-order only), my rating is based on the media and packaging quality of the previous 4 releases, not the show content.

2116385,5,B0002RQ2S0,"This is my personal favorite Xena season, sure it had its dud episodes (like Married with Fishsticks which I consider the worst episode of the whole series) but had way more epic episodes to make it up for (like Motherhood, God Fearing Child and Amphipolis Under Siege) and also introduced gave the opportunity to see other gods that were just recurring characters in both Hercules and Xena series like Athena (I've always loved how Paris Jefferson performed that role), Arthemis, Hades and also more of Ares that just made one appearance during season 4. This is also the season that marks the last appearances of some regular characters of other seasons like Callisto and Eli. Also about the extras of the dvd, those feature some episodes with commentaries of Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor along with short interviews with the actors and directors and how they got the inspiration of some of the episodes.

2116403,2,B0002RQ2S0,"I loved the Xena series when it was televised ... and, when I saw that it was available through Amazon [Xena fans will recognize how appropriate that is!], I couldn't wait to get Season Five.  HOWEVER, the first episode on the first DVD in this DVD set has stalling problems, i.e., the program repeatedly stops briefly for no apparent reason before lurching ahead again.  I will TRY to watch the rest of the DVDs to see how many DVDs are bogus ... then report on this forum ... then return for refund or replacement.  Because things are starting out badly, I expect to report more bad news on this problem at that time.

Follow-up comments: I ran into another DVD with stalling problems in this DVD set.  I would like to return this DVD set for replacement or refund, but Amazon's FAQs say ""You may return most new, unopened items sold and fulfilled by Amazon.com within 30 days of delivery for a full refund.""  Unfortunately (and I bet I'm not the only one with this issue) watching a whole season's worth DVD set often will take longer than 30 days.  Therefore, I'm stuck with a partially useless DVD set.

This season is available through Netflx online streaming, BUT not ALL of the episodes are online (they picked a few of the good ones to make DVD-only) and none of the extra features are online either.

As for the season itself, it's awesome.  Gabrielle's character finally kicking more butt was a SERIOUS breath of fresh air.  Xena's character, as always, continues to be awesome even if almost all of her is covered by layers of leather.

The leads coming back from the dead, one of them 'magically' pregnant, and of course the 'Twilight of the Gods' storyline was received with mixed reactions. My review is for the people who enjoyed the season when it aired, and are considering purchasing the dvd box set. This product:

*Contains all the episodes aired for season five.
*Several episodes have audio/video commentary, while several more includes interviews from cast and crew.
*Some of the 'important episodes' do not have commentary or interview included with them. (Personally, I didn't mind that much)
*There are bonus features, nothing too extravagant.
*Overall, this product was excellent and worth the money I spent.",1242691200,,756,5.19672131147541
2116430,5,B0002RQ2S0,"Xena never ceases to amaze me. After four previous seasons you would think you've just about seen all the possible marvelous deeds of the beautiful and deadly Warrior Princess wouldn't you? Well not so, imagine Xena as an Archangel fighting beside the highly esteemed Michael, or maybe an Arch Demon battling the forces of good for ownership of heaven. It could never happen you say? You'd be wrong, in `Fallen Angel' the first episode of season five she does both after being crucified on a cross. What does that dying on a cross part remind you of? I shouldn't say it but I simply cannot resist, Xena died for our sins.

And that's just to wet the appetite in a season that sees the redemption of Callisto, the birth of Xena's baby girl, a twenty-five year hibernation period for the Warrior Princess and side-kick Gabrielle catapulting them into the future, the death of Joxer, hearing Ares say ""I love you"" and the demise of the Olympian God's.

How nice not having to wait though commercials. Or waiting till next week to find out what happens. Season 1-3 was great! Season 4 was pretty good. Season 5 was alright. I really did enjoy the stories to the season. But Xena pregnant was so hard to grasp. Where in the other seasons she had left her son with the centaurs, so she could still be Xena. I know Lucy Lawless was pregnant while filming this Season. Why couldn't the Directors work around it? I agree with what someone said earlier. Why was Eve any different then Hope? I know Xena knew where the baby had come from. But who to say Eve wasn't another Hope. But I did enjoy the Season. But I just couldn't understand why Xena had to be Pregnant.

2116433,5,B0002RQ2S0,"(One person said this was the worst season ever I disagree with episodes like Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire (Musical), Antony and Cleopatra, and brining a new character into the mix Eve (Xena's daughter) was fulfilling. Yes I admit some of the episodes I didn't love Married with Fishsticks was one of them, but none the less what did you expect? They did almost everything imaginable in season 1-4 yet they still brought fresh ideas like (Animal Attraction) where the characters take a spin on The Wild Wild West, (Chakram) exploring what Xena would be like without her eagerness to fight and do good, or Xena battling and killing most of the Greek Gods. Bottom line great season)

This series had everything in it: Comedy, drama, inspiration, musicals, etc... I also believe this was a series that helped create certain television shows and movies. Watch (Here She Comes... Miss Amphipolis 1997) and tell me that's not similar to (Miss. Congeniality 2000). Remember that Xena was being played in a different time period (Historical Times) and Miss. Congeniality is being played in the present, yet they are still similar. The show not only had a few good laughs with the help of Joxer (Ted Rami)but also allows viewer the feeling of Catharsis. Seeing Xena battle her past demons and realizing she wouldn't be the hero she is without her past is PRICELESS. Also watching the growth of  Xena (Lucy Lawless) and Gabrielle's (Renee O Conner) friendship is something very special. They become family and travel to the exotic lands of Asia and to the beautiful landscape of Egypt etc...

The DVDS are worth it I own all 6 seasons and the commentaries are GREAT. I especially love watching Hudson Leick's (Callisto)commentary she's intelligent, funny, and beautiful.

P.S. My one note would be buy the director's cut of The Final Episode (A Friend In Need) because it's much better. Plus you get great extras including commentary by Lucy, Renee, and Rob and you also get behind the scene footage including a little B-Day cake for Lucy. The commentary is great I just finished watching it again for my 100th time because I find Lucy and Renee hysterical.

I will always have faith that a Xena Movie will be made, although Gabrielle lost faith in her Hope; I will always have faith that Xena will eventually become a movie; plus I'm only 19 so I still have plenty of years left to wait lol.

Well Thank you Lucy, Renee, Rob, Hudson, Ted, Bruce, Kevin and all the other people that made Xena possible. You filled many homes with joy, laughter, and inspiration; it truly is one of televisions greatest moments!",1200787200,,2598,4.800894854586129

2116438,5,B0002RQ2S0,"Warning!  Spoilers ahead!

Season Four of XENA had been disappointing after a riveting Season Three, primarily because a long string of flat episodes in the middle of the season.  Season Five, despite real life complications caused by Lucy Lawless's pregnancy, was not only a great return to form, but a great improvement in its dramatic arcs.  Season Three was the series best season for comic episodes, but Seasons Five and Six took the dramatic arcs to the show's highest points.

This is the season where the payoff from the Season Four introduction of Eli bears fruit.  The Eli arc structures the series in its final two seasons as much as any other aspect of the show excepting Xena and Gabrielle's deep relationship.  His message of self-reliance framed in the context of relationships of love and without the need for the Olympian gods culminates in the death of Eli (at the hand of Ares in the show's 100th episode) and the growing influence of Eli's teachings.  Eli's bearing more than a little physical resemblance to traditional representations of Jesus is not accidental, with John the Baptist in Season Six shown as a follower of Eli.  And it is his teaching on how humans do not need the Gods combined with the Fates' prophesy that Xena's child will cause the downfall of the Olympians that generates one of the most compelling story arcs in the entire run of the series:  the attempted destruction of Eve by the Gods.

XENA was never a show unwilling to take risks, but perhaps the single greatest risk the show ever took was ""Looking Death in the Eye"" and the two episodes that followed it, ""Livia"" and ""Eve.""  In these, in an attempt to protect Eve from Athena, Hades, and the other Olympians, Xena and Gabrielle fake their own deaths.  But their plans goes awry when Ares, who is unaware that they are feigning their deaths, takes both of them to icy coffins on an isolated mountain peak, and then seals the tomb.  When a landslide awakens them from their long sleep, they discover that twenty-five years have passed.  Eve had been raised by Octavius, who is now known as Augustus Caesar while she is now known as Livia.  The Olympian gods, who have long thought that Eve was dead, have ceased looking for her.  The final episodes of the season deal with Xena and Gabrielle convincing Eve that Xena is her mother and that she, who as Livia has been a persecutor of the followers of Eli, was prophesied to be Eli's messenger.  The season ends with Xena having been granted the ability to kill gods through the purification of Eve.  These arcs will all arise again in Season Six as Xena dispatches the Olympians with the unexpected assistance of some of the gods.

Season Five was a good one despite the presence of two of the stinkiest episodes I've ever seen on TV.  ""Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire,"" the second and by far the weakest of the two XENA musical episodes (the first was actually quite good) is the only episode of XENA that I've never been able to finish.  But as bad as it was, ""Married with Fishsticks"" makes it look like a masterpiece.  If I were asked to name the worst episode of any series that I have ever seen, I without hesitation would choose ""Married with Fishsticks.""  In it, Gabrielle, who is unconscious after being hit in the head and nearly drowned, imagines she is the mermaid mother in a family consisting of Joxer and three half human/half sea creature children.  In the commentaries accompanying the discs the crew and creative staff insist that XENA fans either love or hate the episode, but I simply do not believe them.  Everyone I have ever talked to despises the episode.  When most watch the episode, they scratch their heads and wonder what drugs were involved in inspiring it.

XENA is one of the more unique series in the history of TV.  Its greatest claim to fame was providing TV with the first convincing female action hero in the history of TV, with the possible exception of Mrs. Emma Peel.  But it raises multiple challenges to anyone who attempts to enjoy it.  Whether you can enjoy or appreciate the show depends on suspending one's disbelief on several levels.  For instance, that Xena and Gabrielle could have encountered in their lifetime such famous (and noncontemporary) individuals as King David, Goliath, Julius Caesar, Virgil, Homer, Euripides, Odin, Grendel, Beowulf, Ulysses, Pandora, Brutus, Marc Antony, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, and Augustus, not to mention Hercules and the full range of Olympian gods.  Also, to steal a phrase from Firesign Theater, that everything you know [about history] is wrong.  You have to be willing to accept that in this alternative universe Xena was the pivotal figure in the Battle of Actium, that it was Xena impersonating Cleopatra who ensnared Marc Antony, and that all the members of both triumvirates were engaged with one another at the same time.  Furthermore, you have to believe that a warrior can make 50 foot forward somersaults.  I'll confess that I found the history a bit easier to take over time, but I was never able to find anything like a comfort level with the wirework that made the absurd jumps possible.  I was much more comfortable with the kind of fighting and stunts found on BUFFY, which resembled more the real world.  Or KILL BILL, in which Zo Bell, Lucy Lawless's stunt double in XENA, doubled Uma Thurman.  But some fans never struggle believing anything they see in XENA.  And there is nothing wrong with that.

The great thing for all fans, regardless of their capacity for suspension of disbelief, is that unlike the relatively flat Season Four, this season was fully back on track.  And the arcs begun in the second half of the season were played out through Season Six until the end of the entire series.",1186963200,9,5748,4.729919678714859

2116440,5,B0002RQ2S0,"I didn't see too many episodes of this particular season of Xena when it was on tv.  I was a 10th grader in Highschool and had too much work to do, but I remember being facinated that the writers were actually planning to put an end to the gods.  I think the first episode from the fifth season I'd seen was God Fearing Child which I absolutely loved.  My drama instructor, who knew a heck of alot more about both Herc and Xena than I did and probably ever will because she's such a big fan, helped me out with all the questions I had concerning previous episodes.  I'd seen most of the episodes dealing with Hercules and Zeus thanks to her letting me borrow some of them, and I enjoyed the final battle between father and son.  I wish we could have seen Hercules again after Gfc, and in a way I guess we kinda did in those modern day episodes, but still, I would have loved to see Herc helping Xena out in the three part finale of this season.  I mean, wasn't he full god then?  And what the heck happened to Hera?

  I was shocked when I learned of Callisto's final character development this season.  But it was a welcome one.  She had suffered so much, and yeah, I shed a few tears when she was finally reunited with her family and free of the hatred after so many years.  I'd have loved to see her in a few more episodes.  She makes a very interesting protagonist.

  I wish Xena could have fought a bit more with Discord Damos and Hades before destroying them.  Yeah, I might not know what's going on half the time, but I enjoy mortals beating the stuffing out of Olympians as much as the next blind guy.  All that to say this.  A terrific season, but I wanted more!  No complaints save that one.",1155340800,,1702,4.207430340557275
2116441,1,B0002RQ2S0,"The worst Xena season ever put to film.

The X-Files managed to pull off its last two seasons mostly without the appearance of David Duchovny as Fox Mulder.  It worked, as well, because the writers continued to give us good stories and characters we could care about.

Why the ""powers that be"" didn't do a similiar thing with this season of Xena is beyond me.  Just because Lucy Lawless became pregnant didn't mean that Xena had to be with child, it just didn't make any sense.  We could have had a season that was ""Xena light,"" giving Ms. Lawless the time to have her baby, only to bring her back later.  It could have worked.  The X-Files made it work.

The ""twilight of the gods"" story arc was awful and didn't make any sense to me.  There were a lot of things that bothered me concerning Xena's quest to save her daughter.  It struck me as extremely hypocritical that she would easily come to Eve's defense while in the seasons past she didn't allow for Hope to be redeemed.  Gabrielle's daughter deserved to die but hers didn't?  Hope, just by being the daughter of Gabrielle, could have had some redeeming qualities.  Of course, Xena would never allow that such a thing were possible.

Too bad.  It was a good thing season six was better because I had written off the series after this season.",1150934400,6,1299,4.4914529914529915
2116442,3,B0002RQ2S0,"Xena's fourth season (arguably the best season next to the third) ended with the shocking death of the Warrior Princess and her best friend Gabrielle via crucifixion by order of Julius Caesar who's death also followed theirs in the so famous ""stabbing"" provided to him by his would-be faithful Romans and long time friend Brutus. From there Season Five opens with a rather impressive first episode ""Fallen Angel"" which highlights' Xena and Gabrielle's near ascension to the pearly white gates of God (or The God Of Light in this series) only to be deterred by a horde of Devils led by the maniacal Callisto, who skillfully separates the duo. The season opener was amazing, however, this cannot be said about Xena's fifth season. If anything the writers fumbled miserably with the Warrior Princess' character and the storylines themselves. Perhaps and as harsh and irrational as it may sound to others, Lucy Lawless picked a lousy time to get pregnant.

Seriously, her pregnancy basically killed whatever hopes this season had of carrying on the ""excellent streak"" the series had. Nothing about season five was very coherent in the ways that the previous and last season was: If anything it focused perhaps far too much of Gabrielle with Lawless being pregnant and her character near useless in series until her child's birth. I felt as though they tired far too hard to force on us the ""warrior path"" Gabrielle had chosen, and the character herself became lost in the muddle of the so called ""evolution"" thrown at me, curtesy of the writers. While, yes, Gabrielle finally being able to defend herself is always a plus, her sudden ability of combat and use of the Sai's were unlogical. Despite the fact that she indeed rode with Xena for Four years, Gabrielle is never shown taking a bit of interest in Xena teaching her fighting skills (it was quite the opposite in fact). The petty squabbles between Xena and Gabrielle were arbitrary drama, especially in episodes like ""Seeds of Faith"" or ""Succession"" and ""Back in the Bottle,"" all of which were dull episodes. ""The Twilight Of The Gods"" story arc was probably the best out the entire season, aside from the occasional glitch in the system with the storyline (The Miraculous conception of Xena's baby because she saves Callisto from torment in Hell and the sudden power to kill Gods, given to her by a messenger of a GOD himself. I mean, what gives ""God"" in Xena?).

That aside, all twenty-two minus episodes were like episode fillers surrounding Gabrielle since Xena's pregnancy was something to poke fun at with a stick. From getting writers block in ""Punch lines"" - to becoming Goldie Hawn in ""Married with Fishsticks,"" the so called evolution of Gabrielle from peace loving side kick with a staff to demi-warrior with Ralphel's twin sai's is lost in the haze shameless humor and arbitrary drama concerning the character. When baby Eve is born, its all breast-feeding and running from the Gods of Olympus for the Warrior Princess who finally steps back into the limelight as a fighter, but a fighter who has become consideringly meek and more geared to pleading with Ares and others to save her child, compared to how she was previously. Other characters of the series are immediately killed off as the series since their presence are not important to the writers nor the series any longer. A more prominent example is in the episode ""Eve"" - Joxer is killed straight away by Xena's evil daughter, Liva ""champion of Rome,"" without remorse. Indeed the worse thing is his getting killed is that he was in the middle of Xena's attempt to rescue Gabrielle herself! While this never occured to me during the viewing, I realize its a lousy way to kill off a character. In spite of his annoying demeanor, his death was indeed held shock value. I would've felt perhaps worse for the Gods if they had not changed a majority of the actors with unrecognizable actors with the exception of ""Discord,"" - ""CGI Poseidon,"" and ""Athena,"" who I felt worse for at the season finale than anything (Athena, I mean).

The character Liva/Eve would've been a great catalyst for the show as well if the writers had paid more attention to detail to the ""why"" this character did a ""Callisto and Xena"" and slaughtered Eli's followers for Rome. Instead in the course of the episode following ""Livia"" (""Eve"") we are thrown a horrible ending for the dark side of the character. Her being shown the light by the powers of Eli's spirit and suddenly accepting her rightful name and weeps over her evil deeds screams ""last minute writing."" However, S5 manages to redeem itself with a gripping episode like ""Motherhood"" which showcases Xena using ruthless force to protect her guilt-ridden daughter from all enemies, including her best friend. Xena hitting Gabrielle with her chakram instead of choosing the later is in itself is creepy and almost hard concept to grasp, given the relationship between Xena and Gabrielle, but understandable if you look at from a desperate mother's point of view. While ""Motherhood"" was riddled with plot problems ultimately tying with the Furies and Destruction of the Gods save two and others, it showcased some of the best action scenes this season EVER! Other positives of Season of Five include the appearance of Hercules (Kevin Sorbo) in ""God fearing Child"" and Alti (Claire Standsfield?) in ""Them Bones, Them Bones.""

The only thing I did like about this season is Gabrielle. She's completely capable of taking care of business  by now. Sadly this season isn't at all focused on her, its completely focused on the magicians known as Gods getting their butts kicked by a MORTAL Xena.

2116463,5,B0002RQ2S0,"This was An Unbelievable Season!
 Personally Season 5 was one of my favorite Seasons out of the entire Series Of Xena! Left off with The Cliffhanger Season 4 Closer with the electifying ""Ides of March"" where Xena and Gabrielle were left cruscifed by the romans and supposeldly became angels. We were all thinking... They're Dead... what? But Nope Season 5 Opener ""Fallen Angel"" was the astonishing conclusion of the cliffhanger. In the Episode there are Angles, and Demons, make-up and costumes were remarkable! In Season 5 Xena finds out the shocking news that she is carrying a baby of mysterious origns, that may put the end to the Olympic Gods...Forever! Season 5 Is Jam-packed with witty humor. betrayal, action, friendship, and sadness. One of My Favorite Episodes is ""Lyre, Lyre, Hearts On Fire"" the staggering musical. With Ted Raimi, and Lucy Lawless. I have to tell you that this is such an awesome money it's worth just the $50.00! That's how good it is! As Xena carries her child, Gabrielle has to defend Xena and protect her child. You can see the Relationship of Xena and Gabrielle grow as you grow with them. In the Season Gabrielle and Xena are frozen in an Ice Cove for 25 years! As that time passes, ""Eve"" or ""Livia"" becomes a fierce warrior which Xena once was. ""Livia"" threatens to kill Xena, you see their unwinding battle of there relationship. The Season Ends With The Miraculous ""Motherhood""!
 In the DVD Package, you recieve Interviews by Lucy Lawless, Renee O'Connor, Ted Raimi, Rob Tapert, Steven L. Sears, and Much Much More! You Get Bloopers, Behind The Scenes. An Exclusive CD-ROM with Chronicles, Actor/ Director Information, and Trivia!

2116464,5,B0002RQ2S0,"Season five was set to be ground-breaking from the very first episode, ""Fallen Angel"" which continued on from the climatic fourth season episode ""The Ides of March"" which left our heroines dead, crucified by the Romans. ""Fallen Angel"" puts Xena and Gabrielle through heaven and hell, literally!! Angels, Demons, heavenly realms, beautiful costumes and effects, not to mention the powerful script make the episode soar. It's hard to believe that the Xena producers could possibly follow a season opener like that but they continue to amaze the audience with a season that does just that. Season five sees Xena pregnant, carrying a baby that is said to bring about the end of the Olympian gods - another trip to China - the death of two beloved characters: Joxer and Eli - a new chakram - a 25year time skip and then there's the legendary fifth season musical ""Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire"".  This musical extravaganza has the cast singing and dancing up a storm, especially Ted Raimi as Joxer's larger-than-life twin brother Jace.  Including versions of `Dancing in The Moonlight' `Sisters Are Doing It For themselves' `War' and Joseph Lo Duca's incredible musical talent; ""Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire"" makes for some incredibly entertaining viewing. The episode is topped off with an outtake of a very pregnant Lucy Lawless dancing in Gabrielle's go-go outfit, during the credits.

As with every Xena season, season five follows Xena and Gabrielle's friendship and has many touching moments, as well as some hilarious ones. We once again witness Gabrielle's character progression, as she embarks upon her new warrior path; protecting Xena and her baby daughter Eve from the dangers they find themselves in almost everyday of their action-packed lives. We follow them as they travel from Italy to Greece, China, Egypt and in the case of ""Married With Fishsticks"" to an underwater fantasy world where Gabrielle is a fish wife, literally!!

The season concludes in the innovative way in which it began with the immensely dramatic episode ""Motherhood"". In which Xena receives the power to kill gods - Gabrielle is plagued by the Furies - Xena kills most of the Olympian gods - Gabrielle stabs Eve - Xena cuts open Gabrielle's head with her chakram - Ares kills his sister Athena and gives up his immortality to save Gabrielle and Eve...now if that isn't drama then I don't know what is!!

Season five is possibly the most dramatic, astonishing season of Xena to be realesed onto DVD to date. A must Buy set!!",1096761600,21,2501,4.959427207637232
2116465,5,B0002RQ2S0,"I urge people to buy Xena Season 5 DVD set. There are really great episodes the first episode of the season Fallen Angel takes place after seasons four cliffhanger episode Ides of March it takes you on an adventure through heaven and hell and how a friends love is worth everything and how forgiveness of others helps you in many ways. The next episode Chakram is so cool Gabriellle gets a new sexy outfit and new weapons called sais.

This season shows Gabrielle as a kick butt woman she is now the main fighter who helps Xena because she is pregnant. There is a musical episode called Lyre Lyre Hearts on Fire where Xena and Gabrielle Joxer and Draco and other characters compete in a Battle of the Bands contests. The birth of Xenas baby Eve and how events take place that change Xena and Gabrielle's lives forever. Join the adventures with Xena and Gabrielle and buy Xena Season Five.

Xena Season Five has cool extras especially the Audo commentary on alot of the episodes by the Xena Stars special bloopers and behind the scenes extravaganza.",1096588800,,1048,4.629032258064516
2116466,5,B0002RQ2S0,"This has to be one of the best seasons that Xena has had. From the begining episode of Fallen Angel . . . the unexpected things happen between Callisto and Xena to the finale of killing of the gods. So many things happen to xena and gabby; like the new chakram, to gabby's sais. Eve/livia, death of some good friends, Alti, who's baby is Xena carrying ect....great episodes like Fallen Angel, Chakram, Amphipolis under siege, and many more. This is a 'musthave' in any Xena collection. If you wanna know who got XEna pregnant, what finally happens to Callisto and Alti, who dies and the like . . . you must get this Season, and if you already know, what better way to re-live the excitment, the sorrow over and over again than by buying it :) highly recommend, also contains interviews and bloopers, commentary by our beloved actors. I say GET IT NOW!!!!",1096329600,,854,4.5519480519480515
2116467,5,B0002RQ2S0,"WOW!! Season 5... This season is completely amazing. One of my personal favorites! In this Season you find the shocking news that Xena Is Pregnant with a child of questionable origions. From the Amazing Season opener ""Fallen Angel"" to The Season ender, ""Motherhood"" it is jam packed with witty humore, sadness, betrayal, and lots of action! One Of my Favorite Things about this season is that Gabrielle can defend herself. In the past seasons Xena would defend her and now Gabrielle can do it herself,, and so good! A couple of My favorite episodes are ""Lyre, Lyre, hearts on fire"", ""Chakram"", ""Livia"", ""Eve"", and ""Motherhood""!

This Is a Breathtaking season, and it's a must have. It's Well Worth The Money. A MUST for any Xena fan, even if your not a Xena fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!!",1096243200,,789,4.717391304347826

Now,she & Gabrielle must  battle those who want to kill her unborn baby and there is good reason:the child's birth will mean the end of the gods! Kevin Sorbo plays Hercules one final time and finds an unlikely ally in his quest to stop Zeus from killing Xena's baby and the last person he would have expected help from-Hera! Once the baby comes, Xena & Gabrielle must risk their lives to keep her alive,even to the point of faking their deaths,but that leads to unexpected problems for Xena and her daughter!
