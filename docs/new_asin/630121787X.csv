322725,5,630121787X,This movie was filmed in the small town where I grew up and it was fun to look back in time at the area and people I knew back then.,1404345600,4,132,3.433333333333333
322726,5,630121787X,"Elliot Gould was a victim of the Committee of Un-american Activities.
This movie is a revenge against the dark years of McCarthy.
You may want to complement it with MASH (The original movie, not the miniseries) and ""Guilty by Suspicion""",1391817600,,236,4.925
322727,5,630121787X,A great comedy. Good cast and entertainingly goofy. Another thanks to Warner Brothers for archiving this one. Glad to find it on Amazon.com,1386374400,,139,5.086956521739131
322728,4,630121787X,it is an old one but I still think it is funny. Kids can watch it as well not sure if they would get what it is really about depending on the age of child. I would still recommend it.,1382227200,,183,3.6
322729,5,630121787X,"I truly funny, funny movie with great performances. This movie really never made it and it was very difficult to find a copy to purchase. Some of the scenes are wonderful, as is the opening scene with Gould tramping to a target.  I only hope this movie is not lost in history.",1356134400,,276,4.3076923076923075
322730,4,630121787X,"I've been looking for this film for years. It was great to find it through Amazon. The only drawback was it only being on VHS. Slightly inconvienient but not unrepairable. Compairing the story lines with the declassified records of experments on ""REAL PEOPLE"" was interesting at the least. How the material was handled by those involved was top scale Entertainment.",1168905600,3,365,5.1
322731,1,630121787X,"I watched this movie being filmed as did pretty much everyone else in Tooele, Utah.  It was exciting, like the biggest thing ever to happen in Mayberry.  But when the movie came out I think we all wanted to destroy every copy made.  It was just awful.  We wanted to like it but it just wasn't funny.  Perhaps that had something to do with the facts this movie was based on.  Prior to the film, a large number of animals had been killed by a poison gas leak nearby.  Maybe that memory spoiled it.
However, one local extra stole the show.  Paula Argus was standing in line ahead of Gould in a bank.  She was truly the best thing in the movie.
I own this movie simply for the nostalgia.  It is a part of my personal history.  Otherwise I can't think of any reason to own it, rent it or watch it.",1068768000,5,792,4.111111111111111
7810556,5,630121787X,I remember watching this movie while on B-52 alert 40 years ago -- it was funny then -- still fun to watch,1494028800,,106,3.8636363636363638

7810562,5,630121787X,I LOVE THAT MOVIE! IT CAME IN ON TIME EVERTHING FINE THANKS,1439337600,,59,4.0
7810563,2,630121787X,"Preceding the opening credits the makers of the film proudly herald that this film was made without the cooperation of the U.S. military establishment.  My first thought was this was another post-Vietnam anti-military film in the mode of ""M*A*S*H"".  Before you get your dander up what is offered onscreen  is so insignificant and negligible as to give mediocrity a bad name.  This is an enterprise made wholly out of cynicism designed to burn your brain cells.  Don't waste your time on this forgettable tripe.  Anthrax is preferable.",1438300800,,534,5.080459770114943
7810564,4,630121787X,"I saw this movie years ago and always thought it was very funny.  Elliott Gould is great---while it has no redeeming value as educational or life altering, it will make you laugh.",1435449600,,179,4.59375
7810565,5,630121787X,"Great older video...funny, and some truth to it concerning the government utilizing people as guinea pigs...I can most certainly relate.  I purchased the DVD solely out of a nostalgic beckoning.  It is worth the purchase to those folks whom are collectors.  The acting is good, with some humor, truth, and sarcastic rhetoric woven into the entire film.",1434931200,,352,5.140350877192983
