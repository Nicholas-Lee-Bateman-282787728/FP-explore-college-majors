3715026,5,B000YV1KUE,"Good workout , don't think it's for beginners, makes you sweat , it's kinda fast but gives you a good workout",1395014400,2,109,4.238095238095238
3715027,3,B000YV1KUE,"Billy Blanks Tae Bo Power with Weighted Gloves showcases one of Billy's newer accoutrements to his usual Tae Bo workouts.  The gloves weigh about three quarters of a pound each and wrap around your hands with two Velcro fasteners.  Most of the workout--which lasts for around 67 minutes-- revolves around punches and arm exercises, so if you are looking for a complete Tae Bo workout that includes kicks and other leg movements, look elsewhere.  Billy does a few knee raises and that's about it--his main goal is to make use of the weighted gloves.

The pace of the video is okay and Billy, thankfully, does not include any complicated and less than smooth combination moves.  The arm exercises are fairly straightforward and will stress the muscles especially if you add a small pair of dumbbells to pump it up a bit.

Billy devotes fifteen more minutes in a separate segment to abdomen exercises.  He uses seated moves in a chair and standing moves to illustrate that getting on your back is not necessary to work these muscles.

Of course, the weighted gloves may be used with other Tae Bo tapes that do focus on a more complete routine that includes leg moves.  These gloves are not washable, so I imagine that once they get ""sweaty/smelly"" they will need to be replaced.

Bottom line?  The Weighted Gloves in Billy Blanks Tae Bo Power were worth the purchase, but the overall workout is too focused on arms.  I would have liked a more even workout that worked out my legs, too.

3715028,3,B000YV1KUE,"I'm a Tae Bo fan, and have tried quite a few of the workouts.  This workout being live, is a different experience.  I got an uneven workout, either only one side was worked or I missed the cues to switch sides.  If you are looking for a new Tae Bo workout I would look at a different one.",1388016000,2,288,3.9310344827586206
3715029,5,B000YV1KUE,she loves it so far she has several of the tae bo workouts and has said this one is one of his best  and the gloves are much easier than the bar one of the previous ones came with but is just as good of a workout . best part is you don't have to worry about breaking anything when your swinging the bar around .,1387065600,,311,3.712121212121212
3715030,5,B000YV1KUE,"I already owned weighted gloves, so I am only reviewing the dvd.
This workout really makes your arms feel it! I like doing this one once a week, and you can really feel the results the next day! I enjoy this workout and highly recommend it.

3715032,5,B000YV1KUE,I love Tae-bo workout videos and these just keep getting better.  This video challenges me more than the previous videos did and helped me get back in shape and lose 15 stubborn pounds.  I highly recommend this video and the other videos of his.  I have been a fan of Tae-bo workouts since the late nineties and they have helped me lose weight and keep it off after each of my pregnancies.,1332979200,8,389,4.375

8325953,3,B000YV1KUE,You will definitely get a good workout with this DVD I mean I love Billy Blanks only problem is he doesn't seem to take in to consideration that some people may be on the heavier side or beginners and he doesn't offer moderations to certain exercises that are hard to do for these reasons. I would say get this DVD but expect not to be able to do all of it until you are somewhat use to it but please don't give up.,1463529600,,415,4.0120481927710845
8325954,4,B000YV1KUE,"The overall workout is great, fast paced with easy combos but I'm assuming for the purpose of the gloves (which are great especially if you're a woman) this video is primary focused on arms.
