8599299,4,B0016LHH5S,"NOT a ""Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program (What's this?)"" -

But another from a CLAMP fan who's actually INTERESTED in the story!  ( Have you noticed how the number of reviews have fallen drastically once the interlopers have been eliminated? )

Once again we have the latest ""collection"" of four xxxHOLiC episodes.  ( Am I the only one BOTHERED by that desigination for these DVD's - it sounds like it should be at least a COMPLETE season, not just the usual next set of episodes? )  And again the Dimensional Witch Yuko continues to weave a spell around not only her ""part-time employee"" Watanuki, but at the same time involves both his ""love interest"" Himawari and his ""rival"" Doumeki.

Doumeki becomes even more important in this ""collection"", both to help Watanuki by fending off ghosts as usual; but also to in turn be helped by him when Ame-warishi, a timid household sprite and friend of vol. 2's rain spirit, becomes infatuated.  It almost proves fatal to the uncomprehending Doumeki, whose soul is about to be forfit as a result of the contact, thereby forcing Watanuki to intercede.  Yuko has a penchant for including both Doumeki and Himawari in their adventures, inviting both first to a seance of sorts at Doumeki's family temple; then for a seaside outing at a beachfront summer cottage.  It's made even more evident that Doumeki is the antidote to Watanuki's continuing problem of attracting various ghosts, sprites, and spirits; but Himawari's connection in the mix remains the open question. Thus far a lesser character, she is at least accepting of Yuko and her weird surroundings, and has positively adopted Mokona as an acceptable friend; so she obviously has at least an affinity for the supernatural herself.

The interaction of these four main characters remains the big draw for fans of this series.  Although the ""monster-of-the-week""-type stories are for the most part entertaining enough, it is the reaction and developing relationship between the mysterious Yuko and her young friends that forms the basis for continuing interest.  Those who like lots of fast-paced action, sappy romance, or oceans of blood are not likely to stick around to see what happens in this rather dark and slowly developing series.  ( Maybe that's what happened to all the ""Amazon Vine"" reviewers? )",1238198400,,2319,5.0078125
8599300,4,B0016LHH5S,"There is still more than half of xxxHolic season one to go and so I am not convinced that the character development on this volume is a sudden trend. I assume that as we start working out way through the middle of this season, the series will continue its slow hinting style until the audience is much closer to the conclusion. Still, the series manages to redeem itself with these episodes by proving that the production staff does have something that resembles a plan so far. While I am hoping that we will at least get more frequent hints, this volume proves far more entertaining than the previous two and has regained my interest.",1218585600,,635,4.578947368421052
8599301,4,B0016LHH5S,"This collection isn't as good as one and two but it is good.  I became interested in XXXHolic after receiving the first disk through the Amazon Vine program.  I have read all the books so far and am a big fan!  In this disk we have a girl who must face the fact she has been stringing a number of men around, Watanuki discovers why Domenki is actually good for him but wonders why it has to be him.  Yuko continues to fix Watanuki as well.",1217376000,,439,4.069767441860465
