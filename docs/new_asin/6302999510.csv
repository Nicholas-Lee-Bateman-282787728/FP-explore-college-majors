7901098,3,6302999510,"I orginally saw this as a Showtime Special back in the '80s. That special was great. Got to see everyone perform. From Hank himself to Earl Thomas conley, to Gus Harden, Mel McDaniel, Waylon Jennings & Jessie Colter, Dickie Betts & Alabama.
This version is good but not great as it is edited with most of the performances removed. Don't get me wrong, it's a good show but it could have been great had it been released as it was shown on Showtime.",1346889600,2,446,4.385542168674699
