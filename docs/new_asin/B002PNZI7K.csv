8377184,3,B002PNZI7K,"For Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill fans it's a must, you'll get some good films and some not so good. People just want to see the ones with the best fights and rumbles. As far as the quality, some are pretty good while some look like horrible VHS transfers. It's really a mixed bag, but for the price I paid it was worth it. Got some good films out of it. Be warned it's a European release... If you plan on watching these discs in North American, make sure you have a compatible DVD player.",1403222400,,490,4.168421052631579

8377186,3,B002PNZI7K,"I remember watching Bud Spencer and Terence Hill movies back when I was a kid. They were entertaining in a non-committal kind of way, and they live up to that.

The films in this box are in varying degrees of quality, but hey, you sure do get a lot of them! I'd honestly only recommend this if you grew up watching these guys or are interested in semi-obscure Italian westerns/action/comedy movies. And have a device that lets you watch region 2 discs.",1335830400,,452,4.512195121951219
