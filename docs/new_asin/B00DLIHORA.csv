Amazon (Thank You) upon contacting them was quick to put things to right. Otherwise, this is as I remembered from my older teen years, the mid-late 70's of hanging out near China Town and going to the movie theater to see martial arts flicks. In those days it would be at least 2 movies shown and sometimes 3, back to back and for just a few bucks too and you could buy real buttered popcorn then!!",1389225600,,614,4.082644628099174
