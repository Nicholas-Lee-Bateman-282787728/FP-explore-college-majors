8175998,2,B000NA1WCM,"After having previously seen Sallah Shabati and HaShoter Azulai, both directed by Kishon, I was hoping this movie would deliver more of the same.  While true it does feature Topol as the main character, in this role I simply cannot get to like the person he portrays.  This may be due to some of the cultural and generational differences between my time and that of the movie, but I had no such complaints with the other two movies mentioned.
I found the plot to be jumpy, and that's when it can be followed at all.  I couldn't make it through the first viewing without having my attention waver and finding myself bored and annoyed.  It is as if a collection of 3 minute skits were compiled into a full length movie, with little discernible character growth or plot hinges.
To sum up, unless you happen to have a cult fascination with any of the creators of this movie, I would recommend keeping a distance and trying your luck with other offerings.",1272499200,,950,4.538011695906433
