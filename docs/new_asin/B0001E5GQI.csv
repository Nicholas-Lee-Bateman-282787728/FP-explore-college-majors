1993508,4,B0001E5GQI,"I'm not sure what the quality of the VHS will be. It seems to be in pristine shape with a photo copy insert in the plastic case and for a video that was found at a yard sale, I'm a bit skeptical. I think this rather looks like someone has copied the show on this tape and put off that it was ""discovered."" However, I wanted the tape for my wife who watched the show as a youth and has fond memories. Whether it's real or dubbed matters not. Quick service. After ordering I received it in a few days.",1228089600,,499,4.0
1993509,4,B0001E5GQI,"Although this version doesn't follow the original story exactly, it sure makes a better effort than most.  I remember being delighted with this film as a child (I think I saw it for the first time on the Wonderful World of Disney.), and I wanted to share it with my daughter, who is entering the horse-crazy years.  She was as enchanted with it as I was, even though the film is clearly dated and not what she is used to.  I recommend it for anyone who loves this story--or who has a kid who loves horses.",1201478400,,505,4.239583333333333

1993511,4,B0001E5GQI,"This movie lightly fictionalizes the birth of one of the first American horse breeds, the Morgan. Named for its founder, a Colonial schoolteacher named Justin Morgan (Don Murray), the breed's foundation sire was a versatile little bay called Figure because he was such a ""fine figure of a horse."" The multi-talented equine could pull a carriage, do hard labor, carry a rider for miles in comfort, and win trotting and running races. Several Morgans portrayed Figure throughout the stages of his life, but the filmmakers did a good job of matching the animals.

1993527,5,B0001E5GQI,"This childhood movie not a true tale of Figure...you need to read the Morgan Horse history BUT family clean and enjoyable with many tale that is close to what history records about the horse.  It led me to buy my first Morgan Mare, Pristina's Diana Redwood.  My daughter was raised on that mare and never a more safer breed if you follow the Quietude bloodlines.  On her sire side she was 14 generations from Figure.  Smart beyond any horse that I've ever had the pleasure of owner.  Due to a divorce I lost her but she was my first, not my last.  If you want a child safe, bomb proof, animal for riding and thinks for itself yet is gentle enough to allow your 9 year old to lay bareback in a 100 acre field while she east grass and your 9 year old is laying on her back on the horse's back (stretched out no less) while reading a book for hours then look into the Lambert bloodlines of the Morgan Horse.  I could tell you many stories all true.  We had 7 & 8 year old children training on her before she was 3 herself.  MORGAN HORSES RULE!  I found Tina after if researched for 2 years for a horse that would keep my ""boo-boo, band-aide daughter"" safe.  I found the Lambert Morgans in West Virginia which had tight crosses within 13 generations of Figure.  The owners are honest, knowledgeable, and a deep respect for this little horse ""Figure"".  So if you want a great Disney flick for the family, and inspire dreams in your little ones you can't go wrong with this movie.",1468281600,2,1474,4.297101449275362

I first viewed this on TV and was struck by the beauty of the Morgan horse as personified by the horse used in the film. Even though I was very young, I started to research the lineage of my grandfather's mare (she was black as night, gentle yet spirited, and was worked in the fields, pulled wagons, up-rooted stumps in harness,and ridden to hunt and pleasure). She displayed all of the breed characteristics of the Morgan and soon I discovered her breeding lineage. This film inspired me. I found that my grandfather's mare was linked to the foundation sire of the Morgan, ""Figure!"" The Morgan is still my breed of choice. Now that I am past retirement and the mare is gone, I view this film and joyously remember! A wonderful family film.",1376179200,,825,4.470198675496689

It's rare that something loved in innocence can survive being viewed in adulthood uneffected by the reality of life.

1993646,5,B0001E5GQI,"Love this movie. Wonderful classic Disney film, from before they stuffed films with junk and gas jokes.

That being said, I agree with other reviewers: Disney's PC removal of the pub scene (when the pub was the centre of culture in America for 400+ years) is laughable. What, they're afraid little kids will start hanging out at bars because of a scene in a movie set 200 years ago? Why not worry that they'll take up the dangerous sport of horse-racing? ...Of course, then there'd be no movie...why no worries that kids will act like Bruce the Shark in Finding Nemo? Where'd the editing of that go?

Silly Disney. Kids aren't stupid. This movie is about the origin of the Morgan horse- warts and all. Great movie, a classic. My kids love it. And yet they don't run around threatening to sell horses for skins or fining each other a day's pay for watching a horse race...gee, I guess kids are smarter than Disney's PC executive board.",1346716800,6,934,4.586826347305389

Justin Morgan Had A Horse is a great movie for a 'family-night'. (Even my hubby sat through it with me!) It may not be perfectly scripted and filmed, but it's a fun movie if you enjoy horses. The first American horse breed was a dynamite package. The horse that was used as 'Figure' was a super model in this movie. I appreciated the 'clean' romance going on with school teacher and the woman. There are some good historic depictions of that colonial time that are great for kids to see.",1339545600,,622,4.5625

I not only own an original Disney VHS copy, but a DVD copy a friend made for me off of the Disney Channel. The beginning of this DVD does not include the few minutes of history and current use of the Morgan breed of horse that was included in the original movie. I haven't played the whole movie yet, but I hope more isn't ""cut"" from it. I'm so glad that Disney is FINALLY releasing their old classics on DVD format- including other favorites of mine- ""The Horse With the Flying Tail"" & ""The Waltz King"" but I'm hoping that these DVDs won't be ""cut"" from the originals.

1993672,4,B0001E5GQI,"There is only one little bit of disappoint that I could find with the Generations release of this DVD, and that is that this is not the full 91 minute release, but rather the 88 minute version that was released by Disney Educational Products for school classroom use. The basic story is there but with references to drinking/alcohol edited out. Unfortunately this eliminates the reason that the ride to the tavern (from where Figure pulled the log) was a race. Knowing what was in the original release makes this scene seem a little awkward, but if you haven't seen the original, you probably won't realize that something is missing. But an edited release is still better than no release. Let's hope that Disney doesn't do the same thing with Light in the Forest if it is ever released on DVD to the general public (as with Justin Morgan Had a Horse, an edited DVD is available from Disney Educational Products). So the bottom line is that this DVD is definitely worth owning if you don't have the DEP DVD, but still hang on to your VHS copy if you have one.",1334707200,11,1058,4.544502617801047

Until just recently, this was only available for purchase by teachers through Disney's educational division.  It's about the Morgan horse breed and its origin.  It shows a man struggling to accomplish something he can't easily do.  It shows a man overcoming peer pressure, a horse triumphing over the odds, and a second man triumphing over greed.
If you prefer explosions, car chases, intricate plot twists, or vulgarity, this one's not for you.  It's a real, old-fashioned Disney, complete with happy ending.  And FINALLY available to the public on DVD.",1331424000,8,706,4.940677966101695
