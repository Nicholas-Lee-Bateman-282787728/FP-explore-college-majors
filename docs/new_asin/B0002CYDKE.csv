This picture opened in the summer of 1965 starring William Wellman as Rick, James Stacey as Mickey, Quinn O'Hara as Cindy and the debut of Raquel Welch as Jeri. Rick, Mickey and Cindy are on there way to Lake Arrowhead for summer jobs when it comes across the radio that the Pavilion will be closed and that they no longer have work. The kids decide to ask Mr. Johnson if they could run the Pavilion themselves with Mr. Johnson getting half the profits. Therefore, the gang gets things started when Turk decides that he wants Cindy and decides to provide the pavilion with plenty of trouble. Now as far as the debut of Raquel Welch it was a slam-dunk.  Her body was enough to make you see through the entire movie. Her Stage scene was out of this world. Based on Raquel Welch alone I have no problem giving the movie 5 weasel stars. If you like watching Raquel Welch you love this movie because this was Raquel Welch first ever movie and all you can from there is a Star was born.",1200960000,5,1055,4.38265306122449
