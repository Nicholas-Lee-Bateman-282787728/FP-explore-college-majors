2633718,5,B000HC2M16,"A lot could be said about this somewhat neglected movie. Where Ethan a woman, situations would differ very little, perhaps with less skin. The plot centers on the difficulties of Ethan in finding Mr. Right, for, as was stated by another commentator, he looks for Mr. ALLright. Its a reality for many people, always in search of prince charming. This is told in a light, hilarious way. Ethan is surrounded by a cast of beauties (with a cutest David Monahan among them) and drops them all, for one reason or another, or simply for no reason at all.
A film that can be seen many times, with different moods and appreciation, bringing joy and, why not, some philosophical insights.",1442966400,,677,4.697478991596639

2633723,3,B000HC2M16,The description of the movie made it sound very entertaining. But in reality it was okay. I don't think the movie quite lives up to its description. The acting is okay and some of the comedic moments are too far over the top that it just comes across as absurd.,1419984000,,261,4.24

2633725,2,B000HC2M16,"I guess if you like films where 26 year old men act like 13 year old girls, this would be a great film.  Or if you were an isolated gay person in the wilds of Heterovania.  Or, if a pretty face, any pretty male face is worth watching.  One of the problems, many problems, I had with this film is that the lead Daniel Letterle---while handsome---plays the part with a reedy, whiny voice and a most unlikeable manner.  Aren't we supposed to root for him?  I found myself wishing Davis Monaghan would get more screen time.

It's light, fast paced, and has some skin but little about this film was able to hold my attention---and that's saying a lot when you're talking about low budget gay films.  The ""Eating Out"" series was perfectly stupid, badly acted, and, although it was loaded with naked pretty men (also acting a lot like teenage girls) was still more watchable.  In the end, I looked up the illustrated novel that inspired it---and could see how it got an audience.  The film seemed to pick out stuff that didn't make the transition to the screen.  I would think you'd have to be desperate, or high, to want to watch this film.  Then again, I never did understand why people thought Sarah Palin was so great, yet look at what a run she's had!",1406419200,,1249,4.434210526315789

2633748,5,B000HC2M16,Sometime everybody needs a little bit of fluffy romantic comedy.  This is cheesy but a feel good movie.  It won't win any Golden Globes but I enjoyed the movie a lot.  The hat aunts added a lot counterpoint humor.  I have not read the comic strip but the movie makes me want to go out and read the comic strip.

2633754,5,B000HC2M16,"This movie is a nice comedy without any purpose if not being funny. It's obviously on the edge, it has no wish to describe a ""real"" situation, and so it pushes on the hilarity, but for me it never slips on the trash (as some other movie that tried to do the same thing).",1278288000,,270,4.018518518518518
2633755,5,B000HC2M16,This Movie is a Must see for anyone who has been through a Gay coming of age experience and likes to reminisce all the drama of youth.  It is a very comical yet dramatic movie.  I really thought it was good and one to watch again and again.,1276041600,,240,3.9791666666666665

As all romantic comedies on a topic of family-establishment, it is a bit boring, predictable and over-humour-ised to a great extent.

Everything could happen with people independent financially from sources not clear.",1272672000,,366,5.7592592592592595
2633758,1,B000HC2M16,"This movie is driven, frenetic, and entirely without any charm or humor at all. I forced myself to keep watching to the very end, but it was like having teeth pulled by a chimpanzee on speed. I'm going to break the DVD so I won't forget and end up watching it again by mistake. This is the worst movie I've seen in a very, very long time.",1234483200,,338,4.059701492537314
2633759,2,B000HC2M16,"I bought and watched this film today based on the reviews of a number of people on this site, and I've got to say I was disappointed in the film and a bit surprised that many rated it so highly. Comparisons made between it and films like Broken Hearts Club are far too complimentary to this piece of predictable fluff.
Another constant rave was about how cute the actor playing Ethan was. Each to his own taste, of course, but I thought his ex., Leo, was a better sort. Few mentioned Letterle's acting ability, thankfully, which we thought was as flat as a pancake and very unengaging.
The strengths are the hat boys, the mother and the very occasional subtle joke such as the empty shelf for 'lesbian humour' literature in the early library scene.
The weaknesses were the hideous Republican & the seemingly inconsistent screenplay, especially on the main premise of Ethan's commitment-phobia.
Lastly, so many others commented on al the extras on the DVD yet all we got was a crappy photo gallery and trailers. It would've been nice to see the featurette on the comic strip that other reviewers have referred to.
And I paid more for this than I did for 'Shelter'! Ripped off!",1230940800,2,1175,4.653846153846154
2633760,3,B000HC2M16,"Protagonist Ethan Green is unable to commit, always secretly believing that someone better will come along. Eventually he's torn between three very different hunks vying for his affections.

Not as good as it sounds.

This is typical of every other formulaic gay romantic comedy of the last ten years. Like Jeffrey, Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss and The Broken Hearts Club, the characters in this film don't seem to have anything on their minds but their own gayness. They obsess on being gay. All the jokes are about being gay. All the cultural references are gay. All the locales are gay. All the careers are gay. Based on the comic strip of the same name, this is a mere trifle of a film. It'll pass the time and maybe give you an odd chuckle here or there, but ultimately it's very forgettable.

It's fairly competently acted and moves at a swift pace, but I felt as if I'd seen it all before. There's even, not one, but two (!) witty and wise old trannies. Only in modern gay Hollywood does the simple act of donning a dress automatically make a man wise. Trite.",1221264000,,1067,4.546875
2633761,3,B000HC2M16,"This movie premiered back in 2004 at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival and was highly anticipated by not only the gay community but the film industry at large due to actors and productions staff in the movie.

Although the movie lacked that magic to keep you intrigued all the way through, it certainly was a treat during many of it's moments. Seeing the lovely Mredith Baxter on the big screen was great, she played such a funny mom to Ethan (played by the sexy and gifted actor!)",1220918400,,479,4.505747126436781

2633764,5,B000HC2M16,I thought the movie was very funny and lighthearted.  It kept  your attention and interest right to the last.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and had to have it for my library.  One of the better Gay movies you want to keep.  I thought the cast was great. They all were cast correctly and made the characters their own.  Great job.,1214870400,,324,4.316666666666666
2633765,4,B000HC2M16,Love this film. Why is it we all live by crazy standards when it comes to love? Wouldn't we just screw up our lives and the people wanting to be involved in it? Ethan definitely knew all to well. Hot cast and funny. A good film to watch with friends or by yourself. Take a few pointers on what not to do.,1199923200,,304,3.9193548387096775
2633776,3,B000HC2M16,"I'm on two minds with this movie.

First of all, it was never made to be dissected in search for moving themes; it was made to entertain and make you laugh. Has this been accomplished? I say yes!

It's just a shame that it's a bit unrealistic at times and some of the acting seem forced.

So here lies the dilemma. Should you buy it?
I can't honestly say I regret buying it. I say rent it and decide if you're for the steamy kisses and hilarious backstories or the thin plot and substance.

Three stars out of five for The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green",1189209600,,567,4.222222222222222

He is a great actor, and us unbelievably hot.  There are some good characters in the story, but for the most part is it merely a camp-fest.  You have to really like cheesy gay-comedy to appreciate this movie. Luckily i worship Joan Crawford.",1187827200,,390,4.375

2633779,2,B000HC2M16,"Worth watching for an interesting, comic perspective on gay relationships and their regular ups and downs.  Not too tacky and very well cast.  The plot flows with ease and is not the least boring.  Full marks to the cast and crew, many of whom are not gay.  Cheers.  Looking forward to seeing more like these.",1186272000,,309,4.545454545454546
2633780,5,B000HC2M16,The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life Of Ethan Green is just a hoot. From the minute the film started me and my friends laughed all the way through it! I hardly every find a movie that does that! Production values are great and the situations are hilarious. This is one of the better films I have watched this year! I highly recommend this film if you want an upbeat funny evening!,1183852800,,377,4.4
2633781,5,B000HC2M16,see what one man dose to see the one he realy wants is right next to him and all the mistakes he makes to relize this,1182816000,,117,3.5384615384615383
2633782,4,B000HC2M16,"Though I'm not familiar with the comic strip on which this movie is based, I did watch the special feature by its author (Eric Orner) and if he's happy with the transition from pen and ink to live action film, then I'd suggest it was a success.  After all... who'd know better than him?  The overall story is about Ethan Green, a 26 year-old guy who continually sets himself up to fail in his relationships.

I've watched the film twice in the course of a week, because I was really intrigued by the stereotypes exhibited in the movie.  Ethan (played quite talentedly by Daniel Letterle) is characterized as a ""serial monogamist"" though his monagamy might only last a day or two as in the case of his fling with Punch Epstein, played by Dean Shelton.  Next, we have the lesbian roomate (strongly delivered by Shanola Hampton) who photoshops her former girlfriend out of all their pictures, replacing her with the picture of their cat!  We have a twink teenager, hunky ex-boyfriends (including a recently married baseball player played by Diego Serrano), a Log Cabin Republican and of course, the Hat Sisters (hilariously portrayed by Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle) who are based on real people in Massachusetts.

The stereotypes come in many ways, but mostly in the round-robin relationships shown by the gay men in their 20s (or in the case of Punch, almost 20s), but most stereotypes are borne in truth, so it does ring genuine in that respect.  What seems more wishful than real is the super-over-supportive mother played by Meredith Baxter.  She's an awesome actress, but the character is more gay-friendly than Debbie on Queer as Folk.

In listening to the commentary by the Director, Screenwriter and Exec Producer, you learn a lot about how they made this film on such a low budget and with the help of their friends.  At one point, the commentators actually wonder if anyone was still listening to their commentary - I was and it was very insightful - worth listening to if you have the time.

All in all, a fun film... a good way to spend an hour and a half.  A good deal of the cast is straight, which is a testament to their acting ability.  Letterle and Serrano specifically do very well in their parts which is not always the case when a straight actor plays gay.",1182124800,,2277,4.66
2633783,4,B000HC2M16,"I thought that this movie was pretty cute.  Daniel Letterle is an okay actor, however his performance was a bit, shall we say, shy of a 'real' personality.  I have seen it three times now since I have bought it 2 weeks ago.  It's just a cutecute movie.  The ending is kind of shocking though.  You think you are going to be left hanging but then it comes right back and ends somewhat satisfyingly, just okay.  I loved the cartoon storyline of the realtor in the movie.",1179878400,,468,4.32183908045977

Eye candy galore and good acting.  The director does a decent job covering up the fact that the film is low budget.  The story follows the protagonist through his disasterous love life, which is basically what the comic strip is about.  I especially enjoyed the supporting characters: the long suffering hunky ex-boyfriend, the protective ""aunties"" (the Hat Sisters), campy mother (nice to see Meredith back in action), a luscious lesbian roomate (love her), a deranged realator, a wide eyed twink who is anything but innocent, a gay republican businss man, and clueless Ethan.  Not great cinema (ending could be stronger, hence the 4 stars) but definately worth the cost of the dvd and holds its own with the likes of Trick, Adam and Steve, etc.",1168387200,2,919,4.735849056603773
2633813,1,B000HC2M16,"I loved the ""Ethan Green"" comic strip in the early 90s, and never really thought about what it would be like if it were a movie.  Even if I had, this wouldn't have been the movie I came up with.

Moving the action from Boston to LA doesn't affect things much, so I settled down to watch. Almost exactly twenty minutes into the movie, the character of Ethan makes an incredibly stupid move (an inconsistent move with his behavior and attitude in the PREVIOUS SCENE) and the film started to lose me.  The movie has a lot of problems with the storytelling and pace but the main problem is the casting.

Daniel Letterle is completely miscast as Ethan; he isn't able to carry the movie or make Ethan especially real. Letterle is also unable to muster up any chemistry with any of his co-stars, especially the equally miscast Dean Shelton as Punch.  Punch is supposed to be so cute that he's irresistible, but the character lacks the charisma necessary for the role as well as any sense of decent comic timing.  Every line Punch tosses off feels forced (when you can understand him) and from certain angles, he bears a startling resemblance to Hard Candy's Ellen Page.  Other characters remain underdeveloped and exist at the perimeter until they're needed.

The movie tries all kinds of wacky situations that don't come off well and even resorts to the old cliche of the person marrying somebody whom they don't love.  True, the twist this time is it's a same-sex ceremony but it still feels as tired as ever.

It's always nice to see Meredith Baxter doing something more than Lifetime movies, and Joel Brooks is perfect as one of the Hat Sisters but they alone aren't enough to redeem this movie.",1168041600,9,1692,4.62876254180602

2633815,3,B000HC2M16,"I must start by saying I am not a follower/reader of the comic strip version of which this movie is based.  That said, I had no pre-conceived notions when I sat down to watch this.  It was ok, nothing spectacular.  Based on the trailer previews, I expected something very funny and full of laughs, but wasn't delivered the goods.  Even Meredith Baxter (of the famed ""Family Ties"" TV sitcom) wasn't enough to take the movie to the next level.

I won't reiterate the storyline, as it is easy enough to read in the product description.

Ethan Green was probably one of my least favorite characters, well next to the roommate and real estate gal.  My favorite character (from an acting standpoint) was most likely Punch, the young 19-year old junior executive type guy.

When it was funny (the hat ladies), it was good, when it wasn't, it was just so-so.  Looking for laughter, I found more comical moments in ""Kiss Me Guido"" and ""Trick"", 2 films from the late 90's.

The DVD featured extra's, including a featurette about the comic strip by Eric Orner.  That was one of the highlights for me.  In fact, it made me think that this story simply did not transfer well from the comic strip to the big screen.  It wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't very good either.",1166659200,4,1258,4.5377777777777775

I found the film to be funny, sexy and quite relevant to today's dating issues. Letterle plays his character well, though sometimes a bit too much femme which comes off as rather cartoony. The Hat Sisters are indeed cartoonish but that is what makes them great! Meredith Baxter as Ethan's mom is a complete hoot!

The acting isn't 100% but hey, all of the actors are cute!  Daniel Letterle has come some way since Camp and even though he's fresh, he manages to pull off a very likeable character and even though he's sometimes over the top, convincingly plays a gay man (too bad he isn't!).

I highly recommend this movie for a bit of a chuckle and just some great light comedy.

2633830,4,B000HC2M16,"It's refreshing to see a lighthearted gay romantic comedy that delivers what it promises - a fun story with cute characters and plenty of light comedy.

Casting was done perfectly - while none of the characters requird Oscar-worthy performances, the cast members were well-suited for their roles.

I think that seeing more movies like this is an indication of where gay cinema - and the gay community - currently is.  That we are able to make fun movies that exist for no other reason than to entertain is a departure from the heavy, highly sociopolitical dramas that have dominated for much of the genre's history (i.e. Longtime Companion, And the Band Played On, Angels in America, etc).  All of those movies are brilliant and important, but it's nice to have some fun.

The plot has already been summarized, but I will point out that I didn't find any of the characters overly-stereotypical, especially not in the derogatory sense.  I know many people who are very much like the characters in this movie, and I think the somewhat sugar-coated point of the movie - that relationships are not easy but they do require tolerance, patience and ultimately two people who are very much self-aware and honest about who and what they are - was easy to digest.

Watch it with friends as an alternative to hitting the bars one night.",1162339200,19,1326,4.764192139737991
2633831,3,B000HC2M16,"What a cute premise with cute guys and a story that moves pretty quickly.  Even with Meredith Baxter giving an impressive and memorable performance as Ethan's witty and wise mother.

But the pieces don't fit together very well and it's sort of all over the place, never really making any point or much sense.  There is nothing here, really, that's very fresh or even very interesting.  Having followed some of the comic strip, I certainly enjoyed it more in that venue.

All told, it's not all bad, and is certainly worth a watch and good for a few light laughs, but there's always the sense that there's not much there besides the cute boys to be too entertained by.  There's lots better gay-themed stuff than this.",1162252800,2,716,4.642857142857143
2633832,3,B000HC2M16,"A funny line from a funny song, but somehow it captures the mood of this light little comedy, made with enough wit and ingenuity to keep our attention, rehashing some tired gay stereotypes with a fresh approach, and in the end just offering a pastiche that should find an appreciative audience. George Bamber takes on his first directing role and uses a comic strip (Eric Orner) translated for the screen by David Vernon and populates his movie with an attractive cast of men (and women) and ably manages to make the individual frames of a comic strip almost become a smooth storyline.

Ethan Green (the talented Daniel Letterle) has problems with relationships: he has been in many from Juarez (Ramon De Ocampo) who still lives with Ethan's gay boy loving mother Harper (Meredith Baxter), to previously closeted baseball player Leo (Diego Serrano), to Kyle (David Monahan) to the very young Punch (Dean Shelton).  The crux of the story revolves around the difficulty of selling Leo's house and the ways in which the various ex-lovers interact provides the somewhat frustrating line of dialogue.

Comic relief is supplied by two elderly gentlemen known as the Hat Sisters (Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle) as well as the shenanigans of the real estate people.  Of course we know from the beginning who will end up with whom, but the getting there is fairly fun. The cast obviously has such a good time with the film that they forget to enunciate and so much of the dialogue is swallowed.  But they are all fun  to watch so it matters little that the superficial aspects of the story remain sub rosa. Grady Harp, October 06",1162252800,,1621,4.792114695340501
2633833,4,B000HC2M16,"""The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green"" (2005) is a very light romantic comedy which does a commendable job in capturing the whimsical nature of Ethan Orner's syndicated comic strip on which it is loosely based. Ethan is the twentysomething gay everyman, always stumbling into new relationships that he quickly abandons because he feels something is missing.  His living situation is also up in the air, as his lesbian roommate and he have to find a new place, since Leo (his ex-boyfriend) is selling the house, which he owns.  His mother (played by Meridith Bazter) is a gay wedding planner, who lives with another one of Ethan's ex-boyfriends.  Most of his friends all joke about his bad luck with men.  Then there are the ""Hat Sisters"" ... two older gay men (Veteran character actors Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle, in scene steeling roles)who dress in drag and carry out daring political activism.

When we join Ethan, he meets a hunky baseball player, Diego, who he has a whirlwind romance with ... for a while.  Looking at an old video when he moved into their current house, Ethan rekindles a spark with Leo, and tries to win him back, but finds that he is planning a commitment ceremony with someone else.  Ethan gets sidetracked into a casual relationship with a 19 year old twink real estate agent, who helps him hatch a plot to delay the sale of the house.  The film is generally an amusing, heartfelt piece, with the exception of some forced slapstick scenes that just don't work.  Daniel Letterle (""Camp"") is great in the title role.

DVD extras include alternate opening scene (which features Reichen, Lance Bass' new boyfriend), director commentary and a brief featurette about the original cartoon strip.  Originally produced for Here! TV, and rated R (simulated sex scenes, but no nudity).",1160697600,4,1817,4.88599348534202
2633834,4,B000HC2M16,"The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green brings to life Eric Ormer's long-running comic strip of the same name.  Although it took a lot of choices to create an eighty-eight minute movie out of sixteen years of comic strips, the result does capture the social whirl, the promise, and the despair of Ethan Green's life.

Ethan Green (Daniel Letterle) is a 26-year old gay man who has joined with lesbian Charlotte (Shanola Hampton) to rent a house from Ethan's old heart-throb Leo (David Monahan).  Ethan has just started a fling with a married, just-out-of-the-closet baseball player, Kyle (Diego Sorrano).  When Leo decides to sell the house, Ethan gets a suggestion from cute 19-year old Punch (Dean Shelton) to use the services of depressed Sunny Deal (Rebecca Lowman) to delay any sale.  Ethan and others get advice from Ethan's mom (Meredith Baxter) and the two Hat Sisters (Richard Riehle and Joel Brooks).  Meanwhile Leo may have developed an interest in a Log Cabin Republican, and Kyle may like Jason Chang.  Ethan's tendency to push people away if they get too close sets yo-yo relationships into action.  It all resolves happily enough, although Ethan has the opportunity to spoil things enough to generate a sequel.

Since this is a lower-budget production, there was little opportunity to illustrate the science-fiction sorts of themes that were in the strip.  To offset this, Eric Ormer was able to create an animated cartoon sequence illuminating one character.

The acting was pretty good overall.  I thought the Hat Sisters and Ethan's mother were exactly as they were in the comics.  Ethan here is nicer and more passive than in the comics.  He is cruised but doesn't cruise, he can resist having sex even when his angel allows it, and he relies on advice to initiate action.  In the strip, Ethan is frequently depressed or hostile; in the film Ethan slows down some to consider matters but doesn't get into a funk, other than one scene with Charlotte where he repeatedly calls his own behavior self-destructive.  The movie is happy with a dash of farce.  It's not a problem or unprecedented, just a choice.

Skin shots are plentiful.  Ethan has the most, but Kyle, Punch, Leo, and Juarez (Ramon de Ocampo), an ex of Ethan living with his mother, get to show off too.

The extras are a commentary track by the director, screenwriter, and executive producer, an alternative opening scene with optional commentary, the trailer, a short featurette by Eric Orner giving the history of the comic strip, and some other trailers.  You might check out Orner's Ethan Green comic books in the book section too.

The film is able to link many of the traditional brief strips together into a coherent story arc.  Fans of the comic strip need not hesitate.  People not familiar with the strip will not be disadvantaged.  Go for it.",1160352000,40,2843,4.88517745302714
