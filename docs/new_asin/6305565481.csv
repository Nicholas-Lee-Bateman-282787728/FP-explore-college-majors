Frieza shattered his armor, which it wasn't really his real transformation, but now I realized that Frieza's transformation WAS real! Look! His tail, his bull horns, his arms, his legs, his
body, his face (his head almost looked similar to his father's), and EVERYTHING'S huge!!!!!!!!! Frieza did gore Krillin by spearing through his stomach with one of his horns (OUCH!). Gohan got mad, and man, was he shootin'! I never thought that this episode would NEVER end! Krillin survived, and he sliced off his tail with a lot of Destructo-Disks! (There's a reason
they did it the anime way!) Then, it was Piccolo VS. Frieza. Frieza didn't transform in his third form yet. This video only
had Episodes 64, 65 and 66 (get me the box set of those Frieza Saga Videos if you know what I mean). The 67th episode is where Frieza changes into his third form (see Frieza-Revealed). Boy, Piccolo and Frieza were doing good fighting stunts on each other!",1020038400,,1004,4.7102272727272725

Also always get uncut if you can afford it sure it's way goryer and  the language can get roughf but cut has stuff cut out .  I was waching a  tape that was cut and all the sudden one of freizas henchman falls down  dead and you son't even know how he died.
If you want a good freiza tape  get the new trunks tapes thats cool (he turns super saiyin) And while your  at it pick up some brand new andriod tapes with three super sayins  vegeta,goku, and trunks.",965692800,,678,4.030075187969925
7891371,5,6305565481,"Oh WOW!  This is my favorite Frieza volume. I was sooo shocked since I saw the edited ep's first when I saw the gory Krillan and Frieza  scene.  It made my heart stop with how sad and terrified poor little Krillan was,  and still it amazed me how I keep on loving how cocky and mean Frieza is.  I can say I've heard how some of the subbed voices sounded, and I  personally love the english ones better, and hey, I think King Kai sounded  okay in both versions, but I'm not that picky until it comes to taking out  parts they did in this volume!  This is definantly one to get, since they  practically cut out a whole entire episode!  It's worth every penny, and  you people out there who watch the dub and complain about it, find  something better to do, and stop flaming out good voice actors, K?  Hope  this is a good review, I can say I love this video, and every Frieza volume  I have and have seen so far.  It's uncut sub fans, so what's all the  complaining about?  Chaio!",961286400,2,978,4.161290322580645
