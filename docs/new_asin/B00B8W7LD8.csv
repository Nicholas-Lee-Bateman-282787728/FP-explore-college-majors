5563379,1,B00B8W7LD8,"I wonder how others can call this tripe ""brilliant"" or ""exciting"" as it is neither one. What we have is a long, drawn-out bit of pomposity by Fry wondering why he likes Wagner's music even tho he's Jewish. Get over it Stephen! Wagner's genius transcends any labels. Prior to 1945, many of the greatest Wagnerian singers and conductors were Jewish because they honored and were inspired by the music, not the failings of the man. Wagner even chose Hermann Levi, who was Jewish, to conduct his last and greatest opera, ""Parsifal"", so he may have written anti-Semitic junk but didn't put it into practice. After all, Leonard Bernstein was one of the finest Wagner conductors in the post-war era. Some people are simple-minded enough to equate Wagner with the Nazis. Wagner was dead for 50 years before Hitler came to power so he had nothing to do with their use of his music. Had Hitler loved Beethoven or Bach, would those be labeled today as well?

I've enjoyed Fry's comedy in the past but of late he's taken himself far too seriously. Don't waste your time on this. Give it up Stephen and just enjoy the greatness of Wagner's music.",1375142400,6,1133,4.665
5563380,5,B00B8W7LD8,"Stephen Fry is one of the funniest men on earth, a man possessed of great acting talent. Think of the hysterical TV series A Bit of Fry and Laurie, 26 episodes co-starring Hugh Laurie revered as great comic genius to his awarding-winning portrayal of Oscar Wilde, his talent is enormous and somewhat audacious.
Richard Wagner was an incredibly abstruse German composer, author of many operas and especially well known for his series of creations collectively called Te Ring, four operas based of Germany's most popular myths. Wagner was Adolph Hitler's favorite composer. Fry is Jewish, and just old enough to recall the results of the Second World War.
So, why in the name of heaven would he do a motion picture entitled Wagner & Me (First Run Features)? Wagner was Adolph Hitler's very favorite composer, representing to him both the best of the Master Race and a faux history and prophecy of the Third Reich. How could an Englishman, who is Jewish, possibly reconcile Wagner's music with history and reality?
Fry explores the beauty and complexities of the opera Parsifal and the four pieces composing the ring: Das Rheingold, Die Walkure, Siegfried and Gotterdammerung. Visually stunning, Fry traces Wagner's life, both personal and creative. The audience is treated to a tour of Europe and the composer's search for fame, fortune, recognition, and, frequently, his next meal, in 18h century Europe. Late in life, a gay flirtation with the mad King Ludwig, with Wagner counterfeiting similar feelings, led to final financial stability and the building of a special theatre in Bayreuth just for Wagner's mammoth productions. The four operas of The Ring are sumptuously performed there yearly, and for decades it has literally been the hottest ticket in the world, impossibly expensive even if you're lucky enough to be offered one. The waiting list for subscriptions, said to be a highly guarded secret, is reportedly enormous. Drawing untold thousands of fans every year, there is a demand for over a half a million tickets for a supply of on 58, 000. The waiting list is between five and ten years, at least, with somewhat Draconian rules and regs just for the applications.
Fry was able to obtain tickets to all four operas. But how to reconcile the obvious and complex problem here? With humor, charm, pain, soul-searching, and an infinity of questions, Fry attains the obvious answer. Hitler is arguably the most evil man of the last century, the destruction, pain and suffering he caused can never be understood. Fry, with a great deal of help, realizes that we must not let this monster's action stain the beauty of the composer's genius. It is impossible to deny Der Fuhrer's affection for the music, and it is impossible to overlook the composer's anti-Semitism. Yet one must force oneself, however difficult, to have the strength to look beyond the hatred and see, and most of all, feel, the beauty of the music. Fry suggests that while any sort of forgiveness may be out of the question, one must be able to step beyond the sordid history and appreciate the genius that created this beauty. This DVD follows Fry's search for a reconciliation, and is instructive, inspiring, and quite simply an incredible journey.",1372550400,9,3227,4.98886827458256
5563381,5,B00B8W7LD8,"Mr. Fry's sincere, almost giddy enthusiasm, is contagious.  For him to share his joy at this Master's brilliance  is remarkable and uncommon.  Anyone who appreciates Wagner's work should see this film.",1371945600,5,201,5.419354838709677
5563382,4,B00B8W7LD8,"I first discovered British TV actor/commentator Stephen Fry a few years ago via the DVD titled ""Stephen Fry's America"" where he traveled through nearly all 50 states giving us an ""outsider""' s view of our country. (I still recommend that title.). This 89 minute show co-produced by the BBC and released in Europe last year (now making it's NTSC debut) follows Fry on his first visit to the city of Bayreuth, Germany to attend the annual Bayreuth Festival of Wagnerian Operas which is presented in the theater that Wagner himself built (with land and money from ""Mad"" King Ludwig II) in 1876. We learn a few things early on in the program:
1) Wagner is Fry's hero
2) Fry can play piano - not great, but he can play
3) Wagner was a favorite of Adolph Hitler
4) Fry is Jewish (and some of his relatives died in the holocaust
5) Fry has an inner conflict as to whether he should actually attend the festival
These facts weave themselves through the program as Fry and his crew travel to German, Switzerland (where Wagner lives for a while) and St. Petersburg Russia - where we see the theaters where Wagner's opera were performed.
While I'm not an opera fan - and honestly have never seen a Wagner opera - I did learn a lot about him in program. I also heard a lot about Fry's own complexes which - at times - got a bit annoying. (Speaking of annoyances, he is granted an interview with Wagner's great-granddaughter, Eva, and she provides answers to his question. But Fry won't let her go. She finally thanks him and leaves annoyed and he just winks at the camera.)
So, no, this isn't my favorite Fry show but there is enough history here - and behind-the-scenes footage here to recommend this to both opera fans and the person who wants a ""cliff notes"" lesson in Wagner's life and legacy.
There are no special features on the DVD.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5563384,5,B00B8W7LD8,"Everybody who love the music of Richard Wagner and maybe even has the chance to go to Bayreuth
should see this wonderful film.
Very good approach to the problem, that Wagner was an anti-Semite but also a great composer and to the fact, that the Wagner family had contact with Hitler even before he won the election.
Fry, who is absolutely exited about Wagners music ask himself (and other)  questions to find out, whether he can allow himself to love the music under these circumstances.

The film has strong statements but is always carried by the joy, Fry has listening to the music , being in contact with the artists.

very recommendable .",1344124800,13,643,4.672566371681416
5563385,3,B00B8W7LD8,"I have to be the first to admit, if you do not like the humour of Stephen Fry you have no chance of enjoying this movie. Intriguing, Fry a manic depressive chooses such a dark composer as Wagner to steer his inner passions. Within the unconscious minds of many, the link between between the Nazi stormtroopers marching to the music of Wagner is primal and never to be expunged from the mind. In view of this and the Jewish heritage of Fry creates a drive to sit through the movie. Fry travels to Bayreuth in Germany to the annual Wagner festival and with his hallmark style and intellect walks the viewer through his passion for the music yet dread of the composer being linked directly to the rise of Hitler. The movie highlights interesting interviews with the relative of Wagner who is also no less, director of the music festival. The most poignant moment goes to the interview with a Holocaust victim, a cellist who played in Auschwitz. Fry pleads for her view on his love of Wagner the composer. He seeks either redemption from her or justification all is fine and forgiven. These precious interview moments serve to remind Fry and the audience of the fight to live taking place in the concentration camp. For other viewers, the movie feels operatic with Fry taking his seat at the Wagner festival wrestling with  his inner self to decide if he should stay or leave before watching an entire production. An intriguing movie with some decidedly Fry moments provides enough freedom for the viewer to determine if the dark side of Wagner wins Fry over or quiet simply the opportunity really does exist to separate the genius of the composer from his bleak heritage. Just as Fry you will wrestle with this dilemma well after sitting through the movie.",1303430400,14,1753,4.691558441558442

8564270,1,B00B8W7LD8,"Beautiful castle? Could be, but all we get to see is Fry looking at it. Great theater? Could be, but all we get to see is Fry looking at it. Original manuscript of Gtterdmmerung? Could be, but all we get to see is Fry looking at it. He interviews experts, lets them say three words, and then paraphrases what they haven't had a chance to say. Every frame, no matter how beautiful the vista or the building, features Fry Fry Fry. Look at the picture: Fry in the foreground, Wagner way in the back. The movie is mistitled Wagner and Me. Is should be entitled Me Me Me Me Me Me Me and, uh, Wagner.

As for Wagners anti-Semitism, the subject was beaten to death a long time ago. A friend of mine many years ago, a Buchenwald survivor, adored Wagners music. Did he associate it with the Nazis? Not at all, any more than he associated Bach with them, though Bach was also a German, and there is far more anti-Semitism in the St John Passion than in all of Wagners operas combined. Maybe it should also be mentioned that Hitler wasn't a German, he was an Austrian, and he loved Die Fledermaus, never missed a peformance, so maybe we should blame Johann Strauss for Auschwitz. . . .  utter, pretentious nonsense.",1448841600,2,1204,4.394618834080718

8564273,2,B00B8W7LD8,"Fry is obviously obsessed with Wagner's music.  Welcome to the club.  You, I and about 10 million others who recognize Wagner as THE genius of the Romantic era and by far the world's most important operatic composer.

But then he feels guilty about his obsession.  He goes to Nueremberg to do what - celebrate the venue of what H. L. Mencken called the greatest achievement in ALL art - ""Die Meistersinger von Nueremberg""?  No, he mulls over the 1945 Nueremberg trials of Nazi criminals, and manages, as many fatuously do, to associate a man who died in 1883 with a monster who was born in 1889.  He interviews a woman who tries to talk him out of going to Bayreuth, then does so anyway and feels assuaged when he finds out that Regietheater has transmogrified Wagner's works into unrecognizable, often polemicized absurdity.

Still, he rides into the sunset as in any good Western and encourages us all to enjoy Wagner's genius.  Good luck with that.  I'd say stay away from live operatic performances altogether and get the still available authentically produced DVD's of Wagner's operas, most of them by the Met.",1408838400,2,1115,4.795811518324608
8564274,5,B00B8W7LD8,"If you are a Frye & Laurie fan and/or have loved Stephen Fry in all his many hats (from drama to comedy), this is a must of a documentary.  Fry openly discusses his Jewish heritage on his mother's side and his mixed feelings over loving Wagner's music.  This is not a sad monologue; Fry brings movement, history, musicians, and conductors into his musings as he journeys to the Bayreuth Festival.  Oh yes, this fine film is also a must for Wagner fans of every age.",1406332800,2,465,4.447058823529412
8564275,4,B00B8W7LD8,"Stephen Fry is a much-beloved wit, storyteller, presenter, writer and actor. Hes also fanatically in love with the music of Richard Wagner.

So what? Lots of people love Wagners music. Some would say there is nothing grander. Adolf Hitler wouldve concurred.

And that, more or less, is the premise of WAGNER & ME.

Although it is an interesting premise it is far less dramatically impacting than the creators of this film would hope. For one thing, Wagner was long dead when Hitler came along. True, they are ideologically connected in that Wagner was a pronounced anti-Semite, but so was half of Europe. What Hitler saw in Wagners music was an artistic symbol of Nazi ideology, but Wagner had nothing to do with it. To suggest that Wagners music is inextricably linked with Hitler and National Socialism is like equating the music of The Beatles with Charles Manson and his family. Its more a question of what a sick mind can do to exploit something already powerful and meaningful by layering onto it a perverted agenda (albeit, in Wagners case, with the blessing of his family).

And that, perhaps, is arguably a story of much greater resonance and interest. Problem is, the story of Wagners familys relationship with Hitler has already been captivatingly told in Tony Palmers far more weighty study The Wagner Family, a film deemed so damning by the Wagner family that they have attempted to launch a law suit against Mr. Palmer (to no avail, it seems).

Further, any dramatic potential in exploring Frys guilt (he is Jewish) at finding so much enjoyment in Wagners music is quickly neutralized by observing his boyish sense of wonder at being in Bayreuth (the home of the Wagner Festival) and taking part in behind the scenes exercises like watching rehearsals, observing costume fittings (the Valkyries are more fun without Tom Cruise) and discussing Wagners considerable contribution to music with various musicians. The film is unfocused in its intent in this way. For anyone who loves (at least some of) Wagners music (as I do) can separate the music itself from the claims of Nazism and even the sympathies of Wagners widow and children.

Remember the play and subsequent film of Amadeus, which showed Mozart to be a braying little brat who, despite his moral failings (much to rival Antonio Salieris chagrin) was a musical genius of unparalleled achievement? The premise is more or less the same, if one can accept, for arguments sake, the comparison of a propensity for telling dirty jokes to fanning the insidious flames of racism.

In the end, its the music that counts, which is the conclusion reached in WAGNER & ME. Were anyone inclined to feel guilty over their spine-tingling reaction to the opening chords of Tristan & Isolde for example, there is no need, we are assured. If Stephen Fry can separate the two, so can we. Where the film is maybe a tad anti-climactic is the assertion that we require Stephen Fry to tell us that.

Dont get me wrong, Mr. Fry is an impeccable, fun and good-natured host. A true gentleman, Im inclined to politely listen to what he expounds, on the subject of Wagner, at least.

Ultimately, it is Wagners glorious music  performed on the ultimate Wagner stage (actually, under it)  that really boosted my appreciation for the film. Definitely worth seeing, but not as revelatory as intended, WAGNER & ME is perhaps more of an indulgence than a thought-provoking essay. But it has the virtue of being fun, and how often can you that about Wagner?",1397433600,10,3494,4.855462184873949

8564277,3,B00B8W7LD8,"I like Wagner's music. But...I could hardly hear Fry talking sometimes because the music was SO LOUD! No subtitles so I never knew what he said. That is why I gave it a 3-star. I loved Fry's excitement with the music. It is nice to see somebody so affected by music. This guy is really into it. Passionate and cute. Thought it touching that he could not walk up to the lectern (or whatever it is called at the top) at Nuremberg. The visits to opera houses and the development of the stage is very interesting. I walked away from this film learning more about Wagner and his music. I wish there would have been some mention about Wagner's association with Nietzsche. Both of these men suffered from an undeserved association with Hitler. This film is worth watching not only for Wagner but for Fry's excitement and struggle with this music. If it wasn't for the barely audible speech, at times, I would have given it a 5-start.",1382227200,,926,4.517857142857143
