7805215,3,6300166732,"This is NOT a movie. It's a one-hour episode from the 1970s British TV series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thriller/dp/B003TIQJQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thriller</a>. Pamela Franklin plays a woman who's been raped, and now sees the rapist everywhere. Is it him -- or is ""he"" all in her mind?

If you want to buy this series, do NOT confuse it for the 1960s American TV series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thriller/dp/B003NOGNQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thriller</a>, the one starring Boris Karloff. Not the same series.

Also, do NOT buy the American DVD release of this series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thriller-The-Complete-Season-One/dp/B000A0GXN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thriller - The Complete Season One</a>. The American release only contains Season One, which does not have this episode, ""Screamer.""

You want the British DVD release --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thriller/dp/B003TIQJQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thriller</a>&nbsp;-- which contains ALL the seasons. However, the British release is PAL only, so you'll need a region-free DVD player.

If you think the British release is expensive, you might find a better price on Amazon's British site -- Amazon.co.uk. That's where I bought the British DVDs from, and it was priced better at the time. I've often bought British DVDs from Amazon's British site. It's not a hassle. You can use your regular Amazon account. Just be aware that the pound is currently worth more than the dollar. You'll be charged the dollar equivalent, and your credit card company might add a small currency conversion fee.

As for the series itself -- it's an anthology series. Different actors every episode. Most of the episodes are crime/suspense stories. A few spy stories. And a few more supernatural horror stories. I like the supernatural horror stories best.

The series was shot on video, not film, and so it has that 1970s video ""look."" Not as soft as video came to be by the 1990s, when the ""film look"" process was developed.

The series has many actors who were famous in the 1970s. Although it's a British series, most episodes have a prominent American actor. This is because the series was co-funded by an American network (ABC, I think), and they insisted that some actors be known to American audiences. So you have Barbara Feldman (Agent 99 from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Smart/dp/B001E0O8DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Smart</a>&nbsp;in one episode. Donna Mills (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knots-Landing/dp/B000CS45AG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knots Landing</a>) stars in a few.

It's an okay series, though I wish it had concentrated more on horror than on crime/suspense stories.",1423612800,2,2941,6.640625
