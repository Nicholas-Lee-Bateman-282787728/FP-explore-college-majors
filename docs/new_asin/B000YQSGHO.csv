3035124,2,B000YQSGHO,"I have watched many of Cesar Millan's shows, and videos.  This particular video seemed repetative and a waste of money for me.  If you're a greenhorn to the Dog Whisperer, then this video may be helpful to you.",1403395200,,210,4.5
3035125,5,B000YQSGHO,"I've had dogs my whole life and I wish I had this video years ago.  There is so much great information in this relatively short video.  NOTE:  you need to watch this BEFORE you go to pick out your new companion.  (we also got ""Cesar Millan's Short guide to a Happy Dog...""  which I also highly recommend for continuing education for the owner and the dog.
His method is simple, straightforward and gets results.  We just got a 10 month old dog from a rescue organization and have apply the methods taught here.  We've had Annie for two weeks now and she walks very well on a lease most of the time, and is respectful of us and our belongings  As a bonus, I've been getting a lot more exercise which I needed.
Our last dog was so spoiled that we couldn't hardly take her anywhere and she was constantly begging for food and barking.
If things continue the way they have been going, Annie will be able to go everywhere we go and she already sits next to us without begging while we eat.  I am so happy we decided to follow Cesar's advice this time.",1358985600,,1046,4.269035532994923
3035126,5,B000YQSGHO,I bought this DVD for my daughter to help her find the right dog for her family. It was an excellent resource and she found just the perfect at our local shelter. Thanks Cesar,1351987200,,175,4.176470588235294
3035127,5,B000YQSGHO,"I am about to rescue a dog for a family pet and I found this video incredibly helpful.  I have a much better idea of what to look for in a dog for my family, other than just ""cute"".  I also learned how to meet a dog, how to introduce him to my children and how to bring him into my home for the first time.  I also showed it to my children to prepare them to meet our new pet. I shared some of what I had learned with my long-time-dog-owning friend and most of it was completely new information to her.  I feel much better prepared to make the experience a positive one for my family and our new pet.",1318636800,,600,3.8934426229508197
3035128,5,B000YQSGHO,"If you are considering getting a dog, this is the video for you! This is for people who want to get a dog, not so much a puppy. He does use younger dogs as examples, but they are not the focus. This video gives information that is not always in the show. He goes into greater detail than he does in the show. It was very informational and still entertaining. I reccomend this to people who have not chosen their dog yet or brought him/her into the home. Also, it is good for people who are getting a new dog and adding him/her to their family that already has dogs.",1311033600,,565,4.1454545454545455
3035129,1,B000YQSGHO,The DVD mainly focuses on choosing a puppy and the first days.  It doesn't give you training information for a puppy on a long term basis.,1303171200,,138,4.3076923076923075
3035130,5,B000YQSGHO,"Excellent in all ways... I just got an eight week old female Golden and
had watched this video... and read some of Cesar's books.  It really
makes alot of sense that you need to relate with your dog and understand
and take the TIME to know your dog.

3035131,5,B000YQSGHO,"I just wish it would touch on puppies too.  Now it only talks about bringing in an adult dog.

I think it's very helpful and I wish people would study this before getting a dog.  In fact, I think shelters and rescue groups etc should make people watch this video before proceeding to choosing the dog for adoption.  After I finished watching, I already donated it to a shelter ran by my friend.  I may have to buy myself another copy when I'm ready to get another dog.",1232409600,,468,4.2727272727272725
3035132,4,B000YQSGHO,"I thought the title explained the contents very well.  It did have a section on the German Shepherd Pups which contains a great deal of information. His subject is always dog psychology, not dog training.  And puppies are young dogs and show a lot of the dog behavior of the older ones.  And they respond much the same way.  No harsh or impatient training tactics of course -- but the same should be said of older dogs, too.

A tremendous book about puppies is by the Monks of New Skete. (They were also a strong influence on Cesar.)

I always learn a lot from Cesar's DVDs and even more as I watch them again.",1223251200,,610,4.307017543859649
3035133,1,B000YQSGHO,I am a major fan of Cesar and expected way more information than I got.  I thought this video was suppossed to tell you about what to do from day one and it tells you practically nothing if you have a puppy.  Only thing its good for are a few tips if you go to a shelter.

3035134,5,B000YQSGHO,"I  wish more people could see this video before bringing a dog home, be it a puppy or dog.

The need for rescues, shelter and breeders to see this video would be so good as they would see the need to be good pack leaders to have balanced dogs and puppies and to match the energy of the puppy or dog with the future owners.

For these purposes, this DVD provided a lot of great insights and information that I didn't pick up from the show (I have seen more than 75% of all his shows thus far).  It follows 3 families that adopt a new pet from a shelter, from a rescue, and from a breeder.

I purchased vol. 1, 2 and 3 and have read that these DVDs are not worth the money.  I have only seen #3 thus far because of my current predicament, and I say that it was worth every penny.  It is almost like a hand-holding guide to bringing in a new dog to your home which is what I liked most about it.  I am confident now that I will find the right dog to adopt and know what energy to bring to the adoption places.

On the negative side, the puppy section was way too short and the ""beyond"" part of the title is only in the theory, that all the activities that establish leadership on the first day will carry on to the rest of their lives (he only shows the first day activities).
