What is really amazing is the price when compared to other children DVDs.",1459296000,,182,4.382352941176471
8173482,5,B000MX7TWM,It is unfortunate that another reviewer has given this product a one-star review based on the product not arriving. That has nothing to do with the quality of the product. This is an excellent DVD. My 4 year-old daughter loves it and can now sing the songs. I purchased a copy after borrowing it from the library. I could not recommend it more highly.,1329004800,,351,4.5
8173483,5,B000MX7TWM,"My 2 year old daughter loves this dvd and the cd. She begs to watch the dvd at home and now knows most of the hand motions that the kids do to each song. In the car she asks to listen to ""Bible songs"" and loves each of the songs. She even asks me to sing them at night.",1316563200,,269,3.5762711864406778
