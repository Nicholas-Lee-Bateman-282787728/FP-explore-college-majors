8313741,5,B001JTTJAS,"I'm so happy that I finally have this in my possession!!! I now have all the DVDs of the anime!!!  It arrived today, which surprised me greatly since the tracking info on here is still saying it's on it's way.  It's in great condition, I love how it arrived speedily and without any problems.  I'm beyond ecstatic at this DVD arriving.  Great vendor, awesome anime!!!

The episodes on this DVD did throw me for a loop as it neared towards the end of the series.  It was a perfect ending in my opinion.  It also reminded me why I fell in love with the anime to begin with years ago.  I recommend this to anyone if they're looking for a good anime to watch.  It doesn't leave any room for doubt or disappointment.",1440892800,,711,4.285714285714286

I loved Mikami and Light and their (small) interactions, and this final set of episodes was great. I adored Brad Swaile's psycho laugh in the last episode. The death of my favorite character disappointed me. I liked Near, I really did, but...not in the last episode. His creepy, creepy smile was disturbing. Near and Light's faceoff was a let down. It should have ended like the manga did, with Ryuk finally getting his due. I liked Matsuda's revenge, but the manga made it so much more of a karmic death. It would, like the manga, have been better and left a sequel open if it had ended with Kira's victory.",1344729600,,629,4.616071428571429
8313743,5,B001JTTJAS,"I've always loved Death Note, it's been one my top favorite anime shows for about 4 years now. And Death Note vol. 9 contains the very last episodes ever. It can be pretty exciting and suspenseful on what's going to happen next, or what crazy turn it could take. But my opinion on the last episode is a little different, because it had a huge blood trail, and I've seen that too many times in anime shows. I wish they would have kept the ending like it was in the books, since it didn't leave that much of a blood trail. Instead, he just looked like a pathetic child in front of everyone. But other than that, I think the 9th volume is great, especially since it completes your Death Note series collection.",1281312000,,707,4.323308270676692
8313744,2,B001JTTJAS,"While Death Note is one of the most amazing stories the suspense and war between Mello, Near and Kira reach an impresive climax I must say I was quite dissapointed by the end of what happened to be an excellent series... I'd love to see the alternate endings made in Japan which unfortunately none of them were finished.",1273968000,,320,4.5344827586206895
8313745,5,B001JTTJAS,"Death Note, Volume #9 is a terrific climax to an awesome Anime series. Death Note itself is an incredibly well written Anime based on its Manga counterpart. Volume #9 sees Near and Mello battling over who will capture Kira. Near suspects that Kira is actually Light Yagami and a 3 way war insues. Kira enlists the help of 2 of his followers (featured on the cover). And the cat-and-mouse psyche game, which was formerly between Light and L, resumes. And this time, there are some creepy twists.

Enjoy the climax to this awesome Anime!
