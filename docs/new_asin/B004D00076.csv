8424458,1,B004D00076,"This movie was absolutely THE WORST !  Even if you watched this movie when it first came out, it SUCKED !  Pathetic acting...horrible script !  Obviously, the movie took pot-shots at Timothy Leary - who was himself, a total phony baloney !  Scenes around Golden Gate Park were about the best thing about this movie...the rest was a ""Made for Children"" dramatic flop which tried to tell kiddies not to play around with the white sugar cubes that the Jefferson Airplane made famous - - filled with LSD !",1413331200,2,501,4.595505617977528

8424460,4,B004D00076,The Love-Ins is a good movie all around. There was a lot of substance to the plot and the scenes from days past was nice to watch. Revisiting Alice in Wonderland was a trip in itself,1374278400,4,182,4.083333333333333
8424461,5,B004D00076,"I'm sure glad that this movie is finally on DVD.Back when I was a kid at drive-in theater,it was the third movie on a triple feature and watching the two movies just wore me down and I feel asleep during 1967 movie not because it was boring but because I was tired so I never saw the end of it which was a mystery for the past 40 years until I bought this DVD recently. Anyway, It was fun to watch and to me anyway it should be a psychedelic cult classic from 1967 ""The Summer of Love"".",1346630400,6,486,3.9693877551020407
