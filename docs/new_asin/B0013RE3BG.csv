8252707,2,B0013RE3BG,"My first introduction to Lomi Lomi was in 2004 when I attended a workshop for continuing education. I was thrilled and fascinated with this modality and since then it has been my favorite. What makes it so unique is the blend of extensive use of forearm strokes which makes it both gentle and very deep and also the spirituality involved in it. Since I'm the only practitioner in my area, I hoped a video would inspire me and help add new elements to my repertoire of moves.

This DVD did neither.

There is a very brief introduction that I found lacking in many ways. I'm glad I was familiar with this already as the instructors didn't provide much general information on this style and how it is different from other forms of massage. The history of lomi lomi, how it is integrated with the other healing traditions in Hawaii and the connection to the Spirit of Aloha are paramount but barely mentioned in these few minutes of foreword.

Next we see a draped client on a table and one of the teachers - Julie - demonstrating with Tamara's voiceover. What struck me (and it continued throughout the video) is the speed of action. I kid you not, I checked several times if I hadn't pressed the fast forward button by mistake. That was not the case! We are told how we do long, ""soothing"" strokes but this fast pace is energizing, not soothing! I had the constant feeling the massage was being rushed. I can accept some clients like more vigorous work but this is an instructional video. I prefer seeing a move three times and seeing it well, rather than view it nine times and still wonder what the practitioner's hands are doing.

I was also fairly unimpressed because:

-- Nothing is mentioned about the height of the table or the best draping, or the best oils to use.
-- Nothing on body mechanics. I was very hopeful this issue would be addressed in length as I do experience lower back pain after some particularly complicated forearm strokes.
-- Very little flow in general. Lomi Lomi is supposed to feel like many hands working on you at the same time and the routine shown didn't produce this effect at all.
-- DVD is expensive but it looks as if they invited the crew in a living room, crammed everyone in a corner close to the porch and played a CD.
I didn't see many of the famous forearm strokes. I'm ready to accept it's the way they do it as styles differ in Hawaii but to me it looked like a watered down Swedish massage done in threes.
-- I wish they paid more attention to the spiritual aspect. Every once in a while they would say something like ""filled with unconditional love for the receiver, lomi lomi the back..."" which I found to be quite dry or matter-of-factly, rather than inspiring.
-- No abdominal massage at all.
-- Tamara's voiceover was very even and quite dull.

The few things I liked:
-- They bend the leg in the knee when they do the front which allows for some great work on the inner thigh. I found this to be quite interesting
-- Face massage sequence is great.

One thing they are right about: some modalities of massage can't be taught well by means of videos. Still, what they did was tape Julie massaging a client/model and Tamara dubbing/reading the script. They could have done much better than that, especially given the cost of the DVD. I must admit I have not watched Level 2 and 3 but given how dissapointed I am with Level 1, I don't plan to spend more sources on them.

The DVD might be useful to someone who's been to their workshop and practises very rarely, so they need a cheatsheet. For anyone new to Lomi Lomi, attend a workshop first or if unable to do so, try Carrie Rowell's DVDs. They are very well-made and informative - I totally recommend them.",1233705600,11,3708,4.458702064896755
