8599326,4,B00DYZ80R8,"This video is perfect for my prenatal exercises. Gentle stretching, good examples. I appreciated that Shiva offered options AND examples of what each posture should look like in each trimester, and her gentle advice to only do what is comfortable. For an advanced yoga practitioner, it may be a little slow - however, after three pregnancies, you learn that slow is a good thing, as it gives you time to evaluate how easily you can do each posture. (There is a hormones called ""relaxin"" that can make it easier to overextend during pregnancy.)
Great video. Highly recommended.",1477267200,3,576,4.948453608247423

I absolutely love doing this ""class"" every morning. I love Shiva and the calm she brings to her audience. I would highly recommend this DVD for any mother wanting to stay in shape, keep calm and also stretch and strengthen your muscles while pregnant. So thankful my husband bought this for me!",1434412800,,318,4.696428571428571
8599329,2,B00DYZ80R8,"This is a review of Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga, which is the first of two discs in this set (the other is Postnatal Yoga).

My biggest complaint is that this program is simply just boring. I consider myself an intermediate level yoga practitioner - I've done it for years and am comfortable with most poses, but my goal is to feel refreshed and energized at the end, not to push myself so hard that I feel like I'm doing cardio. I don't need to win any strength or flexibility contests, I just like opening up and feeling engaged with my body and my breath.

That said, this class presented no challenge at all. The pace is so slow, the poses so basic, and the narration so monotonous that I found my mind wandering constantly (mostly wondering when the program would end). Sure, there were a few poses where I could feel myself stretching out, but I consider that a bare minimum for any yoga practice. If you don't feel a stretch at all, you're just sitting still.

A couple specific critiques:

1. This set bills itself as ""specially designed workouts for 1st trimester, 2nd trimester, 3rd trimester, and after baby"" which is misleading since the first three ""workouts"" are just the same class with modifications shown for each trimester. Considering how easy the 1st trimester version was, I can only imagine how little effort the 2nd and 3rd trimester versions require.

2. The class is 50 minutes divided into five sections - an introduction, warm up, standing poses, mat poses, and relaxation - and although they say you can limit yourself to only one or two sections of the class at a time, there is no way to navigate just to the section you want without just fast forwarding. Also the introduction is long-winded and unnecessary, it sounds more like a statement intended to limit the program's liability than true instruction or inspiration.

3. The majority of the standing poses require a chair even if you're in the 1st trimester. I found this cumbersome to deal with and tried to do a few of the poses in the traditional way, but some just seemed to be made up in order to use the chair so the 2nd and 3rd trimester ladies (who had to show modifications using the chair) didn't feel left out.

4. The poses throughout each section end up feeling incredibly repetitive. The number of times you stretch your arm over your head to the side, or your arms above your head and back, is just silly. Ok maybe this time you're sitting and that time you're standing, but it's essentially the same pose. Whole areas of my body (my lower back, calves, abdomen, arms) got barely any attention at all, while others (hips, side waist, and quads) kept doing the same thing over and over. That does not make for a well-rounded practice, especially when you're only getting the one workout on the disc.

5. This might sound odd, but I have come to find real comfort in the some of the guidance and perspective offered by the instructors of some of my other prenatal DVDs. It makes me feel more in touch with my changing body, and connected to my baby and to other women who are experiencing the same emotions, thoughts, and challenges that I am. Shiva Rea's pregnancy commentary is perfunctory at best. It is actually unclear if she is even pregnant in the DVD, which would be fine if she was able to forge a connection to that experience simply through dialogue, but she doesn't. This class may as well be for senior citizens or extremely new beginners, as there is very little that feels specific to pregnancy.

6. Other reviews have mentioned this and I thought it sounded petty and wouldn't bother me, but the way Shiva Rea says ""exhale"" is in fact very distracting. She says ""inhale"" just fine, in-hale, but for some reason she says ""exhale"" like ex-sale, no h in the ""hale."" I can't describe how odd it is or why it's annoying but it is, especially when you're listening to it for the full 50 minutes.

I refrained from giving the program 1 star because I suppose there are women who are brand new to yoga who might find this calming and relaxing, but for anyone else, do yourself a favor and try another class. I personally love Radiant Pregnancy with Hala Khouri, but there are tons of others out there too.",1428364800,8,4209,4.570291777188329
8599330,5,B00DYZ80R8,"This workout is light, but definitely gives your body a wonderful stretch and leaves you feeling relaxed and open. I would definitely recommend this work out for those women who are pregnant.",1416268800,2,191,5.0
