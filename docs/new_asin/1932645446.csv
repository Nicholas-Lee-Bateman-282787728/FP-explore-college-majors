203122,1,1932645446,"The title of this DVD alone should be enough to tell all people to avoid this.  This is boring even for little kids.  The characters are completely out-of-character, and everything is so sugarcoated that it makes your skin crawl.  Little kids get bored when this show is on.  This is an insult to children's intelligence and a disgrace to the Looney Tunes creators.",1059696000,9,365,4.746031746031746

203131,1,1932645446,This CD was a very enjoyable and educational experience for a child.  I was very disappointed that it worked only for the first viewing and then malfunctioned and broke.  The other two CD's in the same ordered are still being enjoyed and they work fine.,1239235200,,253,4.6

203133,5,1932645446,"Have you ever wondered where your Catholic faith fits into salvation history? Why do Catholics do what they do? Where is that in the bible?  Jeff Cavins, through study of the scriptures, has completely illuminated my understanding of the Catholic faith. Jeff's knowledge of scripture and history is both entertaining and informative. His simple format makes this bible study possible for all levels of bible knowledge.  This study is a MUST HAVE for every parish.",1182384000,16,463,5.16
203134,5,1932645446,Baby Looney Tunes is a cute show that children and parents alike can't help but like.  This dvd is a great addition to any collection.,1166572800,4,134,4.36
203135,1,1932645446,"My a lot younger sister is addicted to Baby Looney tunes. So when comparing all the kid shows, this one is definitely the dumbest. Some actually have reason, and some are actually pretty good, like Thomas the train, or some of the cartoon network shows. But one, Baby Looney tunes, a slow-paced show for very young kids, ruins and disgraces, some of Chuck Jones and Bob Clapton's classic characters. It is so idiotic, I can't listen to it, which happens because my sister puts it on so loud. Granny walks like a ""hunchbutt"" Tweety sounds like a girl. The characters have no clue, and it's even on Boomerang's cartoons without a clue, and in a lot of ways. The stupid writers and directors(Warner Bros.) must've made this while sleeping. Trying to make Bugs Bunny look like a cute little bunny. Just program when he said ""What up Doc.""
Then Granny does her stupid gardening and baking like all other grannies. This is so not educational. When do Bunny's have brownies.
Definitely do not buy this.
Unless you have a child or sister like mine, who is really crazy and weird. I feel so sorry for her now.

Last but not least the music on this DVD and show. It's terrible, annoying, and is so repetitive. Every part of this show is annoying. When I was younger it was even hard for me to watch.
It stinks, it's horrible. People, this is classic cartoons at it's worst.

Tom chasing Jerry, a classic, Yosemitie Sam looking for some ole' rabbit, a classic, our first great talking cartoon, that should forever be remembered but now a little baby's cartoon of cute blissful made up cartoon character's a disgrace, and already been airing for over 15 years. Warner bros. should stop trying to attract kids, and let the greatest cartoon characters ever live on. Not make them foolish.",1153008000,,1774,4.646496815286624
203136,5,1932645446,"This is a perfect way to read and understand your bible. Jeff Cavins gives simplistic ways of presenting the hardest passages. You read, and then view the hour long session. If you just devote an hour a week you can feel fed, and satisfied that you have a better understanding of God's word. You really don't have to purchase the study book guide to keep up. We purchased this for our Parish family for a bible study, they loved it. We will continue to show it as long as we can. It is a very good investment for your family, and parish family.",1139097600,23,544,4.29126213592233
203137,5,1932645446,"People NEED to lighten up!!! My 20 month old daughter LOVES this show. It is a harmless, lovely cartoon that lights up my baby's face when it comes on. She loves her ""Tooney Tunes' as she would say.",1128902400,9,198,4.2368421052631575
203138,1,1932645446,"These cartoons are truly sickening.

Why must they spoil the greatest cartoon characters ever made and make them cute little babies? It's awful. They've destroyed every single character... from Bugs Bunny to Petunia Pig.

All the characters are annoying, but the two very worst (in my opinion) are Sylvester and Tweety. Tweety is huge. He is almost as tall as Sylvester. And for the record, Tweety is a male bird. And Sylvester is a big wimp who DOESN'T TRY TO EAT TWEETY! INSTEAD HE IS ONE OF TWEETY'S FRIENDS! I shudder even thinking about it.

The animation has absolutely no spirit. The characters are all turned 'cute' and they move slowly, with not even the slightest hint of squash and stretch.

And worst of all, the characters teach kids not to lie and it's mean to make fun of others. This is very comical, Considering all the things that they do in the original cartoons. Such as, Daffy gambling his money away, Bugs shooting a guy in the audience for coughing, Taz attempting to eat Bugs Bunny, numerous times, Sylvester telling Tweety to hide in his mouth, Granny whopping Sylvester with her umbrella and Tweety beating up a bumble bee and stuffing it in a horse costume so the two cats inside will be stung.

In all fairness, this show itself wouldn't be so bad were it not the Looney Tunes characters. It still wouldn't be good, mind you, but not terrible.

It's sad to see classic cartoons ruined like this. Watch DUCK DODGERS instead.",1124323200,2,1451,4.670588235294118
203139,5,1932645446,"Baby Looney Tunes is the best thing that has happened to tv since Jim Henson's Muppet Babies. What upsets me is that BLT only lasted one season. The Muppet Babies lasted 7. I love the movie especially when Daffy doesn't beleive that the Easter Bunny exists. The cutest BLT is Petunia Pig (Who is not featured in the movie but on a bonus episode on this DVD - ""The Magic Of Spring."" in this cartoon series, the is a new Looney Tune, Melissa. i do not remember seeing an adult Melissa. This is a must own.",1081814400,5,503,4.25
203140,4,1932645446,"I have been recording them from the TV and my 2 yr old loves them. Both my husband and I find them to be entertaining enough to watch with her, as well as teaching good lessons. (What is a time-out for? Jokes at the expense of others is mean. Telling tall tales is not the way to impress your friends ...) I could go on and on. However, I have personally found Bugs to be the most irritating of the bunch. The voice character acting leaves a lot to be desired, and grates on my nerves.
From a recent episode, it seems that the baby's are really about 4-5 years old also, so I don't know why they have them running about in diapers at different times. The same goes for eating in high chairs with bibs. The series is either very free with jumping back and forth between ages, or noone can decide what age the babies really are supposed to be.",1067817600,6,841,4.1656441717791415
