7965173,5,B0000694YJ,"Have not watched BLONDIE since 1957, when I was 6, and what a pleasure to see it again. Dagwood Bumstead to me was the TV sitcom version > a little over the top, but funny. Can't say *inspired*, which I *can* say about Burn and Allen, and it appears to this REviewer that this DVD contains the earliest episodes, yes, commercials (not just ""live"" but written into the plotline!) and all.

We have not gotten to the craziness of George getting tired of his own show and then going up to his attic to watch the rest on a small TV! Instead, he is the ""Our Town"" host, in and out of the proceedings. And it is live, live, live: a character walks in thru the front door and then *out* thru the set! And Burns never misses a beat!

90% of Gracie's jokes work 65 years later!

This is a fun package! Buy it.",1431302400,,800,4.148387096774194
7965174,4,B0000694YJ,"Especially the adventures of Blondie & Dagwood [I titled it that way!]. With Arthur Lake [who did the Blondie movie series from1938 to 1950] as ""Dagwood"" with the legendary Penny Singleton as ""Blondie"". He was back in the role, in the 1950s, in a short tv series of the same title but with Pamela Britton in the role of Blondie. And that's Florenz Ames playing Mr Dithers, his boss, who also was the bank examiner in the 1946 classic ""A Wonderful Life"" with James Stewart, Donna Reed & Lionel Barrymore as ""Mr. Potter"". The one episode you will laugh is ""Puppy Love"" of 1957. And George Burns & Gracie Allen were legendary comedians from the late 1920s to early 1950s  who made some hilarious comedies for tv in the 1950s.",1423612800,,722,4.553846153846154
7965175,1,B0000694YJ,"It would be great to see Blondie and Dagwood tv show on dvd.
The movies are on dvd with Arthur Lake and Penny Singleton.
Time to put the tv show episodes on dvd. it seems like shows I don't like or never heard of are on dvd.",1354838400,2,224,3.7872340425531914
7965176,1,B0000694YJ,"I had never seen either of these television shows, but I was a fan of George Burns' and have been fortunate enough to hear old radio broadcasts of Burns and Allen at work as a team, so I was excited to get the chance to see recordings of their show. Unfortunately, even the outlandish repartee between George Burns and Gracie Allen could not save this DVD.
There are three episodes of the Burns and Allen Show and three episodes of Blondie on the DVD. From the menu, you can select the episode of your choice, or choose to watch the episodes of one or the other show in order. There are no extra features.
Neither show was much more than an overblown commercial for evaporated milk. Seriously. Each episode might consist of 5 minutes of total talk time that did not make mention of the grand company that sponsored the show.
I forced myself through all three of the Burns and Allen shows, just because I think Gracie Allen was incredibly funny. The episodes included some solo stand-up by Burns and then he would introduce the next skit, which he would walk into at some appropriate time. Each skit apparently hade to make mention of the aforementioned sponsor and between skits guest singers performed.  The whole premise behind the first Blondie episode was so ridiculous that I couldn't even believe I would have found it entertaining in the 50s, let alone now. I was not enthralled enough to watch 2 more dramatic commercials, so I returned it without watching the rest. (Luckily, I was just renting it.)
While I know the producers of the DVD couldn't very well go back and change the commercializing aspect of the shows, the DVD might have been improved with more content. Not recommended.",1065312000,15,1694,4.665551839464883
