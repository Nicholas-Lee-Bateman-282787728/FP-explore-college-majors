8516842,5,B007HRAXHO,"For a low-budget, indie production, I thought this film was great. Atmospheric and engaging, with excellent production standards throughout (lighting, camera angles, editing, sound effects, etc., in addition to story/acting/direction).

Just the right length: an 82-minute story told in 82-minutes.

I liked the treatment of the supernatural: how inexplicable occurrences happen to rational people, leaving them with weird memories to sort out, or question. That reminded me of K-Pax.

If more people could make more things like this on a shoestring, fueled by passion, the world would be a better place.

Highly recommended.",1391212800,,625,5.688172043010753
8516843,4,B007HRAXHO,Aside from making a film frightening they did it without blood and gore. The pace of the film was good and the acting and direction was exceptional. I seen so many films on the Sci-Fi channel that just wouldn't compare to the quality of this production. I highly recommend this film.,1332547200,2,283,4.568627450980392
