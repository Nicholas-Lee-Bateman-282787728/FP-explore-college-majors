8502790,4,B006PHQY52,"Unfortunately ZED is just one of too many examples of Cirque shows which are no longer playing but for which Cirque made a conscious decision to NOT record on video. I know this because because I asked and that was the response. I treasure the DVDs I do have of earlier touring shows, and have to ""settle"" for those no longer in existence but which have snippets on YOUTUBE. I would rather have purchased a Cirque produced DVD.",1367539200,,427,4.487179487179487
8502791,5,B006PHQY52,"This is simply amazing.
Superb music. Wonderful photography. Great behind the scenes story of ZED that I really wanted to know. A rare insider's view of Cirque Du Soleil. Simply one of the best movies I've seen.",1341273600,6,211,4.72972972972973
