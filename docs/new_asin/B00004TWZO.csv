That is all I could say after seeing the conclusion of the series. The first two episodes in this tape are standard episodes which we have all come to love from the series. The last two are part of one story arc which tests his resolve and in the end let him truly choose who he loves most.
I think the thing that I love most about this set of episodes is that Kyosuke finally uses his powers somewhat frequently! There were many times when I yelled at my TV becuase Kyosuke could have made his life easier if he used his Power, though that shows how attached to the characters one can get.
Anyways, Buy the tape! See the series if you haven't and bring a kleenex or two just in case. It's shonen, but it as tear jerking as any shoujo equivalent.",981417600,,756,4.220689655172414
