6701286,4,B00O1D3C66,"Agree with the first reviewer, these are all very cute Christmas movies.  I have seen all of them so feel I can review them.  If you enjoy Hallmark 12 Days of Christmas movies, these are from past years and you'll enjoy these as well.  I like that there is a Thanksgiving themed one in the collection as Thanksgiving often is overlooked in the movie category.
However, as the first reviewer pointed out, I really would hate for someone to pay the price someone is asking here.  I buy all my dvds on Amazon but since this one wasn't available, I purchased this one for $9.99 at Walmart.",1417651200,23,585,4.4392523364485985

6701352,4,B00O1D3C66,Baby's First Christmas was a bit over the top. As if the writers threw in everything but the kitchen sink. But the others were fun and Bride For Christmas looked hokey but turned out to be most believable with some snappy lines.

There always seems to be one GREAT movie, one that's ok and two that should never have made it onto the air or onto a DVD.  But for the price, I am willing to gamble on getting more than one 'keeper'.  Of the four movies on here, 'Bride For Christmas' is that one great keeper.

6701366,5,B00O1D3C66,"Hallmarks Version of  "" Runaway Bride"" is a Much Better Film
Julie Roberts and Richard Gere starred in 1999's ""Runaway Bride"". This was the 2nd collaboration for the two actors. In 1990 they starred in the box office smash ""Pretty Woman"" and they delivered another box-office hit ""Runaway Bride"". However time has been kind to ""Pretty Woman"" but I can't say the same for ""Runaway Bride"". That film if it were made today would be played to empty theaters.

Hallmark Channel however ripped-off ""Runaway Bride"" with this film ""A Bride for Christmas"". This film however flows better and is 30 minutes shorter than its theatrical inspiration.  its charming and believable (to a point).  The cast is awesome.

In this film Jessie Patterson (Arielle Kebbel) calls off her third engagement - at the altar! - she swears off serious relationships until she finds ""the one."" That is, until charming but chronically single Aiden MacTiernan (Andrew Walker) comes along. Unbeknownst to Jessie, Aiden has bet his friends that he can convince a woman to marry him by Christmas - which is only four weeks away - and Jessie is the target of his bet. As Aiden attempts to court Jessie by first hiring her to decorate his apartment, Jessie looks to her sister, roommate and interior design company partner, Vivian (Kimberly Sustad) as her closest confidant. To complicate matters, Jessie is doggedly pursued by her most recent ex-fianc, Mike (Sage Brocklebank), who still wants to marry her.

Lots of fun and never boring. Watch it anytime of the year. It will make make you smile...
The other 3 films are good as well.  Well worth a purchase!",1471564800,,1623,4.88

I had seen commercials for them on TV, and didn't know if I would enjoy them, but I really did.

I don't watch much TV, so movies are my entertainment...and these four movies, they are lovely in entertainment value. My Favorites are A Bride For Christmas and Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade, but all four are great!
You can't go wrong with these movies, with this package of movies, especially for the price!!",1448755200,,457,4.7974683544303796

6701424,5,B00O1D3C66,"I am a huge fan of hallmark movies.  Especially Christmas hallmark movies.  None of these movies disappointed.  Christmas song is a charming story about two music teachers who are in direct competition with each other after learning only one of them can keep their job at the school.  Baby's First Christmas is a story about a man and a woman who don't get along even though her brother and his sister are married to each other.  When they discover her brother and his sister are having financial problems, the two must work together to save Christmas.  A Bride for Christmas is about a woman who has been engaged three times but can never make it all the way to the altar.  She decides she is never getting engaged ever again.  Meanwhile a man makes a bet with his friends to get a woman to say yes to his marriage proposal by Christmas, and his friends decide to choose the woman who has sworn off engagements for good.  I saw Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade a few years ago, but I remember it being a funny and sweet movie.  If you love hallmark movies or just feel good movies then you will enjoy these movies.",1443398400,16,1118,4.409756097560976

It's the story of two private schools that merged, one a girls' school and the other a boys' school.  Both music teachers were retained in the merger, with the male teacher working with the male singers, and the female teacher working with the female singers.  The story of how the the best male and female singers entered a Christmas song competition and the development of a romance between the two instructors.  It's a very enjoyable movie, and the music is excellent!  I couldn't get into the movie, A Bride for Christmas.  I haven't seen the other two, so I have two new movies to enjoy.",1423526400,,752,4.477941176470588
