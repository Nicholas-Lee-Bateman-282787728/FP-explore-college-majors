8226002,4,B000WXPDUW,"Released on 6/18/76, THE AMAZING WORLD OF PSYCHIC PHENOMENA is a 90 minute documentary that made the rounds of drive in theaters during America's Bicentennial summer. Host Raymond Burr doesn't just read script, he occasionally participates in this exploration of the strange and confounding.

One highlight is a test that Burr and we viewers are invited to take. We're asked to make five determinations, like which of these three women is this child's mom or, of these three photos of fish, which is still alive? These questions don't ferret out psychic abilities as much as challenge our observational and deductive skills. Yet the stories of some folks we meet go way beyond weird and coincidental.

One is absolutely astounding. A woman who's soloing a small plane under ground supervision, and who had never experienced any kind of ESP, begins to ""hear"" a specific voice calling for help. She's compelled to fly the plane 70 miles from the airfield and land in an open field. A moment later a car nearly collides with another, veers off the road, flips over in the field and starts burning. The pilot runs to the wreck and pulls the driver out through the space where a windshield had been. They walk away as the car explodes. The rescued driver is the pilot's mother! Another man's dream that his son's house was burning turned out to be true. Entertaining as these anecdotes may be, they're the stuff of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ripley-s-Believe-It-Or-Not/dp/189395109X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ripley's Believe It Or Not</a>. (For the record: I say ""not."")

Perhaps the most famous and prolific psychic was Edgar Cayce. While he slept, Cayce, who had no formal medical training, was able to diagnose illnesses and prescribe cures for people who were hundreds or thousands of miles away. Cayce swore that he'd stop doing this if his advice ever brought harm to anyone. In over 14,000 cases, his diagnoses were correct and prescribed treatments efficacious.

When this program was assembled, Uri Geller, who we see supposedly bending spoons with his mind, was still saying  he possessed psychic powers given him by extraterrestrials. In recent years Geller has modified his title from psychic to ""mystifier."" We're shown other examples of psychokinesis, like a Soviet woman who moves small things by passing her hands over them, or a man who makes dice turn up seven 60% of the time, a terrific success rate.

Psychic detectives solve crimes by touching an object belonging to the victim. One of the best known, Peter Hurkos developed his unique power after a head injury. It's said the best of these unique investigators is right 87% of the time.

Other phenomena explored include psychic photographers that create images on film by mental powers, faith healers, biofeedback practitioners, psychic acupuncturists, astral projection, a man who was clinically dead for 28 minutes then revived, and seances, including a 1928 session where Harry Houdini relayed a coded message to his wife that only they knew the meaning of. We hear an odd-sounding tape that's purported to be the spirit voice of Manson Family murder victim Sharon Tate.

A woman with a haunted house says she doesn't want to  believe it is. This segment near the program's end includes Peter Hurkos checking a lighthouse for spirit inhabitants, photographs of ghosts, and cases of reincarnation.

The effect on viewers of this thorough exploration depends on whether they believe in psychic phenomena or not. Those who do will be reassured in their convictions; those who do not won't be converted into believers. At very least, it's a thought proving presentation.
