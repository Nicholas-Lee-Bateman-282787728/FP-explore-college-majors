8354903,5,B0027LZ0KU,"I bought this DVD a year ago directly from Micheline's website. It's my favorite of the 3 and it has short practices (elixirs) that you can mix and match (no matrix). The first elixir is ""Root Power"" (18 mins) for toning hips legs & butt offers yogic squats variations , including full squats at the beginning which I don't like to do , especially when I'm not warmed up but the rest is fun yogic squats , standing cat and forward bends with fluid and creative transitions and variations , some similar to Shiva Rea's Creative Core & Lower Body. The second elixir ""Total Core Power"" (26 mins) is also somewhat similar to Shiva's Creative Core Abs but a little less challenging and features fun and creative core exercises , yogic ab exercises and bridge pose with variations.
Elixir 3 (15 min) - Dancing Warrior - 2 sun salutation variations.
Elixir 4 (26 min) - Rejuvinate - a relaxing segment of forward bends , twists , pigeon and shoulderstand. All of these elixirs are also divided in to sub chapters so you can easily skip and shorten each practice.
This DVD was shot in beautiful outdoor locations in Brazil and has great music from Shaman's Dream Rara Avis and more. I think this DVD is suitable for beginners with some experience in yoga.",1244332800,13,1247,4.596412556053812
