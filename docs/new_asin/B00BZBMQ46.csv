8575772,4,B00BZBMQ46,This tv special was Judy garlands televison debut. It was quite an accomlishment for CBS to sign her for their inagural program. Everyone now knows that judy took an overdose of medication the night before and she didn't sing live until she catually wnt on television. This is only 60 minutes long which means some footage is missing. I really like this program. it captures elements of Judys shows in the 1950s al her film songs and her singing all her famous songs. But of course her singiingover the rainbow in the hobo outfit is awesome. She is hoarse but gett sbettr throughout the program.,1462838400,,595,4.6761904761904765

8575774,5,B00BZBMQ46,"Runs only 58 minutes from original 90 minute airing.  Even substracting about 11 minutes for commercials, seems to be missing about 20 minutes.",1405814400,2,143,5.217391304347826
8575775,4,B00BZBMQ46,"This tape is a must-have for any Judy Garland fan; I thought she sang rather well and it was great to see that she had regained some weight after being too thin at the end of her MGM years. It is wonderful to know that Judy got her much deserved place in history as one of the first superstars to be on television. She sings some wonderful songs (many of which are on the album and the CD entitled Miss Show Business) and does the ""We're a Couple of Swells"" routing with David Wayne, the ""official"" host of the show. I do agree with one reviewer who said that the song performed by a young Asian lady is extraneous. This video also includes some great dance numbers by the male chorus; of course with a male chorus we must not leave out Judy's infamous ""Get Happy"" number! All in all, I highly recommend this video and I hope it is transferred to DVD. One cautionary note that made me keep this to four stars, however: the video quality is generally poor throughout most of the film. There is also a horrible type of ""glitch"" at what would have been the ending of Judy singing ""Swanee;"" I suppose something went wrong with the camera or film was destroyed. NEVERTHELESS, enjoy this fantastic record of Judy's first television appearance--BUY IT TODAY!  GRIN",1085356800,5,1257,4.465217391304348
8575776,5,B00BZBMQ46,"Many years ago, a group of us used to gather in a small apartment in lower Manhattan and watch old kinescopes (some in pretty poor condition) of Judy Garland.  We would always end with ""We're a couple of swells"" followed by ""Over the Rainbow"" which I had thought was from the Ford Star Jubilee.  Your reviewers, up until recently, have panned this tape and never mentioned the end; I thought I was mistaken and so put off buying it until now.  Well, anyone who can watch her sitting on the stage floor in that tramp outfit singing a marvelous rendition of Over the Rainbow without a tear in your eye must have emotions of steel.  The surprise was how good the rest of the concert was, with some truly memorable versions of her standard hits.  This tape is a steal at this price.  Don't pass it up!",1003968000,11,797,4.387755102040816
