7810625,5,6301290917,"Picked this up at my local goodwill shop today for the sake of collecting the mini classic series. I don't currently have a tv for which I can hook my VCR up to play it. I did however look up the cartoon and view it. Very sweet little cartoon. Felt sorry for the bear through it all, poor fella..but the animation is nice, the backgrounds are beautiful and the music is very nice too! I suggest it to any appreciator of good classic Disney animation from when it was still good. :)",1382745600,,481,4.239130434782608

It's also humorous and affectionate... Anybody who would care for a smile on their face, should choose Bongo... It's not my favorite movie, but...
