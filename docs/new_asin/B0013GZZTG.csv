8250924,5,B0013GZZTG,"This DVD is 74 minutes long and can be viewed in either Widescreen or Full screen format. It is best to listen with headphones to get the full impact of Hemi-Sync on the brain and go into states of deep meditation.

This DVD contains 12 chapters and as stated on this product page:

""LIGHTSOURCE showcases 12 sacred geometries by digital alchemist Mika Feinberg, including classics such as: The Flower of Life, The Sri Yantra, The Endless Knot, Metatron's Cube, The Kabbalah Tree of Life, and The Vesica Piscis. There are also the extravagantly beautiful new forms, Cross of the Spheres and Nested Inscribed Polygons.""

The Sacred Geometry images are stunningly beautiful and the colors gently change and move in harmony with the gentle Shamanic music.

You can watch the entire DVD or select your favorite chapters for meditation.

The Hemi-Sync audio coupled with the beautiful Sacred Geometry video does have a powerful effect, and this is the best meditation DVD I've ever seen for this purpose. The Monroe Institute produces many quality products which I also highly recommend for those who are interested.",1437955200,2,1111,5.049180327868853
