8289472,5,B001CU9DQY,"I remember this as it was the first time I heard about New Orleans police officer, Antoinette Frank.  Her and her boyfriend, Rogers LaCaze, robbed and killed three people (one a N.O. policeman) at a restaurant in New Orleans East.  She was later caught and charged and still sits on death row.

It was haunting the way the episode begin by saying ""It may be the only city in America where the guidebooks warn tourists if you want to stay out of trouble, then don't tangle with the cops because they play hardball.""  I've been to New Orleans a number of times but I never knew this fact.  I did find it a bit funny when a lady they interviewed said ""They're crooked.  I wouldn't call the cops. They'll steal more things from you than the robbers took.""",1500336000,,751,4.405797101449275
