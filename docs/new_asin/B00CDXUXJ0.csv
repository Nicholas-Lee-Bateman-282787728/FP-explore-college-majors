8580682,4,B00CDXUXJ0,I am learning Russian and this television series from Russia is not subtitled or dubbed. I use it for total saturation in the language even though I am currently a beginner. Russian people may or may not enjoy it. I don't know because I can't understand it. The picture is great and I believe that there are 8 episodes in the box.,1423612800,,330,4.338709677419355
