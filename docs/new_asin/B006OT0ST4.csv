5011117,5,B006OT0ST4,"This film noir is unusual in almost every way, except for the fact that like so many in the genre, it is beautifully shot. In fact, the film's aesthetic may be the best thing about it, and it's made all the more memorable for it's rural setting, of which it makes great use, showcasing the woods, the vast farmland, and sparkling lake. The story follows a young man who goes to work for the eccentric parents of a high school classmate, and who soon discovers that they know a deep, dark secret surrounding an abandoned house in the middle of the nearby woods. Surreal and even eerie at times, this is a melancholic masterpiece that genre fans should appreciate. The new restoration by The Film Detective is also about as good as I can possibly imagine a film of this age being - not flawless, but you can still make out all of the nice little details. Well worth a look.",1470614400,,871,4.416149068322981

5011129,4,B006OT0ST4,"This movie is well acted, if not a bit melodramatic at times, but that was the style in these early films. The atmosphere of creepiness that is created around the Ox Head Forest is wonderful. As the movie progresses we are slowly brought deeper and deeper into the forest one step at a time, starting at the edge with it's Trespass at your own risk sign to finally seeing the Red House at about the midpoint of the film. The journey through the Ox Head Forest to the Red House becomes more dangerous as we get closer to the goal. Once we finally see the house the story really starts to unfold and secrets are revealed.

I loved the movie. It's highly entertaining, slightly creepy and very mysterious. The locations, including the forest and the secluded farmhouse really drew me into the film. There were a couple points where I thought the dialog was a bit cheesy, such as when Pete warned Nath to not go into the woods and Nath just ignored him altogether. He was actually rather rude to Pete considering he had just met him. Another point that was weird and uncomfortable was when Nath's now remarried mom was leaving on her honeymoon and Nath kisses her goodby. It was a rather long and passionate kiss right on the lips. Sorry but no one kisses their mom on the lips with that much desire unless you are Norman Bates perhaps.

Overall an outstanding movie with a twisted storyline. It's a fun ride as we slowly peel back the layers and reveal the dark secrets hidden inside the Red House. I'll also note that the character of Tibby is played by a very young Julie London who went on to great success in life as a jazz singer, movie actress, TV actress and pinup girl. You may remember her as Nurse Dixie McCall on the TV show Emergency!.
Add this one to your movie collection. It's a must-have as far as I'm concerned.

The Film Detective's Blu Ray version is the one I watched. Finally a restoration has been done properly on this movie!

5011131,2,B006OT0ST4,"The Red House, 1947 film

The film begins with a view of the forests that once covered the land. Pete Morgan's farm is isolated from the other farms. A school bus takes children to school. Pete has a wooden leg, and will hire Meg's friend for help around the farm. Nate learns about the family history; Meg was adopted after her parents moved away. ""Don't take a short cut through the Oxhead woods!"" Avoid the Red House. The wind howls to provide an eerie sense. Or is it screams? The conversations provide the background to this story. Nate falls into the creek on the return home. Was it a human? Nate and Meg walk through the woods in the daylight. Pete orders Meg to stay out of the Oxhead woods. Pete doesn't want anyone trespassing in those woods!

One day Meg sneaks out of her room to walk into the forbidden woods. She sees the Red House! Will she hear rifle shots? Why doesn't she return home? They call the doctor for Meg. Nate talks to her. Pete fires Nate and orders him off his land. Ellen reproaches Pete, and we learn the secret! Tibby has feelings for Teller. What is happening to Pete? Is the Red House haunting them? Ellen goes into the woods at night. Will she be safe? Pete tells what happened years ago. The police catch Teller. Pete drives to the Red House with Meg. Nate and the police arrive to rescue her. Pete drives into the building for the final scene.

This slow paced film reminds me of a Val Lewton film. Its not scary and its not quite credible as a crime story. Would the sudden disappearance of a married couple go unnoticed? Friends or relatives would have asked questions. Who inherited their property [motive]? The real danger in those woods would be moonshiners or poachers, they don't like snoopers.",1446076800,,1740,4.5

This review refers to the standard DVD of this combo pack.  The ward figures in this mystery and her boyfriend resolves to solve it to free her  from Robinson's overprotective hold. Madness and death will soon follow. The story is suspenseful and the acting top notch as is the direction and photography. Unfortunately. the disc transfer is too dark and murky in places and too bright and washed out in others. The audio varies as well.  It's still watchable but could use some contrast work. Recommended none the less as this is probably the best version out there right now.  Robinson is superb as the tortured man trying to keep the past dead and buried.",1430352000,,881,4.965986394557823

Completely suspenseful, this is a thriller with the right ingredients (nosy neighbors, gossip, whispers and suspicions, howling and creepy sound effects) to whip up a medley of delicious nail-biting to keep you on the edge of your seat. This classic tale is that of a peaceful farmer (Pete) who lives with his sister and their adopted teen daughter (Meg). Pete lives in fear of the woods that surround his home and forbids anyone to venture in them, most of all Meg.  Meg and her friend Nathe, of course don't heed Pete's warnings and eventually this leads them to a red farmhouse that is filled with intrigue, secrets, murder, and the identity of Meg's real parents. Literally, my heart was beating out of my chest! I am thrilled to discover classic thrillers that relied on great scripts, rather that films of today that rest their weight on special effects.",1429488000,,958,4.877300613496932

5011141,4,B006OT0ST4,"This review is plucked from a review-in-progress of the Mill Creek Dark Crimes Classic Features Collection. I've set out to do a short review of each of the 50 films within the set and post them individually before posting a single long compilation for the set itself. So without further ado, let's begin:

Film number two in the Dark Crimes collection is The Red House, a 1947 adaptation of a novel by the same name written by George Agnew Chamberlain. The plot revolves around high school chums Meg (Allene Roberts) and Nath (Lon McCallister). Nath is in need of part time employment due to a decrease in business at his mother's shop, so Meg encourages him to come work for her adoptive father, Pete (Edward G. Robinson).

At the end of his first day on the job, Nath intends on taking a shortcut through the woods to quicken his journey home. Pete warns against it, spinning a tale of screams in the night; terrors unknown to the outside world. The Red House is out there, Pete tells Nath, and all who encounter it are sent fleeing into the night.

I really enjoyed The Red House. The basic premise is instantly intriguing, but as with The Mandarin Mystery, the tone initially feels cockeyed. When Nath announces his decision to venture into the woods, it feels more like you're watching an old-school horror film than a dark crimes thriller. The way dialog, music and sound effects are used to ratchet up suspense in those early scenes made me feel as though the Wolfman or the Mummy would come shuffling out of the woods. Talk about mixed messages.

Speaking of sound, the Mill Creek Entertainment version of the film features a disaster area where the audio track should be. For the most part I was able to follow what was going on, but there are moments scattered throughout when the dialog is completely indecipherable. This is particularly problematic when music and sound effects are being utilized at the same time. It's one thing for an elderly sound mix to be in rough shape, but it's another thing entirely for a third of your film's audio to sound like the blasting static you encounter on a portable radio while vacationing in Silent Hill. With a 100 minute runtime, this kind of audio quality can turn even the most engaging movie into an extremely long sit.

Picture fidelity isn't much better. The film print looks as though it was run through a briar patch on its way to be transferred to a digital format, and I suspect Mill Creek Entertainment used a duplicate of a duplicate of a duplicate. Scenes set at night tend to be much too dark, while daytime scenes look as though they were lit by the gentle, soft-focused glow of a nuclear explosion. I spent about two-thirds of the movie wondering why the skin wasn't painfully peeling from the actor's bones, as well as waiting for Ghouls, Super Mutants and Radscorpions to invade Pete's farm.

Having said all of that, there is a bright side: in 2012, a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack was released by Film Chest and HD Cinema Classics. The movie was restored using the original 35mm elements, which means that despite aggressive use of DNR to clean up film grain, the Blu-ray looks and sounds far better than the el cheapo DVD included in the Mill Creek Entertainment collection. These 50 movie sets tend to MSRP for around $10, so you get what you pay for.

Moving away from technical specs, I have to give a shout out to the film's cast. Everyone involved gives a fairly good performance, but special mention must be made of Edward G. Robinson. A performer known largely for playing mob heavies and gruff curmudgeons, Robinson gives a performance here that is equal parts tender and uncanny. I can't say too much without spoiling the plot -- that's right, I refuse to spoil a 67-year-old movie -- but he manages to flip from sympathetic to unnerving and back again at the drop of a hat. It takes a certain kind of performer to pull that off, and Robinson definitely fits the bill.

Allene Roberts also deserves praise for her turn as Meg. She easily embodies a character who is stoic yet vulnerable; reserved yet warm. When she smiles it lights up the screen, but when her demeanor shifts toward a broodier mood she takes on the icy stillness of a porcelain doll. She never smolders for the camera in the same way as co-star Julie London -- an actress who absolutely scorches the screen with her femme fatale allure -- but there's something extremely appealing about her nevertheless. It's kind of amazing that Nath never notices Meg noticing him. Teenage boys are dumb.

So that's The Red House, done and dusted. If you're into film noir and psychological thrillers, I suggest picking up the stand alone blu-ray version. I probably will, as it'd be nice to see the thing again with dialog that isn't about 30% incomprehensible.",1411430400,,4792,4.67497034400949

5011149,5,B006OT0ST4,Edward G Robinson can seem both a nice guy and a man with not-so-nice hidden depths.  The film is a real thriller and it is hard to guess the secret surrounding The Red House in the woods. It is all played out well.  Judith Anderson is an actress I really enjoy watching and I love her voice.  The young ones in the film all play their roles well and Rory Calhoun is so handsome.  One gets caught up in the story as it unfolds to it's denouement.  A film not to be missed.,1392940800,,472,4.032258064516129
5011150,4,B006OT0ST4,"For the price, this is a good purchase. The film itself is an engaging little noirish psychological thriller with supernatural elements. It is well-paced and compelling. The script, direction, and cinematography are all more than adequate. The score is quite good. Edward G. and the cast, including the teenaged cast members, do fine work. It builds to a suspenseful conclusion and is worth the time for any old film or noir buff.

The Blu-ray transfer is okay. To be honest it looks more like a really, really good DVD transfer. It lacks the crisp detail of true HD quality. But I was not that disappointed because it was very watchable. As fans of old fairly obscure films know, you would tend to be happy with that level of quality since in many cases, films from this era are not available on DVD at all, let alone Blu-ray, or if they are, the image is poor. My personal test for old films is that if you can see the actor's irises in their eyes, then it's a pretty good transfer. This certainly passes that test. The sound quality is adequate, mono, about what you'd expect from a 1947 film, no better or worse. The dialogue is clear and there wasn't much hiss or distortion. I didn't actually compare the quality on the included DVD disc. Basically, at this price, if you're interested in the film, I'd say ""go for it"". I don't regret the purchase.",1390521600,,1354,4.549180327868853
5011151,5,B006OT0ST4,"The Red House was released originally on March 16, 1947, and is a little film noir gem that alas did not receive the acclaim as other noir masterpieces from the period.

The cast contains some of the best noir actors from the period including Edward G. Robinson in the title role as a mad obsessed man,  Judith Anderson of Rebecca fame as his sister, and the very beautiful Julie London as the jealous sex kitten dating Lon McCallister as a rather dorky farm boy in a love triangle with the sweet an innocent ""adopted daughter of Edward's character.. Allene Roberts.  Rory Calhoun plays the hunky rogue in love with Julie's character.  The musical score was by master Miklos Rozsa who used the eery theramin to great effect as he did in the soundtrack for Hitchcock's Spellbound.

The whole movie is rather atmospheric, and is great for a late night thriller.  However I'm rather insulted that The Blu-Ray did not digitally master the sound for this movie (which needs a lot of restoration help) Hopefully a company like Criterion will take it on. Also the extras were very skimpy.

As the writer of Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London Handbook which celebrates the life of Julie London including her career in music and film, I was so surprised with all of the historical information on this film including The LIFE magazine spread on all four youths in this film as well as the news reel interviews and historical tv/movies bios for Robinson, London and Anderson that none of that was included.

The Red House is a must for all film noir, Ed. G Robinson or Julie London fans, but again the quality of the blu-ray is only mediocre of the Big Lots Bargain bin variety... which is insulting to the amazing talents in this movie.",1388534400,,1733,4.677631578947368

5011153,4,B006OT0ST4,"Up until now, I had only the Madacy release (Tough Guy series)
of Red House (1947) which was filled with scratches,
overly dark night scenes, a bit blurry, etc.

The new Blu-ray release from HD Cinema Classics is vast
improvement, but it does have one problem: there is too much contrast
which tends to wash out some of the daytime scenery and sometimes
the detail in the faces. If you lower the contrast setting
on your TV, it will look better. It's not that much of an issue,
but since it is a Blu-ray release, I expected better.

The cast, headed by Edward G. Robinson, Judith Anderson, Lon McCallister,
Allene Roberts, Julie London and Rory Calhoun, give solid performances.

This thriller focuses on the mysterious red house hidden deep
in the woods. We slowly learn that the old abandoned house holds
a terrible and haunting secret, which is revealed in the
explosive and exciting ending.

The audio commentary is not very worthwhile. The commentator has
great respect for Edward G. Robinson and the other actors,
but his presentation is awkward and there are long pauses between
his words. He basically comments on what we can see on the screen
for ourselves. This commentary was very disappointing.",1383523200,,1206,4.839805825242719

Also, this version of the film is based on a poor quality film print, has scratches and jitters at the beginnings of reels, and it's a little hard to tell what is happening in some of the washed out night scenes (particularly those of Lon Mccallister in the woods). Still, I've watched it in this form five or six times and have enjoyed the story every time. If you want more value for your money, buy the Triple Feature version and get The Stranger and Scarlett Street as well, both good movies.

""You stay out of those woods! I've never laid hands on you in my life, but I'll take the whip to you if you do!""

This film is really quite entertaining. In style, it approaches the feeling of film noir, and yet there is an unusual eeriness which is not unlike a ghost story. Though the film does not deal with the supernatural, it will give you goose bumps and make you grateful to see this by your fireside rather than daring the windswept, nocturnal terror of Ox Head woods.

Miklos Roza's musical score incorporating a little bit of creepy Theremin really adds a chill to the atmosphere of this tale.

The story: farmer Pete Morgan, his matronly sister Ellen and their adopted teenage daughter Meg live on a secluded but prosperous farm. The setting is lovely - absolutely pastoral. However, bordering the Morgan farm is a foreboding forest called Ox Head woods. Pete is a fairly easy-going farmer, but from an accident earlier in his life he is missing a leg. Needing help on the farm he hires Nath, a likeable and hard-working high school friend of Meg's. With Nath's arrival, a mystery soon begins to surface and events become increasingly unsettling and ominous.

Nath must walk an hour to get home from the Morgan farm. To save time, he decides to go through Ox Head woods at night against Pete Morgan's emphatic and frightening warning to go around it. As the story progresses, it becomes apparent that the woods hold a secret which involves - The Red House. Pete yells to Nath as he sets off for the woods disregarding Pete's warning, ""Screams...from The Red House! Did you ever run away from a scream?! It will follow you through the woods! It will follow you all your life!"" We are then treated to a truly scary walk in the woods which will make the hairs on the back of neck stand up. And so begins the mystery which Nath and Meg must solve.

I recommend this film and for the most part it might be considered appropriate for family entertainment though some 1940's-style film violence is depicted.",1352764800,,2500,4.544444444444444

My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Edward G. Robinson takes the lead in THE RED HOUSE, portraying an aging farmer who lives off the beaten path with his spinster sister and the young girl they took in as a baby, but who is now nearing adulthood.  Finding that age is getting the better of him, Robinson eventually decides to hire a local boy to help with the chores, even though he seems hesitant to bring an outsider into their lives.  Then, one dark and stormy night, Robinson nearly goes berzerk as the hired boy, anxious to get home ahead of the storm, decides to take a shortcut through the nearby Ox-Head woods.  Robinson does all he can to dissuade the boy and convince him to go around, at last crying out, cryptically, that he'll never outrun the screams that come from the Red House.

Well, there are certainly plenty of fans for this film, at least here on Amazon, but I have to admit that I really didn't care too much for this Edward G. Robinson vehicle.  While it seems the main focus of the film is to establish a sort of creepy suspense around the history of these characters, I thought Robinson's attitude toward his budding teenage daughter was far creepier.  I suppose that within the storyline of the film, his attention makes sense, and is less predatory than misguided, but it still seems unsettling in a way that I'm not sure the filmmaker's intended.

Robinson is a powerful presence though, and he does carry the film.  THE RED HOUSE also marks the first credited appearance of Rory Calhoun and an early turn from Julie London (the singer, and Dixie from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emergency/dp/B0009UC80G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emergency!</a>) - London's performance as the Daisy Mae Scragg look-alike 'Tibby' is worth two stars alone.  (Come to think of it, Calhoun bears more than a passing resemblance to Li'l Abner himself, though with a much darker character.)  But aside from these few positives, the film never really grabbed me.  Along with Robinson's somewhat fawning character, the film also fails to capitalize on the suspenseful beginning.  Once the hired boy, Nath, enters the Ox-Head woods, there is a moment of genuine tension, but I thought the resolution from that point on was rather mundane and predictable.

Those film fans who feel modern movies have too gritty or rough an edge should appreciate THE RED HOUSE - it is not totally without suspense, but I think it will be difficult for most viewers who are used to darker, more shocking material to muster up much enthusiasm for it. I couldn't.  Two-and-a-half stars.

The version by Popflix that I watched was presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio with a runtime of 100 minutes, which matches up with the Alpha Video numbers for their individually packaged disc.  My version had plenty of scratches and artifacts in the print, and audio was very scratchy for the first part of the film - the worst by far of any of the six films on the Popflix set.

The plot is highly predictable and the scare factor didn't live up to what I expected based on other reviews.  After looking up the ""whatever-happened to"" details of the careers of the two young lead actors  in the film, Lon McCallister and Allene Roberts, I was not surprised that their acting careers produced little beyond this film.  However, much on the positive side, I was reminded of the outstanding acting ability of Edward G. Robinson who redeemed a pedstrian role with the same intensity he poured into his other, more memorable ones.  Robinson was a consummate actor who deserved more honor than he received in his career.  If you are into B movies of the 1940's, you will probably find this one enjoyable but not likely a favorite.

This print even includes the original United Artists opening, which had been clipped off on some of the previous presentations.
 As for the film itself, THE RED HOUSE may not be one of the all-time great mystery movies, but the story really holds your attention and it's got a marvelously eerie atmosphere, thanks to acclaimed writer and director Delmer Daves (A SUMMER PLACE, SPENCER'S MOUNTAIN).

He may be a fine author (he is listed as having written several film books), but this is undoubtedly the worst film commentary I've ever heard. Hare's commentary is ""scene-specific,"" but he merely restates what is happening on the screen. When I choose to listen to a commentary, I expect to learn something beyond what I've already observed, not to be provided a verbal summary of what is happening on the screen. I found the commentary insulting to the viewer's intelligence and suspect that Mr. Hare simply ""didn't do his homework."" This is a real shame because there's a lot of meat in this film to dig into.

5011179,5,B006OT0ST4,"My introduction to this movie came at age 6. Back in the day before cable tv, commercial tv stations flooded the air waves with old films many of which were in what is still known as the public domain. This is a nice way to say that some cluck didn't renew the rights to a film and it could be shown on tv without paying the customary residuals.
I saw this on a daily movie show known as the Early Show. I'm not certain as to why any responsible programmer would schedule this movie for an afternoon audience and have to guess that my mom was busy with other things, but this movie scared me silly. I was shaking for days and having bad dreams. It made quite an impression on me.
Fast forward to when I met my husband in college. We were/are a couple of old movie fans. We started talking about movies that seemed sort of normal but terrified us and creeped us out as kids. Interpret that to mean we excluded horror movies. Our #1 choice was this movie and #2 was The Two Mrs. Carrolls.
The thing about both movies is that on the face of it, the lead character in both movies seem sort of normal-----at first. As the movies roll out it is pretty apparent that both of these characters are over the edge and things are going to go downhill fast as the situation gains momentum as things in real life often do. In this movie, Edward G. Robinson goes radically against type. It doesn't help that Judith Anderson is his sister, though she goes against type in this one, too. Unforunately, you don't get Mrs. Danvers thrown into the mix. You can read the synopsis of this movie to clue you in on the plot, but you'll have to take my word on this that this movie is one of the best creepy movies that was turned out in the late '40's.
There is some irony that this film was made on a shoe string budget and had only two big name actors in it. The rest of the cast was either on its way out (oddball WWII heartthrob Lon McCallister) or on its way in (Rory Calhoun and Julie London).
Most of the available copies of this film are in poor condition(grainy and with rotten sound quality), but I am hoping the upcoming DVD version is cleaned up and given a new life.
As a testament to this film's worthiness, I usually don't bother with poor copies of a movie, but this is an exception. Robinson's over-the-top performance might be viewed as excessive, but I think it was called for in this movie and was undoubtedly under rated.
I just watched this again last night and it still scares me.",1333238400,,2479,4.276595744680851

While it may no longer have the same grip and the whole turned out to be less than the sum of its parts, the most lasting quality is the music by the late great MIKLOS ROZSA, NOT Max Steiner as one reviewer noted. Fresh from composing and receiving an Oscar for Spellbound and A Double Life, and an Oscar nomination for The Lost Weekend, Rozsa added a dramatic and nerve wracking score that was the underpinning for the entire film and helped to solidify the standard he helped to establish for psychological dramas. All we hear today is the trite comment, especially on Soap Operas: ""Secrets must come out.""  Yes, they do unless you keep your mouth shut! In The Red House, it is a long kept secret that finally does in a major character, though the real wonder is how ""it"" remained a secret for so long.

Beautiful cinematography from Bert Glennon and an atmospheric score from Miklos Rozsa set a very special mood as young rural love struggles against buried secrets in the woods. Daves does an excellent job balancing the tender romance of a lonely young girl with a noir drama of stark intensity. Allene Roberts stands out as the sweet young girl trying to blossom, giving a memorable performance. Lon McCallister is also quite good as the young farm boy who comes to slowly care for her against his shallow but sultry girlfriend's wishes. The centerpiece of the film is an ominous red house deep in the woods that holds a paralyzing fear for Edward G. Robinson. Sort of a cross between Our Town and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers in mood, it all works somehow, creating a memorable film experience.

Daves captures both the sweetness and beauty of country life using Glennon's camera and a lovely score by Rozsa to frame young Meg. Allene Roberts is the real star of this film despite fine performances from screen veterans like Robinson and Judith Anderson. Meg is a nice girl who can't compete with the sultry Tippy (Julie London) for the affections of Nath (Lon McCallister) on her level, but has depth and sweetness the viewer hopes Nath will choose instead. Pete Morgan (Edward G. Robinson) hires him on as help to Meg's delight, but soon Pete's strange and paranoid behavior regarding the woods intrudes on all their lives. Only his sister, Ellen (Judith Anderson) knows the truth, and she isn't talking. Anderson is fine as a woman who has sacrificed any happiness she might once have had with the town doctor to stay on the farm with her brother and help raise the adopted Meg. Warnings and even threats from Pete about the woods and the red house only heighten the curiosity of Nath and Meg, however.

A rural atmosphere and innocent romance complicated by a dark mystery make for engrossing viewing. Julie London is good as Nath's shallow and fickle girlfriend, lured by the danger of Teller (Rory Calhoun), the guy Pete has hired to keep everyone away from the red house and those ominous woods that scream. Things escalate and misunderstandings ensue before Ellen will take matters into her own hands in an effort to save Meg from the fate of her family. Obsession and murder will be revealed in a fitting end for all concerned, including Nath and Meg.

5011185,4,B006OT0ST4,"There's a lot of star-power hidden away in this relatively obscure film. Edward G. Robinson gives a wrenching performance as a man weighted with a secret. Judith Anderson, who was better known for her acclaimed stage performances as Lady MacBeth, has us guessing whether here she's again an evil provocateur, or just an innocent enabler. Julie London, better known as a sultry singer, does a wonderful job playing a shallow and calculating young seductress.

This movie is not really a horror film though, as it's advertised on its DVD jacket. It starts out trying to veer that way as the young people make their way through the woods, struggling against the mystique of the place and the wailing winds.

Actually though, this is more of a psychological drama, with a surprisingly adult undertow of a theme centering on Robinson's obsessive, possessive attitude towards his stepdaughter. So there's a touch of ""A View from the Bridge"" here.

This film also includes an intriguing love story. Will the nice young man fall prey to the callous temptations of Julie London's character? Or will he pause long enough (and survive long enough) to realize the worth of Robinson's sweet and understated stepdaughter, who obviously comes with a lot of family baggage.

The resolution of the secret that has been haunting this family might seem a little tame for modern audiences used to an extravagance of grisly mayhem. It might seem that Robinson anguished too much and too long over his not-quite-buried past. But you have to get into the mood and the mores of the 1940's when this film was made and enter into this rural American setting on its own terms.

The only thing that tends to undermine the overall excellence of ""The Red House"" is its musical score. It's the sort of melodramatic, intrusive score that hyped the action in many Grade B movies from the 1940's-1970's. You might want to turn down the sound on your set during these blarings so you can retain the moodiness of the piece. There is even prominent use of a Theremin in the score. A Theremin is that hands-off instrument in which you can conjure notes out of thin air by waving your hand through an electromagnetic field. The instrument was usually used for the scores of Grade B movies to ""Oooooooh"" waveringly announce the coming of a ghost or the landing of an alien spaceship. However, that strikes the wrong note for this generally realistic human drama.

One other caveat for modern audiences - the DVD jacket shows colorized shots. But the film is actually in Black-and-White. So you can't really see the blood-red color of the house-in-the-woods. That ominous detail and many others are left to your imagination.

The only extra on this DVD is a listing of Alpha Video's other offerings. Scrolling through these mostly Grade B or Grade C movies (The Creature from...) is a blast from the past. I wonder how the serious ""Red House"" got mixed up with this goofy bunch.",1278374400,,2937,4.827037773359841

Just a few years before her tragic suicide, the beautiful Ona Munson has a bit part as Nathan's widowed mother.  All of this is made even more sinister by intense BW filming and a superb score by Miklos Rosza - as good as any by Bernard Hermann.  Highly recommended and gets better with each viewing.  For some reason, this ""enhanced"" version has been cropped into 1.85:1 when the film was originally 4:3.  It looks ridiculous but can be corrected by the settings on the DVD player.  All the versions I have seen on DVD are pretty beat up - this one included.  This is a film that desperately needs someone like Criterion to find an original master, clean it up and re-master it.  Curiously, the original novel (same title) by George Agnew Chamberlain (a fairly prolific writer) is impossible to find on Amazon, in libraries, or second hand.",1255996800,,1611,4.925925925925926

5011193,5,B006OT0ST4,"THE RED HOUSE deserves better - it really begs for a restoration. It's a terrific ""little"" film - Superbly realized in EVERY department. But I am writing this as a warning, not a film review.
BEWARE of everything sleazed out of Alpha Video! This is the schlock company who brought us such gems as: I EAT YOUR SKIN, NABONGA, THE SEXORSIST, and the imortal; EEGAH (!). Alpha specializes in out of copywrite ""B"" features - But unfortunately they also have some great classics: SCARLET STREET, SEVENGALI, ORPHANS OF THE STORM, and THE RED HOUSE (to mention a few, that Alpha treats with the same disreguard for quality as they do EEGAH.)
I knew not to expect much - but THE RED HOUSE is not available from a respectable company (Alpha is NOT) - and until it is, (doubtful) I'd have to ""make do"" - Well let me tell ya, ""make do"" is what ya do with this Alpha desaster!
The picture is ""watchable"" - barely (scratches,streaks, contrasty, muddy darks, and glitches)- The audio is ABYSMAL (Miklos Rozsa's thrillingly moody score is all but destroyed by this rotten transfer).
How very unfortunate that a company such as Alpha is the only source for some long forgotten film treasures. Indeed it is our loss.
 WARNING: BEWARE of anything made by Alpha Video, it's at the very bottom of the DVD barrel. Everything that they offer will be of the WORST quality. But sometimes you don't have a choise if that's all that's available. I've longed to see THE RED HOUSE again for years, so decided to be another Alpha chump in order to see what I so fondly remembered. The film was as good as I'd remembered, no masterpiece, but a damned good little moody thriller.
Five Stars for the THE RED HOUSE - And a BIG BOOTED FOOT to Alpha Video (""where the sun don't shine."")!
Saving grace: it's inexpensive - as well it should be from a company with no integrity or even a semblance of quality. Order THE RED HOUSE, but know that you're getting ""the sows ear"", not the ""silk purse"".",1203465600,,1958,4.546742209631728

5011196,4,B006OT0ST4,"Great ghost story,(with a spooky haunted forest and house), a slick mystery, a grim film noir, a psychological study of guilt, together with the great Edward G Robinson.  Perfect for those who enjoy the Val Lewton, or The Haunting (the original by Robert Wise) style adult horror film.

The powerful soundtrack with what sounds like the use of the theremin (years ahead of the Day the Earth Stood Still) is by none other then the great Mikls Rzsa.

Great cinematography by Bert Glannon adds a great deal other-worldly spookiness to the night-time and dark forest scenes.

A fine opening voice over and photos of the landscape sets the eerie tone.  Describing Ox-Head woods ""Its like walking though a wall and closing the door behind you. Obsolete trails wonder vaguely, crisscross and break at right angles for no reason.""

The film has very fine performances by the entire cast including Lon McCallister, Rory Calhoon, Judith Anderson and Julie London - who were all great and took their rolls seriously in what many might consider a horror film.

A special note - There is adorable actress named Allene Roberts who may play the most  memorable character in the film. Allenes's Meg seems to reliaze that she is sexually awakened. She is cute, vulnerable, and wholesome and yet showed strength when called for. She is downright charming. Her gentle voice, sad eyes and kind face attracts your eye whenever she is on the screen, possibly to a greater degree then the classic beauty Julie London.  I would have thought that Allene's career would have been very rich. Looking her up on Wikipedia - I found that her filmography consists of a few small throwaway rolls in b movies.  Very curious and too bad. What happened?

For a film of its time there is a great deal sexual tension between the teenagers that sometimes goes beyond innuendo. For example our so called goody-good teenage hero has no problem blatantly making out with one very healthy teenage Julie London while a young Allene Roberts looks on longingly.  There are many other similar scenes with the teens stating things or staring at each other with obvious sexual overtones. I think that these quirky scenes (that seemed to indicate that anything could happen) added to the overall tension that the film produces in many viewers.

** spoiler** Robinson's trance and bewildered face as he slowly sinks into the mire near the end of the film is one of the most unforgettable and frightening scenes of poetic justice in any film

A company called HD Cinema Classics has a acquired a pristine print of the Red House and has issued it in a blu-ray combo pack. The movie now looks and sounds great. This is the only way to watch this film!

Unfortunately all other DVD versions of the Red House - including Alfa Video are in terrible shape - Blurry, dark, noisy, tears, rips, speckled and grainy.  The poor condition of these DVDs distracts from the film - stay away.",1185926400,,2926,4.78727634194831
5011197,4,B006OT0ST4,"I do not understand why this movie is so little known .The names -in front of and behind the camera-have pedigree ,and the story ,while derivative ,is always engrossing

Edward G Robinson plays "" Morgan ""  a farmer living with his sister (the ever admirable Judith Anderson)on a farm on the edge of some deep dark woods ,with his adopted daughter the sweet natured Meg .A teenage boy hires to work on the farm after school ignores Morgan's advice and returns home after work via a short cut  through the woods .He is oppressed by as ense of dread and terror and panics .Being a resolute youth he resolves to try to get to the cause of his anxiety and together with Meg begins to dig into the mystery of waht the woods conceal .The key lies in some dark deed of Morgan's past ,a thing he is anxious to keep hidden ,and pivotal to events is the eponymous house hiddden deep in the forest

There is a sub plot involving the affair between the local minx ,the sultry Julie London and a sinister youth played by a sneering Rory Calhoun

Robinson is excellent giving a finely judges performance as an essentially decent man who is concealing a shameful secret ,his air of geniality giving way to outburst of anger and rage .Anderson is perfect as his sister -watching his gradual disintegration ,trying to be supportive but aware of the need to protect potential victims of his anger

The score by Miklos Rozsa is a star in its own right -it is discorant ,relying heavily on shrieking strings -and evoking a sense of dread with masterly economy while Delmer Daves directs with efficiency and not a liitle style

5011199,5,B006OT0ST4,"Ah, the golden age of Hollywood, when films actually relied on strong stories to build suspense and keep audiences riveted to the screen.  I had never really heard of The Red House (1947) until recently, but this is one heck of a good film.  It sometimes gets associated with film noir, but I would describe it as more of a psychological thriller.  It features a strong cast, including the likes of Edward G. Robinson, Judith Anderson, and Rory Calhoun (as well as a wonderful young actress named Allene Roberts), a wonderful musical score by Miklos Rozsa, and a plot that methodically works itself out to great effect.

Young Meg (Roberts) lives on a quiet country farm with Pete Morgan (Robinson) and his sister Ellen (Anderson), having been taken in by the Morgans as a two-year-old following the death of her parents.  Everything is calm and peaceful until Meg talks Pete into hiring some extra help in the form of young Nath Storm (Lon McCallister).  When Nath says he is taking a shortcut through the woods, Pete goes off half-cocked and starts ranting about the woods being haunted, screams in the night, and the evils of a red house.  Nath soon comes running back to the farm, but he is determined to figure out the secret of those woods.  Meg also wants to know why she has always been forbidden to enter the woods, and the two of them sneak off several times to go exploring.  Pete becomes more unsettled as the movie progresses, as dark memories begin to bubble to the surface of his mind, and the viewer is eventually forced to question his motives.  There is plenty of drama and suspense (and a touch of young love) before the dark secrets of The Red House are revealed, all of which contribute to the film's remarkably dark and somewhat eerie atmosphere and a surprisingly effective conclusion.  To my mind, Robinson tends to overplay his part at times, but Allene Roberts comes into her own and plays opposite his character extremely well.

Some viewers found some of the scenes in the dark woods to be scary, but modern audiences will almost surely find nothing the least bit scary about this film.  Suspense, though, still abides here in droves, helped along quite effectively by an orchestral score featuring the theremin (which was used predominantly in early science fiction films).  Younger viewers might sometimes grow a little impatient with the slow and steady nature of the plot, but it is the strength of that plot that makes The Red House a somewhat overlooked classic.",1115942400,,2496,4.761020881670533
5011200,4,B006OT0ST4,"Deemed as one of Martin Scorsese's most influential films, ""The Red House"" is a cinematic treasure.  ""The Red House"" is classic film-noir, using extreme shadows and camera angles to advance the plot line.  The film is set in a small peaceful, rural, community in the 1940's.  Pete Morgan and his sister, Ellen Morgan, have adopted Meg, now a young teenage woman, whose parents had died shortly after her birth.  As the story develops doubt arises over Meg's past and the secrets of the mysterious Ox Head Woods located on the Morgan farm. As the intrigue into the past continues, Pete slips between sanity and insanity, between the present and the past.  While Ellen attempts to ground Pete, Meg begins to unravel secrets of her own past.  The plot is edgy and suspenseful.  The music seamlessly fits into the film with brilliant composition.  Edward G. Robinson, who plays Pete Morgan, gives an over the top performance that works for this film.  He is haunted by his past and reminded daily with the haunting figure before him - Jeanie.  ""The Red House"" is one of my favorite films and is a film which should not be overlooked.  Plot line: A  Acting: A-  Cinematography: A+  Music: A  Overall: A",1113696000,,1197,4.742718446601942

shut off about ten minutes before the end, so I'm still in the dark as to the secret of the red house! It's the kind of movie where missing the ending isn't just an annoyance that you can forget about. It's incredibly engaging, and despite the often crummy picture quality, it'll take you in and make you insanely curious about the red house's secret, too. There are a few cheesy parts, but that just adds to it, I think.

In The Red House, he is still a nice guy, but tougher and more intrepid. He is determined to uncover the secret of the Ox Head woods, even though in the end several people die. The film achieves moments of real eerieness for what might otherwise be dismissed as a B-film. I like the 1940's atmosphere, where people maintained a family altar and doctor's made house calls.

The hero tells his girlfriend that he'll have to ""bust open"" the ""red house"" to get to the bottom of the mystery.  Hmmmm.  Robinson's character seems to have a sexual interest in his adopted daughter.  All that and a big bad wolf character that seems to hang out in the woods all day (and night) looking for stray girls.

Lon McCallister is fine in what is really the lead role, and a very fine performance by young Allene Roberts (whatever happened to her!). The DVD is pretty much of the bargain-bin variety, though there are a couple of little extras on it...most notably explaining that Robinson's career came to a standstill after this film because of the Hollywood blacklist.

The one problem was that Edward G. Robinson had to hang on to the secret of the woods for a long time during the movie, and it became a little stale to hear him tell the kids to stay out of the woods without telling them why. It's a small quibble, hey, it's a plot that is firmly planted in a small town, so they can't move the story past the woods.

I was fascinated to take in the 1940s beauty of Columbia CA and Sonora CA, which are located 75 miles west of Yosemite just outside Stanislaus Forest.  It was a simpler time back then, and likely much harder, but the countryside and people were photographed so lovingly, it seemed idyllic.
