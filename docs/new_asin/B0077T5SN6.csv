5062997,3,B0077T5SN6,"I love this show! I always have. This is a review of the DVDs themselves. Most of them came with a discoloration on discs that caused skipping and freezing. I am overseas in Japan with the Navy so shipping it back would have been hard. I used a disc cleaner/grinder to clear a layer of the discs which did make them work without further problems. I shouldn't have had to do that with a brand new DVD set.

I also with they included the PSAs with each episode as originally aired instead of having them as extras. I would prefer that than constant commercial bumpers throughout each show. ""G.I. Joe will be right back.... And now back to G.I. Joe..."" That should have been an extra instead of the PSAs.

Otherwise, it is great watching this classic show! They really don't make them like this anymore.",1360368000,18,800,4.472602739726027
5062998,3,B0077T5SN6,"I grew up on this series, bought the toys and almost every tie in to G.I. Joe.  I was very excited to see this release, I really wanted to the series but the foot locker was just over kill.  First the packaging is well done, simple but informative.  They basically repackaged the 4 DVD sets that had been previously released in one collection with a bonus outer slip case.

The overall audio and video of the series is pretty good but nothing to write home about.  All the special features, PSA's etc that are included on the individual releases are intact.

The biggest gripe I have is the discs I originally received where either manufactured wrong or covered in some sort of solvent.  The discs played fine in my tray loading DVD player but I was afraid to use them in my slot loading PS3.  My only fear is the discs not lasting after repeated viewings due to the above issues.

Only time will tell, hopefully this does not affect the health of this box set.",1357603200,10,961,4.4147727272727275
5062999,5,B0077T5SN6,"Was so happy when my son opened this series after Christmas - the quality and sound are wonderful, the picture is clear, and having the entire series all in one package made his day!

5063000,3,B0077T5SN6,"Both G.I. Joe & Transformers Original TV Series were created by the same studio, SunBow/Marvel and they did a great job. Even if some of it seems a bit corny since you've grown up, the animation, story lines, characters etc. are in my opinion one of the best we have had in TV Animation especially in the 80s.

The bad news is the same studio (whoever they are? Rhino? Shout?) who remastered Transformers, also did this. So it suffers from the same issues.

-Video Remastered from original 35mm film with no proper 3:2 pull down with aliasing (jaggies) appearing.

-Some video (missing from film masters) is replaced with the old analog broadcast masters which appear ""out of place"" since they lower quality.

-Audio is never consistent on mixing voices and sound effects, varies from episode to episode. Sometimes sound effects are to loud and can't hear the voices, other times voices are to loud and barely hear the sound effects.

-Text on ending credits is new, uses a different and smaller font then the original TV masters did.

Like with Transformers overall this is nice, but I still would have personally preferred either a ""professional remaster"" OR a remaster of the original analog masters...not this half-ass crap which is inconsistent.",1355529600,41,1250,4.928571428571429
5063001,2,B0077T5SN6,"This is not about the TV series, but about the discs themselves. The first set I ordered had some sort of residue all over the disc surface. I tried to remove it, only to make it worse. I returned it and got another set, and the second set had the exact same problem. I would not want to play these in my ps3 or blu-ray player only to cause damage. Really, the disc surface looks terrible! Like they have dry glue on them or something. If I never accidentally dropped one on the floor, I might have never even noticed. Now, I am really going to make sure to check discs when I buy them. Luckily, I did not sell my Collector's Edition which I had planned to replace with this. I just wanted something that took up less space. Oh, well. I tried... twice.",1353110400,31,752,4.1931034482758625
5063002,5,B0077T5SN6,this set is great loved it growing up in the 80's the only thing that would have made this set perfect is if the psa's were left in the episodes as when the episodes originally aired the psa's were always at the end of the episode before the ending credits i don't know why the people who put this set out didn't think to make sure the episodes were left completely intact right now im watching disc 1 and no psa's included in the episodes i'm someone who likes to watch the old shows exactly the way they originally aired on tv minus the commercial breaks this should have been better thought out before releasing the set maybe on future sets of old cartoons they can keep the episodes completely intact,1497657600,8,704,4.3816793893129775

5063005,1,B0077T5SN6,extremely poor company.  too bad someone else doesn't do a re-master with sound that is good and discs that actually work.  I see online many have had issues with this company (Shout Factory).  They kept telling me they would send a replacement disc for the one that didn't work but never did.  sent them my proof of purchase multiple times to which they then started ignoring me.  I think they were just trying to get me past the warranty return date.  I would have been able to get past the bad production if they would have just replaced the one disc but with the customer service I got from them I will never buy another item from them.  Unfortunately I already have several.,1485216000,9,679,4.471544715447155

5063014,4,B0077T5SN6,A long time running series in the 80s. A very good series i might add. Like Transformers I watched this show after school back in my high school days  The whole first series in one box. With out the movie. It would have been good if the movie was included.  The box art is nice. It has a camouflage style with the GI Joe logo all over it. The box contains 8 jackets. Two discs in each jacket. The discs have the art work of the Action figure package on them. I though that was a nice touch. I thought the idea was good. For me the most memorable episode was Arise Serpentor Arise. Ive seen it both in its 5 part mini series format and in a movie format. Through out the show like transformers there is some humor. Its still a good series. Its a good addition to my DVD collection. There are also sets by seasons. This box is those season sets put into one box all together. Someday i'm thinking of getting the movie and Series two to complete the set.,1472515200,2,951,4.135135135135135

5063031,4,B0077T5SN6,"I bought this set in late November last year and can confirm that there is some kind of manufacturing defect on the discs.  Most discs have a hazy white residue on them.  The good news is that the residue cleans up very well.  I took ordinary 70% isopropyl alcohol and wiped the discs.  Then, just to make sure, I played them on my PC's optical drive.  They worked like a charm, for each and every disc.  For the price, this would be a 5-star set.  Collect my childhood into a single box?  Yes, please!  However, the manufacturing defect that folks have been complaining about for years still persists and as such merits a full star deduction.",1443139200,2,643,4.474137931034483

5063038,4,B0077T5SN6,"So GI Joe: An American Hero is something that most 80's and 90's kids recognize. The adventures of Duke and his joes are in a complete collection. So, what could go wrong? The idea that, unlike the Transformers collection, it is not all in one case. You instead get multiple collections. Talking about deception in advertising.

But on the other hand, if you love GI Joe, then you are going to adore this. Your kids are going to adore this, heck... most of anyone will for that matter!

My final word is that the DVDs are perfectly playable, but the packaging is not what you may think it is.",1431561600,2,592,4.422018348623853

""Knowing is half the battle."" Kids across North American will enjoy this cartoon for years to come. I miss the 1980s and watching this cartoon brings back memories of those years.

5063077,4,B0077T5SN6,"Cons: The first four discs (Set 1.1) all have some kind of film on them. This was mentioned in other postings but I was hoping to get lucky; it didn't happen. I used a soft cloth with Windex and softly cleaned them after spraying the cloth. Then I dried them with another softer cloth and they cleaned up fine along with looking like new discs but I have to play them to see if it worked.
Pros: Great memories from being a child, plain and simple good vs. evil, and it's G.I. Joe. The smaller containers are a major plus as well instead of the big ones they originally were in.",1382486400,,577,4.207207207207207
5063078,5,B0077T5SN6,My favorite cartoon! I'm so glad that I found this box set. I would buy it again in a heartbeat!,1381622400,,96,3.85
5063079,5,B0077T5SN6,Great DVD. It was what was promised. The quality of the DVDs are great and you'll have not problems. Great!,1378771200,,107,4.4
5063080,3,B0077T5SN6,It is the complete 1st series but I had the same trouble that others had with the sticky stuff on the discs and it seemed like some of the scenes were a little off; like the faces smile weird.. I had to return mine because I wasn't going to pay for sticky DVDs..,1375315200,,262,3.9622641509433962
5063081,1,B0077T5SN6,"I read the reviews and still took a chance on these.  There's residue or glue all over the discs.  I've never seen this before on a DVD.  I ordered a replacement, but same issue.  I tried a CD polisher and Pledge, but nothing seems to work.  I will be returning these.",1368489600,7,268,4.176470588235294
5063082,5,B0077T5SN6,one of my favorite cartoons the g.i.joe one of the best action i watched them when i was little now that im am grown up still watched them,1368403200,,138,3.9642857142857144
5063083,5,B0077T5SN6,This series is a classic! But it was sols separately and was pretty expensive.  Now with this whole set of all the Series 1 definitely worth it,1368144000,,143,4.296296296296297
5063084,5,B0077T5SN6,If you have a cd scratch remover or cd polisher I fully recommend using it.  4 of the disks are completely dirty right out of package.  A quick cleaning and its all good to go.,1366934400,,176,4.0
5063085,5,B0077T5SN6,"So I have a solution for the scuff marks that are on the discs. I know they are new & we shouldn't have to clean them but it seems to be a problem with all the discs in 1.1 & 1.2 more so in 1.1. I had bought Pledge Multi Surface spray (not foam) for used games & movies to fix scratches. It will also remove the scuff marks on these discs as well. Just remember when you go to rub the discs to go inside out & not in a circular motion so that you don't damage the disc.

Now that you have cleaned them you can play them & enjoy your childhood memories while creating new memories with your kids.",1366243200,9,595,3.877049180327869
5063086,4,B0077T5SN6,"I read through the reviews here before I ordered this, and decided to roll the dice anyway (hoping my discs wouldn't be affected like other earlier reports), and I am happy to say my discs arrived uncoated in weird stuff like the previous reviews, so hopefully that was just an earlier supply issue that has been resolved. The discs contain fairly clean copies of the episodes I remember from when I was a kid, and I fully intend to show this show to my kids (instead of letting them watch the garbage on TV now). The episodes could have been cleaned up better (you can still see plenty of artifacting, and random film detritus mucking up the picture), but it is a lot better than any old VHS copies still lying around, and I've never seen the full series available before, so overall I am happy with the set.

I am very pleased to own this entire show on DVD now.

4 stars :)",1365897600,11,876,4.335365853658536

I do wish that Amazon would have provided the complete list of all 95 episodes from Seasons 1 and 2 in the item description and details though. It would have saved me a lot of tedious searching around on the internet.
I am definitely enjoying the classic episodes of G.I. JOE: A REAL AMERICAN HERO.
I like the ""Knowing Is Half The Battle"" personal safety clips, which back in the day aired on tv at the end of each episode, just before the end credits are included in the special features, as well as the original Hasbro toy ads.",1504569600,4,591,4.381818181818182
8512200,5,B0077T5SN6,"Excellent cartoons to introduce my son to. Well-drawn, good animation, and unlike 'modern' kid-shows there's an actual story, and it generally has the good guys doing good things to beat the bad guys.",1503360000,,200,5.090909090909091
8512201,5,B0077T5SN6,"I grew up with GI Joe and had all the cool toys. I loved the GI Joe world and equipment, and it still holds up for me. This cartoon has great voices, stories, and music. As a 40+ year old I bought it because it's the only cartoon id consider watching now, and not just for the trip down memory lane. It's actually really good, and watching as an adult i can pick up on all the things i wouldn't have noticed as a kid. Yeah it's cheesy watching them like 20 feet apart shooting in the air so they don't have anybody die, but i can live with it. Very highly recommended, even if you don't know GI Joe and like anything military.",1501891200,2,626,4.056451612903226
