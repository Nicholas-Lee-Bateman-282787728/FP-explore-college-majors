5277416,5,B0098TP4MS,"This is one of the best made documentaries I have ever seen. It captures the Cambodian people's spirit, rather than trying to guilt you into donating to a cause. The story is sad, but it is a wonderful example of the human spirit and a mother's love.",1347494400,,250,4.340425531914893
5277417,5,B0098TP4MS,This is a film about the indomitable human spirit.  I found myself wanting to love my family more fiercely after watching Sang Ly's determination to deal with the realities of a very difficult life.  The images are beautiful and haunting.  I even found the film unexpectedly suspenseful which adds to its appeal for me.  I really enjoyed this film.,1347408000,,348,4.8474576271186445
8537667,5,B0098TP4MS,"I got this to show at our book club, which was discussing the book The Rent Collector, which is based on this documentary. We all loved the documentary... it is well made and well presented. We all really related to the people in the community and their lives. The second film on the DVD, Finding Sang Ly, we liked even better. Highly Recommended especially for those who have read the book The Rent Collector.",1506124800,,410,4.554054054054054

8537669,5,B0098TP4MS,Used it at my book club for The Rent Collector. Perfect. Thank you,1461974400,,66,4.153846153846154
8537670,4,B0098TP4MS,"Our book group LOVED this book, so I also ordered the video.  It was hard to watch (due to circumstances) and I have lived in Asia for a decade, traveling to places like this.  I made sure to let the group know when a ""tough to see"" part came up sometimes dimming the volume.  Well done overall!",1454889600,,295,4.140350877192983
8537671,5,B0098TP4MS,Bought this as companion to 'The Rent Collector' book.  Made it come alive. Made a great Thanksgiving gift or really anytime of year.,1386806400,,133,4.782608695652174
8537672,5,B0098TP4MS,"This book is the ""true story"" of the characters in The Rent Collector.  While some of it is hard to view, it is a perfect accompaniment to the book.  This is a powerful video  -- and it is all true.  The follow-up is especially intriguing if you have read The Rent Collector. ""Yes"", buy this video.",1384300800,,298,4.267857142857143
8537673,5,B0098TP4MS,"""River of Victory"" is the authentically told story of a mother's love fighting the chains of poverty for her beloved son.  At time shocking, at time heartwarming, the film fights through the depravity of Cambodia's largest garbage dump to reach the beautiful SE asia countryside, reuniting a broken family.  The beautiful cinematography invites the viewer to a land far away as the narrative conjures emotions of a familiar homecoming story.  Whatever your background or experience, ""River of Victory"" is sure to draw you in and gently move you to compassion.",1349827200,,559,5.188888888888889
8537674,5,B0098TP4MS,"I've seen this film at least two full times through now, and it is one of the more meaningful documentaries I've viewed. The cinematography is beautiful and the story is compelling. After a half hour or so, I began to feel like I personally knew Sang Ly. The setting is quite shocking for someone who has grown up in the insulated comfort of a first world country for a couple of decades--and this is coming from someone who lived in Brazil for two years. But the film never gives you a sense that the filmmakers were trying to exploit that shock or sensationalize the experience; rather, you sense that they are simply trying to show us that, yes, there is quite a bit that is vastly different about our homes--but, when it all comes down to it, humans are all made of the same material, and have the same emotions and needs. I'm not sure if the word ""enjoy"" is a good verb for my experience with this film, but that's because it went deeper than superficial entertainment. I am very glad I watched it, and it has made me think differently about my own experience and how it fits into the greater scheme of worldwide humanity. If you like film that challenges and educates you, without being heavy-handed or didactic, then this film is a must-see.",1349740800,8,1248,4.502202643171806
8537675,5,B0098TP4MS,"Thank you Trevor Wright and crew for this documentary about the struggles of people who, unfortunately, have to live and work in the Cambodian garbage dump!  You offer a small ray of hope to an unknown part of the world where hopelessness is so pervasive.  I hope this film spreads far and wide, and inspire others to help people in less fortunate situations all over the world.  Thank you!",1349049600,,390,4.6231884057971016
8537676,5,B0098TP4MS,"The amazing thing about this film is it's not so much about poverty and despair as it is about happiness amid turmoil and the human spirit coming through despite horrendous circumstances. Really, really moving and life changing.",1348876800,,228,5.1891891891891895
