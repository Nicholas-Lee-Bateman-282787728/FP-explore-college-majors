3148433,5,B0015XWU9A,"One of my all time favorite shows, it is too bad it did not last a few more years, I can never get tired of this show, it was funny when Brad hurt his knee and we saw him with a brace on his LEFT knee on one episode and a few more episodes later it shows Brad with a bandage RIGHT knee. I agree that some of the episodes were not as funny but it does not matter, all the bonus materials make up for this.",1214265600,,404,3.6551724137931036
3148434,5,B0015XWU9A,"All I can say is well done; Buena Vista Home Entertainment. They really did justice to this series; by adding extras to the DVD sets and this volume is no different. It has blooper reels; and also includes the ""Backstage Pass"" episode that ran right after the series finale on ABC. I remember this because it showed Wilson's (Earl Hindman) entire face in the cast introductions after the series finale ended. During the series run in the cast intro's in front of the studio audience; Wilson would come out holding a small prop of a fence on the lower part of his face and as everyone knows this was a running gag throughout the series.

It also includes the 2003 special; ""Tim Allen Presents: A Users Guide to Home Improvement"". I think I saw this on PBS a few years ago. It Has Tim, Al, Heidi and Rock (Casey Sander) in front of a live studio audience. Earl Hindman (Wilson) narrates the show; but is not seen except in film footage played throughout the show. It's live action and footage of funny moments throughout the series. But it's nice that they included it in this DVD set.

So if you are looking for family oriented entertainment and have not bought this yet; go ahead and do so; it's a great set and a nice way to end this wonderful series. I wish there were more shows on TV just like this one.",1214092800,7,1307,4.396694214876033
3148435,4,B0015XWU9A,"I've watched the season finale twice today. It's hard to believe that it's been nearly nine years since this show ended. I raised my kids on Home Improvement. It was a great family time show--not like the crap that airs on free t.v. today. There were family values, lots of laughter, and healthy relationships. It was about building bonds, building strong character, and laughter--lots of laughter. In season 8, what made Home Improvement so special doesn't always come across but there are several great episodes in this season, the finale being one of them.",1213833600,9,559,4.957446808510638
3148436,5,B0015XWU9A,"Worth every penny, This is and excellent TV Series in everyway.
Buy it - you won't be dissappointed",1212969600,,99,4.555555555555555
3148437,4,B0015XWU9A,This was a Very Funny Series. Yes there were some episodes not so funny and some were sidesplitting. To complain about the acting on a DVD release is silly. You buy the series releases because you liked the program. Not as an Emmy judge.,1212624000,7,237,4.409090909090909
3148438,5,B0015XWU9A,"We witnessed an end of an era with the conclusion of Home Improvement.  How sad it is to see the family so poorly celebrated in our present-day sitcoms!  Thank you, HI, for reminding us that we're not alone in our familial tribulations, and our desire to destroy things with power tools is not entirely a certifiable offense!  I too will be watching these DVDs many years into the future, waiting for that much-anticipated HI reunion in Paris!",1210809600,19,443,4.7272727272727275
3148439,5,B0015XWU9A,"Some of the more poignant, timely topics were covered in this season. I missed Randy, but otherwise it was so enjoyable. Bittersweet to see it all end. As any afficianado knows, it wasn't about the acting. The strength of the show was in the multitude of interactions that let us laugh at ourselves - or the people in our lives the characters reminded us of! I'll be watching these episodes for years to come.",1210636800,25,409,4.54054054054054
3148440,5,B0015XWU9A,This is a great family series.  I have a wide age range of children and all of them love the show!,1502236800,,98,3.6666666666666665
3148441,4,B0015XWU9A,"Season 8 is one of my favorite seasons. It has a lot of good episodes with all kinds of life lessons. It especially gets intense by the end of the season and series. Yep, Season 8 is good. But there is one problem with this season: Jonathan Taylor Thomas' departure. I don't like it how Jonathan Taylor Thomas left the show in this season. He is one of my favorite actors on the show. It's just not the same without him. I especially don't like how he didn't appear in the series finale. It doesn't show what happens to Randy next. Oh well. At least he appeared in a few episodes of this season. Because it would have been even worse if he didn't appear at all in this season. So, that's my review for this season.",1502064000,,714,4.218978102189781
3148442,5,B0015XWU9A,"I might be biased because I knew one of the creators. But Home Improvement is one of the best sitcoms ever to air. The Taylors, Al, and Wilson are always funny in real life situations. I highly recommend ALL of the Home Improvement episodes.",1500508800,,241,4.5

3148444,1,B0015XWU9A,"The 2nd DVD would not load, so I could not watch it. Because the ""return window"" has closed, I paid for a faulty DVD. It takes time for a person to view a seaon's worth of videos when they are not a couch potato, so the ""return window"" is ridiculous. If the DVDs are manufactured incorrectly, I should get an exchange!!",1492819200,,319,4.245901639344262

3148473,3,B0015XWU9A,"The Shark has been jumped as they say, while this season is good and the finale is very moving it doesn't have the charm season 1-5 had and in a way was lost by the end of season 6. Tim is still Tim. JTT leaves 4 episodes in creating a giant vaccum that was never filled....oh ABC tried by making Heidi's charcter more included but honestly besides her looks (which as a 13+ male isn't a bad thing) but JTT was the main drive the glue for them all. As Tim Allen said in an interview years later it was time for it to end all the storylines had wrapped up and the fence had come down. Worth purchasing to complete the collection.",1439596800,,628,4.1138211382113825

3148531,3,B0015XWU9A,I love this show but this is where the show got bad. I hated that Randy left he was my favorite. Marty and his kids were annoying. Plots for Tots was the worst episode ever. The show was just not the same anymore. Every other season is great but season was not. I almost gave it a lower rating but there were a few good things about this season but not that much. I don't think I would buy it and anyway at some I'll be able to see it all on Youtube so everything works out fine.,1281744000,,479,3.8979591836734695
3148532,5,B0015XWU9A,This show always found me a way to continue laughing all the way to season 8. I recommend this TV show to everyone who enjoys watching comedy with a family involved.,1278806400,,165,4.354838709677419

3148534,5,B0015XWU9A,"How very pleasant to be reminded of all those excellent reasons for watching Tim Allen's ""Home Improvement"" series, of which this collection was the final season. Among said good reasons are to appreciate rather witty, character-focused writing, a focus on an intact, affectionate and reasonably well-adjusted family, the occasional hilarious physical pratfall... and I always rather liked the clever scene transitions. They were small, throw-away bits, but still. It said worlds about this show that such care and creativity were taken with such a relatively minor detail.
Having said that, it was also a little jarring to see how much the boys had grown, from season one to season eight; but of course it was eight years. The bright eleven-year old and the father-adoring pre-schooler will have become respectively a college-freshman and a middle-school student by the end of it all. And I think they had worked out every possible and impossible means of hiding half of neighbor Wilson's face under every circumstance. But not Tim the Toolman's ability to demolish household appliances and gadgets of every description; that, like Wily Coyote's genius for creative destruction, was a well that never went dry, as proved in the bonus feature ""The Home Improvement Users' Guide"".  One sequence of that reunion special featured a series of exploding BBQ grills, souped-up dishwashers and revolving Christmas trees throwing off sparks and clouds of smoke... it was so hilarious we played it back a couple of times, laughing ourselves to tears each time. All in all, a series which has stood up very well, especially in comparison to the current crop of situation comedies on the broadcast networks.",1237680000,,1696,5.212454212454213

True some of the episodes were kind of pointless but there has never been a series that was absolutely perfect.  In any case, this was a big step up from the previous season.  You almost don't want to watch the last season because you don't want to see it end.  One thing you will be extremely disappointed in is the bonus features.  The reunion special is nothing more than Tim, Al, Heidi, and one guy from K & B.  I wanted to see a documentary on Home Improvement.  Some of the episodes are really sad.  I'm not going to spoil it for you.  Every show needs and has its fair share of sadness and this show is no exception.  Have fun with this season.  I know I did.  I hope you enjoy it as well.",1222300800,,777,4.072847682119205

I really can't put into words how much this show had an impact on my life.  We would watch it as a family.  Recorded every episode on VHS, (yes VHS we didn't have TiVo)  I would try to watcha few episodes every niht before I went to bed.

The final season, as most have said, was not the best season but had some of the most touching episodes.  The show in general is amazing.  Any family wanting to grow closer together should most certainly take some time out and watch a season or two of this show.",1220659200,,658,4.0

3148546,5,B0015XWU9A,I have all the seasons of Home Improvement and was very sad to see it go. It was even more sad when Jonathan Taylor Thomas as Randy Taylor lefted the show. Glad he came back for 1 more eps and then for the 1st time in 8 years seeing Walson's face. Now when I want a good laugh I just grap a dvd and put it in. I am happy and sad at the same time.,1215561600,,346,3.5657894736842106

I agree that some of the episodes were not as funny but it does not matter, all the bonus materials make up for this.",1214265600,,404,3.6551724137931036
3382931,5,B0015XWU9A,"All I can say is well done; Buena Vista Home Entertainment. They really did justice to this series; by adding extras to the DVD sets and this volume is no different. It has blooper reels; and also includes the ""Backstage Pass"" episode that ran right after the series finale on ABC. I remember this because it showed Wilson's (Earl Hindman) entire face in the cast introductions after the series finale ended. During the series run in the cast intro's in front of the studio audience; Wilson would come out holding a small prop of a fence on the lower part of his face and as everyone knows this was a running gag throughout the series.

It also includes the 2003 special; ""Tim Allen Presents: A Users Guide to Home Improvement"". I think I saw this on PBS a few years ago. It Has Tim, Al, Heidi and Rock (Casey Sander) in front of a live studio audience. Earl Hindman (Wilson) narrates the show; but is not seen except in film footage played throughout the show. It's live action and footage of funny moments throughout the series. But it's nice that they included it in this DVD set.

So if you are looking for family oriented entertainment and have not bought this yet; go ahead and do so; it's a great set and a nice way to end this wonderful series. I wish there were more shows on TV just like this one.",1214092800,7,1307,4.396694214876033
3382932,4,B0015XWU9A,"I've watched the season finale twice today. It's hard to believe that it's been nearly nine years since this show ended. I raised my kids on Home Improvement. It was a great family time show--not like the crap that airs on free t.v. today. There were family values, lots of laughter, and healthy relationships. It was about building bonds, building strong character, and laughter--lots of laughter. In season 8, what made Home Improvement so special doesn't always come across but there are several great episodes in this season, the finale being one of them.",1213833600,9,559,4.957446808510638

He is one of my favorite actors on the show. It's just not the same without him. I especially don't like how he didn't appear in the series finale. It doesn't show what happens to Randy next.

The show was just not the same anymore. Every other season is great but season was not. I almost gave it a lower rating but there were a few good things about this season but not that much.

3383031,5,B0015XWU9A,"How very pleasant to be reminded of all those excellent reasons for watching Tim Allen's ""Home Improvement"" series, of which this collection was the final season. Among said good reasons are to appreciate rather witty, character-focused writing, a focus on an intact, affectionate and reasonably well-adjusted family, the occasional hilarious physical pratfall... and I always rather liked the clever scene transitions. They were small, throw-away bits, but still. It said worlds about this show that such care and creativity were taken with such a relatively minor detail.
Having said that, it was also a little jarring to see how much the boys had grown, from season one to season eight; but of course it was eight years. The bright eleven-year old and the father-adoring pre-schooler will have become respectively a college-freshman and a middle-school student by the end of it all. And I think they had worked out every possible and impossible means of hiding half of neighbor Wilson's face under every circumstance. But not Tim the Toolman's ability to demolish household appliances and gadgets of every description; that, like Wily Coyote's genius for creative destruction, was a well that never went dry, as proved in the bonus feature ""The Home Improvement Users' Guide"".  One sequence of that reunion special featured a series of exploding BBQ grills, souped-up dishwashers and revolving Christmas trees throwing off sparks and clouds of smoke... it was so hilarious we played it back a couple of times, laughing ourselves to tears each time. All in all, a series which has stood up very well, especially in comparison to the current crop of situation comedies on the broadcast networks.",1237680000,,1696,5.212454212454213

True some of the episodes were kind of pointless but there has never been a series that was absolutely perfect.  In any case, this was a big step up from the previous season.  You almost don't want to watch the last season because you don't want to see it end.  One thing you will be extremely disappointed in is the bonus features.  The reunion special is nothing more than Tim, Al, Heidi, and one guy from K & B.  I wanted to see a documentary on Home Improvement.  Some of the episodes are really sad.  I'm not going to spoil it for you.  Every show needs and has its fair share of sadness and this show is no exception.  Have fun with this season.  I know I did.

I really can't put into words how much this show had an impact on my life.  We would watch it as a family.  Recorded every episode on VHS, (yes VHS we didn't have TiVo)  I would try to watcha few episodes every niht before I went to bed.

The final season, as most have said, was not the best season but had some of the most touching episodes.  The show in general is amazing.  Any family wanting to grow closer together should most certainly take some time out and watch a season or two of this show.",1220659200,,658,4.0

However, that is not the case with Home Improvement. I was a child of the 90's but never really watched these. Even after over 20 years have gone by, I still find these hilarious. Both my husband and I literally laugh out laugh at least once during each episode. I will say though, some of the episodes aren't family friendly. The jokes may be above your children's heads though. Plus, it's mild compared to what is on most shows nowadays. I'm conservative when it comes to what I think kids should watch, so I would say 10 and above.",1508803200,,664,4.40650406504065
