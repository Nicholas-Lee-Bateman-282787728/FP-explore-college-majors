7125481,5,B00W69F2LK,"The Blu-Ray transfer is nothing short of stunning, highlighting Caleb Deschanels masterful cinematography. There is a wonderfully warm, filmic look that has been preserved, here.

There is a collection of Short Films that director Carroll Ballard made before The Black Stallion. Pigs! (1965) is an 11-minute documentary about pigs on a farm. The Perils of Priscilla (1969) is a 17-minute film about a cat that escapes from its home and survives on the streets of Los Angeles. Rodeo (1969) is a 20-minute doc. about champion bull rider Larry Mahan. Seems Like Only Yesterday (1971) is a 47-minute doc. that features interviews with 12 centenarians as they recount how L.A. has changed over the years. Finally, Crystallization (1974) is an 11-minute educational film shot through a microscope about the patterns created through the formation of crystals.

Carroll Ballard and Scott Foundas features the film critic talking to the director briefly about his early life and how he got into film. From there, he talks about cutting his teeth on educational and industrial films. Ballard says that he was in bad financial shape when he got a call from Francis Ford Coppola, an old classmate, who wanted to work with him. Used to working with small crews and very little money, he was terrified working on a large scale and was almost fired from the project. Ballard recounts several fascinating filming anecdotes on this wonderful extra.

Caleb Deschanel is interviewed and talks about working with Ballard and the mans working methods. He recounts his experiences working on The Black Stallion including how they found certain locations and working with a Canadian crew vs. an Italian crew. He talks about the challenges of working with animals and children.

Still photographer Mary Ellen Mark talks about her experience photographing the cast and crew on location in Toronto and Sardinia. She shares her views on many of the photos she shot and her impressions of Mickey Rooney and Kelly Reno.

Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",1437955200,9,2031,5.123867069486405
7125482,5,B00W69F2LK,"""The Black Stallion"" is a poetic work of art, a moving story both gentle and exciting, and a feast for the eyes and ears that has finally gotten the 4K digital restoration and sumptuous Blu-ray treatment it deserves. It will surprise no one that the fine folks at the Criterion Collection are behind it. This 1979 production is a must-see for lovers of both cinema and animals. It was adapted from Walter Farley's 1941 novel for children, directed by Carroll Ballard in his feature debut, and executive produced by Francis Ford Coppola, who was a classmate of Ballard's at UCLA.

You will cherish this tale of a boy (played by Kelly Reno) and a jet-black Arabian stallion who survive a wild storm and shipwreck, are rescued from an uninhabited island, and are trained by a surrogate father (Mickey Rooney) to become a championship racing team. Some of the most powerful moments and breathtaking natural sequences occur on the island as the boy and his horse become lifelong friends, but the racing scenes are undeniably thrilling and rewarding as well.

These images were captured by cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, who supervised the gorgeous restoration. Thousands of imperfections were removed to create the cleanest picture possible, and the colors pop, though there remains noticeable grain from the original film print. Along with Rooney, Robert Dalva was nominated for an Oscar for his perfectly paced editing. The lush, mesmerizing musical score was composed by Carmine Coppola, the producer's father. Of course the soundtrack has been remastered for crystal clarity.

Numerous extras accompany this release, including five short documentary films by Carroll Ballard, with introductions by the filmmaker. The shorts were produced in the 1960s and 1970s, range from 11 to 47 minutes, and cover a variety of topics: pigs, a house cat, a bull rider, centenarians, and crystals. While interesting, I don't consider them essential. Also included are an insightful 47-minute conversation between Ballard and film critic Scott Foundas, a 21-minute interview with Deschanel, and a 7-minute feature in which Mary Ellen Mark talks about her on-set photographs. The original theatrical trailer, an essay by film critic Michael Sragow, and a 17-by-11-inch color poster round out the presentation.

Interviews with the actors would have been appreciated, but are completely absent. Of course Rooney, whose epic career of nearly 90 years included the classic film ""National Velvet,"" and Hoyt Axton, the country music great who played Reno's father, are no longer with us, but Reno himself, who had only a brief movie career, and Teri Garr, who played his mother, could have participated. Minor shortcomings aside, the glory of the film is indisputable. I give this new Criterion box my highest recommendation.",1436832000,21,2804,5.266219239373601

The Black Stallionat least the 1979 adaptation that Francis Ford Coppola presentsis an interesting hybrid. Its part family movie and part indie/art house film. Director Carroll Ballard takes the 1941 book for young readers and infuses the story of a boy and a wild horse who save each other with indie film sensibilities and art-house cinematography.

The result is a film thats obviously made for adults but suitable for children. There are a few less warm fuzzies and sappy moments in this hybrid (a good thing!), though the pacing in the first act might seem a bit too leisurely for the youngest viewers. Theres not much you can do for them except to assure them that the action picks up, but older children who squirm can be shown the luxurious cinematography from Caleb Deschanel (Zooey Deschanels father), with breathlessly original shots and angles and the space for those shots to breathe and expand in our consciousness.

BlackStallionscreen1Ballard isn't quite as lavish with his plotting and narrative. Some directors like to show rather than tell; Ballard likes to suggest rather than show. We see a young boy and his father on a steamer off the coast of North Africa, where Dad (Hoyt Axton) is gambling with dangerous-looking people, and the boy, Alec (Kelly Reno), has the run of the ship. The boy glimpses a wild black stallion roped and whipped by Arab trainers and forced into one of the ships holds. Feeling sorry for the horse, Alec returns with sugar cubes he swiped but is caught and treated almost as roughly by the Arab. Shortly thereafter, his father shares with him a trinket from his poker winnings: a small statuette of Alexander the Greats horse. We hear the story of how the horse was so wild the king was going to put him down, but conceded that the boy Alexander could keep him if he could ride him. Of course, that tiny statuette and story become a controlling metaphor for the narrative of The Black Stallion, for soon afterwards a violent storm kicks up, the boy releases the horse so he won't go down with the ship, and after watching him leap into the sea the boy is thrown overboard and calls for help.

So begins a relationship between the boy and the horse that develops on the island until hes rescued by a group of men who also take the animal that Alec refuses to leave behind. And yet, what Alec does leave behind is any apparent feeling for his father. We really don't know what happened to the man, nor did we see any emotional reaction in Alec after he awakens on the beach of a desert island. Hes as concerned about what happened to his father as he is about finding fresh drinking water (a detail thats never addressed). We aren't told, as readers of the book were, that the two of them had been visiting an uncle in India, so viewers really have no idea why the pair was on a ship so far from his home somewhere in the states where horses are raced. Even after Alec returns home to his mother (Terri Garr), we aren't given much in the way of information.

BlackStallionscreen2But this is an impressionistic film, one that is more image-driven and scene-driven than it is dependent on plot, especially in the early going. For a while, its like Cast Away, but with a horse instead of a volleyball. Then turns into National Velvet, but with a teenage boy instead of a teenage girl, and a thoroughbred horse race rather than steeplechase. Perhaps not coincidentally, just as actor Mickey Rooney played the role of the former jockey and mentor in National Velvet who helps young Velvet train for the steeplechase, hes a former jockey and mentor here too, helping Alec to learn what it takes to harness all that wild energy and race Black, as hes simply called.

The payoff will ultimately satisfy young viewers if they can make it through the slower parts. But frankly, it wouldnt hurt todays children to learn how to appreciate those slow-down moments in lifeespecially when they're so beautifully filmed.

If you're building a Blu-ray collection, by all means, add this title. But the master had a lot of grain that carries over onto the HD release, so this title would probably look just as good on DVD. As for the bonus features, they're geared for adultsthough older, curious young filmmakers-in-waiting might be drawn to several of the five short films by Ballard, especially one on the Rodeo and another in which Ballard interviewed centenarians talking about what L.A. was like a hundred years ago . . . juxtaposed against the chaos of images that flood 1971 Los Angeles. What he does will inspire young filmmakers, who will find a way to take the best of what he does and speed it up for the current time and generation.

Language: Clean as can be
Sex: Same here
Violence: That brief boat beat-down, a violent storm, and a cobra incident
Adult situations: Loss of the father
Takeaway: It IS possible to have it both ways, to craft a film thats aesthetically pleasing out of a story intended for a young audience.",1435795200,15,5209,4.696604600219058
7125484,5,B00W69F2LK,My grandson loves this film. Excellent copy! Good price!,1475193600,,56,5.333333333333333
7125485,3,B00W69F2LK,"I was expecting so much more than this with the new Criterion 4k transfer. I had this on pre-order for 2 months, eagerly awaiting its arrival. I raced home when I saw it had been delivered and planned my evening around watching it.

Parts of the film look great, but the grain in other areas is horrible--particularly the first 30 minutes. The cinematography of this film is one of the primary reasons to watch it. It was bad enough that it detracted from my experience. I have always loved Criterion's releases and they normally look amazing. The sound is as good as you can expect and the extras are fabulous. If you love the film, the extras alone justify the purchase.

Here is my justification for the rating: if this were a standard release, I would give it 5 stars, but this is a Criterion 4k! I expect to be blown away. I know the problem lies in the master copy and Criterion did what they could to fix it, but it just wasn't stunning like I expected. It may be truer to the original, but I think some sensible correction may have helped in this case. This is still the best version of the film in existence, but that's not saying much considering the previous versions. I absolutely love Criterion and will continue to buy just about everything they produce. This one just did not live up to my expectations.",1471392000,2,1318,4.464730290456432

7125487,5,B00W69F2LK,Spectacular film. Thought maybe I wouldn't enjoy it as an adult. Not the case.,1464912000,,78,4.642857142857143
7125488,1,B00W69F2LK,Bought this as a gift.  Granted I bought it early because I purchased it when I found out my niece wanted to see it and held onto it for about a month and a half.  When I gave it to her the first 15 minutes or so of the movie worked great and we settled in to watch it.  Then it went to a black screen and that was it.  Couldn't get the disc to work.  Since I bought it early and held onto it I can not get a replacement.  So let that be a lesson for everyone.  If you want to buy a gift outside of the holiday season time it just right so you can make sure it actually works.  Now I have a niece who still wants to see this movie and will have to track it down elsewhere.,1460764800,,672,3.6503496503496504
7125489,5,B00W69F2LK,"One of the greatest movies made in the 1980's, now at long last in 4K and Criterion Collection release. Jaw ""droppingly"" beautiful from start to wild finish. One of Mickey Rooney's greatest roles, a breakout performance by Kelly Reno as young Alec and a screenplay that understands how to tell a story with minimal, and only the most essential, dialog. The rest is left to the masterwork of Director Carrol Ballard and the cinematography Caleb Deschanel who work a magic that will stay with you long after the final credits roll.",1457136000,,529,4.824175824175824
7125490,5,B00W69F2LK,"A classic story finally given it's due.  Video is as good as it's going to get.  Much better shadow detail then previous releases.  There is film grain but it is present in original source.  This is done right, cleaned up the picture without over processing it.  Audio is clean but original wasn't in surround so you get what was originally intended.",1453248000,,350,4.672131147540983
7125491,5,B00W69F2LK,"Ive long said that this movie is the best G rated live-action movie Ive ever seen.  And if it wasn't for Toy Story and a couple other animated films, the best of any genre.  It is one of those movies I want to have everyone watch, and one I can watch any time.  So when Criterion announced they had applied their magic to the film, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  The story is simple and hasn't much of a script.  Twelve year old Alec Ramsey (Kelly Reno) is cruising off the coast of Africa with his father (Hoyt Axton).  While old dad is playing cards, young Alec encounters a huge black stallion, likely being shipped for racing.  A violent storm is about to sink the ship, but the horse jumps in and the boy is tossed in right behind him.  Somehow the horse makes it to a secluding island (shot on Sardinia), with Alec hanging on to a rope attached to the horse.

Director Carroll Ballard and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, both working on their first feature film, create one of the most beautiful first hours in cinema history.  Silent except for the natural environment of the island and Carmine Coppolas engaging score, the story slowly comes together with Alec and The Black becoming close friends.  Deschanel takes his camera under shallow water to capture the prancing legs of the boy and the horse.  It is here, Alec first climbs aboard and gets the ride of his life.  The idyllic scenes eventually end when the pair are rescued by Italian fishermen.

Back home (shot mostly in Ontario, Canada), the horse outgrows the back yard of Alecs mom (Teri Garr).  Startled by garbage collectors, the horse runs off through town and is eventually corralled by a former jockey and trainer, Henry Dailey (Mickey Rooney).  The story becomes more commonplace as the horse is fast, the boy is the best one to ride him and wouldnt you know a match race is on the horizon.  The story is saved from falling off the cliff thanks to some brilliant directing showing the horse in an early morning rainstorm to impress one of racings top journalists.  Rooney has the role of a lifetime.  Hes perfect, earning an Oscar nomination.  This is a beautiful movie to watch.  A masterpiece guided to daylight thanks to producer Francis Ford Coppola.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray transfer is excellent as you would expect.  With a 1080p video resolution, the film is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Colors, hues, black levels are all superb.  I did think that the grain levels could have been toned down a bit.  Occasionally they were just a bit too evident.  Contrast and detail are excellent, both in close ups and the gorgeous distant shots.  Here is what is provided by Criterion:

""Supervised by director of photography Caleb Deschanel, this new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution on a Scanity film scanner from the 35mm original camera negative; the film was then restored in 2K resolution. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS, while Digital Vision's Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, noise management, flicker, and jitter.
The original 2.0 surround soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the 35mm original Dolby A magnetic tracks. Clicks, thumps, hiss, hum, and crackle were manually removed using Pro Tools HD, AudioCube's integrated workstation, and iZotope RX 4. Please be sure to enable Dolby Pro Logic decoding on your receiver to properly play the Dolby 2.0 surround soundtrack.
Transfer supervisors: Caleb Deschanel, Lee Kline.
Colorist: Dave Cole/Modern VideoFilm, Los Angeles.""

The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 as noted above so be sure to use your Dolby Pro Logic to bet the best surround effect.  Although it isn't available in a dedicated surround option, I really cant complain.  There is an English SDH option.  Everything is crystal clear including quiet noise and ambient effects.  Note the film won an Oscar for sound editing.  Here are the extras:

 Five short films by Carroll Ballard, with introductions by the director: Pigs! (1965), The Perils of Priscilla (1969), Rodeo (1969), Seems Like Only Yesterday (1971), and Crystallization (1974)

7125494,5,B00W69F2LK,"Time has perhaps taken a tiny tick off the perfection of this for me (the ending is a bit abrupt, etc.), but basically this is still one of the best, most beautiful, most emotional, and most entertaining family films ever made.

Eschewing dialogue for large blocks of time, and then only using words sparingly, this is truly a story told in pictures; breathtaking wide shots (often tracking so fast, but so smoothly that it seems impossible) and intimate close-ups revealing subtle details of emotion.  The sequence with boy and horse making friends while trapped on an island is justifiably what people remember most, but theres lots thats great here, including what was probably the best performance of Mickey Rooneys long career.

And the Criterion transfer finally does justice for what was one of the best looking films of all time.  The DVDs were all downright awful.  The US version wasn't even widescreen enhanced. The 1st long awaited blu-ray was certainly a huge step up, but Criterion have really nailed it here, making this what is likely to be the definitive version for quite some time.  If you've never seen it, or love it and own anything less than this version, it's a very worthwhile investment.",1446940800,4,1213,4.892682926829268
