I was able to view the disk by going into the episodes, only to discover that Episode 5 is missing entirely (disk 3 overlaps with disk 2). This is obviously a manufacturing defect. Anyone else encounter the same problem?
  That said, the remaining episodes are superb, the best yet in MI-5/Spooks series.",1200096000,9,397,4.642857142857143
3102798,1,B0013BDQ42,"I check the Internet almost weekly for possible releases of MI-5.  So I was thrilled to see Volume 5 available.  After thoroughly enjoying the first four episodes from Season 5, I happily inserted Disk #3 into my DVD player.  In return, I got a continuous looping from the FBI warning to the BBC logo, then back again.  Same deal on another DVD player as well as on my computer.  It simply doesn't work.

I will give credit to Amazon for a quick resolution; a replacement is on its way as I write.  I'm just hoping that there's nothing wrong with the manufacture of Disk 3 in general.  Given that possibility I just thought I'd post this.",1200096000,9,638,4.439655172413793
3102799,5,B0013BDQ42,"Season Five of the fantastic MI-5, aka Spooks, remains the finest thriller drama on tv today.  It continues to draw from the headlines of today's CNN/BBC News formats with thoroughly believable storylines addressing intra-government power struggles, African nationalism, fanatical terrorist, religious fundamentalism, and espionage that is pitch perfect. The superior ensemble cast alas, is whittled down from the original team, loosing long-time computer/techno geek Rory MacGregor and the lovely and loyal Ruth Evershed.  All that remains of the original crew is in command, staid Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) whose bittersweet office romance with Ruth is shafted as it falters.  Widower Adam Carter (Rupert Penry-Jones) is at studly top form showing off both his weakened single state to the young nanny as well as a nice backside, but his travails strain both mental and physical talents as Adam must lead his new team into the fray.  The addition of a new team member Ros Myers adds ying to Adam's yang and their clashes are both head to head and more so.

If any series is to be owned, MI-5 is the one to own.  It is simply, the extreme best as BBC productions have the reputation of upholding and with this series, they surpass.",1199577600,3,1233,5.0492610837438425
3102800,5,B0013BDQ42,"It's hard to believe that a series can survive the demise or departure of not one, or two, but three of the original characters -- Tom, Zoe, and Danny. All 3 were totally believable, sympathetic characters, portrayed by fantastic actors.

Well, the series has not lost anything... in fact, it's gotten even better. Maybe I've become more used to the idea that ""spooks"" come and go, but the institution lives on.

Contrasted with ""24"" and the Jack Bauer character -- both of which I think are also brilliant -- I'd have to say that while MI-5 keeps growing, 24 would fall apart if Jack were to die suddenly.

There wasn't any major effort to integrate the new characters in MI-5, and their back-stories were brief; but it just worked. This is a great show about the cold, harsh reality of global politics and terrorism today, and the extraordinary effort and sacrifices required by security officers to protect us.

Fantastic stuff. Can't wait to get into Series 5.",1199404800,2,964,4.754491017964072
3102801,5,B0013BDQ42,"I'm glad to see that series 5 is being released soon.  Due to financial reasons (couldn't afford cable and pay other bills) I have not seen series 4 or 5.  I am in a better money position now and am planning to catch up what I've missed with these dvd sets.  One huge advantage to having the dvds is that you get the whole episode as it was shown in the UK.  A&E and BBCAmerica edit the episodes down by about 10-12 mins to fit the American tv format (commercials). During the editing process, some of the action/back story that happens is cut and it leaves you wondering why a character acts or does something a certain way.  Now I'll be able to see the whole episode as originally edited and shown.",1198454400,8,700,4.2727272727272725

3102803,5,B0013BDQ42,"I think this series is one of the best on television.  I've enjoyed 1 - 4 and can't wait for Volume 5.  I wish BBC America would get rid off the garbage they show and replace it with current versions of the better stuff they show back in the UK.

Good season, but I - IV were better.  The anti-British, -America, -Israeli and -Christian story lines got a little hard to stomach after awhile.

I came to Amazon this morning to buy the fifth volume but read the reviews and am put off by the disk problems. So, as I have three small, multi-region DVD players, I went over to Amazon.uk and bought it, though in the UK, the series is ""Spooks"". I figure even with the exchange it's still cheaper and I can be fairly sure there will be no missing episodes. I completely recommend this show to anyone interested in this type of programming. As good as ""24"" is, ""MI-5"" (aka ""Spooks""), blows it away and that's saying something. If you're new to MI-5, begin with volume one. Each episode is a complete story but in other ways, each episode is dependant on the ones before. If you start in the middle, you'll be confused. As it's made by the Brits, they assume we're intelligent adults and treat us accordingly.",1438992000,,947,4.448275862068965
3102821,4,B0013BDQ42,"I had the same problem as most of the other reviewers in that I am one episode short but with another episode duplicated.

I have to say that other than that I think that the BBC have done an awfully good job in pushing this show back to the dizzy heights of the first season. You are always surprised by the loss of characters which happens at unforseen times but the new ones are often rough diamonds which soon are polished especially the new character of Rosone to watch there. Can we trust her? Is she as honest as she says? Time alone will tell.

There are some really solid storylines here, stellar performances and far far too many realistic scenarios especially in the last episode.

I am not surprised A&E have chosen not to broadcast this season, they are probably too scared of all of the issues that might arise from groups who could take offence and some of the powerful political lobby groups in the States.

3102838,5,B0013BDQ42,"I am obsess with this program. I first learned of this intriguing show by watching the previews on the first, Torchwood season 1 disc. So I then went down to my public library and started searching on their database to see if they may carry this disc, and yes they did have a few of seasons. Volume 5 was not release on disc yet, in the States. Season 3 was my first take on this program and then I was hook. In my city we once had a Virgin Mega store and where I purchase my torchwood first volume, but for some reason that store did not sell none of these MI-5 programs. I then ask the clerks if and why not the store don't have this program. And if the Store can order the disc and they said at the time that those disc are really expensive, and will not carry those shows, and yet they had other British, Foreign and other Obscure films that was more expensive in there collection. I saw that my local library got Volume-5 on their shelves so I grab and watch and love this show. When I was able to purchase for my own collection I notice that in Volume-3 and 5. Because I watch disc season 1 through 6 from the library that in volume-3 that the character Zoe had to go to the Mental institution and was pump with so much drugs that she was never the same nor that character returned. In my personnel collection that same character came back from her nervous condition and started a family and was able to move on from MI-5. I own volume-3,5-10. When I came across Volume-5 I purchase at a local music store a few years back my disc 3 is blank also and that the best episode ever! I was so devastated because I remember that the character call Ruth had to leave or walk away from MI-5. I don't want to spoiled want happen to those devoted fans out there, but I be leaved that The BBC America programs are slightly alter because the British shows ten to be a little bit involved , and you have to really pay attention.",1385424000,,1921,4.180592991913747

3102843,5,B0013BDQ42,"Until mid way through season 5, I became an avid Spooks fan.  What a great show--well acted (no heavy British dialects making us Yanks wish for subtitles) with exciting stories, believable characters in current events context.  Except for Harry (think ""M"") the main characters come in and out (often by death unfortunately) from season to season.  I miss the characters I grow used to, but the replacements are just as intriguing.

As a Prime customer, all was good until a few weeks ago as the MI-5 series was included for free.  Then, out of the blue, it was dropped from free streaming.  The official word from customer service was ""Shows and movies available in our Prime instant video service may change from time to time depending on our agreements with content owners.""  But if I were cynical, I would say it was a strategy to get the customer hooked and then start charging.

Regardless, that was a great disappointment.  As much as I loved the series, I can't bring myself to paying 2 bucks a show to continue as there are quite a lot of shows to go.  Alas!",1364083200,,1066,4.592592592592593

3102858,5,B0013BDQ42,"Now in its fifth season, MI-5 continues to retains its seemingly impossible-to-achieve status as one of the smartest, most intelligent, and most dramatic shows you'll ever see. ""MI-5,"" a domestic intelligence service composed of a group of British citizen individuals who join ""5"" to help ""defend the realm,"" is set apart from the external security service, ""MI-6,"" which focus more on international and extra-national concerns that may impact the security of the UK. Under its mandate, MI-5 deals with economic, terrorist, civil uprisings, or even any externally originating threat that has found its way back to the UK. The series introduces us to all kinds of real-world threats--both potential and operationally in motion--and shows how the members of ""5"" must react in order to counter and/or eliminate these threats. The series is so well written, produced, directed, filmed, and acted that each episode is more of a 60-minute movie than a television episode. The drama, intrigue, intelligent stories, and, yes, action, establish the series as a standout among even the often high-achieving BBC (already the producer of many world-class shows), making it with little doubt one of the best shows of this nature ever made.

Season Five maintains, and in some ways, surpasses the drama of the previous seasons by opening up an entirely new line of threat to the country which involves both organizational and personal ""baggage"" from members of both ""5"" and ""6."" As is the case in a number of the later seasons (particularly seasons 5 - 9), the story line weaves an intricate and complex path throughout the episodes, making it requisite that one watch these in order to receive maximum impact and understanding. But I must admit incredulity that the show could surpass the amazing job it has already done in the previous four seasons. I liken the show to one of those plate twirlers who gets a plate spinning up in the air at the top of one of those skinny sticks, and while you are trying to understand how he is doing it, starts another plate stirring on a second stick while keeping the first going. And then, to your incredulity, he adds yet a third plate on a third stick, and now maintains all three plates. You scratch your head with amazement even as you watch him keep all three plates twirling on those sticks, and yet he does it right in front of you. Yet the Fifth Season of MI-5 is just like that: there appears to be no limits to the manner in which the show can continue to exceed itself.

Again, because of the complexity and the intellectual development of characters (as well as the plots themselves), it is best to watch MI-5 in order by both season and episode, with no skipping of episodes, and this makes the DVD release of the show perhaps the very best manner in which to view the production. The DVDs allow you to step your way through each season, episode by episode, thereby viewing the show in the manner in which it was intended to be viewed. This gives you the ability to watch how characters are developed, and to better gain an understanding of how the MI-5 Section D group works. With the exception of the very first episode of Season One (the first episode is really not up to the standards of all the remaining ones, an issue attributable to the difficulties inherent in plot development) the shows are incredibly exciting, but also intelligently written in a way that will make you re-think the issues surrounding the role of the security forces in countries, what actions should and should not be allowed, the best way to address classes of threats, the implications for a free society when eliminating threats, the intersection of political and security concerns, and much more. You might at first glace think that MI-5, as an entertainment production, would be no more than that; but MI-5 is certainly more than a simple entertainment show. Be prepared to be entertained, but also mentally stimulated.

This is a truly amazing show. It's easily seven stars out of five. And the prices of the discs have come down dramatically from earlier years. But don't forget: you need to watch these in order, starting with Season One. If you haven't seen it yet, start with Season One, work your way through that first not-so-good episode, and then watch the thing take of a like a jet. You'll be hooked by the time you get to the end of the first season, and the second set won't arrive at your doorstep quickly enough.",1325635200,6,4451,4.770428015564202

Season Five maintains, and in some ways, surpasses the drama of the previous seasons by opening up an entirely new line of threat to the country which involves both organizational and personal ""baggage"" from members of both ""5"" and ""6."" As is the case in a number of the later seasons (particularly seasons 5 - 9), the story line weaves an intricate and complex path throughout the episodes, making it requisite that one watch these in order to receive maximum impact and understanding. But I must admit incredulity that the show could surpass the amazing job it has already done in the previous four seasons. I liken the show to one of those plate twirlers who gets a plate spinning up in the air at the top of one of those skinny sticks, and while you are trying to understand how he is doing it, starts another plate stirring on a second stick while keeping the first going. And then, to your incredulity, he adds yet a third plate on a third stick, and now maintains all three plates. You scratch your head with amazement even as you watch him keep all three plates twirling on those sticks, and yet he does it right in front of you. Yet the Fifth Season of MI-5 is just like that: there appears to be no limits to the manner in which the show can continue to exceed itself.

Again, because of the complexity and the intellectual development of characters (as well as the plots themselves), it is best to watch MI-5 in order by both season and episode, with no skipping of episodes, and this makes the DVD release of the show perhaps the very best manner in which to view the production. The DVDs allow you to step your way through each season, episode by episode, thereby viewing the show in the manner in which it was intended to be viewed. This gives you the ability to watch how characters are developed, and to better gain an understanding of how the MI-5 Section D group works. With the exception of the very first episode of Season One (the first episode is really not up to the standards of all the remaining ones, an issue attributable to the difficulties inherent in plot development) the shows are incredibly exciting, but also intelligently written in a way that will make you re-think the issues surrounding the role of the security forces in countries, what actions should and should not be allowed, the best way to address classes of threats, the implications for a free society when eliminating threats, the intersection of political and security concerns, and much more. You might at first glace think that MI-5, as an entertainment production, would be no more than that; but MI-5 is certainly more than a simple entertainment show. Be prepared to be entertained, but also mentally stimulated.

This is a truly amazing show. It's easily seven stars out of five. And the prices of the discs have come down dramatically from earlier years. But don't forget: you need to watch these in order, starting with Season One. If you haven't seen it yet, start with Season One, work your way through that first not-so-good episode, and then watch the thing take of a like a jet. You'll be hooked by the time you get to the end of the first season, and the second set won't arrive at your doorstep quickly enough.

Frankly though, I felt these two episodes at least were way over the top as though the writers were looking for new plot ideas.

3102862,5,B0013BDQ42,"Season five (5) of this fabulous BBC spy thriller really contains some ""tightly"" written wonderfully directed and greatly acted episodes; I was in complete awe at the high quality of Season (5).  There are no ""wasted"" story lines just very ""tight"" thrillers throughout this season that kept me trying (unsuccessfully) to determine which character was indeed on the ""right"" side because especially in Season five (5) one is always surprised who is really ""good"" or who is really ""bad"".  There are no obvious conclusions to each episode--I was always surprised by all of the outcomes in Season five (5).

I very much enjoyed season five (5) of MI--5 and continue to be ""blown away"" by the ""high tech"" gadgetry used by the MI-5 team.  I can hardly wait to view the next season.  I am enthralled with this series.",1323475200,,809,4.7913669064748206

3102864,4,B0013BDQ42,"MI-5 just continues to grab my attention. I was excited about Season 5 to find out what happened to Adam after he was hit by a sniper in last season's cliffhanger. Let's say the cliffhanger is resolved in seconds in the premiere episode. Quickly, MI-5 is back in motion with an emotionally crippled Adam. Adam's lingering psychological problems over his near death experience and the loss of his beloved wife in a botched mission last season become an ongoing threat to the efficiency and safety of MI-5 through the following episodes and his colleagues begin to question his judgement.

I started to feel the show was losing a bit of steam midway through the season. If it's not the Islamic terrorist, it's people pretending to be Islamic terrorists, or various terrorists trying to outdo the Islamic terrorists. One episode did feature Christian terrorists trying to bring Christianity back to ALL of Britain.

One thing that amazes me is how much of actual and real London we see in the series. Threats are to actual known locations in London. I wonder how that feels to a city that has known terrorism for decades. Does it add to the realism or is it giving ideas to the wrong people?

The last episode involved environmental terrorists intent on blowing up the Thames barrier if their demands were not met. It's a good bit of high tense drama that made me curious about what the Thames barrier does. What happened with the Thames before there was the barrier. Could terrorists really gain access to the barrier as they do in the series. The cliffhanger is A+++. There was an obvious way to end the season with an obvious cliffhanger with agents in mortal danger yet there is a complete twist in the plot and it is commendable...a brilliant piece of writing and suspense. The twist is seriously unnerving and frightening but totally believable in the context of the story. Now I have to get Season 6.

There is constant movement in the cast of MI-5. Only a few remain through the series and there is always some shift. Season 5 introduces us to Ros Meyer played by the remarkable Hermionie Norris. I enjoyed her in WIRE IN THE BLOOD but she left part way through the series so I wonder if it was to move to MI-5. We first meet Ros where she seems to be part of her father's plot to bring down the government. So watch and see how she ends up an MI-5 agent. She's cold, heartless and somewhat ruthless at the beginning--not the most loveable of the team and not one to bring in homemade baked goods to share with coworkers. No problem is an innocent person must be sacrificed to save the masses. That is our Ros.

Series 5 delves into the personal life of Adam at the expense of the other agents. I would like to see more of the personal lives of the other agents. How do they lead a duel life with family and friends who think they have normal jobs. Harry and Ruth come close to hooking up and there is a story that I hope will be explored more in the future.

I love MI-5 but it is relies heavily on cliches recycled material. As you watch MI-5, you can always be sure at least one cast member will die during the series. Britain, especially London, is always under threat of a major and devastating terrorist attack. There is always a double agent in MI-5 or the British government feeding information to the ""bad guys"". The MI-5 quickly realizes the terrorist have inside information. MI-5 agents always have to make a potentially disastrous decision to override a superior's direct orders or the directives of the British government. The MI-5 agents always know better. Sometimes the threat involves a member of the government and if his role is discovered, ""it will bring down the government."" You'll had that term more than once or twice. Tiny gadgets and cameras can always keep track of an agent's moment in a threatening situation. They can be warned what threat lays around the corner or where the next exit is. The amazing fact is it all reels us in and it is part of the fun. The MI-5 agents always realize what is really happening but arrive seconds too late to save an innocent victim.

MI-5 is sheer high tech spy fun. It is silly and hokey at times but it all works and it is totally worth the time to enjoy this fantastic series.",1318896000,2,4250,4.54046997389034
3102865,3,B0013BDQ42,MI-5 is an awesome show and its always very gripping! You never know when or who will die suddenly or what will happen next which is why I love watching it. I was vastly disappointed to find out when I opened the case (a year after getting it with a season 1-6 set) that I was missing disk #5 and had 2 disk #3s. Amazingly even though this is the UPC of the defective sets the disk #3s appear to work! I just can't move on to season 6 though without season 5's 5th disk,1315353600,,469,3.9473684210526314

3102868,2,B0013BDQ42,"The MI5 series started as a no-nonsense series with spooks able to deal with all kinds of situations. But as the series continues, and especially in the 5th season, it becomes politically correct to modern standards. Suddenly the officers don't carry arms anymore, or at least very seldom, and the enemies are sought more within the British system than outsides, especially in the Arab and/or Muslim world. There is less violence than in the beginning, and there is more ""let's talk about it"" atmosphere. Very disappointing. But the situation changes if suspected Israeli agents come into play. Suddenly they are the bad guys, suddenly they are more violent than any other counterpart MI5 encountered in the last 4 seasons and suddenly the SAS, when storming an embassy (again) can shoot straight. Of course they shoot the Israelis, even when they are on the ground, numb from an explosion. You wouldn't (and haven't) see this when it comes to Muslim terrorists. But as it's only Israelis, nobody cares.
Oh, and yes, of course, in this seasons more than ever before the Americans are the bad and stupid ones, and the spooks of her Majesty are of course, although outnumbered and out-resourced, the heroes.
Rather cheap and disappointing. Another thing is that after politics economic powers took over: I appreciated the car diversity in this series - Peugeot, Lexus, Renault, Jaguar, LAnd Rover ... all kind of cars. Since season 5 the Volkswagen Group took over, and Harry switches to Audi, Ruth to SEAT, the SAS arrives in a VW van, and even the Israeli ambassador drives a Porsche (which no Israeli ambassador I know would do). It is a pitty. I strongly reconsider buying the following seasons.
So, for all the viewers who would like to see unarmed far-from-reality agents acting politically correct, bashing Americans and Israelis - go and watch MI5. For those who liked the first three seasons - don't continue to season 5. Keep the good memory of the first seasons.",1304640000,,1971,4.921921921921922
3102869,4,B0013BDQ42,"I had no technical issues as did other reviewers. My set-up is streaming over Wi-Fi (N) to a Sony Blu-Ray that supports Amazon On Demand.

I'm uncertain as to why Season five is listed under Prime and charges .99 per episode. As far as I can tell it's the only season that doesn't fall under the package deal.

So about the actual episode. Really great. MI5 has become one of my favorite shows. And this episode is one of the reasons why. Constant introduction of new (and potentially dangerous) characters, plot twists, plots with-in plots. Unexpected deaths. This episode does has it all. Oh and it was a great follow-up to the previous seasons close.

I'm not being specific as I don't want to reveal anything. It would be hard to say much without doing so. I will say that it wouldn't hurt to do a little home-work on Djakarta. I took a look at Wikipedia and searched Naomi Klein's Shock Doctrine - The later proved to be of greater relevance. Come to think of it this episode, and I presume the next, will conclude to be fantastic illustration of the pieces in play in Shock Doctrine. Enjoy.",1303516800,8,1096,4.525252525252525

3102873,3,B0013BDQ42,"MI-5 (Spooks) has been a favorite for years.  The situations are gripping; the characters memorable, each with a unique style and voice that keeps things fresh, particularly through cast changes.  I fear, however, that with each passing series, the show is sliding more and more into implausible sensationalism.  I call this ""ER Syndrome"":  Like MI-5, ER was a wonderful show with with excellent characters & smart writing.  Eventually, ER's producers & writers started to put in the ocassional sensational episode to grab a quick ratings boost.  At first, this was OK.  One could imagine a gunman in an inner-city ER, or a psycho patient attacking a doctor.  However, the producers & writers grew lazy and the show got addicted to the sensational.  It was as if they were afraid that their audience would check out without the catastrophy of the day.  Hence, a parade of bombs, plagues, gun-fire, helicopter accidents, amazing rescues, etc.  The show became a wan characature of itself, ending a 1/2 dozen years past its prime.

I fear that MI-5 is going down this same path.  With Series 5, it seems that every week the team of 1/2 dozen people had to save all of London (or England) from an incredible catastrophy.  I won't go into specifics so as not to spoil anything, but what was once suspenseful and plausible is starting to turn sensationalistic and cheap.

Having said all that, however, MI-5 is still wonderful & certainly better than drama that can be found on US television.  However, measured against itself, MI-5 is not what it was and I fear that, unless changes are made, it will continue to slide down the path toward the inane.",1281312000,3,1646,4.825

They have carried this style of TV drama to the next level. From an American point of view, it is interesting to get another country's point of view on international terrorism.

I confess, and maybe some other Spooks junkies will confess the same, but when I received the series dvd's I watched 10 hours in a row with minor breaks for essentials, finally quitting at 3AM. This series is absolutely knockout. One reviewer wrote being a bit put off by the variety of villains there are in the world coming from all nations with all beleifs. Is it possible? You decide.

3102879,5,B0013BDQ42,"MI-5- the Spooks, the intelligence branch of the British Government has always had a glamorous aspect to it from the American side. Afterall these are the best of the UK.  Following the BBC series brings the reality home to us. Yes, they all carry guns and are faced with danger every day, but there is a lot of daily 'grunt' work involved.

Harry Pearce, played by Peter Firth is the Head of the Counter Terrorism Department.  He is the constant in this seriesl. He is one of the few, so far, that has not been killed off. He is the consummate professional that pulls the team back to reality. He is also ready to give up a member of the team if need be. He is the father of the group and each team member is part of his family.

Adam Carter, played bt Rupert Penny Jones, is the MI-5 Senior Case Leader. He is a formidable character- ready to lead his team into danger to keep the UK free.  He is suffering from PTSD because of his wife's death. It appears from the signals in the series that we should be prepared for Adam's demise. He has had too many close calla. Rupert is the mainstay of this series and he is a fave.

Ros Myers, played by Hermoine Norris is the heroine of the MI-5. Cold, ruthless and beautiful, we know that Ros is lonely and this exterior she portrays has a  great deal of hurt underneath.

Malcom Wynn-Jones, played by Hugh Simon plays the technician and data analyst. He is another mainstay of MI-5. He is the one that provides most of the information needed and is the person who is most responsible for keeping the MI-5 team alive.

The rest of the team, walk in and out of the series. We just get to know them and they are killed in one manner or another. This series is remarkable in that death of a character is as much a part of reality as introducing someone new.

Volume 5 starts with a terrorirst attack on the oil and gas depots. Moves on to the loss of one of the most lovable characters, to an enviornmental group threatening to flood London. Throughout the series, Harry Pearce defends and delivers his MI-5 team to their highest acheievements. This is the series set that deals with terrorism. MI-5 is always current, the events of the world end up in this Spooks series. The United States oftne comes across as devious and deceitful- well, why not, look at our past eight years and our leaders. But the UK takes its own hits and all the thorns seem to come undone. This series also introduced us to the persomal side of the team, and their empotional and family upheavels.

Highly Highly Recommended.  prisrob 02-22-09

3102882,5,B0013BDQ42,"To be fair this is more of a composite review for series 3-5. I tend to agree with the reviewers who felt the series fell flat in series 3 (with the exception of the cliff hanger carried over from series 2). Things start to pick up in series 4 with the series 3 cliff hanger carry over. There is however, one episode where Adam goes under cover as a Syrian (speaking English with an Arab accent) that simply doesn't work.

In an earlier review I commented on how characters fell off the series, with a much greater frequency relative to American television. I have changed my stance and have gotten behind this as a useful maneuver to keep the series fresh.

In summation:

Series 3 = 3*

Series 4 (though the final 2 episodes) = 4*-4 1/2*

Series 5 (including the final episodes of series 4) = 5* along with my personal statement that this is some of the best TV I have ever seen

When you receive this DVD set, and play the first episode on disk 3, you may think you saw this episode when watching a previous disk.  If so, you received one of the old release DVD sets.  You probably bought it from an Amazon affiliate such as ""mnmsales"", not Amazon direct.  This is what I did as recently as August 2008.

Warner Home Video will fix this problem for you at no charge a lot faster than mnmsales will.  Warner recalled the defective set way back in January 2008, replacing it with a different UPC.  Why mnmsales  is selling this recalled stock beats me, but they are not answering my email request for a replacement.

If your disk 3 is affected, call 1-800-553-6937 and Warner will arrange to ship you a replacement disk 3 and a reply-paid envelope to return the bad one.  I guess if you don't return the bad disk they will want money for the new one which is fair.",1225670400,51,1000,4.34054054054054

The writing is sharp, the dialogue witty, the issues are timely and the ensemble cast is simply excellent. All that, plus a show that never plays it safe!

Fans of '24' should check this out to see it done right. No soap opera, no throw-away characters, no shallow characterizations, no hyperbole...just one emotionally-taught, gut-wrenching episode after another.

3102892,5,B0013BDQ42,"(Note: spoilers for previous season and this one may pop up in the following review.)

When the last season ended, Adam (Rupert Penry Jones) had been injured when an ex-5 agent went on a shooting spree. As this season begins, Adam goes through a very quick (on-screen, anyway) recovery after almost dying on the operating table.  He might be back at work, but his spirit is definitely damaged. Last season, his wife was killed (she died in his arms) and he now faces the prospect of raising his son alone.

Then, of course, he is shot. He later witnesses the unprovoked shooting of a woman he is trying to keep safe (she was basically put at risk as a part of an operation Adam was running). It is all too much for him, and we watch him come apart this season. Penry-Jones is superb here, maintaining that steely determination while he balances on a razor's edge of near-hysteria. He suffers through nightmares, stumbles around almost zombie-like at times, and basically disconnects himself from reality at various turns, and Penry-Jones does an excellent job of showing that process.

Other actors are superb as well, most notably the one who plays Roz. She is a new addition to the team, having been brought in after her father is revealed as a very bad guy.

This season deals with a variety of issues, including the erosion of civil liberties (an issue here in the States as well as in the UK), the threat of nuclear proliferation (the US is a bit of a bad guy here), and cover-ups on the part of different agencies. All the episodes are gripping and even educational.

Excellent season. Enjoy!",1202342400,17,1598,4.648936170212766

Defective Recall for MI-5 - Volume 5 | DVD News and Reviews | 1/29/2008
Warner Home Video, which distributes DVDs on behalf of BBC Video, has issued an immediate recall notice for their recently released MI-5 - Volume 5 package. Since the set hit stores on January 8th, consumers have reported that episodes on the third disc simply will not play. The studio has verified the issue, and initiated this recall ""due to a manufacturing error on Disc 3.""The defective version being recalled can be identified with UPC # 794051423429, and the new release (which is expected to ship on January 31st) will have UPC # 883929017317. Not everyone's copy is defective; fellow DVD Team member Gord Lacey tells me that his third disc works just fine!

I love this series! In my DVD set I recieved two #2 DVDs! From reading the reviews it appears disk #3 has problems. I called BBC America and they have set up a phone number for problems with this volume:

1-800-553-6937

3102896,4,B0013BDQ42,"Ok, I haven't seen series five yet, but I've seen one through four and this is, hands-down, one of the best TV productions I've ever seen.  I came to Amazon this morning to buy the fifth volume but read the reviews and am put off by the disk problems.  So, as I have three small, multi-region DVD players, I went over to Amazon.uk and bought it, though in the UK, the series is ""Spooks"".  I figure even with the exchange it's still cheaper and I can be fairly sure there will be no missing episodes.  I completely recommend this show to anyone interested in this type of programming.  As good as ""24"" is, ""MI-5"" (aka ""Spooks""), blows it away and that's saying something. If you're new to MI-5, begin with volume one.  Each episode is a complete story but in other ways, each episode is dependant on the ones before.  If you start in the middle, you'll be confused. As it's made by the Brits, they assume we're intelligent adults and treat us accordingly.",1201564800,3,954,4.448275862068965
3102897,3,B0013BDQ42,"""Spooks"" has always been infinitely superior to ""24"": better scripts, tighter ensemble acting, stronger use of split screen techniques, and most importantly, there's nothing cartoonish.  In ""24,"" it's basically Jack against the world and he's a regular Terminator and terrible things happen without really affecting him or others.  In ""Spooks,"" the effects of being shot or seeing a loved one shot go on and on as in real life and the team always suffers as it tries to recover.  The show is also very funny and witty, while dealing with heavy issues (like torture) in a much deeper way than ""24"" does.  All that said, Season 5 is a mixed bag.  The 2-part opener is stunning, taking inter-agency rivalry to a new, dangerous height with national implications.  However, Episode 8 is talky, slow, and ridiculous, with a foreign intelligence agency involving itself in something so minor (from the point of view of its national interest) that you think the writers must have been desperate or drunk. They've also used Ros, who is delightfully tough as nails, to be the occasional seductive person on the inside that Zoe and Fiona have been before, but she's too bony, plain, and doesn't quite pull off being the femme fatale.  It leaves a hole in the show and makes you wonder what they were thinking when they cast her.  Still, it's an exciting, thought-provoking and often riveting season, even with these weaknesses.",1201564800,3,1416,4.920168067226891

3102899,5,B0013BDQ42,"I loved Series 5 as much as I loved the other 4.  I am totally hooked on this show: love the characters, love the stories, love (almost) everything about it.  There are times, intellectually and otherwise, when I really have to stretch the mental muscles that suspend my disbelief, but the show's escapism/entertainment value, and the consistently fantastic acting performances of both regular cast and guest stars is worth it to me (Peter Firth is a god; I get a big kick out of watching Nicola Walker, Hermione Norris, and Hugh Simon as well--although there was a time or two when I wanted to slap Rupert Penry-Jones silly--or at the very least, Adam Carter). There was some clunkiness to some of the storyline transitions (I thought that true of the first episode in particular, with the disposition of Angela Well's storyline), but I could get past that. My one pet peeve is that it's sometimes difficult to watch, as an American (since we're often portrayed so unsympathetically, I guess). The anti-Americanism stings and can be uncomfortable to watch--although I admit it does provide some food for thought.  Anyway, I'm glad I didn't wait for the US version to come out, considering all the problems other people are having with the discs. (And I have to say--the third disc was my favorite.) I actually broke down and bought a multi-format region-free DVD player and ordered the series from amazon.uk last fall (*&^%$#@ exchange rate!) so I didn't have to wait so long to get it (very glad I did, now, though).  I've already got Series 6 pre-ordered from amazon.uk so I'll get it when it's released this fall.  Obsessed much?  You betcha.

However, since Amazon is doubtless aware by now of this massive manufacturing defect, I think they should be more forthcoming and helpful.  I received this as a gift (and there've been other problems with the whole wishlist thing), and now have the hassle of returns, etc.  I've e-mailed customer service twice about their failure to address this situation, and provide some sort of resolution for the problem.  Each time, the response consisted of canned sentences about not being able to get the product from their supplier.  I'll admit I'm a total MI 5 addict, as are most people who would buy a boxed set of a fifth season, I suppose.  But, I'd rather get my intrigue ""fix"" from viewing the disc, rather than wondering when/if it will show up.  So, all in all, this is really a review of the manufacturers and amazon.

I'm sure the company that provided this series on dvd, BBC Video, will correct this mistake and release a quality set.

I have to say that other than that I think that the BBC have done an awfully good job in pushing this show back to the dizzy heights of the first season. You are always surprised by the loss of characters which happens at unforseen times but the new ones are often rough diamonds which soon are polished especially the new character of Ros...one to watch there. Can we trust her? Is she as honest as she says? Time alone will tell.

There are some really solid storylines here, stellar performances and far far too many realistic scenarios especially in the last episode.

I am not surprised A&E have chosen not to broadcast this season, they are probably too scared of all of the issues that might arise from groups who could take offence and some of the powerful political lobby groups in the States.

I will admit there is a little more angst in season 5 for the sake of drama, but other than that it's perfect & cleverly entertaining. The episodes kept me riveted at the edge of my seat, especially the second two-part story with an interesting twist.  I especially enjoyed the introduction of Hermoine Norris's character ""Roz"" into this series. She's tough as nails, a risk taker, and stands by her convictions. I was sorry to see what happened to a couple of characters, but that's the hazard these story characters takes in the spook world. The entire cast worked really well together.

Peter Firth and Rupert Penry-Jones especially turn in one riveting performance after another.  I hate to get too attached to any one character, considering the writer's penchant for eliminating one major player after another.  Two longtime cast members made their exit in series 5 (this is one of the aspects of MI 5 which sets it apart from other television series). Don't try to multitask while watching MI 5 - the show demands all of your attention - so settle down with a glass of wine (or a glass of Harry's favorite - Glenfiddich Scotch) and savor this very fine series from across the Pond.

It continues to draw from the headlines of today's CNN/BBC News formats with thoroughly believable storylines addressing intra-government power struggles, African nationalism, fanatical terrorist, religious fundamentalism, and espionage that is pitch perfect. The superior ensemble cast alas, is whittled down from the original team, loosing long-time computer/techno geek Rory MacGregor and the lovely and loyal Ruth Evershed.  All that remains of the original crew is in command, staid Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) whose bittersweet office romance with Ruth is shafted as it falters.  Widower Adam Carter (Rupert Penry-Jones) is at studly top form showing off both his weakened single state to the young nanny as well as a nice backside, but his travails strain both mental and physical talents as Adam must lead his new team into the fray.  The addition of a new team member Ros Myers adds ying to Adam's yang and their clashes are both head to head and more so.

Contrasted with ""24"" and the Jack Bauer character -- both of which I think are also brilliant -- I'd have to say that while MI-5 keeps growing, 24 would fall apart if Jack were to die suddenly.

There wasn't any major effort to integrate the new characters in MI-5, and their back-stories were brief; but it just worked.

One huge advantage to having the dvds is that you get the whole episode as it was shown in the UK.

I came to Amazon this morning to buy the fifth volume but read the reviews and am put off by the disk problems. So, as I have three small, multi-region DVD players, I went over to Amazon.uk and bought it, though in the UK, the series is ""Spooks"". I figure even with the exchange it's still cheaper and I can be fairly sure there will be no missing episodes. I completely recommend this show to anyone interested in this type of programming. As good as ""24"" is, ""MI-5"" (aka ""Spooks""), blows it away and that's saying something. If you're new to MI-5, begin with volume one. Each episode is a complete story but in other ways, each episode is dependant on the ones before. If you start in the middle, you'll be confused. As it's made by the Brits, they assume we're intelligent adults and treat us accordingly.",1438992000,,947,4.448275862068965

I have to say that other than that I think that the BBC have done an awfully good job in pushing this show back to the dizzy heights of the first season. You are always surprised by the loss of characters which happens at unforseen times but the new ones are often rough diamonds which soon are polished especially the new character of Rosone to watch there. Can we trust her? Is she as honest as she says? Time alone will tell.

There are some really solid storylines here, stellar performances and far far too many realistic scenarios especially in the last episode.

I am not surprised A&E have chosen not to broadcast this season, they are probably too scared of all of the issues that might arise from groups who could take offence and some of the powerful political lobby groups in the States.

So I then went down to my public library and started searching on their database to see if they may carry this disc, and yes they did have a few of seasons. Volume 5 was not release on disc yet, in the States. Season 3 was my first take on this program and then I was hook. In my city we once had a Virgin Mega store and where I purchase my torchwood first volume, but for some reason that store did not sell none of these MI-5 programs. I then ask the clerks if and why not the store don't have this program. And if the Store can order the disc and they said at the time that those disc are really expensive, and will not carry those shows, and yet they had other British, Foreign and other Obscure films that was more expensive in there collection. I saw that my local library got Volume-5 on their shelves so I grab and watch and love this show. When I was able to purchase for my own collection I notice that in Volume-3 and 5. Because I watch disc season 1 through 6 from the library that in volume-3 that the character Zoe had to go to the Mental institution and was pump with so much drugs that she was never the same nor that character returned. In my personnel collection that same character came back from her nervous condition and started a family and was able to move on from MI-5. I own volume-3,5-10. When I came across Volume-5 I purchase at a local music store a few years back my disc 3 is blank also and that the best episode ever! I was so devastated because I remember that the character call Ruth had to leave or walk away from MI-5. I don't want to spoiled want happen to those devoted fans out there, but I be leaved that The BBC America programs are slightly alter because the British shows ten to be a little bit involved , and you have to really pay attention.",1385424000,,1921,4.180592991913747

What a great show--well acted (no heavy British dialects making us Yanks wish for subtitles) with exciting stories, believable characters in current events context.  Except for Harry (think ""M"") the main characters come in and out (often by death unfortunately) from season to season.  I miss the characters I grow used to, but the replacements are just as intriguing.

As a Prime customer, all was good until a few weeks ago as the MI-5 series was included for free.  Then, out of the blue, it was dropped from free streaming.  The official word from customer service was ""Shows and movies available in our Prime instant video service may change from time to time depending on our agreements with content owners.""  But if I were cynical, I would say it was a strategy to get the customer hooked and then start charging.

Regardless, that was a great disappointment.  As much as I loved the series, I can't bring myself to paying 2 bucks a show to continue as there are quite a lot of shows to go.  Alas!",1364083200,,1066,4.592592592592593

3337355,5,B0013BDQ42,"Now in its fifth season, MI-5 continues to retains its seemingly impossible-to-achieve status as one of the smartest, most intelligent, and most dramatic shows you'll ever see. ""MI-5,"" a domestic intelligence service composed of a group of British citizen individuals who join ""5"" to help ""defend the realm,"" is set apart from the external security service, ""MI-6,"" which focus more on international and extra-national concerns that may impact the security of the UK. Under its mandate, MI-5 deals with economic, terrorist, civil uprisings, or even any externally originating threat that has found its way back to the UK. The series introduces us to all kinds of real-world threats--both potential and operationally in motion--and shows how the members of ""5"" must react in order to counter and/or eliminate these threats. The series is so well written, produced, directed, filmed, and acted that each episode is more of a 60-minute movie than a television episode. The drama, intrigue, intelligent stories, and, yes, action, establish the series as a standout among even the often high-achieving BBC (already the producer of many world-class shows), making it with little doubt one of the best shows of this nature ever made.

Season Five maintains, and in some ways, surpasses the drama of the previous seasons by opening up an entirely new line of threat to the country which involves both organizational and personal ""baggage"" from members of both ""5"" and ""6."" As is the case in a number of the later seasons (particularly seasons 5 - 9), the story line weaves an intricate and complex path throughout the episodes, making it requisite that one watch these in order to receive maximum impact and understanding. But I must admit incredulity that the show could surpass the amazing job it has already done in the previous four seasons. I liken the show to one of those plate twirlers who gets a plate spinning up in the air at the top of one of those skinny sticks, and while you are trying to understand how he is doing it, starts another plate stirring on a second stick while keeping the first going. And then, to your incredulity, he adds yet a third plate on a third stick, and now maintains all three plates. You scratch your head with amazement even as you watch him keep all three plates twirling on those sticks, and yet he does it right in front of you. Yet the Fifth Season of MI-5 is just like that: there appears to be no limits to the manner in which the show can continue to exceed itself.

Again, because of the complexity and the intellectual development of characters (as well as the plots themselves), it is best to watch MI-5 in order by both season and episode, with no skipping of episodes, and this makes the DVD release of the show perhaps the very best manner in which to view the production. The DVDs allow you to step your way through each season, episode by episode, thereby viewing the show in the manner in which it was intended to be viewed. This gives you the ability to watch how characters are developed, and to better gain an understanding of how the MI-5 Section D group works. With the exception of the very first episode of Season One (the first episode is really not up to the standards of all the remaining ones, an issue attributable to the difficulties inherent in plot development) the shows are incredibly exciting, but also intelligently written in a way that will make you re-think the issues surrounding the role of the security forces in countries, what actions should and should not be allowed, the best way to address classes of threats, the implications for a free society when eliminating threats, the intersection of political and security concerns, and much more. You might at first glace think that MI-5, as an entertainment production, would be no more than that; but MI-5 is certainly more than a simple entertainment show. Be prepared to be entertained, but also mentally stimulated.

This is a truly amazing show. It's easily seven stars out of five. And the prices of the discs have come down dramatically from earlier years. But don't forget: you need to watch these in order, starting with Season One. If you haven't seen it yet, start with Season One, work your way through that first not-so-good episode, and then watch the thing take of a like a jet. You'll be hooked by the time you get to the end of the first season, and the second set won't arrive at your doorstep quickly enough.",1325635200,6,4451,4.770428015564202

3337361,4,B0013BDQ42,"MI-5 just continues to grab my attention. I was excited about Season 5 to find out what happened to Adam after he was hit by a sniper in last season's cliffhanger. Let's say the cliffhanger is resolved in seconds in the premiere episode. Quickly, MI-5 is back in motion with an emotionally crippled Adam. Adam's lingering psychological problems over his near death experience and the loss of his beloved wife in a botched mission last season become an ongoing threat to the efficiency and safety of MI-5 through the following episodes and his colleagues begin to question his judgement.

I started to feel the show was losing a bit of steam midway through the season. If it's not the Islamic terrorist, it's people pretending to be Islamic terrorists, or various terrorists trying to outdo the Islamic terrorists. One episode did feature Christian terrorists trying to bring Christianity back to ALL of Britain.

One thing that amazes me is how much of actual and real London we see in the series. Threats are to actual known locations in London. I wonder how that feels to a city that has known terrorism for decades. Does it add to the realism or is it giving ideas to the wrong people?

The last episode involved environmental terrorists intent on blowing up the Thames barrier if their demands were not met. It's a good bit of high tense drama that made me curious about what the Thames barrier does. What happened with the Thames before there was the barrier. Could terrorists really gain access to the barrier as they do in the series. The cliffhanger is A+++. There was an obvious way to end the season with an obvious cliffhanger with agents in mortal danger yet there is a complete twist in the plot and it is commendable...a brilliant piece of writing and suspense. The twist is seriously unnerving and frightening but totally believable in the context of the story. Now I have to get Season 6.

There is constant movement in the cast of MI-5. Only a few remain through the series and there is always some shift. Season 5 introduces us to Ros Meyer played by the remarkable Hermionie Norris. I enjoyed her in WIRE IN THE BLOOD but she left part way through the series so I wonder if it was to move to MI-5. We first meet Ros where she seems to be part of her father's plot to bring down the government. So watch and see how she ends up an MI-5 agent. She's cold, heartless and somewhat ruthless at the beginning--not the most loveable of the team and not one to bring in homemade baked goods to share with coworkers. No problem is an innocent person must be sacrificed to save the masses. That is our Ros.

Series 5 delves into the personal life of Adam at the expense of the other agents. I would like to see more of the personal lives of the other agents. How do they lead a duel life with family and friends who think they have normal jobs. Harry and Ruth come close to hooking up and there is a story that I hope will be explored more in the future.

I love MI-5 but it is relies heavily on cliches recycled material. As you watch MI-5, you can always be sure at least one cast member will die during the series. Britain, especially London, is always under threat of a major and devastating terrorist attack. There is always a double agent in MI-5 or the British government feeding information to the ""bad guys"". The MI-5 quickly realizes the terrorist have inside information. MI-5 agents always have to make a potentially disastrous decision to override a superior's direct orders or the directives of the British government. The MI-5 agents always know better. Sometimes the threat involves a member of the government and if his role is discovered, ""it will bring down the government."" You'll had that term more than once or twice. Tiny gadgets and cameras can always keep track of an agent's moment in a threatening situation. They can be warned what threat lays around the corner or where the next exit is. The amazing fact is it all reels us in and it is part of the fun. The MI-5 agents always realize what is really happening but arrive seconds too late to save an innocent victim.

MI-5 is sheer high tech spy fun. It is silly and hokey at times but it all works and it is totally worth the time to enjoy this fantastic series.",1318896000,2,4250,4.54046997389034
3337362,3,B0013BDQ42,MI-5 is an awesome show and its always very gripping! You never know when or who will die suddenly or what will happen next which is why I love watching it. I was vastly disappointed to find out when I opened the case (a year after getting it with a season 1-6 set) that I was missing disk #5 and had 2 disk #3s. Amazingly even though this is the UPC of the defective sets the disk #3s appear to work! I just can't move on to season 6 though without season 5's 5th disk,1315353600,,469,3.9473684210526314

3337365,2,B0013BDQ42,"The MI5 series started as a no-nonsense series with spooks able to deal with all kinds of situations. But as the series continues, and especially in the 5th season, it becomes politically correct to modern standards. Suddenly the officers don't carry arms anymore, or at least very seldom, and the enemies are sought more within the British system than outsides, especially in the Arab and/or Muslim world. There is less violence than in the beginning, and there is more ""let's talk about it"" atmosphere. Very disappointing. But the situation changes if suspected Israeli agents come into play. Suddenly they are the bad guys, suddenly they are more violent than any other counterpart MI5 encountered in the last 4 seasons and suddenly the SAS, when storming an embassy (again) can shoot straight. Of course they shoot the Israelis, even when they are on the ground, numb from an explosion. You wouldn't (and haven't) see this when it comes to Muslim terrorists. But as it's only Israelis, nobody cares.
Oh, and yes, of course, in this seasons more than ever before the Americans are the bad and stupid ones, and the spooks of her Majesty are of course, although outnumbered and out-resourced, the heroes.
Rather cheap and disappointing. Another thing is that after politics economic powers took over: I appreciated the car diversity in this series - Peugeot, Lexus, Renault, Jaguar, LAnd Rover ... all kind of cars. Since season 5 the Volkswagen Group took over, and Harry switches to Audi, Ruth to SEAT, the SAS arrives in a VW van, and even the Israeli ambassador drives a Porsche (which no Israeli ambassador I know would do). It is a pitty. I strongly reconsider buying the following seasons.
So, for all the viewers who would like to see unarmed far-from-reality agents acting politically correct, bashing Americans and Israelis - go and watch MI5. For those who liked the first three seasons - don't continue to season 5. Keep the good memory of the first seasons.",1304640000,,1971,4.921921921921922

I'm uncertain as to why Season five is listed under Prime and charges .99 per episode. As far as I can tell it's the only season that doesn't fall under the package deal.

So about the actual episode. Really great. MI5 has become one of my favorite shows. And this episode is one of the reasons why. Constant introduction of new (and potentially dangerous) characters, plot twists, plots with-in plots. Unexpected deaths. This episode does has it all. Oh and it was a great follow-up to the previous seasons close.

I'm not being specific as I don't want to reveal anything. It would be hard to say much without doing so. I will say that it wouldn't hurt to do a little home-work on Djakarta. I took a look at Wikipedia and searched Naomi Klein's Shock Doctrine - The later proved to be of greater relevance.

3337370,3,B0013BDQ42,"MI-5 (Spooks) has been a favorite for years.  The situations are gripping; the characters memorable, each with a unique style and voice that keeps things fresh, particularly through cast changes.  I fear, however, that with each passing series, the show is sliding more and more into implausible sensationalism.  I call this ""ER Syndrome"":  Like MI-5, ER was a wonderful show with with excellent characters & smart writing.  Eventually, ER's producers & writers started to put in the ocassional sensational episode to grab a quick ratings boost.  At first, this was OK.  One could imagine a gunman in an inner-city ER, or a psycho patient attacking a doctor.  However, the producers & writers grew lazy and the show got addicted to the sensational.  It was as if they were afraid that their audience would check out without the catastrophy of the day.  Hence, a parade of bombs, plagues, gun-fire, helicopter accidents, amazing rescues, etc.  The show became a wan characature of itself, ending a 1/2 dozen years past its prime.

I fear that MI-5 is going down this same path.  With Series 5, it seems that every week the team of 1/2 dozen people had to save all of London (or England) from an incredible catastrophy.  I won't go into specifics so as not to spoil anything, but what was once suspenseful and plausible is starting to turn sensationalistic and cheap.

Having said all that, however, MI-5 is still wonderful & certainly better than drama that can be found on US television.  However, measured against itself, MI-5 is not what it was and I fear that, unless changes are made, it will continue to slide down the path toward the inane.",1281312000,3,1646,4.825

They have carried this style of TV drama to the next level. From an American point of view, it is interesting to get another country's point of view on international terrorism.

I confess, and maybe some other Spooks junkies will confess the same, but when I received the series dvd's I watched 10 hours in a row with minor breaks for essentials, finally quitting at 3AM. This series is absolutely knockout. One reviewer wrote being a bit put off by the variety of villains there are in the world coming from all nations with all beleifs. Is it possible? You decide.

3337376,5,B0013BDQ42,"MI-5- the Spooks, the intelligence branch of the British Government has always had a glamorous aspect to it from the American side. Afterall these are the best of the UK.  Following the BBC series brings the reality home to us. Yes, they all carry guns and are faced with danger every day, but there is a lot of daily 'grunt' work involved.

Harry Pearce, played by Peter Firth is the Head of the Counter Terrorism Department.  He is the constant in this seriesl. He is one of the few, so far, that has not been killed off. He is the consummate professional that pulls the team back to reality. He is also ready to give up a member of the team if need be. He is the father of the group and each team member is part of his family.

Adam Carter, played bt Rupert Penny Jones, is the MI-5 Senior Case Leader. He is a formidable character- ready to lead his team into danger to keep the UK free.  He is suffering from PTSD because of his wife's death. It appears from the signals in the series that we should be prepared for Adam's demise. He has had too many close calla. Rupert is the mainstay of this series and he is a fave.

Ros Myers, played by Hermoine Norris is the heroine of the MI-5. Cold, ruthless and beautiful, we know that Ros is lonely and this exterior she portrays has a  great deal of hurt underneath.

Malcom Wynn-Jones, played by Hugh Simon plays the technician and data analyst. He is another mainstay of MI-5. He is the one that provides most of the information needed and is the person who is most responsible for keeping the MI-5 team alive.

The rest of the team, walk in and out of the series. We just get to know them and they are killed in one manner or another. This series is remarkable in that death of a character is as much a part of reality as introducing someone new.

Volume 5 starts with a terrorirst attack on the oil and gas depots. Moves on to the loss of one of the most lovable characters, to an enviornmental group threatening to flood London. Throughout the series, Harry Pearce defends and delivers his MI-5 team to their highest acheievements. This is the series set that deals with terrorism. MI-5 is always current, the events of the world end up in this Spooks series. The United States oftne comes across as devious and deceitful- well, why not, look at our past eight years and our leaders. But the UK takes its own hits and all the thorns seem to come undone. This series also introduced us to the persomal side of the team, and their empotional and family upheavels.

Highly Highly Recommended.  prisrob 02-22-09

3337379,5,B0013BDQ42,"To be fair this is more of a composite review for series 3-5. I tend to agree with the reviewers who felt the series fell flat in series 3 (with the exception of the cliff hanger carried over from series 2). Things start to pick up in series 4 with the series 3 cliff hanger carry over. There is however, one episode where Adam goes under cover as a Syrian (speaking English with an Arab accent) that simply doesn't work.

In an earlier review I commented on how characters fell off the series, with a much greater frequency relative to American television. I have changed my stance and have gotten behind this as a useful maneuver to keep the series fresh.

In summation:

Series 3 = 3*

Series 4 (though the final 2 episodes) = 4*-4 1/2*

Series 5 (including the final episodes of series 4) = 5* along with my personal statement that this is some of the best TV I have ever seen

When you receive this DVD set, and play the first episode on disk 3, you may think you saw this episode when watching a previous disk.  If so, you received one of the old release DVD sets.  You probably bought it from an Amazon affiliate such as ""mnmsales"", not Amazon direct.  This is what I did as recently as August 2008.

Warner Home Video will fix this problem for you at no charge a lot faster than mnmsales will.  Warner recalled the defective set way back in January 2008, replacing it with a different UPC.

If your disk 3 is affected, call 1-800-553-6937 and Warner will arrange to ship you a replacement disk 3 and a reply-paid envelope to return the bad one.  I guess if you don't return the bad disk they will want money for the new one which is fair.",1225670400,51,1000,4.34054054054054

3337389,5,B0013BDQ42,"(Note: spoilers for previous season and this one may pop up in the following review.)

When the last season ended, Adam (Rupert Penry Jones) had been injured when an ex-5 agent went on a shooting spree. As this season begins, Adam goes through a very quick (on-screen, anyway) recovery after almost dying on the operating table.  He might be back at work, but his spirit is definitely damaged. Last season, his wife was killed (she died in his arms) and he now faces the prospect of raising his son alone.

Then, of course, he is shot. He later witnesses the unprovoked shooting of a woman he is trying to keep safe (she was basically put at risk as a part of an operation Adam was running). It is all too much for him, and we watch him come apart this season. Penry-Jones is superb here, maintaining that steely determination while he balances on a razor's edge of near-hysteria. He suffers through nightmares, stumbles around almost zombie-like at times, and basically disconnects himself from reality at various turns, and Penry-Jones does an excellent job of showing that process.

Other actors are superb as well, most notably the one who plays Roz. She is a new addition to the team, having been brought in after her father is revealed as a very bad guy.

This season deals with a variety of issues, including the erosion of civil liberties (an issue here in the States as well as in the UK), the threat of nuclear proliferation (the US is a bit of a bad guy here), and cover-ups on the part of different agencies. All the episodes are gripping and even educational.

3337391,5,B0013BDQ42,"Hello,

I love this series! In my DVD set I recieved two #2 DVDs! From reading the reviews it appears disk #3 has problems. I called BBC America and they have set up a phone number for problems with this volume:

1-800-553-6937

I called and they are shipping me a new DVD #3.",1202083200,,276,4.169811320754717
3337392,1,B0013BDQ42,Great show. Disk 3 is defective as other customers have found out. It does not play.,1201824000,2,84,4.3125
3337393,4,B0013BDQ42,"Ok, I haven't seen series five yet, but I've seen one through four and this is, hands-down, one of the best TV productions I've ever seen.  I came to Amazon this morning to buy the fifth volume but read the reviews and am put off by the disk problems.  So, as I have three small, multi-region DVD players, I went over to Amazon.uk and bought it, though in the UK, the series is ""Spooks"".  I figure even with the exchange it's still cheaper and I can be fairly sure there will be no missing episodes.  I completely recommend this show to anyone interested in this type of programming.  As good as ""24"" is, ""MI-5"" (aka ""Spooks""), blows it away and that's saying something. If you're new to MI-5, begin with volume one.  Each episode is a complete story but in other ways, each episode is dependant on the ones before.  If you start in the middle, you'll be confused. As it's made by the Brits, they assume we're intelligent adults and treat us accordingly.",1201564800,3,954,4.448275862068965
3337394,3,B0013BDQ42,"""Spooks"" has always been infinitely superior to ""24"": better scripts, tighter ensemble acting, stronger use of split screen techniques, and most importantly, there's nothing cartoonish.  In ""24,"" it's basically Jack against the world and he's a regular Terminator and terrible things happen without really affecting him or others.  In ""Spooks,"" the effects of being shot or seeing a loved one shot go on and on as in real life and the team always suffers as it tries to recover.  The show is also very funny and witty, while dealing with heavy issues (like torture) in a much deeper way than ""24"" does.  All that said, Season 5 is a mixed bag.  The 2-part opener is stunning, taking inter-agency rivalry to a new, dangerous height with national implications.  However, Episode 8 is talky, slow, and ridiculous, with a foreign intelligence agency involving itself in something so minor (from the point of view of its national interest) that you think the writers must have been desperate or drunk. They've also used Ros, who is delightfully tough as nails, to be the occasional seductive person on the inside that Zoe and Fiona have been before, but she's too bony, plain, and doesn't quite pull off being the femme fatale.  It leaves a hole in the show and makes you wonder what they were thinking when they cast her.  Still, it's an exciting, thought-provoking and often riveting season, even with these weaknesses.",1201564800,3,1416,4.920168067226891
3337395,5,B0013BDQ42,I LOVE THIS SHOW. but I am having the same problem with disc 3. Amazon customer service is not very usefull as all they can tell me is that it is no longer available and all they can do is refund me. I cant believe that this is true and not another example of excellent(sarcasm) customer service being outsourced,1201305600,,312,4.305084745762712
3337396,5,B0013BDQ42,"I loved Series 5 as much as I loved the other 4.  I am totally hooked on this show: love the characters, love the stories, love (almost) everything about it.  There are times, intellectually and otherwise, when I really have to stretch the mental muscles that suspend my disbelief, but the show's escapism/entertainment value, and the consistently fantastic acting performances of both regular cast and guest stars is worth it to me (Peter Firth is a god; I get a big kick out of watching Nicola Walker, Hermione Norris, and Hugh Simon as well--although there was a time or two when I wanted to slap Rupert Penry-Jones silly--or at the very least, Adam Carter). There was some clunkiness to some of the storyline transitions (I thought that true of the first episode in particular, with the disposition of Angela Well's storyline), but I could get past that. My one pet peeve is that it's sometimes difficult to watch, as an American (since we're often portrayed so unsympathetically, I guess). The anti-Americanism stings and can be uncomfortable to watch--although I admit it does provide some food for thought.  Anyway, I'm glad I didn't wait for the US version to come out, considering all the problems other people are having with the discs. (And I have to say--the third disc was my favorite.) I actually broke down and bought a multi-format region-free DVD player and ordered the series from amazon.uk last fall (*&^%$#@ exchange rate!) so I didn't have to wait so long to get it (very glad I did, now, though).  I've already got Series 6 pre-ordered from amazon.uk so I'll get it when it's released this fall.  Obsessed much?  You betcha. And you couldn't pry those discs from my happy little fingers!",1201219200,,1709,4.835616438356165
3337397,1,B0013BDQ42,"I've seen from other reviews that many people encountered a defective disc 3 in this set.  And as another reviewer wrote, it's a relief (in a way) to know it's not just me.  However, since Amazon is doubtless aware by now of this massive manufacturing defect, I think they should be more forthcoming and helpful.  I received this as a gift (and there've been other problems with the whole wishlist thing), and now have the hassle of returns, etc.  I've e-mailed customer service twice about their failure to address this situation, and provide some sort of resolution for the problem.  Each time, the response consisted of canned sentences about not being able to get the product from their supplier.  I'll admit I'm a total MI 5 addict, as are most people who would buy a boxed set of a fifth season, I suppose.  But, I'd rather get my intrigue ""fix"" from viewing the disc, rather than wondering when/if it will show up.  So, all in all, this is really a review of the manufacturers and amazon.  I love the episodes I did get to see!",1200960000,2,1034,4.545945945945946
3337398,1,B0013BDQ42,"If you read the other comments it will seem clear that this dvd set is defective. That's why Amazon is not carrying it and is only being sold by smarmy marketplace sellers who have jacked up the price on used movies to try to make something back. However, they will not tell you that there is a problem with disc 3. I will. Wait patiently. I'm sure the company that provided this series on dvd, BBC Video, will correct this mistake and release a quality set.

I'm giving a rating of 1 for this product. That is strictly for the packaging. My review will go up to 5 when this issue is resolved and series 5 is made available in a quality release with no bugs.",1200960000,,658,4.222222222222222
3337399,4,B0013BDQ42,"I had the same problem as most of the other reviewers in that I am one episode short but with another episode duplicated.

I have to say that other than that I think that the BBC have done an awfully good job in pushing this show back to the dizzy heights of the first season. You are always surprised by the loss of characters which happens at unforseen times but the new ones are often rough diamonds which soon are polished especially the new character of Ros...one to watch there. Can we trust her? Is she as honest as she says? Time alone will tell.

There are some really solid storylines here, stellar performances and far far too many realistic scenarios especially in the last episode.

I am not surprised A&E have chosen not to broadcast this season, they are probably too scared of all of the issues that might arise from groups who could take offence and some of the powerful political lobby groups in the States.

Overall I think this season has been superb but I hace to say, One Episode short of a 5 Star.",1200873600,,1020,4.409574468085107
3337400,2,B0013BDQ42,"I've really enjoyed all the installments of this series and I eagerly awaited volume 5. It finally came and everything was good until I got to disc 3, it just wouldn't play. Tried it on a couple of systems just to make sure it wasn't my set. Same results.

Sent that set back and got a replacement, same thing happened. Now I'm really unhappy because this problem has left me hanging to see the rest of the series. Hopefully this will be rectified soon.",1200700800,,453,4.392857142857143
3337401,5,B0013BDQ42,"MI-5 season 5 definitely demonstrates this series is still the ultimate SPOOK (Spy)show on TV with excitingly intelligent,complicated,innovative stories.  I will admit there is a little more angst in season 5 for the sake of drama, but other than that it's perfect & cleverly entertaining. The episodes kept me riveted at the edge of my seat, especially the second two-part story with an interesting twist.  I especially enjoyed the introduction of Hermoine Norris's character ""Roz"" into this series. She's tough as nails, a risk taker, and stands by her convictions. I was sorry to see what happened to a couple of characters, but that's the hazard these story characters takes in the spook world. The entire cast worked really well together. As for my dvd set, I had no bad disks and were in perfect operating condition.

I highly recommend this season/series to those who enjoy a good thriller!",1200614400,,897,5.006711409395973
3337402,4,B0013BDQ42,"I think I got lucky, because I got a bad disc 3, but the replacement I recieved worked great! It sounds like I got lucky. For those who didn't, I wanted to let you know there are good copies out there! Good luck!

In regards to the show, great season. Sometimes I wish the cast shake-ups weren't as often. Still a solid season. Wish the finale had a little more intensity to it. The finales for Seasons 1&2 are my favorites, followed closely by 4.

Best of luck getting a good set, the missing episode is important and worth the wait!",1200528000,,534,4.2772277227722775
3337403,5,B0013BDQ42,"Love the series - huge fan, and season five continues to deliver. Other reveiws go into more detail on that front.

I just want to say that even though the series remains for sale through other sellers, do not buy until you know the disk three issue is fixed. I just bought it as of Jan. 17th, 2008 and it is a problem that they will refund your money but not send a replacement. Wait until confirmation that new sets are fixed.

3337404,4,B0013BDQ42,I give the show itself 4 stars. I would give it 5 but the problems with disk three prevents me from doing so.

3337405,1,B0013BDQ42,"So I am not the only one who has a defective disc 3?  That's reassuring, but infuriating. How can Amazon continue to sell this broken junk?  I am sending back my replacement set and will certainly pay more attention to these comments than before.  Maybe this is a ruse by NetFlix to get me to wait in line for the damn thing?

3337407,5,B0013BDQ42,"First, I have to disclose that I am both an anglophile and a spooksphile.  This series is addictive for those of us with a predilection for well-acted and well-written drama.  Peter Firth and Rupert Penry-Jones especially turn in one riveting performance after another.  I hate to get too attached to any one character, considering the writer's penchant for eliminating one major player after another.  Two longtime cast members made their exit in series 5 (this is one of the aspects of MI 5 which sets it apart from other television series). Don't try to multitask while watching MI 5 - the show demands all of your attention - so settle down with a glass of wine (or a glass of Harry's favorite - Glenfiddich Scotch) and savor this very fine series from across the Pond.
P.S. Beware of 1 thing.  Something went wrong in the manufacture of disk 3 - it repeated episode 3 from disk 2 and episode 5 was missing entirely!",1200441600,4,920,4.619631901840491

Its the same problem other reviewers have had: disk 3 doesn't work or if you can access it, it has a duplicate episode (from the disk 2) and then is missing the next episode in the series, a crucial one that involves a permanent change in the show! None of the other disks have the episode and I have returned 2 of these box-sets so I would say this is definitely a manufacturing problem. Sooo: good luck.",1200182400,23,545,4.102803738317757

8249735,5,B0013BDQ42,"When I watched the first 2 seasons of MI5, I was not particularly impressed.  The plots seemed to be rather simplistic and a bit sort of childish - especially after watching ""24"" - and I kept feeling that I was watching Enid Blyton's ""FAMOUS FIVE"" still having "" AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE"".  The young  core cast seemed awfully immature to be in the vanguard of defending Britain from all it's enemies.  The only one who seemed like he really was a mature member of Great Britain's intelligence community was the character ""Harry Pierce"", played by Peter Firth - always an excellent actor.  He was the only one that I truly believed could be in such a position. I think part of the problem was that the producers and writers couldn't decide exactly what kind of show they wanted it to be, and it was a bit of a mish-mash. So I was not going to purchase Season 3, but then I knew there had been cast changes, so I thought would give it one more try, and I was glad I did.

Season 3 was an improvement, and Season 4 was even better.  And the plots and the acting kept on getting better and better, and better. They brought in new actors that were a great improvement, while keeping Peter Firth and other good believable characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series all the way to the final Season 10. The plots were terrific, well written and intelligent, and full of action and suspense, and I never knew what to expect from one episode to the next.  I found myself getting very fond of the core cast of Harry and Ruth, Adam, Fiona, Zaf, Roz, etc. and I just had to find out what happened next.

One of the other reasons I liked it was that it was relatively free of vulgar language and the sexual gymnastics were within reasonable limits.  We live in a coarse and vulgar age, but at least we have some control over what we bring into our living rooms and this show is one of the most enjoyable for all the above reasons.",1507334400,,1924,4.349162011173185
