2532046,5,B000ERVJMW,"Agreed that Season 8 was not the best season but still better than what passes for TV sitcom today.

Frasier and Cheers were NBC series, so how come the DVD sets are put out by ""CBS DVD""?",1150329600,,187,4.054054054054054
2532047,4,B000ERVJMW,"Frasier is one of the all time great shows, however season 8 is not one of the better seasons of this eleven seasons series.  But as per other reviewers opinions (and strongly supported by me), an average season of Frasier (a.k.a. season 8) is clearly better than just about any comedy show ever produced. A strongly recommended series and those of you not familiar with the characters, I have added a small summary of the main characters of the show.

Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer): The lead character. He holds degrees in psychology from Harvard University and lives in Seattle. His list of selective hobbies include playing the piano, attending the opera and expensive charity events, collecting expensive art and participating in wine tasting events. Of course his main past time is unsuccessfully trying to curb his competitive nature - especially when it comes to his brother Niles.

Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce):  The undoubted star of the show IMHO. Frasier's brother and practicing psychiatrist. Niles shares similar interests and educational background to Frasier (he was however educated at Yale University) and is probably even more finicky than his brother. Niles has an aversion to bugs and has several weird characteristics (extreme ethical standards, strong food allergies, dusting the chair before sitting and so on).

Martin Crane (John Mahoney): Frasier and Niles' father. He was in the police force for long until he was shot in the hip during an armed robbery. Martin moves in with Frasier (bringing his dog and a battered armchair into the life of Frasier and Daphne into the life of Niles). Martin's no-nonsense attitude and straightforward outlook on life often lead to confrontations with Frasier and Niles, who aspire to greater levels of sophistication.

Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves): An immigrant from Manchester, England. Daphne was hired by Frasier to be Martin's physiotherapist. Daphne often relates bizarre tales involving her family.

Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin):  Roz is the producer of Frasier's radio show. Roz is known for her relaxed attitude (especially when it comes to men) and quick-witted remarks, and enjoys deflating Frasier's ego - a favor often reciprocated by Frasier.

Any way the episodes for season 8 are:

1: And the Dish Ran Away with the Spoon: Part 1
2: And the Dish Ran Away with the Spoon: Part 2
3: The Bad Son
4: The Great Crane Robbery
5: Taking Liberties
6: Legal Tender Love and Care
7: The New Friend
8: Mary Christmas
9: Frasier's Edge
10: Cranes Unplugged
11: Motor Skills
12: The Show Must Go Off
13: Sliding Frasiers
14: Hungry Heart
15: Hooping Cranes
16: Docu. Drama
17: It Takes Two to Tangle
18: Forgotten But Not Gone
19: Daphne Returns
20: The Wizard and Roz
21: Semi-Decent Proposal
22: A Passing Fancy
23: A Day in May
24: Cranes Go Caribbean

Once again the entire series is strongly recommended and not only season 8.",1150156800,19,2892,4.954545454545454
2532048,4,B000ERVJMW,"I have been a fan of ""Frasier"" since the pilot episode and for the first seven seasons it was the finest sitcom on television. But time and new writers have taken their toll and it shows in the eighth season.

Although the development of the Niles/Daphne relationship gave ""Frasier"" a new direction to explore, this season lacks the oomph of previous ones.  There is no stand-out episode, just several nice moments spread out over 22 shows.

We start off with the follow-up to last season's climactic ""Something Borrowed, Something Blue"".  And while the presence of Simon (a wonderful Anthony LaPaglia) is very welcome, the episode lacks the zing and fire needed to make it memorable. Follow up episodes get better with great guest stars like in ""The Great Crane Robbery"" featuring an impressionable Alan Tudyk (best known perhaps as ""Steve the Pirate"" from ""Dodgeball"") who copies Frasier's dwelling a bit too much. Or ""Taking Liberties"" with Victor Garber (of ""Alias"" fame) being letter perfect as the butler Ferguson. And I'm sure Rene Auberjonois was happy to act without tons of makeup from his Star Trek:DS9 days in ""Frasier's Edge""

Jane Leeves' pregnancy forced the writers to come up with a ""fat Daphne"" storyline to cover her condition. Which leads to the strange episode ""Hungry Heart"" which Daphne is forced to face her expanding waistline. Unfortunately the tone runs counter to the attempted farce of the situation and is more uncomfortible to watch rather than funny.

This season also marks trips to experimental fare like ""Sliding Cranes"" which carries two seperate ""what if"" storylines without being confusing...or sadly, not being rather funny.  And more location filming with episodes like ""Hooping Cranes"" or ""A Day in May"". ""Daphne Returns"" starts of being cringe-worthy when flashback scenes are introduced (usually the sure sign of creative bankrupcy) when we see the current Frasier and Niles put into each scene, a very nice touch.

Bright moments include Martin's priceless reaction to Roz's secret in ""Semi-Decent Proposal"". Or Frasier's desperate attempt to keep his new love from reading a less than respectful email in ""Legal Tender, Love and Care"".

Overall, the Eighth season is also how I'd rank it compared to the previous seven. And while it's entertaining enough to keep ""Frasier"" from ""jumping the couch"" so to speak, it also has too many ""dramady"" moments of unnecessary seriousness (like Martin facing his shooter in ""A Day in May"") that reminds me of the latter, sadder days of ""M*A*S*H"".

Tidbits:

- Frasier's comment about the hairlength of a sci-fi nut in ""The Show Must Go Off"" seems rather out of character considering his hair was almost as long during the first two seasons.

- Jane Leeves missed five episodes because of her maternity leave.  She would become pregnant during the final season of ""Frasier"".

- Where's Bebe? Where's Bulldog? And why does Lilith literally ""phone in"" her performance in the final episode ""Crane go Carribean""?",1149984000,5,2990,5.087934560327199
2532049,5,B000ERVJMW,"I'm a HUGE Frasier fan, and have avidly been awaiting the release of the Eighth Season. Not one episode has ever been a disappointment. I look forward to more clever reparte` and the witticisms of the entire cast.

This is a MUST buy for any Frasier fan. Especially when we can look forward to more steamy scenes with Niles and Daphne!",1142467200,6,335,4.491803278688525
2532050,3,B000ERVJMW,"Season 8 marked a pivotal moment in the history of TV's most acclaimed sitcom. Following the sensational ratings glory of season 7 finale `Something Borrowed, Someone Blue (when Niles and Daphne finally got together) expectations were understandably high. There was unprecedented anticipation for this season, but that soon became an albatross weighing around the neck of season 8. The departure of two of the series' longest serving and most influential writers (showrunners Joe Keenan and Christopher Lloyd) added to the considerable pressure the production team faced this year. Jane Leeves (Daphne) also dropped a bombshell pre-production by announcing her pregnancy which forced some hasty re-writing. Many considered Daphne's weight gain storyline in poor taste but it's difficult to imagine how else the writers could have dealt with this without introducing a baby into Niles and Daphne's fledgling relationship. New showrunners Mark Reisman and Dan O'Shannon (whose previous work included `Cheers') certainly had their work cut out. On top of that the show's star Kelsey Grammer also requested that the show become more `Frasier' centred, the previous season having focused mainly on Niles and Daphne's characters. It was a reasonable request, but sadly it led to some extremely dull character-based episodes like `Frasier's Edge', which had one wondering if this was the same show responsible for the fast-paced high quality episodes of yore.

It's not all bad news. There are some genuinely entertaining episodes this year, including the hugely anticipated season opener `And The Dish Ran Away With The Spoon'. `Taking Liberties' saw the introduction of a butler to Frasier's apartment, `Cranes Unplugged' has some nice father and son moments for Frasier with both his father Martin and his son Frederick, and `The Show Must Go Off' sees a welcome return to the Frasier/Niles centred farces in which they try and stop an aging Shakespearean actor from making an ill-advised return to stage (guest starring an Emmy award winning Derek Jacobi).

Die hard fans will not want to be without this important and pivotal season, and there's plenty to keep the casual fan entertained too. For newcomers though, I wouldn't recommend this as an introduction to Frasier. Season 1 is the best place to start for any newcomer as unlike many comedies this show really hit the ground running. Season 4 would also offer a good starting point as it's crammed full of so many classic episodes it's almost a `best of' compilation in itself.",1141948800,77,2531,5.262376237623762
2532051,5,B000ERVJMW,"After ending season seven with a fan-pleasing twist, Frasier returned in its eighth iteration to fulfill it. This is the season that Niles and Daphne begin to date, and even though this development did take a lot of tension out of the series, it is possible that the writers felt they had nowhere else to go. Frasier proved an oddity while on the air: most sitcoms peak in their first two seasons and go steadily downhill after that, but while Frasier certainly had a strong opening, it had several renaissances during its run. This season was one of them, as it brought several surprises: Frasier having an existential crisis, Niles becoming a sports celebrity, as well as some others. In short, this was hardly a weak season and has more than its share of laughs.

Frasier's crisis manifests itself in ""Frasier's Edge"", which has Frasier reuniting with his old mentor (Rene Auberjonois of Boston Legal and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) and coming to grips with a feeling of emptiness. Funnier still is the subplot in which food critic Gil is primarily happy about being nominated for an award so as to avoid going to the annual awards show his wife throws when he's not nominated. The episode also starts off the joke about Daphne growing fatter in order to disguise Jane Leeves' real-life pregnancy. In ""Hooping Cranes"", Niles (almost magically) sinks a half-court charity shot at a basketball game and becomes a local hero, which, of course, causes Frasier to become jealous. The final showdown takes place over an arcade-style basketball machine and unfolds much as would be expected. Perhaps the best episode of the season is ""The Show Must Go Off"", in which Niles and Frasier are reacquainted with an aging Shakespearean actor (Derek Jacobi) who inspired them in their childhoods to delve into the Bard. In hopes of allowing their childhood idol to get over the heavy typecasting that came with being on a successful science-fiction show and get meatier parts, the two decide to put on a play and have him star in it. It doesn't take long to discover that the actor is horribly untalented, and then Niles and Frasier have to do everything in their power to sabotage their own production.

These are only a few of the highlights, but if you've enjoyed the show so far, chances are you'll like this. Enjoy.",1141603200,73,2309,4.784461152882206

Their feelings were finally expressed in season 7, and this season develops their wonderful relationship that would lead to their marriage in the next season. This show was a big part of the 90's and early 2000's, and there is yet to be a show that can be compared to Frasier.",1414368000,,378,4.573529411764706

I missed many of the episodes the first time around and am thoroughly enjoying watching all 11 seasons in order from the beginning.

He is perfect for that role and you gotta love that hair!  Jean Smart was a great choice for his mom and I love the mood swings.  The season got off to a very strong start with The Dish Ran Away with the Spoon. I also enjoyed The New Friend, Sliding Frasiers (very unique), Hungry Heart, Hooping Cranes, Docudrama, The Wizard and Roz, A Semi-Decent Proposal, and Passing Fancy.

2532576,5,B000ERVJMW,"Frasier is the type of series where you can watch a few episodes every evening and end the day on a happy note.  There is something about a family that stays together through thick and thin, even if they are not the every day family one would normally think of.  With all their wealth and success, they still portray all the angst and happiness any family goes through in a day to day life.",1404172800,,390,4.256756756756757
2532577,4,B000ERVJMW,"Like the old saying that the worst day fishing is better than the best day working, in the later seasons the worst Frazier episodes are still better than most else on TV. The glow of comedic writing and the mastery of the comedy of posture and expression (Jack Benny was an earlier master) by all of the primary cast makes up for some cheers tie-ins and tired plot devices in latter years. The episode where the brothers Crane become the shop class bad boys is one of the many gems of this season.",1402272000,,497,4.354838709677419

Christopher Lloyd let the series as director during the next 2 seasons, and I think the series got dark on some, extremely silly  - the episode with Niles and Frasier taking a car class was pathetic, and I almost gave up on the series.

2532678,5,B000ERVJMW,"Frasier is simply one of the best written, best acted, and best-directed comedy show in the history of television. Without overstatement, we can say that Frasier reaches that rare level inhabited only by shows such as The Dick Van Dyke Show, or The Mary Tyler Moore Show, in spite of the great difference the Frasier has from DVD and MTM. And, as anyone who has watched Frasier already knows, the comedy in the show is matched by moments of tremendous pathos and introspection. Be prepared for repeated and extended laughing fits, and stay on your toes because the wordplay on which so much of the show is based comes sometimes at a ferocious rate.

Frasier is a radio talk show psychiatrist. His brother, Niles, is close to Frasier, and the two seems to spend nearly all their free time together. Their father, a retired policeman, lives at home with Frasier, and is supported by a live-in health care worker, Daphne Moon, who hails from Manchester, England. That's all you need to know to get started.

Frasier was immensely successful during its 11-year run, pulling in an incredible 37 Emmy's over that time, a new record for a comedy show. It only takes watching a few episodes to see why the show is so critically acclaimed, and although you can enter the show virtually anywhere, it is best enjoyed by starting at the beginning on Episode One and then watching the shows in order. There is a fair amount of plot and character development over the seasons that really argue for this approach to watching.

And we can't help but mention that, as ever Frasier watcher knows, the show contains one of the most moving and emotionally powerful love stories ever seen on television. It takes nearly all eleven years for that story to come to fruition, but all along the way, that subtext is really something to behold. Be prepared to wipe away a few tears while you are at the same time hysterically laughing. Season Eight takes that love story to a new level, but its not over yet.

Frasier is a great show, with a great ensemble cast, and is an easy five star recommendation. If you enjoy witty dialogue, ironic humor, and double entendre, this is the show for you.

Note
If you think you are going to eventually purchase all eleven seasons of Frasier, you can save 30 or 40 dollars by purchasing the complete series, rather than one season at a time.

I really thought it was cool that they managed to tell you she had the baby without blowing the script line (""She's lost 9'12oz""). Overall, enjoyed as usual...will be looking forward to getting the next season.",1285372800,,457,4.9480519480519485
2532685,5,B000ERVJMW,"The season starts off with a bang; betrayal, frustration, carefully timed divorce proceedings, a new, young, hip radio station owner who needs a mentor and a pompous ass who takes on a butler, while Mel finally gets her unplanned moment of being dumped by Niles during Frasier's snooty pre-opera party! The series gets a shake down and shapes up for more hilarity! The fun continues when Dr. Mary, the bubbly radio show host returns to KACL and joins Frasier for the Christmas parade banter, live on TV but the icing on the cake is Daphne getting ever so large while Niles nor she seem to notice, instead they both blame the dry cleaners for shrinking her clothes and in a moment of truth when Daphne trips no one Crane alone can lift her off the floor but three, not to mention spending Valentine's Day with Daphne and Niles smooching sauce off each other; very funny and charming. Other highlights include `Frasier's Edge', where Frasier's self-analysis tortures him and shakes him up....a lot; the only episode in Frasier history not to end on a high note but a sombre one, also `Cranes Unplugged' where frustrated Frasier tries to desperately bond with his teenage son and a very frustrated Roz tries to hitch a drop-dead gorgeous surgeon who has a voice like a Greek God!  The `pieces de resistence' are when Frasier and Niles decide to coast through a mechanics course with hilarious results and when John Glenn joins the cast for space exploration and everyone goes overboard and the episode where Martin insists that Niles let Frasier back into the wine club; Martin's line `are you going to let your brother play?' repeated over and over till he gets results is comedy heaven! Also a very touching episode when Daphne returns from the fat farm. The season also hosts a well-written role for Jean Smart who returns in the role of Lana; in the vein of the season's tendency to develop characters we witness a very interesting relationship between her and Frasier as well as one of the most understated and creative episodes in the series' history is the touching `A Day in May', which beautifully tells the stories of three relationships; a sweet one, a challenging but charming one with a touch of realism and a sad and devastating one.

Meanwhile Bulldog and the rest of the supporting cast are unplugged for most of the season, except for Kenny who pulls a few punches on the show; the stories center mostly with the lead cast.

This season is formidable, epic in its approach and extremely entertaining; definitely one of the best in the series and a strong contender for the ultimate Frasier experience; it surpasses the sitcom standard. This season goes through many changes and emotions with fantastic character development. I only have one frustration; the writers present the best woman Frasier has ever met on one of the final episodes but choose to let her slip through his hands once again, it is a quite a torture they have put us through with Frasier constantly missing great opportunities...Season Eight is a true to form classic!",1280966400,3,3052,4.798479087452471

2532702,4,B000ERVJMW,"...tossed salads and scrambled eggs! I love Frasier! This season wasn't as easy for the writers on Frasier. They had to work in Jane Leeves real-life pregnancy, but that worked in their favor in the end since they were able to make it seem like she was just getting fat to avoid consumating her relationship with Niles. They padded her up nicely, too, so she didn't just look like they were covering up a pregnant belly - she looked bigger all around.

I liked the whole season, but it lacked a certain something - I think the decrease in Niles and Frasier's time together on the show has put a bit of a damper on things. Since Niles and Daphne's relationship progressed, though, it was only natural that it would happen.

Still, great season! I love the whole show, and I will always be a Frasier fanatic!",1218412800,,806,4.476190476190476

2532704,2,B000ERVJMW,"The first 7 seasons of ""Frazier"" are, truly, among the best television entertainment ever.  But Season 8 is where the cracks in the series' artifice begin to form.

To be fair, there are a couple of standout episodes:  Derek Jacobi as hammy Shakespearean actor, ""Jackson Hedley,"" and Illeanna Douglas as station manager Kenny's wife, appear in installments that are worthy of earlier seasons.  And, the scene where Roz breaks up with her French-only-speaking boyfriend, using Frasier to translate for her, is eye-watering hilarious.

But for the most part, the main actors sleepwalk through their roles, and the writing stretches their character development beyond recognition.

For example:  The scene where Roz, Martin, Daphne and Niles sit in the living-room area, and each character agrees to confess to something about his or her life that no one else yet knows.  Before her turn, Roz states that she's not sure if any of the others can handle what she has to say.  Martin counters by bragging that, as a former cop, Roz couldn't possibly say anything that would surprise him.  Roz whispers her secret into Martin's ear.  His eyes widen, then his jaw falls with a look of disgust.  He silently gets up and walks out of the room....Yup, you guessed it, that's considered a joke in Season 8.  But it's patronizing, and half-baked, and unfortunately, most of Season 8 is filled with scenes just like it.

At this point, the series lacks the brisk energy and skillful writing that made the first seven seasons sparkle. In other words, you receive 4 disks of episodes, but only half of them - at best - are worth watching.

Grudgingly, I give Season 8 the benefit of the doubt in terms of recommending it.  But it took me well over a month before finally deciding to spend my hard-earned money on it.

Season 8 will definitely be the last ""Frasier"" I purchase.  For certain, Seasons 9 - 11 are a waste of money.",1208476800,8,1911,4.774390243902439

2532760,2,B000ERVJMW,"Before you read this review, you must understand that there is NO greater fan of this sitcom than I.  The whole show has always made me split my sides, and I love the show more than any other.  Believe me, it is my favorite sitcom.

That was why Season Eight so seriously disappointed me.  The magic was gone from the cast this season, and I think that the choices made by the writers and producers were huge mistakes.  Frasier has a ""mid-life crisis"" during which he questions his career choice; every episode from then on shows a Frasier who is completely downtrodden and has no spark.  One commonly-cited flaw about this season was how the writers chose to deal with Jane Leeves' real-life pregnancy:  they had Daphne gaining incalculable weight, going off to ""fat-camp,"" and then coming back only to blame the whole escapade on Niles' love for her.  Needless to say, this put a damper on the comedic quality of all the Niles/Daphne humor.  'Bulldog' Briscoe was wholly absent from this season, as was Frasier's producer Bebe Glazer - and the void was glaring.  Martin and Roz were almost non-entities, blending into the background and not really bolstering the floundering humor.

The reason I am still able to love the show, despite this uncharacteristically poor season, is because I have seen what followed Season Eight.  The Final Season (11) is wonderful again, so I know that the show turned around eventually.  Hopefully Season Nine is again brilliant, and finds the characters having broken out of their individual funks.  While the show Frasier is amazing, and my personal favorite, Season Eight was the most disappointing of all thus far.  If you are a die-hard Frasier fan, you obviously need to own all the seasons, as I do.  If, however, you just have an interest in seeing some funny Frasier episodes (but don't necessarily need to see them all), this is NOT the season for you.",1157500800,39,1896,4.787692307692308
2532761,5,B000ERVJMW,"The glowing reviews are right on the money.  How ""Frasier"" has managed to maintain its excellence after so many seasons is a tribute to the stable of writers, the cast, and the producing team.

The highlight of Season 8 for me was the episode ""Daphne Returns"".  It wasn't the funniest episode but it was very touching and thought-provoking (always great sitcom ingredients, no?).  In this episode Frasier briefly turns shrink on his brother Niles and tries to examine why Niles' relationship with Daphne is in such a fragile state just when it should be at its most loving.  Niles must come to grips with how much of his love for Daphne is genuine and how much of it may just be idealization.  Mighty heavy stuff for a sitcom.

Season 8 is as strong as the best of the show's seasons.",1156032000,4,784,4.557142857142857

2532763,4,B000ERVJMW,"I have been a fan of Frasier from the start. It was  great, funny, and had what I like to call  spontaneous comedy. I continued to have this opinion until the end of season 8. After season 8, Frasier lost it's charm. It became dull and predictable. Almost like a broken record or a bad soap opera. Season 8 gave us one last chance to enjoy a great comedy with great episodes like the Butler, the Actor,the Lawyer, the dual Frasier where he gets turned down by his date infront of everybody. Glad that I have season 8. Final note: Frasier should have closed the curtain after season 8.",1153699200,6,584,4.348623853211009
2532764,5,B000ERVJMW,"I discovered Frasier on DVD and had the advantage of litterally consuming every season very quickly as I had never watched this gem on television.  And this season, in the opinion of some, was supposedly the beginning of a decline in the writing quality until the resurgence in full force of the last season.

Personally, I never felt any degradation of the amazing writing and acting this show always displays.  This really is one of the very best sitcoms ever produced, no doubt about it.  Some feel like the fact that this is the season where Daphne and Niles become a couple made everything less funny somehow but to me, this new twist in their relationship was very satisfying to watch and still works very well.

This season is very strong and even contains 3 of my favorite episodes ever, namely ""Frasier's Edge"", a moving episode where Frasier does some serious soul-searching about his life, ""Hungry Hearts"" where Jane Leeves's real life pregnancy was cleverly handled and Daphne comes to terms with her weight gain and last but not least ""Forgotten But Not Gone"", a hilarious episode where Frasier leaves the wine club to start a segment about wine on radio.

Those 3 episodes are to me among the very best of the whole Frasier saga and I found every episode very enjoyable, never feeling this lapse in quality certain people experienced.  Which goes to show that it's always a matter of opinion but don't hesitate to buy this one if you loved the other seasons. If you're anything like me, you won't be disappointed at all.

The only thing I feel is lacking in most DVD sets of Frasier is the fact that we never get any extras, although I felt like the package still deserves 5 stars.  Only a few earlier seasons had some bonus material but still, we never got any bloopers which is something I really yearn for.  I am sure it would be hilarious to see the actors break out of their characters I have grown to love so much.  It's a minor flaw because every episode here more than compensates for this but it would be nice to get some bonus with the coming seasons.

I still watch every season of Frasier very often and along with ""Friends"", this is my favorite sitcom ever.  Just for the acting alone, a very strong aspect of the show which goes hand in hand with the brilliant writing, this is worth watching over and over again. So if you liked Frasier so far, I don't see any reason why you won't continue to do so because this season is every bit as good as all the previous ones.",1153094400,5,2495,4.505543237250555

Of all the seasons, this one is the ""least great"".  But any fan would probably agree that a bad season of Frasier beats a good season of literally anything else that's out there.

The one thing I do miss is the littany of callers.  The series over time began slowly eliminating them so that now they're almost non-existent.  I used to test my knowledge by trying to guess what actor was posing as the caller before the credits showed it.

In all ways, however, you just can't beat this series for intelligent humor and endearing characters.

Anyone hear anything about the release of season 9?",1151193600,3,860,4.6118421052631575
2532766,5,B000ERVJMW,Season 8 of Frasier remains as wonderful as ever. Ok some of the tension is gone since Niles an d Daphne now are a ouple but there is still a lot of wonderful comedy. It remains a witty comedy series.,1150848000,3,200,4.025
2532767,5,B000ERVJMW,"Now with the eighth season of Frasier out now, there's only two more seasons to wait for arrival. Hopefully, by this time next year, all eleven seasons will be completely out on the market.

I must comment on the last gentlemen's remark about the CBS stamp on the packaging for Frasier. I'm not sure as to what that is, but I wouldn't be suprised if CBS does in fact own the series. Many shows cross-network like this for the benefit of money and publicity. For example, the show Friends was aired on NBC, but is a WB show (Warner Bros. just sold each episode to NBC each week). The only NBC show that I know for sure in our generation that is actually owned by NBC is the show Will & Grace as it shares it's estate with Lion's Gate. Paramount released Frasier and many of the shows Paramount owns are CBS shows (Touched by an Angel, The Honeymooners, I Love Lucy, etc.).

And on the subject of Paramount, I'm pleased with the release of this series as many of their other series' have problems or non-uniformed packages. While the first couple of seasons of Frasier are the only ones with bonus features, they've actually done a good job with this series in pleasing the audience rather than annoying the audience with mismatched sequences and packagings that only resulted in re-releases (I Love Lucy & Star Trek come to mind).",1150329600,4,1329,4.533333333333333
