8250863,5,B0013G8A0C,"This DVD is excellent. The footage is old but it's priceless. It is narrated in English but is a Soviet production. Most of the DVD contains footage from the Soviet air show in Moscow in 1967, celebrating 50 years of the Soviet Union. Lots of action is packed in this one hour DVD featuring Soviet aviation at its best. Briefly covers all of the design bureaus of the Soviet Union, their planes, pilots and stunts performed at the air show. Even commercial airplanes are featured along with women parachutists. Priceless piece of history for the historian or Soviet aviation buff.",1388102400,,580,4.81
