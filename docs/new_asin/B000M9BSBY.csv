2727635,5,B000M9BSBY,"Here are some excellent cooking lessons for making starches and vegetables absolutely delicious!
Mary is very talented in the kitchen; and Dr. McDougall's easy explanations of WHY eating this way is safe and good for us, and good for the planet, and good for the animals, makes this DVD worth owning.  He is such a cool doctor!  I use to live in Santa Rosa.  I had no idea his practice was there until I read it!",1392595200,2,412,4.394736842105263
2727636,5,B000M9BSBY,"We are so unhealthy here in the United States and this doctor and his wife have given hope to people all over. Not only does he tell you the reasons you should eat the way he shows you, but gives you great recipes! The seller of this video was able to ship it out quickly and it was well protected and came to me in brand new condition. They took the care to make sure it got to me and I appreciate it. I am learning so much from the items I have found and bought so far with Dr. McDougall. He is amazing!
I would buy again from this seller! Thank you",1377993600,4,551,3.8849557522123894
2727637,4,B000M9BSBY,Thank you!  Watching this I actually feel I can make this positive change. I've already tried several recipes and they're easy and delicious!,1366761600,2,141,5.130434782608695
2727638,5,B000M9BSBY,"I heard about the McDougall way last year and have been implementing his style of eating since then. Everything he says makes sense and first hand, I have seen the positive effects of his eating plan. My first week of eating the McDougall way resulted me in losing 4 pounds. That was without exercising and little effort. I just cooked and ate. Another cool benefit is clean up. Because there is no added fat, the dishes are a dream to clean! I bought this dvd so I could have live views of how to cook up some of the recipes (I like visuals) and have not been disappointed. Dr. speaks about such as issues as hypertension, body odor, disease etc. (which can all be reverses or minimized with a low fat, plant based diet) and then Mary cooks. Yum, the recipes are great and the Dr's words are insightful. I will admit that at first, the recipes might seem a bit bland but you will get used to the lower salt content of foods. I get so excited now eating plants because I know the positive effects this is contributing to my health and life. Highly recomment this dvd.",1306454400,9,1067,4.366834170854271
2727639,5,B000M9BSBY,"After reading a compelling book of scientific research (""The China Study"" by Colin Campbell PhD), my husband and I were thoroughly convinced that minimizing dairy and meat intake could significantly reduce our chances of getting Western Diseases (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, etc). Though we didn't have any of these problems (yet), we still saw health benefits within 6 weeks of minimizing dairy & meat so are hooked. But ""The China Study"" is not a HOW TO book. Thank goodness for this DVD ""McDougall Made Easy."" It is a superb HOW TO resource that put the ideas, methods and a few recipes into our hands for a much easier transition to this healthy and tasty style of eating. The DVD is divided into 14 segments.  At the beginning of each segment Dr. McDougall spends a few minutes covering a topic such as sugar, carbs, fat, dairy, meat, etc.  Then he goes into the kitchen where his wife Mary demonstrates a recipe.  The book ""The McDougall Quick & Easy Cookbook"" was also a great help because it has a lot more recipes. Now we're 8 months down the road and wouldn't dream of going back.",1261180800,19,1116,4.712820512820513
2727640,5,B000M9BSBY,"I have been on this program for 8 years and can say that this program works.  My health has been restored, I've lost weight and I am no longer on medications of any kind.  It's not an easy program because we are bombarded with majorly enhanced-to-be-irresistable (kind of like nicotine enchanced cigarettes), processed, filled with fat and health destroying foods that our bodies were never made to digest~~which are hard to say no to.  But if you want to change your life for the best health possible, this is a great program. And once you are detoxed from foods that will kill you, real food will taste great and not bland as one reviewer mentioned.",1241049600,13,651,4.643478260869565
2727641,5,B000M9BSBY,"McDougall rocks! I think Dr. McDougall has the answers to our health problems, watching the DVD's and reading all of his books, even the ones that are out of print or hard to find is so worth the effort. If you want to see your blood pressure go down, your cholesterol drop and your aches and pains go away - you've got nothing to lose by giving his program a try. You quickly become accustomed to a change in your diet. If you want to stay away from the doctor, get rid of your prescriptions and chuckle at the commericals for medications - you need to begin McDougalling. Life changing!",1199577600,10,588,4.3545454545454545
2727642,3,B000M9BSBY,"The product was attractive but the recipes, in spite of being told they were ""delicious"", were bland and rather tasteless.  I was disappointed.",1181779200,9,143,5.217391304347826
2727643,5,B000M9BSBY,"Fans of John McDougall normally expect his DVD's to be lectures about his program. You do get some of that with this DVD, but much more of this DVD is devoted to Mary McDougall demonstrating how to prepare simple and delicious low-fat vegan recipes.

The DVD basically has 14 short segments. John opens up each segment with a short discussion about some aspect of the McDougall program. Then he turns the program over to Mary who demonstrates how to prepare a simple recipe which has a theme related to what John talked about. Some of the 14 recipes are extremely simple, and none are difficult to prepare. They include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert fare. These are the kinds of recipes that you will want to use over and over again - basic comfort food for low-fat whole grain vegans.

The entire DVD has been nicely coordinated with the McDougall website. After listening to one of John's short lectures, you can go to the website and in just a few clicks transfer to one or more longer annotated articles John wrote on that subject. Similarly, you can quickly click to any of the recipes Mary prepares.

This DVD gives viewers basic information about the McDougall dietary program, and then shows them how easy it can be to practice the program. The integration with the website provides more in-depth information for those who want it. Overall, this is a nice example of how to combine DVD and web technology.",1171411200,31,1421,4.721774193548387

8167315,5,B000M9BSBY,"There are some eloquent reviews here, sharing why this is such a good DVD to have, so I will just say that I love the McDougalls and the generous and loving way they share their knowledge with the public.  I really needed this information so I could restore my health.  This is a DVD to help the newcomer find out how to get on a firm footing with this plant based, high carb, no fat way of eating.  It is a good way to learn as a beginner, and you can also review and see what more you can learn as you perfect your skills and understanding. I heartily recommend this DVD!",1470528000,2,573,4.098214285714286

I love Mary McDougall, and I love seeing how well these two gracious people work together.  The recipes are fast and easy and so much easier when I see how she does it.

Love the DVD but only half of the topics were on the disc!  Was so disappointed.
It did have a typed copy of the recipes in a folder on the disc, but I didn't get to see Mary cook those or hear Dr. John's comments about the health benefits.",1468886400,,534,3.990566037735849

8167320,1,B000M9BSBY,I purchased this thinking it was just a cooking DVD but there are very long introductions to very small cooking segments and there isn't an option to play just cooking segments or informational segments its all of nothing.  If you are looking for just a cooking show on healthy foods than this is not the DVD for you.,1448928000,2,317,4.4655172413793105
