8522650,4,B007WLV5R2,"I'm not in advertising but I've been a Sedelmaier fan since long before I knew his name. Who can forget classic spots like ""Where's the Beef"" and ""Parts is Parts"" from the 80's?  Marsie Wallach has put together a great documentary showcasing his creative process and incorporating thoughts from industry insiders and advertisers alike.

The only nit to pick is the lack of a commercials only section.  All of the ads shown in the video are part of the documentary and many have the beginning or ending chopped off (""Where's the Beef,"" for example, starts about 10 seconds in).

On the plus side most of the ads have been remastered in HD from the original film.  It's fun to see them with much better detail and color than they ever had when running on TV. Not so good are those transferred from tape.  There are jagged artifacts visible on the Blu-ray that look like a problem deinterlacing the SD footage.

In any case, this film is a must for any fan of Joe Sedelmaier's commercials.  Hats off to one the very few who could make you forget the show and long for the commercial break!

8522651,5,B007WLV5R2,"If you are in Advertising I highly recommend it. It will stimulate the comedic side of you. This gentlemen was a master at conceiving humorous gags, casting perfectly, exceptional directing, and finishing well. I highly recommend it for the marketing/advertising/creative person. For the general public you probably will find it amusing, but not necessarily a weekend movie!",1350086400,,374,5.578947368421052
8522652,4,B007WLV5R2,"While I agree that this program should be seen by people in the business, I was disappointed that there weren't more of Joe's landmark commercials on it.  I have an old VHS tape ""It's a Sedelmaier"" which has no fewer than 41 classic Sedelmaier commercials on it, and by my count, only 10 of those appear on this DVD.  (On the other hand, there are about a similar number of newer commercials that weren't on the tape.)  So I must add (with apologies to the late Ms. Peller), ""Where's the beef?""

I actually only rate the main program 3 stars; the 4th is for the added short subjects, which are quite entertaining.

I hope that the people who made this DVD will see fit to reissue ""It's a Sedelmaier"" on DVD, suitably remastered but otherwise unchanged.  You'll grin from ear to ear.",1302048000,,782,4.471830985915493
8522653,5,B007WLV5R2,"Coming up as a minor-league ad writer/producer myself in the 70s & 80s, I was weaned on Joe Sedelmaier's TV Commercials (Wendy's ""Where the Beef?""; Federal Express ""Fast Talker""; Alaska Airlines; GMAC and all the other great commercials that made me laugh and want to buy.)  For more than a year, I had been looking for something that told the Sedelmaier story.  One day, up popped a retrospective done by one of his former producers, Marsie Wallach.  Getting in touch with her to try and buy a copy, she advised that she wasn't sure the program would be released on DVD, but to ""keep watching.""  The DVD finally came out, and my wish came true.

I got my copy in the mail yesterday and watched it almost immediately.  It felt like it was Christmas Day and I couldn't wait to unwrap this gift to myself.

This DVD should be required viewing for advertising students and TV commercial writers, producers and directors.  While not everyone can be a Joe Sedelmaier-like genius, everyone can at least learn what he strove to do with each new commercial project.  Joe's commercials are sprinkled among extensive interviews: with the man himself, the CEO of Alaska Airlines (who commissioned so many great spots), Ad Age TV columnist Bob Garfield, John Moschitta (the FedEx fast-talking guy). and many others who were part of the Sedelmaier phenomenon - including Marsie Wallach herself, who worked with Joe as a producer ""during the day.""  In fact, Marsie because conducted the interviews with Joe herself, there's a comfort level that really opens the door on what made the commercials so great.  My only disappointment was that it wasn't a two disc-set, with one disc being nothing but Sedelmaier commercials.  (But securing the rights to those from all the companies, actors and musicians involved would have been a nightmare - so go to YouTube... you can see most of them there.)

Kudos to the creators on their own work:  the lighting, framing and even the split focus of the on-camera interviews were great.  (It's a skill to make a simple talking head head shot look so beautiful.)

But wait!  That's not all!  Also on the DVD are three theatrical shorts by Joe, all brilliant and award winners (Sundance and other film festivals.)

Treat yourself, buy this DVD, and laugh (and learn.)",1273622400,3,2287,4.832904884318766
