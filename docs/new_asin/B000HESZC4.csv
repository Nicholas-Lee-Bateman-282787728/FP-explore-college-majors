8139300,5,B000HESZC4,"After their ship sinks ""somewhere in the north Atlantic"", a group of survivors make their way to a -seemingly- deserted island. Upon arrival, they head inland to seek shelter. Little do they know, they are NOT alone! Of course, the group decides to split up, moving off through uncharted wilderness in several different directions. This proves to be unwise. When one man tries to dunk his head into a stream for a drink, his face dissolves off of his skull in gooshy fashion! Another man is completely skeletonized! Then, it gets dark, and the true hell arrives! The group is quickly under siege by tiny, shrieking puppet-men w/ glow-in-the-dark peepers! ATTACK OF THE BEAST CREATURES, aside from having one of the greatest titles ever, is imbecilic terror at its zenith. It wastes no time at all in becoming as ridiculous as possible. Its ultra-low budget is an asset, giving the cheeeze the unmistakable aroma of the finest limburger. AOTBC is extremely entertaining, making the best of its limited resources. The cast, though certainly akin to human-furniture, is fun to watch, especially when they die! I want a BEAST CREATURE doll for my birthday this year! Watch it, and you will too!...",1402099200,,1193,4.940298507462686
8139301,1,B000HESZC4,"Ha ha ha. I've only watched about 10 minutes of this ghastly movie, and already have a love-hate relation to it. ""Attack of the Beast Creatures"" might actually be *the* worst movie ever made?! Even the notorious Ed Wood was better than this (well, sort of).

The plot seems to be super-thin: a group of survivors from a shipwreck are chased, killed and presumably eaten by tiny cannibals on a remote island. The cannibals look like dolls, presumably because, well, they *are* dolls.

I know that turkey movies should be taken as, well, turkey movies, but I just can't give this brilliantly bad production five stars. Only one star, and please tell Mr. Wood and Lugosi I'm sorry for having dissed their movies in the past!",1368748800,,721,4.714285714285714
8139302,4,B000HESZC4,"Remember that story in ""Trilogy of Terror"" where Karen Black was chased around for 15 minutes by a spear-wielding 1 foot tall native jungle monster-man doll with sharp teeth? Well, if you liked that scene, then you may love this movie, which features an entire island full of hundreds of little buggers that seem to be close cousins to said jungle mo'fo'.

This low-budget period piece film tells the story of a group of people surviving a luxury liner shipwreck only to be stranded on an island full of the horrible aforementioned ""beast creatures""! Most of the running time consists of the survivors being gradually picked-off as they fend for their lives from an onslaught of tiny terror attacks! You will either find this film somewhat creepy or ridiculously hilarious depending on your outlook of such things!",1243209600,,814,4.9416058394160585
8139303,4,B000HESZC4,"Oh, man.  This has to be one of the most hilariously awful movies I have ever seen in my life.  Attack of the Beast Creatures has it all: nonsensical plot points, immensely bad acting, and incredibly ridiculous ""beast creatures.""  You would expect a ""beast creature"" to be some deadly, gigantic hulk of vicious animal; after all, it's supposedly much more daunting than a mere beast or creature alone.  Well, it's not.  That's probably why they attack in large groups.  Do you remember that scene in The Naked Gun where Frank Drevin is attacked by a bath towel?  I guarantee that scene will come to mind whenever you see the beast creatures go on the offensive.

Let's set up the back story before we deal with the vicious antagonists of this film, though.  It's 1920, and a shipwreck in the North Atlantic has left a handful of survivors drifting along in a rescue boat awaiting, well, rescue.  Their boat eventually washes up on the shores of a seemingly deserted tropical island.  Why a tropical island in the North Atlantic?  Don't ask me.  Now, if it were me, I would get me some signal fires burning and then hang around on the beach until the rescue ships arrive.  Not these guys and gals, though - they decide to travel inland to see what they can find.  They do need to find some fresh water, after all.  Here's a word for the wise: when you're on a strange, tropical island in the North Atlantic, don't assume that the first lake you come to is full of good, drinkable water and just dive in head first.  It could be full of - oh, I don't know - acid.

Things take a turn for the worse during the night, as the forest suddenly comes alive with the reflections of dozens of glowing white eyes.  Before the lookout can sound the alarm, the beast creatures attack.  Since it's dark, you don't get a good look at the critters until the next day, when what looked like sock puppets turns out to be miniature, bright red, wooden figurines with movable arms, long black hair, large white eyes, and vicious teeth.  Just the sight of these things is laughable enough, but you might well find yourself rolling in the floor each and every time they attack.  Basically, the actors (and I use that term very loosely indeed) have to hold these ""dolls"" up against their necks, chests, arms, and legs and pretend that they are being viciously attacked.  It is absolutely hilarious.

After a while, you can't help but start loving these beast creatures.  They're vicious little things, attacking from the trees as well as the ground, and they can sure enough boogity-boogity across the forest floor.  They're certainly more interesting than the human survivors trying to fight them off.  The film isn't incredibly gory at all, in case you're wondering, although there is some blood, one death (my favorite) by misadventure, and an acid bath or two.

Obviously, Attack of the Beast Creatures is a bad movie in every sense of the term; on cinematic terms alone, it's one star all the way.  On the other hand, it's so freakin' hilarious in its badness that it's almost a must-see for bad movie lovers.  Taking all of this into account, I'm going to give it four stars.  If you love bad movies, do whatever you can to track this title down.",1193011200,3,3229,4.5828970331588135
