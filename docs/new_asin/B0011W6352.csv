8440968,5,B0011W6352,"A few years ago, I emailed the BBC who made this series asking them whether I would be available on dvd. At the time it ran on PBS, I was too poor to afford the $80 for the vhs tapes. The series begins with the uber continent Pangea, illustrates continental drift, then starts with the east coast of the United States. As the series progresses west, we are shown how all the great mountain ranges were formed, the effect of earthquakes, and how volcanic eruptions are caused by the collision of continental plates. I was in awe of every episode. As I recall, there were six. I paid $80 for the two parts of Corridors of Time on a used vhs tape. So far I've been unable to find any of the others. I managed to record only the last two parts on vhs. I wish the BBC would make this series available again. So far, they haven't. This is an exceptional documentary, and not to have it available is a great loss.",1393459200,,906,4.242774566473988
