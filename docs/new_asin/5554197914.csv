205570,5,5554197914,"I saw this documentary on late night public television and was first struck by the wonderful landscapes and nature of northern Japan, where the documentary was filmed.  Essentially the documentary is about a snow monkey  named Mozu, who was born with severely retarded extremeties.  In a land  where a normally developed monkey has a better chance of dying before  adulthood than surviving well into it, Mozu is an example of courage and  struggle.  The film does an excellent job of conveying the fact that  monkeys and humans are both primates and, therefore, related.  One truly  feels for Mozu, whether it be during the bountiful and warm springtime  weather or during the painful and bitter winter freeze.  For anyone who  enjoys nature documentaries with a more emotional aspect to them this video  provides that.",914284800,6,819,5.06015037593985

7802441,5,5554197914,"This is a wonderful documentary about the many similarities between humans and chimpanzees. Even though this program is almost 20 years old (yikes, time flies by), it's still fascinating and is a ""must see"" for any monkey-lover. I'm writing this review for the VHS version, but for those who would prefer a digital copy, this program is also available in DVD format as part of the 6-disc set, ""Nature: The Best of Nature Set (Pandas/Bears/Dogs/Horses/Chimpanzees/Birds)"" (it is the second program on disc 5). This DVD set is out of print, but is available used. Note that the description of this DVD set on Amazon has ""1982"" in the title, but I believe that is simply a typo. In the specifications for the DVD, the release date is listed as March 9, 2004. The release year of this particular Nature episode is 1995 and it is indeed on the DVD set.",1394496000,,847,4.653333333333333
7802442,5,5554197914,Looking for a long time for this excellent heart rending story of courage and persistence.  We should all learn from this story of dealing with adversity.,1387065600,,154,4.923076923076923
7802443,5,5554197914,"Obviously ""Nature"" spared no expense producing this documentary series. It is one of the best documentaries about life and evolution that I have ever seen. ""Nature"" is the Gold Standard and nobody does it better. Every frame could be framed as a work of art.",1157846400,2,258,4.7555555555555555
7802444,5,5554197914,"Note:  This is a very interesting video for those who are interested in learning more about nonhuman primates and comparing them to us.
Different types of primates (chimpanzees, aye-ayes, baboons, macaques and bonobos) are featured throughout the video and are used as examples to elucidate topics such as development, culture, sociality, stress, intelligence, self recognition, and language use/acquisition. The scientific content of the video is very good and is based upon well established primate research. If you are interested in learning more about primate culture I would suggest viewing Jane Goodall's videos and reading her books. If you'd like to learn more about the topic of stress in human and nonhuman primates, I'd recommend books by Robert M. Sapolsky. If you're fascinated by ape language studies, I would start with the book on Kanzi written by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Roger Lewin. Kanzi is the bonobo featured in this video and uses lexigrams to communicate with humans.
I use this video in my Advanced Biology class (12th grade) and my students find it very interesting.  The parts about cultural transmission of behavior, the causes/consequences of stress, self recognition and language are especially intriguing to them and spark excellent class discussions.
One last point for all you primate fans out there.  Instead of calling the video ""Monkey in the Mirror"", I call it ""Monkey (and Ape) in the Mirror"".  During the part of the video from which the title originates, a macaque (monkey) is tested to see if it recognizes itself in a mirror and then a chimpanzee (ape) is tested.  I won't tell you the results because that is one of the best parts of the video, but chimpanzees are apes, not monkeys and I don't want my students to carry the common misconception that chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, gibbons, siamangs or prosimians are monkeys because they are not.  One of my pet peeves is hearing apes and prosimians being referred to as monkeys in movies and on television.  :)

7802445,5,5554197914,"I loved this program.  It is mostly about Arctic Walrus.  These two-ton saber-toothed giants spend half their lives sitting on ice flows hundreds of miles out to sea.  They spend the other half of their lives below the ice.  They may be clumsy on land but they are not under water, where they can be all too swift and deadly.  With the help of the Inuit people the film crew captures incredibly breathtaking footage of walrus, polar bears, the unusual narwhal with it's seven-foot long tooth (giving it the nickname ""Unicorn of the Sea""), a rare bowhead whale, and a massive Greenland Shark.
This program is a must for all Nature lovers.  Another great program would be the National Geographic video ""Arctic Kingdom:  Life at the Edge"" and ""The Geat White Bear"".  Both were wonderful.",989366400,4,784,4.7555555555555555
7802446,5,5554197914,"This program is a real gem.  I saw it before on PBS and had to get it.  I was delighted to find it was available.
Penguins spend up to 80% of their lives in the sea.  They are graceful underwater acrobats that move with the elegance that gives them the appearance of flight.  They must come onto land to breed and raise their young and have come up with remarkable ways to accomplish this despite the hostile terrain some of them live in.
The video takes you to diverse habitats where these remarkable birds live.  Go from the sun baked coasts of Chile to the blizzards of Antarctica, and from the Galapagos Islands to the suburbs of New Zealand.  I loved every minute of it.  So will you.",989366400,21,689,4.3359375
7802447,5,5554197914,"This is Nature at it's best.  This is a program about the real treasure of the Andes.  It is not gold or silver, but humpless cammels.  The llamas, alpacas, vicunas and guanacos of South America are the real treasure.  This film covers the natural history of these animals from the Inca rule to the Conquistadors and into the modern day.  These animals live in the high mountains with it's  breathtaking terrain.  Vicunas and guanacos roam wild and were hunted nearly to extinction.  Thanks to the protection of the National PARK Authorities in Chile, these living treasures are being brought back from the brink of extinction.  They now have a future as bright as their golden coats.
I saw this program years ago and have never forgotten it.  When I saw it was available I jumped at the chance.  So should you.  Another great program that would go well with this one is the National Geographic program Puma:  Lion of the Andes.  It is very well done and has some of the same type of footage.  Both are a must for nature lovers.",989366400,,1028,4.571428571428571
7802448,5,5554197914,"If you love nature programs you will love this one.  It was filmed in the national panda reserve in the ""Mountains of the Sleeping Dragon"" in China.  It features one of the most endangered animal in the planet, the giant panda.  There are over 100 of these animals in the area but their habitat is shrinking due to human encroachment.  It is hard for them to find mates and enough food to survive.  The panda must eat half their weight in bamboo every day to survive because it is so low in nutrients.  The program shows a pair of giant pandas mating.  They also show a successful birth to a baby giant panda cub.  The program also shows footage of the rare red panda and a bamboo rat mother and her babies who also eat bamboo.  I particularly enjoyed the footage of a salamander that can grow to six feet in length.  It lives in the streams of the area.  It was very short but very interesting.  I highly recommend this program.",989366400,4,929,4.337209302325581
