8631714,4,B00HDTQRS0,"Having thought this was a kick-butt series, the expectations were high when Aniplex USA released Vividred Operation in a subtitled format last Christmas (in 2013). The series is an uncensored format (recommended for persons aged 16 and up) of the popular anime series that was broadcast in Japan in early 2013. Though it is racy and male-friendly for the most part (such as the infamous ""docking"" sequences), however, the storyline and cast of characters (as well as Seiyuus) make up for that.

Product wise, however, I was somewhat disappointed that there weren't many special bonus features on the DVDs (except for the textless openings/closings, previews, etc.). I also had a little difficulty with the postcards included in the DVD because when you're holding them inside the case, it feels like they're making the DVD case ""fat.""

Nonetheless, this is a really enjoyable anime series. Though it may not be appropriate for younger audiences, however, Vividred Operation is even more vivid now than before.",1400025600,6,1009,5.184049079754601
