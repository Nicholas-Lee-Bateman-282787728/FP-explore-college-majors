8466809,5,B0056D9WSC,"Koike Teppie is one of my favorite Japanese actors.  He has an incredible ability to succeed in anything from a start of a regular commercial to a serious drama movie.  In this movie, he is accused of killing his mom (what a hapless boy) which put your mood in a turbulent state (knowing that Koike appeared always as a kind soul person no matter what type of character he is playing).  Then, after the truth is revealed, you can't feel but companionate and supportive.  My brother who is very manly in personality and appearance liked the idea of this movie.  The nice turn of event at the end was both surprising and rewarding.",1255910400,,629,4.530973451327434
