Never truly sympathized with any of the characters.

2451268,5,B000C05Y22,"I stumbled across this delightful gem of a film recently: as everything I've ever read & seen of Hardy is quite tragic, I was expecting quite the same from this...boy, was I in for a surprise!  This light-hearted romance comes from the usually gloom & doom Thomas Hardy pen: well-acted & filmed, this movie is a nice treat...

When Fancy Day returns to Mellstock to care for her father & teach the local schoolchildren, she creates quite a stir: the townspeople don't quite know what to make of this educated girl & the parson's plans to replace their beloved choir with her playing of the ""harmonia"" (organ).  Pretty soon the sweet & beautiful Fancy has attracted the eye of three men: a poor but handsome carrier, a rich but crass farmer and a gentlemanly but superior parson.  Her father urges her to marry well, but Fancy wants to follow her heart: will true love win out in the end?!

For those of you worried about content, it is kept to a few stolen kisses between an unmarried couple; there is also some time when a young man is in the river with his shirt off & he & a young lady steal a kiss.  There is some mild carousing, as a few of the townsfolk show up to the church a bit tipsy on cider.

I was quite impressed by this film: I kept waiting for the dark, depressing side of Hardy to come out & almost couldn't believe that the tone of the film seemed to be upbeat most of the time.  Surprisingly, the film stayed on the happier side & ended quite nicely: I love Hardy's other stories, but it is quite refreshing to see that he was not always doom & gloom, and could pen such a sweet & spirited tale as this!!  Highly recommended!",1147046400,200,1644,4.311688311688312
2451269,5,B000C05Y22,"UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE, published way back in 1872, is Thomas Hardy's first popular novel.  So many of Hardy's beloved novels have the underlying theme of forbidden love.  Someone is always in love with a person from the wrong social class.  Who could forget the bewitching Bathsheba Everdene in FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD and the spell she casts on three defenseless men (well 2 of them, anyway)? UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE is the charming and adorable story of Miss Fancy Day, the lovely and spirited schoolteacher who is hired by the town parson to teach the children of Mellstock.  And here again, a spell is quickly cast on three men.

First, we have Dick Dewy, the shy and handsome carrier (predecessor to moving van company) who is quite poor.  Then there is Frederic (Farmer) Shiner the wealthiest man in Mellstock (and Fancy's father's choice).  Last, we have Mr. Maybold, the arrogant town parson who feels very superior to his parishioners.

Music also 'plays' an important part in this lighthearted little story.  The church choir is constantly playing their instruments or singing.  They welcome Miss Day to the community by serenading her under her window.  They are also replaced--much to everyone's consternation, by Pastor Maybold's new harmonium (at the Church).  There are many parties and dances that utilize this little orchestra.  Even at the end of the film, these musicians again serenade Fanny in an act of contrition.  She has become very despondent about her future in this little village and when the band plays, she realizes that she truly loves where she lives.  In fact, upon being proposed to by Mr. Maybold, she retorts, (when told how superior she is to the villagers) ""As for me, I'm......I'm a woman of  Mellstock.""

We can tell what season it is by looking at the leaves on the Greenwood Tree in the little village.  It takes a year for the leading characters in this story to make major transformations in their thoughts and actions:  Dick Dewy becomes ambitious to win the affections of Fancy.  Fancy and her father also change...............farmer Shiner will be glad to change in order to acquire Fancy's affections!

I absolutely adored this little film (as I do Thomas Hardy).  Compared to Hardy's other works, this is a much lighter fare.  It still has the lively heroine and the great romance but we don't have to go through any of the great sadness and torment that we find in his deeper novels.  Hardy, who grew up in a town like Mellstock, took the title from a poem by Shakespeare's, AS YOU LIKE IT:

Under the greenwood tree,

Who loves to lie with me,

And turn his merry note

Unto the sweet bird's throat,

Come hither, come hither, come hither;

Here shall he see

No enemy

But winter and rough weather.",1146700800,64,2758,4.789808917197452
2451270,5,B000C05Y22,"This wonderful adaptation of a lesser known Thomas Hardy novel, aired on PBS last night. As the other reviewers noted, I too was not familiar with this Hardy novel and was waiting for the story to turn dark, as it dared to, many times, in this tale of a lovely young woman with three very different suitors. Keeley Hawes has been a favorite of mine for some time and she is wonderful here - with a terrific supporting cast. It's a very slight story, but carefully done, and it builds as it progresses toward a refreshingly romantic ending. I thought watching it, ""this is what most American movies are missing now - a REAL love story.""  There is intelligence - and heat - here - and I will absolutely purchase this DVD to see the behind the scenes making of the film.  It's a can't miss. A terrific love story, well played and told - and, for Thomas Hardy, a peak into a gentler side of him - unabashed and fiercely romantic. And did I say that I love Keeley Hawes - this is an extremely beautiful and sexy woman.",1145836800,10,1013,4.326315789473684
2451271,5,B000C05Y22,"""Under the Greenwood Tree"" is a charming adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel of the same name. And unlike Thomas Hardy's other dramatic and often tragic novels (think ""Tess"" and ""Far From the Madding Crowd""), ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" is surprisingly lighthearted and carefree.

It is a tale about a lovely young lady named Fancy Day (Keeley Hawes of ""Our Mutual Friend"" and ""Wives and Daughters"") who returns to the village of Mellstock to teach and care for her father. Soon after her arrival she catches the eye of three very different men: Mr. Shiner (Steve Pemberton), the wealthy and determined landowner; Dick Dewey, a handsome yet poor carrier; and Rev. Maybold (Ben Miles of ""Coupling"" and ""The Forsyte Saga""), the town's vicar.  Fancy's father urges Mr. Shiner's suite but Fancy cannot make up her mind. Should she follow her heart and marry the man she truly loves or marry the man who can provide for her and her father?

""Under the Greenwood Tree"" introduces some quirky and interesting characters and watching it is very much akin to sitting under a tree (greenwood tree?) and enjoying the breeze. Unlike most British period dramas that take several hours to conclude, ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" is less than 2 hours long and is a delight to watch. The story moves rather quickly and, as always, there are some misunderstandings and hurdles before Fancy finally makes her final choice.

I was especially struck by James Murray, who plays Dick Dewey with such charm, charisma and is so dashing that he almost outshines the lovely Keeley Hawes.  I had never heard of him before but you can bet that I'll be keeping an eye on him from this day on.  Ms. Hawes is always a pleasure to watch although this doesn't quite match her performances in ""Our Mutual Friend"" or ""Wives and Daughters."" Ben Miles, as always, does a creditable job as the solemn vicar.  There are some other good supporting roles, most particularly by Tony Haygarth who plays Dick Dewey's father and Tom Georgeson who plays Fancy's father.

I would certainly recommend ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" to fans of British period films. It is a charming little period piece that is a delight to watch. There are some wonderfully romantic moments and the chemistry between Fancy and her most ardent suitor is irresistible.  If you're looking for something fun, romantic and British, then this is right up your alley.",1145750400,17,2386,4.871604938271605
2451272,5,B000C05Y22,"The course of true love never did run smooth, and Dick and Fancy certainly have their share of thorns in love's path. The eligible bachelors of a small country village pine for Fancy Day.  Fancy reminds me of a 19th-century Lorelei Gilmore (Gilmore Girls) who is lucky enough to have all of the hot men interested in her.  Dick is immediately drawn to Fancy and is not discouraged by the class difference.  Fancy's father was the gamekeeper for the estate of his wife's family; his wife was spurned by her family when she eloped with Mr. Day.  Fancy is well educated and takes a position as the local schoolteacher.  Mr. Day encourages his daughter to accept the hand of a wealthy farmer, Mr. Shiner.  Mr. Shiner is sweet and well-intentioned, but Fancy feels no love or attraction for him.  I thought it admirable of Mr. Shiner to admonish Reverend Maybold to treat Fancy well or the parson will have him to answer to.  Mr. Shiner wrongly assumes that Fancy is in love with Rev. Maybold when she refuses his hand.  Fancy loves Dick who is loved in turn by a young woman of Dick's class.  Thomas Hardy critiques class boundaries and reveals them as problematic in a far lighter manner than he does in his other novels. I never read this novel; in fact, I had never even heard of it.  I'm used to downward spirals, thwarted love, and hanged heroines when I think of Thomas Hardy.  This novel is a refreshing break from the darker pen of the great writer.

Dick is so handsome and passionate (the casting is perfect in ""Under the Greenwood Tree"") that I can't imagine refusing him! The scenes between Dick and Fancy are filled with electricity and are even erotic in an understated way.  I love when Dick chides Fancy for lacking the courage to follow her heart and states that he would marry the lowliest milkmaid from the direst of circumstances if he loved her. Nothing would matter except Dick's love for the woman, even if he was a high-born, landed gentleman.

This short film is romanticism at its best.  As I said in my title for the review: it's so sweet that I can't believe it's Thomas Hardy! Not to disparage his bleaker novels, but I really like this softer side of Thomas Hardy.",1145750400,49,2190,4.548469387755102

2451276,5,B000C05Y22,"A lighthearted, high-spirited, and comically earthy yet not raunchy treat filled with Thomas Hardy's multi-generational life and romantic challenges and catalysts including caste inequities, enjoyably whipped up with olde world fairytale-like Ye Olde Village charm, electric romantic charisma and likeable other characters casting intimately filmed and satisfyingly reverberating with more thought-provoking depth than lighter fare period rom-coms yet surprisingly lighter than Thomas Hardy's usual, though still telescoping his large life macrocosms into small and deceptively simple microcosms.

My only critiques the dreadfully painted fake snow drifts (filmed in England, why couldn't this heavily English garbed period piece in four-season setting have used actual winter?) and the director's shift from Hardy's awakening young male hero to the young female's perspective emancipating them from rural into turn-of-the-century industrial Britain but this detour from Hardy's too much the director's proudly admitted copying Bathsheba Everdene and ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" instead of being true to Hardy's, making me want to read his novella and to look for an older version of the film to experience this idyllic time in England from a coming of age young Hardy's horizon.

Still, Hardy could not but be pleased by the beautiful and irrepressibly hopeful expectation of love, joy, and fun of youth and other passions too--surprising how rich the lingering takeaway, though should not be since it is after all a Thomas Hardy.",1506902400,,1532,5.744493392070485

2451321,5,B000C05Y22,"Who would have thought the old boy had a happy ending in him?  So maybe this movie adaptation of Hardy's second novel (published in 1872) is even lighter than the book.  I didn't care.  I'll take a Hardy HEA whenever I can find it.

Fancy Day comes to the village of Mellstock as the new school teacher.  She's young and quite lovely and has men lining up as suitors.  In particular, there's Dick Dewey, local moving man, Vicar Maybold, and the rich farmer Frederic Shiner.

Hardy originally was going to call this ""The Mellstock Quire"".  That would have been a very appropriate, but less catchy, choice for the name because of the importance of music to the story.  It begins with the village choir reveling and singing on Christmas Eve and the first meeting of Dick Dewey, as a member of the choir, and Fancy, newly-arrived schoolmistress.  Music continues its importance with the acquisition of an organ for the village church.  That's the initiative of Vicar Maybold, who decides to replace the choir with Fancy at the organ.

The romantic entanglements and the music/choir/organ plot line run nicely together.  Keeley Hawes is a delightful Fancy and James Murray is a personable Dick Dewey. (Although he could have used a few more workouts at the gym before his shirtless scene.  Yes, I am just that shallow.)

I've had this movie for a few years now and enjoy watching it every so often, especially after a turn with Tess or another of Hardy's tragic heroines.  This is a relatively lighthearted Hardy book made even more lighthearted in this adaptation.",1428105600,6,1560,4.786516853932584

2451352,5,B000C05Y22,"Thomas Hardy tended to write rather bleak novels even if they ended happily (which they usually didn't). But the one exception is ""Under the Greenwood Tree,"" a little rural romance about going with your heart.

And the BBC kept that frothy lightness alive in their 2005 adaptation, which makes the wildly underrated Keeley Hawes the center of rural romance in a small village. There's not much plot here except every single man being obsessed with the beautiful new schoolteacher, but the misunderstandings and fiery sexual tension -- as well as a subplot about a harmonium -- keep it moving quickly.

Beautiful and educated Fancy Day (Hawes) arrives in the little village of Mellstock to teach at school and care for her aging father Geoffrey (Tom Georgeson). Geoffrey dreams of Fancy marrying into what he sees is her rightful place, and she quickly has three devoted swains in Mellstock -- the cultured and ambitious Parson Maybold (Ben Miles), kind and wealthy Mr. Shiner (Steve Pemberton), and humble but handsome Dick Dewy (James Murray).

Also, there's this subplot about Maybold buying a harmonium, which infuriates the locals who have always made music in church with fiddles and choir voices. Maybold is kind of snobby and inflexible, so eventually they take matters into their own hands.

Meanwhile, Fancy begins to fall in love with Dick, but believes that they can't be together because he comes from a lower social class. But she can't bring herself to consider marrying Mr. Shiner or Parson Maybold, even though each would be an excellent match. Misunderstandings, rumors and stolen kisses complicate matters further, and Fancy must decide whether her heart or her head will determine who she marries.

There isn't a lot of plot in ""Under The Greenwood Tree"" -- it's pretty much about three men pursuing Fancy romantically, and her waffling about what to do. There are some subplots floating around, such as Dick wanting to expand his family's business so that he will be a better-qualified suitor for Fancy.... but for the most part, it's just the web of romantic issues.

So the TV movie is best appreciated as a pleasant little fluff piece, with lots of beautiful pastoral scenery and some picturesque village cottages, and plenty of scenes of dancing, fiddling and people drinking homemade cider. The comic relief is a bit tasteless (did we need farts and Mr. Shiner stepping on poop?), but director Nicholas Laughland knows how to provide a lot of sexual tension, including an oddly erotic scene of two people washing their hands in the same bowl.

It's also pleasant that there are no ""bad"" people in this story. Some of the locals do something wrong involving booze, but they're not bad at heart. The same goes for Fancy's suitors -- Mr. Shiner is a genuinely good, kind, sweet man, just not one Fancy is in love with; and despite the pastor being kind of snobby, he's genuinely in love with Fancy and wants her to be happy.

Hawes gives a magnificent performance here, and she instantly becomes the center of every scene she's in. Fancy is not a perfect person -- she can be a bit snobby at times -- but she's an endearing person who genuinely doesn't want to hurt any of her suitors. And she has brilliant chemistry with Murray, especially when Fancy flirtatiously hides his shirt and subsequently gets pushed over in the river.

Compared to most adaptations of classic novels, ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" is a fluff piece -- but it's such a pretty, endearing, with likable characters, pretty scenery, and Keeley Hawes. Who could want more?",1401840000,3,3563,4.90531561461794

CHEMISTRY alert!!! I'm a hopeless romantic, and I've watched my share of romantic movies and read my share of romantic books, always keeping a weather-eye out for chemistry. I've found it in a lot of works, and it's been completely exempt in others. The two leads, in this movie, were top of their class, and I don't mean the chemistry class I had to pass in high school.

I watched this movie on Netflix, a bit reluctantly - neither my husband nor I were sure it was going to be one we'd like. Boy, were we wrong. My husband, being less of a romantic, thought it was ""okay."" He did enjoy some of the funnier, light-hearted moments and laughed at those. Me? I loved, loved, loved it. I always think it's the sign of a great movie or book when I'm completely devastated that it has to end. I was NOT ready for the credits to start rolling.

I've not read Thomas Hardy, and I confess I'm not at all informed on his works, but the movie has for sure made me want to read the book. What a gem this movie was! I love the light-hearted feel of it, the quaint story-line, the characters, the setting, all of it!

But I won't give it more than three stars because of one decision made by the director.  Fancy is irritated because Dick misses her debut on the church organ, going instead to meet a potential business partner on that particular Sunday, showng a concern for making money which never troubles him elsewhere. We might feel that Fancy has some reason to be irritated  But, as Hardy wrote it,  Dick is absent because he has gone to act as a pallbearer at a close friend's funeral.  So Fancy's irritation is seen as a failure to understand the deep loyalty of her future husband's nature.  It was the kind of loyalty that Hardy prized. The moment is important for our understanding of each character. If the director did not understand this sympathy in his major male character, and lack of it in Fancy, and if he really thought thought he could excel Hardy by giving Dick a trivially-motivated materialistic reason for being away,  then I don't trust the director on other issues.  A man who doesn't understand Hardy should leave him alone.",1353369600,13,1188,4.7101449275362315

The story is relatively lightweight but has enough depth to it to keep most people interested.  The cinemotography is lovely; we see the Greenwood tree in all of its seasons.  The village life is pleasant, probably not very realistic, but nice for an evening's entertainment.  I enjoyed the choir, especially their last seranade under the window of the schoolteacher.

The cast is good, especially the very handsome and charming James Murray. Truthfully he may have been too slick and beautiful to play a village peasant but he made the film quite watchable. Keeley Hawes is fine as the schoolteacher who is pursued by three men although I found her a little lackluster, especially compared with Murray.

2451402,3,B000C05Y22,"Well, maybe three and a half stars. With two pleasant and attractive leads, Under the Greenwood Tree is very watchable.

But could the source material possibly be this lame?

Surely the romance would be improved if obstacles to love seemed insurmountable rather than inconsequential. It's simple enough: the higher the stakes, the greater the drama, and the more satisfying the climax.

Fancy Day has three suitors. But the pastor is unbearable and the rich man is a toad; so really, she has only one suitor. If the pastor and the rich man had been drawn as remotely plausible rivals for Fancy, there would have been a semblance of dramatic tension.

Issues of money and class are dismissed as if the story takes place on a college campus in 1980. But the girl's dying father has good reason to worry about her prospects in marrying poverty rather than wealth. In those days, it was a matter not merely of comfort but often of life and death.

Instead of showing a loving father who is concerned about the real risk of her marrying down, the screenplay wrongheadedly renders him grasping and deluded. So her risk is nonexistent and her father is a creep, and there's no real impediment on the road to romance. The young man's obstacles are likewise smoothed into nothingness.

All the ingredients for a compelling romance are lying in plain sight, and the 'creative' team has systematically chosen to minimize and discard them, one after another.

2451404,2,B000C05Y22,"I would suggest to anyone who has read the Hardy story or who respects the writer to avoid this production. It is likely only to disappointment and annoy.

The scenario writer tells is, in the ""Making Of..."" feature on the DVD, that he got his brilliant idea for restructuring the story from the plot of ""From From The Madding Crowd,"" even though the tragic love triangle of that tale and the comic, bucolic whimsy of ""Under The Greenwood Tree"" are worlds apart - artistically and thematically. The actor who players Nick the Tranter tells us, in the same feature, that his character is equivalent to the modern-day ""white van man,"" as if that would help him penetrate the part or give us a deeper feeling for it. Keeley Hawes - who, I suspect, will be the reason a good many will consider buying this DVD - tells us that she knew all she needed to know about her character from her name, Fancy Day.

Everyone associated with this production is at pains to tells us how slight the story is and how delighted they are to be dashing it off. Comedy is a serious art; plain needlework shows up faults; and this Hardy tale needed a delicate, intuitive interpretation that was willing to try to understand what Hardy wrote and why he wrote it the way he did.  4/10.",1297987200,8,1259,4.489082969432315
2451405,4,B000C05Y22,"This is one of Thomas Hardy's early novels, one I admit I have not read. If you, too, are unfamiliar with Under the Greenwood Tree yet familiar with Hardy, let me advise you that this novel has none of the darkness and heavy drama of his more famous works. Nobody is murdered, commits suicide, or is executed, for example. This is a sweet, light story of love in a Wessex village. Fancy Day, a native of rural Mellstock, has been away becoming an ""educated lady,"" but now returns to town to care for her aging father while also doing double-duty as the school-mistress and church organist. Her beauty and aura of relative sophistication make her an exotic flower here amongst the rustics. Like other Hardy heroines, her unsurpassed beauty quickly earns her three possible suitors: a rich farmer, a pompous pastor, and handsome but poor Dick Dewey. Class conflict is in evidence as the town's new pastor dismisses the church choir in favor of a new ""harmonium"" played by the elegant Fancy and some of the choir members vow not to go quietly. Fancy finds herself confused by her conflict of feelings versus duty. She is undeniably attracted to Dick, but her father is making quite a case for the rich farmer, and the pastor (though a terrible class snob) sometimes does seem to be the only person in town who understands what life is like for her. I enjoyed the sweet love story with its little twists and turns heading for a predictable ending. My whole family watched this together, and it had lots of humorous moments where we all were laughing out loud. This movie lacks depth and much real passion, but as an entertaining, light-hearted, family-friendly tale, it has lots to recommend it.",1296950400,2,1691,4.716216216216216

2451408,2,B000C05Y22,"This film has many elements that make it enjoyable enough to watch once--good acting, cinematography, sets, and costumes. Unfortunately, it has a flawed screenplay and directing. At the start of the story, my first impression of Fancy Day was that she is kind and intelligent and perhaps has some depth of character. My first impression of Dick Dewey was that he was extremely shy and backward. Then, without any real character development, everything simply changes. Dewey is suddenly anything but shy, and starts coming across as an A1 first class jerk who thinks he is God's gift to women. He quickly becomes insulted when Fancy doesn't immediately agree to marry him. At about this time, we learn that Fancy has very little depth of character and is, in fact, a pretty accomplished flirt and tease. While considering a marriage proposal from the wealthy Mr. Shiner, she keeps flitting back to Dewey, having a smooch, then running away again. What comes across in the adaptation is that Fancy is very excited by being able to charm the young, handsome, and (compared to the other men around her) very forward and romantically daring Dewey. Dewey comes across as having fallen for a pretty face and the idea of conquest. True love and a meeting of the minds is totally absent. The lead characters are shallow and unlikable.

As we began to see this ""romance"" unfold, my wife and I could not help hoping against hope that Fancy would come to her senses and marry someone else. Her best bet would have been Parson Maybold. Yes, he is a snob, but he would have been a better match for Fancy, who might have helped him come to appreciate the local villagers, and they could have worked together to help the village. Toward the end, when it is obvious that Fancy and Dewey will marry, it becomes a matter of them getting what they deserve. Absolutely nothing has developed to indicate that there is anything more in the relationship than surface physical attraction. There is not a shred of hope given that this educated woman who is not used to physical labor or the hardships of working class rural life and this working class illiterate man will ever respect each other past six months after the wedding. This is especially so since there is no reason to think that Dewey will not turn his head after the first pretty face that walks past him and Fancy will not flirt with the next man she sees with his shirt off. The ending scene with Fancy coming out to help with the wheat harvest does nothing to change this impression. She simply comes across as having no idea what she is getting into.

There are other problems in the plotting, as well. One I will mention is Dick Dewey's suddenly acquired desire, after wanting to marry Fancy, for more money and his idea to expand the family business. This is shown to be contrary to his father's wishes. Nevertheless, he uses his initiative to get a new customer. Then, this subplot is never developed further, but is simply dropped. What are we to make of it? I see it as an indication that Dewey will always feel inferior to Fancy, and his desire to ""better"" himself may cause continual friction with his father, who is content to stay as he is and not expand the business. But we will never know because the screenplay writer just let it drop.

There are also anachronisms. The most striking are the public displays of flirting and affection between Fancy and Dewey. These could never have happened in a 19th century rural English village without Fancy being perceived as the village slut and shunned by everyone. We may not agree with these standard today, but they were a reality at the time. I know that many screenwriters feel they need to hit us over the head with such scenes so we modern viewers get the idea that these two people like each other. But some of the best screenwriters, such as Andrew Davies (Pride and Prejudice 1995, A@E's Emma, Sense and Sensibility 2008, Little Dorrit 2008, etc.), know how to get the idea across without making the film out of synch with its setting.

If you are looking for pretty scenery, interesting supporting characters, costumes, and a quite story, this is worth one viewing. Rent it. The flaws make it not worth buying.",1275004800,12,4216,4.670255720053836
2451409,4,B000C05Y22,"Believe it or not, Thomas Hardy did write the novel, set in the 1820s, on which this light hearted story is based.  There is not a hint of doom, blight, or desperation, despite Hardy's usual flair in this direction.

This is a happy, light hearted story about an engaging, energetic young woman (named ""Fancy"") who has returned to her small village after obtaining an education.  She's returned to teach the village school so that she can take care of her father.  Fancy has forgotten some of the routines of village life after being ""away"" and her re-adaptation to situations and to assumptions and beleifs is part of the entertainment of this ""G-rated"" film.

She also returns to face a number of marriage proposals from ""eligible"" men, and the theme of ""eligibility"" vs. suitability is well represented.  As a woman with an education, the villagers understand that an ""offer"" must come from someone with an educated background, which, again, is more the focus than on similarity of personality or interests, never mind attraction/love. Would it be better for Fancy to be married (unhappily) and have some economic/social status or to be single, with few economic resources, but an existence free from loathing....or is there an unexpected romance ""under the greenwood tree"" that would surprise everyone's expectations?

I've never read the book, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The chemistry between Keeley Hawes and James Murray was evident from the beginning, and their romantic scenes were more than satisfying. I especially loved their second kiss in the woods when, right after it happens and before it continues, Dick Dewey (Murray) says to Fancy Day (Hawes), ""I knew you felt the same, Fancy. I knew it. I tasted it on your lips the first time I kissed you."" I mean, come on, that is hot! I'd want to kiss him again, too! You just don't hear lines like that anymore. And what is even hotter is the scene in the river with a half-naked James Murray. Now I know he's a little scrawny, but the faint ab lines and the wet bod are plenty tasty eye candy for me.

Aside from all that hot stuff, I enjoyed the classic struggle Fancy was faced with, choosing love or choosing to be loyal. It's fun to watch all the tension and the misunderstandings unfold as the end of the story draws nearer.

One, a well-to-do elderly business man, the other a well educated and somewhat pompous parson, and thirdly a well intentioned but humble and good looking farmer/carrier lad.

It is a great status reversal from that in Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre.
This film has so much pent up frustration in it that when certain scenes happen (don't worry they are all innocent) you would be hard pressed to want better. It certainly does not hurt that James Murray is painfully handsome and Keeley Hawes always makes for an attractive heroine.  The chemistry between Dick and Fancy is what I love best about this film.  It is about as physical as you can and still be faithful to the time and characters.

Even though the times were simpler, life could still be complicated.

The only thing I would comment on from the TV version vs. the DVD (to the best of my recollection as this is the first time I've seen it in two years), is that they show the greenwood tree more than I remember.  The tree does show the passing of time, but I think that the showing of the tree could be shortened ever so slightly.

2451424,5,B000C05Y22,"Having watched BBC adaptations of Thomas Hardy's Tess, Jude the Obscure and The Mayor of Casterbridge, I was delighted to come across an adaptation of Hardy's lesser-known work, Under the Greenwood Tree, which is not depressing as many of Hardy's other literary masterpieces, but is instead lighthearted and warm, and filled with the hope of romance.

Keeley Hawes [who was also in a memorable role in Wives and Daughters, 2002] plays schoolteacher Fancy Day, who arrives in the Dorset village of Melstock on Christmas Eve to take care of her ailing father. Her luminescent beauty captivates three men in the village - the young and down-to-earth but impoverished Dick Dewey [James Murray], the rich and arrogant Farmer Shiner [Steve Pemberton] and the ambitious Parson Maybold [Ben Miles].

The story is set against the beautiful background of the changing seasons as we witness Dewey's steadfast affection for Fancy, but what chance does the poor sod have when he has to contend with two rivals with much more standing and wealth than him? Will Fancy follow her heart or the wishes of her father [who wishes to see her wed and financially secure] or her wanderlust [which can be accommodated by Parson Maybold]?

The focus here is very much on the romance part of the story, but in Hardy's novel, there was much description of the traditional way of life in rural villages - which was eventually threatened and displaced by the onset of the Industrial Revolution. I had hoped that the adaptation would have incorporated this aspect as well but sadly, it glosses over this central theme in Hardy's original work.

Despite this shortcoming, this adaptation of ""Under the Greenwood Tree"" is still charming and quite compelling. It may be the 'frothiest' of Hardy's works, but it retains the love story at the heart of Hardy's work and Keeley Hawes does an admirable job of portraying the strong-willed and charming Ms Fancy Day who has to make an important life choice that will accommodate her own aspirations and inner desires. The cinematography is beautiful and so is the lovely score. All in all, another winning period drama from BBC.",1235779200,3,2139,4.966480446927374

The new school mistress attracts the attention of a wealthy land owner, a local farmer and the vicar.  Marriage proposals come from all three and Fancy must decide!

This film is chiefly about the beautiful and educated lady (Keeley Hawes) that brings change and a not a little chaos to the village - along with the 'church organ' she is intended to play. Of course the drama that ensues with the villagers over a beautiful new face is expected - a worldly and slightly haughty preacher, a rich and lonely farmer, and the handsome and wholesome poor man all vying for the prize. But the sub plotline of the film I found most delightful... was that of the village choir v.s. the organ!  Your heart goes out to the impoverished choir folk, being pushed aside for progress - their music brings an earthy whimsical tone to this story.

All in all, the film was a delight. The scenery is breathtakingingly rustic yet lush - while the acting of each character really rounds out each town personality. You will fall in love with the choir-folk and praise Miss Fancy Day for her appropriate struggle to choose love for ""father's wishes"" or for love's sake.

Fancy Day (her name alone should tell you this is a fairy tale) turns down a wealthy tradesman who can give her comfort and the parson who can show her the grand cities of Europe to marry a man who can't even afford to give her a place of her own.  Yes that's right, she chooses to live in a dirt floor cottage with his parents and siblings.  Ridiculous.  And we're supposed to believe that these poor uneducated folk are the happiest and best of people.  Hmmm.  I suppose that would be like choosing to marry someone from Harlem and moving into his parents cramped space in the projects.  There are similar ridiculous elements.
But, if you can suspend all intelligent thought, and provided you don't mind the lack of fancy gowns and grand rooms, this is a pretty little romance.",1223942400,,987,4.556818181818182

Thomas Hardy, master of the nineteenth-century rural English gloom and doom novel, penned a sweet, uplifting romance in Under the Greenwood Tree.  Skillfully adapted to the screen, this tale that originally centered around local young man Dick Dewy, is now recast with Fancy Day (Keeley Hawes) as the central figure and with the three men who love her secondary.  It works very well and creates a bit of charm in an otherwise simplistic tale of rustic romance in a small Dorset village (though the film was entirely shot on the Isle of Jersey) amid the changes hinted at by the impending Industrial Revolution.

It is the story of Fancy, a schoolmistress who returns to the village of Mellstock.  She is young, beautiful and educated, and the villagers don't know what to make of her.  Handsome Dick Dewy (James Murray), a workingclass lad, is instantly smitten as are nouveau riche farmer Mr. Shiner (Steve Pemberton) and the local vicar, Parson Maybold (Ben Miles).

Fancy feels a need to honor her father and marry well, but in the course of events she falls in love and must choose between following her father's wish or following her heart.

Beautiful photography and authentic scenes and costuming add to the charm of this lighthearted adventure.

Miss Fancy Day (Keeley Hawes) is a new arrival in Mellstock, where she becomes the new schoolmistress.  Her arrival causes dismay among the Deweys, members of the church choir who are replaced by Day and the vicar's new organ.  Well, all members of the choir are upset except for the very handsome Dick Dewey (James Murray).  He and Miss Day develop feelings for each other, but his humble upbringing makes him less than a desirable suitor.  Dick has a lot of competition, for Miss Day has other suitors, like wealthy landowner Mr. Shiner (Steve Pemberton), the only one Mr. Day approves of, and the village vicar Reverend Maybold (Ben Miles).  She receives marriage proposals from all three men.  Will she do what is expected of her, or will she follow her heart?

This is considered to be Thomas Hardy's more lighthearted novel.  I have always enjoyed the aforementioned Victorian love story's simplicity and charm.  This BBC adaptation has captured all of the things that made the book endearing.  One cannot help but feel envious when the heroine is being wooed by two very hot men.  (I know there are three suitors, but Mr. Shiner is quite old and not so very good looking.)  The production quality is top-notch, and the simple wardrobe and sets are easy on the eye.  Keeley Hawes, who I had seen in BBC's Wives and Daughters, does a wonderful portrayal of the beautiful, innocent and irresistible Fancy Day.  She manages to capture Day's torn feelings of duty vs. desire.  So many other actresses would have come across as a woe-is-I-beautiful-woman-courted-by-so-many-handsome-men sort, but Hawes handles the role with grace and dignity.  I enjoyed Ben Miles as the handsome local vicar.  He played the role of himbo Patrick in the former BBC sitcom Coupling.  I enjoyed seeing a different side of this actor.  And I am very impressed with James Murray.  He is gorgeous and oh so charismatic!  He is also quite talented and adds such a romantic touch to the characterization that I couldn't picture someone better playing the part of Dick Dewey.  I enjoyed this wonderful film.  However, it is too short, only 90-something minutes long.  That is why I take away a star.  Other than that, this is a production like only the BBC could create and it will be kept on my ever-growing DVD shelf to be watched again and again.  I recommend this gem.",1160870400,8,2725,4.777301927194861
2451468,5,B000C05Y22,"This was a short (90+ minute) period drama that was a joy to watch.  The filming (all done on rural Jersey Island off English coast) truly captured the ambience of a small village in the 1840's.  The four seasons through which the story progresses are captured subtly yet convincingly through the snow, spring flowers, summer sunshine, and fall harvest/falling leaves.

If you like period drama and romance, but only have a single evening to devote to it, this is the perfect movie!",1159401600,4,482,4.853658536585366

But this movie has a happy ending.
