684240,4,6303588972,"THE BRIDE isn't really a horror film.  It plays like a twisted ""Pygmalion"", a dark fairytale that is quite beautiful in it's design and look.

Dr Frankenstein (Sting) creates a female companion for his original monster (played by Clancy Brown).  Things go wrong when the monster reacts violently and the lab becomes engulfed by flames.  The monster escapes and 'Eva' is left in the care of Frankenstein.

The rest of the film focuses on the 2 separate adventures of Eva and the monster.  Jennifer Beals is luminous as Eva, a woman who somehow knows she is different and is always searching for answers.  Sting plays Dr Frankenstein with all the pomp and circumstance he can muster, and suits the time period of the film perfectly.  Clancy Brown gives 'Viktor' the monster a humanity and heart, and David Rappaport, as Viktor's tiny friend, is a real scene-stealer.  Geraldine Page is wasted as Frankenstein's remote housekeeper.

The music by Maurice Jarre of DOCTOR ZHIVAGO fame is lush, and the scenic design is haunting (especially the eerie huge statues that Eva and Frankenstein ride past in the woods).  Direction by Franc Roddam is perfectly-pitched.

Not your average horror film.",1108425600,28,1188,5.005102040816326
684241,3,6303588972,"...but the movie isn't bad. Not at all. But I am a Sting-fan, and unless I probably wouldn't have bought this one. As mentioned one shouldn't expect Coppolas' Dracula, but The Bride could have been a lot worse than it is. Stings' acting suits the Frankenstein-character, and the relationship that builds up between Frankensteins' monster and the midget is moving, the chemistry between these two actors works very good, and somehow lifts the movie. The story is ok I think, but ""The Bride"" is perhaps no classic (not in my collection anyway) -but of course it is a must-have for Sting-fans, check it out!",1097712000,3,604,4.8173076923076925
684242,5,6303588972,"I hadn't seen any of Jennifer Beals' early films when I watched THE BRIDE just the other night. From her more recent work (FOUR ROOMS, THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY and now THE L WORD), I know she is a first-rate actress, but didn't know what to expect from her beginning work (I still have to see FLASHDANCE.) Though I've read critics' reviews panning this film, I think THE BRIDE is quite good and deserving of the regard other ""undiscovered"" or ""underground"" films receive.

The story is straightforward enough: The infamous mad scientist Frankenstein creates a mate for his ""monster"" (whom will later be named Viktor). Things go wrong, however and Eva is left at the hands of Dr. Frankenstein (Viktor having run off when fire breaks out in the lab).  Frankenstein (played to irritatingly perfect pompousness by Sting) has Eva all to himself and attempts to make her into a ""proper lady.""

The plot is not the main reason to watch this endearing movie, though it definitely keeps your interest with the main plot and the storyline involving Viktor after he flees the fire and meets up with a wonderful character played by David Rappaport. No, the real reason to watch is in the little touches, whether it be the memorable scene where Eva (played with incredible innocence and searching curiousity by Jennifer Beals) snarls at a cat during her first outing at a fancy dinner to meet the ""important"" people or the tender friendship between Viktor and Rinaldo.

I don't want to reveal too much about where the movie goes but it does a surprisingly good job of capturing universal themes such as loneliness and searching for one's own roots. A big plus in its favor is that it comes closer to the original intent of Mary Shelley's novel than the old Hollywood versions and reminds us that Shelley's novel was never really about scary horror but the horrors in our fellow humans' behavior and our own isolation.",1081900800,5,1901,4.786585365853658
684243,4,6303588972,"First of all, this isn't at all close to anything from the original novel by Mary Shelley. In the book, work begins on a bride for the creature, and is then abandoned, which leads to all sorts of unpleasantness. This film is sort of a exploration of how the story might have developed if work on the creatures mate had continued. Sting, of the Police, plays the Doctor, and Jennifer Beals plays his second creation. Obviously, his skills have improved from his first effort, however an accident in the lab leads to a fire, and the loss of the first creature, or so he believes. He then sets out to educate her as a continuing experiment. Meanwhile, the first creature is being educated by different experiences as he wanders the countryside, eventually befriending a dwarf who helps him find employment. Eventually, the creature and his intended bride cross paths again...with results which are perhaps unexpected, given their different backgrounds. This is perhaps the only Frankenstein film with an positive ending, attempting to show that even artificially created humans might have a soul, or a spirit, which seeks to rise above the limitations of the flesh.  The set design of the film was good, especially 'the masoleum'. Jennifer Beals is gorgeous as 'The Bride', and the performance by Clancy Brown as the 'creature' is also good, as is David Rappaport as the dwarf. I enjoyed it. Ron",1058054400,5,1392,4.898305084745763
684244,4,6303588972,"In 1985 when both Sting and Jennifer Beals were huge draws, this movie was created: A retelling of The Bride of Frankenstein.  On a dark and stormy night, Baron Frankenstein works feverishly in his lab trying to bring to life the agreed to Bride of the monster previously created.  Sting, as Frankenstein, is intelligent, determined, and methodical.  He brings to life his newest creation and quickly discovers that the mistakes he made when creating the man have been corrected, bringing to life a beautiful woman.  Upon seeing his bride, the monster (Clancy Brown)inadvertently hurts her.  Frankenstein strikes the monster and removes the bride from the creature's grasp.  A fight ensues and the monster flees into the night.  The next day Frankenstein names the woman Eva and decides to teach how to be ""as bold and as proud as a man.""  Meanwhile, the creature runs into a little person named Renaldo (David Rappaport) who understands what it is like to be an outcast and befriends him.  As the movie progresses, we see two stories take place.  Eva becoming ""the new woman"" and the creature learning about life and friendship.
I have always enjoyed this movie.  Sting is great as Frankenstein and plays him with a hint of madness that such a man would likely have been.  Jennifer Beals plays Eva with childlike innocence early on then shows the maturity of a bold, intelligent woman, but still she is disturbed about who she truly might be.  (Check out the scene when she does discover the truth.  Fantastic!)  Clancy Brown, too, shows growth and maturity in the development of the creature (later named Victor by Renaldo) from clumsy, confusion to brave determination.  Cary Elwes has the role of Josef, one of the Countess' guards.  And how can we forget the late David Rappaport as the compassionate and insightful Renaldo.  Through him we see the pain and prejudice he faces by being a little person.
The extras on the DVD are few, but nice to have.  I don't recall ever seeing the trailer before so having it on the DVD was a plus.  The Director's commentary could have been better.  He admitted that it had been so long since he had seen the film.  Knowing this, he should have watched it a few times and made notes.  As it was, he forgot a lot of the information.  Later in the film, he would comment that the movie never addressed this or never addressed that when in actuality, the movie had established those things earlier in the movie.  To me, a great commentary is when the person commenting on the film is discussing the scene: either the actors or the background, or something relevant.  This director sometimes went on little tangents that had nothing to do with the movie at all.  I kept thinking ""can we please talk about this movie?""  There was some good information though about the French scenery, how Sting got the role, the relationships between the actors, and the loss of David Rappaport.  So the commentary wasn't a total loss, but could have been better if the Director was better prepared.",1006992000,13,3020,4.753846153846154
684245,3,6303588972,"Thank goodness for the current DVD boom.  It seems that all the major studios, in a rush to get product on the shelves, are in the process of scouring through their back catalogues and releasing everything and anything available.  The ""Midnite Movies"" series from MGM is a perfect example.
  So likewise, Columbia has released The Bride on DVD.  True, it is NOT a horror film, and yes, a musician is in the lead role(always a dubious casting move), but it does succeed on many levels.  This retelling of The Bride of Frankenstein works more as a romantic fantasy, and the narrative chugs along at quick, engrossing pace, especially the sub-plot of Victor(the Monster) and Rinaldo.  The many poignant moments between these two and the child-like demeanor of Victor gives the movie its soul.  That said, the ending is a bit of a dissappointment, which the director freely admits to on the commentary track, which is filled with relevant and amusing anecdotes about the film itself.
  So if anyone remembers this eighties artifact fondly, I say its a worthy addition to your collection.  And listen to the commentary!",1005955200,7,1114,4.903743315508021
684246,3,6303588972,"This film is actually two-in-one!  The first film is a very good one, the second, a dull, lifeless (no pun intended) one. The first ten minutes of THE BRIDE are fascinating and magnificently staged.  But it is when the  monster leaves Dr. Frankenstein's castle that the film takes on its split  personality.
The first film, the good one, tells the story of Rinaldo, a  dwarfed circus perfomer, who meets up with Frankenstein's creation.  Rinaldo christens the creature Viktor and the two become close friends.  They make their way towards Budapest to join the circus.  Their story is  excellently told with humor and pathos.  It's the kind of pathos that made  the original BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN such a memorable film.
However, the  film zig-zags back and forth between this story and the tale of the good  doctor's efforts to create the perfect ""modern"" woman.  In mind  as well as body, he ""teaches"" her in an incoherent and completely  uninteresting series of scenes, that give the film a choppy look.  For  nearly two hours we go back and forth between good filmmaking and  bad.
Sting does what he can with his poorly written scenes, but quite  frankly I expected more.  At least he tries.  Jennifer Beals, on the other  hand is atrocious, going through her dialogue like Hulk Hogan doing  Shakespeare.  She proves once and for all that not only can't she dance  (most of her choreography in FLASHDANCE was done by somebody else), she  can't act either.  Geraldine Page, a magnificent actress, looks like she  wishes she were somewhere else.
But David Rappaport as Rinaldo and Clancy  Brown as Viktor shine in their roles.  In fact everything in THE BRIDE that  is good is in their half of the film.  Everything that is except the sets,  costumes and music score.  In these areas the entire film is  excellent.
If you watch the film you will stick with it until the finale  so I won't give away the ending.  But unless you like your coffee with  Half-and-Half instead of whole cream stay away from THE BRIDE.",956534400,9,2012,4.738372093023256

684343,3,6303588972,"This take on the ""Frankenstein"" story was okay...for many of you out there that recognize Sting from back in his heyday as a singer-songwriter (remember Synchronicity? Ring any bells? Okay, some people will really get a kick out of this bizarre adaptation of the Frankenstein story...Um, unless you are really sensitive about feminism. If Sting was trying to portray his character as a tyrannical, arrogant, giant @$$) well, he NAILED it! Long story short. Dr Stingenstein creates the monster. Then the Dr. promises his monster a wife. So he, creates a monster-mate... But Stingenstien really out does him self. She turns out to be a real knockout-gorgeous-woman that is totally innocent. A blank slate. She is the perfect woman. So, Dr. Stingenstien, welches on his promise and keeps Babestien for himself and kicks Ol' Bolthead out on his ear! This timeless classic is...different, not great, but okay. Honestly I watched this one because I am trying to find another particular version from the late seventies? But I can't seem to find it. For the life of me I can't remember the actors name that played the ""monster"" in the one I'm looking for.

I guess that pretty much everything from the 80's had it fair amount of cheese, but if you can get around that, it was enjoyable.

684466,3,6303588972,"Doctor Frankenstein has finally created the perfect woman, but in his selfishness, he keeps her for himself and spurns the disfigured monster that he had promised a mate. After being cast aside by his creator, the newly-renamed Viktor befriends a rogue dwarf named Rinaldo as the two set out to create a new life for themselves in Budapest. Meanwhile, Frankenstein attempts to shape the beautiful Eva into a modern woman, but his hidden desires and lack of control over her will lead to his final undoing. Sting stars alongside the lovely Jennifer Beals in 1985's THE BRIDE, a romantic re-imagining of THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Director Franc Roddam quickly divides the separate storylines, but finds difficulty in striking a balance between the two. Despite the title, we spend the majority of the film following Viktor and Rinaldo on their journey to join the Budapest circus, a friendship that is greatly built upon by Clancy Brown and David Rappaport's interactions on screen. Sting appears to be holding back as Frankenstein, delivering a bland performance that lacks raw emotion. Jennifer Beals, on the other hand, makes for a wonderful Bride, shouting ""You didn't create me! You didn't create ME!"" in an impassioned response to Frankenstein's claims over her. Michael Seymour's lavish production design wins out over all.

But everything I've ever seen him in, he gives his all.  In this atmospheric and compelling film he gives such a wonderful performance as Viktor, the creature that Frankenstein (Sting's character) brought to life in a laboratory.

684468,5,6303588972,"The film begins in the lab of Baron Von Frankenstein. However, the bride created is a beautiful, young woman.

The man created earlier by Baron Frankenstein only shows a hint of being a man-creation in the first scene when his stitches have not yet healed. However, by the second scene the man-creation is all healed up, and is just a big, strong, child-like, man, who fits in fine with the public.

Baron Frankenstein decides to keep the beautiful young, woman-creation for himself, and so drives the man-creation away. The man-creation has interesting adventures on the road, making fast-friends with a wise, dwarf. The wise, dwarf needs the man-creation's physical-strength and protection, and man-creation needs the dwarf's wisdom. They join forces and join the circus.

Baron Frankenstein educates the young, woman-creation with the hope of making her his bride in years to come; but she has a mind of her own.

Filmed on location in a castle and countryside of Europe. Beautiful music. Beautiful costumes and fanciful sets in the style of Hammer films.

Well into the film; you think there could not possibly be a good love-story here, but a good, love-story does surprisingly, emerge later, and a story of true friendship.

Instead of allowing her to mate with his male creation, he decides that he must have her for his own.  The enraged creature (Clancy Brown) destroys the tower laboratory and flees.  What follows is a touching, warm-hearted relationship between him and Rinaldo, a  midget (David Rappaport) he rescues from children who are teasing him.  The two misfits develop a close friendship and decide to travel to Budapest to join the circus.  Rinaldo gives his friend the name of Viktor.  Meanwhile, Baron Frankenstein names his female creation Eva (the gorgeous Jennifer Beals of ""Flashdance"" fame).  Refusing to believe she was simply found in the woods, Eva becomes increasing more agitated as she searches for her true identity.  Somehow, she shares a psychic bond with Viktor.  They can feel each other's pain.

  ""The Bride"" is a beautifully photographed gothic film with lush settings and costumes and a great musical score composed and directed by Maurice Jarre.  It deals primarily with the strong bond of everlasting friendship.  Also, it emphasizes the timeless theme found in ""Beauty and the Beast"" - true beauty comes from within.  You can be hideously scarred on the outside and still have a beautiful heart.  This version of Frankenstein has one of the most happiest endings I have ever seen.  Baron Frankenstein, as usual, is greedy and selfish and it was fun to watch him receive his just reward.  However, those he has harmed escape his evil clutches and are given a chance to make their dreams come true.

Since I was a kid I didn't pay much attention to the story, just the adventure. As I grew older I became more attached to the characters and their situations. To this day Rinaldo's death is the most heartbreaking and dramatic scene I've ever seen on film. You can't help but to think about someone close in your own life that you've lost when seeing this part. Oscar nods should have been made to David Rappaport and Clancy Brown based on this scene alone. In the end, Viktor does become ""human"" and redeems himself and his bride.

684523,2,6303588972,"This movie is quite obviously intent on being a ""serious ""version of the Frankenstein story .It comes across as dull and earnest and is marred by an excessive pomposity in script and overall treatment .In striving to be weighty it merely comes over as dull and stilted
Baron  Charles Frankenstein (Sting)has already created his male creature (Clancy Brown)when the movie starts and he is looking to make a mate for him ( Jennifer Beals) .As she is brought to life the laboratory explodes and she is carried to safety by Frankenstein who wrongly assumes that the male has perished in the fire .Quite obviously the good Baron has improved his skills considerably between making the male creature and building the woma -he is the archetypal  Frankenstein monster while she is a stunner .He decides to keep her for himself and raise her as a sort of Pygmalion experiment -he will create an educated ,  independent ,free spirited ""new woman"" (rather like Mary Shelley the author of the source novel).He names her Eve -the first woman- and tells her that she is an amnesia victim he found wandering in the nearby woods .

The movie proceeds to cut between Eve and the male monster .He has escaped from the fire and is wandering the roads where he meets a dwarf (David Rappaport)and they strike up a friendship eventually joining a circus and becoming moderately successful and the monster assumes the name Viktor .Things go wrong when the dwarf is murdered and Viktor takes it upon himself to avenge his death and is forced to go on the run. The two creations gradually find their way to each other and even develop a telepathic link with one amother  and events move to a violent climax

I suspect this would like to think of itself as a message movie specifically a feminist movie. Eve does learn to think for herself and defies her creator but only to the extent of wanting another man -a dashing youung soldier rather than him. The other message is not notably profound either-Dont tamper with Nature .In short the standard horror movie schtick
The movie is badly acted .Sting resembles a block of wood in period garments and as for Ms Beals !Well -I did wonder about Frankenstein trying to animate her because no director has managed to do so in any of her movie roles so far. In the words of the Sex Pistols song ""We're all pretty ,we're so pretty.we're all pretty vacant""The best scenes are those between Brown and Rappaport which are both funny and moving

The score by Maurice Jarre is excellent -lush and romantic -as is the art direction by Michael Seymour .In an way they sum up the movie -nice to look at but with more pretnsions than actual substance",1199232000,,2658,4.666666666666667
684524,4,6303588972,"Being interested in Sting, I purchased this movie from 1985.  He plays Baron Frankenstein - a cold calculating scientist.  The movie has different aspects - the story of Charles Frankenstein and the Bride he creates for his ""monster"" - and the monster Victor on his travels with Rinaldo, gaining wisdom and insights.  I think it is a well balanced movie; well produced; well acted.  Sting is good at playing cold and demanding.",1198195200,,427,4.888888888888889
684525,4,6303588972,"I will admit after watching the 1930's version of Metropolis, it held more intelligence and a theme, which is stilled used in films today, than ""The Bride"" could ever claim! But, there is much to be loved in this film. I've always enjoyed STING, with or without The Police, and had grown to enjoy his performance in ""DUNE"". Jennifer Beals (Flashdance)is as beautiful, sweet,innocent, and dangerous as she could portray. Clancy Brown (Highlander) played Frankenstein, an experiment longing for friendship and normality in his life. And you have to have heart for the ""little guy"" in the movie! The movie has it all adventure, love, action, and some dead spots! This film is for sentimental value only. If you've a soft spot in your heart for the 80's, it wouldn't hurt to buy this film. Be forewarned: You may only watch it once, but I felt it was worth beefing up my collection of films! VIVA STING! VIVA Jennifer Beals! VIVA Clancy Brown! And VIVA that little guy!!",1193616000,,966,4.755952380952381
684526,5,6303588972,"This is my second favorite version of Frankenstein.  It's not very true to the book but it is still a great film.  Don't confuse this with the original Bride of Frankenstein, this is more like what would have happened after The Bride of Frankenstein or if Dr. Frankenstein had followed through on making a mate for his creature. It can act as a quasi-sequel to any version of the Frankenstein story.

It's a very sympathetic story toward the monster as well as towards the rights of women.  It has a kind of hammer horror quality to it, which I always feel gives a movie a Gothic charm, rather like Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. Also Sting makes for a very alluring, attractive and somewhat similar version of Dr. Frankenstein.

A pet peeve of mine is when people say this is not horror.  I loathe when people say something is not horror just because it has romance or well developed characters.  Horror is not always mindless killing.  Traditional horror never was. This is GOOD horror. It IS Horror and to say it's not horror is an insult to the genre. It has death, it has suspense, it has the characters you care about in peril, it has danger, it has intrigue, it has man made monsters. It's horror. It's good Gothic horror but it's horror.  People forget what true, traditional Gothic horror entails.

Special note: if you want a good faithful version of the Frankenstein story seek out the version starring Luke Goss as the creature from 2004 and made by Hallmark and released to DVD through Lion's Gate. That is the most faithful version to the novel.",1187654400,,1556,4.605072463768116
684527,2,6303588972,"This is a strange movie that is really like watching two different movies going on at the same time. The lively scenes with the Monster and his new found little friend are very engaging but, the scenes with Sting and his ready made bride will bore you to tears! It's a shame as this could have been much better, if the script would have had more to offer in the talky scenes. One of the better depictions of The Frankenstein Monster since the original series though.",1176595200,,466,4.430232558139535
684528,4,6303588972,"Sting is Frankenstein who decides to create a mate for his first monster. There are 2 stories going on at the same time. One is about the woman Frankenstein creates and the other is the fate of his first monster who finds a friend and joins the circus. Frankenstein names his female creation Eva and decides to teach her to be an equal to men. He educates her and spends a lot of time with her as he finds himself in love with her. The movie cuts back and forth from one story to the other. In my opinion the ""run away and join the circus"" story takes away the intensity of the horror that Frankenstein is all about. The monster, Victor never forgets Eva and dreams of finding her again but is afraid she will reject him as she is so beautiful and he knows he is ugly. As Eva gains confidence and knowledge she begins to hate Frankenstein. She is horrified when she realizes the truth about her origins. They have fight at the end; ""You did not create me."" She screams and Frankenstein answers, ""As a matter of fact, I did."" Eva meets Victor at the end.",1175472000,,1053,4.27

A little slow in parts.  I still adore Sting, so it is worth watching just to see him have a great time swishing around in an 80's goth redux of ""The Bride of Frankenstein.""

684592,3,6303588972,"""The Bride"" represents a noble effort to reinvent the Frankenstein film, but it falls a little short, mainly due to mediocre performances by Sting and Jennifer Beals. Contrary to popular belief, ""The Bride"" is NOT a remake of the classic ""Bride of Frankenstein"".  It is, in effect, a sequel. The opening scene of ""The Bride"" is a re-imagining of the final scene of ""Bride of Frankenstein"".  However, the Creature (named Victor here), his bride and the good Dr. Frankenstein all survive the laboratory's explosion. The rest of the film, which is a drama not a horror movie, follows the parallel story of the Creature and his would-be bride, discovering themselves and eventually, just maybe, each other. You'll need to see the movie to find out if the two ultimately get together, or not.  Worth a look for the open minded.",1147392000,4,822,4.857142857142857
684593,2,6303588972,"Best as i remember; back in the day, SNL has a segment called ""bad theater"", in which Leonard Pinth Garnell (ala Alastair Cook)would present a short production- and then reassure the audience, ""Now, that wasn't too good, WAS it?""

One such production was a musical based on the life of 17th century Dutch Scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.

After watching part of ""The Bride"", I think I can revisit the Leeuwenhoek show with a more generous attitude.....",1143849600,,454,4.9605263157894735
684594,4,6303588972,"First, it must be said that it helps to have seen the original 1935 Bride of Frankenstein. The original is an all time horror classic and it is viewed by some as the best horror movie ever. So if you haven't seen the original, you're missing something special. This remake is 50 years later and naturally is in color.

Sting is a quiet reserved and brooding Dr. Frankenstein and this film is a different take on the classic story and not an exact remake. Sting is good as the doctor and Jennifer Beals is great as the title character. She brings a sexiness to the role that Elsa Lanchester could not. Boris Karloff can rest comfortably in his grave knowing that no one has topped his performance as the monster and that is very true here.  The original had some great supporting performances and every role is perfectly cast in the 1935 film- this one is more focused on the 2 leads and the Bride character is much more prominent in this movie. I think critics hammered this movie because it is not the equal of the original but what is? Taken on its own, this is a fine movie if not the equal of one of the all time classics of the horror genre.",1142380800,2,1146,4.325581395348837

684596,5,6303588972,"First and last, this has got to be the ultimate love story, complete with conflict and great supporting characters, etc. Though the characters of Mary Shelley are suggested, this is in no way a horror film. The lush, gorgeous music of Maurice Jarre lets you know this right from the start. I'll not blab away the plot, except to say that the separate adventures of the bride and the ""monster"" are paralleled cleverly by director Franc Roddam. Sting was good, as was Jennifer Beals. Clancy Brown as Viktor (the monster) had wonderfully realized sense of moral character, suspicious of kindness; grateful for friendship. His friendship is found in the person of Rinaldo, wonderfully played by David Rappaport. There's adventure, loss, renewal and a darn good story to go along with it.  As in Mary Slelley's tale, there is goodness and evil. Here, it's approached in a refreshing new way. This has a more satisfying ending. I only bought this film because I love Geraldine Page. Her natural brilliance isn't given much of a challenge. ""The Bride"" came out in 1985, the same year Ms. Page gave her Oscar winning performance in ""The Trip to Bountiful"".Any moment of Page is worth it. A pity she left this world in 1986.  Aside from that, ""The Bride"" is worth consideration. This really is a great date movie...",1117238400,7,1306,4.825892857142857
684597,5,6303588972,"Thankfully this is out on DVD and a new audience can appreciate how well it was made and can learn from the Director's Commentary what makes it so special.

""The Bride"" is more Thomas Hardy than Mary Shelley, and more Gothic romance than horror. Director Franc Roddam points out (on his DVD commentary) that he wanted to make a very different version of the old story by eliminating almost all elements of horror; so only the first ten minutes qualify as authentic horror.

Roddam does not discuss the illogic of making a film devoid of the very elements its ""target audience"" was interested in seeing, but we already know that ""The Bride"" had a very poor showing at the box office. This target audience disconnect was most likely the cause. Nor does he comment on the failure to market the film to another audience segment; those interested in Gothic period pieces.

It is especially cool that 20 years later the film is finally being discovered by this other audience and they are finding it a beautifully photographed example of their genre that emphasizes story-line and atmosphere over blood and gore.

Even the much criticized casting of inexperienced leads Jennifer Beals and Sting (both look great in period costume) takes on a different dimension when the film is re-classified into the Gothic genre. Suddenly you see that the director was the one most responsible for the apparent lack of chemistry between the two stars, particularly Beals lack of passion in the scenes they share. These were the performances the Roddam wanted and not a reflection of inexperience or talent limitations. Which is not to say that Sting will ever be mistaken for a great acting talent but Beals has been unjustly criticized for a shallow performance when it was simply everything Roddam wanted it to be. Her character is only learning how to feel as the film progresses and as events play out we learn that her emotionless attitude simply conveys her indifferent feelings toward her creator.

I highly recommend this movie as Roddam is an excellent stylistic director and has made a very good Gothic romance. The fantastic production design works to unify what are two stories as Roddam cuts back and forth between the Baron (Sting) teaching his creation Eva (Beals) while David Rappaport as Rinaldo teaches his other creation Victor, played by Clancy Brown. There is a psychic link between the two creations which will result in a interesting plot twist.

Roddam has created a visually gorgeous film that has held up much better than the 1980's mainstream features that outperformed it at the box office. Don't be scared away by the negative comments, if you know what to expect (gothic romance not horror) almost any fan of films will enjoy ""The Bride"". I recommend the DVD, it was made from a flawless print and the widescreen presentation better showcases both the top-notch photography and the terrific work of the production designer.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1113868800,23,2981,4.900793650793651
