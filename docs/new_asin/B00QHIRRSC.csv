6868043,5,B00QHIRRSC,Love this movie!,1418688000,,16,4.666666666666667
6868044,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This movie is wonderful. The quality is great and the storyline is amazing. The issues dealt with are very modern, while adding the spin of Old Testament values. I think it is perfect for couples, married or not. It gives you a lot to think about in terms of your relationships.",1417564800,33,278,4.470588235294118
6868045,4,B00QHIRRSC,Good movie,1531440000,,10,4.5

6868047,5,B00QHIRRSC,This movie deserves better ratings than it's getting.,1531008000,,53,5.75
6868048,5,B00QHIRRSC,One if my favorite movies. I watch it at least three times a week lol. Very well written. The music is beautiful and the actors know how to act. Not seen in many Christian films.,1530662400,,178,4.114285714285714
6868049,1,B00QHIRRSC,"wierd and depressing, not a family movie",1529971200,,40,4.857142857142857
6868050,2,B00QHIRRSC,Moved incredibly slow.  Wanted to like it but couldn't get there.,1529798400,,65,4.909090909090909
6868051,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I was worried it would be a cheesy Christian movie (poor acting, horrible script, low budget, etc.) ...shockingly surprised. The cast is fantastic and so is the music - and although there are definitely clear biblical elements, it's well done. Worth a watch.",1529625600,,258,5.023255813953488
6868052,4,B00QHIRRSC,My friend recommended this movie years again and when I watched it I was so in love with the overall story. I'm a petty person and he would've had to do SO MUCH groveling to get back in my good graces. Hubby really raised the bar-n (haha word play) when they got together. He ruined a good thing and she stuck by him longer than most. Making the marriage work only happens if both parties are all in. Glad he kept his promise though.,1529452800,,433,4.166666666666667
6868053,5,B00QHIRRSC,I love how the Song of Solomon is weaved throughout the storyline. A beautiful example of how low temptation can bring someone and how returning to God can bring redemption.,1529107200,,173,4.8
6868054,5,B00QHIRRSC,amazing  film. A beautiful story of Redemption.,1528588800,,47,5.714285714285714

6868058,1,B00QHIRRSC,"sometimes I just cannot understand things.
Like what mindset gives this movie any stars let alone 5?
awful and slow.no plot beyond being a deeply Christian movie I guess.",1528243200,,170,4.896551724137931
6868059,5,B00QHIRRSC,"Good movie, with a good plot... Loved this movie.",1527379200,,49,4.555555555555555
6868060,5,B00QHIRRSC,"At first I thought it would be a weird, cliche country movie. I don't even like country movies. Holy crap. This movie was so well made and the acting is so realistic. This is more of a -home by yourself girl's movie night-. This movie is so real, like, as if some one wrote this as a documentary based on a true story. Hands down, awesome. This movie is such a catch, and I totally recommend it. Especially if you want to cry and laugh a lot, although, more on the crying side (there's literally mascara smears falling down my face). I haven't seen a movie this good in a long time. I would give it 10 stars, but that's not accessible.",1526515200,,635,4.213114754098361

6868063,5,B00QHIRRSC,A moving portrayal of all that makes us human and fallible . . . and loved beyond all comprehension. Thanks for the reminder.,1525564800,,125,4.478260869565218
6868064,5,B00QHIRRSC,Great story that pulls you in. There are not enough movies that focus on faith and Gods will in our lives.,1524960000,,106,4.095238095238095
6868065,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This is a wonderful movie!! I laughed, cried, and got so mad a few times that I probably busted a blood vessel. But busted blood vessel and all; this movie does a remarkable job detailing how much hard work goes into marriage & a personal relationship with God.",1524873600,,261,4.458333333333333
6868066,4,B00QHIRRSC,"I can relate to this movie, and that's said with an aching in my soul; I am reminded that no man, no person, can get through the trials and tribulation of life without help, wthout guidance, without a road map; without knowing God and his simple teachings. Simply read the Ten Commandments, then ask yourself, had I kept these, had I followed these simple guidelines, would I be in the ""thorns"" of my life? While there is forgiveness, and healing, and a Father's love on the other side, choose to follow God's laws, choose to follow so you can not only avoid the ""thorns,"" but so your choices do not bring hurt to others. Sin is it's own punishment, the consequences last for a lifetime, not just for you, but for everyone - I chose to walk my own path, and in so doing, forever scarred my wife, Debby, my son's - Benjamin and Joshua, her parents, my parents, our friends,  and the consequences of MY actions, have forever altered their lives. The choices I made we're not theirs, but the resulting fallout, the consequences, will last forever; be careful little eyes what you see, be careful little ears what you hear, be careful little feet where you go. The Good News is that my mistakes, my sin, while a permanent record, are forgiven because of God's grace and mercy. The road will be long, the days will be live one at a time, each of them requiring that you forgive yourself, but your Father, creator, will be there to wrap his arms around you every day. While I continue to deal with the consequences of MY actions, and always will, they are slowly fading in the rearview mirror, and I can start looking ahead to what God has in store for me",1524614400,,1649,4.442244224422442

6868070,5,B00QHIRRSC,I recommend this movie!,1523750400,,23,5.0
6868071,2,B00QHIRRSC,"This movie is suppose to be a ""feel good movie"". Don't get me wrong, some parts did portray that. But I felt like the movie focused a lot on all of the bad things that the main actor was doing. What bothered me, was that then when it came time to make things right with his wife, the movie was almost over. I just didn't like how crappy the main character eneded up being but within the last five minutes became an awesome person again? I wanted to see more of his change and his efforts to really prove to his wife that he was worth taking back again. It wasn't a movie that made me feel good at the end.",1523664000,3,605,4.008264462809917
6868072,5,B00QHIRRSC,"Amazing.  Take time for this show, it is rich and moving. The Bible passages are brought to life in a masterful way.",1523491200,,116,4.2727272727272725
6868073,5,B00QHIRRSC,Beautiful movie with a beautiful message!!!!,1523145600,,44,6.5
6868074,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I like this movie, because it is based on how we should honor our marriage, and how to love even though things can seperate. It is very powerful.. It's message is out of song of songs.. Love it",1523145600,,193,4.105263157894737

6868076,4,B00QHIRRSC,"I like it and it is sad that he had to make wrong choices to know which ones are right. But then again we wouldn't be humans lol
greed is a very bad rode to be on",1522454400,,162,3.4054054054054053

6868082,5,B00QHIRRSC,"We only have one life to live, appreciate life itself.",1521158400,,54,4.5
6868083,4,B00QHIRRSC,"It's a good movie.  Typical story of a man who wants something, gets what he wants and then learns he desires more.  He gets more. Then ruminates on the wisdom of Solomon and learns that it is just vanity, and meaningless.  It's tied up in a neat heartfelt ending that has the shadow of pain and the hint of the damage that has been done.  My only concern is the promise of easy forgiveness.  In real life forgiveness rarely comes easy and when it comes, it comes with scars.  Fear God and obey his commandments.  Wise words indeed.  husbands love your wives. It's easy to see how the main character Jed could have avoided the cost and merely lived a simple life, loving his wife until the end of their days, whenever that may have come.  Which is better by far.",1521072000,,762,4.347517730496454

6868088,5,B00QHIRRSC,"What I liked most about it is the life lesson this story leaves one with.  I rarely see a movie I want to watch a second time, but this is one I want to watch again.  <3",1520035200,,169,3.5405405405405403

6868090,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I am a Christian, but have never been attracted to the Christian film scene.  Bad acting, corny moments.  Too sweet for me.  But this, this has to be one of the best contemporary Christian based romance movies I have ever seen. Everything was in great taste from the storyline, to the camera work, to the actors, and most importantly, references to God.

Thank you for showing me this.  I loved it.",1519776000,,398,4.549295774647887

6868097,5,B00QHIRRSC,Excellent movie!,1519257600,,16,7.5
6868098,5,B00QHIRRSC,"One of the most breathtaking films I have ever seen.  This was so real, I had a hard time believing that there was acting involved.

Talk about a timeless, ageless story that can be watched more than once.  The first time watching it was so shocking that we had to sit and stare at the screen for a while.  Such a gripping story that is unbelievably deep.",1518998400,,355,4.253731343283582

6868101,5,B00QHIRRSC,watched it several times....great movie...,1518825600,,42,7.6
6868102,5,B00QHIRRSC,"Every message in this movie - and there are many - is on point. The script, directing, acting, locations came together for a well-made movie. What is the meaning of life, of love, of being human, of failing, of forgiving? We do so much to really do nothing that matters in the end. Thought-provoking is an understatement for every second well-spent from the beginning to the end of the travails of endlessly seeking the more that has always been with you. Truly, God has blessed us with everything we need. We have no reason to be chasing the wind. And even when we do, the way back is always lit by the enduring love of the ever-burning candle in the window so those who lose their way can always find home.",1518825600,,708,4.412213740458015

6868110,5,B00QHIRRSC,This movie was good and it shows you what Eccl 3: was all about in the Bible.,1516838400,,77,3.588235294117647
6868111,4,B00QHIRRSC,"One of the messages of this movie is that money doesn't matter, and the Godly man should choose an evening of playing catch with his son over the chance to make a million dollars. I wonder, though, if this message would seem as lofty coming from the mouth of a disheveled wife living with her two kids in a homeless shelter, rather than a woman with salon fresh hair standing on the porch of her pristine country manor gazing out at the endless (perfectly maintained) vineyards surrounding her?",1516752000,,494,4.625
6868112,5,B00QHIRRSC,loved the story!! loved the characters!  worth watching for sure!!,1516406400,,66,5.6
6868113,5,B00QHIRRSC,Was surprised by the quality of acting and music with this very well done and touching movie. Excellent story line paired with everything else.,1515888000,,143,5.0
6868114,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This is a fully realized vision-put-to-film. I can honestly say I loved everything about it. Although the actors/actresses truly sold it for me, with incredible chemistry among the many fated relationships & romances, and I can't say enough about the quality of the music and the originality of the songs....(these are not just actors, they are incredibly talented musicians) a huge nod has to go to the writer / director Richard Ramsey for such beautiful inspiration, compelling characters, REAL dialogue and reactions from the characters, and overall realism and BELIEVABILITY of the overall storyline, and oh ya, the southern backdrop with its lakes, country houses, and lush gardens were gorgeous. It's true that this plot has been done before (rise and fall of a rock star who battles personal demons, drugs, and affairs) but this movie delighted and surprised me all the way through.

I truly appreciate quality filmmaking and unforgettable storytelling, and this touched my heart. The actors Alan Powell, Ali Faulkner, and especially the ""jezebel"" temptress Caitlin Nicol-Thomas were just amazing. Caitlin is so stunning, charming, and talented. Her violin is magical, and her confidence on-screen portraying a troubled-but-intriguing siren was notable. I would see anything she is in. And yes, it's clearly a Christian film, but it's subtle, and its a REAL FILM, not just a Christian film. I'm more of a metaphysical guy myself, but wow, did I appreciate this. And the Scripture that the narrator (Jed's character) reads throughout the film mirrors his personal growth cycle and realizations, and is universal enough to appeal to the majority of viewers, and also reflects the character's sincere maturation process, not just a ""please take me back baby, I've changed, and everything will be different this time"" line which so many movies have done. This growth feels real, because you get to watch and witness how each character EVOLVES throughout his/her personal journey and challenges. I truly felt like a fly on the wall as if I were watching this couple meet for the first time, and how it might unfold. That says to me, it was realistic and believable. And oh my goodness, the comical song he sings at the Harvest (wine) festival to mock the smug ex-boyfriend was an instant classic, well done, very witty! Loved this movie all around, and although the drug use might be a bit much for younger children, it's excellent for teens and instills powerful moral messages under the guise of a great film. Thanks Richard Ramsey",1515715200,13,2535,5.09375
6868115,5,B00QHIRRSC,This was a great find on Amazon Video! It was an extremely powerful message showing the reality of life. The highest highs and lowest lows.,1515715200,,139,4.6
6868116,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This is a movie about how lives can be tested and challenged, and what the effects and losses can be by one's choices. It is a Bible based story, tastefully done, and we highly recommend watching it. It certainly makes one think about life, making the right choices, and respecting the ones you love, and the ones whom love you. One truly has all they need, yet some feel they will never have enough. Food for thought.",1515715200,7,418,4.441558441558442

6868172,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I watched this mainly because I like Alan (the actor who plays Jed) and his band/former band Anthem Lights. I thought I would give it a try. I figured I would like it, but it was better than I expected. The acting was extremely good. I was very impressed. I loved the musical element to the movie. All are very talented musicians. The storyline is a little predictable, as it is inspired from the book ""Song of Songs"" from the Bible not to mention the topic is rise and struggle of stardom. You know how the story will flow and end (just look at the cover photo and it tells the story), but that has never been a problem with me. It gives a great message. It does have a slight religious theme (I seen mention where that was not known) but it isn't strong or preachy. The main message is about priorities and living for more than ourselves. That can be accepted and agreed upon by everyone. If A+ is award winning, this is A-. Looking forward to these artist future projects.",1487980800,,975,4.333333333333333
6868173,1,B00QHIRRSC,"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen: 20min of a sort of low quality rom-com followed by the story of a man who becomes famous, comes home once in a while to try to force himself on his wife, then, when she resists, takes a mistress, abandons his pregnant wife and son, becomes a drug addict, starts abusing his mistress too, before magically ""rekindling his faith"" in the last 10min of the movie and is forgiven for everything.

It is inspired by Solomon's whole life not just the Song of Solomon so I would probably have advertised it a little differently on the cover but details, details. Its a good story overall and they managed to make it so that there is some suggestive material but its a pretty clean film. It made me step outside the box a little bit and try to put into context what Solomon could have been going through (emotionally) when he wrote the different books that he did.

It suffers in the way many Christian movies do: melodramatic to prove a point. The whole thing with him becoming a drug addict as a result of his affair was a bit much. Also, I think they could've fleshed out the characters more. I think we as the audience were supposed to feel more sorry for Rose, but she came off as a bit of a shrew. I had more interest and empathy for the mistress quite frankly, although I don't think that was the intention. She actually had a more visceral reaction to losing Jed than Rose, his wife, did.

6868263,5,B00QHIRRSC,"Generally, I come into Christian films with really low expectations. Such films are often preachy, pandering to the audience, and devoid of any significant aesthetic qualities.

This film is one of the few exceptions.

While the film took a while to get past my biases against Christian movies, once I realized this wasn't your average Christian film, I quickly settled into enjoying this engaging and thought-provoking film. For the first film this director has ever done, the story was amazing: subtext, layered characterization, plenty of plot twists, a deep theme, etc. The adulteress is often a cliched character type in Christian films but I really appreciated what this film did to humanize her and give her realistic motivations.

Anyways, I don't want to say much about this to avoid spoiling the movie, but let me close off by saying that this is one of only two Christian films that I like. And this movie is already one of my favorite movies of all time, after having only seen it once! (Normally it takes multiple viewings for me to truly appreciate a film.) The movie was utterly beautiful. If Christian films looked more like this movie, I'd have no reason to lambast the genre.",1484870400,,1193,4.8669950738916254

The characters are not even two dimensional; they're just flat caricatures of whatever two sentence storyline the writer had in mind when he/she wrote this mess.  The background voice continued to quote from Song of Solomon and Ecclesiastes throughout the movie, with almost no regard to whether or not the particular verse(s) fit the scene.  I'm certain that I could sit down right now and write a better movie.  This is two and a half hours I'll never have back... don't make the same mistake I made.",1483920000,5,654,4.701754385964913

6868319,5,B00QHIRRSC,I was overwhelmed by this movie. I see that some people didn't see it as positive as I did but I guess it depends on where you stand. The reading of The Scriptures throughout made it so meaningful. If you are not a believer then you probably won't feel it as deeply but maybe you will receive something positive from it.

6868351,4,B00QHIRRSC,"This is an excellent movie with great acting and musical performance by the leads.  There is a lot of music, lots of performances which tend to drag the movie out a bit.  It would easily make a 90 minute movie, but you will enjoy the music.  The songs written for the movie are excellent (compared to ""Country Strong"") and the performances are simply top-notch.  There really aren't any surprises except for how quickly he gets his wife back and the credits roll, but it's an enjoyable movie.

I'm also not a big fan of the whole ""Song of Solomon"" angle - it's a stretch to say it's based on that book.  They do quote from it, but there are at least as many quotes from Ecclesiastes.  Still, this is a good movie.",1482796800,,713,4.356060606060606

And yet... This film speaks effectively to the classic Christian story of redemption, but one does not need to be a Christian to be moved by the message, no more than they need to be a believer in Heaven and angels to have their spirits lifted by that same message of hope which is offered in, ""It's a Wonderful Life (which is given a brief and well-placed tip-of-the-hat in this film). It has excellent production values, with an attractive able, and professional cast. Good music. Decent editing. Great set & scene designs and clothes/costumes/makeup. Lovely locations. High quality cinematography. This is not a big movie. It's small, and personal. Kind of ""indie"" in that way. It isn't a great movie, but it's quite a good one. It IS an overtly, and straightforwardly Christian film, though. People who can't help being offended by the very specific focus that comes from judging things from that world view may not be able to enjoy it.

6868533,1,B00QHIRRSC,"This might have been a great movie, but at the end of six minutes I was so lost that I figured there was no way I would be able to catch up.  I have no idea what was going on.  I think there was a couple of flashbacks, a flash forward, and maybe even a flash sideways.  This must be one of those movies that you have to watch three or four times just to figure out the beginning.  The narration didn't seem to match what I was watching on screen, and I couldn't understand what the narrator was trying to say.  It was a toss up between listening to the narrator or watching the movie, but I couldn't do both.  I think a concert was going on, then a bunch of drunk people were having a party.  A young boy was fingering a guitar, then the singer got married and died; and somewhere in the process someone hanged himself.  Oh, I almost forgot:  after all that, the movie begins.  This movie is free to Prime members, so I didn't lose anything except six minutes and the time it took to write this review.  I'm not a big fan of movies that take two people explaining what's happening in order for me to understand what's going on.",1475280000,,1127,4.147465437788019

6868535,5,B00QHIRRSC,"When I added this to my watchlist and finally watched it, I had no idea it would have so much depth - and I didn't know it was Christian-based either, so that was a plus.  Beautifully written with such moving biblical content, I was intrigued and hooked from the opening scene.  Much like the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter, it's amazing how many of us struggle with these (or similar) things in our lives - living for the world (whether it be lust, money, greed, material possessions, etc) is like living to catch the wind...  This is such a good movie!",1475193600,,560,4.41747572815534

6868637,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I hadn't heard about this movie before a week ago.  I just saw it on Amazon's Prime Video list and it seemed to be a nice, light, entertaining, romantic movie.  Put it on my wish list and watched it tonight.  I was completely blown away on how meaningful the story is and the music is absolutely gorgeous. Will be searching on YouTube for the sound track.  It is also a clean movie in sense that it doesn't have profanity or nudity.  The landscape setting is stirringly beautiful.  The story tells of the challenges the most marriages go through when a couples are trying to raise their families and one or both spouses are trying to build a career at the sametime.  The challenges put a lot of strain on the relationship between a husband and wife.  It's difficult in this fast-paced world that we live in to truly nurture relationships.  This movie captures the struggles very well.  It is also brave in conveying the message of the spiritual void  that most of us feel that is messing in our lives despite successes we may achieve along the way.  We lose our groundedness on this earth as we are pushed in so many directions.  I think that our relationships with our loved ones suffer the most.  Thank you to the producers for making this incredible movie.  I just loved it a whole lot.",1472860800,5,1289,4.495689655172414

6868655,3,B00QHIRRSC,"This film had many good scenes and songs and an interesting, timeless, while predictable, plot.  What marred the quality of this movie for me was that Ali Faulkner's (Rose) acting was just short of the mark.  Rather than seeming innocent, vulnerable and deeply in love, she was instead vacant, bland, self-absorbed, lacking in depth and and devoid of sensuality.  She did redeem herself with the scenes of grief.  Alan Powell was well cast and displayed all the devotion, love, greed, dreams, scars, talent, ugliness, confusion, anger, lust, and remorse that Jed experienced, but Faulkner's lack of response and character development made the whole romance feel flat. Caitlin Nicol-Thomas was marvelous.  She brought a vibrancy, tension, and yearning to the plot that was beautiful, painful, not quite evil, yet sinful and fascinating all the same. Her violin and musical performances - wow! - made the movie worth it.  Several other supporting actors were good, too. I thought between 3 stars and 4 for this rating, but just felt the flat, almost boring performance from Ali Faulkner (despite her pretty face and long silky hair) made the main plot of the movie rather meaningless, so I settled for the 3 star rating.",1472515200,,1218,5.065

I'm the typical consumer who posts when she's either completely enthralled or entirely disappointed. The Song was absolutely the best Christian movie I've seen, and I've seen a lot because it's a genre I enjoy.

My biggest lamentation about Christian films is that the acting sucks and the storylines are thin. The Song had superb acting, with characters being brought to life. I felt for each character in the film. This movie made me feel like I was watching my friends, not actors. In addition to the incredible acting the writing was spectacular and the music was wonderful. I'm a writer, so the plot and execution in movies is a big deal to me. I don't just want a feel good story, I want substance. And wow, did I get substance. I can't more highly recommend this movie.",1471132800,3,871,4.547770700636943

6868734,3,B00QHIRRSC,"Good movie but...(Warning- Spoilers) First the pros: Very good story with a valuable message for our day with so many marriages going down the drain. Acting was very good. Important points of forgiveness and love shown at the end. Another viewer commented the wife should not have taken her husband back. I disagree. That is what love and forgiveness is all about. To many marriages fail because one or both parties are selfish and unforgiving and unloving. True love never fails even though people fail. Love covers a multitude of sins. Christians are to express God's love to others and to one another and that involves loving even when we have been wronged and forgiving when the transgressor seeks forgiveness.  Yes, Jed was an idiot but did the right thing by returning to his wife and she modeled Godliness by taking her husband back.  The cons: The music was just okay, nothing great. Most of all, for a Christian themed movie, some of the content was inappropriate and unnecessary. Yes, Christians stumble and sin but matters like smoking, drinking, use of drugs, and sex don't have to be shown or can be less explicitly inferred and still get the point across in a movie.",1469577600,,1180,4.779411764705882

Also the prudishness of this film was such a joke! It's scary that Christian politicians want to regulate America so everyone is living life exactly like the hyper boring husband and wife in this film.

6868812,4,B00QHIRRSC,"I enjoyed this movie. It is a great choice if you are in the mood for a decent romance movie.

I really liked the lead actor; he did a great job with the role. He is a great musician and singer (at least it appears like he is doing everything himself) and there was quite a bit of depth required for his character. I think he nailed it. The lead actress did a good job. She felt very small town, girl next door like which I think was perfect for the role. The two of them have good chemistry so the love story was believable.

It's a decent portrayal of what a couple can go through with a successful musician on the road and how it can affect a marriage.

All in all, I would say give it a go! :-)",1467158400,,698,3.9361702127659575

Then it shows us the power of Gods love for us, that no matter what we do, he is always ready for us to come back to him. He forgives us & loves us. He wants to have a very real relationship with us. We just have to realize it & come back to him. It shows us that there is nothing we can do on our own, & do we try! We need Gods grace to get us through everything.",1464912000,,522,3.669642857142857

Christian movies tend to have poor acting, even though the underlying message is good. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the actors did and how great the music was.

The main character (""Jed"") learns, like Solomon, that an empty heart will only feel full when it is filled with the love of God; not our love for Him, but His love for us.  What an inspiring movie about untethered ambition, temptation, loss, forgiveness, and redemption.  Thank God for Jesus; our sins are washed CLEAN! Amen.",1463788800,,594,4.663461538461538

The Song was one of the best movies Ive seen even with the regular production companies.  The actors did fantastic and the undertones and references to Song of Solomon were just amazing!!!

6869074,5,B00QHIRRSC,I loved everything about this movie!  It involves the realistic points of life.  How the devil can work on us and how easily we can fall into his traps if we are not in God's word.  I think that this movie can all make us know how important it is to be prayed up & just how easily the devil can steal our happiness.  Definitely watch!,1461715200,,334,4.015151515151516

It tells the truths of what can happen if a couple doesnt lean twards each other, and what it takes to make love happen!  We understood it well. When you've been through a lot of life's challenges in marriage, and you know it takes the Word of God to stay strong. Honestly, even then, you have to keep your eyes Soley on Him with no secrets from each other to keep walking strong together. Learning to listen to each other with every intent to learn the grace of God.  this movie gives you a perspective of truth and uses the song of Solomom to remind you why its written!",1461283200,,629,4.277310924369748

Very inspiration and real in terms of life and how, even with the best of intentions, we can all mess up; hurting ourselves and /or cause pain to others.  Some sad parts (where I was yelling at the screen - ""don't do it!""); other parts - I was in tears [but I cry very easily so don't let this throw you], Overall very good movie but would not recommend for youth (more like an 18 years  and up movie about life).

Hope this helps and God Bless You!

I enjoy the spiritual aspect as well, there are many temptations out there, we all rise and fall, but there is redemption and forgiveness, which though isn't always easy to accomplish, are values needed in all our relationships. I couldn't imagine a song being made just for me, inspired because of me. How awesome is that! I dream of a man with that much soul and depth.",1458691200,,473,4.511627906976744

I read the summary & thought it sounded interesting but had little expectations. I had not heard of the film & had no idea that it was a Trinity Broadcasting film.
This is a wonderful story based on the book of Ecclesiastes & Solomon's plight.
A rising musician who is the son of a famous father falls in love & marries the love of his life. He finds fame & all the temptations that follow. This is the story of his rise & fall then how he picks himself up by the grace of God.

Definitely a step away from what you would consider a ""typical Christian movie"" because it really highlights the reality of how show business can change you, your priorities, and your motives.

Not the usual cliched or over-the-top sweet Christian film, but rather a moving telling of a man battling the temptations that come with fame and separation from his family.

6869446,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I was very surprised by this movie. Usually movies that are Christian or Christian themed fail to deliver because they are either too saccharine and gloss over the grittiness of living a Christian life and the temptations that we are all faced with, or they are just poorly acted or directed with bad production. I can say that this film not only told of the struggle of a man in raw gritty true to life detail, but it was also well acted, directed and written. It has me thinking, and pondering days after watching it. I highly recommend this. It is enjoyable and will stay with you.",1455667200,,584,4.4672897196261685

The acting as great and the movie well done, especially for a Christian film.  It wasn't at all preachy. Loved the unique way they wove in verses from Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon.  Most of the kids probably didn't even know it was scripture.  Highly recommend. Great themes of purity, commitment, forgiveness, etc.",1455580800,,443,4.7894736842105265

Loved the verses from Song of Solomon throughout the movie, and such a wholesome movie.  Not your typical Christian movie, this really kept my attention and re-rooted my own marriage vows with my husband.  The Devil can push his way at any cost, and this movie exemplified that perfectly.  I have watched it 3 more times and have told many others about it.  I was a little thrown off when a question was asked in the movie of who do you put your hope in (the answer was not directly spoken of Jesus).  The website that flashed at the end of the movie led me to believe that the plot was based on something spiritual and not faith based in Jesus Christ.",1455580800,,767,4.404255319148936

And is alcohol really that much a part of christian family life now?
I don't touch the stuff at all after God told me ""it's a shame that you even want to"", ouch... Yes God spoke to me in a very vivid dream and said those exact words ""it is a shame that you even want to"" ...
So much for me being the cool hip christian after that, what deception is in our churches right now -  sure you can, but why do you want to ? (and I'm not talking about when the husband in the movie went astray. There was booze all throughout the movie with the saintly grandpa smoking and drinking, and owning a vineyard) what's next - a christian weed farm ? you can, but it is a shame that you want to...",1455580800,,851,4.089820359281437

6869571,4,B00QHIRRSC,I liked it - but betrayal is hard to watch. I don't want to talk about the ending as I don't want to ruin it for others - but it wasn't a film I'd watch with my pre-teen.  Not because there is anything she'd be shocked/ruined by - but because there are a lot of other shows that we enjoy better.  My young adult daughter watched it with me and it's sad but most of her friends have had issues very much like these ... is it a sign of the times? I think so. I hope it runs its course soon and families start raising their kids to be more accountable to each other in their relationships and to their kids than we are seeing today.  At some point the  pendulum has to swing the other way.,1454889600,,686,3.949275362318841

6869581,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This is one of those must-see films that you'll never hear about. I don't know if it was ever shown on the big screen or not, but it should have been. I happened to find it on Amazon Prime.

The plot is all-too common in real life these days. The son of a former country music star is struggling to make his own mark on the world, when he meets the girl of his dreams. He sings an impromptu song at a concert at her father's wine-tasting party, and she goes out on a date with him. Under the inspiration of God and their love, he writes a special song for her that launches him into stardom.

But then along comes a temptress. He tries to resist at first, but the demands of his music career and too much time away from the woman he married makes her hard to resist. He falls, gets into alcohol and drugs to boot, and everything disintegrates.

For too many movie and music stars, that's where the story ends. But not for this guy. Wisdom kicks in. He comes to his senses, and makes all the right choices--according to God's economy, not the world's.

I love how the book of Ecclesiastes is quoted extensively in the movie, along with passages from Song of Songs and Proverbs. You even have a pretty decent rendition of the song, ""Turn, Turn, Turn,"" included. This is not a modern retelling of King Solomon's life, but the wisdom of Solomon and a mirror of the king's folly are woven throughout the movie. Yet, it feels more like a Nicholas Sparks story than a sermon.

More than your average ""chick flick,"" this film would be great to show at a couple's retreat as a discussion starter--kind of like the blockbuster, Fireproof. The story is so engaging, I found myself ""talking to"" the characters, trying to warn them what was coming or urge them to take a different course of action. Keep the tissue box handy, but hang in there until the very end. You'll be glad you did!",1454803200,,1874,4.373563218390805

6869584,4,B00QHIRRSC,Knowing it was a modern day King David and King Solomon story made it tough knowing what would b happening. That is one of the saddest stories in the Bible.

A talented singer whose father was a famous musician and singer lives in the shadow of his father as he strives to make it in the music world.  The love of a woman who is good and faithful supports him as he becomes the new sensation due to a love song he wrote for her.  As plots go, in come the evils of life on the road with a beautiful available woman.  Due to the stress of this life, home is no longer his refuge and he willingly follows his father's legacy to be famous.  Alcohol, drugs, sex. and fame tear him down and he loses the purity of the life he truly wants.  Watch it to find out if redemption is offered or if he even wants it.  There are no happy endings for every character which I had sympathy for all but the main character.  Adults who knew what they were doing to cause the problems, I believe, gave good interpretations of what happens to marriage and careers colliding.

Needless to say, the rest of the story concerned the hero's love life and final quitting his musical road show in favor or rejoining his wife and son, very predictable and boring.",1454198400,,459,4.784810126582278

6869749,5,B00QHIRRSC,"As stated in the headline, I'm not usually a fan of Christian movies. Not because I'm not a Christian, I am, but rather most of the time I feel with some of them they try to squeeze in as much scripture into every conversation as much as possible. Please don't interpret that I don't want to hear Gods Word, but rather would like to see more realistic dialogues in these movies.

This movie I saw and wanted to give it a try and am so glad I did!!! I absolutely enjoyed all of it! The acting was great and the whole story of gaining the whole world and losing your soul was so well shown here. This movie shows that success is wonderful when God leads you there, but when decisions are made from desires of our flesh and convictions are thrown out the door, it doesn't take too long to be far from God. More importantly I loved how this movie showed that a husband and wife went through dishonesty, adultery, addiction and at the end of it all God brought to them restoration and forgiveness. The best part of this movie was the way they spoke the Word throughout the movie really showed that scriptures were designed to always remain relevant and speak to our hearts. Check out the movie, you will enjoy it.",1454198400,,1208,4.345132743362832
6869750,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I went into this movie thinking it might be a bit cheesy, but I was intrigued by the story-line following the life of Solomon. I was most impressed with the handling of a tough subject in an honest manner. It is a movie that I would recommend whole-heartedly because not only did it share the message of Solomon, but it was a moving reminder that marriage is a valuable and worthy thing.
As others have shared, this is NOT a movie for children. The debauched lifestyle shown is not something to expose your family to. However, the message is a valuable one that mature teens can benefit from. Moreover, it is a movie that reminds married couples of the vows the took, and why they took them.",1454112000,,691,4.448818897637795

6869829,2,B00QHIRRSC,"Aside from the basic message ""the bible scriptures""in the movie were was good, but not excellent.  The story line was weak, the acting was weak in many parts of the movie and they were inconsistent with some of the messages that they were trying to get across.  Example ""she not sleeping with her husband"" because she was tired.  Yet they had all kinds of $'s to buy a home, and have all kinds of ""things"", and couldn't afford a babysitter, or nanny?  Come on!  And after he cleaned up his ""act"" of drug addiction, he goes back down the path that brought him there?  Ok some common sense needs to be written into the plot on why he ""had to do that"".  That was very weak.
The list of items within the story line were not what I would consider a 4 star rating.",1453680000,,758,4.222222222222222

6869931,4,B00QHIRRSC,"When it comes to Christian movies, there are three groups of people. You have the people who automatically write it off if there is any sort of ""Christian agenda"", there are the people who will rate everything 10/10 if it fits neatly within their definition of entertainment in the Christian subculture and then you have people who look at something critically and try to pull out the good and the bad. I don't know if I place myself evenly in any of these tribes, but I hope to be someone who can bring a few good points out.

Even as a committed Christian, I don't really like watching Christian movies all that much. The often hard-hitting, poorly written, cheesy acting narratives just don't fit my taste. A friend of mine watched this with his wife and told me that it was good. Trusting my friend's judgment and wanting to give Christian films a 22nd chance, I watched it through Prime. Right as I tuned in, I was caught off guard.

The opening sequence was so clich and literal, I had to hold back the groans. The beauty of film is in its mystery and suspense; not its sermons with accompanying visuals. I stuck it out and was gently drawn in to the love story of Jed and Rose. Both of them were amazingly gorgeous which of course helps. And being the hopeless romantic that I am, a movie has to be really bad for me to not enjoy two people falling in love.

Through the foggy lens of a loudly-trumpeted (but needed) moral message and a pretty expectant plot line, what really helped this movie get off the ground were the original songs and the pretty surprisingly great performances. For me, Alan Powell made me believe the story. Through the entire movie, the songs and Scripture readings from Solomon took a movie that could have been quite bland and turned it into something that everyone can relate to. Everyone goes through seasons. Everyone experiences heartache. I think it was right after Jed (Powell) left his wife, there was an especially emotional long take that I felt Powell just nailed in his emotional response to the brokenness of leaving his wife.

Many Hollywood movies that I have seen recently have had pretty good starts, good middles, but the ending really was a let down. Although this movie has its awkward moments (and its continual conversation and obsession with sexual fulfillment), I think the payoff in the end is the strongest I've seen in a movie in a long time. You just feel good about where the characters came and where they ended up and that's more than I can say about many of the Oscar-nominated films that I've seen in the last few months.

CONCLUSION: Watch it!",1453420800,,2611,4.594420600858369

6869972,2,B00QHIRRSC,"My feelings on this film are a mixed bag and the characters lack of acting abilities did not make it a movie that flowed easily. I do feel it was an honest depiction of the debauchery that many fall into in the world today that has troubled us since the beginning of man. It is a constant problem that plagues many, especially those who are on the road a lot and separated from their wives and children.

It took awhile but the main character, Jeb (Solomon), learned what is important in life and that his alcohol, drugs, affair, success etc was nothing without God and his family. He gave it all up for the greater good but, IMO, I would have had great difficulty taking him back. Forgiving him...yes in time, but to enter back into the marriage when he had behaved disgustingly and treated his wife so badly...well I just don't know if I could do that.

Because of the subject matter with the drunkenness, drug induced stupors, life on the road, and a continuing sexual affair I did not feel it appropriate for my teen children. Was there a good message...yes, but so much more negative than positive.",1453075200,3,1103,4.51

Watching the story unfold it's uplifting and yet at the same time you can see the tragedy present itself around the next corner. The music for the most part is fairly decent and mostly original.

The only part that was detracting was when Jed's beard took on a life of it's own................It felt as though it was eating his face and at anytime it would attack anybody else in the scene.

I would have loved to see the wife increase business on her father's ranch, come up with her own business plan and leave her flash-in-the pan musician husband.

Loved the story line and how well the movie uses modern day examples to tell Solomon's story. It's a great movie to watch whether you are married or not. It is a clean movie, meaning it has no nudity, profanity or violence. It does depict the use of drugs, alcohol and implied sex, so it's not a movie you want to watch with children under 13. I highly recommend this movie, whether you are a person of faith or not.

This movie was well done, very well done. I do not know why I didn't hear about it - there are plenty of Christian movies touted to be ""must see!!!"" and end up being beyond disappointing.

There are many biblical references in the movie however if you are not very familiar with the passages of The Bible you should still watch and will be able to appreciate the raw honesty of the very real storyline which shows love, pain, joy, deceit, unfaithfulness, guilt and forgiveness.

Everything seems to teach life is black and white, quit, don't work at it, you are always right, life should be easy.  This movie was real.

I was expecting some really hokey, overdone Christian movie with a couple bad songs sprinkled throughout that I would shut off 10 minutes in. This movie actually is not like that at all. I'm not sure if the bad reviewers actually watched any of the movie or just rated it based on the fact that it has some religious themes and they are not religious thus they wanted to give it a bad review due to their disagreement with those themes.

This movie has some really beautiful and very tasteful religious undertones throughout (which, to be honest, could even be interpreted simply as moral themes, rather than ""only"" religious) and a few times those themes are clear and overt. But the majority of the movie, besides the beautiful poem (Song of Solomon) being read over symbolic scenes, does not directly mention God, prayer, Christianity, church, or anything religious. Sure, if you are looking for the religious symbolism, you'll see it. But that's not really what the movie is about... What this movie is really about is marriage, plain and simple. It is a lovely story that deals with many relevant scenarios within marriage, such as temptation, infidelity, parenthood, forgiveness, redemption, death, anger, depression, drug abuse, the meaning and implication of sex, and more.

For those of you that don't believe in marriage or that you don't believe that marriage is a covenant and a partnership you enter into and choose everyday to honor those promises and to choose your partner everyday, for those of you that believe marriage is a contract, that marriage is something you do until the butterflies and lust disappear and that you can always get out of it, yeah, you probably won't like this movie. But for anyone who believes in LOVE, this movie is definitely worth watching! It's a beautiful story about humanity, about love, about marriage, about family.

What I liked the most about this movie, which I have never seen portrayed in this way, were the scenes dealing with sex within marriage. Many married couples experience ""dry spells"" and this movie deals with that, BUT EXPLAINS WHY the couple were having issues in that department. Normally, the reasons for these issues in movies are left unexplained, or worse, are used to portray that the marriage is ""dead,"" that the couple no longer loves each other, or that the wife is some evil witch withholding sex from her husband and thus has lost her beauty and worth as a woman. This movie addresses those dry spells married couples experience, and in a very meaningful way. It does so in a way that simultaneously addresses a larger social issue, the obsession with sex and pleasure without regard or care for the other person (essentially, using another person for your own pleasure) but it does so within the context of marriage, which is usually left unaddressed in film. And I thought this was a really vital piece of the story, because it is SO RELEVANT to real life.

The movie was truly a great story, with good music (way more music than I was expecting!), and good acting. I really don't know what people were saying when they said the acting was bad--I found it quite believable and realistic. I wasn't crazy about some of the songs featured in the film, but I found the majority to be quite good. And I really loved this movie because the story is relatable and relevant to real people's lives. This movie is not ""religious propaganda,"" poorly acted, nor does it contain a poorly-written story. I loved it; you should give it a chance.",1450310400,2,3572,4.7938311688311686
6870050,5,B00QHIRRSC,Great Biblical movie! A Must see,1450137600,,32,4.5
6870051,1,B00QHIRRSC,This movie is almost an exact rip off Walk the Line; it's similar to Johnny Cash's story but with a religious music theme. I don't have an issue with the religious aspect  but I don't think that it was worth watching.,1450051200,2,217,4.2926829268292686
6870052,5,B00QHIRRSC,"The first time I watched this, I could barely finish because of the massacre the main character is making of his life, but I couldn't stop watching. The end is beautiful too. Amazing acting and writing. I love this retelling of the life of King Solomon from the Bible. It is an all-too-realistic story of love, betrayal, and healing.",1449964800,,333,4.661016949152542
6870053,5,B00QHIRRSC,Excellent movie. It was great to find a modern movie that wasn't just junk!,1449964800,,75,4.428571428571429

6870055,5,B00QHIRRSC,"Be sure to watch past the credits or you will miss the best scene of the movie!!!  I cannot say enough great things about this movie!!  You must watch it!!  My husband and children were camping, and I was home wrapping Christmas gifts.  This popped up as a recommended movie on Amazon Prime streaming and was free, so I pressed play.  No more gifts got wrapped and I was totally enthralled.  Great acting, great message!  I will watch this movie over and over, I'm sure!",1449878400,2,470,4.458823529411765
6870056,4,B00QHIRRSC,"This reminds me a lot like Fireproof.  The movie is Christian based about Marriage, Love, Purity, Unfaithfulness, Family all rolled up in one and actually has some descent songs in it.  It's a movie to definitely watch!  And the male lead makes you want to HATE him and beat him on the side of the head and back to liking him.  The only thing I really hated and was annoying and I believe took away from the movie was his long beard.  I know there's symbolism there but it still was annoying.  Some guys look great in beards this guy not so much.  Over all a descent movie.",1449792000,,573,4.25

6870058,5,B00QHIRRSC,"When I found out a member of a band that I like had made a movie, I instantly added it to my mental watch list. I found it on the prime store this morning and started watching without hesitation. The story line is well developed, and it leaves the watcher with a sense of fullness when it concludes. Great cast, great movie, and an even better message. Be not tempted by earthly things. Lead not into temptation, for God has a plan for you that extends beyond our existence on this earth.",1449792000,,488,4.315217391304348

6870073,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This is one of those movies that stay with you. All of us have hurts in our life from people we love. This story will reflect life's wounds (in a story that may not be like yours, but reflect hurts nonetheless), but will remind you that we all need to persevere to find a good meaning anyway. It brings truth of how we all must forgive so that guilt doesn't destroy us. It brought many tears but mostly brought a need to keep joy. So inspiring!!",1449360000,,445,4.186046511627907
6870074,4,B00QHIRRSC,"I wasn't crazy about the first few minutes of the movie but by the end of it I understood why it was done that way.  A story of faith, love, sin, forgivenesses. Enjoyed it. Recommend it.",1449273600,,186,4.166666666666667

Being a music movie I was expecting it to be boring and that I would fall asleep shortly after pushing play.  That wasn't the case.

6870197,4,B00QHIRRSC,"I'm not much into religious message films, but I found myself caring about these people and being encouraged to do some thinking about what ""success"" and ""fame"" are all about.  Not convinced that it was totally necessary for the hero to give up his career -- if I were still teaching, it would be challenging to discuss the film's message with a class. The film makes a case for Christian fidelity to home and family, but there's also the Christian admonition not to hide your ""light"" (talent?) under a bushel.  Alan Powell handles the demands of his role very well.  The critics were snobs about the film, which is their problem.",1448409600,,630,4.657657657657658

FANTASTIC original music, great acting, real-life gritty content.  Somehow covers issues like marriage, sexual love, sexual immorality, drug use, and feeling purposeless and depressed without a single profane word (the strongest word used was ""skank"") or even a glimpse of nudity; and you would never even notice the absence of these elements because the quality of the story and cinematography is so strong.

The worlds way will always lead you further into sin than you intended to go, leaving you empty with a continual unsatisfied chasing for more and more that will  NEVER  satisfy.

I loved the quotes from the Song of Solomon that were recited at different times during the movie.  Also I loved hearing some of the oldie Country songs and the great guitar music.

I think if you like movies like the Left Behind Series, you might like this.  If your taste is more secular, however, you might find it kind of in your face preachy.  Overall, it wasn't bad, it just got so concerned with teaching morals in an obvious way, that the characters ended up more as caricatures of good, evil, and somewhere-in-between than real people.  I do have to say the music wasn't bad, although I would have liked more songs.

6870317,4,B00QHIRRSC,"I just finished watching The Song and I was impressed with it. So many Christian films lack quality, especially in cinematography and acting that I had to say were refreshingly good in THIS film. The continuity of the story and plot were also good (they too are often ""choppy"" in some poor quality films). I especially liked the LACK of a heavy-handed approach to the underlying message that came straight from the book of Ecclesiastes, Solomon's book of wisdom in the Bible. While the ""narrator"", the main character, often voiced over portions of Ecclesiastes, it was part and parcel of the plot itself, not an ""add-on"" meant just to preach ""at"" you.

The story focuses on the relationship of the character Jed King, a singer and the son of David King, a former superstar, and his wife Rose. These two primary parts are played admirably by Alan Powell, in real life a singer with the band, Anthem Lights, and Ali Faulkner. Jed is a wanna-be singer at first who becomes famous himself. Just as King Solomon was faced with the temptations of the world, so Jed is shown faced with and succumbing to the temptations that come from fame and fortune. The story has been told before, ""nothing new under the sun"" as King Solomon himself stated, but it was refreshing to see it with the direct backdrop of spiritual truth embedded into the flow of the story. Yet again, did not feel heavy-handed.

Before watching, I did note one reviewer stating the PG 13 rating was well-deserved. I agree. This story has some pretty strong sexual scenes (nothing ""shown"" of course) and drug elements (clearly shown!), as well as one bloody scene not for children and, with respect to sincere believers, some parents might want to restrict some even older than 13. Not exactly a spoiler if you understand the basic message but : Adultery is certainly featured. To be clear however, the message of the movie IS biblical. One negative review implied the message could have been better, implying that the producers could have directly preached the gospel. I suppose. But I thought the message of the cross, redemption and grace was pretty evident at the end. I think subtlety is sometimes a better medium that yelling at people. IMO. I was a little disappointed in the speed of Rose' s reaction to Jed's sin. I will attempt to be vague so as not to introduce a spoiler but I think most people will understand my comment when they see the end of the film.

All in all, not a perfect film but one that I certainly appreciated and, unlike MANY, did not feel my time was wasted in viewing. I am not sure I liked it well enough to see again, but I do believe I can recommend to adults.

P.s. the quality of the music, (again IMHO), is excellent.",1447459200,,2714,4.612836438923395

6870319,2,B00QHIRRSC,"Ok so I feel that people give this movie a high rating because they are religious. So am I, but it felt like a kind a one sided story, black and white sort of morality. I just find that life is not this simple if it is I sure am not living it lol. Really cheesy and the deep back ground voice kind of turned me off. The movies conclusion says we should fear god and that he is judging all that we do. Well I don't fear god I love him, he is a friend, a voice that is always there telling you the right way to do things. So all in all think this movie has bad messages in certain regards.

Fame and fortune brought heartbreak and despair for Jed and Rose, but with God's grace they find their way back to each other.  Covers adult situations, but without any nudity, sex (implied only), or cursing.  I would say it gives a truthful picture of adultery and how it affects a marriage. I love how part of it is set in a vineyard, which if you read the Song of Songs you know that Solomon and his Beloved use a vineyard to describe their passionate love for each other.  Visually that made it even more symbolic.  My husband and I had some great discussions after watching this together.

I can't believe the music was even called music. More annoying than the movie is all the good reviews that led us to give this a try.,1432512000,7,419,4.25

6870439,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I've seen this movie twice. Based on the Book of Solomon (Old Testament book in the Bible), it tells the story of a young man searching for fulfillment in everything but his family. His relationship with his wife is the other important 1/2 of the story. Fortunately, like Solomon, he comes to his senses and there is a wonderful outcome",1428624000,,336,4.616666666666666

6870448,3,B00QHIRRSC,"The Song spends most of its time outside the bounds of most Christian films, exploring more serious and darker themes of human meaning, troubled relationships, loneliness, and happiness. The real heart of  the movie, however, is a celebration of music, particularly roots-style hybrid of bluegrass/americana/country/rockabilly.  The movie is filled with real musicians playing real music - you are not watching good-looking lip-synchers here.

The movie is based on Ecclesiastes, and to a lesser extent, the Song of Solomon. The viewer will easily predict  the plot, which follows the outline of Ecclesiastes chapter 2: a young man seeking wisdom and meaning through hard work, wealth, romantic love, and ultimately finding them all meaningless. Verses from the two books propel the action, which is both a strength and a weakness: they are profound, but you sometimes wish the director was a little more subtle, and the actors more skilled, as to not require leading the audience by the hand (viewers can tell which character plays the role of King David, they didn't have to name him David King)

Ecclesiastes is one of the most complex, difficult,  and interesting books in the Bible. The Song is pretty faithful to its themes. The author of Ecclesiastes (The Teacher) was a world-weary, lonely sage, who suffered from bouts of cynicism. He despaired of mans chances to gain anything of real meaning or permanence in the world (even wisdom) through human effort, and instead recommended  a healthy appreciation for the simple pleasures of life : food, wine, and the wife of your youth. The film follows these sentiments, although Jeb, the hero, has better luck with the  ladies than did The Teacher , (though he handles his wine rather less well.).

The film is darker and more complex, and a little more subtle (except at the beginning, which my non-Christian spouse called 'schmaltzy') than most Christian films, with a soundtrack that is considerably more substantial than in most films. A key character of Rose (the wife) is totally one-dimensional, and the only really good actor is the wayward violinist Shelby, who does her best to pull Rose out of being a one-dimensional charater. The films handles issues of adultery, marital intimacy problems,  and drug use and suicide with exceptional sensitivity, one you wish mainstream films would follow.

Altogether a worthwhile, though flawed film.",1427673600,5,2403,5.183462532299742
6870449,4,B00QHIRRSC,"Most Christian films make me sigh and roll my eyes, but I am encouraged to see the quality start to improve.  The acting in this film was very good and the characters felt real.  Some of the music was mediocre, but still not bad.  What pleased me the most, though, was how they used the film to illustrate the Scripture readings (which surprisingly work out well, too), rather than being so preachy as Christian films tend to be.  I also liked that they didn't tie up things with a pretty bow at the end with everything being happily ever after.  Though it was brief, there was the acknowledgement that it would take time to restore their relationship.",1427673600,,652,4.538461538461538

6870504,5,B00QHIRRSC,The Song is a top notch production that I highly recommend. The forever relevant perspective fixating message of Ecclesiastes is masterfully depicted in this poignant narrative of a man who tunes his heart to the frequency of truthful wisdom amidst a cacophony of spurious vanities. The applicability of truth is never more irrelevant when there is nothing new under our sun.,1425945600,,375,5.163934426229508

I absolutely love this movie. It is my favorite Christian film to date. I never knew that Alan Powell from Anthem Lights had never acted before. He did an awesome job. I also loved the fact that he kept his integrity with his real-life wife and did not kiss the actress in the movie. The person he kissed on the honeymoon scene was actually his wife. This really impressed me. I would highly recommend this movie. It's not necessarily a ""feel-good"" movie in the traditional romantic sense. But it's real and raw, very authentic in the world we live in. I think it represented ""real"" life very well. I bought this movie to show my parents and to have to watch time and time again.

6870586,4,B00QHIRRSC,"In ""The Song"", the main protagonist is a man named Jedidiah (Jed) King, who is a struggling country singer/songwriter trying to escape the shadow of his famous father.  The film features several biblically-themed love songs which are performed by the actors and are very catchy.  The relationship between Jed and his love interest - the local vineyard owner's daughter Rose Jordan - is initially sweet, believable, and came across as genuine.  The genuine feel remains even as their relationship begins to deteriorate due to his long absences while touring and his eventual infidelity.  While Jed does try to restore their relationship in the end, it is clear in the movie that the pain he inflicted on Rose did not fully go away, and was not healed magically at the end, adding an element of realism to the film that I appreciated.

At times, the film was predictable.  There were not many surprises in the plot, but the writing was not corny and the performances were believable.  One complaint my wife has is that much of the movie is spent on Jed's failures and his descent into adultery and drug use, and the restoration of their relationship felt rushed.

The main themes in the movie are the corrupting influence of fame and money, the pain that infidelity causes in marriage, and the power of forgiveness.  I ended up enjoying the experience and felt that as a film it accomplished the goal it set and that it told a compelling love story.

The film is rated PG-13.  I believe this is an appropriate rating.  While this film does not riddle us with scantily dressed teenagers or have any foul language, it does have some drug and alcohol use as well as some suggested philandering.  I would recommend ""The Song"" to folks who are over 12.",1424044800,9,1745,4.7194719471947195

6870591,5,B00QHIRRSC,"It is hard not to have low expectations when going to see a ""Christian"" film as they are typically low budget/quality and absolutely predictable.  And though the movie was predictable, it pulled the heart strings, put things in perspective and brought the message home very clearly.  Hats off to Kyle Idleman (not a fan / H20 ) for putting together a great movie accompanied by decent Christian tunes (another thing hard to come by).

Unfortunately, it didn't get a very much notice in movie theaters as organizations like Outreach.com tend to cheap out on advertising (ironic - since that is the only thing they do)  and think that simply sending cards in the mail to church leaders is going to bring people to the theater.  As a result, most people have never heard of this movie and don't know it exists.",1423872000,5,807,4.695035460992908

6870593,2,B00QHIRRSC,"It's refreshing to have a story of redemption like the book of Hosea; a saved marriage. The tragedy of this movie is the lack of clarity of the Gospel and the name Jesus Christ. No, not the cursing of Him, but the very name by which we are saved. Acts 4:12 (ESV) - This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  TBN should be ashamed of this fact. How are we to lead men to Christ, if we vaguely used the name ""God"" ""He"" ""Him"" but never actually use ""Jesus"". It's great to have link after the movie, but why not give people a chance to decided during the movie by being absolutely clear about the Gospel?",1423785600,8,778,4.152317880794702

6870605,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I personally have not seen the movie ""yet"" except for the previews. And it looks truly amazing, I can't wait for it to come on dvd,  which is in a few short days. I've read the song of songs, and first saw the previews at Creation fest, and was like ""wow, that movie looks amazing"". From all the reviews, it sounds like an excellent film!! Can't wait to see it., and i hope to see more christian moves just like these in future, i wish they'd reach all over the United States, to help reach the ""lost get found"". Thanks for reading!! :)",1423180800,,536,4.203883495145631
6870606,5,B00QHIRRSC,"My friend and I traveled 62 miles to see this movie because it wasn't playing anywhere near us! And it was well worth the gas money! This movie is spectacular in all aspects. The acting, the music, the story line pulled right from the Song of Solomon- are all flawless in my humble opinion. Even in a slew of biblical movies released last year, I think this one stands out as one that many couples could enjoy together. I've had a countdown going to the DVD release, and I'll be first in line :)",1421884800,,495,4.276595744680851
6870607,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This movie was excellent!  I saw the trailer, and could hardly wait to see it, but was nervous that it wouldn't be as good as I was hoping it would be.  Well, The Song did not disappoint.  By far the best Christian movie I've ever seen, and one of my all time favorite movies of any genre.  I loved how raw and real it was, and how connected I felt with all of the characters.  I also loved how scripture was woven through the movie, and how much symbolism was present.  The Song was so well made, and every element felt well thought out and intentional.  I am hoping that my husband gets me the DVD for Valentines Day *hint, hint,* and we plan to buy a copy as a part of every wedding gift we give.",1421539200,2,699,4.0583941605839415

6870610,5,B00QHIRRSC,Awesome movie!  It was refreshingly innovative to see the scripture message weave through the lives of the characters on screen.  Placing the Biblical story in contemporary daylight helps us to see that life isn't too different today from what it was....  timeless.,1421539200,,265,5.261904761904762
6870611,5,B00QHIRRSC,"Quality....This movie was fantastic!!! I saw myself and my husband so much in these characters. As our marriage has survived infidelity as well. This movie depicts love, forgiveness, and restoration that can only be found through Jesus. I Loved the scripture reading throughout as well as the raw, but truthful feel of the film. Thanks for this movie! Can't wait for it to come out!!",1421452800,8,383,4.907692307692308

It was written and directed beautifully and the music was wonderful. I am impressed with the high level of craftsmanship that this movie was made and so thankful that it wasn't cheesy like you have seen in the past with other films. I recommend every person who is married to see this movie and to really think about what it shows a marriage can go through when we fall into temptation and how we can pull ourselves up from the bottom! Great movie ad worth every penny you spend! Thank you for making this film...

6870615,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This is such a powerful, well told story about how little things can grow into big things in our marriage if we don't pay attention. My wife and I both really enjoyed this film. It was the kind of movie we were still talking about days later.

Great music, a compelling story, and great performances (especially Nashville's Caitlin Nicole-Thomas as temptress Shelby Bale) make this film so worth watching for any and all couples. Looking forward to getting the DVD.",1421452800,,465,4.8125
6870616,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I loved the movie. I can not wait for it to be released on DVD. The music is original and the performances are quite memorable.  The cast was mostly unknown to me, but the acting was very believable. The Song will change your life and your marriage. The message will stay with you a long time after the credits are over.",1421366400,5,320,4.245901639344262
6870617,5,B00QHIRRSC,"As much as one might have enjoyed the message behind most films in the Christian genre, it's sometimes necessary to forgive the Lifetime movie feel of the production and acting. While admittedly, movies in the genre have gradually been improving, THE SONG is so far, the best I've seen. It's PG-13 for some suggestive situations and drug/alcohol use (so it's probably inappropriate for very young audiences), but it is by far, the most gritty, real-life representation of the struggle to keep love alive in a fallen world that could be shown while not turning away its core demographic. While not being preachy, it speaks volumes about the temptations we face every day and how easily relationships can fall apart when both partners aren't doing what they can to keep love alive. The music is wonderful, the acting is solid, and the story is appealing enough to keep both church-goers and secular audiences engaged. Grab your friends (and some Kleenex) and see this movie! You won't be disappointed.",1421366400,5,999,4.9880239520958085
6870618,5,B00QHIRRSC,"Absolutely, without a doubt, loved this movie.  No, it isn't lighthearted and it doesn't go easy on the realities of adultery; but, it gives a realistic and honest hope for the viewer.  We took some friends to this and trust me, it speaks right to the heart.  As for the acting, it's superb.  The singing is actually done by the actors as they are all accomplished singers in their own right.  You can't go wrong with this movie.",1421366400,,429,4.448717948717949

6870621,5,B00QHIRRSC,"Such an incredible movie. Definitely the best Christian film I've ever seen! The acting is excellent, the storyline is fascinating and not at all predictable or cheesy. I sincerely hope they make more movies like this! A breath of fresh air!",1421366400,,241,4.902439024390244
6870622,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I am not a frequent moviegoer, and some of the faith based films I have seen have been somewhat cheesy. To my delight, the acting, character development, plot and music in the Song were first rate.  The temptations, moral failings and relationship issues were realistically portrayed as were the consequences.  The songs were very well written and performed, and the concert scenes were great.  I will purchase the DVD as I want to see it again.",1421366400,,445,4.828947368421052
6870623,4,B00QHIRRSC,"This movie is REAL. That's what makes it stand out from many other Christian films. The storyline shows what many marriages fall into when life and all the daily temptations happen . The music is fantastic, the acting great and the message SPOT ON! Saw it in theater twice. Will watch this DVD many times. Perfect date night movie....and be ready to have some deep conversations afterwards.",1421366400,10,390,4.835820895522388
6870624,5,B00QHIRRSC,So excited that this is finally coming out on DVD. I loved seeing it in the theater and will love watching it over and over. The message is strong without being overbearing. I was inspired and challenged at the same time.,1421366400,,221,4.414634146341464
6870625,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This is a great film! I love that it shows the good, the bad & the ugly and ends with a positive message about forgiveness and redemption. The performances were great. And I was surprised by how much I loved the music!  Great film!",1421366400,,231,4.25
6870626,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I saw this movie and enjoyed it. I took my husband, who didn't know anything about it but the name, so he didn't know what to expect, which was fun. He came away and thanked me for suggesting it, The movie is well produced and acted and hits on the real issues that people struggle with. It brought up many aspects of how we treat each other and the temptations that have been and will always be in this world to be self focused. And near the end I did shed a tear..I would recommend this movie to all adults, married or not.",1421366400,,525,4.106796116504855
6870627,2,B00QHIRRSC,"Please understand, I am a Christian, I am a pre-marriage counselor, and I most often go easy on Christian movie reviews noting budget restrictions and so forth. Also, I watched this movie at a special screening at a Marriage encounter at an outdoor plantation under the stars on Maui. In other words I should have fallen backwards into a no brainer great movie experience.

It just wasn't very good.

The many reviewers here are correct that the movie is well filmed, the acting is pretty good, and much of the music is good.

However, the story line is dark and the link to Ecclesiastes more often than not, felt forced. I also found the movie depressing as it overplayed this man's sin particularly his adultery, or at least it follows his fall in painstaking and seemingly laborious detail. Certainly this covers real life issues, but almost to the point of ""shock"" value.

I think it is important that folks be forewarned about this before purchasing that this is not a feel good movie. If you are okay with this, then you may ""enjoy"" the film like so many others here did. My wife and I ... not so much. We enjoyed Fireproof much, much more.",1421280000,19,1146,4.575609756097561
6870628,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I would hope this generation can catch a glimpse of what love is supposed to be like according to how God meant it to be, which is perfect and whole. Reminding us what real and true love is like, not a fairy tale, like we imagine, but only perfected when God is at the center of a relationship between husband and wife. This movie is a modern day reflection of one of the most misunderstood books of the bible. It is a must see movie for those looking for real love and the meaning of true intimacy.",1421107200,,499,4.154639175257732
6870629,5,B00QHIRRSC,This movie was so powerful!! I was telling everyone to see it but It was at such a limited amount of theatres and not there very long. The movie did an amazing job at portraying the journey that a couple can go through from falling in love to the challenges that can face a marriage and the redemption that a marriage can experience when they turn back to each other. I think it is such a wonderful tool to have young married people watch to give them wisdom on how to protect their marriage and guard their marriage against the trappings of the world. I can not wait to order one for my family.,1420848000,,595,4.228070175438597

6870631,5,B00QHIRRSC,"We loved this movie in the theater and can't wait to get it on DVD. My husband and I were going through a very rough patch in our young marriage. After seeing it we went to a parking lot and just talked and talked and cried before going to pick up our 3 month old baby from the babysitter.
The beginning was light, funny, and happy. The middle was extremely emotionally taxing but for the end it was worth it. This movie does not sugar coat love and marriage and the very real struggles that occur with these.
The music is great; the cinematography is great.
I would definitely recommend any couple (young or old, Christian or not) to watch this movie!!",1420848000,2,653,4.360655737704918

I can't say enough about this, it had a lot of great points and kept you ""in the movie"" the whole 2 hours, no low or slow parts.  The message came through beautifully without being ""preachy"".  While this is a ""Christian"" movie, don't let that stop you from seeing it!!  The music was excellent as well!  There's not ONE bad thing I have to say about it!",1420761600,,420,4.3896103896103895

6870634,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I saw ""The Song"" twice in the theater and have been waiting ever since to have it come out on DVD. The Song is about the truth of relationships... that it isn't always easy, that you have to work to keep a good marriage, and that temptation is ever present. It is a modern tale based on a very old story - the Song of Solomon. The music, the characters, the setting, the actors, the storyline... I loved it all and I can hardly wait to own it.

If you have not read or studied the Bible, this movie will inspire you to begin your journey. My husband and I saw the movie twice in theaters and have pre-ordered the dvd. We also purchased the couples devotional kit and movie soundtrack.

This movie is great for couples, but it is even more than that. It is for everyone. It reminds us of the power of each of the fruits of the spirit. It teaches us about love, trust, responsibility, pain, forgiveness --- and back again to the most important thing --- LOVE. Get this movie.

Things that are truly important in life SHOULD be portrayed, upheld, taught, perpetuated, and expected of us all. This movie selects one of the most important elements of life, marriage and the family, and shows us how we can overcome even the darkest and most violent storms of life.

Without getting to detailed, I just want to reiterate how wonderful this movie was for my life and marriage.  I had zero idea of what God created the marriage relationship to be and this movie opened my heart to the Song of Solomon, to God's instruction on how to awaken love, how to love and how to accept love.

6870671,5,B00QHIRRSC,"This past year I've done a few bible studies on Song of Solomon, when this movie came out I was beyond excited to see it.

I took a friend to see this movie & blown away by it! It's saturated with the gospel & beautiful!!! God used this movie in my life.",1420675200,,254,3.8846153846153846
6870672,5,B00QHIRRSC,"I went to see a pre-release showing of The Song. I was excited to go on a working date with my husband but my expectations weren't very high for the movie. I had read as much background on it as possible and what I had read left me a bit skeptical. In all honesty I thought it was probably going to end up being a bit cheesy.

The story is a modern day retelling of the life of Solomon based on the books of Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon. I read that the main character's name is Jed (short for Jedidiah aka Solomon) and his father's name is David King. The girl he falls in love with is Rose Jordan who's family owns a vineyard just outside of Sharon, Kentucky. (Yep, she's the Rose of Sharon.) The interloper is Shelby Bale (as in worshiper of Baal). One of the biggest surprises was that these cliche names actually added a depth to the story that I wasn't expecting.

The opening scene features David King in all his glory. He's a well known star that has everything . . . fame, fortune, talent. But what he really wants is what he can't have, his neighbor's wife. These opening scenes are gritty and real in their depictions of that life of debauchery. What really makes the message powerful is that you don't hear the character's speak, what you do hear is the voice of Jed speaking passages from Ecclesiastes over the gut wrenching story playing out.

Several scenes later we meet the adult Jed. He's a struggling musician trying to make it in the shadow of his father. As a way to make ends meet he reluctantly accepts a gig at a festival at the Jordan family's vineyard. There he meets Rose. I'm not going to give away too much about this but let me just say that an ex-boyfriend of Rose's shows up at the festival with another woman in tow. The way Jed puts him in his place is worth the price of the ticket in itself. I was swooning in my seat. Let me tell you, every woman I know wants a man to stand up for her like that. Not an ounce of blood was shed, but the sword went deep.

By this point in the movie I had a smile plastered on my face. But of course if you are familiar at all with Solomon's story you know what lies ahead. A great sorrow began to fill me. At times I wanted to stand up and yell at the screen, ""Don't do it!"" But of course they did it.

Another aspect that I appreciated was that it clearly showed that while Jed was the most responsible, Rose, her father, and even Shelby had roles that they played in the downfall. Jed should have said no and walked away. Rose should have been with her husband. Rose's father should have insisted she be with her husband. And Shelby should have left a married man completely alone. I truly wanted to weep for all that they had lost.

That's all that I'm going to tell you about the movie because I don't want to give away anything. I want you to experience it as I did and enjoy how the story unfolds. But let me assure you there wasn't even an ounce of cheese involved. The acting is believable and the music is over the top good. This is a top notch film that every couple should see. What you shouldn't do is bring your little kids.

The film has a PG 13 rating. This is a steamy romantic movie that doesn't cross the line. What I mean by that is the characters cross the line time and time again but in depicting those scenes the movie itself doesn't cross the line. There are no swear words. There is no nudity. But there is drug use, drinking, and implied sexual activity. I'm sure there will be Christians that do not like it because of these scenes. But I am telling you that when the credits rolled, I was left with a sense of gratitude that we serve such a loving God of the second chance. Not one of us is above falling into a similar snare. All I wanted to do afterwards was express my deep love for my husband and crack open my Bible to again read the account of Solomon's life.",1420675200,354,3867,4.1965006729475105
