8329992,2,B001O9BGPE,Video quality poor.....audio did not match up with video. No visual demonstrations. The author only sat there and talked at you and rambled on. There was nothing to be learned from this video...Don't bother buying it...,1380153600,2,219,5.111111111111111
8329993,2,B001O9BGPE,"I have to agree with the other negative reviews. Not only does she provide little actual instruction, she sits behind a desk so that you never see what she's doing when she does instruct! The constant chit-chat is annoying, too. This woman has a wealth of information to give an I wish she'd redo the video. Although it's pretty obscure, I was able to get the DVD through my library's statewide loan system; I suggest anyone try to rent before buying.",1354838400,2,451,4.580246913580247
8329994,2,B001O9BGPE,"I was very disappointed with this video!  I did not get anything out of it, especially what I wanted to learn.",1339113600,2,110,4.238095238095238
8329995,5,B001O9BGPE,"I purchased the Basic Rag Rug Crochet book along with the DVD. They work wonderful together if you are just starting to make crochet Rag Rugs I recommend getting them together to learn how to cut, connect and crochet your rag rugs, with patterns to get you started. Going from small metal thread hooks to the large size 'P' & 'Q' hooks for crocheting with fabric strips was a nice change making your projects go quick from start to finish you can make a beautiful rug to be cherised for many years.",1327536000,,498,4.423913043478261
8329996,1,B001O9BGPE,"Based on the previous reviews, I purchased the Basic Crochet Rag Rug Instructional DVD.  I just finished viewing it and was very disappointed in the quality of the video and she did way too much talking about nothing of importance.
Save your money.  You could get the same ""how to information"" on the internet or U-tube for free.",1319241600,4,329,4.655172413793103
