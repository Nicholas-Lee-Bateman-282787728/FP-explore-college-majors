3913612,5,B002DVP7T8,"Two great movies based on beloved children's books. ""Hook"" (a modern telling of a now grown up Peter Pan) and ""The Indian in the Cupboard"" (a story about one boy and his life-changing magic cupboard). If you love a good story that's also suitable for families and people of all ages, you can't go wrong here.",1394064000,2,308,4.517857142857143
3913613,5,B002DVP7T8,our children love these two movies and like watching them over and over  this is a good deal for the money and if you are trying to teach your children spanish or french you could change the language settings in the menu bar.the fact that they want to watch it over again tells us they have got to be learning something!,1390608000,,320,4.245901639344262
3913614,5,B002DVP7T8,Loved the combo movie...great shows for the whole family.  These are movies we enjoyed with our kids and now our grandkids.,1377561600,,123,4.857142857142857
3913615,5,B002DVP7T8,"Packaging these two films together was an interesting marketing choice.  I really could see Hook and Jumanji together versus these two, since Indian in the Cupboard is a different sort of film all together.  Hook and Jumanji are true kid action films, and Robin Williams and his cast are adorable (although I think there are one or two sort of bad words in Hook, easily lost in the fray).  Indian in the Cupboard is truly a remarkable film about a darling boy whose heart is captured, like yours will be, by the little plastic figurine who magically comes to life by being put in an old cupboard.  The values taught in this film transcend the best sword fight, and the relationship built on trust and respect the boy and the Indian develop are the real story here...the ending is just as poignant as any grown-up classic and will leave you with a few tears.  Can't recommend enough...",1376352000,4,884,4.6050955414012735
3913616,5,B002DVP7T8,Great..my first set of kids loved both..my 2nd set also love it..would definitely recommend buying this for kids great lessons taught,1367280000,,133,5.380952380952381

3913618,5,B002DVP7T8,Our family loves both these movies. Hook can be a little scary for younger children. Love Robin Williams' portrayal of Peter. Indian in the cupboard is a great imaginary tale.,1362528000,,175,4.866666666666666
3913619,5,B002DVP7T8,I really think this was a good purchase.  I was happy with the quality of the DVDs and the price I paid.,1357344000,2,104,3.727272727272727
3913620,5,B002DVP7T8,Good family oriented entertainment.  Hook has Robin Williams at his best (to me).  My grand kids enjoyed the INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD; it kept them entertained throughout.,1314316800,4,169,5.222222222222222
3913621,5,B002DVP7T8,"Two classic family movies packaged together in one set.  Please note:  Both of these movies are on separate DVDs in one case.  NOT two separate cases.  Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman are excellent in Hook.  Always a fun movie to watch and be reminded not to grow up and act too old!  The Indian in the Cupboard is one of my personal favorites.  Not as popular a movie, but such a wonderful adventure.  It's packed full of all kinds of emotions centering around friendship.  A great movie find.",1291420800,10,496,4.545454545454546

8366171,5,B002DVP7T8,I wanted to get my daughter some older movies that I used to watch & enjoy when I was growing up (Born 1989). I was very excited when I found this combo since bith are great movies for kids. Hook : any kids mivie with Robin Williams is a bestseller. Indian in the Cupboard : This was one of my favorites. I lived the book growing up & the movie even more. I think more kids should see this movie & it will become one of their favorites too.,1527897600,,440,3.955056179775281

8366174,5,B002DVP7T8,"Indian in the Cupboard is an engaging, exciting, yet sensitively depicted story of a boy's discovery of a magical key that unlocks a cast of characters  in haunting situations that you'll never forget.  Viewing the movie with my own son, years ago,  and now my grandson, gave me the opportunity to discuss diverse people, as played out by historical figures who come to life, and the unanticipated  and unintended consequences of our actions. Adults enjoy this film as well as children.",1514764800,,486,4.962962962962963
