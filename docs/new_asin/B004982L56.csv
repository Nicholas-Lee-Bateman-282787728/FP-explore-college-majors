All the movies present decent stories, but half of them have really lousy audio and video quality, and none of the movies offer subtitles to help.
***And here's one interesting example of deceptive advertising...***
Minesweeper, ""Starring"" Robert Mitchum -- I like Robert Mitchum and was looking forward to seeing him in one of a handful of WW2 movies I hadn't seen yet. It was one of the reasons I bought this set. Well, he was un-credited in the credits, recognizable in only a few group scenes, and never uttered a word. The DVD case said, ""Seaman Chuck Ryan (Robert Mitchum) adds to the drama in this adventure film."" Yeah, he was blown up by a mine halfway through the movie. And this was one of the movies with bad A/V quality. From IMDB: The failure of the original copyright holder to renew the film's copyright resulted in it falling into public domain, meaning that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHS/DVD copy of the film. Therefore, many of the versions of this film available on the market are either severely (and usually badly) edited and/or of extremely poor quality, having been duped from second- or third-generation (or more) copies of the film.
