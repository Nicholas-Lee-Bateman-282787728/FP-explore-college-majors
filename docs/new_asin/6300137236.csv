208429,5,6300137236,I loved this movie.  I remember becoming enthralled by it when I was younger.  A beautiful Romeo/Juliet type film with fairies and magic.  Lovely art shown during the credits make you wish to own everything related to this film.,1011225600,3,228,4.794871794871795
208430,5,6300137236,"i though that this movie was made so beautifully. The story is like that of Romeo and Juliet, but it is the animation that sets it apart from the rest of the other cartoon movies made. It is just a beautiful movie to watch i love it!!",1011225600,2,234,4.0
208431,5,6300137236,"This was the first anime I EVER watched and it took me forever to find out the title. It took even longer to buy it since it's out of print. The animation, though sparse, is beautiful and fluid. The storyline is based on the legend of Sirius. It is totally captivating. I recommend this movie to people of all ages, but mostly those who are romantics at heart.",1004659200,10,360,4.3088235294117645

208447,5,6300137236,"I don't want to give too much away in case this review is being read by someone who hasn't seen it so I will just say I recommend it! It is a favorite from my childhood that I am happy to share with my son. Sometimes, we need a more creative break from the repetitive Disney formula that seems to get repeated in every movie they make. This is an old classic with an unpredictable story line that children and adults can enjoy.",1399852800,,427,4.156626506024097
208448,3,6300137236,"I vaguely remember renting this when I was a little boy and was really excited when I finally found what it was called after searching forever online. I bought it immediately and made my boyfriend at the time watch it with me. This movie is really good, but it's a lot longer than I remembered and parts of it are slow. He fell asleep. I held on till the end, but for the last 30 minutes I was struggling to stay awake. It's a very beautiful film, but could be better.",1398211200,,468,4.153846153846154
208449,5,6300137236,"I remember this movie from when I was a kid.  As a kid my parents use to take us to the movie renal store once every Friday so long as we had been good and would let us pick out one movie and one video game to rent for the weekend.  With out a doubt I would pick this movie every weekend until it disappeared from the store (I assume because the tape broke or someone complained about it).  For the last 15 years I have been trying to find it and my biggest problem was that it had been so long since I'd seen it that I couldn't remember the name of the movie or the characters in it.  Through a stroke of luck and a lot of time on IMDB I found the title, came to Amazon and found this.

I could not be happier with this purchase!",1391040000,,730,3.84

I can not believe i found this movie again after all this time!! i thought i was not made anymore and to find in dvd form, i am so happy.  I am glad to share this now with my sisters kids who are 5 and up in age. Very cute story. But for under 4 years, u may want to review this for 2 short scary parts. Not very scary, but for a young child, they may want to fast forward these parts. Good purchase!",1383264000,,470,3.7

208464,5,6300137236,I've been looking for years to get a GOOD DVD copy of this anime. This was my favorite anime growing up and I still have the home recorded version on VHS. I was so excited to find it on DVD!,1374192000,,190,3.775
208465,5,6300137236,"This is, with out a doubt, one of the most amazing animated films for children I have ever seen. Loosely based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, this movie is beautiful visually and moving emotionally. A must see. But be warned, it IS a tragedy, so don't expect a happy ending. That shouldn't keep you from seeing this film though. I myself normally hate sad endings yet I still feel in love with Sea Prince & The Fire Child.",1373500800,,426,4.4743589743589745
208466,3,6300137236,I'm a hardcore Japanophile and was eagerly awaiting this. Unfortunately it was a little hard to watch because there were two clashing animation styles. The hero Prince Sirius and Malta were drawn in a childish cartoonish way while background and other characters were meticulously and beautifully rendered. Plus the love story albeit romantic was a bit hard to swallow. Overall animation and colors are beautiful and the beginning's dramatic but ... this will not be in my permanent collection. Good video for practicing intermediate JP listening comprehension though.,1370995200,,568,5.465909090909091
208467,5,6300137236,recommend highly.  roo bad it's not on blue-ray. should have been by todays standard.  sound effects would be awesome in 7.1,1368576000,,124,4.857142857142857
208468,5,6300137236,I first saw this movie at least 20 years ago. It was a great movie for a young teen and I still feel this movie is as beautiful and classic as ever.

208476,5,6300137236,"A lush fantasy/mythological version of Romeo & Juliet.  Like that tale, the ending is not the stereotypical happy ending, and there are losses along the way.  This makes it more memorable however than the standard mass produced fairy tales pumped out by Disney.  The tale is dare I say it better than Shakespeare's in terms of being approachable for children and young adolescents as there is no time period specific or cultural knowledge required.  By stripping the story to its core themes, it is more timeless for it.",1329868800,,520,4.875

208484,5,6300137236,"I rented ts movie first when I was seven or eight. I think I had it out of the store more often then it was in the store. It is one of those films that just calls to you when you are very young - especially if life has not always been so kind. It pulls at you, showing life and love in a way you understand at a deeper level then you imagine you can at that age. The visuals are lush, telling you more about these characters at times then the words they speak. While this is not full of action and explosions it is full of a mysticism that keeps young children spell bound for the duration.

The messages it teaches of love, sacrifice, and courage are ones you carry with you even into adulthood. Love can be painful, frightening, and often end in tears but this does not mean it is less worth the journey. Maybe I paint this movie too brightly. It does have it's flaws but overall, I think the grandness of it is in the honesty of the message that transcends cultural boundaries and speaks to anyone who has loved whether or not they have lost that love. I also think it warrants special note for its show of platonic and familial love as just as powerful and just as worthy of sacrifice as romantic love.

I highly recommend this amazing film.",1302480000,6,1245,4.205020920502092

208486,5,6300137236,"This is a good movie. However, it's basically the typical Romeo and Juliet story. I don't know if I'd let young children watch this???? Certain main characters die, and can be a shock to those not expecting it. It has a very unique feel to it, and at times can be sexy. Though there are no sexual scenes to it, there are times where you'll see to much skin, and nipples can be seen as well (at the end of this film). This is no problem for adults, but young kids????? I'm not bashing this film (what I had written above). I just want people to know what to expect. But yes, I enjoyed this film...and unfortunately certain parts drag on. I'm not a fan of the director (as other reviewers seem to be), so I'm judging this film on what I have seen it to be, and not by who has created it. Yes, I am glade that I had bought this film.",1295222400,,830,4.067073170731708

208489,5,6300137236,"One of my sons managed to get me to watch ""Sea Prince & the Fire Child"" some years back.
Much to my surprise, I really enjoyed it and also appreciated the moral lesson.  Since then,
I've watched much more and still believe that Japanese Annimation is the best. Also, give a
big thumbs up to the story focus and positive lessons they teach all of us, no matter the age.",1287792000,,368,4.257142857142857
208490,5,6300137236,"When I ordered the DVD, I wondered what the video and sound quality would be like. Here's my quick review for others who are concerned about the same thing...

This film has held up really well over time. The colors are rich and vibrant and the character and background design look vintage, but not dated. There is one scene where the image becomes unstable and ""jumps"" up and down on the screen and I caught a few dark spots on the upper right corner, but aside from these few glitches, the quality is superb.

I wondered what the dub quality would be like since it was recorded almost 20 years ago. Not bad. There are a few voice flaps and sometimes the performances are stilted, but this is not one of those heinous dubs created in the late 80s, early 90s. Like with most dubs, there are subtle differences between the Japanese and English scripts. These changes don't alter the story. The original Japanese audio is excellent (considering its age) and (as far as I can tell) the subtitles seem accurate.

The story itself is moving and magical. It's like Romeo and Juliet mixed with Hans Christian Anderson and Osamu Tezuka.",1285804800,9,1128,4.601990049751244
208491,5,6300137236,"I too saw this when I was a kid, and like the other reviewer said It stays with you. It is a Romeo-Juliet forbidden-love story that is very innocent and non-sexual though the fairies are naked. I should caution parents that the lovers commit suicide, but not in a bloody way (the  Sea Prince walks into sunlight to go after his love, and Malta carries his body into the water which Fire Fairies cannot be in. It is sad and lovely like the Shakespeare play.)

There are side stories with Malta's sister and the Sea Prince's best friend, separate from each other. They both die for the sister/friend they love.

I have been trying to get this movie for my kids for years but refused to buy an illegal copy from auction sites. There is a message to this story about loyalty, friendship, forgiveness, pride and consequences. It presents love and friendship as an eternal concept rather than just teenage rebellion. It is also very cute. I highly recommend it.",1281052800,3,955,4.605882352941176
208492,5,6300137236,This animated video has many feelings and it's so interesting. I could recommend this one for anybody else.,1278460800,,107,5.0
208493,5,6300137236,"This is a great classic film that mysteriously disappeared for a long time. In fact, most of the old Sanrio films disappeared. I saw it when I was very young in the early 90's, and I lamented the fact that it was never on DVD, but only om ancient VHS tapes or recorded from TV specials.

It's one of those films that, if you saw it as a young 'un, it stays with you forever, because it's so unlike most childrens' films. At times, it doesn't feel like a childrens' film, due to its dramatic elements.

It's a very delightful and heart-wrenching film, and I can't wait to add it to my DVD collection!",1277596800,28,599,4.245614035087719
208494,5,6300137236,"I loved this movie so much as a kid, that I spent years searching for it as an adult. This movie is so amazing and wonderful. I wish it was on DVD! This is a movie I was excited about sharing with my kids because I enjoyed so much at their age.",1271203200,,244,3.7115384615384617
208495,5,6300137236,"i love faeries, and anime, and this is the perfect combination of both. alright, there are definitely some flaws in the movie. the colours are kind of faded, the bad guy is cheesy, and as is typical of 80 cartoons the girl just whines instead of doing something, among other things. my mind was telling me this as i was watching... but a stronger voice drowned that one out and was wishing i'd seen this movie when i was five years old. i would have loved it then. i still appreciate it now, but there's something about a child's perception that makes magic come alive and this story is full of magic.

it's about the son of the sea king and the daughter of the fire queen. as legend has it, the king and queen are siblings and were very close and always together. the wind saw this, became jealous of their happiness and told lies to each of them making them distrust the other. they quarrelled and the fire queen went to live in the sky and the sea god the sea, and the wind was banished to the depths of the sea and his eye was removed. one day the prince of the sea goes to a forbidden place and sees the fire child watching over the eternal flame. he comes back the next day and they fall in love, and from there they try to find a way to make their impossible love work.

one of the things i love about anime is that it's not disnified. obviously. what i mean by that is that a romanticized ideal is achieved, but not without cost. there isn't a false message that you can have your cake and eat it too. you should strive to achieve your desires, but you have to know that there may be a price to pay. this isn't ominous by any means, don't take it the wrong way, the movie isn't sinister and won't worry a child. the moral isn't that bad will always come from getting something you want, but more that sometimes you have to choose between two things you might like and if you choose one you might mourn the loss of the other, even though the choice you made was the best one and is what will make you the happiest. this isn't always the message in main stream films. most of the time the idea expressed is that you go through a tough phase, but then by making the right choices all goes well in your life, happily ever after, without regret or pain or thoughts of what if. the story end with the idea that the couple will always be happy in their paradise, but in real life situations life isn't so black and white, and it's refreshing to see films reflect this every now and again, especially films for children.

 the fire people are all faeries, and all except for the fire queen have a sprite-like appearance. the prince is human looking, but very lanky, and all of his subjects are fish (so both boys and girls will watch). it was a great film full of fantasy, adventure, whimsy, and romance. great film.",1268092800,,2816,4.248134328358209
208496,4,6300137236,I remember watching this over and over and over again when I was a child.

When I could no longer get a copy as a teenager, I went through video stores checking to see if any had an old copy to sell out of their old vhs stock. No one did. I finally was given a vhs copy bought off the internet (this was late 90s; the option hadn't existed long and things weren't quite as easy to find - even today the video isn't common). I called a lot of publishers before that though. I learned that the reason it was unavailable was that the rights had been purchased by another entity in the 90s and the film was then put in moratorium (which basically means a company sits on a title until further notice). I could be wrong but I believe it was Time Warner. Like the reviewer above me, I think this film, along with similar animations, made a gigantic impact on my creative sense later in life.",1216252800,,864,4.148809523809524
