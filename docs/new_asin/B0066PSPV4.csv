8494204,5,B0066PSPV4,I'm a very advanced guitar player who took lessons from a NTU grad for over 10 years and have been playing in bands the better part of my life.  Danny Gill never fails to deliver.. even in a 'absolute beginner' video I'm learning a few good tricks.  Well worthwhile!!,1483747200,,267,4.428571428571429
8494205,4,B0066PSPV4,"I bought this DVD for my husband who is an absolute beginner with his first guitar. He says that the instructor seems very patient, taking you point by point, even though you get the feeling he could just take off and strut his stuff. Good video, showing both hands on each demo. He would like to be able to see placement of the fingertips more clearly. Audio is very good and each demo ends with the new chord, string or lick being played along with background music so you hear how what you are learning to play fits in. There seems to have been at least one lesson previous to where this instruction begins since the instructor mentions adding to what you already know.",1373673600,,672,4.42741935483871
