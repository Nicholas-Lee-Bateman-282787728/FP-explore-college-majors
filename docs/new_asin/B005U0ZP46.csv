4893246,5,B005U0ZP46,". . . tenth person to give this documentary five stars! And I know there will be many more.

The subject is heavy - 'what's wrong with our world and what can we do about it?' - But Tom manages to combine deep and profound ideas from great thinkers, humor and his own amazing story into an inspiring (this movie defines the word) global tapestry. It is going to be showing only a short time in our town. I'm sorry about this because seeing it with a crowd has a certain magic about it. And I would love to do it again. And again.

Every person Tom interviews contributes with intellect and heart, a word I have new respect for now. The editing was impressive and cohesive. I will enjoy re-reading ""The Field"" after seeing Lynne McTaggart.

I'm sure I will see many more lessons as I watch it again, but for tonight, my personal take-away is 'Be conscious and be aware of opportunities to respect and show compassion in any small way to just one living creature. In a word, love. I am and I can make a difference.'

This has been said before; it will be said again.  Tom has said it for this moment when we are so in need of hearing and doing anything that will be healing and helpful. He reminds us through his experience that grandness isn't necessary to make a difference. In fact, smallness is often the best way to affect our personal worlds in a big way.

Second take-away:  Living small with fewer wants is a good definition of freedom.

Thank you, Tom and all who worked with you.",1310947200,23,1486,4.3393501805054155
4893247,5,B005U0ZP46,"I saw this movie at the Dundee Theatre in Omaha NE.I was extremely depressed when I saw it. My fiancee had died 2 years ago and I had a heart-attack 2 days after he died and have had heart-problems ever since. My fiancee Bob had been in a very serious bicycle-accident that had left him in a coma and when he finally awoke he was never the same again-I had put it down to other things(his father was ill) and then blamed myself when Bob killed himself.
The Director of ""I Am"" had also had a biking accident and his description of post-concussion syndrome sounded exactly like Bob,and as I sat there in the theatre I was finally able to see this wasn't my fault. I thought to myself--""Now if only it would expain my heart problems"" and then it did;and then it explained what is wrong with the world and in the procees confirmed that everything I have come to believe is true!
I cannot reccommend this movie enuff!!!!",1310947200,164,915,4.3882352941176475
4893248,5,B005U0ZP46,"I was lucky enough to be taken to this movie when I was visiting friends and family in Colorado recently.  I will simply say that this is a movie that should be seen and discussed by everyone.  The film deals very humanely and provocatively with two simple, but very important questions:  ""What's wrong with our world?"" and ""What can we do to make it better?"".  Check out the trailer at the website [..] and see it in a theater if at all possible.  Then purchase the DVD (not yet available) and pass it around.  Kudos to Tom Shadyac for making his best movie ever!",1309132800,9,564,4.375
4893249,5,B005U0ZP46,"I am so grateful to be alive today, having died in a motorcycle crash in 1990.  This movie moves me in all the right directions, and selfishly I await the release to DVD so that I can share it with colleagues and clients I work with who have similar (and different) disabilities.  It is truly an important work for the author and for many others.  I was surprised it was not released to more mainstream theaters, but I guess this is how real life movies fare much of the time (spiritual in focus).  The world in general is not looking inside (much) yet.  Thanks for the great journey you shared with us, Tom.  I really can relate, on so many levels. Oh, and also thanks for the belly laughs with Ace Ventura, etc....ah, God laughs too!!!

4893251,5,B005U0ZP46,"...saw and lived this provocative and life-changing documentary, undoubtedly our world would be a much better place. This is the perfect response to the important life-long question ""How, then, shall we live?"" In a culture that celebrates youth and superficial values, I particularly loved how Tom interviewed some of the wisest people living today--and in most cases, they were over sixty.

An amazing blessing in my life was when I ran into Tom Shadyac at my daughter's Kenyon College graduation a few weeks after seeing the film (apparently, his nephew was graduating that same day); he was just as gracious and authentic in person as the movie depicted him to be. I can't wait to use it in my  English classroom next year, as I am confident that it will be a life-changer.",1306972800,39,776,4.827067669172933
4893252,5,B005U0ZP46,"I just saw this movie in a theater after seeing Tom Shadyac on Oprah and am inspired. Sign me up to purchase a DVD as soon as that is available because I want friends and family to see this life-changing documentary about love and connectivity and it won't in theaters much longer. For some reason (because it is an indie?) there hasn't been much press.

Powerful images of love and pain illustrate our visceral response to other humans and animals: I laughed, winced and shed a couple of tears.

Science only deals with what is measurable, but we all know there is much more to life than what can be counted. In fact, what can be counted doesn't count for much in the long run. This movie made me think about what really counts.

4893255,5,B005U0ZP46,"I saw Tom's interview on Oprah and immediately looked for theatre showings.  This documentary is life changing.  As Tom notes in the film, ""nature takes only what it needs"".  The giant redwood doesn't take all the nutrients from the soil, only what it needs.  The lion doesn't kill every gazelle, only what it needs.  The whole idea of living beyond ones needs is carried to the ultimate destruction of the host by cancer cells to the body and mankind to the planet.  I loved his story of how a herd of deer determine when and where to move to water or to feed.  True democracy in action.  Community, community, community!!  After the movie was over, everyone in the theatre stayed to watch the credits.  As the lights came up and the film ended, big hugs erupted as people were leaving.  Thank you, Tom, for a life-changing inspirational and educational experience.

BTW, I traveled a thousand miles to see this movie.  Wish it had a wider distribution.  John, New Mexico",1304467200,278,972,4.674556213017752

It should be mandatory for high school and college students to watch and discuss with profound thinking and conversation amongst each other.  Im a retired educator and if I was still teaching it would be the highlight of my school year to share such an important and impressive documentary with my students.

4893276,2,B005U0ZP46,"A wealthy Hollywood director recently discovered that the drive to accumulate more and more possessions does not bring happiness.  With all due respect, that is not a new concept, though he has embraced it as if it were his discovery.  He seems to think that all the evils of this world come from that mental illness that permeates the world, and with the same zeal he invested in directing movies, he has set out to enlighten the rest of us about this new and revolutionary two thousand year old idea of his.  Obviously, while he was convalescing
 in the hospital, he failed to notice all the doctors, surgeons, interns, nurses, orderlies, volunteers, cleaning and office staff that live by that self-evident truth every day of their lives to help heal the world.  Obviously, he has not walked down the street of any American town or city to see the millions of people who live quietly by that truth he just discovered.  I humbly suggest that there is another mental illness that wreaks as much havoc in the world as greed.  Worshipping the ego also causes a lot of damage.

Plus it feels good to make someone else's life a little better.
I know of one producer that made his documentary free, so the whole world would know the truth about the harm of a pharmaceutical.

As is common today, he uses science to justify his ideas,  it makes for a compelling case. However, the bigger ideas at the heart of the idea is more spiritual than scientific.

4893420,2,B005U0ZP46,"At first, I really like the movie, and it had a very powerful effect on me. However, the more that I thought about it, the more I realized that it does not live up to what the director said in the beginning. This was to understand the root cause of the world's problems and what we can do about it.

Unfortunately, it was just a one sided story about how we are all connected, should love each other, etc., and about a very rich, competitive man who decided that he didn't want to act like it.

One of my biggest issues is that they say in the movie cooperation is of greater importance than competition, and they totally minimize the natural human instinct for competition. Furthermore, they use the ideas of aboriginal people all over the world as evidence. However, it was the competitors that always took over their land. The competitive humans usually win in the end.

Additionally, they show a total lack of economic understanding. In fact, they even speak of the economy as though it is a bad and unnatural thing. This demonstrates an unbelievable amount of ignorance.

As one critical reviewer wrote on Amazon, they fail to present both sides of the story and either let us decide for ourselves or show why their side is better.

If you want a feel good love fest that hammers the successful (by a successful guy, by the way), see the movie. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",1466380800,,1383,4.560483870967742

4893452,3,B005U0ZP46,"I think this video focuses more on the symptoms, than an essence. Symptoms such as violence and helping each other, poverty, having enough or grabbing a lot because of insecurity, etc. It offers helping each other and not using enough as author thinks is fair as a solution. So movie is still based on scarcity and powerlessness mindset.
  Movie is set in same format as The Secret, sometimes I almost felt as if I was watching it. :)
  It touches on the fact, that we are all connected, however it misses the point of how WE ARE. We are beings, we are love, and we can connect to that love in the moment by simply releasing the thinking and experiencing life instead of thinking about it, by simply being. Of course, releasing old programing with EFT, EMDR and similar techniques can be helpful too, so when we choose to think, our thoughts are not tainted with culturally accepted limiting beliefs.. Using our mind and thoughts as a tool instead of being possessed by them is the answer.
 When we are connected to our essence we will naturally be loving, peaceful, abundant, and safe. We can never reach that through doing. Doing is simply an expression of what is inside. We can mimic that with action without presence behind it, but it will not give the same results and it will not fulfill us. No more than money or relationships can.",1454716800,,1339,4.5625

4893467,3,B005U0ZP46,"Good stuff here as far as his message goes about cooperation, consumerism, greed, love, competition, etc.  Shadyac's own epiphany and eventual lifestyle changes make for a good story and he interviews some impressive and admirable people here.  My problem is that when he ventures into the scientific realm, he gives a lot of time and credence to pseudoscientists; the scene with the yogurt 'responding' to his feelings of anxiety makes me laugh and cringe at the same time.  Hopefully why it makes me laugh is self-explanatory; it makes me cringe because he has this kind of thinking, this sloppy, New-Agey 'research', inserted into what could have been a stronger, truer, wiser and more meaningful film.  Why are so many people  afraid of complexity, edification, critical thinking?  Why do we in America so often need to sugar-coat so we that can stay 'positive'! (Insert smiley face emoticon here!)  Do we have so little faith in our intellects, are we so terrified of the messy truths of life? It isn't too much to ask for well-done and respected research in a documentary whose ambitious subject is ""what's wrong with our world and how can we fix it""?

The inaccuracies they claim science has made (flat-earth, heliocentric solar system), are by far the most frustrating. Well into B.C. era, still infantile science knew the shape, and even had a close approximation of the diameter, of the earth. It was myth-infested religion that negated those findings in lieu of ideas that didn't contradict their holy-books. And Galileo, Copernicus (and people like them in all but very recent history), the people who made great scientific advancements, were prosecuted for it by people who prefer this 'spiritual' way of intellectual suicide.

4893476,4,B005U0ZP46,"Film Review: I AM By Mayra Suarez
Tom Shadyacs documentary I Am (March 11, 2011) is nothing you would expect from a director who produced Ace Ventura or the Nutty Professor. Shadyac twists his talent to produce a documentary that will make his audience end up with an overwhelming feeling of reverence. His inspiration for this film came from his life after his traumatic motorcycle accident in 2007. After being unconscious for almost half a year, Tom Shadyac noticed that the world he lived in had a deeper, more powerful, meaning other than the superficial. He goes out and discovers that his wealth doesnt make him any happier than other people that are living a more modest, simpler life. With this, he wants to find out two big questions: what is wrong with the world and what can we do to make it better? His documentary depicts his adventurous journey to find the answers to these questions, to do so he traveled around the globe to interview intelligent minds such as Desmond Tutu and David Suzuki to name a few.  He discovers how amazing life is, and that is what makes this film such a great, distinctive documentary to watch.
This documentary is like no other, it shows a brighter and more remarkable side of humanity.  He discovers many wonders about the connections between human life and nature, leaving his audience in awe. His main point of the film seems to be the relationship between humans and every other living specie on this planet. Stephanie Crampin, a writer for the website Givingwhatwecan.com points out this idea and states, The idea he gets at is that people are brought up to be self-centered and function as individuals, but are actually more interconnected as a species than we might have believed.  One of the more archaic parts of the film that proved the connection was his experiment with yoghurt. Shadyac was connected by a voltmeter to a petri dish with yoghurt. His emotional reactions made the active cultures in the yoghurt respond to the waves he was transmitting.  This is quite a phenomenon! But what does yoghurt have to do with any of this? It illustrates the central idea of the documentary: humans are connected to Earth on a physical and emotional level. This unique experiment is just one of many phenomenal findings from Tom Shadyacs documentary.
This film provides many supportive examples for the overall central notion. Shadyacs journey takes him as well as his audience to places that we have never been and presents us with reality that we have never seen. This documentary does an efficient job of describing our western society. It paints a good picture as to how much we consume and want. The findings are gross. Stephanie Crampin does a worthy job explaining that we are conditioned to take more than we need and do it en mass as society, so that doesnt even strike us as greedy or decadent, but just normal. Shadyac finds out that other cultures take this consumerism as an illness. Motivated by his findings, he sells his mansion in Los Angeles, and lives a more modest life in a trailer park. This shows the audience the harsh reality of the society that we are all living in and praise.
Despite the films many strengths, the film has one major shortcoming. Even though Shadyac discovers many realities and wonders about the life on this planet, he leaves the audience with excitement about doing something, yet he does not show any real solutions. This film does a good job on raising my blood pressure and overwhelming me with wonder about the natural world, but at the end of the movie I felt like I did not know what to do. Shadyac forgets to show solutions to the crisis we are living in. Am I supposed to sell my house and live on a trailer? I don't think so. I am left with a feeling of wanting to help but because of the absence of solutions in his documentary I have a feeling of uncertainty of where to start.
I Am is spectacular all around. This is a marvelous, one of a kind documentary. This documentary aims at the people who are curious. Shadyac takes us on a journey to find two, almost impossible, questions and that is what is wrong with the world and what can we do to make it better? With great enthusiasm and curiosity Shadyac takes his audience around the world to search for the truth. What one can gain is simple, the central idea: that humans are all connected to each other and connected to everything around us. Shadyac implores, My hope is that I AM is a window of truth, a glimpse into the miracle, the mystery and magic of who we really are, and of the basic nature of the connection and unity of all things.",1445817600,,4602,4.615384615384615

But then presents a very hopeful view of human nature and very well-grounded research that the source of many of our societal problems are rooted in incorrect frames of reference from the past.

I enjoyed listening to Desmond Tutu - he's amazing - and others, and was a little surprised watching Shadyac's ego displays.  The big jolt (given that the video is meant to inspire and to build community) was watching the repeated videos clips of people being physically slashed or walloped in sensitive areas.  I found no comments about these violent parts in the reviews, and have tried to let go of some of these horrible, nightmarish images.  Folks, especially those with children, might appreciate knowing about this content.  Shadyac, who was making a point, could have done so with fewer and with less gruesome images.  Not being numb to watching violence, I am sorry I found no mention of it in reviews.  I  will not, in good conscience, pass this on to a friend, or anyone...",1433808000,8,943,4.771604938271605

4893516,5,B005U0ZP46,"I saw this documentary when it was first released and recently was discussing it with a friend when I realized, hey, I can purchase it and watch it again.  And in doing so, I actually watched it and took notes and reflected on what I learned the first time. This was an amazing insight into theories about what things we should be doing to promote good and compassion and cooperation. Having watched it again, I found myself re-motivated to ""be the change I wish to see in the world"". Some famous guy said that....

I think every high school senior should watch this. Perhaps by doing so, we can create a generation of individuals who begin to look differently at our connections and how cooperation can save us.

Extraordinary and recommended for anyone who wants to lead others, or does it as a result of just being on this planet. But well done in that it is funny, a little sad, and amazingly insightful.  Buy it so you can share it with others. ""You can blow out a candle, but you can't blow out a fire.""  We need to change the way we see things, or we will see our world changing to our detriment, and if we all take hold of our little piece of the world, we can together make a difference.",1433289600,7,1196,4.321428571428571

4893569,5,B005U0ZP46,"Watching this for the first time was a life-changing experience for me. I have a friend who likes to say that great literature ""re-arranges your mental furniture."" This film certainly did that for me.

I've watched the film several times now, and I've gotten a bit obnoxious about making house guests watch it with me when they fall into my trap (Hey, c'mon over... we'll have dinner... drink some wine... Oh, and I've got this film I think you'd like!)

In the media, in Congress, in the White House... everyone is struggling and fighting over all these difficult questions... BUT!  They're the wrong questions! I wish... I so wish... more people would watch this film and understand how the priority isn't something like promoting values we believe in while helping the economy. We need to radically rethink who we are as a species. Watching ""I Am"" helps a lot.",1422489600,3,863,4.778523489932886

4893576,5,B005U0ZP46,"Absolutely incredible, unique and deeply influential film that I, and everyone I have shared this documentary with, have found truly life-changing. A much needed look at the ways we as individuals, as a society, and as human beings can make a difference, or, at the very least, begin evolving our perspectives to make the changes that we will have to make. This is not a ""new age"" film, although I personally believe such categorizations as this are limiting and a form of stereotyping that restrains progressive thinking and individuality. This film is grounded in the rapidly growing research evidence on human consciousness, and is congruent with a mindful perspective, one based in reality, in an honest look at what is happening, as it is. Because after all, we don't see things as they are, we see thing as we are. Until we adopt a perspective of willingness to purposefully change and grow, we will continue to create destruction and suffering in our own lives, and in the world as a whole.

This film is not about contracting around our current opinions and views any further than we already have, it is not about clinging to old ways of thinking, but rather, it introduces the idea of change as within the reach of individuals, society and human beings as a whole. It briefly reviews the exponentially growing field of multi-disciplinary research supporting mind-body medicine and the interrelated nature of everything, and then derives from this research practical advice that applies to every single person here. It demonstrates that nothing and no one is isolated or alone, and the implications for this fact.

Furthermore, it was such an incredible relief to hear Tom speak about the culture of the rich and famous in a real way, grounded in reality, and with respect to the world as it really is. It was inspirational to hear about the changes we have made a society since we begin realizing that we, as human beings, are not the end-all, be-all, center of the universe, but are both part of, and dependent upon, something so much more intricately interconnected and complex. We look at how some of the greatest change came about in recent years (e.g. civil rights, woman's suffrage, industry) and how to apply these principles to create change today, tomorrow, and for years to come. We consider the perspectives that have created today's world, and those that will change it.

I highly recommend that you sit down and watch this documentary, giving it your full, non-cynical attention, and truly think about the messages within, even if they don't fit your current ideas. Willingness to grow and learn is an attitude we could all benefit from. At the very least, you will have the self-created boundaries of your current perspectives blurred and challenged in a way that prioritizes life, not any individual's life over another. This documentary will broaden your views, and help us to see with eyes of wholeness, rather than living within the illusion of our own minds. I think it represents a step in the ongoing world-wide evolution of human consciousness, and does so in a very powerful and practical way.  There is one quote toward the end of the film that really stuck with me, I thought I would share here. (This quote isn't a summary of the message of the documentary, but is one of many themes covered, which are reviewed graphically and spoken on by experts whom Tom interviews from around the globe).

There's one fundamental law that all of nature obeys that mankind breaks every day. Now this is a law that has evolved over billions of years and the law is this: nothing in nature takes more than it needs and when it does it becomes subject to this law and it dies off.",1421020800,,3699,4.809748427672956

This is one of those videos that I bought 10 copies of, and gave it to all the people I care about. I watch it several times a year, when I am feeling down about the world, (even more often since Fall of 2016). Whenever I hand it to people, I say, ""watch past the first 10 minutes"", because it has such a different tone than the rest of the movie.... he is setting the stage for the journey he is about to take us on. But the rest of the film is pure magic. I wish they would play it for free all over the U.S., we desperately need it right now.",1529798400,,714,3.831081081081081
