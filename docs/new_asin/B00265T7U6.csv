8352025,1,B00265T7U6,The first episode is beautifully clear- like watching it's first broadcast. The rest are very poor renderings. The shows are good and the stories are fun but I doubt you're going to want to rewatch them due to the poor copy quality.,1272412800,3,232,4.5476190476190474
8352026,3,B00265T7U6,"Like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/previous-collection/dp/B000OZ2D0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">previous collection</a>&nbsp;of Make Room For Daddy episodes from St. Clair Vision, this Best of Make Room For Daddy Collection (from Passport Entertainment) also contains complete classic episodes from the rarely seen Jean Hagen years with original commercials included. The episodes have been carefully re-mastered for best possible picture quality.

*Unfortunately, like the previous collection from St. Clair Vision, this set also includes ""The Sea Captain"" episode (from Season 1) again mistakenly labeled as ""Danny's Birthday"" (from Season 3). This is especially disappointing considering this set contains only 8 episodes, that's 2 eps less than the St. Clair Vision set which without extras but with more episodes was much cheaper than this set SUPPOSEDLY with extras.

Also, despite what the set's product description says, this collection does NOT contain any of the advertised special features listed on the back of the DVD. Emails to Passport Entertainment (the studio behind this set) inquiring about the missing bonus material have gone unanswered.

Bottom line: The Best of Make Room For Daddy Collection is a decent set (solely on the strength of the episodes included, the double dip of ""The Sea Captain"" not withstanding) which could've been better had Passport Entertainment included the missing Bonus Features and more episodes.

Here are the contents of this 2-disc set:

Disc 1:
Terry's Party
Margaret's Job
Terry Takes Charge
Danny Has a Baby

Disc 2:
Margaret's Aunt
Terry's Boyfriend
Little League
The Sea Captain*",1270339200,14,1684,5.966804979253112
8352027,4,B00265T7U6,"For those of us who grew up watching reruns of the later ""The Danny Thomas Show"" reruns featuring Marjorie Lord playing Danny's second wife, this DVD is a real treat.  One can't help but compare the early Jean Hagen shows to Marjorie Lord's episodes.  Interesting to see how the show changed through the years by not only adding Lord and Angela Cartwright to the family, but also developing a much-lighter sitcom feel to the writing and directing of each episode.
One thing about this DVD though - I can't seem to find the Bonus material on the two disc set.",1255219200,6,558,4.57
