The wife got upset because her fine husband was home working on his book while she had to work for their livlyhood. The more she worked, the angry she got. She grew cold to her husband affections towards her, and she forgot that the house they were living in was provided by him and the car, when he had money.

Now she is complaining about having to pay all the bills and he needs to go and get a job. She forgot to understand what he was trying to do, and she refused his tries of being a loving huband to her.

She got worse but she was keeping a big secret. Refused her husband phone calls and had secretary to lie she was busy at work. Then it happened, a man came to her car talking to her, to be together. The secretary was right on with wisdom and trying to keep her in line for her husband.

Then one day, since she would not take her husband's phone calls at work, he decided to go to her job to take her out to lunch, and he walked in on her hugging another man.  The crap hit the fan then...I'm going to stop  here. Dont want to spoil it 4 you.

A MUST SEE.  YOU WILL ENJOY.  ALL THOSE IN LOVE NEED TO SEE THIS.  IT IS TRULY A LESSON FOR ALL TO LEARN.

ENJOY!!!",1337212800,5,1300,3.9049429657794676

The two fresh actors I found a bit not as seasoned to the nines at every turn but by no means disappointing or mundane, and besides didn't a lot of big time actors and actresses come from silly comedies & horror movies that were plain plotless-just sayin'!

Women make your man watch it with you-Men make your woman watch it with you-Movie night chill the champagne, pop some popcorn or order hot wings, snug on the sofa a unwind and Enjoy!",1459209600,,736,4.533834586466165

Characters in this movie are Erica Giles, Aj Williams, Adam Rennie, Natasha Noreiga and more! Yes new faces! And they do not disappoint!

I came across this movie just by looking for great movies to watch. And did we enjoy this movie! Yes we did!

This should be required for all couples before and after marriage..., We invest in everything in this world, but where is our faith, and why don't we invest in marriage? We believe in everything this world shows us, but do not believe in marriage any more?

This movie was on point and to the point. This is a much needed movie in our current times of the status of marriages in all cultures, but especially in the African American culture.. you can and will learn a lot from this movie.

This marriage in this movie goes through challenges that are reality. This shows the solutions to those issues as well. The characters are great and do an excellent job. I want to see more movies like this on the same subject matter with the solutions because this is needed to save the marriages of today.. Too many give up and too many stand for nothing. Prepare for marriage, fight for your marriage. We fight for everything else, but don't fight for the most important investment we will ever make in life.

The movie is so deep and needs to be seen by couples who are thinking about marriage and ones who are married. This has great music, scenery, you name it this has it.. The movie is quality.

We are already watching this for a second time and will continue to watch this over and over again. This is clean truth that family and friends can watch together.. Start a save marriage campaign in your community.

Men do have feelings and we as women do need to ask our mates how can we help them. We may just think that they can handle things on their own. Even if they tell us they can, we still need to ask how we can help. We need to tell them what we think and not assume that they can read our minds.

We all change, but we should not let those changes tear our marriages apart. We need to grow together and not apart. We need to keep God in the center and remember that Honor begins at home. We need to keep our priorities in order.

Please make more movies like this.. They are needed.

Keep praying for all marriages to be restored to better than what they were and are.. The divorce rate in the African American communities is too high. Lets change this.. we can do it if we try and stand for something..

Buy one for yourself and buy more as gifts! From a married mother of more than four children.. stay prayed up, stay in the word and study the word. Keep God in your homes and in the center of your marriages and keep him first in your life.

Enjoy! Remember it does take men longer to mature.",1351728000,,2960,4.302158273381295
