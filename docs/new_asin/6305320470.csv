1009914,1,6305320470,"I picked this one up based on how much I've enjoyed every other MST3K videos I've seen, and thought that since this one was from the first season it could be kinda funny to see how the show looked in the begining.
Well  unfortunately, it wasn't.
You can see the jokes (the few that there  are) coming from a mile away, and they just don't have the same wit or  hillarity (is that a word?) as the later movies do.  And what was up with  Servo...with that slow monotone voice, he reminded me of an old teacher I  had in high school, and that isn't a good thing.
So Unless you're a  completist, I wouldn't bother picking up 'The Crawling Hand'.  It has the  distinction of being the only MST3K movie I've ever passed out while  watching.
I'd definately rather spend my money on Manos: The Hands of  Fate, Eegah, or the Pod People (just to name a few).",928454400,4,848,4.270440251572327
1009915,2,6305320470,"It's not a BAD effort, but it is from the first season (1989) and is really quite different than you may be expecting.  Tom Servo has a different voice, and they are all green in the foreground instead of the  black you may be used to seeing them in the theature.  They are also kinda  slow when it comes to offering jokes directed at the movie, so much so, you  find YOURSELF making funnier ones without getting in their way.  There are  much better ones, so get it if you are trying to finish off your  collection.",924307200,2,516,4.247422680412371

I have to give them a hand on this one, for this touching storyreally choked  me up.

1010152,2,6305320470,"This is a very early episode of MST3K... And even though I knew that the first few seasons weren't very good, I bought it anyway. I did laugh alot... but I barely made it though the movie... It was interesting seeing the old set though. The host segments weren't too funny... The invention exchange wasn't very funny or interesting. The riffs were pretty funny, but they made too many jokes about hands and Gilligan's Island(since the actor that played the skipper is in The Crawling Hand). And as for Josh Weinstein... well, his voice just isn't very funny. And I like Frank!(who doesn't appear in this episode)... Ok, I think that I am done now.

Besides,it couldn't have been that bad for  the show to get a second season.  Unlike most other people, I found this  early episode interesting to watch.  I didn't find Josh Weinstein annoying  in any way.  The host segments are good (except for the second one) and the  riffing is low but entertaining.  At least the riffing isn't as bad as  Shorts volume 1 (Shorts volume 1 being he worst MST3K tape available at the  time).
Favorite riff-Tom Servo:  That isn't freezer wrap, that's a hand  bag!",965347200,4,655,4.631578947368421

I love MST3K to the deepest depths of my soul but even I found it hard to get through this episode from the Comedy Central years (Season One)... Dr. Larry Erhardt (TV Frank's  predecessor) is annoying in the extreme and I wanted to fast-forward  through most of the host segments with him in it. Even Joel seems a little  lackluster in this one. Buy this ONLY if you are a die-hard fan of the show  and want to complete your collection or you are just very interested in the  early years of MST3K and have money to burn. Some of the riffs made me  laugh out loud... but there are startlingly few of them (even compared to  Comedy Central years: Season Two--when I started to watch the show). If you  are a first time viewer of MST3K or became a fan during the Sci-Fi years, I  would recommend Eegah, Skydivers or either Shorts 1 and 2 to start you off.",951523200,5,898,4.235294117647059
1010156,2,6305320470,"I am a huge fan of this series and was shocked at how appallingly bad this episode was. Despite some good knocks during the movie, this was a waste of $ which I could have spent on something else (perhaps ""Catalina Caper"" or ""Wild World of Batwoman""). Being a veteran fan of  the show, I read in the Episode Guide that the makers of the show wouldn't  release any of the early episodes because they weren't up to the standards  of their later work. How right they were. I should have listened to them,  but unfortunately due to my curiosity, I wasted my hard-earned money,  valuable time, and the makers of the show have irreversibly embarassed  themselves. Let's hope that they redeem themselves with some excellent  future video releases (a few more ""Shorts"" videos, please, hosted  by Tom or Crow or Gypsy?).",948240000,7,811,4.661971830985915

It's delight to see how things looked in the old days, particuly to anyone who bacame a fan from the SciFi channel episodes.

1010158,3,6305320470,"This classic MST3K episode is from season 1 (episode #106). If your new to MST3K then this isn't the video for you, but if your a huge MSTie, like me, then you'll enjoy seeing an early version of MST3K. Season 1 is way  differant than all of the other seasons. For one the riffs are lame, slow  and pointless. Second, The special effects and the sets are very low  budget, and bots are green when they're in the theater. Third, this episode  doesn't have Frank as Dr. Forrester's helper and Tom Servo has a differant  voice cause Josh ""J. Elvis"" Weinstein was still on the show. Even  though this episode isn't that funny it's still a great episode for the  true fan of MST3K. I thought it was a good effort for MST3K at it's time  since it was made in 1989, and they were just starting out so that's why I  gave it 3 stars. As Larry would say, Enjoy!",944006400,4,851,4.236024844720497
1010159,4,6305320470,This is a great video for any MST fan because it shows the origin of one of the best programs on TV.  The timing is not quite as strong as Joel's  later work and some of the jokes don't work quite as well.  Still it has  some wonderful moments and it is great to see the show in this embryonic  stage.  I would not recommend it as the first tape to purchase though.  It  is better appreciated as a rough draft of what would become a damn fine  show!!!,941414400,2,451,3.9775280898876404
1010160,4,6305320470,"I for one really loved all the hand jokes ('gotta hand it to him', 'born to hand-jive', 'hand-to-hand combat', 'the long arm of the law') not to mention the Skipper jokes ('not till the next boating accident', 'i'm going  on a three hour tour', 'can I call you little buddy?').

1010161,3,6305320470,"This is very different from the later episodes. The homade props and cheesy sets look good but things are very different. Dr. Larry Earheardt, not Tv's Frank is Dr. Forrester's assistent, Tom Servo has a strange voice,  and the jokes aren't very funny. However, there are some good jokes like  great timing (Hi, I'm Tom Servo, Ten seconds till he slaps table, I smell a  transformation scene). Tom's Fine Young Cannible jokes and how they ripp  into that mean old man who say's ""No dancing, not allowed"" (While  psychotic Paul is trying to kill him Joel and the bots say ""No  Zombies, not allowed."" and ""No Killing! Not allowed."" are  really funny too. Pretty funny, but in light of there wonderful work in  classics such as Manos and Mitchell, kinda dissapointing.

7887673,2,6305320470,"By that I mean the commentary, not the movie itself (which is beyond inept).  This should be seen by anyone who did not get to see Season One of MST3k, and should thus be viewed within a historical context and to satisfy your curiosity.  No wonder Jim Mallon refuses to let the KTMA and Season 1 eps see the light of day (except for ""Hand"").  If this is the best that they could muster for Season 1, then they could ONLY get better.  The writing was rough- lame jokes fell flat (how many times can Weinstein pitch ""He's smoking"" or something similiar), and the one legitimate laugh came from the Invention Exchange.  Joel was even more sleepy than in other episodes, and Trace hadn't quite busted out with Crow at that time in the show (he's pretty low-key).  I am an unabashed Kevin Murphy fan, and the show was that much better for his Tom Servo (this isn't an attempt to slag J. Elvis Weinstein, but- oh, OK it is).  Worth a rental, or if you can get it REALLY cheap.  Otherwise, a very rare dud in the MST3K 'chise.

7887674,4,6305320470,"The only reason why this is one of my favorites is because its so old. Plain and simple. It's great for the fan who just recently started to get into the show, and wants to know what it looked like ""back then"".",1047945600,2,210,4.023809523809524
7887675,4,6305320470,"Ah, MST3K Season One.  I can see how some people, even MST3K fans, might be disappointed by this video.  Instead of TV's Frank, Dr. Forrester has Dr. Larry Erhardt (John Weinstein) for a sidekick, and it is Weinstein rather than Kevin Murphy supplying the voice of Tom Servo.  The set looks as cheap as it really was, the silhouettes in the theater are sort of green-looking, Joel sometimes seems to forget which bot is which, and the jokes are sometimes rather lame.  However, the show is still hilarious.  If you've never seen a Season One episode before, cut Weinstein's Servo voice some slack.  Initially, I hated it, but being fortunate enough to have the whole first season on tape, I found that this initial Servo incarnation was actually pretty funny in his own right after I got used to him.  This one video probably won't make you a Weinstein fan, but give him a chance.
As for the movie itself, The Crawling Hand was perfect MST3K material--there's a silly plot, an annoying teenager, and some incredibly bad acting.  America's space program is apparently run in a little warehouse somewhere in the middle of nowhere, and the scientists there are in a tizzy.  On two occasions, a guy has been sent to the moon, landing successfully, then being lost on his way back to earth.  This second time, communication is reestablished with the astronaut 20 minutes after he has run out of oxygen.  He begs the men in the control room (actually, it's really just a desk) to blow him up before he reenters the atmosphere.  The doctor-type guy finally hits the red button.  Meanwhile, a supposedly smart slacker goes swimming in the ocean with his Swedish girlfriend, and while they are frolicking around they run across a human hand lying on the beach.  Naturally, our hero decides he must have that hand; he sneaks back that night (apparently this is the one beach in California that no one whatsoever goes to) and makes the wonderful hand his own, lovingly placing it in his landlady's storage room behind some relish.  Soon, the hand (which does crawl, just like the title says) begins strangling people (that's gonna happen, you know).  At this point, the sheriff, AKA Alan Hale (Skipper!), commences an investigation.  One print found on the body of the first victim is matched to the fingerprint of the blown-up astronaut, and that's when the Space Boys come out to try and clean up a little of their mess.  To complicate matters, our boy who found the hand begins having episodes wherein he turns into an ""Elvis zombie"" with heavy mascara under his eyes and feels compelled to strangle people himself.  As you may have guessed, it all comes down to some hand to hand combat in the end.
I think this is one of the best Season One episodes.  I particularly enjoyed one skit in which the guys all pretend to be William Shatner being choked by a disembodied hand.  Joel and the bots are still developing the real spirit and style of the show, but the genius is already unmistakably there.  Most importantly, I can assure you that this show is very funny.",1027814400,26,3056,4.694183864915572
7887676,2,6305320470,"This episode from Season One (the first season on Comedy Central, but the second actual season) isn't a very good watch. First off is the differences, this being the first season the set for the SOL is very different and much cheaper. Tom Servo's voice is done by Josh Weinstien who's voice for Tom is dramatically different from Kevin Murphy's. Frank is gone with the Dr. E who isn't half as funny. Also, the shadow-rama is green.
But if you put aside all the differences the episode is still bad. In season one, the riffing pace wasn't as fast as the seasons after, so there aren't that many jokes. Also, the jokes that they did say just weren't as funny. The movie is very boring and slow and the riffs just can't save it. The host segments also aren't very funny and just go nowhere really fast.
The bright points are that this IS MST3K, so it is still funny in some parts and also it's just an interesting glimpse of the first season.
Reccomended only IF you are a fan of the show who must have every episode.",1024704000,2,1014,4.37037037037037
7887677,5,6305320470,"For a long time, the Best Brains' resisted releasing Season One episodes, feeling that they had not yet perfected their art -- or, as they put it in the Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, 'they're not very good and we don't want them seen.' According to producer Jim Mallon, Season One is remembered as 'the awful time.'
But finally they relented, and gave us Show 106, 'The Crawling Hand.' And you know what? It's not great. The MSTie interested in the complete and utter history of the show will value this glimpse of the semi-legendary Dr Erhardt, Tom Servo's old voice, and the early versions of the set and opening credits. But if you're less familiar with the show, I would recommend starting someplace else, because it got a LOT better than this, and I wouldn't want you to be scared away by one early performance.
MST featured many villainous body parts and horrors-from-space in the early years. Come to think of it, they had a lot of horrors-from-space in the later years too. Cult TV aficionados will enjoy the sight of Alan Hale, Jr hamming it up in a horror flick",1006905600,16,1073,4.62303664921466
7887678,2,6305320470,"I've been a rabid MSTie ever since I accidentally caught an airing of ""Cave Dwellers"" on the Comedy Channel many many moons ago (and for those of you who remember the pre Comedy Central era, that should tell you just how many moons that is.)  While I can appreciate the fact that these guys were still in their experimental/formative stages at the time of this episode -- let's face it, they had just graduated from local access -- I still can't help but label this one as a dud.  MST3K was (is) a show with riffs and snags at the core, and when the rimshots are as slow-coming and uninspired as the ones featured in ""The Crawling Hand,"" the focus of the show shifts rather unhealthily to the actual film itself.  I barely managed a chuckle for the majority of the episode -- the fact that Servo (brought to ""life"" by Weinstein) sounds narcoleptic didn't help much either.  If it weren't for the Shatner-ripping in the bumpers and a few moments of life toward the end, I'd have laid a one-star review on this one.  Still, it is useful to have in a collection to show how far the cast had come by the time of such third season opuses as ""Cave Dwellers"" and ""Pod People.""  Also, it will make you appreciate Kevin Murphy, who took over Servo after Weinstein departed, pretty much on the same level as oxygen.",1006819200,5,1305,4.439330543933054
7887679,4,6305320470,"While I agree with many other reviewers -- this is not the funniest of the many MST3K episodes -- I must say it still has much merit.
An astronaut goes completely off his rocker and blows up his ship.  Soon after, a dorky med-school student named Paul finds the astronaut's severed hand on a beach while taking a romp with a foreign chick.  He takes the hand home(Tom: ""Thank goodness he brought a handbag!""), puts it on a pantry shelf (isn't that an odd place to keep body parts?), and the next thing he knows it's on the loose and in the mood to kill.  The sheriff (the skipper from Gilligan's Island), shows up on the scene, and his arrival marks the beginning of an endless stream of Gilligan jokes.
When watching this episode, one must take into consideration that this was a very early episode.  They still had some bugs to work out of the show -- it was still a work-in-progress, and it took many seasons before finally reaching the peak of funniness.
Even if it's just for the Def Leopard crack (visual: severed hand; audio: ""didn't you used to be with Def Leopard?""), anyone who likes MST3K should give this one a shot.",995241600,2,1128,4.461165048543689

Well, over a decade has passed since I saw this episode, and watching it recently I couldn't believe how primitive it seemed.  As mentioned in other reviews, there are long pauses in between riffs, Tom Servo's voice could induce sleep, and the deliveries are toneless and lack enthusiasm.
