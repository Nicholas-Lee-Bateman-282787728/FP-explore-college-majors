1234143,5,B00000JLWQ,"Over 20 yrs. has passed since I have seen this intense movie and I have not forgotten it. I vaguely remember the other 2 stories but this one sticks in my mind the most. A voodoo doll with a little knife terrorizis a  lady after accidently losing the chain on the doll. This movie has many  surprises and a very wierd and disturbing ending. This movie is a must see,  however, make sure you watch it with no expectations whatsoever and you  will enjoy it immensly (or at least find yourself having nightmares).",952646400,,510,4.451612903225806

1234159,4,B00000JLWQ,"Trilogy of Terror was written by one of the masters of horror fiction, Richard Matheson (author of ""The Legend of Hell House,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Amazing Shrinking Man,"" and countless short stories & Twilight Zone episodes). Although this is a made-for-TV movie, actress Karen Black is at the top of her game in bringing the script to life. Three separate horror stories made up the film, all starring Ms. Black. The final installment is worth the whole movie! It pits Karen Black against a murderous voodoo doll named ""He Who Kills."" The doll rampages and corners Black in her apartment. Truly an amazing script, brilliant acting and a first-class production, directed by Dan Curtis (creator of ""Dark Shadows"").

Funny, though, I don't recall the 1st 2 stories, well, maybe a little of the 1st.  The 1st 2 being predictable, I think these storylines have been used time and again.  This movie was a 1st back then.  Karen Black was very popular in the 70's.  I also saw the actual doll at Universal Studios years and years ago displayed in glass.  It was pretty cool!

1234169,1,B00000JLWQ,I'm surprised at all the rave reviews.  The first two stories are neither scary nor suspenseful and both rely on a lame twist ending for shock value.  The second story is the worst.  It would take a person with half a brain about thirty seconds to figure out that the two sisters were the same person.  The third story is decent but more for the comedy of it than any real scares.  It is pretty hilarious to see the fetish doll running after Karen Black with a knife all the while screaming like the Tasmanian Devil from Looney Tunes.,1493424000,,534,4.353535353535354

1234182,2,B00000JLWQ,"The third story is a thrill, at least compared to what came before it. Its about a Zuni fetish doll that comes to life and tries to kill a woman named Amelia. Shes played by Karen Black, who also stars in the other two stories, neither of which induce a single scare, let alone terror. The first, about a college student having a sexual relationship with his teacher, is sort of interesting until the stupid ending. The second one, which I do commend for being bold enough to include as a plot device a daughter sexually seducing her father; again with the sex; is stupid all the way.

Had she known, she most definitely would have turned it off and put me back to bed because this movie terrified me. I had nightmares of that doll for the longest time. In fact, I never owned a doll since that movie. Interestingly enough though, in my teens I became a huge horror film fan and always wondered what the name of this movie had been as I didn't actually know since the 3rd story was all I ever saw. I still thought of that doll from time to time.

1234199,4,B00000JLWQ,"Im just poking fun at the sounds the Zuni doll makes.

Released to TV in 1975, ""Trilogy of Terror"" features three stories by Richard Matheson, the only memorable one being the last, Amelia, which involves a creepy Zuni doll. All three stories star Karen Black:

1. Julia (25  minutes): PLOT: A sinister college stud seeks to manipulate a mousy English teacher whom he thinks is hot underneath her drab demeanor. EVALUATION: This ones not bad, but its nothing great either. GRADE: C+

2. ""Millicent and Therese"" (20 minutes): PLOT: Two sisters, one puritanical and the other satanic, are evaluated by a doctor. EVALUATION: This is the dullest and most predictable of the three, but its so short its over before you know it. GRADE: C-

3. Amelia (25 minutes): PLOT: A woman living in a high rise apartment brings home a Zuni doll that she bought for her boyfriend, an anthropology teacher (the Zuni People, by the way, are a Native American tribe, most hailing from the Pueblo of Zuni in western New Mexico). The doll comes with a scroll claiming that it contains the spirit of a Zuni warrior named ""He Who Kills and that the gold chain adorning the doll keeps the spirit trapped within. When the chain falls off horror ensues. EVALUATION: While I busted out laughing for several minutes when the doll initially goes on the rampage (more for personal reasons than because the films unintentionally humorous), this segment becomes legitimately harrowing and is quite creative, not to mention the F/X are effective for a TV movie from the mid-70s. The ending is memorable and Karen is outstanding. GRADE: A

1234208,5,B00000JLWQ,"In this 1975 TV movie for ABC, Dark Shadows creator Dan Curtis brings us three tales of terror by Richard Matheson, all starring Karen Black in completely separate roles. In the first story, Black is a frumpy college professor who is asked out by one of her students. They secretly attempt to start dating. Little does she know the student has sinister plans for her. In the second story, Black is a reserved, troubled woman being driven into an unhealthy mental state by her mean-spirited and totally uninhibited sister. Something must be done about the trouble-making sibling, and fast! In the third and final story in this anthology film, Black is a frustrated young woman with a demanding mother and a boyfriend who seems no better. She has just purchased a Zuni fetish doll for his birthday present, since he is an anthropologist. Unfortunately for her, the golden chain that keeps the little doll, ""He Who Kills"", from coming to life is about to fall off!

Despite a great first story, Trilogy of Terror might have been just another long forgotten television horror flick of the 70's were it not for the infamous ""Amelia"" segment, also known as ""Prey"", also known simply as ""He Who Kills"" or, ""The one about the little Zuni Fetish doll that chases the woman around with a knife inside her apartment!"" Yes, simple as that final story is, it is quite thrilling and has a stinger ending that will give you nightmares. I remember being really freaked out by seeing it playing on TV in Spanish when I was a small child, ha. Something about not being able to understand the dialogue made it extra scary, and you could still follow it just fine. It's a short story that, if you watch it once, you'll never forget it. The second story in the group is somewhat lackluster to me, maybe because I found it easy to predict, but that could be because I've seen that sort of twist a lot, it seems, and yet maybe it was a new plot device at the time. Overall though, with the excellent first and final stories, this one is definitely a keeper and fun to show to friends.

The DVD release nicely serves up a high quality presentation with three excellent bonus features. There are excellent interview featurettes, one on star Karen Black and another on writer Richard Matheson, and there's an audio commentary track with Karen Black and writer William F. Nolan, who adapted the first two stories in the film. This commentary is someone painful to listen to, as Black seems a bit difficult for Nolan to interact with throughout. Watch a bit and you'll understand what I mean.

Awesome DVD of an awesome horror classic. Pick this up for some good fun, especially if you are a fan of anthologies. I LOVE anthology horror, and this one is a must!",1442793600,,2732,4.628865979381444

Karen, having ""Airport '75"" also in the same year hits us with some good stories of teacher vs. student, two sisters that hate each other, and a fight for her life with a living zuni fetish doll that would make ""Chucky"" scream bloody murder. lol  I remembered watching this years ago and this DVD Special Edition is well done. It looks and sounds great and has some good special features. I believe this was made for TV as it is not widescreen format. Nevertheless, Dark Sky Films should be commended on this release. If you are a Karen Black fan, like I am, I think you owe it to yourself to get this or at least check it out. The stories are well written and Karen does a fantastic job bringing all of them to light. I like all of them. That doll, wow, I believe was the second ""murderous doll"" that had been ever filmed for a project. The first? I think it would be ""Talking Tina"" in the original Twilight Zone TV series by Rod Serling. The title is ""Living Doll"". Chucky and Annabelle would be the latest entries to this doll crazy theme.

There was a production fault with the DVD though.  The sound of the movie was not in sync during the last two stories.  The person on the screen would visually speak the words about 1-2 seconds after they are heard.  I could probably return it but I expect that any replacement DVD would also have the same flaw.

1234274,5,B00000JLWQ,"Starring Karen Black, this is a trilogy of terror tales written by Richard Matheson (I Am Legend) and William F. Nolan who wrote the screenplay for Burnt Offerings - everyone should see that one, it is one of my favorites from my childhood and it has Bette Davis in it.

 This is a fun little dvd. I was saving it for Halloween but that is a bit long to wait. It has a full length commentary with the late Ms. Black and William F. Nolan. It also has a documentary and interviews Richard Matheson and a documentary and interviews with Karen Black about her career... she was on Broadway and was in Easy Rider (although she tried to pretend like she wasn't even in it).

Ms. Black plays 4 different parts in three shortish (20-40 minutes) films. In one she is a college Lit teacher who turns the tables on a student trying to blackmail her. In the second she plays sisters, one good, one bad. And in the third she plays a haggard daughter who purchases a Zuni fetish doll for her boyfriend's birthday.

The performances are excellent. It is also fun to look into a window on the 1970's. The first story is okay, the second somewhat predictable and the third one is just crazy enough to be watchable.

So this would be the perfect dvd for an All Hallows' Eve. You might want to get Burnt Offerings, as well and make it a double feature because this is still not that long (79 minutes) even with the extras. Except the commentary of course, you have to watch it a second time for that.",1408838400,,1481,4.351449275362318

I convinced myself that the little jabbering, spear-wielding, piranha-toothed Zuni fetish demon was running down the hall, ready to kill me and my entire family. Decades later, I saw this and actually had the nerve to laugh at it but honestly I'll always be terrified of this thing.

1234285,3,B00000JLWQ,"I really like this cult tv film.  I was really excited to get a good, clear copy of it with the special features included, but one of the reasons I purchased it was to hear the commentary.  I found the exchange between Karen Black and William F. Nolan that runs through the first two segments to be rather tedious and boring.  They had about zero chemistry between them, and I thought Karen's recollections about this movie were understandably pretty hazy, leading me to wonder what the point really was.  I know that we fans of the movie really wanted to hear it and all, but it really turned out to be a disappointment to me.  Fortunately, I only paid $4.50 for it--the price vacillates between that price and about $15--so I wasn't out much.  I really would have hated to have spent the money on it otherwise.  Hope this helps someone...",1405123200,,840,4.52317880794702

1234361,5,B00000JLWQ,"Okay, the Zuni doll episode is a bit silly (to me at least), but I like all of these stories! They are really like watching episodes of ""Night Gallery"" or some of the old anthology thriller TV shows from the silver age. I think these offerings are among the better selections from Richard Matheson's short story library. And what a showcase for the amazing Karen Black! This is a fun show to watch, it's nostalgic and thrilling.
The special edition DVD is wondrous. The DVD includes an audio commentary with the thoughts of William F. Nolan, plus Ms. Black is also along for the reminiscence. There is also a short video interview with Richard Matheson in which he basically explains that no thriller film has ever reached the heights of the satirical ""Rosemary's Baby"" again (and I agree with him there, but that was mostly a case of ingenious marketing strategies). The picture is great, and the sound quality is good for a program from the mid-70s. Overall, this is a classic and a keeper.",1389225600,,992,4.674285714285714

1234363,4,B00000JLWQ,"During the 1970s, the TV Movie of the Week was a network staple at ABC, and a number of those films are well remembered today, including Trilogy of Terror, a horror anthology that showcased three talented artists, writer Richard Matheson, director Dan Curtis, and star Karen Black. Getting Black to star in a TV movie was quite a coup at the time, since she was one of the most in-demand big screen actresses of the day.

The film features dramatizations of three stories by Richard Matheson (although he didn't write the teleplay), each starring Black. Frankly, the first two stories are decent, but hardly memorable. However, I would venture that no one who has ever seen the last segment of the film will ever forget it. In fact, this role is the one Black said more people asked her about than any other film she made. The title is ""Amelia"" but most people remember it as the ""Devil Doll"" story. Black receives a birthday present of a six-inch Zuni fetish doll that soon comes to life, armed with a tiny but quite sharp spear, and spends the rest of the episode chasing and trying to kill Black.

There's a fine edge in movies like this between silliness and genuine suspense, but this one holds up quite well. The effects are fairly decent considering that this was a TV movie with 1970s FX puppet technology. It's genuinely creepy, with a couple of good gotcha moments as Curtis ratchets up the suspense, and Black plays the role absolutely straight.

The DVD has some nice bonus extras as well, including an audio commentary by Black. If all three episodes were the quality of the last one, this would have been one of the best TV movies of all time. As it is, it's still a nifty thrill ride that can be experienced in under ninety minutes (under 30 if you fast forward to the last episode).",1387411200,3,1798,4.560371517027864
1234364,5,B00000JLWQ,I remember the first time I saw this on TV and it really creeped me out.  Especially the movie with Kim Darby in the spooky house. Glad I got it on DVD.,1385942400,,152,3.75

1234366,4,B00000JLWQ,"Despite being made for tv, Trilogy of Terror has over the years gotten the reputation as one of the finest horror anthology films ever made, and imo it deserves all the acclaim it gets.
The film of course couldn't rely on gruesome gore effects to shock the audience, but instead had to use good ole fashioned good writing and suspense to win over it's audience. It has of course 3 stories.

Story 1
Julie
This one revolves around a horny college student who becomes more and more dangerous as his obsession with one of his proffesors grows.
What could've been your typical and cliched 70's style thriller short, ""Julie"" turns out to be anthing but! It may not have a ton of horror, but the story packs on quite the good twist ending that throws everything on it's head.

Story 2
Millicent and Therese
Vanilla story about a woman who plots to stop her sister who she believes is evil.
Not bad or anything, but it's definitly the weakest story here. Somewhat boring with quite the predictable twist. Karen Black is fantastic though, and I think she may've been the strongest in this story overrall.

Story 3
Amelia
A woman buys a Zuni fetish doll for her new boyfriend which soon terrorizes her in her apartment. Can she find some way to stop it?
""Amelia"" is the fan favorite, and is probably why the film is still remembered today. It's suspenseful and a perfect story to close with.

Karen Black is in all 3 stories, and the film is able to showcase what great range she had as an actress, and how underrated she really was.
Terrific film!",1385164800,,1539,4.525179856115108

Ms. Black, one of the first actresses in Hollywood to play strong independent women, not afraid to take risks. YOUR STAR WILL ALWAYS SHINE BRIGHTLY. Ms. Karen Black, one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood during the '70s, plays all the lead characters in this terrifying collection of 3 different stories that showcase her acting talent. JULIE, a murderous teacher, MILLICENT & THERESE, 2 disturbed sisters, AMELIA, by far the best segment in the trylogy for the vicious warrior doll that comes to life and terrorizes Ms. Black inside her apartment.

1234456,1,B00000JLWQ,"This is one of the all time horror classics that doesn't deserve to be. This is three tales of terror all staring Karen Black. All three are very dull and have a cast of what seems like 2 or 3 people. The first tale has Karen Black as a college teacher that goes out on a date with a student that ends up blackmailing her. Yep. That's the terror. 30 minutes of it. The second tale is about a doctor that makes house calls to two sisters.... both played by Karen Black. Both have murderous intensions against each other. Then finally the third tale of terror is the only one that will not bore you to tears. This tale involves a long phone conversation from Karen Black to her mother that you can't hear... followed by her struggle for survival with a murderous doll. Good stuff if you don't laugh at the premise.

Literally all three tales are Karen Black's acting with no help and it's not very good. When John Lithgow can be a man on a plane and make you believe that he sees a gremlin on the wing of the plane, that is acting. When Ryan Renolds can be in a box for 90 minutes, that is acting. Karen Black needed a lot of help to get these bad tales over. Help like actual terrifying things and not soap opera drama. Perhaps times were simpler when these tales were made in the 70s.

I'm sure you can go to a 5 year old and ask them what scares them and they'll come up with something more frightening than this.",1335312000,4,1414,4.194852941176471

So...I had my kids (then 9 and 12) invite a few friends over for a sleepover. I fattened them up with pizza and soda, and then we all sat down for some good old fashioned horror. I'll tell you...after ""Amelia"" was over with, every child (yes, even the 12 year olds) wanted to watch Tom and Jerry, just to be able to go to sleep later on.

1234463,4,B00000JLWQ,"This is a great little made for TV horror film from the 1970's. It ranks right up there with other made for TV movies like ""The Night Stalker"" starring Darin McGavin and ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark"" starring Kim Darby as among the best. As the title suggests this is three short stories of terror in one made for TV movie. Karen Black is the star of the movie and appears in all three stories. The first two stories are good though nothing really great. Good suspense to the stories but nothing that will make you jump out of your skin but will still hold your attention. The third story however is where all the horror is located. That one will make you want to keep the lights on at night and jump at the slightest sound you hear. It is the one with the Zuni warrior doll that comes to life and is blood thirsty to kill.  All I will say about the Zuni doll that appears in the third segment is that it makes Chucky (from ""Child's Play"" movies) look like a wimp.

Karen Black does an excellent job acting in all three segments. She seemed like the perfect choice to star in this movie. Karen Black I always thought was a great actress who was a bit underrated by many despite appearing in some great films, ""Five Easy Pieces"", ""Easy Rider"" and ""Nashville"" among others. The writing also helps to make this an enjoyable film to watch thanks to co-writers Richard Matheson (one of the best sci-fi writers of all time) and William F. Nolan.

This is a film I can recommend to anyone. For those my age this will be a nice nostalgic movie from the past. For those who have not seen this or may not of even heard of ""Trilogy Of Terror"" before but are horror fans will enjoy this little made for TV movie. It is good fun and even the whole family can sit down together and watch though if you have very young children you might want to skip having them see the third story.

1234485,4,B00000JLWQ,"This movie is like a trio of old ""Twilight Zone"" episodes ('70s style) strung together starring the incomparable Karen Black.

The episodes are simply named after the female protagonists in each: ""Julia"", ""Margaret & Therese"" and ""Amelia"". Interestingly, the supporting players become progressively less important in each segment. She stars with her then-current husband in the first one (which features a young Gregory Harrison in a bit part); does the Patty Duke trick by playing dual roles in the second one and is the lone actor in the finale.

Ms. Black shows her range here, as the roles require her to essay an uptight, frigid schoolteacher who may not be all she seems; a mutually-loathing pair of twins consisting of a tarty, carefree blonde and her bifocal-wearing, brittle chapped-lipped spinster sibling; and a young woman trying to deal with an overbearing mother who's life is changed by purchase of a creepy little ancient warrior doll.

Ms. Black herself has stated she does not consider these true horror movies and I would agree they fall more into the psychological thriller category, more along the lines of something like ""The Stepford Wives"".

Very entertaining for those who love '70s films, this one falls somewhere in between A-list and Grindhouse as it's not quite either.

1234487,5,B00000JLWQ,"For folks who remember the doll from their days as a kid, you ""get it.""  If you have no memory of this Zuni doll, you did not see it.  And if you did and still don't remember it, there are 2 possibilities:

1.  You had no cognitive ability at that time and thus, just didn't notice it (maybe you were too young or too busy playing with Matchbox cars).
2.  You were simply in shock and subsequently, have no memory of it.  (The human mind has a way of preserving itself, so I'm told.)

This show has 3 decent tales, and the first 2 are entertaining enough for adults.  As a kid, I don't remember them and as an ""adult,"" they are just fine and a good watch for a weekday.  Years ago, movies were made for folks with patience and appreciation for imagination.  Just take a look and you will enjoy them.  And I am convinced the first 2 were made to lull the young kids into staying in the room not expecting to be scared silly.

The FINAL story is what haunted me for years.  There's no need to explain the details as they have been covered and besides, they are too frightening and painful.  There's a chain, and a bathtub, and a spear, and a knife, and teeth, and......  STOP!!!!!

In college, I worked in a records/records/video store chain and innocently enough.  That is, until one day I found this video on the shelf and there it was; that Zuni Doll on the cover!  Instantly, I remembered it and all the horrible memories.  And I had NO option other than to take it home to watch it, AGAIN.  And of course, at night with all the lights out; and alone.  Yes, all those same fears, shocks, etc., instantly returned.

20 years after that college experience, I was reminded of it again and confided in my lovely and caring bride the sheer terror this show induced.  Of course, I NEEDED to share those feelings and direct experiences with her.  Hastily, I ordered it and like a Good Woman, she agreed to sample it.  Imagine the renewed terror and new shame as you feel all those feelings again with the love of your life as she looks on in disbelief and laughs?!?!?!

Challenge your fears and overcome them by watching this again!  And if you have not seen it as a kid, please understand that some of us have and one day may find the courage to face that damned Zuni doll and do what Karen did to it in our minds!",1315180800,,2310,4.274826789838337

1234507,5,B00000JLWQ,"This movie dated 1975 was produced and directed by legendary Dan Curtis and like  his earlier series ""Dark Shadows"" there are several unintentional funny moments. Richard Matheson was co-writer of the stories and wrote several great episodes of ""Ghost Story,"" which is the first time I laughed at Karen Black in the episode ""Bad Connection."" Please read my review on this. There are 3 short stories, which starred Ms. Black. The first one ""Julie"" about a wallflower college professor who gets blackmailed by one of her students. It is funny to see Karen in a drab role. Then, she plays two sisters in ""Millicent and Therese,"" one is again a drab sister and the other is a boxum blonde sister. The boxum blonde portrayal is what makes you laugh and how the drab sister sister complains about her is funny. When you think you have seen Karen Black at her campy best, you are in a really nice treat in ""Amelia."" This is about a woman controlled by her mother, who buys a Zuni fetish doll. Ha, ha, the doll comes to life and starts attacking Karen. Instead of being scared even with blood being seen, I couldn't stop laughing. This episode is so crazy and unintentionally funny. Famous line from Karen Black, ""I can't believe this is happening to me."" Please buy this dvd and invite some friends, who love to laugh. The last episode alone is worth buying. There is a surprise ending but watching Ms. Black interact with the doll is so funny, who cares about an ending. Ms. Black I love you and will be looking for more of your funny movies.

1234508,5,B00000JLWQ,"I, like so many other reviewers, first saw this as a kid in the 70s on late night TV, and it likewise scared the living hell out of me.

The first two stories, admittedly, didn't stand out in my memory from that time...but upon rewatching, I find them both to be entertaining and creepy in their own way, but more of dark ""Twilight Zone"" stories than ""terror"" tales. They do show the versatility of Karen Black, and that versatility carries over to the last chapter.

The third installment, ""Amelia"", is what got me then and still gets me now. I'm not going into lurid detail (that's already been done on these pages), but suffice to say that while the visual effects from this little short are showing their age (although I still find them effective), it's the SOUND: both from my childhood memory and watching it now, that provokes the sleeplessness and the nightmares when sleep finally comes. It struck me as funny how that sound brought all that terror from my youth back to me.

My daughter enjoyed this DVD with me, and whereas she suffers from being jaded by modern entertainment and finds classic movies that chilled me like ""The Entity"" rather dull, THIS one actually had her fidgiting and visibly uncomfortable.

It's over-acted at times but it really does work and has a Twilight Zone Tales From the Darkside kind of feel.

The scenes only showed Karen and the doll, but I felt like I was on a roller coster of a ride throughout.  Talk about a turn of event movie, the young man who thought he was blackmailing Karen, his college teacher, found out too late that she was actually in control and using him and the others as her unsuspecting victims.

1234531,4,B00000JLWQ,"Dan Curtis, brain child behind such 70's telehorror hits as ""Night Stalker,"" ""The Norliss Tapes,"" and ""Dark Shadows,"" scores another success with ""Trilogy of Terror.""  This anthology showcased Karen Black's versatility as a superb actress.  She portrays four different women in three tales of terror.  These women range from plain and conservative to wild and sensuous.  The three tales are all based on short stories written by Richard Matheson, the best-selling author of I Am Legend, which spawned three theatrical versions; the last one starred Will Smith.

  Supernatural deception is the theme in ""Julie.""  A handsome, young college student decides to blackmail his English professor, Julie, into dating him.  Naturally, there are deadly consequences.  This tale has a nice downbeat ending that is rather shocking.

  Identical twins hate each other in ""Millicent and Therese.""  Initially, it appears that one twin is good and the other is evil.  However, when the good one begins plotting to kill her sister, it becomes obvious that both are evil.  The ending was very predictable; I saw it a mile away.  This is my least favorite tale.

  ""Amelia"" is emotionally abused.  She can't date a man on his birthday without feeling guilty about cancelling an evening with her overbearing mom even though they see each other three times a week.  She buys a Zuni fetish doll as a gift for her boyfriend.  When the chain around its body falls off, the spirit inhabiting the doll is freed.  The doll comes to life and is relentless in attacking poor Amelia.  This was the best of the three stories and clearly influenced future horror films such as ""Stephen King's Cat`s Eye,"" ""Chucky,"" and ""Tales from the Hood.""

  Karen Black (Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 Corpses"") gave excellent performances in all three stories; it isn't surprising why Dan Curtis requested her to be a part of his next theatrical film ""Burnt Offerings"" - a film centered around a secluded country manor that demands human sacrifices in order to be rejuvenated.  It was nice to see former stars of ""Dark Shadows"" such as John Karlen and James Storm.  Look for Gregory Harrison in a cameo appearance.

  ""Trilogy of Terror"" is a must see for fans of Dan Curtis.  Also, if you enjoy horror anthologies from the 70's such as ""The House That Dripped Blood,"" ""Torture Garden,"" and ""Asylum,"" then you must see this one.

The second story contains a surprise as well, and even though it's something you might see coming, it's still a treat to watch Black sink her teeth into the performance.

1234541,4,B00000JLWQ,"If you don't know what a Zuni fetish is, you obviously have not yet viewed Dan Curtis's ""Trilogy of Terror."" Curtis had a long history with gothic and horrific storytelling on the small screen. In 1975, he filmed this television movie, which still resonates with people who saw it more than 30 years ago as children. Like many of the horror films presented on television in the 70's (""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"" comes to mind), ""Trilogy of Terror"" delivers suspense and subtle bits of violence that never becomes too bloody. The terror in this trilogy really occurs in the third story, all of which star Karen Black (Burnt Offerings, Invaders from Mars). Karen's solo fight against a Zuni warrior doll predates anything ""chucky"" accomplished. The idea of a spirit invading a doll is nothing new, but Curtis's treatment is enormously entertaining because of the doll's relentlessness. Also, I must say, I found myself laughing outloud during most of the assault--perhaps a bit of dark humor has invaded my own spirit. Regardless of whether you have a similar reaction, you'll most likely never forget our Zuni friend sawing his way out of a suitcase with a steak knife. And poor Amelia, (Black's character) trying to grab the jutting blade with her fingertips is enough to make you want to throw something at the screen--when you stop laughing, that is. The other two stories in this trilogy are somewhat engaging, but I think you'll agree that the Zuni fetish is a fitting finish to this fun flick.",1198627200,,1500,4.840466926070039

The short ""Julie"" really shows the acting range that Karen Black was capable of. ""Milicent and Therese"" was the weakest of the 3.

Nolan (Logan's Run).  The Zuni fetish doll no doubt caused more nightmares for children and adults than any other horror icon of the seventies.  If you haven't seen this movie, buy it now.

The remake is similar but I don't recall if all 3 stories are the sequels to the ones on the original DVD (since I only cared about my favorite movie, which happens to be depicted on the cover).

1234586,4,B00000JLWQ,"This dvd is a blastfrom the past from the late Dan Curtis, who also brought us 'Dark Shadows'.

The movie stars Karen Black, imho, an underrated actress.  She is in a three stories as different characters.  The most famous being Amelia who is hunted by the Zuni Doll.

The commentaries are well done, my one complaint though was that it was hard to hear sometimes, it was almost like they were being whispered.",1167782400,,410,4.575342465753424
1234587,5,B00000JLWQ,"Back in the heyday of Dark Shadows Dan Curtis did some telly movies.  Frankenstein with Robert Foxworth, The Norliss Tapes with Roy Thinnes, The Night Stalker with Darren Mcgavin, Scream of the Wolf with Clint Walker and Peter Graves, then eventually went on to do bigger projects like The Winds of War and War and Remembrance with Robert Mitchum.  During that salad days of the mid 1970s, he did a nifty ""novella"" style movie called Trilogy of Terror with Karen Black.  He went on to use Black in Burnt Offerings the following year.

It's a three story showcase, displaying the varied talents of Black, but it's in the last one where Curtis breaks out and really does something memorable.

The first novella tale is ""Julie"".  This tell was never fully fleshed out about a college professor who has dark secrets.  Nice quirky ending keeps this one for being average.

The second is ""Millicent and Therese"".  After the promise of ""Julie"", I really expected a bit more from this rather obvious tale.  Is good fun, just nothing special.  Still a fine showcase for Black to show what she can do.  It was just so all totally out there, no twist of the screw to make it more.

""Amelia"" The final one is based on Richard Matheson's Prey, and it outstanding.  Once you see these story you will never forget the Zuni warrior that comes to life.  Amelia is totally abused by her possessive and controlling mother.  She tries to break these ties that bind, but she is no match.  She buys a Zuni doll and it comes to life.  No spoiler there.  You can see that by the cover.  It's the story that is amazing.  Black's ending is original and memorable.

This was low budget telly movie remember, so accept the quality  as not motion picture level.

Still a GREAT Halloween movie and tribute to Curtis who died March '' this year.",1158969600,11,1814,4.579439252336448

A classic made-for-TV horror anthology from the writer of ""The Twilight Zone"" Richard Matheson and the creator of ""Dark Shadows"" Dan Curtis combines three original tales of terror with superb performances by Ms. Black to make an all-time horror classic of the 70's. Each has a stylish twist at the end of all three stories and the real star of the show besides Ms. Black is the famed African Zuni Fetish doll which is still the king of all killer dolls so move over Chucky or Blade from ""Puppet Master"".

1234589,5,B00000JLWQ,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE NEW 2006 SPECIAL EDITION VERSION.  WORTH BUYING.  I LOVE IT.  When I first saw this on TV in the 1970's it scared me half to death.  Karen Black stars in 3 short stories.  But as many reviewers here have posted, the most famous is the final story called Amelia about a woman who buys a doll for a boyfriend which comes to life and chases her around her apartment like a rabid animal.  In my opinion it is the third story that has caused Trilogy of Terror to be remembered after all these years.  The third story is a classic among terror films. In 1999 another company (Anchor Bay) released this on DVD but after they sold out their batch I don't think they released anymore.  That is why if you find someone selling it on Amazon or elsewhere you can expect to pay up to $500 for it.  I bought one at a Horror Movie convention and it turned up being a bootleg and when I took it home it didn't play.  I lost my money.  Finally it is out again.  This time by a different company and I am impressed with this version.  The film has been completely restored and is crystal clear like you are watching it back when it was first released.  I was highly impressed with the visual restoration. Exceeded my expecations here.  The interviews with Karen Black and writer Matheson are great and informative.  Karen looks great for her age and, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated actresses.  Just a joy to watch.  I haven't yet watched the entire disc from start to finish.  Truthfully, I got if for the third story only and if that was all the disc had I still would of bought it.  Not to say the first two stories aren't bad.  They are actually pretty good.  But if you asked a 100 people why they like Trilogy of Terror...they will likely mention the third story about the Doll.  The idea of a doll that comes to life and tries to kill is not new anymore and has been done repeatedly ever since.  Think Chucky.  But Trilogy of Terror I believe was the first to come out with it and what makes it work is that the doll is creepy looking.  Another reason this was so successful at the time is the novelty of it all.  Back when it first aired in the 1970's horror stuff, for the most part, was less gory.  The story about the doll is only 20 minutes long but what they do in those 20 minutes is amazing.  If you have never seen it before you likely will laugh since the special effects look a little cheesy now. They don't hold up well.  In my opinion...nothing beats the magic of seeing it back then and also seeing it for the first time.  Now that I watch it I know what happens throughout the whole story.  But if you haven't watched it before and you can watch it for the story and not try to compare it to special effects of today...you will likely appreciate it.  The acting of Karen Black alone is worth watching.  She makes all 3 stories work.  She makes them memorable.  I would of bought this if it had the third segment only and if it had no bonus material. On a side note...they came out a couple of years ago with a replica of the doll.  I was lucky enough to get a limited edition one of only 500 made.  The limited edition had a green outfit on.  Not what it wears in the movie.  They then sold a massed produced one with a brown outfit.  But it seems that everywhere you look everyplace is sold out of this doll.  I gave this five stars for those buying this that are collectors or who watched it back in the 1970's and want to see it again restored in all its glory.  If you are buying it now to see for the first time you will likely laugh more than being scared and will be disappointed wondering what all the fuss is about.  Buy it with an open mind and get lost in the story and you will not be disappointed.",1157587200,66,3751,4.164345403899722

For 30 years I remembered the Zuni fetish doll in the AMELIA segment, unable to recall much about the first two stories. Well, I just watched TOT again tonight, and I liked all three tales. While AMELIA is still my favorite, I found both JULIE and MILLICENT AND THERESE to be creepy and fun. Karen Black is a chameleon, changing from stuffy college professor- to evil murderess- to prim and proper prude to seductress, then terrified victim, and finally into savage huntress, all in under 80 minutes! Dan Curtis (Night Stalker, Night Strangler) allows Ms. Black to  show off her talent for making the strangest material seem believable, while letting her carry the whole thing almost single-handed!

1234592,4,B00000JLWQ,"I think I've enjoyed reading the other reviews just as much as waiting for Tuesday when this made for tv movie is finally released via wide/affordable distribution!  I so relate to the other viewers here who saw this movie when they were younger. I remember the first two tales in this movie were ok, Karen Black is one of the great consumate actresses of the 70's I feel in the horror/disaster genre.  She performed her three roles here with absolute freedom to do what she does best, but really shines in the last tale which I KNOW for most of you stands out the most.

My first experience seeing the third tale of Karen portraying a young woman terrorized by an Indian doll whose evil spirit was accidentally set loose being one of sheer terror. Hey all, remember the scene where she traps the doll in the suitcase and we see the knife coming up through it, cutting a hole open?  I could absolutely not move from that couch, neither could my sister.  We were genuinely frightened. I also remember reading later in the TV guide about the making of the third tale and of how the simple concept of rollerskates gave the picture of the doll running around the apt. constantly terrorizing Karen's character. No high digital effects-rollerskates!  Simplicity sometimes brings the best results, modern day movie people!

I look forward to adding this to my 70's tv DVD collection and will enjoy. Also, bet many of you didn't have color tv when you first saw it.  For those of you who can relate and haven't caught this flick on tv for ages like me,  we are going to enjoy!!",1156636800,7,1569,4.555160142348755

Then, it started all over again! And as if that was not enough hey I had to get up to go back to the daycare around (4:30sh 5am)so I could go back to sleep before school.

I don't remember any of the other stories (a Tales from the Crypt type movie)except for the one where this voodoo doll comes to life and terrorizes this lady with a spear or kitchen knife, take ya pick.

1234612,4,B00000JLWQ,"Alas, I was just a wee lad when ""Trilogy of Terror"" played on television back in 1975. I don't think my parents would have let me up stay up watch it anyway, as they would have deemed the word ""terror"" in the title as potentially damaging to my young psyche. Lots of people did watch this Dan Curtis production starring horror mainstay Karen Black, and they still seem to remember the third entry in the trilogy. Well, when I got old enough to watch lots of horror movies without worrying about my frail psyche, I kept hearing comments about this television program. When the DVD revolution opened fire a few years ago, I knew it was only a matter of time before I would finally sit down and see what so many people feared. I'm a Karen Black fan from a long time back, too, so watching this one falls under ""required viewing."" I have to say that for the most part, ""Trilogy of Terror"" is a trilogy of abject dullness. Black plays the lead in all three stories, stories culled from the mighty Richard Matheson catalogue, and only one delivers anything in the way of real shocks. But those shocks will stay with you long after the program ends.

I'll just lump the first two stories together in this paragraph since neither one really stands out. In the first tale, called ""Julie,"" Black plays the titular character, a dowdy looking college literature professor. One day Julie stumbles across campus on her way to work when one of her students, the studly Chad (Robert Burton), notices her and makes a suggestive comment to his pal Eddie (James Storm). Eddie is aghast that anyone he knows could find such a dour older woman attractive, but Chad's comment soon turns into an obsession. He must simply find out whether he can get a date with her, which he soon does. Chad does something quite despicable that evening, but he'll soon find out that tables can turn with deadly consequences. The second story, ""Millicent and Therese,"" sees Black doing double duty in a tale about two sisters. One of the sisters is uptight and ugly, while the other is a vivacious firecracker accustomed to hitting on the guys. The twist here, to cut to the chase, is that everything isn't as it seems. When one of the sisters dies in an upstairs bedroom, we find out the real truth about these two siblings thanks to their physician. It's your typical twist ending that isn't all that surprising, actually. Be sure and look for George Gaynes as the doctor and a young Gregory Harrison as one of Julia's students.

Now we can talk about ""Amelia,"" the final entry in the trilogy. Amelia lives alone in a high-rise apartment building in the city. She's a lonely woman due to the influence of her overbearing mother, but she's finally landed herself a boyfriend that she wants to see this very night. Her mother, who doesn't live with her by the way, doesn't like the idea of her daughter going out on a night when the two usually spend time together. Amelia whines about it being her boyfriend's birthday, tells her mother about the little Zuni fetish doll she bought for him, and the conversation ends in an impasse that insures Amelia feels guilty enough to postpone her date. Unfortunately for Amelia, a necklace hanging around the doll's neck--which supposedly keeps the spirit within safely bottled up--falls off when she puts the fetish down on the coffee table. Sure enough, the little doll comes to life and systematically stalks Amelia throughout the apartment. Screaming in terror for her life and becoming increasingly bloodied in the confrontations with the doll, Amelia thinks throwing the fetish in the oven will finally do the little monster in. The final scene of ""Amelia"" is definitely one of the creepiest shots in horror history, and it stays with you. That smile alone makes the DVD worth watching.

The biggest drawback to this television movie centers on its television production values and the writing. There really isn't anything we can do about that first problem--television almost always looks like television, and you just have to learn to live with the restrictions inherent in that medium. Fortunately, the stories work around a limited budget relatively well. Black's performances also help; she assumes a wide range of personas in the three stories and pulls them off with panache. She shrieks as well if not better than many of the big screen scream queens. I guess the writing difficulties, or I should say the screenplay adaptations of Matheson's stories, apply to the first two stories. I'm not surprised at all to learn that someone named William Nolan wrote ""Julia"" and ""Millicent and Therese."" He doesn't adapt the material well. I remember reading the ""Julia"" story in a Matheson collection, and in story form it worked. Here, it just comes off as confusing. The one piece of the trilogy that succeeds like gangbusters, ""Amelia,"" is the only one Matheson himself adapted for Curtis's production. Note to future filmmakers: always try to involve the original author in the screenplay. It almost always works better that way.

I'm still going to give ""Trilogy of Terror"" a good review, though. Black's performances even in the lesser pieces are good to great, and ""Amelia"" alone is worth adding a star to the overall rating. Let's give a big round of applause to Anchor Bay for releasing this to DVD. The picture quality looks good for a '70s television program, and there's even a short text interview with Black included as an extra on the disc. Dan Curtis had great success with his ""Night Stalker"" films and the ""Dark Shadows"" television series, but it's likely he'll best be remembered for this program. By all means check it out if you get the chance.",1121040000,2,5671,4.777777777777778

1234614,4,B00000JLWQ,"Like many of the other reviewers, I saw this movie at an impressionable young age and found it to be quite frightening.  The movie actually consists of three short films, each one starring Karen Black.  In the first, she plays a college professor who is being blackmailed by a student; you feel her pain and then surprise as the situation shifts.  In the second story, Black plays twins with opposite personalities, and she does a fine job in both roles.  Again, the plot contains a Twilight Zone-like, unexpected twist in the end.  Finally, in probably the most famous of the three tales, Black plays a woman who receives a statue of a small Zuni warrior as a gift.  In what may have been a foreshadowing for the Gremlins movie that would follow (""don't get them wet!""), the statute includes specific instructions not to remove the chain which encircles the doll's waist.  Of course, the chain--which obviously has not been secured very well--falls, the evil spirit inside the warrior comes to life, and Black is terrorized within her apartment.  I admit, not only was I extremely frightened by this, but I tortured my little sister with fears of ""the little guy under the bed"" for years!  If watching this movie today, I'm sure it would come across as both campy and goofy, but if you're looking for good, nostalgic, suspenseful horror, you can't go wrong here.",1116374400,,1363,4.76595744680851

All three stories, with Karen Black leading in each of them, are highly suspenseful and well-written and directed. From ""JULIE"", with Black as a conservative school teacher with a dark side, ""MILLICENT AND THERESE"" with Black as twin sisters with largely different personalities, and ""AMELIA"" as a single lady spending a night alone in her apartment with everyone's worst nightmare, this movie has become increasingly hard-to-find and is definitely worth the purchase if you do come across it.

When we were kids and saw the movie for the first time, our mom and dad went out for a few hrs and I was babysitting my two younger brothers.  After seeing the movie my brothers and I were scared and I'd run up and down the stairs away from them and they'd run after me thinking the voodoo doll was after them.  At one point the three of us even jumped up on the kitchen table to escape a possible voodoo doll chasing us.  Later, I hid around the corner of a hallway in the dark and threw a teddy bear at my brother who was coming out of the bathroom while my youngest brother David waited crouching in the hallway under a blanket waiting to jump up and scare our brother Johnny and needless to say, Johnny ran screaming and crying down the stairs.

1234619,4,B00000JLWQ,"Trilogy of Terror was a made for TV movie way back in the 1970's, when there was no such thing as cable television. For those of us who were kids back then, we had maybe five or six choices on television.

From other reviews of this film, there were lots of us who were glued to the television for this ""teleplay"" starring Karen Black.  It must have had some great promotion commercials...either that or we just didn't have anything else to do.

Designed as a trilogy, the film's first two stories are tedious bits of regurgitated storytelling.  I won't bother reviewing them. It is the third and final story - Amelia - that is frightening as it can be - at least to a child (now remember, we didn't have all these gory and scary movies available to us - the VCR wouldn't be produced for several more years) that broke ground not ever covered before.  It was the third story that scared me to death!

When you watch this film - and you really should watch all three stories, if for no other reason than to see how they originally played out - do so remembering how the world was when it was originally made.  We were a bit more innocent and we didn't have all the special effects available to us.  There was no Showtime or HBO and there certainly was no internet.

Of course, the TV version was tamed down a bit due to nudity in the first story between the high school ... boy, Chad, who finds Karen Black's MUCHO OLDER teacher character sexy in that sort of ""motherly/librarian"" way.  He drugs her, blackmails her with seedy pictures and thus the one sided affair ensues.  As if you can really tame down the GREAT and MAGNIFICENT Karen Black.

My sister and I saw this film back in the early 80s and it scared the living crap out of me. I couldn't sleep for maybe 2 weeks straight after watching it. I kept thinking that damn doll was underneath my bed or opening my door. Every little noise that I heard in my room I thought was that bastard walking around my bed. UGH I never wanna go through that again! I used to hate taking baths cause of that scene where she tries to drown it in the tub and it pops it's ugly head out of the water. To this very day, I see a green old suitcase and I think of her trying to capture it in there. What I don't get is WHY on earth would she even buy such a hideous looking thing in the first place! I'd never bring such an evil looking thing like that into my living room and I would have tossed it outside the window the second I got my hands on it. The damn doll is scary enough just looking at it, when you add him running around like a maniac with that knife and making that horrible screaming sound well it's just a zillion times worse. I am 27 years old now and I have seen this movie since I was a child and I STILL find it very frightening. I try to laugh at how ridiculous the whole thing is but I can't get over my fear of it. To this day I won't watch it, I saw it on DVD the other day in a store and I nearly freaked just seeing the cover. I hope the people that made this movie know how many children and adults it has terrified over the years. Karen Black is once scary chick! She will always remind me of that movie and therefore I can never watch one of her movies again lol. We should start a Trilogy of Terror therapy group!! lol

***EDITED FOR NEW SPECIAL EDITION DVD***

I was thrilled to hear Dark Sky Films was re-releasing this tv movie on DVD. It had been very hard to find the original Anchor Bay version anywhere. Plus this one is loaded with special features! I love the commentary and featurettes. Karen Black still looks good after 30 years and I loved hearing her talk about the difficulties of working with the doll. The picture quality looks fabulous too, almost as if it were airing originally for the first time. The special effects may be cheesy and fake but it still packs a punch when it comes to it's creepiness. Using mostly stop motion animation and fast editing, the Zuni doll seems to come alive and run around like a maniac. It's still creepy no matter how ridiculously fake it looks. What makes this doll so evil compared to Chucky and other imitations is the way it looks. It's demonic looking even when it's just still in the box. It looks evil and angry and ready to kill. It cannot be reasoned with and it has a relentless pursuit to kill poor Karen Black. For me that is what makes it truly terrifying. Plus it's so damn fast! Those eery sounds it makes as it's running around with the knife are still frightening to hear, most especially towards the end when it's in the oven. Oh and that ending is still scary to watch even though you know it's coming! It's a 30 minute segment that has influenced and terrorized people for over 30 years and for that it should be commended. I'm sure they had no idea they would still be talking about it to this day. I have yet to watch the first two stories, but I'm sure they will never be as creepy as ""Amelia"".

I gave this film four stars, only because of the third segment. The first two parts were really boring and were not scary and terror-filled as we would've expected from the gothic title.

1234631,4,B00000JLWQ,"Why anyone would consider Trilogy of Terror 'scary' is beyond me. If anything, the film should be looked upon as a light, hilarious comedy, especially with its final segment. It's these last thirty minutes that make the film so worthwhile.
The first two stories in the anthology are slow, but certainly interesting. The plot twists are obvious in a good way, and the wonderful Karen Black is superb as always.
However, it is the infamous Zuni doll from the segment titled ""Amelia"" that makes the film so special and puts it in the made-for-TV hall of fame. While most certainly intimidating and freaky, the doll is no doubt hilarious as he chases a screaming Ms. Black around her apartment with a butcher knife more than twice his size. This manages to produce chills as well as belly laughs gallore. It's a must for every horror fan, a chilling experience that manages to frighten, entertain, and make you laugh. Few made-for-TV genre films have had the same impact and none have managed to gain the cult status of ""Trilogy of Terror.""
A wonderful cast, brooding atmosphere, and that little Zuni make it far superior in quality to almost any TV horror film. The film as a whole is good, but the Zuni storyline is what manages to stick in people's head. It's the icing on top of the cake--the best part of a larger whole.

 All three stories star Karen Black in four different roles. The first story is titled, ""Julie"". This story is only 25 minutes long. A student has naughty thoughts about his teacher. He has leered at her sitting on the desk and has committed voueyerism by watching her though the window of her home. The teacher never goes out anymore. She prefers to stay home. One day, the student asks her to go to the drive-in with him. She does to watch the scary movie. He offers to get some refreshments. When he does, he spikes her drink. You'll have to watch the rest to find out what happens. Gregory Harrison has a small part.
 Story #2 is titled, ""Millicent And Therese"". This story is 20 minutes long. A spinster woman believes her sister killed mother and is guided by Satan. This is the story she tells her sister's boyfriend, played by John Karlin (original Dark Shadows, ABC serial),but he does not believe one word of it. What more will this woman say or do to get people to pay attention to what she says her sister is and does? She continues to write further in her diary.
 Story #3 is titled, ""Amelia"". This story is 17 minutes long. This is the story we all remember in the tv commercials and we were so horrified to watch it. It was suspensful. Now that we are more mature, we would probably laugh at it. This one too stars Karen Black. A woman brings home a strange African Fetish Doll holding a sharp spear. The doll has a spirit that makes it come to life. If the chain around his ribs should break, he will come to life. Well, it does. Now in her bathrobe just before she takes a bath, she notices the doll is not on the table, she finds it under the couch, but is stabbed. She hears it running around, but she can not find it again. The lights go out. Again she is attacked. The doll is fast and she can't get away from it. She tries to hide, but the doll is swift and finds her to kill her. How will this ever end?

1234633,5,B00000JLWQ,"Originally made for TV, ""Trilogy"" works just fine on DVD. Dan Curtis was a prolific TV director who presented many horror outings on television in the 70's but this is my favorite. The marvelous Karen Black was the perfect choice for these three tales of three very different women. In the first, she's a prim college professor who's really a witch/succubus with a taste for turning the tables on amorous young men. The second has her as a spinster with a split personality---allowing her to play ""two"" roles. And the last is the now famous Zuni fetish doll story that has the doll coming to life and terrorizing her all over her apartment. She's a lonely career woman dominated by her mother and the ending has her possessed by the spirit of the doll waiting for mama to come over. A great ending. The movie is Black's show all the way.

I definently recommend this movie, but as a comedy. how did he open the freakin doors?! and why didn't she just pick him up and break him? and why does she always insist on opening whatever it is that the doll is in? why is it that she can't seem to open the doors or windows in her apartment? did she really hope to drown him? i would say the only really disturbing thing would be the ending. it was the only part that wasn't really all that funny.",1033171200,,758,3.9934210526315788
1234635,3,B00000JLWQ,"I was 12 years old when this ""made for television"" movie first aired. The only part of the movie I actually had any recollection of was, of course, the little Zuni devil doll running across the floor. That was enough for it to remain in my memory as being a very scary movie. When I saw that it was available on DVD, I bought it, hoping to bring back some old childhood memories. What a difference 27 years make.
As the title implies, the film is composed of three short (unrelated) stories, although only the last one can really lay claim to having any sort of terror in it. Karen Black stars in all three stories, in addition to playing a dual role in the second tale. The first story, ""Julie"", casts Black as a dowdy, repressed college professor who is being blackmailed by one of her students. In the second story, ""Millicent and Terese"", Black plays both of the title roles, two sisters at opposite ends of the personality spectrum. Millicent is a prudish spinster who despises her loose and immoral sister Terese. Believing there is no hope for Terese's salvation, Millicent attempts to rescue Terese's current flame from the road to damnation. The third and most famous of the three tales is ""Amelia"" in which Black plays a woman terrorized by a Zuni devil doll which is brought to life after the chain around it's neck accidentally falls off.
The first story works well enough for what it is. Although not terribly original (but then again, maybe in 1975 it was.) it holds the viewers interest, even if it isn't an ""edge of your seat"" thriller. The two leads provide some solid acting. Most viewers, however, will most likely figure out the ending long before it plays out.
The second story is the weakest of the three. Its primary purpose seems to be soley to give Black two different roles to play. This one also contains Black's weakest performance(s). With absolutely no subtlety whatsoever, Black plays each character's cliched personality to the hilt, slamming the viewer over the head with the utter piousness of Millicent and the total taudriness of Terese. This story's conclusion is more obvious to the audience than the first one.
It is the last story that makes this DVD worth buying, but for a totally different reason than what I had origionally thought. The 12 year old in me remembers this story as being very scary. Horrifying even. Watching it now, I howl with laughter. This is such a great campy story. Watching that doll running around the apartment, grunting, and chomping on any body part he can get a hold of is a hoot. Black even does the obligatory ""trip and fall"" (THREE TIMES no less). Watching the little bugger saw his way out of a suitcase is classic. You almost root for the little guy. The story's conclusion is done rather well though, and does still provide a little bit of a chill as well.
The visuals of the DVD are very good as is the sound. There is even a printed interview with Ms. Black (done in ""98"") about the movie. I suspect this DVD's appeal primarily lies with those of us who remember seeing it when it origionally aired on television, but for those of you who love camp, get the DVD and check out what's behind curtain number three.",1032912000,9,3190,4.598245614035088

1234641,4,B00000JLWQ,"This very good three-part 1970s-era TV movie is a veritable cornucopia of talent.  Based on stories by well-known genre author Richard Matheson and directed by Dan Curtis of DARK SHADOWS fame, this film boasts Karen Black (EASY RIDER; FIVE EASY PIECES; THE GREAT GATSBY) in four separate roles, with two teleplays scripted by William F. Nolan (co-author of the famous novel LOGAN'S RUN) and one--the best of the lot--scripted by Matheson.  Also appearing in supporting roles are well-known actors George Gaynes and Gregory Harrison.
Story one, ""Julie,"" is an intentionally ambiguous witchcraft tale in which Black portrays a bookish college professor who isn't quite what she seems.  The story contains some very subtle rape and S&M innuendo, and there is a fun little twist to the ending.  ""Millicent and Therese,"" the second offering, is the weakest of the lot.  Although Black does a fine job in the dual role of bickering ""sisters,"" the audience can see the ending coming from miles away.  The final and strongest of the three stories, ""Amelia,"" is based on Matheson's famous short-story ""Prey"" about a voodoo fetish doll that comes to life and hunts down a woman in her midtown apartment. The ending to this one is very creepy.
All in all, TRILOGY OF TERROR is a worthy little horror flick.  Though it is a TV movie  la 1975 and therefore suffers from some of the low-budget production qualities common to such, it certainly offers some fun moments of dark humor and a few genuine scares.  The print used to make the DVD has some noticeable scratches and spots that could've been cleaned up digitally, but it's still definitely worth the price of admission.",1002844800,94,1662,4.92831541218638

1234643,5,B00000JLWQ,"Director Dan Curtis presents this 1975 collection of horror based on ONE woman playing FOUR roles in THREE scary and twisted stories.
The first story is about a teacher who is being blackmailed by one of her students,Chad,with whom she hade affair with. After ending thier""relationship"",Chad finds himself igniting a situation that he may not be able to end....ever.
The second tale is about two sisters,Millicent and Therese,who hate eachother's guts. To protect herself,Millicent takes matters into her own hands and the ""two""sisters end up tangled in a spell of witchcraft with consequeneces.
The last story,which is my favorite,Amelia just bought her new boyfreind a Zuni hunter doll for his birthday. According to legend,if the chain around his waist is ever removed,an evil spirit will be unrestrained. When Amelia gets the doll,she loosens the chain after a fight with her mother and unleashes a raging beast with one intention..........to kill!
Trilogy of Terror is a great horror movie with chills,thrills,and nonstop action. This is a movie highly recommended to everyone. If you don't see this,the Zuni hunter knows where you live!",998352000,7,1142,5.314917127071824

It was always the scariest movie to me, especially the hunting doll part.  I thought my kids would be scared and my 13 year old just laughed and said it looked stupid.  I know compared to the new movies it probably is lame but everytime I watch this movie it brings back memories of me watching it at 10 or so and being afraid to put my feet on the floor!

But the very end of that last film short showing what happens to Karen Black after her scuffle with this voodoo doll- now THAT ending makes it worth it!!! Watch it during the day or with all the lights on, and with someone!!! Great movie to own!! A bit camp, but then all movies are in their own way, right?!",996624000,,597,4.067796610169491

If I'd seen this when it came out in '75, there would have been no dolls in my room. Period. The thing is uggggleeee and the sounds it made?  Man!  That last scene at the door is very disturbing.
You definitely DON'T want your child watching this unless you have a Jr. Stephen King or Dean Koontz in the house.  Then again, kids today are pretty much desensitized to dolls with attitudes.

Thinking back, I wish my parents hadn't let me watch it (ok, not really), because during and after the Zuni sketch, my legs went somehow numb from sheer fright! I was terrified!  Even years later, my folks would mess with me if I wasn't behaving by making those doll sounds, and I would freak out and fly right!  Over the years, we always rented it for Halloween, watching the first two somewhat lame segments just to build up to the grand finale...the ever-dreaded Zuni fetish doll...scares me just to type out that name!

1234662,3,B00000JLWQ,"I just got Trilogy of Terror from Amazon after anxiously awaiting it. I remember seeing Trilogy of Terror on TV when I was a kid. I was so thrilled to see that it was available on VHS. This movie scared the hell out of me as a child and I was hoping some of the ""magic"" would still be there. Needless to say it wasn't but it wasn't a complete waste of time either.
  Like most other reviewers I found the first two segments to be very forgettable and somewhat boring.
  The third segment with the Zuni fetish doll chasing Amelia (played by Karen Black) is the best and most frightening of the three segments.
  While I still found this segment to be frightening, it had a completely different effect on me than when I was a kid. Instead of being afraid of the doll like I was- I was more frightened by the fear in Amelia's face when she was being chased by it. This totally convincing performance by Karen Black is what saves this segment and maybe the entire movie from falling into complete oblivian.",980208000,6,1002,4.331550802139038

The first story about a student blackmailing is an okay segment(not good enough)the 2nd story about an evil sister is about the rank of the 1st one.but the last story to trilogy made the movie possible! Its about a zuni doll chasing a girl amelia(karen black)because its chain was removed.the ending might make you cry or shiver or gasp. Its gotta do one of those! thats my review for trilogy of terror!,972518400,,538,4.614583333333333
1234664,5,B00000JLWQ,"Soooo  -- there is not much I can add to the glowing remarks of those reviewers preceding me.  One thing does puzzle me, and that is why no one has marketed Mr. Zuni, as they have done with Buzz Lightyear, GI Joe, or the ubiquitous Barbie and Ken.  Surely a screen icon like Zuni, with viewer recognition equal to that of King Kong, Robbie the Robot, or the good 'ol Creature From the Black Lagoon, would have no trouble holding his own in the marketplace. A foot high Robbie, with minute details, voice activation, and a remote control, can be had for a hefty sum. I would think that an enterprising model maker could duplicate the original Zuni in exact detail, add a voice chip with original soundtrack samples, and make a nice profit, retailing under 100 bucks.  I would certainly get one!
Permit me to also mention the sequel to ""Trilogy"", with Lysette Anthony. She is perfect for the part, and the remake, is almost just as good as the original. Zuni is great, but his acting abilities and his disposition, haven't improved much.  The interesting thing about this film, is that it begins only a few hours after the original story concludes, but was made 25 odd years later.  Dan Curtis is a genius!!! It is fun to watch these films back to back, but.....even now, I bring the dogs in, and leave  some lights on....

P.S. -- It is 9 years after the above comments, and,,, Mr. Zuni is now available right here on Amazon for 60 bucks~!~!~!
Awwwrightty~!~!~!
I will put him on the shelf next to Stripe from Gremlins, and see how they get along together~!~!~!

1234665,4,B00000JLWQ,"This popular TV movie from ""Dark Shadows"" creator Dan Curtis has  maintained its solid reputation mostly because of the last tale presented,  ""Amelia"", about a possessed devil doll, but all three tales are  extremely effective on their own level. In ""Julie"", a shy,  seemingly repressed schoolteacher is blackmailed by one of her students,  which has some dire consequences. The next offbeat offering,  ""Millicent and Therese"" is truy a most unusual tale of sibling  rivalry. And the final segment,""Amelia"", which has elevated this  movie into horror heaven, has a beautiful woman being terrorized by a tiny  devil doll which comes to life in her apartment. The sexy and talented  Karen Black stars in all three segments and effectively displays her  amazing versatility. Though I give all three segments equal credit, I am  compelled to admit that the third segment was indeed way ahead of its time  and features some truly startling effects worthy of a theatrical release.
