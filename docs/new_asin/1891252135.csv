202106,5,1891252135,"I have been doing Ashtanga Yoga for over 12 years now.  I have tried many Ashtanga DVDs but David Swenson's series has always been my favorite and now the only ones that I currently own.  I once purchased the entire DVD set and would later give the Short Forms away to a friend.  I have no repurchased it, because this is my goto workout DVD of the series.

I have used this DVD as help in a time crunch or to help me rebuild after a break of yoga.  I love this DVD and will continue to recommend this to anyone whom is interested in Ashtanga Yoga practice.

Thank you",1461283200,2,568,4.118181818181818

202108,5,1891252135,"I never leave reviews but after a decade of disappointing yoga videos I felt this one was warranted. Hopefully it will help someone pull the trigger. So, I have been in a beginners ashtanga class for 10 years... Occasionally the class is more advanced depending on who is In it. I've been begging my teacher to make her own video since her schedule was limited and with no success, I tried other videos and yoga studios. The videos are always so much fluff ""exhale all the stresses of your day"" yadda yadda.... And in person the energy of the teachers were never right or they talked too much. I want to do the yoga, enjoy it, relax, challenge myself and not hear much talking. WELL! This video is great.... Great option for short sessions. His voice is soft and not abrasive. He talks a little much explaining postures but without all the fluff and it doesn't take away from the practice and you can easily go into the next posture without waiting for him to finish explaining. It was an easy listen and a wonderful practice. I now have something to add to my routine and am very excited about it!",1445558400,,1098,4.467661691542289

I have listened to this over and over without getting bored or tired of it. The 15 minute routine is great when you are short on time. The 30 minute is a nice daily routine.

Perfect for when you have a lot of time or if you only have a few minutes.  But what I love the most about this video is that he reminds you that it is about the breathing first and the poses come second. If you cannot get into a certain posture, or get tired, or don't think you can do a pose as good as the guy on the screen, just keep breathing, you'll get better at the poses as you go along.  He reminds you that it is ""your"" practice, that you are not in competition, and to do the best you can and don't push yourself  beyond your limits.",1414627200,5,710,4.057142857142857

David is an excellent teacher and explains thing so clearly that even a beginner understands exactly what he is talking about.  If you are looking for HD quality picture, you might be disappointed.  But for me, the quality of the instruction is so great that I don't notice that any more.

I have tried many forms of yoga, but always find myself coming back to ashtanga, even if I have used some Yogalign modifications. Also, I have always come back to my David Swenson videos, as I really enjoy the relaxing and clear manner in which he teaches.

Knowing David Swenson's comprehension of this style, I feel confident in his ability to provide a balanced abridgment of the complete form. Personally, I find myself doing the 45 minute set 3-4 times a week, and the full 90 minute form (not on this DVD) 1-2 times a week.

He is also good at providing alternative/beginner postures.",1386979200,,705,4.715447154471545

You have 15-min, 30, or 45. If you find 45-minute isn't enough, then you are someone that should be doing the full 90-minute routines. Me personally after all my years in fitness I have come to the realization you can get all you need in 30-minutes in anything if you do it right. I am no Yogi expert, but I feel there isn't a hard rule that a routine as to be 90-minutes. So if you fall into the category as I have, then get this. Just in cardio alone I am using methods and tools that are giving me better results in 4 to 8 minutes versus the 30 to 60-minutes I used to spend. I wonder if that can carry over to Yoga. It might, or it might not but if you don't have the time or don't care to be spending more than 45-minutes on the mat, then get David's DVD.",1383523200,3,966,4.06282722513089

202128,5,1891252135,"I was very happy with this purchase. I love the speed at which the instructor performs the exercises, fast enough to work up some heat and not too quick to not be able to benefit from the poses. HOWEVER, I do not think that it would be good for a true beginner. I have been practicing yoga for about a year now so I am still a learner, but I wouldn't consider myself a complete beginner anymore. His voice is very clear, and it remains soothing throughout the movements. His explanation and guiding words are done well enough that there was very little need to look at the screen, except for where I wanted to get better with my form.

202131,5,1891252135,"I highly recommend this DVD if you have gone to a few Ashtanga classes and know what you're getting in to. If you have never been to an Ashtanga class, and do not know what this demanding style is all about, I do not recommend this or any other Ashtanga DVD. I would recommend going to a class or two first so you know what to expect, otherwise this style of yoga may confound you.  Some folks have complained about the pace of the asanas on this DVD as being too quick, when in actuality the pace is quite slow compared to the full first series.

David's first full series DVD is great, but, a little (ok, a lot) too much for me. I tire out in the middle of surya namaskara B, and even if I skip 3 or 4 of them rarely am able to make it through to the seated series. I lose the breath (which is arguably what yoga is all about), and my form goes haywire.

That is why this DVD is perfect for me. The 30 minute series he has created (there are 3 of varying lengths to chose from) and presented on this DVD is exactly what I needed.  It is allowing me to build my practice safely and sanely.

This DVD was designed for folks like me who aren't quite ready to take on the full first series, and need a stepping stone.

With the preliminaries I mentioned above, I highly recommend this DVD.  David is a master yogi and a fantastic teacher.  Good luck.",1370304000,,1348,4.098859315589354
202132,4,1891252135,"Bought this because I really wanted to begin a practice of Ashtanga Yoga for strength training.  This DVD isn't at all for beginners. Just be aware of that.  The 30 minute short form still wears me out - but it is helping my upper body strength.  Like anything else, the more you try, the better you will become.  I am incredibly impressed by this man's ability, but it is a little discouraging to be instructed to do quite a number of vinyasa when you can't even do one. Just saying.  If you already know what you are doing, then I highly recommend this. Especially for an opportunity to watch this guy in action.  If you are beginning, purchase  something centered toward beginners - and then work your way up to this after you've got it down.",1369872000,2,745,4.4338235294117645

It is not basic nor beginner yoga, if that is what you are looking for. I would recommend you read a bit about Ashtanga to learn if this is right for you. It is also great as a training tool when you don't have 75-90 minutes to complete the entire Ashtanga primary series.",1368748800,,407,4.1645569620253164

I am not in bad shape; I do aerobic exercises 3-4 a week, yoga, 2x a week, strength exercises 3x a week.  I read good reviews about this DVD and that is the only reason I bought this.  This video was moving way too fast for me.  Look, I've watch just the short form of the 15 minute segment and who can do yoga in 15 minutes?  He went right away into these forms and poses.  I've hurt my thighs following this guy's method!  He should have warned beginners should do a warm-up before trying these supposedly ""beginner"" poses.  Unfortunately, after I watched this video and followed along, it was a big mistake.  (Especially when you pull a muscle doing the poses to follow along with him). The forms are not at all for beginners.  As a matter of fact, the intro of the video the instructor is seen doing extravagant and crazy poses.  Clearly, he is a flexible teacher.  I just don't think this is a good video for beginners of yoga.",1361145600,2,1023,4.321052631578947

202140,5,1891252135,"I only have time for the full primary series about once a week, so I've looked for shorter options that offered more than a yawn and a stretch. This DVD is THE ONE.

The first time I practiced with this DVD I actually had to go thru it a second time because the first time I ended up just watching. I've never seen yoga practiced as beautifully as David Swenson. I know ""there's no such thing as a perfect pose,"" but if there were, his would be the closest thing to it.  And because he moves with such fluidity and ease, I actually better understand (for the first time) the mechanics of the flow and some of the poses.

I love Tony Horton and Bryan Kest, and I enjoy the instructors at my studio. But I learned more just WATCHING David Swenson.",1342742400,4,745,4.232394366197183

202144,5,1891252135,"No one said Ashtanga is easy, but the demanding style can be addictive, a good addiction; however, because of its physical rigors it's easy--at least I find it easy--to lose sight of the fact that the focus has to be chiefly on the internals, the breath and the bandhas and the gaze. Swenson's Short Forms DVD keeps reminding me of that, and it's a useful reminder especially when I'm pressed for time, which makes it even easier to let the concentration slip. Swenson is a master practitioner and teacher. He has intelligently selected poses for abbreviated practice sessions. I have another Ashtanga DVD with abbreviated practices on it and it's good but Swenson's is just superb. He also offers variations on poses in recognition that many viewers will not be able to do the full versions at first, and he's comforting too, reassuring me that I'm not a wuss if I need to modify a pose. It's a wonderful tool I recommend strongly.",1331683200,4,932,4.723926380368098

My husband will do the 15 min. if he's short on time, but we find the 30 min. workout feels the best.  The 45 min is a little too advanced for us so when we want a longer workout we go with Rodney Yee. (we've both been practicing yoga for several years and we find ourselves well past the beginner stage but not anywhere near being able to perform some of the more advanced moves that are awe-inspiring but don't feel doable) True, the production quality of some of the newer DVD's are beautiful but don't be fooled by the shiny covers, David Swenson is the best!

I continue to use Short forms as a how to DVD. I have viewed short forms many, many times. Ashtanga Yoga, The Practice, the Primary Series, a DVD and the Manual, Ashtanga Yoga, The Practice Manual, both also by David Swenson, are equally superior and useful.

If you are up to some challenges, the 45 min workout incorporates more asanas. However, between each side of asana, there's no flow. I feel that there's not enough warm up for that workout and I feel rushed. If you are looking for a shorter Ashtanga workout, you can follow the primary series for all the standing poses, then take a few asana, then do the finishing poses without skipping the flow in between.

But this DVD is different - with 3 workouts to choose from - super short 15 minutes, decent stretch 30 minutes and finally almost a full workout at 45 minutes, it seems a more practical tool than the full first series.  I can't give it 5 stars however because Swenson doesn't give a whole lot of instruction or tips.  I don't really like somebody ""chirpy"" and ""perky"" leading my yoga workout, but I do like the idea of a little more personality than D.

Various options are always given for those (like me) who are not as flexible as David Swenson.

His voiceover narration is well done and makes the routines well suited for the intermediate to advanced student of yoga.  My yoga studio closed down and this is my replacement and I am very satisified.  Highly recommend this DVD.,1269043200,5,426,4.794520547945205
202159,4,1891252135,Great. Exactly what I needed for my busy schedule. Now I have no excuse fitting yoga into my day. Great for people on the go.,1266019200,7,125,4.04
202160,5,1891252135,"I absolutely love Doug Swenson's yoga practice.  I consider myself at a moderate level in yoga & have taken ashtanga classes previously which is why I purchased this DVD.  I have his full primary series which is also great (however can be intricate), but don't always have 90 minutes for yoga.  This is great so I can get a yoga session at any time frame.  Doug Swenson has been my favorite DVD yoga instructor (I have 3 others).  Each time session is filmed specifically for that time session (as opposed to others that just cut parts out of the longer one to have shorter sequences).  He also thoroughly explains technique & re-emphasizes doing each technique at whatever level you have & BREATHING.  His voice exudes calm tranquility, another huge plus.  I definitely recommend taking ashtanga classes before doing any DVD, but this would be a good starter without any classes.",1262995200,,880,4.82
202161,5,1891252135,"For yoga enthusiasts who want want the real deal to prepare them for the eventuality of a more rigorous Ashtanga style practice - without frippery - this is a great video. Yes there was a lot of things David did that I will not be able to do for a very long time, but it is a great introduction to the more athletic style of yoga called Ashtanga. I enjoyed the options for sessions of varying times, so you can sculpt the practice to your availability. It is demanding but this is a way into preparing yourself for the Ashtanga beginners so it fitted what I needed.
If I have to criticise anything then it would be that I would have preferred a very austere setting such as a room with none of the usual yoga video distractions [you know the ones - vases of flowers, ornaments, billowing curtains, alters, buddhas, statues of this and that] and solid contrast lighting, rather than the daylight garden setting David used.
This is purely because I think there is better contrast between the movements and correct muscle use when the background is very plain. The garden setting is lovely but its too busy for me with flowers and shrubbery. But I realise others enjoy the background.",1260921600,,1181,4.549295774647887

It contains three abbreviated routines (15, 30, and 45 minutes) based on the Primary Series but geared to advanced beginners or intermediate practitioners.  David Swenson is an excellent instructor who adopts a leisurely pace that allows you to sink into each posture and focus on alignment.  His commentary throughout is calm and to the point.  I turn to this DVD more often than any other single yoga DVD and it's helped my practice tremendously.",1252022400,,590,4.989795918367347

David guides you through each practice, usually holding each pose for 5 breaths. It's a smooth practice but a challenging one. The poses are not impossible and at first I was asking myself why doesn't it go faster like Rodney Yee or Baron Baptiste's workouts. Then I found myself feeling it all and really opening up. Not to say that the former instructors are bad, I alternate the workouts depending on my mood. One thing I love about this practice is the lack of mood music. None. Just David instructing you without any extra commentary. One thing I learned from this practice is that with the amount of DVDs I own (less than 10) each one can be performed depending on my mood and need that day. Alternating them also keeps me on my toes and prevents me from anticipating the next pose and getting bored. I've disposed of all of my other workout DVDs, i.e. cardio and Pilates, and now stick to solely yoga.",1248393600,5,1060,4.554973821989528

However, I feel it moves a little too quickly between poses. You hold each pose for 5 breaths by the time I get into a pose Doug Swenson is already on 3 breaths.  I don't get to hold the poses long enough once I get into them.  I'm not quite as flexible as Doug!",1199491200,,395,3.9
202171,5,1891252135,"This is a good way to fit a bit of yoga into your daily routine.  Swenson goes through the poses at good rate and doesn't shy away from the hard stuff, although he also gives alternatives if you find a pose too challenging.  I regularly go to vinyasa yoga classes, and I was looking for a DVD to use when I travel -- something shorter than the full Ashtanga series, but not something aimed at beginners.  I really like the flexibility of being able to choose a 15-, 30- or 45-minute workout, and the deep relaxation and the end is very pleasant.

I'm not very good with the Sanscrit names, so here is a summary in English (from memory, probably incomplete) of the poses in the 45-minute workout.  He does them in the right order, so if you practice Ashtanga and want to do a pose that he leaves out, you can just pause the DVD at the right place and do it.

sun salutations A and B, 3 each
forward bend
triangle
wide-stance triangle
wide-legged forward bend
balancing on one leg with the other one in front
half-lotus and fold, or tree pose
warriors, A and B

seated postures (vinyasas between many of these):
staff pose
forward bend
forward bend in half lotus
forward bend with one foot on the inner thigh of the other leg
marichiasana A and B (spine twists)
boat pose (3 reps)
backbend (1 prep, with your shoulders on the floor, then the option to do one full backbend)
forward bend as counter-pose

I tend to have a busy mind and am not the typical ""meditation guy"" but this Deep Relaxation routine works wonders for me whenever I use it (almost every day). There are several high quality Ashtanga products (books, DVD's and CD') out there but D. Swenson is my favorite. I also like his First Series and Just Relax DVD.",1196812800,,494,4.625

The instruction is clear and helpful without any unwanted or distracting talk.  I also love that the 45 min. segment includes both headstand and shoulderstand.  It is a very complete practice for 45 min.  The 15 min. segment is a wonderful short practice that really gets you warmed up and stretched.  The 30 min. segment is a little slower and a nice pace for an easier day or an add-on.,1194220800,,524,4.295918367346939
202174,3,1891252135,"This set of short yoga classes is a compromise. It could be more or less useful if you have been practising yoga for a considerable period of time, but for beginners it is not that great.

I found that the 45 minute program does not provide enough warm-up and, naturally, skips some postures, so I was not prepared for some asanas, my muscles were still somewhat tight and not warm enough to do the asanas comfortably. I still was able to do all the postures, it just did not feel quite right.
You can use this DVD when there is no time and a short form would be better than no form at all, but, in my opinion, yoga likes long forms.",1191196800,14,633,4.188524590163935

Swenson is a great yoga teacher--no frills, no fancy stuff, just meat n' potatoes good yoga. I also really like that he doesn't talk in a corny, new-agey voice or have new-agey music in the background. (There is no background music.) His yoga is down to the bare essentials, and I really appreciate that. I also like his challenging yet adequate pace. He practices Ashtanga yoga, and though I'm not really sure how it's different from power yoga, I think they're pretty comparable in their pace and strenuousness. Postures are held for 5 breaths and then you move on (and continue to sweat). I wouldn't recommend this for absolute beginners unless you're already in pretty good shape. I highly recommend watching his introduction before watching the routines for the first time. I really recommend this DVD over Rodney Yee's power yoga DVD. David Swenson is a much better, more accurate and more 'authentic' yoga teacher in my opinion. I would also recommend gettting Swenson's book on Ashtanga yoga that recommends alternative positions (more of them than he describes on the DVD) and just more details about yoga. Overall, I'm really happy with David Swenson's style of yoga teaching.",1190592000,,1303,4.927272727272728

I thought it could be good for me too. However, when I have time to do a whole one hour session, the 45 min practice seems too jammed to me. After its completion, I didn't feel as stretched as I normally do after the yoga class. I think the reason behind it is that he was trying to put all the postures into the 45 minutes program, and didn't hold them long enough to really make your muscles work. Same program but with postures held longer would make good 1 hr practice. But still it is my favorite among other yoga practice DVDs I've tried. Right level of difficulcy.",1165449600,14,747,4.3428571428571425
202182,5,1891252135,"This is a challenging program that consists of 3 choices:

15 Min: Quick practice, but I haven't used a whole lot

30 Min: Geared towards beginners, this is a great, quick practice.

45 Min: Intermediate practice, I love this one...quite challenging!

10 Min Relaxation: Add to any of the practices above, very nice!

I love the 45 min practice. Each of the shorter practices are very similar, but less postures are performed. Doug Swenson is a soft spoken, very clear instructor. He reminds you to breath and 5 breaths are counted at each posture. He also reminds you that this is your practice and don't go beyond your limit. In most of the postures he uses the Sanskrit name :o)

This practice is not for a newbie to yoga; it will definitely help the advanced beginners and intermediate level build rhythm, flow, and grace! He has many postures and variations that you will not see on other DVDs. I like to pace of the class and you'll feel like you got a great workout in a short amount of time. I would recommend practicing in a warm room to help with flexibility.

It is filmed at Mercer Arboretum in Seattle on a beautiful wetland boardwalk with bright green foliage and beautiful blue flowers covering the landscape.

3 rounds each of sun salutation A & B (down dog is held for 5 full breaths)

Forward Bending

Triangle

Side Angle

Wide Leg Forward Bend

Standing Forward Leg Extension

Tree (with optional forward bend)

I could easily catch on and he gives achievable alternatives when you can't do the full technique.  It was also very encouraging to hear ""don't worry if you can't do the full exercise, just focus on your breathing"".  As a non-American, I can sometimes find the US accent annoying especially when teaching (harsh but true).  Luckily David's voice is easy to listen to. Make sure you don't skip the intro.  It gives a good basis and direction for the practice.  It was so accessible I even got my hubby to try it out with me.  But I didn't show him the demo David does.  That would have totally freaked him out as he watched a grown man turn himself inside out.",1159920000,5,760,4.449275362318841
202184,5,1891252135,"This DVD is an excellent tool for those interested in beginning Ashtanga yoga, but who don't have access to an Ashtanga teacher (like me) or just feel more comfortable practicing at home.  It is a very basic, beginner-level DVD.  When I write ""beginner-level"" I am refering to a beginner in Ashtanga yoga.  I practiced yoga on-and-off for a couple of years at a yoga studio before I got this DVD and still found it moderately challenging.

The DVD is broken-up into three different routines (15 minute, 30 minute, 45 minute) with an additional guided relaxation.  The 15 minute routine is okay.  I watched it once, but have never done it.  I suppose it would be useful for someone who didn't have much time, but I recommend that you make a point of doing at least the 30 minute routine.

The 30 minute routine is perfect for those just starting.  For me, it's perfect for those mornings when I can't motivate to do a full practice.  It goes very quickly!  I did this routine exclusively for a couple of months (2-3 times per week) when I first got the DVD.

The 45 minute routine is challenging without being overwhelming.  I did this routine for a couple of months before I ventured into the full Ashtanga Primary Series (I also used Mr. Swenson's DVD for that).

This DVD is a great choice and I recommend it highly.  I also recommend that you take your time building up to a full Ashtanga practice.  Spending a few months or even a year doing these modified ""beginner"" routines is fine.  Don't push yourself into the full Primary Series until you are ready.  There are no awards for completing the Primary Series in the shortest possible time.  You have your whole life to do yoga.  Take it easy.",1147824000,35,1699,4.562913907284768

You have room for your own interpretation in a pose.  The setting is beautiful, and you will feel like you've had a good workout in very little time.

Don't expect precise technique of the postures.  Swenson helps you keep a good pace, emphasizes your breathing over your postures, and reminds you that this is always practice. Straight-forward production, clear visuals, good narration, no over-done music, and an intro demo that'll make your jaw drop.",1127433600,8,514,5.192771084337349

I never got sick of it and it got me to love yoga, especially ujjayi breathing.  This is just pure ashtanga with no fluff.  David Swenson is a no-nonsense instructor who shows great modifications for beginners and gives tips for proper form.  You won't hear any New Age-y talk if that turns you off from some yoga videos.  The demo at the beginning of the video showcases the flexibility and strength he has gained from years of practice.  There is no music during the main routine, but the 10 minute guided relaxation has soothing music.

** June 15, 2013 Quick update - 8 years later this DVD stands the test of time. Classic ashtanga by a world class teacher. I had the privilege of taking a live class with David Swenson this year and he's not as serious in person - great sense of humor and very down to earth.",1114646400,76,1111,4.349514563106796
202188,5,1891252135,"Quick is a relative term.  Normally the Primary Series takes about 1.5-2 hrs to complete, so 15-45 minutes is fast considering.  In David Swenson's Practice Manual there are 3 of what Swenson refers to as Short Forms.  These Short Forms are 15, 30, and 45 minutes respectively.  They are geared for people who either don't have the 90 minutes required to complete the entire Primary Series, or people who are not ready for the entire Primary Series.  Swenson's instruction is awesome.  He guides you through the modified versions of the Primary Series in very reassuring and expert manner.  Swenson also offers some modifications for some of the more difficult poses.  This DVD makes the Primary Series more approachable.  I would suggest watching the DVD (or at least the practice time you select) all the way through before doing it (unless you are familar with Swenson's book and have some experience with Short Forms already).  Swenson has a great demo at the beginning of the DVD, very inspiring.  To truly get the benefit of the DVD, order his book along with the DVD to get the best of both worlds.  I think almost anyone could benefit from this DVD, as long as the person keeps in mind that this is a very physical style of yoga, and will make most (novice to intermediate especially) practioners sweat.",1104969600,78,1311,4.777777777777778

Never have I been so disappointed from an Amazon purchase and misled from the overwhelmingly chipper reviews. I found the tape frustrating, lacking clear instructions or enough ""variations"" of the poses for people who aren't contortionists. You indeed need to watch the tape a few times to even attempt to keep up with the pace. Unless you really are comfortable with yoga for a few years, I say try another tape. I'm going right now to sell mine online. I hope someone buys it.",1091059200,2,655,5.018348623853211

All three workouts consist of a lot of sun salutations and basic stretches, so if you are looking for more variety in poses, or are an advanced student, you would be better to get the advanced series by David. If you are new to yoga, this is a good video, although it may be a good idea to get a book and learn sun salutations, as not much detail was given on this pose sequence.  Ashtanga yoga is truly the ultimate workout, benefitting cardio and strength as well as flexibility. It is a true eastern yoga form, based on Raja yoga.  Unlike Bikram ""hot"" yoga, a western creation, you do not need to turn up the temperature in the room.  Your body generates its own heat,during the exercise,  so you are loose and flexible, ready to stretch.  You will feel incredibly energized and feel the pain ease from tired muscles within just 15 minutes!",1080518400,,1009,4.306878306878307
202192,5,1891252135,"I have been practicing yoga for the last four years.  My first experience with yoga came via a video by Rodney Yee.  Soon afterward, I purchased ""The Practice Manual"" (a book by David Swenson).  I was amazed at the depth and accuracy of the asanas in ""The Practice Manual"".  As a result, I eventually purchased this video (actually, I have it on DVD, but Amazon doesn't currently carry the DVD).
Mr. Swenson introduces the video by admitting that most people don't have 1.5 hours per day to practice yoga (which is what the full Primary Series of Ashtanga Yoga demands).  Over the years, he has adapted many of the asanas from the Primary Series into shorter 15, 30, and 45 minute sessions.  I have practiced each of the varying sessions on the video, and I find them all useful for what they are.
If I simply don't have much time, the 15 minute session helps abate the guilt of not doing any exercise in a given day.  I sometimes choose the 30 minute workout in the morning because I don't have the energy to perform some of the more demanding asanas (postures) that the 45 minute workout requires.  I practice the 45 minute routine when I'm ready for a more serious workout.  Sometimes I mix up the different routines for a two-a-day workout.
The instruction is clear and concise.  Alternate postures are provided so that your practice can grow at your pace.  I have particular interest in the alternate positions because my shoulders aren't very flexible.  Through steady practice, I've been able to achieve the more difficult postures because of the less demanding ""alternate"" postures that are provided on the video.  It's quite satisfying to finally touch hands together in Marichyasana A.
Most importantly, this video provides a window to a more involved yoga practice.  The 45 minute workout is a great introduction to the Primary Series (a.k.a. First Series), which is another video by Swenson (and also the main subject of his ""The Practice Manual"" book).  I can easily recommend this video because of the benefits I've experienced through its use.",1075161600,4,2058,4.806818181818182
202193,5,1891252135,I am a beginner who has tried yoga before but never made the commitment to keep  it up.  The 15 minute workout is just right for me to get started.  And the relaxation portion caps it off.  David Swenson does not talk too much and all that he says is relevent to the routine so you don't get sick of listening to this tape over and over.  His voice is soothing and soft.  I am working my way up to the longer routines.  If this is available on dvd it would be easier to switch from one routine to another.,1061424000,4,505,3.99
202194,5,1891252135,"I ordered this video about a year and a half ago, and it sat on my shelf until rather recently. Now I remembered why I bought it. And boy, am I sorry that I let the thing languish on my shelf. I've been using the 30 minute workout in the morning, and the 45 minute session when I get home from work, and I don't think I can get sick of it.
David Swenson's voice is so calming, and he provides just the right encouragement. I really like the breath cues, and the emphasis on ""it's YOUR practice, do only what you can do, but don't be afraid to challenge yourself"". I find myself losing all sense of time and easily moving into a meditative state when I do this tape. Which is basically the point of yoga. The tape is that good.
I prefer Swenson's presentation over Richard Freeman's. While Freeman has his strengths as a teacher, something about Swenson just clicks with me. Maybe it's because he lets you stay in the pose a bit longer, to really feel it.
Although the tape is great for those beginning to study Ashtanga and for people who consider themselves ""advanced"" when it comes to flexibility, I would not recommend this tape to the beginning yogi/yogini, unless you have a lot of natural pretzel in you.",1029110400,24,1210,4.3822222222222225
202195,5,1891252135,"And many thanks also to those who had already reviewed Short Forms...I based my purchase on your opinions.
I've flirted with yoga in an irregular manner for the past few years, knowing that it is right for me, but never finding the correct focus until now.  Ashtanga yoga as presented by David Swenson in a calm (not boring), caring and genuinely enthusiatic manner has truly caught me.  The movement and breathing, unifying body, mind and environment seemed to have been the magic key.
I would rank myself an intermediate beginner in things yoga and find the 30 minute workout approachable, yet challenging enough to take me down the road awhile.  I also have Rodney Yee's Power Yoga DVD which although beautifully filmed, I found the pace too quick and poses too difficult.  The lack of guidance was also disturbing.
In contrast, David Swenson provides significant guidance for each pose, including breathing, physical warnings, attitude orientation and genuine encouragement without being ""icky"", as well as providing alternatives for beginner to advanced practitioners.  The instruction is very clear which is especially important to those who have never had formal yoga instruction.  Short Forms is beautifully filmed (although I actually swatted my tv a couple of times only to find it was one of many bees on David's side of the video) including superior tonal quality.
I am very happy with my purchase and expect to use this video for a very long time.  With enough practice and self-discipline I can finally move out of the beginner's ranks and perhaps even approach the full primary series.  And hey, I just found out there's an Ashtanga class in English right here in Tokyo that I'm going to look into.",1022371200,19,1713,4.985964912280702
202196,5,1891252135,"This is the best of the Power Yoga offerings I have tried. Mr. Swenson is precise and helpful in all his comments.  The 45 min workout has a soothing, energizing effect on body/mind and prepares one to any activity.  Looking forward to the First Series follow up. Highly recommended.",1017187200,3,283,4.755102040816326
202197,5,1891252135,"This video is certainly as good as it gets. David Swenson is a true master at ashtanga yoga and is an amazing teacher. His instruction is crystal clear and his demonstrations are awe inspiring. There was a negative comment made in a previous review (in fact the only negative review) about there being ""too much chatter"". I must disagree completely with this statement because I find the instructions very useful throughout the tape. When doing a practice like this it is very helpful to have constant reminders of what to focus on because there is so much to be aware of at the same time. Also, often when you're in certain postures it is impossible to be ""looking"" at the screen so those verbal instructions are invaluable to help you stay aware of all the subtle things you must be mindful of as well as to help with the pacing of the practice.
  I'd like to use a musical analogy to describe how good this tape is. Imagine if you could have a great virtuoso like Vladimir Horowitz or Alfred Brendel somehow guiding you along as you practiced the piano. Mr. Swenson is a true world class ""virtuoso"" at ashtanga yoga, and more than in just the physical part of it, he always trys to make you aware of the spiritual side of the practice as you go along.",1008288000,6,1254,4.471615720524017
202198,5,1891252135,"Wow, this tape is great.  The 15 minute session is really good, amazing that you can do so much in 15 minutes.  And the 45 minute one is perfect for me.  I have found the whole primary series 90-minutes workout to be too tiring, but this 45 minute one is exactly to my liking.",1001203200,7,276,4.074074074074074
202199,5,1891252135,"This is a great video to use for practice when you're starting out with Ashtanga Yoga.  Swenson patiently guides you through Short Forms that are based on the first series of Ashtanga Yoga.  He gives advice on how to adjust a pose to make it right for you & me - those of us who aren't yet as flexible as Swenson.  Being able to do a practice that lasts only 15 minutes makes it much more likely to actually do it, too!",999216000,5,419,4.085365853658536
202200,5,1891252135,"This video is a great video. I think it's great that David doesn't use any music throughout the workout, not until the relaxation part. I like that because you can listen to the music of your choice while still listening to his instructions throughout the workout. I just got the video last week. I think it's great. I only wish I would've bought the more advanced one. I was expecting this to be pretty advanced from what I read in the reviews, but it was really basic to me. I have been practicing yoga since 95 and I never considered myself anything above beginner, but the video was easy to me. I could do all the positions and it did not go beyond my regular practice. I still like the video though and I will use it. It'll be good for my practice, but I will still be looking for something more challenging. I recommend this video to absolute beginners, but for the yogi's who have practiced for years and read a lot on yoga, I don't recommend this video except for variety.",998352000,,980,4.360655737704918
202201,4,1891252135,"There's no way this video could be done by an absolute yoga begginer, actually I suggest people bying this video to have practices in parallel with a teacher, for good guidance. I've been doing Hatha and a little ashtanga for 2 years and half, so for me Swenson was awesome.",991353600,2,274,4.5
202202,2,1891252135,"I was very disappointed with this video.  I found Swenson's talkative style distracting and unnecessary.  Rather than allowing you to breath and experience the poses on your own, this tape subjects you to a constant barrage of commentary.  I practice yoga to escape mindless chatter, so this tape wasn't for me.",973468800,4,311,5.0588235294117645
202203,5,1891252135,"I am a beginner to ashtanga and purchased this video for occasional practice sessions.  I love Davids' voice, his attention to the breath and the way he makes the time fly by--I find myself completely engrossed.  It  seems accessable and challenging at the same time.  I am now hooked on  ashtanga and am going to purchase the 1st series.  I have tried Brian  Kest's videos and like them fine, they are a nice, challenging workout, but  I feel much more drawn to David Swensons' style, it is challenging as well,  but his attention to the breath, which I love and his style and voice  really help me stay really focused inside the body, which to me is what  yoga is ultimately all about--heightened awareness, being present in the  body and mind.  I highly recommend this video.",956448000,44,778,4.632352941176471
202204,5,1891252135,"I use this tape at least 3 to 4 times a week for my daily pracice, in addition to doing Ashtanga at my local Yoga Studio.  It is an invaluable resource for any student of Ashtanga to fit into our hectic western  schedules.  With a condensed 15,30 and 45 minute session on the tape, there  is really no excuse for not doing even a little Yoga everyday.  I love  David Swenson, he's one of the first Westerners to learn Ashtanga from J.  Pattabi Jois in Mysore India and this is the ""Real  Deal"".

202205,4,1891252135,"I have studied yoga for 2 years, but when my instructor moved away I stopped practicing. I was giving the tape as a gift so I could continue my practice at home. I was suprised how soothing and calming David Swenson is.  I like how he focuses on doing only what your body can handle. He also is  constantly pointing out the fact that yoga is all about your body, how good  it can feel and not trying to ""push it"" too far. The only slight  downfall is that if you are a total beginner you might be a bit lost until  you learn to recognize the positions. If you are a beginner, I would  recommend just watching the tape first so you reckognize the positions  before trying them out.",946944000,12,680,4.184615384615385

The option of doing 15, 30, or 45 minutes is brilliant! The sessions are thoughtful, doable, and perfectly balanced. I always feel sore the next day, even if I only do the 15 minute. Optional relaxation track is great (but puts me to sleep, because I'm not getting much of that with a baby!). I am starting a new employee next week and we're going to do 15-30 min of yoga to start our workdays every day.
