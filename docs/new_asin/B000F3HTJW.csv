8116845,4,B000F3HTJW,"A typical TV movie of the week-- BUT Liza Minnelli turns in a fine (and award winning) performance that makes this one stand out. True story about a woman helping her young son through the last few months of his life. Liza captures the pain, the strength AND the humor in this heart-rendering forgotten film from the 80's. Liza fans will love it, needless to say.",1227484800,,363,4.515151515151516
