5837790,5,B00DNQGL42,I love the Val Lewton films. They show that horror dosen't always need gore to be scary. So when I heard that TMC was releasing a pack of his movies I was so happy! All four of these movies are great especially Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie. I would recommend them to movie buff.,1387756800,5,287,4.052631578947368
5837791,3,B00DNQGL42,"For Val Lewton fans who have not purchased his films, this contains four of his best at a bargain price. For those who already own the movies (or sets that include these movies) it does not appear that there's anything new, such as restoration - wouldn't that be great! or colorization, which I feel would be novel, assuming the negative or master copy is not colorized. Hey, and what about restoration onto Blu-ray!!! Mmm . . . perhaps Criterion will come to the rescue: all of Val's films could use this - please?",1380412800,6,515,4.548387096774194

5837810,5,B00DNQGL42,"This TCM  film collection is an excellent introduction to the cinematic world of producer Val Lewton. It contains what are probably his 4 best films CAT PEOPLE, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE and THE BODY SNATCHER. Val Lewton (1904-1951) was born into a Russian family headed up by two very strong women, his mother and his famous aunt Alla Nazimova who was a stage and later silent screen star. This resulted in his developing a deep appreciation of the arts at an early age and later treating his female characters with dignity and respect. He was a voracious reader which made him an ideal story editor when he came to Hollywood in the 1930s. He started work under producer David O. Selznick at RKO and later went with him to MGM. After producing the Bastille siege in A TALE OF TWO CITIES (1935) and designing the famous railway long shot of the wounded in GONE WITH THE WIND (1939), he was offered a job at RKO and his famous series of movies began.

Lewton was offered complete autonomy so long as he didn't exceed a budget of $150,000 a film and used the titles the studio gave him. Hoping to cash in on the success of Universal's horror films like THE WOLF MAN (1941), he was asked to form a horror unit and that's how CAT PEOPLE (1942) came about. CAT PEOPLE tells the story of a young Serbian woman who marries an American architect (named Oliver Reed!) but refuses to sleep with him for fear of turning into a panther when aroused. Director Jacques Tourneur, whose father Maurice was a famous silent film director, used all kinds of light and shadow techniques to not only enhance the look of the film but to hide the secondhand sets. The RKO top brass disliked the film for its refusal to show anything graphic and what they considered a too cerebral approach but quickly changed their tune when the film eventually made over a million dollars. Up next came I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE which is essentially JANE EYRE transposed to the West Indies. The film's haunting imagery plus its hypnotic use of native music not to mention the literary source material make it my favorite Lewton movie.

The other two films in this collection are also quite remarkable in their own way. CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE (1944) is not a horror film at all but an exploration of the fantasy world of a lonely child that borrows characters from the first film and then uses them for its own devices. It was considered such an excellent example of a child's loneliness that it was actually studied by psychologists. It also marked the directing debut of film editor Robert Wise who would go onto a major career as director of such classic films as THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and the original THE HAUNTING (1963) which was a tribute to his mentor. Wise also directed THE BODY SNATCHER (1945), based on the story by Robert Louis Stevenson, which gave Boris Karloff one of his best roles by showing that he could act without heavy make-up. The final carriage ride is one of the great horror moments in 1940s cinema.

After THE BODY SNATCHER, Lewton's next few films didn't do well and his unit at RKO was disbanded. He drifted back to MGM, wrote a few unused screenplays and produced 3 more movies including his only color film APACHE DRUMS (1951). He died later that year of a heart attack at the age of 46 without realizing what a major impact he had made on the movie industry (just ask Martin Scorsese who produced a documentary on him, VAL LEWTON - THE MAN IN THE SHADOWS in 2007). Lewton is one of my cinematic heroes but ultimately the proof is in the films themselves and these have stood the test of time. Lewton believed that won't you don't see will scare you more than what you do. Whenever you receive a false scare in a movie today through abrupt editing or a sudden loud sound effect then it's Val Lewton you have to thank. The prints used for this TCM collection come from the earlier complete Val Lewton box set and are excellent considering their age and overall condition.",1440201600,10,4029,4.515068493150685

The viewing quality of the films, Curse of the Cat People, for instance, as for aspect ratio and picture quality, is the best you can buy. I need not review these four films for if you are a fan they are Val Lawton films and represent his work in a fine cohesive collection. We watch this DVD often.
