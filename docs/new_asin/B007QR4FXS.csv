8521071,4,B007QR4FXS,"It's good, very detailed regarding stroke techniques for all strokes and even some strategies.  Vince is really a good communicator.  I'm still not too used the wrist action he talks about in regards to groundstrokes.  I think it's really good for beginners and especially intermediates.  As an advanced player, I already know a lot about what he teaches, but still it's a good review and clarification/ fine-tuning for players of all levels.  Remember Vince was a top 100 ATP player in the world, someone's that been featured in tennis magazines, hit with some of the best and I've seen him play a pro match live and he can really blast the ball, though he lost the match I saw.",1411776000,,679,4.6722689075630255
8521072,5,B007QR4FXS,"I wanted this for xmas and my wife bought it for me.  instead of playing disney dvds in my car for the kids, i'm going to try playing these for the kids, because they remember everything about a movie.  when do you ever get a chance for a top pro giving you tips for reasonable price.  i just turned 41 and a 5.0 ntrp and still looking at ways to improve.  just went through the forehand cd and impressed by the detailed technic that vince demonstrates.  there are a few things that i'm going to try for my forehand that was mentioned.  i highly recommend this, since it's detailed and especially from a high ranked pro.  cant wait to see the rest of the dvd series.",1386633600,,666,4.238095238095238
8521073,5,B007QR4FXS,Very detailed and easily understood systematic teaching method. Vince' easy to comprehend conversational speaking style helped make the material easy to understand. Different views and some repetition helped emphasize key points. Very comprehensive foundational skills covered in depth. Noticed  immediate improvement after applying tips covered in series. Well worth the cost of set. Thanks Vince!,1381276800,,398,6.236363636363636
8521074,5,B007QR4FXS,"I just bought Vince Spadea's DVDs to learn tennis with. After just two days of practicing the DVD instructions on serving, my serves are faster and more accurate than most teachers and students here at my university -and they've been playing for years. What a surprise that was to everyone, especially myself!

Spadea was ranked 18th in the world during his career peak, so the skills and advice he shares are incredibly effective.

I didn't know what to expect from these DVDs. Sometimes experts are hard to follow, but Spadea's instructions are clear and easy to practice. Everything he teaches he shows a few times slowly so you can follow along. After that, he shows you full speed. Spadea has a conversational style that is enjoyable while staying focused on key principles.

I've been practicing everything from these DVDs in slow motion for an hour until it feels natural, then I practice at the court. This method works well and I recommend it.

If you're new to tennis or just want to improve your game, Spadea delivers great advice.
