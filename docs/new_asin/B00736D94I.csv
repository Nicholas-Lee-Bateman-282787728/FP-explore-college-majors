T-ara's live performance here is frankly sub-par, the dances are great but the group look occasionally bored and they rely too much on the backing track for vocals.  I'm pretty sure in the first song they're not even singing at all.  The performance focuses only on the singles and they even do ""Bo Peep"" twice for no apparent reason, why they didn't squeeze in a different song as an encore I don't know.  It borders on insulting to repeat material when fan favourite ""Like The First Time"" or the fantastic ""One And One"" (which would have made a killer opener) aren't even included in the set at all.  Other weaknesses - the stage is fairly gray and drab (by k-pop standards anyway), the outfits are mostly nothing special and not a patch on those in the music videos... speaking of which the performance is also very short leading the DVD maker to pad the thing out with said videos at the end (""Like The First Time"" also annoyingly absent here)... I could go on and on.  BUT I recommend it anyway if you're a massive T-ara fan, simply because it's the only complete T-ara DVD concert you're going to get, at least for now, so you might as well.  T-ara fans are going to want it anyway, and I'm a massive T-ara fanboy so I'm not sorry I bought this, I just wish it was a better quality show at least vocally.  I wouldn't recommend it for someone new to the group though, if anything the poor singing performances may turn them off.  Hopefully T-ara will one day release something of the quality of 2NE1's ""Nolza"", until then I guess this will have to do.",1338768000,,1601,4.436860068259386

Especially in Japan, all girls group called "" KARA"" and "" Girl's Generation"" were most popular. But as usual,last appeared the Queen who will eventually dominate the new kingdom. So, who's the Queen? That's definitely ""T-Ara"",I'm sure. ""KARA"" have no talent but goddess of luck smiled upon them. ""Girl's Generation"" was talented but only available inside Asia. ""T-Ara"" have talent and possibility of ""across the US border"" just like Shakira did a decade ago. Just watch this DVD and check up the YOUTUBE to see how T-Ara's doing. Then you will see what I mean.",1330905600,,645,4.863636363636363
