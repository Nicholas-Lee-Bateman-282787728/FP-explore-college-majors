5382392,1,B00A6HSWYI,I am sending the DVD back because I never could get it to play.  I was so looking forward to getting a good workout in.  I will order again and hope I just got a lemon.,1368403200,5,168,3.638888888888889
5382393,5,B00A6HSWYI,"He made it so easy to follow and learn. I love line dancing but always felt foolish trying to learn it in front of everyone. Now that i can learn in my own home at my own pace makes me feel confident in my abilities.
Thanks for all the hardwork guys and gals! cant wait for a new edition :)",1362355200,27,290,3.85
5382394,5,B00A6HSWYI,I bought this item recently and I use it with all of my friends and family. Order arrived very quickly and in great condition. The lessons are paced extremely well and it will help make anyone a better country line dancer. 5/5 stars,1362009600,28,232,4.4186046511627906
5382395,5,B00A6HSWYI,"I am a new country dancing addict and and the first time or two that I went, I was always envious of the fun line dances that the other guys and gals were doing. They looked fun and I wanted to participate! I jumped in and tryed to learn the steps as I went, which is basically impossible. So, I got these DVDs, both the line dancing and the swing dancing, and now it is a lot easier to keep up with the other people doing the line dances. The video is really clear and easy to follow and made me want to put on a pair of boots and go again!",1361577600,25,541,3.8392857142857144
5382396,5,B00A6HSWYI,"This line dance DVD is great.  If you want to learn a good variety of dances I think this is a good way to go.  I definitely feel like I got my moneys worth.  The line dance instruction was good.  For me personally I probably would have had them go a little slower, but it was a great pace for my wife.  I do understand that they accommodated for this with the whole thing of making each section of steps a chapter in the dvd so i could skip back and do those steps over again, and I actually used it, but my wife was usually ready to move on before I was, so I just thought I would mention it... The thing I liked the most is that you get to practice the dances.  Doing all of them back to back at the end of the DVD is really fun.",1360627200,49,732,3.814569536423841

5382429,2,B00A6HSWYI,"I didn't expect so many advanced moves.  It's designed more for the young people, not the middle aged.  We can't kick our heels and bend our knees like that.  So, needless to say, I was disappointed.",1506124800,2,199,4.472222222222222

5382459,5,B00A6HSWYI,"Yes, seniors can do boot scooting. The first item on the dvd was make sure and check with your physician before trying these dance steps. The reason I gave this 5* is because I can no longer really dance like I used to. Each dance step is explained several times with the video showing how to do it. Western dance is several different steps for line dancing. After two days I am very good at one part. So when I visit my old friends I can go and dance. There is lots of twirling and spinning, but you need not do that part.  You can play one part several times over to learn that specific part and then it continues to include another step. After watching this, if I miss, I can just tap my boots and clap and go yee-haw.",1493337600,7,721,4.113475177304965

5382462,1,B00A6HSWYI,"This dvd does a demonstration of the steps for each line dance and then does a practice of each one after.  By the time you get through doing the steps for each line dance you've forgotten the steps for the first one and just get frustrated when they start the practice of each line dance.  Why not show the steps, do practice of that line dance, and then move to the next one?  People in general are more motivated if they feel like they are accomplishing something than if they are left feeling frustrated.  The way this dvd is set up makes it boring and tedious in my opinion.",1490918400,6,579,4.284403669724771
5382463,4,B00A6HSWYI,"My husband and I are learning as we know 2 dances, Cupid Shuffle & the Ole. We haven't opened this one to watch yet. What I'm concerned about is that one of the DVD's is loose inside the packaged dvd box so my hope is that it's not going to be skipping & all from possible scratches. Otherwise, once we watch it, we'll update regarding the instructors & whether they're fun to learn from, thanks.",1489276800,,396,4.293333333333333
5382464,2,B00A6HSWYI,"If you have other dance experience, this is great. But if you're really a beginner, it goes way too fast.

5382474,5,B00A6HSWYI,"To preface my experience level I take some aerobics classes (step and Zumba) on occasion and have a pretty decent sense of rhythm

This is a pretty good started video if you just want to pick up a few new line dances to have more fun when you go out.  Or the low impact aerobic practice session at the end of the dvd lasts about 30 minutes which is great to jazz up your exercise routine, although I wouldnt get it just for exercise.

There is a short tutorial at the beginning of disc one that gives you instructions on a few of the basic moves in country dancing before jumping into some actual dances.  I looked at this briefly but since I knew what the first few moves outlined were I just skipped it.

The actual explanations for the dances are brief and to the point but done in a way the sections are explained and the brought together step by step until the dance is complete.  There is then a chance to try to do it with the music for at least four turns or a complete circle.  If there is a step that takes you a little longer you can hit back a chapter to review it.  So for those people who pick up dances quickly it moves along well and for those that need a little more help they can review very easily.  For me they could have gone a little faster but for most that don't do any sort of aerobics it is probably spot on time wise.  But lets be honest if you have never done a grapevine or triple-step before it will take you some extra time to learn.  If you don't have rhythm this is not going to magically give you some.

I liked that these came with 2 DVDs and 20 dances total.  There are also the 2 different 30 minute low impact practice workouts at the ends of the DVDs that once you have learned the dances you can just go to for refreshers or fun.  During these sessions once you get more comfortable you will see some of the flare you could add to the dance.  I didn't try any of the flare moves until Id been through it a few times but they were fun to add in later.

You can actually view a few of the dances on YouTube that come straight from this video to see if you like the teaching style and if it works for you.  That is actually how I found this DVD.  The other thing I appreciate is that on the website you can find a list of songs that can be used with each style of dance so you can load your phone or iPod to have it on the go for fun or to create your own country dance workout routine which is what I was able to do after about a month. I like to do 15-20 minutes of cardio a few times a week at work and this is an easy fun way to get it in.",1481155200,42,2580,3.9383429672447012

They breakdown the steps first, then start to combine all the steps together a few at a time.  If they go too fast for your speed, then just simply rewind it a little.

8546976,3,B00A6HSWYI,"I bought this video because it claimed it was low impact.  It is NOT low impact.  In low impact, one foot remains on the ground at all times to prevent jarring of the back and joints.  I have worked my way through the dances on the first volume and about half of them require rapid hopping with both feet off the ground or a hop and kick at the same time.  Some of them can be adapted to keep one foot on the ground but not all.  In fact, in one, the dancer squats down and hits the floor before and behind which is really tough on bad backs. In others, the dancer must rapidly twist raised legs in order to slap ankles or even a slap beneath the raised leg.  It is good for people who do not require low impact:  each dance is gone over and well taught in short segments which can be easily replayed in order to learn the dance..",1514592000,,830,4.024390243902439

8546978,5,B00A6HSWYI,"Short, sweet & easy to follow! The Line Dance Lessons on DVD is fun and effective. Jared Moore does an excellent job at explaining basic moves which compromise a full dance. Once the basics are covered he builds upon them so that you're comfortable with the variety of moves. No matter your experience in dancing, this DVD is ideal for anyone and everyone. The camera angles are well done so it's super clear and easy to follow along. Personally, I've not been able to find a better product to learn country line dances from.",1507852800,,525,4.595744680851064
