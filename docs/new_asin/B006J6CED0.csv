4992647,4,B006J6CED0,I had already seen part of this dvd series before i purchased it but this was very educational for me,1361664000,,101,4.1
4992648,5,B006J6CED0,We bought this for our first grader because he is interested in history and presidents. The segments are short enough that we can watch 1-2 at a time and it gives him enough information without be overwhelming. My husband and I have enjoyed learning little known facts as well. Very well done series!!,1361664000,4,301,4.69811320754717
4992649,5,B006J6CED0,Watched this on PBS and was delighted to find it on DVD.  It shows the story of each presidency without any political agendas.  It is very interesting; my 10 yr old watched it by choice!,1361404800,,186,4.285714285714286
4992650,5,B006J6CED0,"I am really happy with this dvd set. The best part is my 8 and 11 year old girls also thinks it is really great.  Edward Herrmann narrated the series and did a wonderful job. He has a great voice for this type of work. With this set you get an eight-part survey of the lives and legacies of the Presidents. The series features rare and unseen photographs.  You hear the story of the Presidents from journalists, scholars, and politicians. Great investment if you homeschool!",1361232000,2,474,4.564705882352941
4992651,5,B006J6CED0,"I really like this series because it captures the essence of each president to the point.  As most of us should know, 7th or 8th graders have a very short attention span and this film is great because each segment (president) is about 15 to 20 minutes, just enough time before you lose them.",1358726400,15,291,4.388888888888889

4992654,4,B006J6CED0,A great streamlined version of biographies for every one of our presidents. I disagree with some of the analysis but thats what makes it fun.,1353542400,8,141,4.68
4992655,5,B006J6CED0,This is by far one of the best put together informative cover most of the basics and a few of the just for fun facts without getting overly toward one side or the other.

4992656,1,B006J6CED0,"This is a great and informative video regarding the presidents of the United States.
It starts with George Washington and ends with the current president.  The video reviews their personal lives and time in office, as well as their impact on U.S. History.  It also has a section about the wives of the presidents which was extremely interesting.  For anyone who is interested in learning about our presidents and their time in office - this is a great video - would recommend it!!",1350950400,15,480,4.759036144578313

4992663,4,B006J6CED0,"I'm a high school Government teacher, and these are quick, concise, efficient videos that sum up each President's time in office.  It's light on biographical information (which is fine with me).  Each President gets roughly 9-12 minutes, and it's all about ""here's what happened during his presidency, and here's his legacy"".

4992666,2,B006J6CED0,"SPOTTY. Amazingly-  they are  apologists  for  Herbert Hoover-  considered  one of  the  WORST  presidents  and  heavily criticize FDR-  considered one of  the  absolute  best. They  do  not  mention the  WPA, CCC or  the  accomplishments of getting  the  country through  the  Great  Depression. They have talking  heads explaining  how  Hoover  and  Harding were decent presidents and gloss  over  McKinley, an imperialist  who  presided  over  the taking  of  Hawaii  and the  Phillippines from the  native  people. They  are  better on the  modern  presidents-  Eisenhower,  JFK,  LBJ  and Nixon  are  done  well.",1423526400,,617,5.337078651685394

4992683,5,B006J6CED0,"There is no better ladder to hang history of the U. S. on than the terms of the nation's presidents.  This is no substitute for reading multiple books on history of the U. S., the ideas of its leading political thinkers, its wars, its economic changes...  This book offers the bare basics about each president, and some idea of the state of the nation encountered and acted on by each.  This is the kind of review that should be watched at least once a year, for refreshing who was when and what was going on.  Or, at least, that is my intention.",1402272000,,546,4.323529411764706
4992684,5,B006J6CED0,well I have enjoyed presidents till the being of school. i would love to become the president!! this is a amazing set :),1398988800,,120,4.260869565217392

4992690,4,B006J6CED0,"As a French I don't know much about US history, especially the period of the 19th century.

About US pr&eacute;sidents, my knowledge was limited to what I couls understand in the attraction ""Hall of Pr&eacute;sidents"" in the Disney'S Magic Kingdom Park in walt Disney World.

So imagine what I learned about fully unknown Chief exexutives of the USA, by myself obviously,  by watching these documentaries.

The long bonus on First Ladies is particularly interesting, and complete the National Geographic booklet on the subject I bought after visiting the White House in August 1998.

The only thing I regret personnally is that I ordered the dvd when watching that it was closed captioned. But actually it is not.  It's written on the cover and Amazon is not responsible, for reporting it on its description.

It's why I give a four stars rating instead of a five.

History Channel must be more cautious with what they write on the description of their products.

Apart of this problem, I recommend all foreigners to buy this cheap TV serie, very interesting to learn about US history.",1391731200,,1085,4.917582417582418
4992691,5,B006J6CED0,"Watching this is much easier for me than readying bios on all the presidents.  I wouldn't use this as a sole source of info as it does seem a little biased, but that's to be expected in political matters I guess.",1391385600,,212,4.170731707317073
4992692,5,B006J6CED0,Segments are fun and short to kick off class discussions. Students are easily focused and absorb information about important events very quickly.,1391299200,,145,5.636363636363637
4992693,5,B006J6CED0,This was informative as well as entertaining and brought history alive with some interesting and little known facts.  If history had been taught this way in school more people would have listened.,1390003200,,196,5.125
4992694,3,B006J6CED0,"This is a chronological history of the US presidents from the original George W. up to George W. Bush's 2004 re-election.  Each episode features about 5 or 6 mini-biographies and a summary of each president's time in office (very little of his time before or after the presidency).  In nearly every case, the producers try to show some positive as well as some negative of each, creating a relatively balanced portrait in most cases.

Beginning with Nixon, however, a left-wing bias becomes rather obvious.  Of course, fair evaluation of Nixon's schizoid presidency (spectacular achievements as well as monumental failures) is a tricky act, and must end on a negative note because of how the presidency itself ended.  Thus, reviews of Nixon are almost always harsh, and perhaps rightly so.  Nonetheless, this depiction seems to be harsher than most.  The brief Ford interlude gets somewhat of a pass, although there's the inevitable focus on Ford's physical clumsiness at the expense of his efforts to heal the nation after Watergate.  The producers then write a love letter to Jimmy Carter, completely overlooking his penchant for micromanagement and how he was totally outclassed in the presidency, before moving onto Ronald Reagan.  Reagan is *twice* introduced as a ""former movie actor.""  Fair enough -- but there is NO mention of the fact that he was a moderately successful 2-term governor of the nation's largest state during a difficult time prior to the presidency (even Jimmy Carter is recognized as the former 1-term governor of a small southern state).

Bush Sr. is treated basically as Reagan's third term, and the treatment of Clinton, while somewhat fawning, is moderately fair in and of itself; however, the storyline casts Newt Gingrich and the 1994 Republicans as the villains against Slick Willie in Shining Armor, and proclaims -- apparently with a straight face -- that it was Clinton (who previously had shown no interest in a balanced budget, not even campaigning on it) who forced the Republicans to compromise, not the other way around.  Finally, we end with Bush the Younger, who is introduced as a ""former prep-school cheerleader who went to Yale.""  Yes, really.

But that's not all -- there's a 90-minute special on the first ladies.  One would think that this would at least rise above politics and show how that office has evolved.  One can, in fact, make the case that the office of First Lady, unencumbered as it is by any Constitutional prescriptions, has evolved at an even more aggressive pace than the presidency itself.  Sadly, the majority of the ""documentation"" in this production is provided by a series of liberal female college professors who hold forth their icons of Jackie Kennedy and Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton, holding every other first lady before or since against this gold standard and finding all of them wanting.  Even Roslyn Carter -- ROSLYN CARTER -- is exalted over nearly everyone else.  Pat Nixon and Nancy Reagan are (predictably, by this point) given a particularly heavy-handed treatment.  This is rather sad in Pat Nixon's case, as she, unlike Nancy, never sought the limelight or a high-profile position in her husband's administration, yet she repeatedly is treated harshly by historians.  As for Nancy, the producers have utterly no shame in visually contrasting the 60ish Reagan with the 30ish Jackie, a technique that is almost criminal.

Needless to say, I have not yet embarked upon the final disc -- an A&E Biography of Barack Obama.  Given the gaps in the incumbent's biography (starting, some would say, with his birth itself), I am hesitant to see how a production team from the same network will creatively adapt his sketchy story, but have very little doubt what their conclusions will be.  His rise to power, nonetheless, is a story worth telling, but it is obviously premature (from a fairness perspective, at least) to gauge the success or failure of his administration.

All in all, a moderately good synopsis of the presidency, but a disappointment at the end.",1388793600,26,4050,5.045045045045045
4992695,5,B006J6CED0,My hubby is really into politics and political history. This DVD is educational as well as fun to watch. It has information on of the presidents and is presented in an unbiased way. I feel that it would be a great tool in a classroom setting. The segments are informational but not too long.,1388188800,,291,4.407407407407407
4992696,5,B006J6CED0,Very Very interesting. A lot of small tidbits we didn't know about each President. Are Senior group discusses each president after each segment.,1386288000,,144,5.304347826086956

4992700,5,B006J6CED0,This is a very educational film. I've watched it once and will probably watch it again. I love history and this provides me with information I did not know before. It helps you get the history of our presidents' failures and their successes. Interesting that some of us feel some of our presidents were failures but as time goes by we do see them in a different light and our opinion of their presidency can well change. Excellent DVD.,1379289600,,435,4.518987341772152
4992701,5,B006J6CED0,"This video is one of the best developed and easy to follow.  It covers all the basic information without getting bogged down into too much info.  It also gives a lot of ""fun facts"" which my kids (teens) love.",1375747200,,208,4.3076923076923075
4992702,5,B006J6CED0,This is a good selection and review of the highlights of our U.S. Presidents. A good - and this IS good - visual presentation always complements one's literary exploration of history. Very enjoyable.  -Ted,1374019200,,205,5.029411764705882

Imagine my surprise and dissapoinment to find 2 number 4 discs as part of this order while disc number 1 is ""MIA"". So now I am debating ordering it again.",1371945600,3,417,3.86046511627907

Jefferson,Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt are the next three highly rated presidents.",1361836800,4,400,5.1692307692307695

8499173,5,B006J6CED0,"I saw this documentary on the History channel and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I wasn't a history buff growing up but with time (or age) you want to learn why things happen the way they did.  It's enough information to keep even the less interested viewer captivated (IMO).  Buyer's beware, since our recent election, the price has greatly increased.",1478649600,,345,4.913793103448276
8499174,1,B006J6CED0,"This would have been a very good series to learn interesting bits about our presidents, most that I'm sure you never learned in school, except for the left-leaning bias that grew exponentially, especially once the Lincoln presidency was discussed (and I got the impression they hated that Lincoln was a Republican!). The First Ladies section at the end was absolutely sickening. You would think no Republican First Lady ever did a single thing of any worth at all-- once they finally began to discuss a few of them, they were put in the worst light possible. Truly a travesty that got so bad, I simply could not watch the last 10 minutes. There was no way they were going to be able to redeem themselves for such an attack on First Ladies in the last 10 minutes.

For the record, I do not vote a political party. I vote for who I think is the best qualified no matter the party.  The producers used every attempt to portray the Democrat Presidents in the very best light possible by omitting and skimming over important events that made those presidents look bad, while digging deep into every misstep any Republican president ever made. I began to wonder just how much of the information on the presidents I didn't know much about were presented fairly and honestly, since what I did know was borderline at best. In the end, I suspect this is more a ""fluff"" piece than true information.

My overall feeling about this series is that it's very disappointing. If you are looking for a fair, honest and truthful assessment and presentation of all of OUR Presidents and OUR First Ladies, I really suggest you look elsewhere.",1466726400,2,1621,4.660839160839161
