Once again, another movie that won't allow cultures and races to just work and get along without jumping the barrier into mixed relationships.",1302048000,,244,4.833333333333333
8265759,3,B0017GF5R4,"The music in this movie was excellent.  The music was both technically and artistically excellent.

As a movie though it was a simplistic rendition of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, which they do not hide, as the protagonists names were Romeo and Juliet.  Moderately fun to watch especially from the cultural perspective of a non-Roma and non-Serb.

I had no problem viewing it since I own a region-free and PAL-NTSC capable DVD player.

The English subtitles were large to the point of being distracting at times.  They were necessary as I don't understand Serbian.",1267574400,,567,5.043010752688172
