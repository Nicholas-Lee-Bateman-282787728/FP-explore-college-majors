The guy puking in the toilet is obviously fake, but not needed in this video, and the 2 guys dressed up in things and riding dirt bikes is completely uncalled for, there is nothing in this video that pertained to that stupidity.
That is stuff you find on Youtube.....

Even for [...] bucks you pay for a 30 minute video, you can do the same and get a Crusty Demons DVD or Huevos DVD and have at least an hour of originality!!

Dont waste your time with this DVD...",1289520000,,674,4.291338582677166

8113389,2,B000EQH27E,"I shouldn't have expected much for 5.99, but I was at least expecting to see some good endos.  I did get that, there are some pretty nasty spills where you can't help go ""Oh man, that's gotta hurt..."".

There are also some really evil crashes where the guys are trying to do some freestyle... So yes, there are some good things in this DVD...

But then about 15-20 minutes into it, there is a stupid sequence where a man and woman in some S&M leather are riding around half naked (no there is no real nudity) cracking whips and stuff... it isn't funny, it does not fit, and if you were watching with your kids you would be shocked.  Not to mention that a minute later there is a guy puking into a toilet???  I'm not sure what the makers of this thought.  They didn't have to add this trash in the middle.

I would have given this 3 stars if they had just added 5 more minutes of crashing to replace the unnecessary vulgarity.  Oh, and you have to pretty much like thrash metal as well because that is the soundtrack.

Chances are I will sell this and hope to get half my money back.",1152230400,6,1082,4.213592233009709
