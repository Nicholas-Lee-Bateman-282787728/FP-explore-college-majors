3653977,1,B001JAHSHI,WOW What happened with the price. It's is about double the price of season 15 blu-ray.  This is a enormous jump in price. I'm doing a protest no purchase till it is significantly reduced.,1383436800,7,187,4.5
3653978,5,B001JAHSHI,"This is obviously being reviewed before the product has been released, so I can't at this time comment on Easter Eggs, extras, or anything of that nature.  My only real complaint is that we only as of recent gets these once a year.  Usually, around Christmas time, so the December 3rd release is pretty on par with that.  Below are the highlighted episodes in my opinion.

Of course we have a Treehouse of Horror to open the season.

All's Fair in Oven War--A very fun Marge episode, and the B story of Bart and Milhouse following Playboy lifestyle after Marge forces Homer to cut out all the models since the magazines have cultural value.

Sleeping with the Enemy--A touching Nelson story where he and Bart become best friends.

Midnight RX--A hysterically funny story of Homer and Grandpa smuggling prescription drugs to Springfield from Canada.

There's Something About Marrying--Homer becomes an ordained Minister when Springfield legalizes gay marriage.

Goo Goo Gai Pan--Another international story, this time landing the family in China after a scheme of Selma's goes too far.

Thank God It's Doomsday--A funny and touching story as Homer tries to predict the end of the world.

The Father, The Son, and the Holy Guest Star--After being expelled from school again, Bart finds himself in Catholic school, which ends up being an adventure for everyone.

Season 16 isn't bad, it still has episodes that make you laugh out loud, as well as tug at your heart.  This is the era of the Simpsons where the B Story is often more funny than the main plot line.",1382572800,11,1558,4.833962264150943
3653979,5,B001JAHSHI,"I have to tell you, 10 years ago I was a huge Simpsons fan. Now that it is 2013 and we are still 9 seasons behind and I have 15 seasons to spin up and watch anytime I want, I think I am done buying them - especially for $40. Releasing them one a year was a financial error and frustrated your fans all at the same time. Life is short and there are better books to read and shows to watch.",1378944000,14,388,3.7439024390243905
3653980,5,B001JAHSHI,"it has been almost a year since the release of season 15 of the simpsons on dvd. it used to be every 6 months now its longer than a year till the next season comes out n dvd. please release season 16 soon. also, please go back to the head format like seasons 6 through 10 whee eah disc has its own disc tray. seasons 11-15 do not have disc trays instead the dvds slide into cardboard slots which makes the dvds scratch like crazy. my season 11-15 discs are way more scratched than my seasons 6-10 which are still in mint condition. in most cases the season 11-15 discs were already all scratched up when i purchased them. please go back to the early head packaging. cheers, james",1378598400,5,679,4.271317829457364
3653981,5,B001JAHSHI,"I rarely look forward to anything, much less put actual money aside for something. This is killing me - you must release season 16 on DVD! Why do you choose to torture us like this? What could be the motivation of your terrible choice of not sharing season 16 with your buddies? I mean, I'm totally willing to pay money, you know? Isn't that kind of the goal when you release a product - to make money?

My god, man. I've never gotten on my knees before, but just say the word, JUST SAY THE WORD!",1377475200,19,496,4.166666666666667
3653982,5,B001JAHSHI,"You were producing these seasonal DVD sets every 6 months. Now it has been an entire year since season 15 without so much as a pre-order yet. It looks like you have done nothing to produce the DVD's for the remaining seasons. Where is season 16? In fact, I would like to have all of the remaining seasons... except 20, of course. There are those of us who are still buying these simpson season episode sets on DVD. If you are losing customers it is because they are dying of old age or ailments before you produced the DVD's. If you haven't noticed, large numbers of people are dying in their 50's now. The longer you wait, the more customers will die. You had better hurry up while there are any of us left to buy them. Your audience will only dwindle with time...

At the very least... do all 24 years worth of ""Treehouse of Horror"" since those are clearly the best episodes. I had to put all 15 years worth of Treehouse episodes in separate Jewel cases so I can access them without having to open 15 DVD sets to find them. So it would be nice to have all of these on a separate DVD set so I can return the other 15 DVD's to their original season set packages. You did it in VHS back when there were only 3 seasons of Treehouse to show.

Get into gear and get these produced while you still have customers.",1376352000,37,1308,4.207171314741036

3654249,5,B001JAHSHI,"Now fully out of their early-noughties rut the Simpsons is back on the up, up, up in this hilarious 16th season. The writing, satire, and general madness is sharp, the characters are all lovable (apart from Grandpa, who is thankfully downplayed in this season), and the guest stars are as varied as ever with Jason Bateman, Liam Neeson, and Stephen Hawking (now becoming a semi-regular) getting in on the action.

A couple of episodes can't find their way and don't know which plot thread to follow but it's my only complaint. The Blu-ray features 3 bonus episodes, in HD, featuring flash-forward stories set in the ""future"".

3654255,1,B001JAHSHI,"It is with great sadness that I pen this review. I hate to say anything bad about a show which for DECADES now, has provided so much joy; laughter; and entertainment- a lone treasure from the cesspool that is Hollywood.

Of course, as with any show, some seasons are naturally better than others- but unfortunately, The Simpsons have hit rock-bottom with this season.

Some might say that after so many years, that the crew of people responsible for making this show have finally run out of ideas- but I do not believe that that is the case. Rather (and they even allude to this fact in the commentaries) I believe the problem is that this is one of the years in which they were devoting so much time to the making of the [awful!] Simpsons Movie, that they neglected the actual show. Why they would do such to such a successful show (or why they were allowed to do it!) is beyond me- but such a course of action was disastrous for the show, and I'd wager that it was also a very poor business decision.

Problem B: As had been the case in several preceding seasons, the producers seem to have fallen into a routine where they are more concerned with the plot of the episodes; and less concerned about the humor; wit; and amusing parody of/editorial on contemporary culture- which is a shame, because it was those things which once made the show so great.

They devote so much effort to ""telling a story"" - and subsequently then have to devote more time to resolving the details of that story- thus relegating the humor and witticisms to a subordinate position. They even admit that oftentimes, due to time constraints, jokes and the little flourishes that once made the show so great, must be cut or passed-over entirely, in order to use the available run-time to tell the story demanded by the plot; and to resolve the details of that story.

You would think that amongst such a cadre of intelligent people, as those who produce this show, that they could figure out that people do not watch cartoons for their plots/drama/meaningful stories!!! I'd imagine that I speak for many when I say that I personally watch The Simpsons for: A)The humor; B)The wit [The Simpsons was the ONE show which uniquely stood out as possessing intelligent and witty humor- as opposed to the vapid moronic nonsense which normally emanates from Hollywood] and C: All the little flourishes/observations/parodies which served as a commentary on/lampoon of/ridicule of contemporary American culture.

Sadly, all of those great traits mentioned above are now gone. It's as if the producers have stopped seeing themselves as comedians/cartoonists/entertainers, and instead now seem to operate under the modus operandi that they are making half-hour animated dramas- with maybe an occasional joke or two thrown in here and there.

Some people disparagingly refer to this season as one of the ""Al Jean years""- which is unfair- as, in my opinion, Al Jean is brilliant, and has played a major role in the long success of the Simpsons- having been a driving force behind the show virtually since it's inception- and should be commended for all the GOOD seasons which he had a major role in producing, in one capacity or another.

The Simpsons is clearly a big-team effort...but in this season, the ""team"" was obviously more concerned with making a movie; and relegated the series to a back burner- and it obviously shows. (And they really struck-out on that movie!)

It was glaringly evident how they took many ""shortcuts"" with this season: Virtually every episode contains at least one music montage. -Now I can enjoy a well-placed music montage, when it is appropriate and relevant and well-done....but when one starts appearing in every episode, it is evident that it is just being used as a vehicle to fill time while requiring the least input.

Also, the great touches which made earlier seasons so great, were noticeably absent here- i.e the little flashbacks/flash-forwards/thought balloons/non-sequiturs; etc. No, instead, we get little animated soap-operas now.

I had high hopes for this season, as I read it's description and reviews, because I love it when they explore secondary characters- like Patty and Selma; Skinner; Flanders; etc. and even devote entire episodes to them- which they indeed do in this season- but unfortunately, even that couldn't save this season, as even those episodes were poorly done; and again, were centered around setting up a dramatic plot, and then resolving it- thus pushing out all the other traits which formerly made the show so great.

After watching the episodes and commentaries of this season once, I sold my season 16 DVD set. Nothing worth keeping here. I never thought I'd have to do that to a Simpsons DVD set.

Kudos for the commentaries on every episode, though. As usual, the commentaries were very enjoyable- only this time, they were much more enjoyable than the actual episodes.

Bottom line: If you're looking the wit; humor; and observations/parodies/references that the masses don't ""get""/etc. which once made this show so great...you're not going to find them in this season. :(",1399507200,9,5115,4.911935110081113
3654256,5,B001JAHSHI,"""The Simspons"" continues to go strong, and season 16 is no exception.  It's only natural for a show to change over the years... and decades... but change isn't necessarily a bad thing.  With such an enormous cast of characters to draw from, season 16 continues to entertain with stories that are both insanely funny, hilariously irreverent, and, at times, deeply heartfelt and touching.",1398211200,2,386,5.111111111111111

It's great that the people who've worked on the show for years have been pinning for this for a while, hopefully adding more DVD features, extras, and commentary that can beat digital download service, despite probably being the dominant medium in the entertainment market.

What I'm hoping for is the box set to not be in sleeves, as they have made minor scratches and more, which frustrates me. I guess that's the great thing about going digital, but you don't own a physical copy per se. Still, great to see it coming back.

As for Season 16, I recall still liking it in my teen years, as despite what I read on the forums and Slashdot when it was big, I still liked the humor and cultural references.
