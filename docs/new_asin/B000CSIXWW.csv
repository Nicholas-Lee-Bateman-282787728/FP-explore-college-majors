8101802,5,B000CSIXWW,"A wonderful biography on actress Sharon Tate. Rare film clips and interviews with family and friends. Does not dwell on the horrible murder, a look at her entire (but short) life and career. Everyone loved and respected her, beautiful inside and out. One of the biggest tragedies in Hollywood history.",1152835200,10,301,5.04
