Buffy and Angels ;ove tyed them together and keeps them apart and in the end they  both end getting hurt. There relationship makes me want to cry. Oh yeah for  all ya Buffy fans out there the best Buffy/Angel episode(The one where he  turned human) comes on next week. Guarenteed to bring tears.

1259374,3,B000035Z1M,"I would've gave this tape a full five stars if there wasn't something that bothered me in the two episodes featured on it.  The thing that bothered me was the ridiculous sub-plot of the 'Judge.'  These episodes didn't need it.  These would've been better if they held more substance on the Buffy/Angel  relationship.
What is even more annoying is Xander inflitrating a  military base to obtain a weapon to kill the Judge.  The creators get  around this by saying that Xander can do it as he remembers the layout  and  protocol for the base from the Halloween episode in which he turns into a  soldier.  One question, if he can remember all that, why can't he remember  to fight like a soldier instead of getting his butt kicked all the  time?
Overall though, these two episodes are good and they're both  wrapped up neatly with the end scene.  You'll see what I mean...
All  Buffy fans should buy this tape but if you're not, the whole 'judge'  subplot might not be some people's cup of tea.  I say this as there's a lot  more Buffy episodes available to buy that are ten times better than these  featured here!",957225600,2,1111,4.515151515151516

The Angel and Buffy Chronicles tell me a little about Angel and Buffy's history.  The Becoming is one of the best episodes  I've seen.

1259379,5,B000035Z1M,"This video shows the two episodes ""Surprise"" & ""Innocence"". In the first, it's Buffy's 17th birthday, when Angel gives Buffy her claddagh ring and they have sex for the first time. In  ""Innocence"", we see the effects of this as Angel reverts to the  dark side and snubs Buffy, who is understandably devestated. However, she  and her friends still manage to vanquish the Judge, brough forth by Spike  & Drusilla, to destroy the world.",948672000,5,433,4.8108108108108105

1259426,4,B000035Z1M,"I think this is the first season where Joss Whedon took a step back and let some other writers and directors take the reigns.  In a nutshell, the season follows Buffy's adventures into the college world and what the other Scoobies will do now that high school is over.  Not a very memorable season though for standard Buffy fans though.

However it does have one saving grace - HUSH, hands down one of the best episodes in all of TV and clearly Joss's best work.  Watch it and enjoy.",1460764800,,483,4.393258426966292

1259444,4,B000035Z1M,"The show has grown up from the previous three seasons. While I might let a younger person (a tween) watch the first season, this fourth season really has become a lot more oriented toward someone who is older. I can't say that I fully approved of the episode showing Buffy getting sloppy drunk (and then turning into some weird, ape-like, creature). Some of the shows are quite fun and a few made me laugh. However, the fare has become decidedly more adult with constant depictions of sexual scenes. It's a bit over the top.",1457308800,,524,4.585106382978723

1259478,3,B000035Z1M,"This show is five stars. Riley is - 3.  I added one of the stars back because Spike is the greatest comic relief character EVER (and I'm including Sokka from Avatar in that list).  This show is just campy and good, with lots of humor, and deep angst all around.  This season has the groundbreaking episode ""Hush"", which the shows producers added to prove that Buffy is not all witty dialogue and in fact can stand on it's two feet without any dialogue at all. Riley takes this entire season down a notch.  He was such a flat, 2-dimensional, overly-macho character that it's amazing anyone could fall for him.  He practically had a halo and wings attached to his perfect Gary Stu self the entire time.  He was absolutely boring, with no personality and aside from being a generic love interest for the main character brought nothing to the show.",1448323200,,844,4.593333333333334

I can't watch the episode with the weird cheese man because it didn't come without a commentary.  And of course, I can't return it because it is past the window.

I also experienced a much higher than normal amount of pixelation and stoppage than any other series I've been watching so far on Amazon Prime.

It is also the high point of the ""Scooby Gang"" and mixes a sense of camaraderie and comedy with the emerging relationship conflicts and identity crises to follow. It is, in short, the end of innocence. I maintain that Buffy has some of the finest overall story architecture of any series on TV -- everything seems to cohere, set-ups always pay-off, and whether it was happy accident or visionary foresight, all the pieces of character growth and fulfillment play out rewardingly. Season 4 fits snugly in the middle. I also think Riley Finn is the natural boyfriend for Buffy at this moment in her development -- the simple straight-shooter who it turns out, in other example of the series' generosity and depth, has his own inner demons. I return to Season Four now and then with great affection, fun and with a sense of poignance for what was and could not be again.",1438214400,,1001,4.597765363128492

1259595,3,B000035Z1M,"Well this season was wrong on so many levels. It started when they introduced the Initiative. They started off strong but then they went downhill fast. Riley and Buffys relationship is rather bi-polar, okay one minute then they are arguing and Riley is apologizing for something that wasn't his fault. And Oz left! :( that made me mad! He was one of the best sometimes characters in the series! But the emotional scene with Willow made me cry (both times!). The character developments were non existent in this season and what's with starting off the season with watching Buffy go to class and half way through all of a sudden there are to many monsters for her to go to class?!?! And what's up with Angel being MORE whiny and obnoxious then ever when he's there? Thats VERY ANNOYING.
Well the things I DID like were few, Giles knowing the guitar and (if that's actually him singing) he doesn't have to bad of a voice! And then the Tara and Willow thing, I'm glad they mixed things up! BBBBUUUUUTTTTTT..........NOT WITH TARA! It seems that everyone walks all over Tara, the writers write her in like she's a shy doormat.

She goes through self-doubt, bad choice dates, all kinds of stuff that normal women go through.  Of course, there is a lot of fighting, killing, and super witty dialog, a trademark of this show.  But two of the best episodes of the series are in this season.  'Hush' and 'Primeval'.  I know 'Hush' won some awards, and I love it too.

1259683,5,B000035Z1M,"Season-Four of Buffy is a time of transition.  Buffy, Willow and Oz all transition from high school into college.  Xander transitions from being a dateless nerd, to dating a 1,020 year-old former demon.  Spike is transformed from being a blood-sucking killer of humans into a vampire whos incapable of biting (or even hitting) humans.  And although it sounds clich, Willow (who had seemed to be very heterosexual in seasons 1-3) transitions into a lesbian relationship during her first year in college.

Dramatic character changes like this could have been handled very badly and seemed forced and awkward, but Joss Whedon and his creative team pulled all of this off in such a way that it didn't feel awkward at all.

Spike is amusing as an undead anti-hero.  Willow and Tara are charming as a teenage lesbian couple.  Xander and Anya (who were social misfits on their own) actually seem to function well as a couple.

Buffy of course is still the Slayer and still a dangerous predator that can slay vampires and demons, and still look stylish while doing it.

Special praise goes to Hush, an episode which proved that humans don't need verbal communication to communicate and to Doomed an episode which showed that just because Spike couldn't kill humans didn't mean he couldn't be a predator anymore.  His transformation into an anti-hero who killed demons (and vampires and other nocturnal threats) was easily the most amusing part of the episode.",1414195200,2,1451,4.954545454545454

1259731,4,B000035Z1M,"So normally I do my reviews the same day or night that I finish the season, this one took me a few days... and here's why...
I really was at a mixture of feelings about this season, I wish I could only give this a ***1/2 instead of ****, so I just give it whatever I would say it's closer to, the problem with this season for me are the changes, some good, many bad. While I feel that there are some strong episodes, there are three HORRIBLE ones, which is the BIGGEST problem with the season, like the episode Bad Beer and the Where the Wild Things Are episode in which Buffy literally (with the exception of the very opening) spends nearly ALL the episode having sex in a bedroom with Riley because of a possessed house that makes people ""get turned on"" basically, and Bad Beer has drunk Buffy (BADLY acted) turn into a *SPOILER* Caveman, or Cavegirl. This season gets into lesbianism, is VERY sexual, onscreen sex, and much more graphic violence and satanism, which is NOT what this show was about this badly in the previous three seasons like it is in this season. As much as I ragged on this season, it is very good with some excellent episodes, So, is this season worth a look? Yeah, I mean, if you've seen the previous three and do like the show as I do, but it doesn't inspire hope for the next season.

My favorite episodes of season 4 are:

Restless
Wild at Heart
Pangs
Hush
Fear Itself

Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 4 ***1/2 out of *****

Violent Content: 5/10 - Strong Action/Horror Violence, Bloody Violence and Sequences of Gore, and Gruesome/Disturbing Imagery.

Sexuality/Nudity: 4/10 - Some Strong Sexual Content, Suggestive Dialog and Innuendo.",1405036800,,1666,4.558528428093646
1259732,5,B000035Z1M,"Buffy is one of my favorite shows of all time.  Definitely have to watch before delving into any Angel (spin-off) episodes.  Some story-lines could be construed as ""disturbing"" but you're watching a show about vampires and demons, so....

I fell in love with the plot and the characters. They're good actors, they're hot, and the characters themselves are dynamic.

1259855,4,B000035Z1M,"Out of all the Buffy the Vampire Slayer seasons, season 4 tends to be the most infamous of the bunch. With that in mind, one may be a little worried to start this DVD set. My advice? Just watch and enjoy it. While this season is a bit cluddered with errors, it is better than average television and I would highly reccomend it to any fan of the show.

Season 4 begins with Buffy, Willow, and Oz starting their college careers and Xander, not in college and living in his mom's basement, and Giles, now retired, wondering where their lives are going. We now see more of Anya, Xander's new girlfriend who once a demon, and Spike becomes a main character after being neutered of his bad vampire powers. While we do not get to learn much about Anya, despite that she enertaining and a little psychotic, Spike is a wonderful addition to the main cast. When he is on screen with his blunt and funny dialogue and aggravating behavior you cannot help but love him. Two new love interests are brought into the show, Riley and the beautiful Tara. Riley is Buffy's new boyfriend who just happens to have a double life of his own. While he came off as ok in the earlier episodes, he is a very boring and uninteresting character. I do not think I can say one thing mentionable or unique about his personality. Tara becomes Willow's new lesbian love partner. She also studies witchcraft and is timid, making Willow the leader of their relationship. While I do not dislike Tara's character, I feel like she is just an expansion of the ever growing Willow and I have hopes her personality will expand in the next seasons. What about Oz, Willow's boyfriend, you ask? He has to leave town because of his werewolf troubles. This is disappointing because he was one of the show's coolest and most loved, by me at least, characters.

Plot wise? While I enjoy the new college setting and found it refreshing compared to the high school, this season was extremely lacking on the supernatural side of things. The main plot involves The Initiative, which seriously ends of being one of the government organizations things ever. They do experiments on supernatural creatures and have a secret plan of combining demons and people to create super-soldiers. It is up to Buffy and the gang to get rid of this underground organization together! While being a different and potentially interesting idea, it really falls flat and failed to engage me and take it seriously. The main super-soldier villain in the organization, Adam, was laughable. My mom watched a few episodes with me and she could not stop laughing at his voice and speeches.

My final complaint with this season is that the episodes start to reach the low that Season 1 was. The show had overcome this such a long time ago but here they are again. Episodes like Where the Wild Things Are and Beer Bad are just dreadful and as bad as you heard before watching them. A few other episodes clunk around and failed to keep my attention. Thankfully, there were a handful of classics and highlights along the way! Fear, Itself, Something Blue, Hush, Who Are You?, and Restless are all Buffy at the top of it's game. These are some of the most creative and entertaining episodes yet. Not to mention, this is a really funny season as well. You are bound to chuckle a few times during the episodes.

In conclusion, while Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 4 made some glaring mistakes, it was an overall enertaining season with some classic episodes. I am extremely started to start watching Season 5, what is known to be a fan favorite.",1378339200,,3560,4.628164556962025

Spike becomes a kind of house cat, a pitiful vampire, but his story is hilarious when looking in on it. Things do change in this season, but it has become addicting. You'll want to watch one right after the other now. You'll fall in love with this show all over again.

1259912,5,B000035Z1M,"This is another great season for this show, and it leaves us with the promise of exciting things to come. As we go through the season we get a little bit of everything, complex plots involving the Initiative, character development, especially in what has to do with Willow, awesome fight scenes and creative challenges. Then we get to the last episode, ""Restless"", and as this episode starts, we are pretty much lost as to what is going on. But then, everything starts to make sense, and we are left with the beginning of a discovery that is full of possibilities.

I am one of those people that never watched this show when it was first aired, and only discovered it recently. Since then, I have been watching episodes like crazy season after season. On the one hand I feel like I should not have missed participating in the experience when others were watching this great show, but on the other, I don't have to wait for more episodes to be released :)

The bottom line is that this season is great, as were the previous ones, and it provides the level of entertainment that fans of the series are used to. I am really looking forward to seeing what else is in store with this series.

You can actually see what she is going through, and she usually does what is best for everyone else even though it isn't what is best for her. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not your typical Vampire, Love Struck series, but has it the old fashioned way: have to be asked to come in, burn alive in sunlight, crosses, holy water, stake to the heart, etc. THIS is another reason why it is so great, because it isn't the glittery vampire crap everyone is into today.  You will never guess the outcome of this season, because you can't guess what is going to happen.

However, if you look at the season as a whole I felt the overarching story was probably one of the worst.  The Riley and Buffy thing didn't feel natural, and Adam was like that creepy uncle that everybody talks about but never sees. Making people that are new to the family believe the uncle is some mythical creature that really doesn't exist.  I mean he is one of the main antagonists for the season and he didn't even make the cover art.  Instead you have a monster that was only in one episode.",1365465600,,641,4.444444444444445

The season box is in good condition and the first three episodes were completely watchable on my ps3 without any issues.  From episode 4 on, there were skipping issues that were hard to work around.  My ps3 still won't play those episodes correctly, but my computer (a bit of a beast) is able to read them without any issues.  It's possible the ps3 needs a tune up, but at least the episodes are watchable so far (up to ep 7 now, I think) on the computer.

1259995,2,B000035Z1M,"This was the season that made me completely lose interest. There wasn't as much mystery to be found inside the characters. They were so familiar that it was boring and Buffy herself hadn't grown. They sailed through college issues without much real struggle. Of course we always know she can punch a demon and that fixes everything. They tried to introduce a new love for Buffy, Riley, but he just doesn't cut it. With Angel and Cordelia on a different show Buffy became almost unwatchable at times. Add in the boring military plotline which undercuts the supernatural tone of the show, and you have a big problem. Skipping ahead I see that Riley is in the show for a long time and thats too many episodes for me. This season has many comical episodes where spells make them appear out of character. When comical episodes appeared in the X-files it went downhill shortly after. Same with Buffy. Even though they are pretty funny, like Spike stuck in Giles apartment, its just not good enough.  I've watched almost every episode and most of season 4, but I just can't anymore. The magic is gone this season. I did start watching Angel, but its obvious that show starts to suffer similar problems. I don't think Joss Whedon can manage a long storyline. Skip Season four and find a different series to watch that wasn't made by Joss Whedon. I bet he'll never be back in TV again anyways.",1359590400,,1384,4.626016260162602

Yes, in the past Xander tried to mix in humor, however, the new mix of humor from the rest of the crowd is making this season a lot better. Spike getting jacked about killing demons along side Buffy and her cohorts is interesting and funny. Another great episode. I hope it stays like this. The humor, at least.

In Season 4, Buffy begins her spiral into promiscuousness, despite lamp-shading it, Whedon turns Willow into a lesbian for ratings, Xander is as weak as ever and Buffy's new love interest is a boneheaded frat guy.  New supporting characters are forgettable as well.

With the departure of David Boreanaz as ""Angel"", the show crashes and burns for me here.  There's no one left for me to relate to.  Season 4 is like watching your ex after you break up.  You can look in occasionally on them, but you won't like what you see.

The original high school setting never bothered me too much, but the college environment is just plain douchey and there's no other way to spin it.

I understand Joss is a feminist and that's all well and good, but it was never shoved in your face during the first three seasons and considering what the show is at its core (a super-powered girl fighting evil) it took damned good writing to hook the men in the audience.  I guess they thought the guys would stick around just to look at the pretty actresses.

With no strong male characters left, the show degrades into feminist hyperbole and despite all the demon head-bashing, it's about as exciting as actually watching teenage girls go to college.

Skip it and watch Angel Season 1.  Even at its worst, Angel's spin-off series never gets this bad or immature.",1340755200,4,1513,4.600746268656716

Buffy's first year in college has a weak overall protagonist and a number of flat episodes. Also, I'm pretty much alone in this, but I can't stand the new character of Tara.

Still, there are a number of quality episodes, and from here on out, the show gets more cinematic in style than ever.

Best episodes: Hush (one of the all-time best); Fear Itself; Something Blue; This Year's Girl / Who are You; Superstar; and Restless.",1331424000,,531,4.760869565217392
1260007,4,B000035Z1M,"To be honest, I didn't fall in love with this season of BtVS. It's a very good season but storylines and characterizations are not at their brightest. I don't love The Initiaive or Adam they're all very science fiction and with the addition of commandos we have a military atmosphere this season, too. It's the show's lightest season, we don't have any good character gone bad (Angel, Faith) or a big tragedy. It isn't a familiar BtVS season we are used to.

 Althought the main plots and Big Bad as not as strong as season 2 and 3, season 4 have very good storylines and episodes. I really like Willow's love for a woman, and it's very good character development. I'm very sad Oz is leaving and I think his character was underused in season 3. Xander and Anya's relationship is very sweet and fun to watch. Giles doesn't have a job, Faith wakes up from her coma. These are nice plots, but I'm not a fan of Riley he seems very stable for Buffy.

 The season also has one of the worst episodes Where the Wild Things Are. Favorite episodes from this season are: Something Blue, Hush (obviously), Who Are You, Restless. My point for this season is 7.5/10.",1326067200,,1152,4.4714285714285715

Season 4 is amazing.  It's starts great, and gets better and better. I do miss Angel and Cordelia, but the writing is still excellent and it didn't ruin the show.  I'm starting Season 5 in a few days and can't wait.

More good times in the Hellmouth. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER - THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON presents the Scoobies as college freshmen. It also introduces that sinister top secret military organization, the Initiative. Even more relevant - to me, anyway - Spike becomes a regular cast member. Friggin' yay.

There's a sense of freshness at the start of this season, and it totally has to do with Buffy now in UC Sunnydale and feeling once again like that insecure new kid on the block. It reminds us how frightening new experiences can be. In ""The Freshman"" when she gets her tush handed to her by a college vamp, she feels even more like a small fish in the big pond. But she gets over it quick. It's cool, by the way, that Willow feels entirely in her element, waxing all happy with the courses she's signed up for and all that. Oz is Oz, a cool and wry guy. Cordelia is gone, off to Hollywood to eventually bump into Angel in his own series. Giles, meanwhile, spends the entire season as a man of leisure (which is British for ""unemployed""). And poor Xander eschews college for living in his parents' basement and doing constructiony stuff. That's how we find the cast in the opening episode.

With Angel gone excepting the occasional crossover episodes (before BUFFY switched networks), obviously a new love interest was needed for the Buffster. In steps Riley Finn, ostensibly a wholesome college T.A. but harboring a dark secret (and, really, who in BUFFY doesn't harbor a dark secret, even wholesome bints like Riley?). From the onset, mysterious figures in commando gear are lurking about, abducting various monsters, and this modus operandi instantly calls to question the Initiative's true motivations and Riley's part in this. In the fantastic ""Hush,"" Riley and Buffy learn about each other's secret lives.

Joss Whedon and his writers continue to churn out episodes colored with wit and insight and the funny. As ever, real life intrudes into the Chosen One's supernatural slaying. Whedon is so adept at utilizing levity as the sleight of hand distraction to ease the audience down those ever darkening paths. Buffy has got a good thing going with Riley, except that Whedon so revels in exploring the Slayer's dark side. It was only a matter of time before Buffy is again feeling the tragic. Drawn to that dark side, always, Buffy just cannot stay happy with someone bland and comparatively normal like Riley, although it's not until Season 5 that Buffy would, by benign neglect and emotional disconnect, tell Captain America to sod off. Even early on, we note Riley's feeling of inadequacy when in Buffy's company.

I'm more interested in Spike's series re-entry. Cordelia always was the naysayer within the Scoobies and, with her gone, the show required a new thorn in the circle. The writers come up with a way to integrate Spike into the gang, by virtue of a behavioral chip, and his evil snark makes this season for me. In ""Something Blue"" we learn that Sarah Michelle Gellar and James Marsters demonstrate wonderful chemistry together. The writers are quick to jump on that. Also loved those moments of Spike being the awful roommate.

""This Year's Girl"" marks the return of Faith. ""Who Are You?"" is the Faith and Buffy body-switching episode, and it's fun watching Gellar and Eliza Dushku play each other's characters. Xander and Anya (another favorite character) step up their relationship, and this is when we first learn of Anya's vast fear of bunnies. Oz departs. Tara arrives. And if you know your ""Evil Alternate Dimension Willow"" history, this is where all that foreshadowing starts paying off.

The season's Big Bad - Adam (very Frankenstein's Monsteresque) - is a bore. I thought Professor Walsh made for a better villain. Interestingly, the villain who comes closest to destroying the Scoobies is Spike himself.

As usual, there are any number of favorite episodes. ""Fear Itself"" is the Halloween episode - which, granted, isn't as brilliant as Season 2's ""Halloween"" - but ""Fear Itself"" does offer a great revelatory moment when the Scoobies finally face the Fear Demon in the flesh. In ""Something Blue"" an ignored Willow inadvertently makes her wishes come true, and so we get the awesomely farcical Buffy and Spike being deliriously engaged. The deliciously spooky ""Hush"" is a creative exercise in the absence of dialogue, and the nightmarish grinning Gentlemen would end up topping everyone's list as the most terrifying adversaries Buffy has ever faced. ""Superstar"" is the alternate reality episode and it is just straight up fun, featuring that nerd Jonathan as master of his own domain. ""A New Man"" has Giles waking up to find himself turned into a Fyarl demon.

1260052,5,B000035Z1M,"Though at times facing criticism as the weakest out of the first four seasons, Buffy Season 4 must, I repeat, must be watched organically with seaons 1, 2,and 3. When you do that, season 4 will take on a whole new meaning. You will realize what you thought were glaring weaknesses in in season 4 were brilliant uses of continuing stories lines from season 3, and a wonderful set up for season 5. Was Riley as great replacement for Angel, no--do I think he was intended to fill that role, no. He was a unique Buffy love interest who has to be taken for what he is--when you meet him, you will see what i mean. Though I tend to agree that Adam as a villain was rather second rate, there is much more beating under the heart of this season. Remember as you watch this season, that this is Joss Whedon bringing his characters into college life, and as a result much of this season is one huge metaphore. As the first three seasons did for high school life, he captures the college freshman year perfectly. To the roomate from hell, and classic episodes like ""Hush"" that deals with the issue of not only losing one's' heart, but one's voice, this season is filled with terrific acting and heartfelt story lines. Other terrific things to watch for as you watch the season, spike being collared by Riley and his group of commandoes masquerading as college students, and OZ being collared as well as he makes his return to Sunnydale. Other things to watch---Buffy's encounter with the first slayer, intense, scary stuff. Watch the season finale carefully and I dare you not to think it is one of the most brilliant season finales you will ever see. It leads perfectly into season five with one word important phrase, if you turn your ear away, you'll miss it so listen very carefully. One cannot miss episode, ""Superstar"" one can miss, and did miss, even according to Joss Whedon, ""Beer bad."" its such an awful episode, you still have to love it!

The fact that Xander gets the very diseases (sick he seems as erotic to Ankya as sweating bare-chested) the Chumash contracted while virtually enslaved in the colonial era, and the choice of Hus's victims make Willow, who feels very guilty for the plight of the natives, and Giles, who insists Hus's victims are innocent, realize he must be after historical vengeance.

1260053,3,B000035Z1M,"Buffy season 4.  Widely considered to be the worst season of Buffy.  Worse than season 1, season 5, or even season 7.  I didn't really feel that way at all.  I didn't really feel that the season was particularly good, but there were a few parts of it that I liked.

 I want to first address some key problems that the writers were faced with.  They started out the season having lost two great characters, Cordelia and Angel.  Angel had left Sunnydale to be apart from Buffy, and to seek out his own spin-off series in LA.  That joke's getting old, I know.  They decided to move Cordelia to LA also, I guess because they didn't think they could do much with her on Buffy.  And then, five or six episodes into the season, they lost Oz.  Now that wasn't the writer's fault.  Actor Seth Green wanted to leave the show, he just wanted to move on and try other things.  That kinda stinks.  Oz was one of my favorite characters.  So just based on those problems, we already know this season may not be as good as previous seasons.  To fill the void left by those characters, over the next few seasons, we get introduced to a few new characters; Anya, who was actually introduced at the end of season 3, Tara, Riley, and.....Uugggghhhhhhh......Dawn.  Now I'm not going to go into this garbage pile of a character in this review, because she doesn't come on until season 5.  However I need to talk about some of the others.

 First of all, Anya.  I hated this character when she first came into this season.  She was kinda funny in season 3, but I just couldn't understand why Xander went to the prom with her.  I guess he couldn't get anyone else to go with him.  That makes sense.  But to have Xander start an actual relationship with her, then almost marry her in season 6?  SHE'S A FRIGGIN' DEMON!!!!!  Well, okay, ex-demon, but still!  Now I'll admit, she kinda grew on me, but still, her character didn't really serve any purpose on the show, other than to be the comic relief which was only funny half the time.  Now, Tara.  I know I could get in trouble for saying this, but based on the Willow who was established in the first three seasons, it made no sense for her to become a lesbian and fall in love with Tara.  Willow had some really strong heterosexual relationships in the first three seasons.  I read somewhere that Willow and Tara become cultural symbols or something in the gay/lesbian community.  Now I didn't really like Tara as a character much, either.  Why?  She's not a character.  She's just an extnesion of Willow.  In season 6, she finally develops a something of a personality.  But for this season, she serves no purpose other than to make Willow gay, and therefore make the show politically correct.  Lastly, the character Riley.  He and Dawn are probably the two most hated characters in the Buffyverse.  I don't really know why everyone hates him so much.  I thought he was an okay character.  He's not one of the best characters ever, but I didn't hate him.  In a way, he's what Buffy has always wanted.  He is capable of having a normal, healthy relationship with her, and he knows how to take care of himself, so there's not too much danger of him getting killed for being close to Buffy.  Now I don't think he's as cool as Angel.  I think too many people wanted him to be as cool as Angel, and were disappointed.

 Now as I said before, I didn't hate this season.  I just didn't think it was very good.  The first half of the season was mostly a bunch of cheesy, campy episodes.  I liked the second half slightly better.  I thought the initiative would be the bad guys.  I thought professor Walsh could have been the main villian, I think that would have been cool, but instead, we get the cyborg villian, Adam.  I didn't think he was very threatening, but he wasn't the worst villian ever, there would be worse villians in the future.  A villian like Adam is really only good for one episode, or maybe a two-part episode.  But at least he didn't obnoxiously take up the whole season, like Glory and The First did in seasons 5 and 7, respectively.  The end of this season was not very good, but it was entertaining to watch.  They defeat Adam by turning Buffy into....something....something really strong which apparently knows how to use the force.  So they beat Adam, and then the season finale has them having weird dreams for no reason, something with the first slayer.  Then they wake up, and the season ends.

 Overall, not a very good season.  However, there were a few episodes I liked.  The very first episode, ""The Freshman"", I liked.  I thought it was a great way to start the season.  Buffy is feeling overwhelmed with all the pressure from starting college, and her friends seem distant.  Because of this, her slaying suffers.  In the end, though, she pulls it together and beats the vampires and begins her year with renewed confidence.  I liked the episode ""Wild at Heart"".  Even though it was Oz's last episode as a regular, I liked the drama.  The episode ""Hush"" is considered to be the best episode of the whole series, and I'm inclined to agree.  The episode was a great blend of horror and comedy.  I liked the two episodes ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who are You"".  Faith returns and pulls a body-switch with Buffy.  She takes up Buffy's slaying, and discovers she enjoys being good.  Buffy swithes them back, though, and Faith leaves Sunnydale starting to feel remorse for everything she's done.

 Those are about the only episodes I really liked.  Other than that, the season is not very good.  But it is way better than some of the seasons that were to come.  I would not recommend buying this season.  If you've seen the first 3 seasons of Buffy, I'd recommend you just start watching Angel.  It's much better than the later seasons of Buffy.  If you really want to see the later seasons of Buffy, then go out and rent them.  Don't waste your money.",1255824000,4,5899,4.483962264150944

1260078,4,B000035Z1M,Season Four has some great highlights like the return of Spike and Willow and Tara falling in love. The only thing I didn't like this season was the whole government Initiative plot line. However the character of Riley played by Marc Blucas ended up being a good addition. One character I missed seeing was Buffy's mom Joyce but then again that was most likely just a precursor of what was to come in Season 5. Other than that the characters kept growing in the most unexpected directions. The dialogue was clever as always.,1239148800,,524,4.645161290322581

1260108,5,B000035Z1M,"Buffy season four introduced several changes to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series.  First, the show moved from High School to College.  Second, two major characters, Angel & Cordelia, moved to the spin-off series Angel.  Many would wonder if the show could move on from different changes.

I think it did, though I know some Buffy fans didn't.  A lot of folks say that this was the worst season, but I thought it was great.  The overall story arc is not as strong as seasons 2 & 3 (nothing in Buffy will ever touch those seasons), but this season probably has some of the best single episodes out of any season of Buffy.  Particularly the unique finale.

This season deserves much more credit than it gets.  Sure its not seasons 2 & 3, but its still great Buffy.",1218326400,2,775,4.517985611510792
1260109,4,B000035Z1M,"Ok, so I've been a fan of Buffy for a while now, but I've only recently begun buying and watching the show in boxed sets.  So far, I own seasons 1-5 and I saw seasons 6 and 7 on TV a while back (I'll buy them soon). I've watched each season that I own at least twice, and I've watched the first three seasons at least four times each.

Season 2 is my favorite.  Seasons 1, 3, and 5 are also very strong (5 seems to be unpopular, though).  Season 6 is fairly good, and I like seasons 7 and 4 least. Keep in mind this is my own personal rating, and that I like the whole series.  These rankings are just for comparing Buffy seasons to each other.

Good things about season 4:
*Buffy is maturing and learning to be an adult in a convincing way.
*Willow's character goes through a lot, and she changes and develops a great deal over the course of the season.
*The final episode is a bizarre impressionistic train-of-thought rollercoaster that is very confusing.  However, it goes a long way in demonstrating the true nature of every Buffy character and features references to many great novels and movies (especially Apocolypse Now/ Heart of Darkness).
*The Big Bad is intimidating, smart, and has a reasonably strong motivation for his actions.  Adam is less obviously ""evil"" than Angelus, the Master, or The First, but he's still not as deep or interesting as the Mayor or Faith.
*""Hush"" was a genuinely scary episode.  It was a very good micro-horror movie, and horror movies are rarely ""very good!""
*Riley's character wound up being more interesting than I expected.
*Xander's character becomes deeper.  He finds a role in the group that goes way farther than comic relief.
*Anya and Spike turn into real characters and remain as interesting and likeable fixtures in the show for the following seasons.
*Oz leaves (I didn't find him very interesting), and a more interesting character, Tara, moves in.

Bad things about season 4:
*Some episodes feel like random fluff.  The main plot of the season doesn't go anywhere, the main dilemma of the episode comes across as stilted and silly, and the actors feel like they're just repeating lines.
*There is almost no primary plot line for the season as a whole.  The Big Bad shows up late in the season, and the lesser villains up until then are barely enough to keep things interesting.
*Riley's character (I think) starts out very weak.  Marc Blucas didn't seem to be doing a very good acting job at first.  Late in the season and in season 5 he does much better.  I took a while to get to like Angel's character in seasons 1 and 2, but I eventually accepted him.  I had no issue with the acting.  With Riley, it took me a while to even consider him much of a character at all.
*The Initiative was interesting when it was menacing and mysterious.  Things just got sillier and ""cheap Sci-Fi original movie"" feeling.  The soldiers went from using real-looking guns and actual Tasers to some very silly costume-store looking lightening guns.  I think that the makeup jobs on Adam and his minion Forrest were a little too colorful-looking and not all that scary.
*I know Giles was bothered by being unemployed and that he struggled with feeling useless, but his character just didn't go anywhere beyond that.  He was much more interesting in other seasons.

And I just can't make up my mind about some things:
*Spike's little behavior-modification brain implant bothers me a bit.  It's kinda silly, but James Marsters actually does a good job making it convincing, and it allows everyone to get to know Spike a bit better.
*The final battle was both really awesome and a bit cheesy.  Part of it was because Adam looks a little silly and pulls some guns out of nowhere in a way that would make the Transformers laugh.  But, the battle-royal between soldiers and demons is pretty cool, and the way in which Adam is defeated was more interesting than just blowing him up with a big bomb like the the Scoobies did to the Mayor.

In summary:
Though a whole lot happened in this season in terms of character development and personal drama for the characters, the supernatural problems faced by Buffy and the gang were not as frightening or interesting as in other seasons.  Some episodes are still excellent, but many are far weaker than even the worst episodes of previous seasons.  Season 5 wound up being a major relief for me because it felt like a return to the stronger plot-driven episodes of seasons 1-3.  Season 4 didn't measure up to other Buffy seasons in my book, but the weakest season in a really great series is still well worth my money.",1215820800,2,4589,4.615763546798029

Wild At Heart- everytime i watch this one i get so sad because willow crys, oz leaves and yeah it's really sad.
Beer Bad- lol!  i think this episode is so funny and VERY underrated.
Primeval- buffy gets all crazy eyed with these crazy powers.  Very cool.
Hush- yeah yeah it's great, whatever.
This Year's Girl- Faith wakes up and all hell breaks loose!  Juicy..
Who Are You?- the episode where Faith switches bodies with Buffy, love it.
Superstar- kinda lame but i still love it.
Restless-  underestimated it at first but it is kind of awesome.

1260136,5,B000035Z1M,"Season four of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is yet another exciting and witty adventure as we see our favorite slayer and the scoobies heading to college. The show is well known for taking everyday hardships and problems, especially for youths, and giving them an interesting twist of representing them in the form of the monsters and creatures that make up the show. This season displays the horrors of college for any young person, evil teachers, partying, drinking, lonliness, trying to find your place in this world!
  After the loss of Angel, who has left for L.A (to his own series) and giving the show the unique crossover factor, Buffy starts the newest chapter in her life, college. Along with Willow and OZ, she experiences new horrors and trials. Xander has become a townie, after not going to college and Anya reappears to become his new girlfriend, giving the show more funny lines from the bluntness of the ex-demon. Giles struggles to find his role as Buffy's watcher again, as is the older man who hangs out with a bunch of young collegians. Within the season we are introduced to new characters, Tara, what's up with her and Willow...? Riley is Buffy's new boyfriend with a storyline of his own as we discover the INITIATIVE, a covert group of military and commandos who are out to study the demons and vamps, which include...Spike, who slowly enters the cast to become a Scoobie!! He pleads, ""I'm still bad!!"" Sure Spike.
  The show never loses it's touch of humor and wit especially within the dialogue. And the season includes the emmy award winning episode HUSH, where most of the episode is like a silent movie after a terrifying group named the GENTLEMEN steal the voices of everyone in Sunnydale! It is histerical! Another clever episode is SUPERSTAR which features the return of geeky Jonathan, and an alternate world where he is famous at everything! It is definatley an amazing season where we see Angel crossover, Faith returns, and messes Buffy's life up again with the old switching bodies routine. And the big bad of the season is ADAM, a human Demon cross breed!!So take a look and enjoy another season of our favorite Slayer Buffy, leaving you with wanting more!",1189641600,,2191,4.803713527851459

Season Four deals with adulthood, and life after high-school. Buffy tries to finds herself in a whole new school with the absence of her former lover Angel, whom she found comfort in.

The ""Big Bad"" of this season is a secret military organization named ""The Initiative"" and they perform experiments on demons of all sorts, Not quite interesting but I found it refreshing and unique.

Not to be disappointed, this season has two of my all-time favourite Buffy episodes, The very scary and brilliant ""Hush"" and the amazingly written ""Restless"".

1260140,4,B000035Z1M,"I consider Buffy season 2 its least consistent season, but four is easily its least coherent.  It transitions between the Scoobies in high school and post-school, between Jonathon the nerd and Jonathan the villain, and between Faith the villain and Faith the hero, but these stories don't span the entire year.  There are fewer characters in every episode of this season (only the core four) than in all others.  Many of the best episodes feature Oz, Faith, and Jonathan, but they seem more like epilogues to the high school years and prologues to the later ones because these characters are only in a few episodes.  It lacks a central theme: college is not the focal point of this season the way high school was in the early years, nor is it about family like the fifth season or self-destruction like the sixth.

This is also the lightest season of Buffy: while most seasons deal with death or likable characters going bad, the only sad thing that takes place in this entire year is Oz' departure.  The strange thing about Joss Whedon shows is that they are often funnier when they are dark, so this season is neither as humorous nor as heartbreaking as the second, third, and fifth seasons.

And yet there's a tremendous amount to like about this season.  Joss Whedon's writing talents became evident in season 2, but it's not until the fourth season that his direction becomes equally important.  With the silent ""Hush"" and the all-dream ""Restless"", Whedon became the first television creator since David Lynch whose direction stood out as much as a great movie director's.

I prefer the way Oz was handled this year than in season three: rather than being in the entire season but always staying in the background, he's in a third of this year but is the star of two of the episodes.  Giles' mid-life crisis this year is fun as well, as he takes up alcohol and music as he no longer has a job as a librarian or watcher.

One of the main problems the writers faced was balancing the show's past with exploiting the potential of college.  The first two episodes capture the bewilderment of the first weeks of college wonderfully, but feel disconnected from the rest of the show, as if they were the pilot of a brand new series.  In the third episode Spike, Anya, and Harmony are reintroduced and it starts to feel more like Buffy, but there's hardly any college humor from this point on.  All of the funniest characters (Xander, Spike, Giles and Anya) have no connection to the university, which is a stark contrast from the first three seasons when everyone but Angel was a high school student or employee.

This season also receives some flack for The Initiative plot, which is an X-Files-ish sci-fi conspiracy that's very different from the other seasonal plots and not terribly great.  I think it receives too much of the blame for this season's shortcomings, as season 2 is the only season of the show where the plot was the central force.  Joss Whedon, who had written most of season 2's plot and a little of season 3's, doesn't even touch this one, making it obvious that it is of little importance.  I still find Adam more interesting than the first season's Mayor and the last year's First Evil, and the episode where he is defeated is Buffy at it's Hollywood action best.

The vast majority of these episodes are good (I recommend skipping the infamous ""Beer Bad"", and a few of them are downright classics, but there is barely any connecting thread uniting these episodes.  Luckily the remaining seasons will build on the foundation led by season four and make  it clear that these episodes were important.  You shouldn't skip season four, nor should you want to.

NOTE: Even if you have no desire to watch the ""Angel"" spinoff, you should at least watch its 18th and 19th episodes, which wrap up this year's ""Faith"" story arc wonderfully.",1179014400,7,3851,4.687964338781575
1260141,5,B000035Z1M,"Before I say anything else, I will say that I do not own the slim set I own the original bulky version.  I will give some people advice right now, if you do not own any of the buffy season's on DVD get the slim version because it helps your DVD's from getting damaged being that all six discs come in three silm dvd cases or just buy all seven seasons super pack might cost more money but it's worth it, if you don't any of the seasons and if you are superfan like I am.  I have heard some mixed reviews about the fourth season of Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  This was a challenging year to say the least for both the characters on the series and for Joss Whedon and company.  Not only did Joss and his team have to work on Buffy The Vampire Slayer but they also had to work on its new spinoff Angel which leaves the original series and it's spinoff kind of missing something.  But that slowly goes away as the episodes progress.  One thing that is the main arc ""some people would argue did it even have an arc"" is that college is a period of change.  Some good, some bad, some that you didn't see coming.  I have find it interesting that the thing that everybody was complaining about, meaning most of my fellow Joss Whedon loving univirse fans saying things like ""Why is everyone changing and why are there more stand alone episodes?""  That was the point that college was about experiencing new things and realizing that some things happen very quickly and you get over them and some things stick around for a while. One of the things that interesting through this entire season is the fact that additions and subtraction of cast members.  Which you'll see by the changing title sequences this season.  Another thing that's interesting is the fact that the main villian does not arrive until episode 13 which is late for a Buffy The Vampire Slayer season.  Some episodes to look out for as really some of the best of the series ""Hush"", ""Restless"", and ""Who Am I""  all written and directed by Joss Whedon.  And just for you factoid nuts out there ""Hush"" and ""Restless"" are two of Joss favorite Buffy The Vampire Slayer episodes ever.  The special features are very good in this package.  The audio commentaries can be boring for those of who have no interest in learning about how these episodes were made.  So, if you're looking for a Will Ferrell commentary you're not going to find it here.  The featurettes are probably the best special feature in particular the season overview.  Lastly, Joss Whedon said ""That was probably our best season episode by episode"".  It has been almost four years since Buffy The Vampire Slayer had it's last episode on the now extinct UPN network and looking back on all seven season he is probably right.  But if you're looking for a season that has a very strong arc see season five and season seven.",1174780800,2,2835,4.466019417475728

Many fans regard Season Four as a let-down, but I fail to see it that way. Season Four is all about change, which I think is handled admirably. This must have been a tough season to write, but I think it came out beautifully. Joss Whedon couldn't have handled it any better. I do have to jump into the majority over the character Riley Finn (Marc Blucas). He was a somewhat boring character who was given a little too much screen time (And should not have been in the opening credits.) Along with the departures of Angel and Cordelia, we also see the heart-breaking departure of Oz. However, fear not Willow fans, for she soon meets Tara, one of the finest characters ever put on the show. The Willow and Tara relationship is my personal favorite relationship in the ""Buffy"" universe. We are also treated to the hilarious Xander and Anya relationship. The idea of The Initiative is pretty cool, as is the ""Big Bad"" named Adam. It is also quite fun when Spike gets ""neutered!"" The sight of the scoobies charging into The Initiative in ""Primeval"" sent chill down my spine. Then there is the Emmy-nominated ""Hush"" (and just why Joss Whedon never won is beyond me. Also, where are the Emmys for the cast?! Has the academy ever even seen the show?!) ""Hush"" is absolutely brilliant. Lets not forget ""Restless.""

1260158,5,B000035Z1M,"Since I had only seen seasons 6 & 7 when they originally aired, I did not know who Riley was when he came back to help Buffy in one episode.  I assumed he was a boyfriend, but it turns out that he was more than that.

Season 4 of Buffy is essentially ""Buffy: The Complete College Year,"" as she did not make it through her second year in season 5 when her mom died and when she died.  This season is full of interesting takes on what it's like your freshmen year in college, including the awful roommate, too much drinking, and, of course, the new boyfriend (Riley).  Maybe Whedon and company were out of college ideas by season 5, but there's a bunch to enjoy in season 4.",1163030400,7,672,4.186046511627907
1260159,5,B000035Z1M,"Yet I still give it 5 stars? That's because, and this is such a cliche, but even at its worst, is better than most series best. Coming after the emotionally charged season 2 and the action packed near-perfect season 3, season 4 was not going to be as sharp. So while episodes don't reach the heights the last 2 seasons had, they were still worth watching anyway since there's very little filler here.

Buffy graduated from high school, and cut off everybody's future chance to since she blew it up fighting a huge snake. Well now it's university time and things are just as worse. She's dealing with hard professors, an incredibly weird roommate, an old enemy(2 in fact) and a secret military group called the Initiative that doesn't like Buffy poking around since she has ties to one of its officers.

The season starts with ""The Freshman"" and like all the other season openers, it's merely okay. From then on we get episodes that range from entertaining to just merely serviceable. One blemish is ""Beer Bad"" where drinking beer leads to men literally acting like cavemen. While it contains a hilarious performance by Sarah, it just feels rather meh the entire time. That gets saved later with ""Hush"", probably the coolest idea for an episode. The Gentlemen, floating bald guys with wicked smiles stealing the voices of everyone in town and then cut out their hearts with no one the wiser since they can't scream. Most of the episode plays out with no dialogue and there's even some funny jokes(the hand motion sans Mr. Pointy is quite funny).

A welcome addition(although I'm getting tired of the overusage of the story) is when Faith returns and manages to switch bodies with Buffy. While I get tired of the body swap episodes, this one's quite funny and allows both actresses to do something a bit different. Eliza totally nails the Buffy character in Who Are You, especially when she's convincing people of her identity. Then we have the only season finale to not be a big huge blowout: the characters have very weird dreams featuring the first Slayer in Restless.

Is there some trouble spots? Well, the episodes aren't as consistent as season 3 was. They're usually meh episodes that are very funny are just really great ones, exception being Beer Bad which is just awful. The Initiative storyline doesn't seem as big a threat as Angelus or the Mayor was or even the Master and the Riley/Buffy relationship doesn't have the attraction it should, despite the sometimes often physical scenes(such as the sex minded Where the Wild Things Are).

One nice thing about shows like Buffy or Smallville is you can put whatever episode you felt like on without losing your place. 24 or Lost makes you feel like if you missed one episode then you're completely screwed. While season 4 may not be the best, it's just misunderstood and ultimately a fairly solid season.",1157155200,8,2863,4.775757575757575

All the content and with half the calories, these sets make collecting my fave series easy and affordable!  In addition, the 4th season contains the critically acclaimed episode 'Hush' which introduces Buffy's deadliest and creepiest enemies yet, the Gentlemen.

1260161,4,B000035Z1M,"Season four of Buffy has often been described as somewhat unfocused, but I find this an unfair assessment. This particular season is about the Scoobies as they begin their college years, and this is an unfocused time in a young person's life. Therefore it is only fitting that some of that unevenness of the lives of the characters would transfer to the season itself. As far as I can remember, the portrayal of college life was spot on, and it was interesting to observe Buffy, who at the end of her senior year had finally got a bead on being a slayer and a student, suddenly cast adrift again in the world of university life, without the companionship of her beloved Angel.

In the first few episodes she deals with a dorm roommate that is not only a demon but borrows her clothes and eats her food, a manipulative boy who is not a demon but uses her and casts her aside despite that fact, and a psychology professor that seems downright sinister. Spike, the blonde vampire from season two joins the cast, mainly as an antagonist made harmless by virtue of a scientific experiment in which he is made to feel intense pain anytime he harms a human. He is a great addition, and it is unfortunate he was not given a bigger role during this season. The departure of Oz in episode six is offset by the addition of Amber Benson to the cast as Tara. In season four Willow becomes aware of her attraction not to women in general, but to Tara in particular. To be specific she falls in love with Tara, who just happens to be a woman. The entire evolution of Willow and Tara's relationship is handled beautifully and is one of the great story arcs of the season.

Another particularly interesting facet of this season is that Giles and Xander, who could not be more different, both find their lives adrift during this season. Xander, the Scoobie that is not college-bound, is attempting to find a place in life. Trapped in a world of dead-end jobs and only able to afford living in his parents' basement, he does finally find a girl that appreciates him- the ex-vengeance demon Anya from season three. As for Giles, he is no longer Buffy's watcher, and he is also no longer employed as school librarian since the destruction of Sunnydale High School at the end of season three. This whole situation is explored in the excellent episode ""A New Man"". There are also some great individual episodes. ""Hush"" is perhaps the scariest Buffy episode ever, and ""Something Blue"" is hilarious as Willow conjures a spell in which her word becomes fact. Also, Faith returns in a two-parter that includes a very funny verbal exchange with Spike that has become the basis of many a piece of fan fiction.

Unfortunately, the two things that were not very inspiring about this season were the main storyline- a group of scientists backed by the military whose ""creation"" escapes and comes up with an apocalyptic scheme, and also the relationship between Buffy and Riley, a graduate student on campus with a few secrets of his own. Unlike the relationship between Buffy and Angel, or between Willow and Tara, I did not feel any attraction between the two characters, much less feel it grow into love. Buffy and Riley just run into each other in somewhat comic situations until one day Riley just comes to some kind of inspired revelation that he wants to date Buffy. Likewise, I never understand what Buffy sees in Riley other than a ""normal"" boy with values who probably won't harm her emotionally. In short, any chemistry is just missing, although the sexual part of the relationship is thrown at the audience time and time again. In summary, this transitional season of Buffy has many terrific individual episodes and some great character development, it was just a shame that the main thread that usually weaves the season together- the season villain- was not particularly scary or interesting.",1147219200,,3873,4.692647058823529
1260162,5,B000035Z1M,"Let me start by issuing a spoiler alert.  It is not customary by Internet etiquette to issue such an alert for shows that have been out for several years, but let me err on the side of caution.

Immediately after offering THE X-FILES in new and cheaper slim-pack editions, they now offer the entirety of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER in similar packaging.  The difference is that unlike THE X-FILES, where they cut out enough special features to reduce the original seven discs to six, the BUFFY releases are uncut.

Of the seven seasons that comprise BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, Season Four is the most perplexing.  On the one hand, it is almost universally regarded as one of the weakest of the seven seasons, usually ranked with Season Six as the weakest.  I personally think that Season One is the weakest followed closely by this one.  On the other hand, a lot of BUFFY fans, when they rank their all time favorite episodes, end up putting a disproportionate number of Season Four episodes on the list.  Two of the episodes, ""Hush"" and ""Restless,"" might be consensus picks for the five best episodes ever.  How to resolve this paradox?  It isn't hard.  Although Season Four had a large number of truly great episodes, the overall Season Four arc was probably the weakest of all seven seasons.  The introduction of the Initiative and the Frankenstein-like Adam, the season's ""big bad,"" seemed in conflict with the show as a whole.  In the earlier seasons and especially Season Five, much of the brilliance of the show and a great deal of the emotional tension derived from the season-long narrative.  Season Four almost completely lacked the kind of narrative drama that made Seasons Two and Three so exhilarating.  So even though the season featured a large number of truly great episodes, they tended to stand on their own, unlike previous seasons where the best episodes were integrated in a central narrative.

Season Four finds Buffy and Willow going off to University of California at Santa Cruz . . . uh, I mean Sunnydale (UC Santa Cruz doubled for UC Sunnydale), Xander making his way through a string of entry level jobs while becoming romantically involved with former vengeance demon Anya, Giles without much to do since being fired as Buffy's Watcher and without a librarian job since Sunnydale High School had been blown up at the end of Season Three,  and Angel and Cordelia off to Los Angeles (and their own series).  And the evil vampire Spike finds himself defanged by the Initiative, unable to engage in violence towards anyone but demons, inadvertently beginning his transformation into an ally of the Scooby gang.  The season also sees the departure of Oz from the show (Seth Green was getting too many movie offers to make his staying on the show in a supporting character to make much sense) and the introduction of Tara as Willow's girlfriend, thus introducing arguably the first normalized lesbian relationship on television.  Oh, and Buffy gets a new boyfriend, Riley Finn, along with Connor from ANGEL one of the two least popular characters in the Slayerverse.

As mentioned above, the main narrative is disappointing compared to prior seasons.  The Initiative never became especially interesting or compelling and Adam just too wooden to match the appeal of the Master, Angelus, or the Mayor from the first three seasons.  Much of the reason was the fact that the heavy make up made much in the way of either facial or physical expression difficult to impossible.  The romance between Riley and Buffy in neither this nor the next season interested fans of the show, so there was an emotional void in the season as well.  Interestingly, Buffy's best romantic episodes took place not on BUFFY but on ANGEL, especially in the amazing ""I Will Remember You.""  Nonetheless, despite the weak central narrative arc and the lack of an emotional center, the season contains a host of amazing episodes.  Some are funny, some are moving, some scary, some deep, and some a mixture of all of these.  The most famous episode of Season Four, and one of the two or three most famous episodes ever, is the haunting ""Hush.""  Some critics had complained that the writing of BUFFY was being overpraised, that it seemed better than it really was because of Joss Whedon's amazing skills at writing dialogue (even when he didn't actually write an episode, he would help punch up scripts by adding some lines).  His response, therefore, was to write a script in which all the characters lost their voices for the bulk of the episode.  The result was sheer genius with a host of marvelous sight gags and a wonderful meditation on the difficulty of communication.  The Gentlemen in the episode are among the most haunting creatures in the history of TV, comparable to anything one will find in THE TWILIGHT ZONE or THE X-FILES.  They look very much like well-dressed Victorian cadavers, impeccably polite, who move by floating eerily along a few feet above the ground, cutting hearts out of their victims.  So that their victims will be unable to scream, they have captured the voices of all the residents of Sunnydale.  No one who ever sees the episode will be able to forget it.  Whedon says that one of his goals in writing the episode was to produce in the Gentlemen monsters that would stand out as the great television monsters of their time.  There is little doubt that he succeeded.  This was also the episode where Riley, who Buffy thought was just a Psychology teaching assistant but who really worked for the monster-hunting Initiative, and Buffy discover that neither was who they thought they were.  The episode ends with Buffy and Riley standing in her room staring at each other in silence after one of them says, ""We need to talk.""

The season was filled with a host of other great episodes.  Nearly as highly praised is ""Restless,"" the interestingly anti-climatic season finale.  The Scoobies had defeated Adam the season's Big Bad, the previous week.  ""Restless"" is a wonderful reflection on the previous four seasons and the journeys that all four principle characters have traveled, presented as a series of dreams of their being killed by the First Slayer (except Buffy, who resists her and thereby saves the others) while watching APOCALPYSE NOW (interesting given Riley's comment to Buffy earlier in the season that since meeting her he had had to learn the plural of apocalypse).  The episode also contains another and final hint about Season Five when in Buffy's dream Tara appears and tells her, after she has left a room, ""Be back before dawn.""  In Season Three in a dream that Buffy and Faith shared Faith mentioned ""Little Sis"" and referred to something that would happen exactly two years later (it would be Buffy's death to save Dawn).

Speaking of Faith, another great pair of episodes were the two featuring her:  ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Am I?""  One of the most amazing things about BUFFY is the way it would take on traditional subjects and handle it better than any other show on TV ever had.  There has never been a more powerful episode about losing one's virginity than that from Season Two of Buffy, never a better episode on TV about death than ""The Body"" from Season Five, and although a number of TV shows have attempted musical episodes, all pale compared to ""Once More, With Feeling"" from Season Six.  A plot staple on television has been having two characters switch bodies.  Joss Whedon was never content with just doing their take on such an oft-repeated plot device.  Instead, the episode becomes an amazing discourse on self-hatred, with Faith in Buffy's body doing Faith kind of things in Buffy's social nexus.  There are many very funny moments, such as the great scene in which Faith encounters Spike, realizing that he is a vampire but also realizing something that Buffy never had (his basic sexual attraction to Buffy), and then offering a hyper-sexualized description of what she could do for him if she wanted.  There is a memorable moment, reminiscent of Travis Bickle's mirror scenes in TAXI DRIVER, where Faith, trying out Buffy's body for the first time, stands in front of the mirror, towel wrapped about her following a bath, rehearsing variations on her caricature of how she views Buffy.  Over and over she states variations of ""It's wrong!"" obviously viewing Buffy as a goody two shoes.  Interestingly, just before she escapes from Sunnydale she hears on TV about three vampires who have taken over a church during worship service.  She goes there to take on the vampires and when one of them asks her why she doesn't just go away and not risk her life in saving the others she replies, ""Because it's wrong,"" with no hint of irony in her voice.  The episode starts off as a cruel trick on Faith's part, one that will allow her to escape Sunnydale and the Watchers Council that wants to capture and neutralize her as a rogue Slayer, but ends with Faith realizing how much she hates herself by understanding how Buffy has a much better life because of her relationships and principles.  Buffy and Faith encounter each other in the church just before switching bodies and fight, with Faith in Buffy's body getting Buffy in hers on the floor, beating on her face, screaming how she hates her, obviously meaning that she actually hates herself.  The two episodes lead to two additional great episodes on ANGEL, where she goes to kill Angel, eventually trying to get Angel to kill her as an odd form of suicide/penance.  The four episodes comprise the beginning of Faith's salvation and transformation to a decent human being.

There are many other great episodes as well, including the hysterical ""Something Blue,"" where a spell by Willow that goes wrong leads to Buffy and Spike getting engaged and planning their wedding; ""The I in Team,"" in which Buffy briefly becomes an ally of the Initiative; ""A New Man,"" in which Giles is turned into a demon and almost killed by Buffy; ""The Yoko Factor,"" in which Spike attempts to help Adam, who has promised to remove the chip that keeps Spike from killing humans, by turning the Scoobies against one another; and the wonderfully funny ""Superstar,"" in which Jonathan, who dominates the briefly redesigned opening credits, is suddenly the center of life in Sunnydale.  I should, however, also mention that the season also contains the episode that usually wins fan polls of the worst BUFFY episode ever, the simply dreadful ""Beer Bad,"" in which a doctored batch of beer turns Buffy into a Neanderthal.  Still, all in all this is an imminently watchable, if overall disappointing season.  No fan of BUFFY will, however, not want to own it, and with the new inexpensive edition, there is no reason not to do so.",1146355200,85,10715,4.826586433260394

1260174,4,B000035Z1M,"Buffy reaches it's sophmores years as the show enters its fourth season.  This season has one or 2 ups and down but the season makes a satisfying closing statement to a point that the creators started to make at the start of the 4th year.

From The Freshman, the opening episode of the season, right through to gems such as Hush!, This Years Girl!, and the climax of the season Primeval and Restless.  This season shines in many ways, I think the strongest point of the season was the silent episode Hush, which in my opinion is one of TV's best representation of an old format.

The actual DVD set itself is beautifully packaged and fits with the current design of all the season dvds, we get alot of extras for our money with very in depth commentaries from the creators and actors on the show.  The season round-up special feature is also good as it highlights the point of the whole season (if you didn't get it already) and highlights points in this season that foreshadow future evens in later seasons.

All in all, this is an amazing set which manages to capture the entire season beautifully in both sound and picture quality.  Wonderfully writen episode contribute to excellent acting and make this a worthwhile buy for any fan of cult tv.",1141257600,2,1248,4.569506726457399
1260175,5,B000035Z1M,"Have you read the reviews...both here and elsewhere? ""No continuity"", ""No chemistry"", wahh wahh wahh.

If you watch the commentarys and extras, they explain what most fans got the first time around. Dealing with Joss Wheden means you need to bring your game up to a new viewing level. All those things you don't like, they were on purpose...and ""why"" are you asking yourself? For the same reason we blew up the school in season three. Besides the demons, besides the ""end of the world""...""again?"", is the story of the life of a young lady. And anyone who can remember their first year of college can remember the chaos, the feeling of freedom to explore coupled with a disconection and confusion. Keep that in the back of your mind and the entire season has very strong arch, maybe the strongest of any season.

After that, enjoy the frivality. Don't skip because you don't think they are important episodes. ""Beer Bad"", ""Hush"", and the season finale ""Restless"" are wonderful for how completely...well...complete they are.

Not to mention GILES SINGS in three episodes. Who hasn't called out ""Free Bird"" from the back of the bar? And Giles accoustic! Awesome!",1140825600,2,1159,4.873096446700508

I mean their were some episodes that were good but it just fell so very short of the previous seasons. I will tell you Buy Angel Season 1. This is where all the writers focus and attention was at, trying to establish Angel which is a Spin off of The Buffy Series. Which I will say is EXCELLENT. The Angel series is different from the buffy series but it's wonderful!!! The First Season of Angel however does fall inline with the BTVS series Season 4. So how can you not watch this season if you are a buffy fan and how can you skip a season of a series anyway? but it was a major disappointment especially the season's last espiodes. I just skipped it. You have been warned.",1138665600,3,951,4.318435754189944
1260178,5,B000035Z1M,"After watching the amazing content provided in ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" seasons 2 and 3, it's hard to believe that the series could top or even measure up to the standard it had set for itself. Add in the fact that the show lost pivotal characters like Angel, Cordelia and later Oz, and it becomes even harder to believe that the show could continue on triumphantly. However with season 4 Joss Whedon and his team of writers have taken the series to new levels, proving that they could indeed survive all the aftermath of what happened in previous seasons. Without a doubt, season 4 was a step in the right direction for Buffy and the scoobies, and like it or hate it, the show gained tremendous momentum which would carry all the way through to season 6. No matter the disputes among fans on how good or bad this season is, it is essential viewing for all interested in Buffy/Angel, and may even impress some with the amazing amount of content and depth it provides.

To begin the gang has all graduated from high school. Now they prepare to take on the new world known as College, as Buffy (Gellar), Willow (Hannigan) and Oz (Green) all enroll in UC Sunnydale. However to think that the trials of a slayer or the ferocity of the hellmouth would end with High School would be incorrect. The biggest turn in season 4 is the introduction of ""The Initiative"", a secret government organization created to eliminate (although we would find out their true intentions later in the season) all forms of demonic life threatening the human population. This took the series somewhat out of the Goth/Horror frame, and added a touch of something new, which I for one enjoyed. Along with The Initiative came Buffy's new love interest Riley, a nice farm boy from Iowa who spends his nights as a soldier for The Initiative. To replace the outgoing Angel, Cordelia and Oz (who leaves shortly into the season) we get a new trio: Spike, Anya and Tara. Whedon's masterstroke of bringing Spike (Marsters) back into the story and forcing him to reluctantly fight alongside Buffy and her allies because of a chip implemented in his head by the Initiative was pure genius. Thankfully Spike would remain a part of the cast throughout the rest of the series. Anya (Caufield), ex-vengeance demon and now love interest of Xander, provides a lot of comic relief as she struggles to adapt to the human way of life and its drawbacks. Tara (Benson), Willow's new ""girlfriend"", is also a nice addition to the cast, although her acting is sometimes flat and unconvincing. While they might not exactly be Angel, Cordy and Oz, the new additions give the cast plenty of chemistry and dynamics to sustain the show.

The story arc for season four is quite nice as well. The first deals with the introduction of The Initiative, and finding out the mystery behind their intentions in Sunnydale. The second concerns Adam, The Initiative's super demon soldier, who was constructed to be a superb military combat weapon (ah true intentions revealed) for war. Unfortunately for the Initiative, Adam decides that he would much rather do his own bidding, and after killing his creator Professor Walsh, escapes into the outside world to reak havok. Besides the underlying arc theme, the episodes found off the arc are great as well. None more so than the terrific two parter in which Faith comes out of her coma and switches bodies with Buffy. There are a couple of clunkers here and there (Buffy once again rededicating herself to slaying, Buffy dealing with a roommate from hell), but overall the content found on these episodes is easily on par with any of the three previous seasons.

As far as the set is concerned, You get the commentaries on selected episodes, as well as behind the scenes footage, actor info and bloopers. These are all nice touches to the set, but only the most die hard fans will truly appreciate what comes along with the episodes. Even so the extras are just a nice bonus, because the real reason to get this set is for the show itself. While they might be welcomed, the extras are only icing on the cake to the excellent episodes found within.

For all concerned, Season 4 could have been the biggest disaster the series had seen, but instead Whedon and company proved that their well of ideas had not yet run dry. Everything introduced in season 4 was fresh and new, and really gave the series a different feel and renewed success. Like it or hate it, there's no denying how important this season was to the show. The departure of Angel, Cordy, Wesley (who were spun off into ""Angel"") and ""Oz"" could have easily hurt the show beyond belief. Instead it turned out to be one of the best moves the writers ever made, as we also got another stellar show in ""Angel"". If you were ever interested in the BtVS series, then season 4 is a must, even if you're fond of the previous three. There's too many good things to say about this season, and I could never list them all. Just do it already!",1135728000,,4971,4.6454545454545455

Buffy and Riley just run into each other in somewhat comic situations until one day Riley just comes to some kind of inspired revelation that he wants to date Buffy. Likewise, I never understand what Buffy sees in Riley other than a ""normal"" boy with values who probably won't harm her emotionally. In short, any chemistry is just missing, although the sexual part of the relationship is thrown at the audience time and time again. In summary, this transitional season of Buffy has many terrific individual episodes and some great character development, it was just a shame that the main thread that usually weaves the season together- the season villain- was not particularly scary or interesting.",1129766400,,3873,4.692647058823529

1260193,5,B000035Z1M,"I'm always puzzled when I hear season 4 referred to as the weakest season, a let down after the scoobies' high school years. If forced to choose, I'd rate this as my favorite of all 7 seasons. It's definitely a period of transition and of growing apart for the characters which is perhaps where some people's disappointment comes in - however I find it makes them all the more real and endearing.

Xander becomes more than the goofy side-kick we're used to as we see him relegated to the basement by his parents (and forced to pay rent no less!) and struggling to figure out how to make a living while his best friends start their college careers. Giles has lost his purpose now he's no longer Buffy's Watcher. This leads to the rare treat of a Giles-centric episode, A New Man, in which he is turned into a Ffioral (sp.?) demon - a metaphor for his feelings of alienation from the group. (And he has a girlfriend! And he can sing! Who knew it?!) After the departure of Oz, Willow discovers another side to herself when she meets fellow-witch Tara. Buffy is recovering from Angel leaving town and tentatively starts a relationship with a ""normal guy"" (This being BtVS things are never are they seem.) Spike is ""neutered"" and much to his disgust can no longer harm humans. I could go on...

The Emmy-nominated Hush appears in this season - a truly creepy episode taking place in total silence after the first 15 minutes. It's a good episode to entice newbies to the show (and contains the most hilarious 10 minutes you'll find anywhere). Restless, the season ender, is my favorite all time episode - surreal and portentous, I can rewatch this over and over without getting bored. There's always something new to pick up on.

There are many other wonderful episodes but I'll end with mentioning that Faith, the rogue slayer (and Buffy's dark side?) appears - with a couple of scenes that you won't forget!

So buy, rent, or borrow this set - you won't be sorry!",1121817600,4,1959,4.588571428571429
1260194,4,B000035Z1M,"Season 4 of Buffy upset a lot of fans, most of whom claimed it was ""misguided"" or ""underwhelming.""  The funny thing is, when I read negative reviews of this season, the subtext that usually screams out is: ""I fear change.  Season 4 was different, therefore it was not good.""  Flawed logic?  You bet.

Yes, in its fourth season Buffy changed significantly: it became a show for adults, instead of a show for teenagers.  Being an adult, I think this change was for the better.

Since a large portion of Buffy's fan base has always been made up of teens, or even pre-teens, I think it's this new adult nature that REALLY upset the average Buffy fan.  But for those of us who have had enough teen melodrama, Season 4 is a refreshing change of pace, and much more innovative and entertaining than the preceding three seasons.  It leaves behind the teen pressures, worries, and ""Dawson's Creek"" subplots of Seasons 2-3, and heads into more interesting territory.

And for that matter, with Season 4 the cast was able to relax and give more natural performances.  By this time, none of the leading actors looked like teenagers, so with Season 4's new setting at Sunnydale University, the cast was able to act like what they really were: young adults in their early to mid 20s.  But perhaps the best change in Season 4 was the replacement of the previous seasons' melodrama with nearly Simpsons-esque humor.  I mean, what would YOU rather see: Buffy crying over Angel yet again, or Buffy clubbing her most recent paramour with a stick?

The season starts off, as is typical with Buffy, on shaky feet, slowly getting its bearings.  Season opener ""The Freshman"" has never been one of my favorites, and things really don't get interesting until the shenanigans with Buffy's object of lust Parker Abrams are out of the way, and the Initiative/Riley Finn plot comes into the picture.  After that it's smooth sailing, but even the early episodes aren't that bad; most are better than the early episodes in Seasons 2 and 3, and even ""Beer Bad,"" universally hated by Buffy fans, is full of laughs and entertainment value.

An early arc concerns fan-favorite Oz (Seth Green) encountering a fellow werewolf, an attractive girl who tries to take him away from Willow.  Creator/writer Joss Whedon reveals in a commentary that this arc was supposed to be season-long; thank God it wasn't.  Unfortunately, the actress chosen to play the female werewolf is laughably bad, and having to endure her throughout an entire season would have been torture.  Luckily, Seth Green decided to leave the series early, saving us from this.  Most importantly, Oz's departure from the line-up resulted in the entrance of my favorite character, punk vampire Spike, to the main cast.  I'm not sure if it's just personal bias, but I've always felt that it's after Oz leaves that Season 4 really gets in gear.

As mentioned, the main cast was able to give more natural performances this season, acting in roles more aligned to their actual ages, instead of still trying to pretend like they were high schoolers.  Sarah Michelle Gellar turns in her usual stellar performance; I think most Buffy fans take her for granted, as she performs so well, all of the time.  Nicholas Brendon as Xander proves yet again that he has the best comic timing in the cast.  Anthony Stewart Head loosens up in his portrayal of Giles, though unfortunately the character doesn't have much to do this season, what with Sunnydale High having been blown up in Season 3.  Alyson Hannigan is a great actress as always, but I have to admit Willow really bugs me this year.  Not due to the gayness, I could care less about that, but just, I don't know, how much of an annoying, sulking wallflower she becomes.

Season 4 also provides us with what I consider the best Buffy cast of characters.  Besides the main four mentioned above, former vengeance demon Anya joins the cast.  A replacement Cordelia, Anya is even more blunt and hard-hearted, and her scenes are always one of the highlights of any episode.  But more importantly, Spike joins the cast, and his sarcasm and cynicism are a breath of fresh air.  This season he's pretty much neutered from attacking humans, and so must work with the ""Scooby Gang,"" which entails countless comedic results.

This season also sees the entrance of Riley Finn, probably the most underappreciated character in the Buffy universe.  The pre-teen fans of this series hated him, undoubtedly because he didn't sulk all day or stalk Buffy from the shadows, like Angel.  Also, many complained that Riley's alpha-male, Jimmy Stewart-esque bearing just didn't fit in with the world of Buffy, but I think that's precisely the reason his character was introduced.  In a regular action TV show, Riley would be the main character, the take-charge white guy who can kick anyone's ass at any given time.  Here he must compete with the female-empowerment that Buffy is known for, and the results are always enjoyable to watch.

My five favorite episodes of the season:

1. Hush - Without a doubt, THE episode to show someone new to Buffy, or to convince a naysayer of how great this series could be.  Written and directed by creator Joss Whedon, Hush is possibly the single best episode in the show's history.  Imagine a twisted collaboration between Tim Burton and Matt Groening and you'll be half there; this episode can be watched over and over, and lose none of its appeal.  The plot has to do with a group of fairy tale monsters robbing the voices of Sunnydale's residents; nearly half an hour of the episode is sans dialog.  Hush is also very cinematic; all the more reason to regret that this DVD is not in widescreen.

2. Superstar - One of the great things about Buffy is that it would take chances.  What other program would dare to replace the shots of its stars in the opening credits with images of an unknown bit player?  Superstar features Jonathan, repressed nerd of Seasons 1-3, who enacts a spell that makes him the center of the universe.  Cleverly, this spell even affects the show itself, as Jonathan takes over the opening credits, as well.  Gradually Buffy and her friends figure out something's amiss, and must end the spell.  Unsurprisingly, this episode went over the heads of Buffy fans, most of whom apparently can't see a clever parody when it hits them on the head (as in Season 3's flawless The Zeppo).

3. Restless - Another Whedon written-and-directed affair, Restless is also frowned upon by many Buffy fans.  Again, ignore their shallow-minded criticisms.  Restless is a purposely anticlimactic end to the season, a look into the dreams of our main characters.  Willfully bizarre and surreal, it's an hour of TV unlike any other.  It doesn't hurt that it features a spot-on parody of Apocalypse Now, my all-time favorite film.  I like this episode a lot; it's a close second to Hush.

4. This Year's Girl/Who Are You - Cheating here, but this two-parter is really one long episode.  Faith awakens from her coma and promptly switches bodies with Buffy.  Watching Gellar portray Faith portraying Buffy is one of the more entertaining sequences in the show's history.  These two episodes deal with the Buffy/Faith dynamic better than the entire plot arc of Season 3.

Season 4  of Buffy is superb entertainment.  The DVD is the best in the series yet, filled with several commentaries and features.  Audio and video quality are great; however, unlike the European release of Season 4, the set is not in widescreen.  This is unfortunate, as several of these episodes scream to be seen in widescreen, particularly ""Hush.""  The reason they're fullscreen is because Joss Whedon has always intended them to be seen that way.  As he is the creator of this show, one has to respect his decision, but really, in this age of HDTV and widescreen monitors, a fullscreen release could be a kiss of death.  I have a feeling the day may come when these Buffy sets are re-released in the US in anamorphic widescreen.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see.",1120608000,4,8031,4.787063953488372
1260195,4,B000035Z1M,"This was my least favorite Buffy season, but still one you should add to your collection.  Riley was Bufffy's worst bf, Adam was not the ideal villian, and Oz was by far Willow's best lover but it still had it's good side.",1119312000,,222,4.285714285714286
1260196,5,B000035Z1M,"For Buffy's fan, we all see the fourth season is the season with less trauma and sadness. Most characters are funny and witty. Buffy and willow start college.

You get the usual Buffy and scoopy against evil. Buffy has a boyfriend (for a change) .

This is the season that starts in parallel with Angel's first season. Its truly worth the watch. Even if you missed the third season.

Enjoy!",1118966400,,390,4.542857142857143
1260197,4,B000035Z1M,"I can honestly say that Buffy the Vampire Slayer is my favorite TV show of all time. It's the only series of which I have watched EVERY episode in its entirety. I know all of the characters and arcs and I like to think that I could hold my own on any Buffy quiz or match of knowledge. That's why I believe that this season is the weakest in the 7. The Initiative storyline never really impressed me much, and I think that Adam was without a doubt the worst villain ever. An over-analytical demon cyborg isn't much when you consider a master vampire, a lunatic goddess, a powerful wicca with a grudge, or a sly politician with deadly connections.

Also, the addition of Riley to the cast was more of a detriment and a constant annoyance than a help. I realize that Joss Whedon, creator of the series, wanted there to be another love interest besides the incomparable Angel (also a good villain, by the way). And I definitely wasn't pleased when one of my favorite characters, Oz, was dismissed when he and Willow experienced relationship problem.

But, season 4 is not without its delights. The return of Faith is  arguably the best thing about this season. What seems like a desire for vengeance and pain is more of a front to conceal the hurt, loneliness and confusion that dwells beneath the surface. (She was also excellent in the last five episodes of the series, found in season 7). Moreover, the ""Hush"" episode, one of the best  in the total of 144 episodes, creates genuine horror and tension at the idea of silent killers interested in one goal. (Any avid Buffy fan will attest to the fact that Buffy villains are anything but taciturn. Big Bads always come with a mile of dialogue.)

The addition of Anya to the show is also a good thing, and it's cool to see Willow grow into her powers. Spike begins to realize his lack of power when the Initiative has its way with him.

Season 4 is probably the most important season because this is the season in which the structure of the show was challenged. We leave the comfort of Sunnydale High as Buffy and Willow enter college. Xander becomes a regular adult facing questions of worth, and Giles, one of my favorite characters, becomes a ""gentleman of leisure"" due to his dual firing as Watcher and Librarian.

All in all, a must if you intend on collecting all of the episodes, but try and find this box set as cheap as you can. It's definitely not my favorite.",1116892800,4,2416,4.502283105022831

1260199,5,B000035Z1M,"The brainchild of writer Joss Whedon, Buffy The Vampire Slayer originally entered American pop culture as a full-length feature film, starring Kristy Swanson, in 1992. But creator Whedon felt that the project never quite did justice to the full scope of his vision, so he managed turn the film into a television series in 1997. The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series). Yet, the true success for Buffy The Vampire Slayer is indicated by the massive success of the show's long run, strong DVD sales, and the overwhelming success of the series spin-off Angel...

Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the title role of Buffy Anne Summers, a teenage girl who stands alone among her generation as the ""chosen one"" able to ""stand against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer..."" But Buffy is not alone in fulfilling her destiny as a slayer of vampires. She also receives help from the high school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is a Watcher - the one chosen to train and guide slayers on their developmental path. In addition, new friends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan - of American Pie fame) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) quickly uncover the truth of Buffy's destiny, and they often aid her in defending the world against evil forces...

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 4) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Freshman"" in which Buffy moves into her college campus dorm where she's immediately apprehensive about her less-than-comfortable situation (not being accompanied by the Scooby gang). As Giles, Willow, and Xander each go their own way, Buffy realizes that she must confront the evil forces on her own (especially considering there's a band of vampires on her college campus)... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The Harsh Light of Day"" in which Spike returns to Sunnydale in search of the mysterious Gem of Amara (which makes vampires invincible), and ""Something Blue"" in which Willow inadvertently casts a spell which wrecks havoc on all of her friends...

Angel is gone, Riley is in. Fighting, Spike (yes, bleach boy returns with the annoying Harmony), the gentlemen (eeww),Adam, the initiative (a demon miltitary orginization that Riley's part of).

Buffy has changed more from a girl into a woman but still keeping her buffiness. The fact that Cordelia was gone (now with Angel) but to fill up her empty space, Anya returns. The departure of Oz was just heartbreaking but Tara came in to mend Willow's broken heart (yes, Will is gay). Spike is truly hilarious in this season.

1260201,5,B000035Z1M,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Four is about new beginnings; just like the Freshman year of college! Buffy starts out the college year feeling small and insignifigant while Willow is completley into the new scene and is very much in her element. Xander also starts out the season feeling left out of the circle - a townie with college friends.

  Despite the different setting and lack of Angel and Cordelia the season still has its wit and suspense. Romance,however changes alot in the season. Buffy falls for Parker and then Riley, Willow loses Oz, Xander and Anya get together and Giles dates Olivia{a friend from Britian}.

The villians this season are good,too. My favorite is Spike{Yes, he comes back-again} who ends up getting a ""Chip in his head and is unable to harm any living thing! The other villian is Adam, which, when compared to Buffy's other major villians is a 6 on the danger scale.

  This season also contains a great episode -Hush which only has dailouge in the first few minutes and is one of the creepiest EVER shows.

  HIGHLIGHT EPISODES:

BEER BAD- funny with a good message on how to move on and forget past relationships with jerks.

HUSH-creepiest episode

I can see how some viewers might have been turned off by the sci-fi/spy elements that were introduced in this season, but I think they were well done, and they never dominate over the other themes in the show.  The exploration of college life is another intesting new element. Cliques, drinking, fraternity loyalty, the roommate from hell are all incorporated into the ""Buffyverse"" with the appropriate wit.  Instead of rehashing the same stories and situations from seasons 1-3, I'm glad the writers decided to explore some new directions once Buffy graduated high school.

Finally, this season is very well integrated with the first season of Angel, and characters cross back and forth  in a way that I don't think has every been done between two different shows.  I recommend watching Buffy 4 and Angel 1 concurrently, alternating back and forth after each disc.

1260203,5,B000035Z1M,"To most Buffy-fans, the Fourth Season represents the first ""bad"" season of the bunch. But, a word to all those who've never seen the series: ""bad,"" here, is a relative term. It may well be ""bad"" when compared to the Second or the Third Season... but that's like saying that a given mountain is ""short"" next to Everest. There are, really, only a handful of episodes of Buffy that can be described as bad, sans quotation marks, and in truth one or two of those *are* in the Fourth Season. Overall, however, the season is a fine work of storytelling, acting, directing and writing. In the final analysis, Buffy Season 4 is a quality work with a few potholes, but more than enough gems to compensate. You will often hear it said by those who follow this show that the worst of Buffy is on par with the best of most other network TV. And they're right.

The few potholes that do exist here include the worst episode of the series, Where the Wild Things Are, and the admittedly bad episode Beer Bad, which still contains some redeeming moments (i.e. Willow's conversation with Parker). However, the fourth season also has Sarah Michelle Gellar's finest acting work in the series, in Who Are You. It also has the emmy-nominated Hush, the spectacular two-parter The Yoko Factor/Primeval and the best(BEST) and most realistic dream sequence in any filmed medium, Restless.

Also, for anyone philosophically inclined, the Fourth Season presents the strongest and most interesting themes of the series as it pits magic versus science, shows the potential abuse of ""too much freedom"" and reflects on the nature of friendships, to grow apart and come back together again.

With the fourth season, our heroes move from high school to college. The tone and themes of the series mature with the characters. It is, in many ways, a transitional season from the more light-hearted previous few years to the more adult ones to come. This season deals with infidelity, promiscuiousness, substance-abuse, homosexuality and intolerance, but never in a ham-handed or stereotypical way. And it does all of that while remaining a cool, action-packed, tightly-written show. Keep watching--more greatness ahead.",1106438400,,2183,4.975342465753425

1) ADAM - anyway you look at it, it's not the best villain...

2) Angel and Cordelia leaving: Simply did not care. I was tired of that eternal look of boredom in Angel's face, and Cordelia was always mean. She was a real villain and not an integral part of The Scooby Gang like Oz or Anya became, for example. She was saved thousands of times by Buffy and the gang, and even so all she did was show contempt for them.

3)RILEY - ok, a huge controversy arose here, due mainly to the devoted fans of the Angel/Buffy relationship. But he was a good character to introduce The Iniative to the Scooby Gang.

4) SPIKE - James Marsters returns with a bang, decided not to leave anymore! Spike is great, was always great, and this was the beginning of his ""chip in the brain"" saga. Very good plot, very good humor.

5) SARAH MICHELLE - what to say? Professional and talented like always, the perfect actress for the role.

1260207,4,B000035Z1M,"I bought Buffy season 4 with slight trepidation.  I had stopped watching TV after graduating from high school (at the same time as Buffy), and what I'd heard about the latter seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer - a much beloved show from when I watched the second and third seasons in their first run - left me uneasy about seeing more.  But, everyone I knew said that the episode ""Hush"" alone was worth picking up the season for.

Season 4 had the weakest villain up until then:  Adam.  Adam was physically threatening, but he lacked the style of Angelus or the quirks of the Mayor (or even the over-the-top goodness of the Master).  He was a bland, cardboard villain; and indeed, one of the things that the post-high school seasons of Buffy were most sorely missing was the good nemeses.

This was also the biggest time of departure from the series.  David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter went over to Angel, and Buffy seemed to have a hole in it now.  Angel's replacement, Riley Finn (Marc Blucas), was sort of cardboard, and never created a tenth of the magic opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy, natch) that Boreanaz had.  Riley went from a promising character to bland once the spotlight went on him.  Xander's new love interest - the ex-demon Anya - had already been introduced in season 3; her comic obliviousness (""Oh, an orgasm friend?"") and her chemistry with Nicholas Brendon (Xander) carried her through somewhere around late season 5 before she'd gotten uninteresting.  And the popular Oz (Seth Green) went, and was replaced by Tara (Amber Benson) in the show's controversial ""make Willow (Alyson Hannigan) gay"" subplot.  In my opinion, Tara was the best of the new crew; she was sweet and well-written, and Benson is very unconventionally beautiful.

It's hard to knock the cast for this year.  We get a sense of general purposelessness in the male half of Buffy's lead quartet; Xander is a working man whose role as the heart of the Scoobies seems compromised by the end; Giles (the ever superb Anthony Stewart Head) is unemployed and slowly drifting out of his familiar mentor role.  Yet the actors are clearly giving their all, even if this season was the start of the general neglect of Xander that the writers went into over the years.  Willow, whatever the naysayers claim, was exceedingly sweet in her relationship with Tara; Alyson Hannigan handled the transition completely naturally.  And Sarah Michelle Gellar, for all her lack of chemistry with Marc Blucas, continued to find new places emotionally, most notably in her superb performance in ""Who Are You?""

Season 4's overall strength was completely in its episodes away from the rather bland central arc.  The initial sub-arc, settling into college, is decent at best with the exception of the excellent ""Harsh Light of Day,"" which features the return of James Marsters as Spike - who became a regular this season.  ""Beer Bad"" is, well, bad in a way that reminds me of ""Bad Eggs.""  Seth Green's departure in ""Wild at Heart"" makes perfect sense, and is delicately rendered; its repercussions in ""Something Blue"" make for one of the best comic episodes of Buffy.  ""Hush"" - which goes dialogue-free after the first act, and stays that way until the last five minutes - is a singularly brilliant episode, chilling and wonderful and all about communication.  An excellent two-parter brings back rogue slayer Faith in ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Are You?"" (both excellent songs).  When Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Faith and Eliza Dushku plays Buffy in ""Who Are You?"", it is a particularly brilliant turn.  The clever ""Superstar"" rearranges reality from the start for the nerd Jonathan.  ""New Moon Rising"" brings Oz back for one beautiful, sad episode (better than the Initiative arc that runs through it).  ""Restless"" ends the season in a wonderfully rendered suite of dreams.  But not all the standalones are worth it:  ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is saved from being the worst Buffy episode ever only by Tony Head's rendition of ""Behind Blue Eyes.""

The Initiative is far less inspiring.  When the show focuses on its workings or on Riley, or in the overdone action finale of ""Primeval,"" it's entertaining, but it's not the same level as the better parts of the season - much less the heights of earlier seasons.  It's still Buffy, but it's not on the level of the second or third seasons at all.

If ""Hush"" and ""Restless"" - two of the most artful episodes of Buffy - do not merit watching this season, then the comedy of material like ""Something Blue"" and the awesome drama of ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Are You?"" do.  Season 4 works more than many of its detractors would say, even if it's mainly in the standalones and character plots that it goes over well.  And in the final analysis, it's still Buffy - and that means it's still excellent television.",1101772800,7,4834,4.816969696969697
1260208,5,B000035Z1M,"OK. OK. OK. I have turned from a fan into a drooling idiot. Dear God I love this show, and I never saw a single episode on broadcast television. I'm a latecomer who's in the process of devouring the DVD boxes as fast as I can.

Y'know how when somebody from your gang of friends goes away to college, or how that clique you used to pal around with during your last years of high school seems to dissolve a little bit? That's what happens during this season, and it may feel a bit disjointed overall. Sure it's terrific, but fractious as well.

Instead of a Scooby gang per se, Buffy spends a lot of time with her new boyfriend Riley. Xander hooks up with Anya, and lives in his basement. Willow breaks up with Oz and hooks up with Tara. Giles becomes sort of a ""lounge lizard"", neither a librarian nor a Watcher.

It's simply harder for them to just hang out and be together. Many of the episodes either directly or indirectly deal with these ideas...""what has happened to us?"" Consequently the episodes do not flow as nicely from one to the other as the previous seasons. Yet, a number of episodes here are among the best things ever done on the show...one episode in particular ranks among the best hours of TV I've ever SEEN.

Joss Whedon and company truly deserve credit for making art out of a TV show about college and vampires. Again, the dialogue is so sparkling I tend to watch these with the English subtitles running, so I don't miss a syllable.

"" The Freshman"" - 4:1- this is the "" first day of college"" episode. This show captured perfectly that paralyzing doubt, that echoing loneliness, that perpetual feeling of being "" lost"" that every freshman faces. Perhaps I am a bit more sensitive that others, because not only did I certainly have those feelings, I felt them right where Buffy did!  I went to UCLA, albeit arriving in 1982, and seeing the gang go through the same things I did, in the same places I did, brought back, oh, half a cerebrum-full of vivid memories.

4:2 - This is the ""roommate"" episode. The depiction of roommate dynamics was deftly drawn, and pretty much any previous or current dorm denizen will find at least a half-dozen identifiable similarities to their own situation. I was an R.A. for two years; these writers must have been there. I can't tell you how many times I heard that someone has a ""roommate from hell.""  Ha. They had no idea.

4:3 - This is the ""one-night stand"" episode. Again, either these college experiences are universally specific, or the writers were all there while I was. The goings-on of Buffy, Xander and Harmony are painful and precise. (Harmony? Yup. Re-watch the third season finale and it's all clear.)

And give it up for Bif Naked. She's the musical guest of the show. I thought I was the only one who knew about her. In this day and age of Avril Lavigne and Good Charlotte, it's an absolute crime a million or so people didn't pick up her album, "" I Bificus"", from which the show's songs are drawn. It's a better album than either one of those acts has ever made, and mind you, I like those acts. I was thrilled to see her.

4:4 - ""Fear Itself"" - This is the ""haunted house"" episode.  At least one fraternity per college campus must have a combo frat party/haunted house every Halloween. This turns out to be an exquisitely done take on the standard haunted house tale. It's full of honest scares and fun twists. Clichs are destroyed left and right, and even the most jaded viewer will be startled at least once.

4:5 - ""Beer Bad"" - This is the ""I'm so wasted"" episode. The incredible run of wonderful episodes ends with this one. It's hard to watch. I think I can see where they were trying to go, but it didn't. Not even close. Skip it. It pains me to write anything this negative about the show, so I'll just stop...

4:6 - ""Wild At Heart"" - This is an intense little transitional episode. The Oz-Willow relationship reaches a crisis, with the Oz character reaching a logical conclusion and Alyson Hannigan shows why she's an actress deserving Emmy recognition. Those commando-types become more intrusive. The show sort of acts like a set-up for the entire rest of the season. Numerous plot threads are introduced, developed or teased in this one hour.

4:7 -  ""The Initiative"" - This is the ""X-Files"" episode. We are again teased with a bit more information about this clandestine apparently-government-run operation, hidden underneath UCLA....er...UC Sunnydale. Now I know why I never went ""tunneling"" under my alma mater.

4:8 - ""Pangs"" - This is the ""Thanksgiving"" episode. Again, Whedon et al swing for the fences, somehow intertwining the importance of Thanksgiving from a family perspective, the potentially thorny concept of Native American rights, and, of course, demons and such. Toss in a guest appearance by Angel and some truly funny lines from Spike, and we're talking serious entertainment.

4:9 - ""Something Blue"" - This is a Willow-centric episode, where her unrehearsed thoughts become manifest, to hysterical result. I also have to say that Spike can be funnier than pretty much anybody else on the show...his line about the soap opera, ""Passions"" is, as they say, priceless. And the thought of Buffy and Spike getting married should be reason enough to seek out this show. One other point: this being a Willow-ish episode, check out the first scene of the show, and notice the banner Riley is helping hang.

4:10 - ""Hush"" - This is the famed ""silent"" episode. This is, without too much hyperbolic effusion, one of the finest single hours on television. It's not totally silent...maybe 70% or so...but this has some of the most terrifying moments of the series (so far). Those floating gentlemen are creepy as all get out. It also has a pivotal moment for the season...the last combat scene involves Buffy and Riley (although not with each other) and a whopper of a reveal. Again, the dialogue is filled with jeweled bon mots...did you know Giles really wasn't one of the original members of Pink Floyd?

4:11 - ""Doomed"" - This is the ""mini-epic in the middle of the season"" episode. It's the end of the world...yes, again...and the Scooby gang saves it...yes, again. It's the type of show you'd expect at the end of the season, but in typical Whedon fashion, they plop it right smack dab in the middle. Wildly entertaining, and Spike trying to commit suicide is ridiculously funny.

4:12 - ""A New Man"" - This is a ""Giles-centric"" episode, and honestly is one of the more amusing episodes of the whole year. Ethan Rayne returns, Giles becomes a big ugly demon, and Spike helps him out, but only after getting paid a few bucks. Again, Spike steals the show merely by driving a car...

4:13 - ""The I in Team"" - This is the ""Et tu Brutus?"" episode, where Buffy discovers a traitor in her midst. Naturally, the covert operation known as The Initiative must have a super-double-secret-covert operation, which is revealed here.

4:14 - ""Goodbye, Iowa"" - This is a ""Riley-centric"" episode. Buffy and Riley's relationship deepens, and Riley begins to discover some of the Initiative's less-than-noble activities.

4:15 - ""This Year's Girl"" - This episode features the return of...of...nah, I don't think I'll tell. But it's awesome. If you know whom I'm talking about, you'll agree. I'm just not telling for the three or four people out there who DON'T. A real corker of an episode. Part one of two, ending with...

4:16 - ""Who Are You"" - Let's just say one of the most celebrated battles from the last season is revisited here, and it pretty much blows THAT one away. Sarah Michelle Gellar's ability to mimic another character...with posture, walk, voice, inflection...is superb.

4:17 - ""Superstar"" - This is the ""Jonathan"" episode. From the opening teaser and credits...yes, even the credits are altered so don't skip them...this show is seriously demented.

4:18 - ""Where The Wild Things Are"" - This is a combination ""haunted house"" and ""dangers of sex"" episode. Yup. Somehow one leads to the other, as only the denizens and creators of the Buffyverse can demonstrate. As always, little character details flesh out our favorite people, and in this episode, it's Giles. A clue? Who's next?

4:19 - ""New Moon Rising"" - The return of Oz. Here I must mention again that Alyson Hannigan this year has been flat-out amazing. She is, in a word, great. She has plumbed depths that are startling. Her break-up with Oz earlier this year was the most realistic, heart-breaking scene on TV in ages. The highest compliment I can offer is that it felt 100% real. Her emerging sexuality is portrayed honestly and vividly, with a sensitivity and dimensionality unseen in ""normal"" TV shows. This is a performance for the ages.

4:20/21 - The season finale...where the Initiative storylines, the Adam storylines...everything come down to the epic conclusions we've come to expect...

4:22 - except for good old Mr. Whedon. The real last episode, ""Restless"", is an epilogue of sorts presented as a dream state involving all four major characters; it's a ""tone poem"" to use his own words. Based on other reviewers, this single episode sets up the rest of Buffy history or something. I dunno. I'm not there yet. I saw this thing and shrugged my shoulders the whole time. I didn't ""get"" it. I was bewildered.

I have now unwrapped Year Five...I seriously need to catch up on some sleep...",1100131200,7,9358,4.722699386503067

1260211,2,B000035Z1M,"Season Four marks the point where Buffy makes its dramatic turn from a hip, funny and written shown, to a campy, melodramatic and often dumb series. One of the main reasons Buffy becomes such an awful show beginning is season four is that Buffy, Willow and Xander are far less likable as young adults when compared to the high school versions of themselves. The only redeeming point of Season Four is that is was still better then Season Five, Six and Seven.",1098403200,6,458,4.597560975609756
1260212,4,B000035Z1M,"first off, I liked ""Hush"", ""Pangs"", and ""Something Blue"" the best. ""Hush"" because The Gentlemen were wonderfully creepy and the gang were hillarious in their attempts to communicate without the power of speech. (think of the projector scene). ""Pangs"" again, for the hillarity. (Spike with the arrows) and lastly, ""Something Blue"" because of the love spell that caused my two favourite people Buffy and Spike to fall in love! a MUST BUY! but you already knew that..",1098144000,2,464,5.038961038961039
1260213,3,B000035Z1M,"I think it's fair for fans to say that Season Four of ""Buffy"" was the weakest to date and paled somewhat beside the first three seasons. But, the truth is, people are often a little wobbly and weak when they head off to college in real life and I think the show reflected that. ""Buffy"" had to reinvent itself the same way a person has to when they go off to college.

""Buffy"" made a bold choice by having the core characters actually graduate from high school and not stay sixteen forever. Comapre this to another popular teen show, ""90210"", where they were in high school long after the actors themselves got bald spots and wrinkles.

What made this a great show was Joss Whedon's willingness to go in unexpected directions and make strong decisions about the plot and characters. His chief strength, however, was also his main weakness, which is often the case in life. When a bold choice did not pan out, there was an inability to turn the plot line around and change directions before it crashed. This would prove true later in Season Five with Dawn. Adding Dawn to the show wasn't a bad decision, *keeping* Dawn was the bad decision. She really served no purpose for the last two seasons.

This pattern was, unfortunately, set in Season Four with the Iniative and the sudden turn in Willow's love life.

Giving Buffy a human boyfriend was a good idea but Riley, in particular, was not. He shows so much potential in his first few appearnces but after he falls for Buffy, he's like Sampson with a haircut. All the life is drained out of him. Plus, Marc Blucas? Not the best choice as an actor.

The Iniative storyline had potential and I don't think Adam was a poor Big Bad. I think the plot took a wrong turn when Maggie Walsh turned out to be evil. It was predictable and the whole thing got mired down. I do think that the episode where Buffy finally defeats Adam is one of the best in both the season and the series.

Willow ""becoming"" gay was ridiculous, plain and simple. I don't think her attraction to Tara was ridiculous. I think that, given Willow's character, that attraction made sense. Willow spent years pining for Xander and feeling rejected by him. When they did finally get together briefly (in Season Three), their liaison caused real damage to other people. Then, Oz hurts her by turning to vixen Verucca. Willow, twice burned, turns to someone who is an utterly devoted and *submissive* partner and who is more of a geek than even she is. That makes sense for Willow, just as it makes sense for Buffy to want a ""normal"" human guy after Angel. What did not make sense was keeping Tara around on a permanent basis, for one, because she was underdeveloped as a character and boring.

What also did not make sense was the ""Gay now!"" turn Willow's character took. No one really talked about her supposed coming out, they talked *around* it. If they had really talked about it, someone would have directly called Willow on her past relationships. Were the fans suddenly to believe her past feelings for Xander and Oz meant nothing? She wasn't just experimenting, she deeply loved both of them in *every* way. I think that really weakened the life-long bond between Xander and Willow because it made all we knew about them in Seasons 1-3 questionable. I wasn't feeling them again until the ""yellow crayon"" speech at the end of Season Six.

In sum, Season Four has some of the best episodes of the series but this is also, sadly, where the show started its trend of continuing plots and characters past their usefulness.",1097884800,6,3536,4.5927099841521395

After all, that's usually what happens in college. The real theme here is magic vs. science, what with the introduction of Riley and the Initiative. Buffy spends most of her time with Riley, Xander and Anya live in Xander's basement, and Willow falls in love with Tara. Giles feels alienated from the group, so much that he considers leaving in the next season, and eventually does in season 6. Adam wasn't the greatest villian the show ever saw, but he was still interesting. Spike returns as the show's comedic relief. This season probably has some of the worst episodes the show has seen ('Beer Bad' is the worst) but it still makes up for it in classics like 'Restless', 'Hush', and 'Wild at Heart'.",1095897600,,851,4.68
1260216,5,B000035Z1M,"Is all anyone know how to do is piss and moan about this season,you people really are mentally slow aren't you. Josh didn't make this season for the fans,he made it as an introduction to new fans. Joss didn't make this show for inmature whiners who will never forgive him for splitting up Buffy and Angel, nor did he make this show for people who only like horror or vampire shows. Josh has a limitless and profound love for sci-fi, horror, and fantasy in all it's forms. Which is why he made season four the way he did, he even once quoted that it was his favorite season at that point and time(the interview in question took place before seasons 5-7 were made). Season four is a season for the men not the women, anyone that loves a good action movie will find things they like this season. I even got people to start watching the show that swore they never would after showing them the episode primeval. What Joss was trying to do was expand the fan base by trying new and unorthadox things that had never been done before. And I know it worked for me! You see I used to be one of the nay sayers. I thought Buffy was just another Sabrina or a lame spinoff of the original movie which I had seen and didn't like. After seeing the awesome monsters(and yes I liked Adam, kiss my butt if you don't like it), action, and ofcourse the hillarity of Spike who would quickly become my favorite character I was hooked! I suddenly wondered what I had been missing out on! So I went back and watched all the previous seasons and kept watching as seasons 5-7 unfolded. And from the first season to the last I love this show!

Season 1

A brilliant introduction to the world of Buffy and its characters.

Season 2

The season of romance, I dare you to find someone who didn't cry at the end of Becoming part 2. I did and I'm a guy!

Season 3

A nice combination of what made the first two seasons great!

Season 4

A season for the guys! Tons of action, monsters, and special effects! Thank you Joss for realizing that Buffy does have a male fan base!

Season 5

The characters start to grow up and face new challenges in both the real world and the supernatural. Who could ever forget ""The Body"" and ""The Gift""!

Season 6

Probably my least favorite season but thats not a bad thing, thats just Joss being creative and versatile by once again taking the show in a new direction just like with season 4. Our schooby gang is brought to the brink of despair truly testing them.........that plus Dark Willow was awesome!!!!!

Season 7

The final season goes out with a bang or should I say a boom along with the Hellmouth! Yeah I know the potentials were annoying and I wasn't particularly impressed by Caleb but I still liked this season too.

In closing I would just like to say that Joss didn't make this show for any one person or any particular group. He tried to make a show that people of all ages, genders, and demographics could enjoy. Which is why some seasons seem so different or offbeat compared to others, but alas you can't make everyone happy but God bless Joss for trying!",1094947200,2,3075,4.351398601398602

Hush is arugably one of the most original episodes ever. I really liked it. I also love the Yoko Factor where Angel comes for a visit and battles buffy's new boy Riley.

The return of spike and Anya are great and also done to round out the cast. inside antogonist the trade mark of Joss Whedon.

Buffy as usual is looking so hard for a happy ending that she can't find one.  Willow is existing as best as she can and dealing with life at arms length till forced to come to grips with Oz's condition.

riley is a card board cut out, a walking stiff of herman Munster preportions. but in a way he is a rock and what buffy really needs to see her way back to reality. But mostly he's just a rock head.

1260219,4,B000035Z1M,"Spike and Anya two characters always good for a laugh save a season on the brink. By Buffy standards it is a tad weak but by TV standards it is still great.

The bad things about this season are Riley and the Initiative. Riley and Buffy have no spark and absolutely no humor in their relationship. It is what Angel/Buffy turned into near the end of season 3.

Adam wasn't a bad villian overall but he wasn't used well and the writers struggled to give him a real purpose for the season.

Spike gets a chip that stops him from hurting humans and some of the season's best moments involve spike struggling to adjust to his new situation. Anya on the other hand is a former man eating demon who now struggles with her feelings for Xander. They have some great exchanges as Anya rips Xander with her trademark brutal honesty.

Season 4 is not as bad as many would say. It is merely a transistion season which limits it somewhat. Buffy isn't a kid and not yet an adult. It is a strange time and really hard to pinpoint what to write about for a season. Yet the writers do a great job and set the stage for the future of Buffy. Most of Season 5,6,and 7 can be brought back to 4. Spike's journey to redemption starts here. Anya and Xander start for real here. Giles' disillusionment and estrangement begins here. Prophecies of Dawn can be found here. Tara and Willow are in their infancy here.

While not as good as the previous season or the one that follows, Season 4 has a certain charm and heads the show in a new and different direction, which works surprisingly well. The show continues to amaze me with its bravura creativity and amazing plot twists.

For the past three seasons, Buffy has battled the master of all vampires, fallen in love with one (Angel), then killed him when he lost his soul, died herself, was resurrected, met two other slayers, one of whom turned evil on her, and went up against the mayor of Sunnydale, who just so happened to be a giant man-eating demon-snake. She also survived high school, governed by a particularly nasty principal. Now, Buffy Summers must face the biggest challenge of all: getting through college. With Angel moved on to his new show, and Sunnydale High destroyed, Buffy is ready to start a new life, and begins falling for Riley Finn, a hot Teacher's Aid with a dark secret. Willow also falls in love this season, with fellow witch Tara! We also get the return of Spike, who now falls for Buffy, and Faith, who awakens from last season's coma only to switch bodies with Buffy and set her up for murder. Yup, it's like a soap opera, but better: we get lots of violence and cool monsters. Unfortunately, this year's monster, Adam, who bears a striking resemblence to Frankenstein (possible relation) was not the best villian in the show's run, but the storylines of the season were truly addicting and brilliantly set us up for the far superior season 5, and the arrival of Buffy's sister Dawn and goddess Glory. By far, the best episode of the season was the Emmy-nominated ""Hush,"" a creepy and almost dialogue-free episode in which the creepy ""Gentlemen"" rob Sunnydale of its collective voice, and lead Tara into Willow's arms.

The Initiative, of which Buffy's new boyfriend, Riley, turns out to be part of, is a government-sanctioned demon-hunting organization that captures and experiments on the demon population. As she allies herself with the Initiative, Buffy discovers the threat of the mysterious 314 and a villain who unites all the demons of Sunnydale and divides the Scoobies against themselves.
Season 4 marks the return of beloved characters from seasons past, most notably Spike, the snide, leatherclad, chain smoking vampire, who is promptly neutered by the Initiative and forced to depend on the Scoobies for help. Ethan Rayne also returns to turn Giles into a Fyarl demon. And the rogue slayer Faith returns in a brilliantly executed two-part body-switching episode.
While often maligned (including on this website), Adam is, in my opinion, the show's best villain. A charismatic demonoid cyborg, he unites all races of demons and vampires in a quest to create others like him and overrun the earth. A modern update of Frankenstein's monster, he is chilling in his assertion that he is ""aware"". He uses Spike as a pawn to divide and conquer the Scoobies, who he sees as the only true threat to his plan. He knows that without each other, they cannot stop him.
The result is a very interesting spell and an very well-done climactic battle, as well as the prophetic and surreal season finale Restless. It is a fitting end to an awesome season.
Season 4 was an interesting change of pace, and marked the transition out of the familiar setting of Sunnydale High. A very well-done season, definetly among the upper eschelon of the show's achievement.",1088812800,4,2043,5.138138138138138
1260223,5,B000035Z1M,"It is a year that contains some of the show's best-ever episodes (""Hush,"" the two-part return of Faith, ""Superstar"" and the astonishing ""Restless""), and its very worst (two words-- Beer. Bad.).  Narratively, the overall arc is probably the show's weakest, but on a technical level, the show has arguably never looked or sounded better than it does here, as Buffy's secret weapons-- cinematographer extraordinaire Michael Gershman and composer Christophe Beck-- reach new levels of sophistication.  Right off the bat, the show loses three of its most intriguing and popular characters (to spinoffs like ANGEL and movie deals), yet the ensemble acting grows tighter and tighter as the season progresses. College is not always a clean fit, for the characters or the show, but by the end of the season, the stage is set for a two-season arc that will prove to be the show's most difficult, complex and rewarding.

Season Four is the great, big, baggy season of the BuffyVerse, a sprawlingly ambitious and occasionally incoherent year that nevertheless maintains a surprisingly high level of quality throughout.  As the comments above suggest, it is a paradoxical, transitional year, the bridge between the more popular, streamlined high school stories, and the knottier complexities of seasons five and six.  It arrived at the crest of Buffy's popularity and media profile, and to a significant degree, it continues the witty perspective the show developed in season three, but its black DVD casing (and the eerie, Barbie-Doll-in-space expression of Sarah Michelle Gellar on the boxfront) also hints at a creeping darkness that will become more intense as the series progresses.  Not everything in the season works, and some of the elements introduced this year (such as Tara) make more sense as they develop in future seasons, but give the producers credit: just as Buffy finds that she has to adjust to new surroundings, friends, and adventures, the show's creators recognized that, in order to tell stories in this new setting, their style had to change.  In the words of a supporting character on the show's spin-off, ANGEL,  ""High school's over-- time to make with the grown-up talk.""

That ""talk"" would consist of a darker look, full of grays and blues and velvety-rich shadows; a more expressive style of camerawork, with longer takes and flowing tracking shots; a more skillful and fluid integration of pop songs into the storylines; daring editing that, along with the darker storylines and the eerie sets of The Initiative, nudge the show towards the funkier tones of seasons five and six; and, of course, the words.

It's still WhedonSpeak (regardless of who's writing it), full of pop and zing, funny references, slapstick that shifts without warning into tragedy or romance (or both at once), and it's still as generous as ever towards all its characters, but it's stretched here, along with the characters whose adventures it delineates.  It's a bit more melodramatic, occasionally more somber, and even more ambiguous than in previous years. We're not always sure of character motivations, or what certain bits of dialogue mean, we're not always cognizant of why certain plot twists occur, and certainly the finale asks as many questions as it answers. Like a freshman experimenting with lots of styles and viewpoints in her first year, BUFFY Four takes risks, some of which are disastrous (I repeat-- beer. bad. Really, *really* bad), but many of which pay incredibly rich dividends, here and down the road.

Every season of Buffy contains at least one plot twist, but Season Four throws them at its audience like fast-balls: between the final episode of Season Three and the tenth episode of Season Four, the show has made itself over to a significant degree-- still Buffy, but Buffy 2.0.  Since I don't want to spoil any of this for the Season Four newbie, I will try to give a sense of these changes by zeroing in on the character most at sea this year (and, to my mind, the show's best character): Giles. Compared to the tweedy, somewhat imperious Giles of Season One, this one seems adrift, confused-- and very, very funny. Whether answering the door on Halloween in a too-large sombrero, carving into haunted frat houses with a chainsaw, playing ""Hugh Hefner"" (in Buffy's words) with his new girlfriend, or imbibing far more scotch than a watcher really should before battle, Giles (and his real-life alter ego, Anthony Stewart Head) is nothing less than a delight here.  That the show would even keep a high school librarian as a character after graduation speaks to how different BUFFY was from the various teen clones that surrounded it on the WB.  To put it simply, BUFFY was a show about teenage- and adulthood, not a ""teen show."" It could make the transition to a post-high school world in a way that 90210 or DAWSON's CREEK could not because the perspective and voice of its writers-- that of older folks looking back with sympathy and horror-- was far more ironic, generous and complex than those of other shows (it might have filmed on 90210's old high school sets, but it was not stuck on them). It didn't condescend to teens, and while it certianly loved them, didn't feel the need to cater to the prevelent cultural fantasy that life is never better than at 16. Giles fits in here (or rather, is stuck in the same kinds of confusion as the younger characters) because BUFFY chooses to treat all of its characters-- be they a confused young slayer, an unemployed, living-with-parents slacker, a confused werewolf, a sexually ambiguous witch, an ex-vengeance demon, a murderer in a coma, an empty-nesting mother, a grad student supersoldier, an ambitious scientist, an unemployed librarian, or a neutered vampire-- with a respect and well-roundedness that is rare on contemporary television.  Grown-up talk, indeed.",1088035200,3,5843,5.02688728024819
1260224,4,B000035Z1M,"With the first three seasons of the show, the trend seemed to be that Buffy the Vampire Slayer got better after each season. Season one was a good start to the series, season two was amazing, and season three managed to somehow be even better. That is why I had high hopes for season four. It seemed like the show would be in for a nice change of pace with Angel and Cordelia gone, as well as the setting moving from high school to college. Unfortunately, the progress of the show manages to take a step back from the stellar third season. With how good the show would become in seasons 5-7, I would even go as far to say that season four was the show at its weakest.
Season four, had three major downfalls. One of the main reasons why each season seemed to be better than the last was because of an excellent main villan. The first season had The Master, the second season had Angelus, and season three had The Mayor. They all made each season exciting and suspenseful. In season four however, the main villan Adam, was a part machine, part demon, and part human hybrid that provided no charisma at all, and he was quite boring. Season four's second downfall was Buffy's love interest Riley. After watching Buffy's passionate relationship with Angel, there is no way that Riley could complete, and he is probably the most boring character to ever come out of the show. Season four's main downfall would come in the form of a military organization called the Iniative, in which Riley and other soldiers would hunt down monsters. Now instead of Buffy, Willow, Xander, and OZ working together as they did in the past, Buffy becomes a part of the Iniative to work with Riley. The show's best feature is the relationship between the Scooby gang, and season four strayed away from that aspect of the show somewhat.
Now even though season four was argulably the show's weakest season, it was still an enjoyable season to watch. In fact, it does feature some of the show's best episodes in ""Hush"", ""Fear Itself"", ""Something Blue"", ""A New Man"", the return of Faith in ""This Year's Girl""/""Who are You"", ""Primeval"" and the season four finale ""Restless"". The DVD set itself was also very good and was packed full of featurettes and commentary on several episodes. Fans of the show may be slightly dissapointed with the direction of season four, but with some great episodes and a nice DVD set, this is still a must for any fan of the show.
A solid 4 stars...",1088035200,3,2447,4.5636363636363635
1260225,4,B000035Z1M,"Let's get the problem out of the way first... ADAM.  Terrible.  The worst ""big bad"" of all.  The few episodes devoted to Adam and defeating him (only about 3) are terrible.  Adam was not a good villan because he had no attachment to the characters.  He was not really out to get Buffy and had no individual gripe against her.  He was just a machine-demon-man concoction that happened to be around and, therefore, became the big bad.  Boring.
The rest of the season was wonderful.  The show dealt well with the sometimes difficult transition from high school to college with some of its signature humor in ""Living Conditions"" (Buffy's roomate turns out to be a demon) and ""Beer Bad"" (Buffy starts drinking for the first time and learns the rather unusual consequences).  I also enjoyed that the show dealt with the possiblity that others (the government) would know about the vampires and demons and how they would fight them and interact with Buffy.  Riley-Buffy romance was great and more grounded than the Angel-Buffy romance.  The introduction of Tara and Anya as regular characters on the show was a great decision - the relationship among Xander, Willow and Buffy (though I love them!) just isn't enough to sustain the series for this many seasons without some outside intervention.  I also have to say that the decision to make Willow gay was a courageous - and effective - one on the part of the writers.  I even felt like Faith's appearance in Season 4 was effective whereas her long stay in Season 3 was more annoying than anything.  She appeared in Season 4 with a purpose, but her stay in Season 3 seemed aimless and ultimately didn't add anything to the show.
Finally, two of my favorite episodes of all time are in Season 4: ""Hush"" and ""Restless"".  Everyone loves ""Hush"" and so do I.  Its a great episode and just shows how talented the Buffy actors, writers and directors are to have created an hour long episode with only about 10 minutes where the characters can actually talk.  My very favorite episode, though, is ""Restless"" where the First slayer comes to the Scoobies in their sleep to kill them.  The dream-like cinematography and amazingly surreal feeling in the episode is just astounding.  Watch with commentary by Joss Whedon for a litte more insight into the episode.",1086998400,,2293,4.7594936708860756
1260226,5,B000035Z1M,"The first three seasons of Buffy all felt the same in where the characters were, in high school.  From the outside it all looks the same, sophmore, freashman, junior, they are just high school students.  But in the last season, they graduated.
Now we get to see them out of High School.  Willow flourishes in this environment and loves the concept of higher learning.  Oz is back home, with people he played for and partied with in his band.  Xander is trying to find a life for himself, not going to college and not interested he bounces from job to job.  Anya returns and develops a love interest in Xander, considering how they are both outsiders it strangely works.  Buffy is trying to balance her slayers duties with education, and new love interest Riley.  Giles is learning to live without a job as a librarian or watcher status.
It introduces a new group called the initiative, that is a government group experimenting with Demons.
This was a great season, we saw the characters adapting to life outside of high school.  Something I remember not too fondly.  As well as them continuing to change as characters.  Adam was a great big bad, but didn't have enough screen time.  He was obviously a take off of Frankenstein's Monster, but so well done it didn't matter.  As a friend of mine in film school said, if you are going to rip something off, rip off the best.
The only complaints I had about this episode were Spike and Harmony, their scenes were too goofy, even for them.  Though it was interesting to see Spike deal with life after the Initiative peforms surgery on him.
High Points(there are a lot of them)
The Freshman:  Buffy flounders in her new environment.  It is compounded with a vampire gang lead by the defeatist Sunday who wants Buffy dead.
Living Conditions:  Hillarious episode about bad roommates.  Buffy's roommate is strange, but Buffy thinks she is more, her friends think she's overstressed.
Fear Itself:  One of the best Haloween episodes, frat boys use symbols they find in a book to create a haunted house, unfortunately they summon a nasty fear demon that is trying to manifest.
Beer Bad:  Xander is working as a bartender at the college bar, but the beer seems to make people revert to primal states.  Buffy is making cave drawings and smelling her friends hands.
Wild At Heart:  A great episode where Oz encounters another werewolf.  She makes him question what he is and his connection to Willow.
Something Blue:  Willow casts a spell that goes awry; Giles goes blind, Buffy and Spike get engaged, and Xander becomes a demon magnet.
Hush:  Classic episode.  A group of fairy tale monsters comes to sunnydale.  They steal everyones voice so they can't scream when they take your heart.
This Year's Girl:  Faith awakens and she is enraged to find the Mayor dead and Buffy living with a new man.  The mayor left a device that will help her go out with a bang.
Who Are You?:  Sarah Michelle Gellar shows how talanted she is as an actress.  Faith and Buffy have switched bodies, Buffy is mitakenly taken by the Watcher councel and Faith starts settling in Buffies life.
Superstar:  Hillarious episode.  Something is strange as the former class nerd Johnathon returns, but he is a suave near super man.  He is like a well known and respected james bond.  But Buffy has this feeling something is wrong.
Primeval:  Adam reveals his plan.  He wants to start a new race of deomon/human hybrids.  He wants Buffy to be there, but has dark plans for her.
Restless:  An unusual season ender, Buffy and the gang fall alseep while watching movies and have strange dreams where soemthing is chasing them.  A very surreal episode.",1086652800,,3651,4.688188976377953

1260228,4,B000035Z1M,While this season is definetely good in its own way to me it doesn't quite live up to season three. Sure making Willow a lesbian and adding a hunky new love interest definetely help there is just something missing to me. Also sometimes it felt like there was no real evil to address in some episodes so it felt like they were forcing the story along awkwardly. Can't wait to watch season five.,1085875200,,393,4.397260273972603

The addition of Tara was daring and ultimatly rewarding.  Season four also contains the only Emmy nominated episode in the series, the masterful ""Hush"".  The only thing I didn't like was the pointless direction of Spike.  He is much better used in seasons five, six and seven.  Overall, Good stuff.",1085616000,,427,4.626666666666667
1260230,5,B000035Z1M,"Season four of Buffy is an unlucky season that gets bashed far too often for stupid reasons like there's no high school or Angel and Cordelia are gone. The point is things change. Season four does a great job at keeping the greatness even though there are so many changes at once. I'll say that season four isn't as perfect as season three but it does not really feel much worse than season two. The character development is really great at this point. The same can be said of the continuity. Pretty much every episode(except Beer Bad)is entertaining. The best episodes are definitely Hush and Restless. Hush is a silent episode and Restless is a dream episode. Really cool. Even season four haters love these two episodes. Some of the best ideas have come in season four like Willow's lesbianism and Spike's chip. Season four has some annoying flaws,though. The Initiative story arc is anti-climatic and as a it whole feels like it could've been better. Adam,the Big Bad is rather average,too. And Riley is easily the weakest regular character to ever appear on the show. Despite this,season four rules. There are so many great episodes and so many great character moments. It's amazing that Buffy manages to remain so great in a year where it has to deal with so many new things at once. It's a disiorienting season but not in a bad way. Some say season four lacks focus. I think it was intended because of how new and fresh the show is in season four.

1260234,4,B000035Z1M,"Season 4, as some reviewers have pointed out, was the season of change and risk.  If season three was the logical conclusion of the high school is hell metaphor, where evil became institutionalized in the form of the elected Mayor, then season four was the example of the dangers and evils of freedom unrestrained.  This kind of perilous freedom was seen not only in the sexual choices Buffy and Willow both make throughout the season (not so much Willow, but her ralationship with Tara does have to be accounted for in the New Moon Rising episode when Oz returns to Sunnydale), but also in the rogue government organization of the Initiative run by a true mad scientist.  Strangely enough you never see this season mentioned when posters compare the good seasons of Buffy.  The 4th season episodes ran from the near operatic greatness of the end of Season 2 and most of Season 3 (This Year's Girl/Who Are You?-where the loose end of Faith gets tied up, sort of), to sheer put-the-bullet-in-my-head-ASAP woefulness (Beer Bad, A New Man, and what may be the worst episode of the whole series, Where The Wild Things Are). Special mention must be given to Hush, a wonderful homage to silent movies, such as Nosferatu and Caligari.  Unlike the majority of the posters, I felt the story arc for this season was well thought out; science vs. magic was a long overdue theme that looked great on paper, but in execution got bogged down on an episode-to-episode basis by  either really crappy writing or way too zestful character analysis.  The actual action scenes were often gratuitous bones thrown to the viewer to break the often lethal spell of narrative doldrum being cast (the Initiative).  This season, aside from Buffy and Willow's expanded sexual freedom and self pity, saw Giles's character suffer from a lack of direction and decision--arguably he could be the meta-mirror for the Buffy writing staff; Xander, of course, was still Xander.  Spike's character went from Big Bad to sardonic, but he still got the best lines.  There's an awesome pre-credit sequence in one of the earlier episodes where he's talking smack to an unaware Buffy, and then BAM!, gets taken down by Initiative commandos--it's one of the priceless moments of this season.  Adam wasn't such a Big Bad-demon, human, machine, and still a smart ass to boot! There's a great twisted homage to Whale's Frankenstein of 1931 when Adam encounters a boy and gets curious about what makes humans tick.  Indeed this season lacked the epic greatness of the third season, but it also doesn't qualify as completely forgettable season.",1078099200,,2595,4.899543378995434
1260235,5,B000035Z1M,"Season 4 will take some getting used to..Most of the shows on first 2 discs are like that (the exception of 2 episodes)..But hang in there be patient get used to it coz patience will pay off..This season is much darker more bloody more sexual & the comedy is somewhat less then the avarage Buffy fan has come accostumed to in the past seasons..Some people said that with season Buffy sold out and some say that the show just grew up in ways..I know some people who were totally put off with this season..But watching it a second time it became more worth the while..They are no longer at Sunnydale High but in Collage life..And the show reflects that..
  And the first time that Spike returns in the episode ""The Harsh Light Of Day"" it is not the one liner goofy funny villian Spike that we all come to enjoy so much..In most he is more dark and more serious villian..But before that episode ends in a showdown with BuFFy Spike becomes like his old self thankfully.
With all that said keep in mind that the show still packs a punch..Still enjoyable to watch with many highlights..Buffy the vampire slayer always delivers..
  And watch for a character that teases but sad to say there isn't more of she is ""Veruca"" in the episode ""Wild At Heart""..(i don't know who she is but kinda resembles Candice Cameron:) This is a more adult themed show so much so that it freaked out a lot of regular viewers..Including Willow turning gay which brings the debut of her lover ""Tara""..
  Some of the highlights are : the Halloween episode ""Fear Itself"" is more scary then what we are used to when it comes to this show..But the last 5 minutes or so has one of the funniest suprises they ever dished up..""PANGS"" is one that is silly & shows Spike once again in the goofy villian wise cracking fun character that he is supposed to be..Another thing good is it has a political correctness be damned attitude..And what happens to Xander in that episode you will find yourself laughing so hard at something that if for real would be far from funny..And of course the emmy nominated episode ""Hush"" an episode that is basically silent..A task that the cast pull off with overwealmly haunting nightmarish scary results..""Something Blue"" in which a spell gone wrong causes all kinds of hectic hilarity..Spike and Buffy planning a wedding to each other..Now there is a match that one would not exspect..""A New Man"" in which Giles gets turned into a demon..""Where the wild things are"" is a wild example of what i mean by the more adult themes very highly sexual & without a doubt not for kids..""New Moon Rising"" (which ends the Willow and Oz relationship & starts the Willow & Tara relationship)..
Return of Faith double feature ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Are You""..In these episodes you will see some of the greatest ""catfights"" ever seen between Buffy & Faith..
  The Initiative are a commando team that does even more then just hunt vampires and demons they have a underground hidden secret place like Area 51 in Roswell NM..The Initiative takes most of last half of this season..One part of those episodes is a creation that can exsplained as Terminator & Frankenstein. Those episodes are more of a X Files of vibe..And  Lastly for the highlights episodes is the final season 4 episode ""Restless""..To a common viewer they would ask themselves ""when they did this episode did someone lace their scooby snacks and kool aid with LSD""?? That is what this episode seems like..But remember 98% of this episode is dreams of Buffy , Xander , Willow & Giles..Dreams can very well be weird & make no sense..This episode is like they actually filmed the dreams that invaded their nights sleep..Some of the camerawork is truly amazing mostly for the small screen..
And then some are the most fake things you ever seen (like Xander driving the ice cream truck which is the most fake looking driving scene in the history of tv and/or movies)..Check out WiLLow in that ice cream truck...HOT!!!!!! It is a masterpiece beyond the doors of strangeness..And is definatly original..And watch in it too for Giles singing had to be a prelude inspiration for classic musical episode season 6 ""Once more with feeling""..
Giles also sings in 2 other episodes Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Freebird"" & The Who's ""Behind Blue Eyes""..He has classic rock voice that will suprise the viewer..
  Introduction of ""Tara"" a Wiccan friend of Willow who becomes her Lover..So far don't show them kiss..Its more like a tease in this season..
  Loaded with extras..Mostly a extra on 3rd disc that is called ""Spike Me"" a history of Spike..And a behind the scenes of the silent episode ""Hush"" (they must've watched a lot of silent movies to pull off that episode of pure genius)..There are great and fun extras on 3rd dvd and dvd # 6..The extras just keep getting better on these sets..I only have one complaint wish they would show some bloopers from the show..Coz a show like this there should be some set of bloopers maybe on future sets..
  With BuFFy and the ScOObieS Gang you can never go wrong..Just be patient as this season may take getting used to as the show went through changes *but thankfully no change in cast*..Get ready for things you never exsperianced watching this show before..Watch close listen carefully lOOk behind you turn the lights off if you dare..",1077321600,,5304,4.712742980561555
1260236,5,B000035Z1M,"Season Four of Buffy introduces a new environment for the characters that we've grown to love in the first three seasons, but one thing season four is missing is a main location the characters gather.  In the first three seasons, the library was the sanctuary where the characters would gather.  With the new college environment, the library is no longer there and having no sanctuary makes this season seem a little more distant than the past seasons.  This season also marks the first season without Angel, which is a huge hole to be filled.  All these things considered, this season of Buffy has moments of brilliance.  First of all, it contains the episode ""Hush"" which was nominated for an Emmy for best writing.  ""Hush"" alone is worth the purchase of this season.
There are many milestones in this season along with several of my favorite episodes of all time.  There are more character departures and arrivals than any other season of Buffy in this season.  We see the arrival of Spike as a full time member, the arrival of Riley Finn, the arrival of Tara, and the departure of Oz.
There are some wonderful episodes in this season including ""Something Blue"", ""Hush"", ""Superstar"", and ""Restless"".  Another thing season four offers that is incredible, is cross-overs with Angel season one.  It is amazing to watch the two exactly in the order that they were viewed on their original airdates and see the cross-overs.

1260238,5,B000035Z1M,"Buffy season 4 was one of my favorite seasons.  In the aftermath of graduation and the destruction of Sunnydale high, Buffy and Willow move on to college.
Buffy struggles more than ever to juggle slaying and schoolwork.  We are introduced to a number of character this season including Rily, who I hated, as Buffys love interest and a member of a secret govt. run group of soldiers called the Initiative, who do their own demon slaying, and of course Tara who would go onto become Willow's love interest.
Many great self-contained episodes including Beer Bad with Buffy experimenting with Alcohol, ""Living Conditions"" where Buffy has to tolerate an annoying and demonic roommate, and of course, everyones favorite ""Hush""  the much ballyhooed silent episode.
One running plotline is the creation of Adam by the Initiative.  A 1/2 cyborg, 1/2 demon frankenstein like monster.
One of my other faves was the Halloween episode with a great haunted house theme and very scary.
Willow and Xander get much more development in this season as they find new loves.
As usual we get commentary on several episodes including Joss on Hush.  THere are a number of excellent featurettes as well.  Yet another winner.  A great Boxed set!",1073952000,,1219,4.975369458128079
1260239,5,B000035Z1M,"After surviving the battle against the Mayor of Sunnydale, and high school as well, vampire slayer Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her gang of Scoobies embark on an even bigger challenge: college.  Season 4 of Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer saw a transition in the show.  Gone are Angel and Cordelia (David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter respectively; both of whom star in the spin off Angel) and Oz (Seth Green) soon follows after being seduced by a female werewolf.  Soon after that, Willow (Alyson Hannigan, whose character seemed to blossom this season) makes a stunning realization about herself and finds a soulmate in Tara (Amber Benson).  We are also introduced to Buffy's new boyfriend Riley (Marc Blucas); a college student who is a member of the secret government funded Initiative which is experimenting on the demon and vampire population, culminating in evil vampire Spike (James Marsters) receiving a chip in his head which prevents him from harming humans.  In the meantime, the Initiative has created a cybernetic demon/human hybrid called Adam, who soon wreaks plenty of havok, plus Faith (Eliza Dushku) awakens from her coma and switches bodies with Buffy on a great two part episode.  The standout episode of Season 4 is without a doubt ""Hush"", a nearly dialog free episode where the creeped out looking Gentlemen rob Sunnydale of their creative voice and Buffy and Riley come face to face about each other's hidden identities.  Marsters, Blucas, and Benson would end up becoming recurring cast members, as well as Emma Caulfield's Anya (Marsters and Caulfield would remain on the series until it's end), although Blucas' Riley was not well liked at all by many fans of the series.  Despite that though, Season 4 of Buffy was nothing short of phenominal; loaded with expertly paced and surprise filled storytelling, surprising special effects, taut performances, and great comic relief from Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and even Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) made Season 4 one of the best seasons of the series.  However, the best was still yet to come.",1073520000,,2088,5.117647058823529
1260240,5,B000035Z1M,"Too all of you with bad reviews and said the season 4 was weak, should not be called Buffy fans. I can honestly say that through season 1-7, I loved and enjoyed Buffy. There was not one season or episode that I didn't like, ALL WERE GEART!!!. Season 4 was just as good as 2 and 3, in episodes, story-arc, and characters. Please stop talking about Angel and Cordelia living the show like it was the end because you can see them on ""Angel"". I think the show did fine(even better) without them, I think Season 4 showed that, I liked every in this season even ""Beer Bad and ""Where The Wild Things Are"".
  Season 4 had even better episodes then 2 and 3,""Hush"", ""Restless"", ""Who Are You?"", ""This Year's Girl"",""Something Blue"" and more. Also, for the record, I loved Adam and The Initative in Season 4 more the The Master in Season 1. Adam was great, clever and strong villan. He was a killing machine(literally) and had me interested through the whole season.

  Riley as Buffy love interest was different from Angel and I think that what she needed at the time. Xander and Anya have such good chemisy and a funny and cute together. But the highlight couple of the season has to be Willow and Tara. These two witches are a great addition to the Buffyverse and really show a different side in a couple.
  So please you season4-hattas, please shut up!!! this season had no problems and was really great and is as good as the first three seasons. When I see reviews haten' on season 4and 6(which is a dark but another GREAT season) it makes me angry, like I want to punch that person. Each Buffy season is different and new that is why I keep watching. So go buy 4 and 6 when it comes out on July 6 because Buffy never let me down and it shouldn't have let you down.",1072742400,,1757,4.322188449848024
1260241,4,B000035Z1M,"The fourth season saw a lot of changes in both setup and style.  Gone were the familiar halls of Sunnydale High, replaced with new University dorms.  While overall an enjoyable season, the observant viewer will see a show struggling to keep its footing while coping with massive changes.  Naturally, it falters a bit.  The Initiative, in my opinion, is a bit far-fetched, contrived, and boring.  Adam is a disappointing Big Bad (let's face it, nothing will ever compare to Angelus).  What is so upsetting about him is that he could have been a lot more interesting, had the Frankenstein/Prometheus motif been carried deeper and explored more fully.  After gems like The Master, Angelus, and The Mayor, Adam just doesn't cut it.  (Fortunately this trend does not continue - Glory in Season Five is wonderful.)
However, Season Four is not without its charm.  Some of the funniest episodes of Buffy's seven-year run can be found here.  ""Living Conditions"" sees Buffy experience the familiar feeling that her roommate can't possibly be human.  ""Something Blue"" sees what would happen if Willow had her way, and ""Fear, Itself"", the Halloween episode, is absolutely hilarious.
It's not all fun and games, though.  Season Four contains two of the most brilliant episodes of the entire series here, standing tall with some of the highlights of Season 2.  ""Hush"", the emmy-winning episode is almost completely silent - watch it at night in the dark.  It's also possibly the scariest.  The season finale, ""Restless"" is also sheer genius.  It is almost entirely dream sequences, and offers major insights into the main characters, shades of things to come, and some great laughs - it's like watching a European art film... almost.
All in all - Season Four has some wonderful individual episodes to offer - some of the best of the whole series.  The major storyline, with The Initiative and Adam, however, leaves something to be desired.  Definitely still worth the money, though.",1072483200,,1968,5.021604938271605
1260242,4,B000035Z1M,"As Buffy and pals leave High School and prepare to face the exciting world of uh, adulthood?  The show itself shifts in terms of a new school of demon-fighting, centered on the military-operated group the Initiative.  Buffy and the gang find themselves deeply contrasted by the super-tech group, especially when Buffy makes a new love interest in a member of the Initiative, Riley Finn, who joins the show as a regular this season.  Spike, the evil vampire from two years ago, gets his just desserts and is also made a regular when a surprising turn of events happens in hsi life.
A noticeable characteristic of the show is that seasons 1, 3, 5, and 7 all battle outward forces of evil, while season 2, 4, and 6 are more focused on the evil within the groups connections.  While the big evil in this season is the techno-god Adam, its really the betrayal by members of the initiative that cause the most stir for fans of the show.
There are some standout episodes for sure, with yet another one of the greatest Halloween episodes ever, ""Fear, Itself"" where htey get trapped in a haunted house that feeds on fear. ""Something Blue"" shows Willows growing magic skills as a hilarious turn of events happens for just about every character, including a funny subplot with Buffy and Spike that foreshadows events in Seasons 5 and 6. Perhaps the most powerful episode is ""Hush"" which is almost entirely silent the whole show, and was nominated for an emmy.  The two-part episodes with the return of Faith are also exciting and a fun -with devastating consequences- way to show the contrast between the two slayers.  The humor of the show is again exemplified in ""Superstar"" where supergeek recurring guest actor Johnathan foreshadows his part in season 6. The final episode of the season serves as both an epilogue and prologue, supposedly predicting the future of the show, and if you watch it again you will see some hints.  Very avant garde!
All in all this is a good season, lots of action, good twists, and probably the season that sets up the msot for the next three seasons.  The essential theme is sort of about control; losing it, gaining it, who should have control (a theme that comes back in season 7).  Buffys new relationship is very well done, the Willow, Oz, and Tara storyline starts to blossom, while Xander and Anya's feelings for each other also begin to really show.  A good season to help prepare you for the explosive final 3.",1071792000,,2441,4.682242990654205
1260243,5,B000035Z1M,"""The books were too high and then everything was bad.""
 - Buffy to future hubby Riley
Just when you thought Buffy couldn't get any better, it does. The fourth season followed the remaining scoobies (Cordy followed Angel to LA) as they either went to college, or started living in their parents' basement. That's okay Xander, we still love you.
The first episode shows Buffy trying to cope with the bigger world of college, both as a student and a slayer. We get introduced to Riley, the corn-fed Iowa boy (or Kansas, it's hard to remember) and future love interest to Buffy, and we get Spike returning, as cool as ever, as a main character, this time ""neutered"" by a group of mysterious commandos who deal with the supernatural in Sunnydale. Of course, we find that mild-mannered Riley is a veteran member of these army guys, called the Initiative, and that the organization will soon be the breeding grounds for disaster. You mean a situation with trained military personnel and strange beasts where things go horribly wrong? Say it ain't so!
Still, this season is great. Xander and Anya go from being just disturbing to being a genuinely cute couple, and Willow, after losing Oz, finds out that she swings both ways when she meets a fetching fellow witch named Terra. It's really funny that people kept asking and asking whether or not the two where an item, and Whedon eventually had to spell it out on the show. As for Buffy's new flame, you either love him or hate him. Personally, I thought that Buffy dating a normal (relatively speaking) guy was a great turn for the show, and the episode ""Hush,"" where the two learn of the other's secret identity, is simply phenomenal, and more than deserved the Emmy nomination it landed. In addition, we get gems like Faith's brief return to Sunnydale, where she switches bodies with Buffy, as well as a season finale that easily holds its own against the heart wrenching ""Becoming"" and the marvelous ""Graduation Day.""
The villain this time takes the shape of Adam, a man-made (well, technically woman-made) amalgamation of demon, human, and machine. Oh, and he's practically indestructable, along with being about five times as strong as our slayer. He makes for some interesting moments, some chillingly valid philosiphy. Oh, and did I mention that he's practically indestructable? In the end, it takes the entire Scooby gang along with Buffy to take him down, all the while as all manner of hell breaks loose in the Initiative with an all-out war between demons and humanity. Great stuff.
Once again, the extras on the DVD are top-notch. Commentaries, features, cast bios, still galleries, original scripts, and much more, it just makes you want to thank the powers that be for DVD. For Buffy fans, you know you want it. For everyone else, get it anyway. For the sake of puppies and Christmas.",1071360000,6,2841,4.809815950920245
1260244,5,B000035Z1M,"by far the best show in the world to me, its hip, sexy, funny, scary, addicting and dramatic. This season takes place in college and Buffy(Sarah Michelle Gellar), Willow(Alyson hannigan, and OZ(Seth Green) attend. Xander(Nicholas Brendon) is not in college and Giles(Anthony Stewart Head) conducts buisness from his pad. Seth Green who plays the kick ass werewolf Oz, leaves 6 episodes into the fourth season and comes back at the end for 2 episodes. We get to know Spike(James Marsters) more in this season and see how he was kidnapped by The mysterious Initiative, led by Professor Walsh(Lindsay Crouse), and that Buffy's new hubbie Riley Finn(Marc Bluca) is a soldier in that organization. Hush would have to be the best ep in that season and it did win an Emmy. We see the return of Faith(Eliza Dushku) and Jonathan(Danny Strong). Walsh(Crouse) makes an ultimate killing machine, half demon, half human, half of everything named Adam(George Hertzberg)... also theres 2 episodes Angel(David Boreanaz) return to and that episode where Angel kicks the crap outta Riley was cool. Xander gets a new girlfriend, Anya(Emma Caulfield), Willow turns lesbian and has Tara(Amber Benson) and choices her over Oz(Green) but she still thinks about him in her dreams and we see that from the end episode Restless. I've seen every episode more than 5 times and its good because i'm an addictive fan of the show and when it ended in May I was like damnit, hey but theres still Angel and Spike is going and thats the best part, so this is a masterpiece of a show and it'll live in my life forever.",1070236800,,1583,4.845018450184502
1260245,5,B000035Z1M,"The forth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the seaosn before the show took a new direction.  It was the season where it got a breath of fresh air (not being in high school anymore) and the characters became so much more.
Buffy in college at UC Sunmnydale.  The government involvement.  Willow realizing she's a lesbian.  Xander and Anya dateing.  Rylie entering Buffy's life. And ""Hush"" and ""Restless"" in the same season.  All that equals out to one amazing season.
The characters grew up in this season, a season of a change in the winds.
I really want to talk about one episode in particular, ""Restless."" ""Restless"" is the seasons finalie.  It was the one episode that changed everything.  It told of what was to come in the next three seasons and it named Buffy's little sister, Dawn.  It's probably one of the finest hours on televison to ever air.",1068768000,,858,4.629139072847682

1260247,4,B000035Z1M,"The reason I rated this 4 stars is because it wasn't as good as Season 3, but it was still pretty good. I loved the relationship between Xander and Anya as well as Buffy and Riley. It kept the story going. It's great that Spike returned back in this most of the season instead of just one episode during the middle of the season like in Season 3. I seemed to really connect with Alyson Hannigon (Willow) the most in this one because her break-up with Oz was really sad, but when she meets Tara from a group-witch type meeting. Things start to look up for Willow, she starts getting real feelings for her and I really liked the chemistry between them too. I like Oz don't get me wrong, but I like the relationship between Tara and Willow(they are both real witches what more could you want)more. The main story is that Buffy finds a new crush which was Parker, but he's just a guy that got in her pants and left her. Then Riley comes along and Buffy begins to start a relationship. Even though Buffy has know idea Riley is in The Inniative a army group with Professor Walsh that captures demons and performs experiments on them, supposedly implants chips in them so they can't harm humans. As Buffy soon finds out that Riley is in the Inniative she starts to wander that there is more stuff she needs to know like a dangerous experiment in Room 314. Adam, one of Professor Walsh's experiment winds up killing her(Professor Walsh). Buffy starts to have a really hard time trying to go through her relationship with Riley because his army gang are always giving her a hard time. Buffy must battle Adam and she does when Willow, Xander, and Giles come together to perform a spell on Buffy to destroy him. As that's done Riley soon removes the chip Professor Walsh implanted in Riley during the beginning of the Inniative so no more weird outburst from him. And Buffy soon goes through a weird dream after battling Adam with the cheese man and comes face to face with the first ever slayer!

1260248,4,B000035Z1M,"I am a buffy fan through and through. I own Seasons 1-4 on DVD, and when the other three seasons come out, I will buy them too. Season 4 brought a myriad of changes...some of which are good, and some of which are bad. One of the best changes is the Character mix up. While the main four (Buffy, Willow, Giles, Xander) are still intact, the peripherary characters experience a change of the guard. Cordelia and Angel have moved to LA for Career purposes, and Oz ends up leaving 6 episodes into the season. They are replaced by Anya, the blunt ex demon still adjusting to human life, Spike, fresh from him and Drusillas final breakup, and in a bit of a bind, and Tara, a fellow witch with a ""Special"" bond with Willow. Also, there is Riley, Buffys new love interest, and in my opinion, the worst part of Season 4. My favorite episodes of this season are: ""Wild at Heart"" because of the raw emotion and the excellent writing and acting. The woman who plays Veruca makes you hate her, makes you wish she would die, And Alyson Hannigan shines in her most raw period ever...well, for now.
""Hush"" what can I say, everyone who saw this episode loved it. what a novel idea, to tell a story without telling it...
""This Years Girl""/""Who Are You"" these two part episodes bring back Faith, one of the best characters ever in Buffyverse, and totally makes use of the fact that they are mirror images of eachother. Seeing Buffy all ho'ed out is crazy too...
""New Moon Rising"" Another Willow Acts good episode, which totally brings to light the relationship between Tara and Willow, which has been played in the shadows for the past 10 episodes or so.
""Restless"" a character study in Buffyverse. totally focuses on the four main characters. The big bad is dead, and this is a calm before the coming rollercoaster season.
While this was not my personal favorite season, it is definitely not the worst. In terms of a seasonal arc, this is one of the weaker seasons, but episode by episode, this season is unparallelled. almost every episode is totally worth your time. It has incredible effects, and a whole science versus magick thing. I love Alyson Hannigan even more now because of this season, and Emma Caulfield shines in her role as Anya. Also, who doesnt love Spike? It doesnt compare to 2,3,or 6, which are favorite seasons, but its not as bad as say...season 1, which is still good by anybodys standards for tv.",1065052800,3,2402,4.5625
1260249,4,B000035Z1M,"I find it a shame that so many people dismiss season four so easily. This season was a rough transition as anyone can imagine. High school is over, and by the nature of the showm everything had to change. No more library, no more Principal Snyder (a tragic loss, but a necessary one cast wise), and no more central nexus for the plots to take place at. I can understand why some would say the things they do about Season 4...But I cannot agree.
The character development in this season is amazing first and foremost. I point to Willow as the number one example here. I won't provide spoilers, but I dare anyone to deny that season 4 transformed Willow from her high school phase to the Willow we know now. It was a necessary change, and season four was the stage for it. Same with Xander, although we will not see his complete evolution till season five in terms of character, but yet season four sets his depression up, and builds his relationship with Anya at the same time, making sure the character does not slip through the cracks. Giles as well undergoes a radical change, as he is now forced to come to grips with events. These changes and evolutions are what make season 4 the necessary, and vastly underrated, season that it is.
One of the best things about season four is, without a doubt, Spike. Spike replaces the departed Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) as the smart mouth one in the group, and he fills in excellently. Spike's character becomes so endearing that you can not help but wait for the next scene he is in, and you find yourself remembering those scenes the most when you recall an episode here or there. The same can be said for Adam, an underrated villian, that I will admit had more potential then what was given.
Plus when you add, two killer episodes based on Faith and the season three questions left over with her, guest appearances by Angel twice, and the Oz/Willow/Tara mini-arc you have a season that is so plot driven it sometimes overwhelms people used to the usual Buffy. On a side note: the introduction of Tara is another reason this season shines to me.
When you add Hush and Restless to the mix here...Well you really have a jammed packed lineup. Not to mention the extras on this DVD boxset are the best so far on any Buffy or Angel collection. Six commentaries was more then I dared hope for.
Moving on...The Slayer herself is forced to come to grips with things as well. Men, school, slaying, her friends, her family. Her relationship with Riley also plays on all of this with the season arc of the Intiative. No spoilers here, but it is interesting as I get the sense Buffy really fights her own emotions in this season then any other before, including season two and the infamous Angelus arc.
In closing, any true Buffy fan could not be without the collection. Not the best season, but I guarantee it is not the worst either, not by a longshot.",1064275200,7,2889,4.515267175572519
1260250,5,B000035Z1M,"If season three was about the grand story arcs, this season is about the individual episodes.  Unlike season three, where most of the episodes were largely influenced by the multiple storylines (Buffy vs. Faith, the Mayor, Willow and Xander), in this season, most of the episodes are ""stand-alones"" with small bits and pieces of the overall arc.  There are very few episodes that completely deal with the story of the Initiative and Adam.  Speaking of Adam, I believe that he was grossly underused.  Here is this great villain, who is a modern-day Frankenstein's monster who is part man, part demon, and part machine, yet he doesn't show up until the thirteenth episode of the season, and he doesn't do much until the end.  Anyway, this season deals with the Initiative, a secret government-funded organization that captures demons and vampires, then experiments on them.  They are led by Maggie Walsh, Buffy's psych teacher, who we soon learn is up to something.  She is secretly creating Adam, and she plans to create an entire army of these demonoid soldiers.  At the same time, the season deals with the changes that you go through during your first year of college; the old high school gang begins to split up: Oz leaves, Xander does not go to college with Buffy and Willow, Giles starts feeling useless, Willow becomes a lesbian, and Buffy starts spending large amounts of time with her new boyfriend, the Initiative commando Riley Finn.  Spike joins the cast after he gets a chip implanted in his head that makes it impossible for him to harm humans. This season was not without its problems, but to say that it was bad is unfair.  I liked this season a lot (not as much as three, which is considered one of the two best seasons, the other being five), and it was a great transition.  Some things from the previous season finally wound down (Faith in the coma, for instance), and the upcoming season was set up (relationships, and the whole thing about Buffy's new sister was hinted at).  I guess the only problems I had were 1) Oz killed the werewolf Veruca without using silver bullets.  I don't mean to be picky, but I think that they should have honored the mythology.  2) The episode Restless, while interesting, was one of the most bizzare episodes that I've ever seen.  Oh well, enjoy the season.
P.S.
Good episodes include: Fear Itself, Wild At Heart, The Initiative, the Emmy-nominated Hush, Beer Bad, A New Man, This Year's Girl, Who Are You, The Yoko Factor, and Primeval.

1260253,5,B000035Z1M,"Season Four finds the Scooby Gang leaving high school and either heading to college at UC-Sunnydale or the real world.  No single season of BUFFY ever witnessed as many changes as this one did.  Buffy, Willow, and Oz all head off to college, Angel and Cordelia head off to Los Angeles, Giles is no longer a watcher and no longer a librarian and no longer has a sense of what he is supposed to be doing, Xander flounders in a number of horrid jobs until finding his niche in construction, Joyce has to struggle with her daughter being in college, Anya, the former vengeance demon, has to struggle with being a mere human being, and Spike has to adjust to the fact that he is no longer a Big Bad due to a chip in his head that prevents his attacking humans.  As if this were not enough, Oz leaves the show entirely; Willow unexpectedly falls in love with a fellow Wicca, Tara (to bring forth the first convincing and realistic homosexual relationship in television history); and Buffy gets a new boyfriend, Riley, who is probably the least popular character (with the possible exception of Connor in ANGEL) in the Buffyverse.
If you read reviews of the five seasons of BUFFY that have either been released or announced on DVD in the US, you will find people willing to label any of these five as ""the best.""  I think this kind of diversity of opinion is awesome, and it shows how magnificently BUFFY appeals to a huge range of people at a variety of levels.  My own opinion is that Season Four is a bit of a drop off from Seasons Two and Three, and not quite as good as Season Five would be.  Part of the reason it strikes me this was is the enormous amount of change that I alluded to in the first paragraph.  So many things were changing and altering, that my sense is that it all didn't mesh quite as well as in previous seasons.  An additional reason was the unexpected departure of Seth Green to pursue film projects.  Not having Oz around hurt the cast chemistry, and while adding Spike as a core character was a tremendous addition (he and Anya managed to take over Cordelia's role of bluntly saying aloud what others might merely be thinking), Riley is perhaps the lone BUFFY character who simply never meshed with the rest of the cast (I know some feel this way about Dawn, but I always liked her, perhaps because I have a daughter the same age as Dawn).  To top matters off, the Initiative was just a bit too clinical and not sufficiently evil to rank with Angelus of Season Two, or the Mayor in Season Three, or Glory in Season Five.  Adam, the Frankenstein-like creation of Professor Maggie Walsh, was not particularly involving, perhaps because the make up hid most of the actor's face, making him particularly inexpressive.
Nonetheless, BUFFY at not quite at its best is still better than 99.99% of anything else ever done on television, and while the season as a whole may not be quite as strong as others, there are some individual episodes that easily rank among the best in the history of the show.  I have two favorites.  First, the justly celebrated episode ""Hush,"" in which the fairy tale monsters The Gentlemen capture the voices of all the inhabitants of Sunnydale, forcing most of the show to be played out in mime.  The sheer visual imagery of the episode is profoundly unsettling.  The Gentlemen are simultaneously terrifyingly evil, and a parody of obsequiousness.  Bowing in a parody of extreme politeness to one another with macabre grins on their faces, they glide down the streets hovering a foot or so off the ground.  The episode garnered an Emmy nomination, the only one the show ever received for writing, which is utterly absurd when one considers that it is probably the best-written show in the history of television.
My other favorite episode is the second half of the two-parter dealing with Faith's awakening from her coma and her attempt at avenging her near-death at the hands of Buffy.  The first part, ""This Year's Girl,"" is good, but it primarily sets up the extraordinary second part, ""Who Are You?""  In the former, the Mayor, in a videotaped message made before his Ascension, gives faith a device that will allow her to switch bodies with Buffy, which she does at the end of the first part (allowing the eerie opening credits of part two, where it reads:  ""Eliza Dushku as Buffy"").  Body switching has been a staple of television and movies for decades, but BUFFY does something amazing with it.  Primarily, the focus of the episode is an exploration of Faith's sense of self.  We gain insight into her own lack of self and moral focus in the scene immediately after first entering Buffy's body when just after taking a bath she stands in front of a mirror and keeps repeating the words, ""It's wrong!"" in a parody of what she imagines to be Buffy's moral judgmentalism.  Gradually Faith interacts with Buffy's friends and boyfriend, and comes to understand what Buffy has and she lacks:  a strong group of friends who care for her and support her.  This triggers self-doubt about her own worth, and when in the climax she in Buffy's body beats Buffy in hers, the viewer realizes that both the blows and the angry epithets she screams are directed not at Buffy but at herself.  ""Who Are You?"" ends up being one of the most profound episodes of any season.  Upon getting their own bodies back, Faith flees to LA in an attempt to get revenge on Angel instead.  The Angel episodes ""Five by Five"" and ""Sanctuary"" ended the Faith Saga until her return in Season Four of Angel, and her return to Sunnydale in BUFFY's final season.
So, while this is not my favorite season of BUFFY, it is still an enormously entertaining one.  The addition of Spike can hardly be underestimated.  Always a welcome guest in previous seasons, his permanent addition to the cast brought a caustic edge to the humor that definitely lacking after Cordy's departure to LA.  As a whole, the season reflected the growing pains the characters in the show also experienced.  For any BUFFY fan, this is an essential set.",1062892800,4,6032,4.617977528089888
1260254,2,B000035Z1M,"The fourth season of Buffy aired in the 1999-2000 season. It was (with the exception of Angel,) better than anything else that was on that season. It (Buffy) was better than the other television shows that were on but it was lousy in comparison to the three previous seasons of Buffy. It had some good episodes but it didn't have any GREAT episodes. The overall plot of the season was just really weak and the stakes (no pun intended) were just not high enough. Episodes that should have been exciting were dull (the two-part Faith episodes,) and the writing was just silly and stupid at times. Guest stars like Kathy (Buffy's roommate) and Parker (the jerk liar) were just dull and they didn't really seem to have much personality at all. Riley also hurt the show because he came in too soon and he was just not a great choice for a love interest. He was a okay addition but he was dull and lifeless in comparison to Angel and his boy-next-door act was just so wimpy and wholesome that it made him seem like a creepy ""Leave it to Beaver"" character at times. Buffy's future love interest Spike on the other hand, (the excellent James Marsters,) was a great addition to the season. It would have been a lot worse if he were not there. When it is all said and done I would have to say that there are only two good things about Season four:
#1. Spike
#2. Wild at Heart.
Wild at Heart is, without a doubt, one of the most underrated episodes in the history of the series. It is worth seeing because it provides Willow with some future character development and it has a really great seductive villain that makes the idea of becoming a monster almost seem sexy and cool.
I was surprised by the positive reviews this DVD got. I liked the extras but I just really did not like the season. Most of the Buffy fans that I know hate this season as much as I do. I thought it would get one star or two stars from most of the fans that wrote reviews. I am shocked to see how many people think ""Hush"" was a great episode. Hush is one of my least favorite episodes in the series because it too overrated. I can't understand why anyone would say that it was the best episode of the series. It will never compare to the brilliance of ""Surprise,"" ""Innocence,"" or ""Passion"" (episodes from season two) in the end. It lacks the depth and intelligence that the Buffy/Angel stories had. You (those of you that like that episode,) shouldn't say that you like the episode because it is silent. Silent episodes in a series are nothing new. ""Space: Above and Beyond"" and ""Mad About You"" and even the dreadful ""Two Guys a Girl and a Pizza"" did silent episodes before Hush ever aired. The idea is hardly new or innovative.
You should buy this DVD if you are a diehard fan like myself but you should AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE if you are just getting into Buffy for the first time. You should check out the Season two DVD's if you want to see the best episodes in the series. Season four would just be a really painful waste of time and money.",1062806400,8,3011,4.349911190053286
1260255,5,B000035Z1M,buffys gold year the first episode is amazing buffy misses angle so much and imagines him as other men shes taken out of class lives with a weird roomate and has to fight a superstrong vampi5re who beats and breaks her arm the episode should habve been called a bad insted of the freshman great villian adam another strong bad guy tara is a great and mysterious character anya is causing side splitting laughter the demon from part three back shes human shes  so confused and so funny riley is the worst character in the show,1062547200,,525,4.46875
1260256,5,B000035Z1M,"This is one of the best seasons so far.  Hush is a great episode and it is unique in its ability to ""shock"" you.  You know the scene..the dorm room where the helpless guy....no spoiler here!  I like also when Riley is introduced and how Buffy and Riley have no clue on each other's night life.  It seems that Buffy  may have a chance to have a ""normal"" life.... or does it?",1062288000,,373,4.125
1260257,5,B000035Z1M,"The obvious highlight of Buffys' fourth season is ""Hush,"" which features the spine-tingling gentlemen, who rob Sunydale's voice, and mutilates a few people for their hearts.  But they are so many other exceptional moments in this versatile offering from Joss Whedon and his amzing creative team.  The season opener finds Buffy dealing with college life (prothetic now that my older brother is attending Truman State) as well as annoying roommates.  ""Believe"" is a good song but if radio didn't kill it, Summers' roommate did.  The season also marked the arrival of Riley, Buffys' new beau (seeing that her old one went to Los Angeles for his own small screen claim to fame).  Riley keeps a secret from Buffy that he is working for the initiative, a secret government agency experimenting on various demons and ghouls, including vampires.  What Buffy also doesn't know is that the Intitative is creating a super soldier from the remains of perished ones.  The result is Adam (note the biblical reference), a towering, ultra-strong Zombie warrior.  He is a captivating villian, but he can't match the perverse power-lusting of the Mayor from the previous season or the moral chaos that stemmed from Angel turning sour from season two.
However, like it always is with Buffy, the amazing writers infuse the high story-arcs with whip-cracking dialouge, amusing wit and dynamic character development.  Buffy, Xander, Willow, Giles and Oz are taken deeper with each passing frame, although the new additions are not that far behind.  And, as always, Sarah Michelle Gellar is the shows able infrastructure, knowing Buffy inside and out, from her wise cracks and sarcasm, to her deeply penetrating sadness and boiling anger.  Nicholas Brendon continues his run of ""Most Memorable Jokester on Television"" while still deftly building his role.  Alyson Hannigan is impressive as well, showing new dimensions to Willow (a lesbian, who saw that one.  Oh right she called her double ""kinda gay."").  But Anthony Stewart Head is the shows' unsung hero, playing Giles as a man carrying all the emotional weight of a man whose had enough loss in his life to make weaker men buckle under it.  But he carries on, knowing his responsibility to Buffy.
In short, Joss Whedon and everyone involved with this season of Buffy knew the reputation they had to live up to, the fluid consistency that they had shown since Buffy stepped into Sunnydale back in 1996.  Don't feel hesitant to say they passed with flying colors.",1061942400,2,2493,5.04390243902439
1260258,5,B000035Z1M,"A lot of fans & critics claim that this is where the series started to go down-hill. I don't think that is the case. The show simply changed, and some people don't like change. Buffy, Willow, and Oz went off to college. While Xander stayed in his parents' basement and wandered aimlessly from job to job. Lastly, Angel and Cordelia left the show and headed for L.A.
In fact, this season saw two of the series' funniest episodes (""Pangs & ""A New Man"") and two of the series' overall best episodes (the Emmy-Nominated ""Hush"", and ""Restless"", both written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon).
We see the debuts of Tara, Riley; and the returns of Spike, Ethan Rayne, Faith. The main villain for the season, Adam, does not make his first full appearance until episode thirteen, but the debut is worth the wait. Adam is a human/demon/robot hybrid. He is smart, strong, well-spoken, and an interesting villain.
The main arc focuses on The Initiative (a government funded military team who fights and studies demons) and their interaction with Buffy & Adam. Along the way Buffy and Riley get together, Xander and Anya become a couple, and Willow finds someone else after Oz makes his dramatic exit.
The last episode of the season, ""Restless"", is a poignant and unique end to a fun story-arc. We see how the characters have changed throughout their three-and-a-half years by way of their dreams (masterfully written and directed by Whedon).
The commentaries on selected episodes are informative and funny.
Buy this DVD box-set of you are interested in great fiction (just don't buy the upcoming ""Smallville"" box-set, that show is unwatchable)",1061510400,,1641,4.927797833935018
1260259,4,B000035Z1M,"Let's get one thing straight.  Spike is/has been/will always be a minor character.  They tried to get him ""in with buffy"", but that failed.  That is because he complements strong actors like Geller & Boreanaz, but when brought into the forefront, he fails.
This is an amazing season, in spite of Adam & the Initiative which becomes a minor sequence in the whole season.  The characters become the most lovable in this season, especially when they bring Anya in as a full time cast member.
Hush, Something Blue, and the halloween episode stand out brilliantly of course.  But I found when watching the entire season that every single episode had something about it that I loved.  There was an interaction between characters, or a scene where we see quality acting that brings the characters closer to me emotionally, or even a joke uttered that made me laugh out loud.
I highly recommend this season.  Alot of people think the first three seasons were golden and untouchable.  That is somewhat true, but this season still had witty writing, and just wait!!!!....because Season 5 brings in the best villian of them all, with the best season finale (imho).  Bravo Joss & Co.",1061078400,2,1171,4.815
1260260,5,B000035Z1M,"I'll start with the bad news: this is quite probably the worst season of Buffy. However, don't let that stop you; it's still some of the best TV out there. It's a bit disjointed and inconsistent compared to other seasons, and suffers from a less-than-intimidating Big Bad and the massive hole of boring that is Buffy's relationship with corn-fed soldier boy Riley. Still, there's a LOT to love about this season.
In Season Four, Buffy the Vampire Slayer starts college; hooks up with a ""normal"" boyfriend after the disaster that was her last relationship; switches bodies with her arch-nemesis; and finally comes into her own when facing Adam and the First Slayer. Over the course of these 22 episodes, Buffy grows from a girl into a woman, and that might actually be the reason for the disjointedness. Still, I wouldn't have it any other way.
This DVD set contains:
""The Freshman"" - Buffy starts college, but she has a lot of things to adjust to. Classes, dorm life, psychotic teachers, and oh yeah, a sassy vampire named Sunday who's determined to make her life miserable. This episode also introduces Buffy's future love interest, the terminally bland Riley.
""Living Conditions"" - A filler episode, but quite funny. Buffy's roommate Kathy is irritating, to say the least. Labeling her food, clipping her toenails, trying to nab Buffy's could-be-boyfriend...she's certainly bad news. But then Buffy decides that Kathy is evil and therefore must be killed. Surely her friends can stop her before she does anything rash...right?
""Harsh Light of Day"" - Spike (played to perfection by James Marsters) returns to Sunnydale, and at his side is...Harmony? He's in town searching for a magical gem that makes vampires immortal. But he's not the only visitor - Xander's sort-of-ex Anya returns to town, with one purpose on her mind. Meanwhile, Buffy's relationship with Parker Abram heats up...and then dies a nasty death. Continued in the Angel episode ""In the Dark.""
""Fear, Itself"" - Halloween in Sunnydale is never normal, and this year it's marked by a haunted frat house. In which Buffy is a tarted-up Little Red Riding Hood, Willow is Joan of Arc, Xander is 007, and Oz is God. Featuring the debut of Bunny Suit Anya!
""Beer Bad"" - A subpar episode...possibly the worst episode of Buffy EVER. Buffy and some frat boys drink magic beer that regresses them to cavepeople. 'Nuff said.
""Wild at Heart"" - Alyson Hannigan gets to show off her acting chops, as Willow has to face the loss of her boyfriend to a cheating trampy werewolfette named Veruca. Hannigan's portrayal of Willow's misery nearly has me in tears every time I watch this episode. Also, Spike returns only to be zapped by a taser.
""The Initiative"" - In this seminal episode, Riley is revealed to be Agent Finn in a military operation housed underneath the college campus; one led by Buffy's psychology teacher, Maggie Walsh, and which puts a chip in Spike's head to keep him from harming humans.
""Pangs"" - Angel returns! Buffy finds herself fighting the vengeful spirit of a Chumash warrior that gives Xander syphilis and cuts off people's ears. But she's not going to let that stop her from putting on the best Thanksgiving ever, if she has to kill everyone in Sunnydale to do it. Leads in directly to the Angel episode ""I Will Remember You.""
""Something Blue"" - Probably the funniest episode of the season. Willow does a spell to relieve her grief over losing Oz, but it ends up having a few unexpected side effects: Giles is blind, Xander's on the run from demons and Buffy and Spike are engaged!
""Hush"" - The masterpiece of Season Four. A group of (for once, sincerely scary) demons come to town and steal everyone's voices. For almost half an hour, not a word is spoken. It's a testament to the top-caliber acting and writing on this show that the characters still manage to be themselves even without dialogue. Willow's just as sweetly endearing as she scribbles ""Hi Giles"" on her whiteboard, Anya's tactless as ever as she makes an obscene hand gesture to Xander as a subtle hint...""Hush"" is a true work of genius.
""Doomed"" - Now that Buffy and Riley have discovered each other's secret identity, they have to decide whether to report it to their superiors. Meanwhile, Spike is suicidally depressed by having to wear Xander's clothes.
""A New Man"" - Giles' old ""friend"" Ethan Rayne comes to town, and things end up with Giles being turned into a Fyarl demon. With Spike (!) as his only ally, he goes searching for the solution...while Buffy is searching for the monster she thinks has killed Giles.
""The I in Team"" - Buffy starts working for the Initiative, but there's only room for one tough chick here, and Professor Walsh wants to be it. But she'll soon find that she doesn't know what a Slayer is made of...
""Goodbye Iowa"" - With Professor Walsh dead, the Initiative is in disarray. Riley doesn't know who to trust...his friends or his girlfriend. He deals with the situation by going slightly insane (way to go, Riley). But they all soon find they have a much greater menace to deal with...Professor Walsh's ""son"", the Frankensteinian hybrid Adam.
""This Year's Girl"" - Here's where things get REALLY good. Eliza Dushku returns to the series as bad girl Slayer Faith, who awakens from the coma Buffy put her in (in the Season Three finale). She's pure tormented bad-ass, with the climax being an epic fight between the two Slayers with an...unexpected ending.
""Who Are You"" - If anything could top the previous episode, it's this. Buffy and Faith have switched bodies, and the actresses both gamely prove they're up to the challenge. Eliza Dushku manages to play Buffy's earnest innocence quite capably, but the show belongs to Sarah Michelle Gellar as Faith, who's all tousled hair and pouty lips. Watching her mimic Buffy's good-girl mannerisms is alternately chilling and uproarious, and watching her reactions, unused to people treating her like she's their friend, is absolutely heartbreaking. An acting tour-de-force.
""Superstar"" - In this episode, chronic nebbish Jonathan suddenly finds himself the coolest and most capable person in Sunnydale. But when a monster shows up that's apparently connected to Jonathan in some way, does it have something to do with his sudden popularity? (If you know ANYTHING about Sunnydale, you already know the answer.)
""Where the Wild Things Are"" - After a run of such good episodes, here's a sub-mediocre filler episode. Buffy and Riley are trapped in his frat house having endless sex. Yes, it's as appealing as it sounds.
""New Moon Rising"" - Ah, now this is what I'm talking about. Oz returns to Willow, with his beast under control. But as it turns out, Willow's relationship with Tara has gone further than friendship. Which will Willow choose?
""The Yoko Factor"" - It's the blowout we've all been waiting for: Boyfriend vs. Ex! Caveman Brow vs. Corn Boy! In other words, it's time for Angel vs. Riley! Oh yeah, and there's some stuff with Adam getting Spike to divide the Scooby gang from each other as well.
""Primeval"" - Between the teary Scooby reunion, the epic final battle with Adam, and the Matrix-ripoff special effects, this is more of a finale than the actual finale is. But it's all good.
""Restless"" - The season comes to a surreal close in the Whedon-directed and written finale, which takes place in the dreams of Buffy, Willow, Xander and Giles...a fitting end to a season that's quirky at best, uneven at worst. It also lays quite a bit of groundwork for Season Five. Don't miss highlights such as milkmaid Harmony, the Cheeseman, or the Exposition Song!
If you've never seen Buffy, it's probably better to start with Season One or Two. If you're a Buffy fan, you probably already own this. But if you're a casual Buffy watcher, then I think you should give this set a try.",1060992000,3,7803,4.841317365269461
1260261,5,B000035Z1M,Just a quick bit of info for all you videophiles.  This Buffy DVD set has the typical US television 4:3 aspect ratio.  The region 2 DVD uses the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio.

1260262,5,B000035Z1M,"Contrary to popular belief, this is not a bad season. This season is full of good writing and has some of the shows best episodes, such as ""Hush"" (albeit so extremely overrated but still a great episode), the 2 parter ""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Are You?"" that shows Faith's return from her coma, ""The I in Team"", showing Buffy's failed attempt to joined the Intiative, among other's. The only episode I didn't really like was the finale, ""Restless."" It wasn't a bad episode, and it greatly foreshadowed the following season(s), just compared to other finale's it fell short. So all in all, this isn't the greatest season of Buffy, but every single episode is well written and has good story. Adam is by far the worst ""big bad"", but that doesn't mean he's bad.

1260263,5,B000035Z1M,"by far the best show in the world to me, its hip, sexy, funny, scary, addicting and dramatic. This season takes place in college and Buffy(Sarah Michelle Gellar), Willow(Alyson hannigan, and OZ(Seth Green) attend. Xander(Nicholas Brendon) is not in college and Giles(Anthony Stewart Head) conducts buisness from his pad. Seth Green who plays the kick ass werewolf Oz, leaves 6 episodes into the fourth season and comes back at the end for 2 episodes. We get to know Spike(James Marsters) more in this season and see how he was kidnapped by The mysterious Initiative, led by Professor Walsh(Lindsay Crouse), and that Buffy's new hubbie Riley Finn(Marc Bluca) is a soldier in that organization. Hush would have to be the best ep in that season and it did win an Emmy. We see the return of Faith(Eliza Dushku) and Jonathan(Danny Strong). Walsh(Crouse) makes an ultimate killing machine, half demon, half human, half of everything named Adam(George Hertzberg)... also theres 2 episodes Angel(David Boreanaz) return to and that episode where Angel kicks the crap outta Riley was cool. Xander gets a new girlfriend, Anya(Emma Caulfield), Willow turns lesbian and has Tara(Amber Benson) and choices her over Oz(Green) but she still thinks about him in her dreams and we see that from the end episode Restless. I've seen every episode more than 5 times and its good because i'm an addictive fan of the show and when it ended 2 months ago I was like damnit, hey but theres still Angel and Spike is going and thats the best part, so this is a masterpiece of a show and it'll live in my life forever",1059264000,,1588,4.841911764705882

This was a slam dunk season that showed us alot of things.

1260267,5,B000035Z1M,"Season 5 has some of the funniest episodes in the series that I have seen.  Truthfully I think that Riley makes a great love interest for Buffy.  As much as I liked Angel, Riley gives life to the love where Angel just made it bitter sweet.  Oz was not a pivotal character for me so his leaving was not an upset for me.  Anya is a much more likeable character than Cordilia and the show seems a lot more lively with the changes and new additions.  Spike is exceptional, I cannot wait for the sixth season to own Smashed.
Some critics have said Season 4 was horrible.  I went into the viewing with an open mind because I have liked the series so far.  I thought the first episode was a little choppy (Xander was not his 'witty' self) but soon even my skeptical brothers were hooked on the show.  I am looking forward to season 5, as are my brothers who previously made fun of my addiction.",1058572800,,887,4.238095238095238
1260268,5,B000035Z1M,"When Buffy's fourth season aired, I did love it. But it was completely overshadowed by the wonderful fifth season. It began to descend lowly on my list of favorite seasons. Do not get me wrong, every single season of Buffy is intelligent and attention-given, but the fourth didn't thrill me as much. Having not seen the episodes in a long time, and even not watching them in syndication, must have really prepared me for the release of the fourth season because I believe I enjoyed every single second of it even more than I did when all of the episodes premiered on television.
 With Angel and Cordelia off to pursue LA (and David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter, along with Alexis Denisof, to pursue their own show), Buffy's season 4 opens with the gang starting college at UC Sunnydale. Everyone fits in, except for Buffy. She feels small and alone in the big ""new world."" Xander also, after his nearly outside of California roadtrip, feels he doesn't know where he belongs. This is just a minute foreshadowing of the whole theme of season four, and that is growing up and beginning the quest to find where one belongs. Joss Whedon always substituted his monsters as for real life situations, and here he begins to show us real life in the show, just ... with monsters that still were metaphors. Having made that sense of that sentence, I will continue to say that every episode of season four is grand in its own way. Silly stand alones like Beer Bad and Superstar (woo Danny Strong!) were hilarious. Eliza Dushku's 2 episode return caused quite an uproar for the Slayerettes and quite thrilling those episodes were. Joss-directed Hush and Restless were both Emmy worthy, as even Hush was nominated. Although a bit on the off-side, the whole Initiative deal worked. And worked better viewing on the DVD.
 The whole cast once again upped the ante and matured their acting abilities as they matured their characters. Emma Caulfield became a recurring character during season four, and I thank the casting people for making that decision. Marc Blucas as Riley is brought in as Buffy's new love interest, and I was one of the few who liked the character and was ready for something new. James Marsters returns as Spike, and his aura adds a LOT to the show. Also, a great addition was Amber Benson as Tara. Willow and Tara's relationship was handled minorly yet effectively, and in the best way.
 A plethora of commentaries spread across the set, with even Seth Green popping in for one. Many featurettes give us nifty insights to different things such as the characters of Oz and Spike, the music, and one on Hush. The remaining supplemental material satisfied me, and should any fan.
 Buffy's fourth season was one of growing up, and kind of seperating the gang, but in the end with the final two episodes - Primeval and Restless - the core four (Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles) come together and it's the core four that are focused on.",1058486400,,2939,4.723196881091618
1260269,5,B000035Z1M,"Season four had a lot to live up to.  It was coming off what has generally been considering the finest season in the life of the show and it was taking the characters from the known world of high school to the unknown of college.  So much of what had been established in the first three seasons was taken away.  Here are the major changes that we begin the season with: the high school has been burned down, Cordelia has left Sunnydale, Angel (David Boreanaz) has left Sunnydale for L.A., Faith (Eliza Dushku) is in a coma, and the characters have all graduated from high school and are headed to college.  Oh, and Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) quit the Watcher's Council, so Giles(Anthony Stewart Head) is no longer her Watcher.  All of this together is a huge shift in the Buffy universe.  Some people have stated that Season Four is one of the weakest and where the show begins to go downhill.  I disagree.  There were major changes and the lack of a defined story arc towards a big bad villain over the course of the season may be what bothered some people, but Season Four also had huge developments in the characters of Buffy, Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendan), Oz (Seth Green), and even some in Giles.
The season begins with Buffy arriving on campus at UC Sunnydale.  She doesn't quite know where to go, or who to hang out with, or really know anyone other than Willow and Oz, and they seem wrapped up in their personal lives.  She feels alienated (a familiar feeling for a college freshman).  She is trying to find her place both at school and with her friends from high school as she grows up, gains experiences and tries to find who she is, both as a person and as a Slayer.  Willow and Oz go through their own journey and Oz eventually leaves Sunnydale when fears that he can no longer control the wolf inside of him (Oz is a werewolf).  Xander is the one returning member of the Scooby gang who did not attend college, so he finds himself living in his parents' basement and going from job to job.  Somehow, he also finds himself in a relationship with Anya (Emma Caulfield), a former Vengeance Demon, now human.  Anya is a refreshing addition to Scooby gang as she doesn't always quite grasp how to talk to people and she says exactly what she thinks in the most blunt way possible.  Willow begins a friendship based on magic with Tara (Amber Benson), a friendship that we get to watch slowly develop into something more.  The last main relationship to mention is that of Buffy and her new beau Riley.  Riley is a teacher's assistant at college.  He is definitely not a Vampire, but he is quite a bit more than a normal guy.
The major new player in Season Four is a group known as the Initiative.  The Initiative is a secret military operation with the purpose of capturing and experimenting on vampires and demons.  On one hand, their mission of eliminating vampires and demons falls in line with that of the Slayer, but they have other aims that are revealed as the season progresses.  Riley is an officer in the Initiative.  At times Buffy and the Initiative are on the same page, other times they are at odds.  More than halfway through the season we are finally given a glimpse of what would be the main conflict of the year, as far as bad guys go.  However, there is not one single overriding story arc leading to an epic confrontation like in the first three seasons.  This is both the strength and weakness of the season.  In previous seasons we knew that we were leading up to something big.  In season four, we really aren't.  The Big Bad in this season takes a back seat.  The main conflict(s) in Season Four are every day conflicts of life, love, friendship and the experience of being a freshman in college (all the while fighting demons and vampires).  Creator Joss Whedon has said that this season is probably the strongest collection of single episodes in any season of Buffy, but it is viewed as the weakest because it doesn't have the cohesion of having one huge conflict.
The season does have a big final battle, but the season does not end at this episode.  It ends in a rather anti-climactic way (which was the point) in an episode that almost feels like a coda.  We are brought back to the core group (Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles) having a movie night at Buffy's mother's house.  They fall asleep and are assaulted (in their dreams) by the spirit of the very first Slayer.  We get to see the experiences of the characters and how they grow and view themselves and their friends.  It completes the journey undertaken in season four and at the same time it sets up several things that will happen in Season 5.  Near the end of season 3 Buffy has a strange vision about making a bed with Faith and preparing for the coming of someone.  In Season Four, we get more of this and it is said that it is Buffy's little sister.  We also hear the name mentioned for the first time: Dawn.
I have only watched three or four episodes from the remaining three seasons of the show.  All I really know is what is revealed in the first four Seasons on DVD.  I know that this is one of the best shows on television and it is clearly my favorite show.  The writing is clever, witty, and interesting and the stories they tell are human stories with a supernatural twist.  I highly recommend Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but if you are new to the show I would also suggest that you start with Season One.",1058486400,,5433,4.462006079027356
1260270,5,B000035Z1M,"This season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer started out a bit unfocussed, but that's okay.  After all, the characters have all just graduated high school (with a bang) and everyone feels a bit unfocussed at that point in their lives.  I would say that this season is really about that process of forging your own identity once the mantle of high school has been thrown off.  Who are you when you are no longer part of a clique?  What do you do when there is no longer anyone telling you what to do?
Also, if every other episode in this collection were excremental (and that is not true by a loooong shot) then the episode ""Hush"" would be worth the purchase price alone.  This episode is one of the most stylish and clever (not to mention spooky) things I've ever seen on television.  And with all that, it still serves to majorly advance the plot (Joss Whedon, my hat is most sincerely and completely off to you... in fact, I may never wear a hat again).
The transfer on the discs is wonderful, and Joss even includes a personal note to answer all the whiners who are complaining about the DVDs not being widescreen.  I wasn't quite as blown away by the menus as I was for season three, and the ordering of the episodes on the disc menus is not intuitive (maybe they should be numbered or something?).  But this is the only complaint I have.  The special features are getting better, and we have two whole commentaries by Joss (and I could listen to him do commentary on a trip to the grocery store and be entertained).  I'd still like a little more behind the scenes stuff, like maybe some interviews with the cast.  The Spike featurette and Seth Green (Oz) sitting in on one commentary were excellent steps in this direction.
So that's my take on this collection.  Well?  You are a Buffy fan right?  So what are you waiting for?  Buy it already?! ;)",1058227200,,1847,4.423076923076923

I really thought the whole Initiative storyline was pretty weak and don't even get me started on Adam. He's the worst villain ever on Buffy. And I hated the season finale episode Restless. It was soooo boring. The worst way to end a season. No action. It was sort of cool to get into the main character's minds and see their fears, but overall, I was pretty disappointed with it. However, they are still some great episodes. The Harsh Light Of Day was great, mainly because Spike is in it. I also really liked Something Blue, Hush, and the Faith episodes. All in all, I believe, this was the weakest season. The best would go to season 2, 3, and 5",1058054400,,743,4.2027972027972025

This is the strongest series so far when it comes to writing, story telling, character development, philosophical depth and individual episodes.  Though it is the season people stopped watching (blame it on Marc Blucas if you must give someone the blame).  This season was the most lauded so far.  Hush nominated for an Emmy.  Living Conditions, Something Blue, Beer Bad, Superstar, A New Man show how funny the series is when it focuses on comedy and lets drama ride in the back.  But drama comes full swing in The Harsh Light of Day, which made me hate guys and I'm a guy.  The cool season arc conclusion, Primeval...wow!  And Restless which could be the single most important work in television...in visual media.  This is the best episode of the series when it comes to the philosophical depth the show goes in.

Granted many of the episodes are great and clever but the season as a whole is caught in the middle of two exceptional seasons.  The season three 'Buffy' is stellar and the best was yet to come in season five.  In other words season four is the lost middle child.
  The extras and commentaries especially on the creepy, and too good for the season,  masterpiece 'Hush' are worth a 'Buffy' marathon.
  Everything about this DVD set is fantastic and perfect for any fan as a gift or addition to a collection.  The tranfer to DVD is flawless and there is even a nice disclaimer from creator Joss Whedon about the lack of widescreen.

My only gripe is Riley. What a crybaby. The big manly man who can't live with the fact that his tiny girlfriend can kick his whiny butt. The only reason he is tolerable is that I know he leaves next season! That tiny complaint aside I would still give this product 6 out of 5 stars!",1057449600,,459,4.287356321839081
1260276,5,B000035Z1M,"It becomes apparent while watching this handsome DVD package of the Fourth Season of Buffy The Vampire Slayer that the hatred everyone has for these 22 episodes is completely unwarranted.  Season Four was the best season of Buffy because it simply had EVERYTHING (well, except maybe a Xander-centric ep): a movie-worthy arc in the Initiative, a new boyfriend and TWO new girlfriends for the core characters, and a few Angel crossovers and Faith appearances for good measure.  Spike became a regular and Oz left.  There was, quite simply, a whole lot of STUFF going on in Season Four.  What really stands out about this season to me is that not only do the arc-specific episodes work on a level higher than just advancing the season (Goodbye Iowa being a personal favorite), and not only are the stand-alones fantastic (Superstar is as funny as New Moon Rising is heart-breaking), but they all truly fit together as one final work.  We finally get a scary Halloween episode in Fear Itself, a spectacular season finale in Primeval (I thought the folks at Buffy had no money for special effects, but this episode definitely would make you think otherwise), and, mostly importantly, we see Joss Whedon truly come into his own as a director.  He was always the creator, the visionary, the superb writer.  But by this time one would start to think that the episodes he directed were memorable purely because they were pivotal to the story (hey, could any director really get Angel turning evil wrong?).  But, with the final episode Restless, and a little piece of almost disgusting brilliance called Hush, Joss Whedon really came into his own.
And ok, so Adam was kinda lame as a Big Bad.  But you gotta admit that, if nothing else, he was an interesting character.  Tara was much like Oz in that fans went from disliking her to totally loving her.  Spike was still brilliant without becoming too overpowering, as later seasons (especially six) would basically become the Spike Show.  And gosh darnit, Riley was a better boyfriend to Buffy than Angel ever was and you know in your heart that it's true!
What also becomes apparent while experiencing Season Four is that, frankly, Buffy should have ended after this season.  The events of Seasons Five, Six, and Seven would have worked much better as a movie.
The picture quality of this DVD was noticeably clearer and more vibrant than past Buffy DVDs.  The Menus are getting cooler and cooler, although there is still a lack of any real worthwhile mini-docs.  A real treat for this DVD, however, is that we get Seth Green not only in interview clips for the Oz mini-doc but also for a commentary on Wild At Heart.  Sure, Joss Whedon and Marti Noxon tag along, and the commentary is pretty much devoid of any actual worthwhile information, but it's nice to have Seth Green back in any way possible.  Oz was a fan favorite for many, including myself, and it's nice to see him shed some light on his departure.  This also marks the first time an actor has participated in a DVD commentary.  How ironic is it that the actor who left the show was the first one to do so?  C'mon you guys, don't tell me Mr. Green can be making Austin Powers 3 and The Italian Job and still have time to do this but you can't.  Aside from Seth's commentary, I find that, as this DVD series goes on, Jane Espenson gives the most interesting and informative commentaries out of anyone, including Joss.

1260277,4,B000035Z1M,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer has been one of my favorite television programs for quite awhile now and the Fourth season is no exception. As in all television series you'll find a wide variety of episodes, some stories better than others, some written better than others.
With Buffy you alway's get a lot of action, plots & subplots (some of which will be hopelessly confusing if you don't start at the beginning of 1st season), even some weird humor. Most shows, if the story is bad just forget the whole thing with this series almost anyone will find something that's good in every episode.
#4 Fear itself was one weird episode, I didn't really care for except for the ending in which the fearsome demon turns out to be only 6 inches tall (Giles miss read his book caption in which the illustration was described as actual size). while the demon makes his threats Buffy says ""yeah, yeah"", and stomps him, that was one of the most unusual episode endings in the 7 year series run.
#10 Hush was a very different story, actually pretty good, in which The Gentlemen steal everyone's voices in town and then begin killing people for their hearts (I'm not sure what they wanted hearts for), it is almost completely done without dialog. Buffy and Riley each discover that the other has a secret identity when they meet each other in battle with the Gentlemen (nice touch in which Riley misunderstands Buffy's handsignals to destroy the magic containing everyone's voices). The only real weakness I saw in the story is the one in which Riley and chums almost get killed in their voice controlled elevator (which runs from their fraternity house to the secret Initiative base under Sunnydale)only to be shown a sign reading in case of emergency use stairs, you never saw that again.
The Initiative that Riley belongs to is a new plot line for Buffy in which the U.S. Govt. has established a secret underground base for the capture and study of demons, that part is O.K. but it soon gets weird with the addition of the Super evil of the season. Dr. Walsh (who also doubles as Buffy's psych teacher) is head of a Frankenstein type program in which she and others build a warrior out of human, demon, and artificial parts. She names her creation Adam and naturally looses control of him and her life in the process. I could have done without a lot of the Initiative story stuff but I did like the point at which Dr. Walsh ,fearing that Buffy is gaining too much influence over Riley, decides to send her into a trap to be killed (this is son after Buffy joins the Initiative)by some demons under Walsh's control. Buffy survives and sends Walsh a message which Riley sees just as Walsh tells him Buffy is dead,""If you think that's enough to kill me, you really don't know what a Slayer is. Trust me when I say you're gonna find out"".
#21 Primeval is kind of a mixed bag in which Xander gets the idea of giving Buffy a magical boost to fight Adam. The gang breaks into Initiative headquarters and are caught immediately. The base commander is telling them off when Adam releases every demon in the base confinement area. Buffy has told him that ""This is not your business, It's mine. You, The Initiative, the boys at the Pentagon, you're all in way over your heads. You're all messing with primeval forces you have no comprehension of"". He says""And you do"" to which she replies ""I'm the Slayer"" Very nicely done sequence in which magically charged Buffy takes Adam on, you see the fear in his eyes just before she rips his heart out. The closing has a Pentagon review board going over what happened (along with some of the battle), they sufered 40% losses it would've been worse without the civilians.
#22 Restless is the season finale and involves the gang all going to Buffy's house after the battle and relaxing with videos, they all fall asleep and have weird dream experiences as a result of their using magic to help Buffy. This episode has some of the strangest stuff in the whole season in these dreams including Buffy battling the First Slayer, and several hints of what's to come in 5th season.",1057017600,,4087,4.607681755829904
1260278,5,B000035Z1M,"The Man is a Master Story Teller. Simple as that. In my sweeter opinion, he should win ever damn award there is.
Now to the episodes, of my choice:
1. Something Blue. I just adore this truly hilarious masterpiece. I about pissed my pants when we watched it first. Go Spike!
2. Pangs. Ohhh. Loved the line from Spike""don't care if its playing, bloody,'rock the kazbah', just get it out"". and whew, the smirk at the end of the show. Have Mercy!
3. Wild at Heart. Go Oz! You could almost hear....its gonna be a heartache tonite. One of the best sex scenes, I think!
And just for good measure. I liked ""Beer Bad"", & also ""Hush"". We all want more romance/sex/love.  But, I have to say, I did like the Willow/Tara arc. Just wished, that after Tara ,that Xander & Willow, would have gotten back together.  Maybe, just maybe (my fingers crossed really tight) on ""Angel"". Wouldn't that be nice!",1056758400,,885,4.490683229813665
1260279,3,B000035Z1M,"Let me start by saying that I didn't think this season was really bad. I just thought it paled in comparison to the first 3 seasons. While some of the individual episodes were phenomenal, the overall story arc lacked the cohesion that carried the first 3 seasons.
The positive aspects:
1. The development of characters other than Buffy this season was outstanding. Losing Angel was tough on one hand, but on the other, it really allowed for some of the other characters(Spike, Willow) to step up and fill the void.
2. Episodes like ""Hush"" and the two-part Faith crossover remind me of why I love this series so much. Brilliant.
3. The extra features for this season were much better than those in the previous seasons. Some very nice commentary is provided.
And the negative:
1. Adam has to be the worst big bad in all of the show's 7 seasons. He just lacks that personal aspect that makes you want to see him defeated. Ultimately, I didn't care much what happenned to him.
2. The Initiative was pretty hokey. I didn't hate them as badly as some of the reviewers, but I thought it was a bit over the top. I'm in the military myself though, so maybe I'm just being too judgemental.
3. Some of the episodes were just plain bad. ""Beer Bad"" was laughably horrible. I was actually tempted to not finish it after the first half. The episode where Buffy and Riley are going at it in bed the entire time(can't think of the name right off hand) seemed rather pointless and was very redundant to watch. I hated ""Superstar"". Some would disagree with me on this one, but I just didn't care for Jonathan as a character. Finally, I didn't care for ""Restless."" Maybe I just didn't see the artistic vision in it, but it bored the heck out of me, and I thought it was a pretty lame way to end a season.
All in all, season 3 is of high quality, but it doesn't stack up to the other seasons in my opinion.",1056672000,3,1886,4.3914285714285715
1260280,5,B000035Z1M,"Many BUFFY fans say the 4th season with Riley and his initiative is the weakest of the lot,but I agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that that the good stuff outweighs the,um,not so interesting. I,myself,find the iniative thing kinda lacking but,hey,there are great episodes here and the growth of the characters is fun to watch. HUSH is positively creepy in ways BUFFY has never been before. Plus Faith returns to wreak havok. The picture and sound are great,although there is a note from Joss explaining why these episodes aren't in widescreen and apologizes for the crummy episode!.I wonder which one he means?
Oh well,this season is still well worth your time.",1056326400,,676,4.991150442477876
1260281,4,B000035Z1M,"I've always thought that this was Buffy's worst season.  Not that every great show can't have an off year or so, especially when you end up with seasons like 3 and 7 which are just amazing, it's just that this season seemed kinda off.  Between Angel and Cordelia leaving, and Oz leaving like 6 episodes in, the show had to adjust to some major cast changes, and honestly Riley and Anya both sucked horribly this year.
I know that there are lots and lots of people out there who think Willow becoming a lesbian was great for gay pride and feminism, and congratulations to you, but Willow becoming a lesbian has always and will always be my largest problem with the show.  When it first happened it seemed very forced, and it still does.  Yeah, Will was suffering a lot since Oz ditched her and she needed somebody to get close to.  But Tara?  Come on, she is the ugliest wussiest loser ever.  I was so glad when she finally got shot in season 6.  Tara almost ruined the entire show, not by being a lesbian, but by causing the show to do something that made it go ""mainstream"" and show an issue relevant to the real world as opposed to the maid-up world of Sunnydale.  The only thing that saved this show was Spike.
Spike is amazing.  James Marsters puts more humor, heart, and joy into a vampire than anyone ever has.  He's ruthless yet he's forgiving, he's a murderer, yet he's lonely for friends.  And even with that stupid chip in his head, he's still a badass.  Spike, thanks for saving this show and for turning what would have been a humorless dismal seaon into one that is worth watching time and time again simply because of you.  Buy and watch this season for Spike if for no other reason.",1056326400,,1697,4.397435897435898

 the best part of this season is how much the charachters grow. Each of the charachters grow apart from each other during the season, thn come together in the end to kick some butt! Willow is dumped by Oz, leading to some drowning of sorrows. She ends up becoming gay, and encountering Tara, a part of her Wicca group. Xander has an array of different odd jobs, and resides in his parents basement. He rekindles his relationship with Anya, the ex-demon. Giles begins a private life with Olivia, his friend, and deals with no longer being Buffy's watcher. Buffy has trouble adjusting to college, and gets a new boyfriend, Riley.
 Critics didn't like this season and regarded it as incoherent. One reason is that the big villain of the season, demonoid, cyborg ""Adam"" is not introduced until after half of the season has begun. And, Adam's charchter is not developed like the big villain has been in the past with Spike, and the Mayor. But you must see that this season is not about the villain but the journey that these people have taken their freshman year of college. They all did different things, and in the end, ended up together.

Riley's part of a secret military initiative that captures vampires and demons. Willow's b/f Oz leaves Sunydale to find a cure to being a Werewolf. When he's gone Willow discovers that she's into girls and meets a witch named Tara that she starts seeing. Spike is captured by the initiative and a chip is put in his head that keeps him from hurting humans. Faith wakes from her coma and starts right back to having cat-fights with Buffy. She even switches bodies with her and sleeps with Riley in Buffy's body. The villain of the season is a half human half demon half robot named Adam. He was created by the initiative and becomes out of control and only Buffy can stop him.
  The best and most memorable moment of the season is when the Gentleman come to town in the episode Hush.

""  Season 4 was chock full of funny one liners and witty pop culture references, but that didn't seem to be enough for a lot of people.  This was actually one of my favorite seasons.  I love the funny half of Buffy that is sometimes hidden beneath all the killing and darkness of the show.  I loved Riley too and I don't understand you people who didn't like him.  He was a good person with a hot bod who simply wanted to do what was right. What more could you ask for?? I guess most people need drama in their love lives though.  Buffy sure seemed to.  Also some claim that this season doesn't have much of a story arch or whatever, but hello Willow becomes a lesbian, Tara enters the picture bringing lots of magic, Xander and Anya hook up, Spike becomes more involved with the gang whether he wants to or not, and many other things go on if you read between the lines, such as Buffy realizing even though she's the Slayer her powers can't help her with everything, like college.  The Scoobies did drift apart throughout the season, but that happens in life and in the end the original four (Buffy, Willow, Giles, and Xander) come together and remember to love, appreciate, and help each other, as they did when they battled Adam.",1056067200,,1337,4.384615384615385
1260286,4,B000035Z1M,"Originally - I was not a fan of the fourth season, like everyone else, I thought it was a bit different - I never liked Riley as much as angel or spike (not saying I didn't like him - just not as much) - and Adam seemed - well - less tham epic.  But, after seeing it again last week - that is what makes this season really work.  In retrospect I think it is good that the predominate story arc is not apocalyptic.  After the true apocalypse that Angel wanted to bring in season 2, and the assension in season 3 - another season ending fight to save humanity would have been too much.  And the time not spent developing a huge story - was put to good use in expanding the characters - which paid off enormously in season 5.  When you step back and think of how much happens and how many changes occur in this season it is astonishing.  Willow's Story arc - obviously one of the bigger changes - occurs so naturally - that by the time she reveals herself to Buffy - it almost seems amazing that she has not told anyone for so long.  Any other series would have  her character begin her relationship with Tara - and then in the very next episode - there would have been a big coming out sequence.  Instead - Willow only tells her friends when forced to - and even then - the scenes occur in a larger context of Oz's return - and it take weeks before the entire scooby gang is let in.  What makes it so real is there is no true ""coming out"" episode - in fact - you can barely say exactly which episode Tara and Willow become a couple.  The relationship just evolves - like life.
The point being that if their had been a more epic arc - we would not have had time for the detail of Willow's story.  Nor would we have had time for the concentration on Spike, which again - set his character up emotionally in ways that were payed off in season five.
As to Riley . . . he makes sense - and unlike others who didn't like season 4 - I never had a problem with the initiative.  To me it fit perfectly in the Buffy world - it is a standard comic book crossover to have the military come in and attempt to try to undersand the world of magic - and I thought the fit was good - the only thing I felt was the soldiers were a bit too naive to be demon fighters - a little more Nick Fury - a little less GI JOE.
In terms of stand alone episodes - obviously Hush is brilliant.  I cant stop watching it.  Superstar is hillarious - and provides very necessary comic relief when watched in order imediately following the Faith episodes.  It kind of have a feeling that superstar was sort of a test case for season five - to see how the core audience would respond if the entire Buffy world was changed with out any initial explanation - would they be interested in exploring the world untill that explanation was revealed.
The only episode i really do not care for is the second one about Buffy's new roomate.  I know it is a great allegory for the pressures of living with someone new - but in the end - Kathy is just too annoying.  I know that is the point - and the first time i saw the ep i laughed - but after a while - I just can not stand to hear her speak.
But in the end - i highly doubt I'm gonna sway you either way - If you have read this far - you are probably a Buffy fan already and own the darn thing.  But if not - If you are one of thoose peole who don't get many shows in syndication - and so actually haven't seen the episodes but you liked the first three seasons I would definately recomend the season.  Just give it a chance.  I am glad I did.
And anyway 1) Hush alone is worth the price 2) You will be seriously confused if you start up season 5 after skipping season 4 (well - you'll be a bit confused no mattter what with the begining of season 5 - but without 4 you will be even more confused)",1055894400,2,3800,4.0199203187251

1260288,5,B000035Z1M,"Season Four of ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" was definitely a transitional stage for the show. That may be the reason why so many people dislike this season. Gone are the high school days, gone is the privilege of the Scooby Gang always being around each other, gone are two crucial characters Angel and Cordelia, and gone is the hot-spot of discussion -- the library. In is a new campus, in are two new characters Riley and Tara, in is Scooby Gang separation, and in is a new villain. All of these differences can bring down the feel of the show; change is hard. However, one thing I noticed was the arrival of the new big-bad -- Adam. Maybe it's because he's man-made and has no mystical threat, or maybe it's because he's only in the season towards the end. But one thing is for certain, and that is that Adam is not very convincing. One thing about Season Four is that it never gives you that Oh-My-God-It's-The-End-Of-The-World-What-Do-We-Do feeling like seasons one through three. The tone of the season is light and more playful, rather than dark and disastrous. Adam isn't brought in until the end of the season; there is no build up to the climax finale and there are too many filler episodes. All of these things make people turn their noses up to the season. However, Season Four isn't horrible. There are still great episodes, the gang's chemistry is still there, and the humor is ever-so present. Plus, it's still Buffy, and if you're a true fan, you'll accept it like it is and go on.
As for the DVD set, it is great. The color scheme is black (Season One was blue, Two was red, Three was green) and centers on the Emmy-nominated ""Hush."" It folds out six times to reveal six discs. Each has a character photo printed on the front, as well as on the DVD episode menus. There are a bit more special features than the other sets and it is easier to navigate; it gets right to the point. Overall, I think the Season Four DVD set is worth your time and your money. You can take a stroll down Memory Lane with this fabulous season!

That's what so great about Buffy.  Buffy is a human being with human emotions, so she goes through the many decisions and consequences that we all go through.",1055894400,,325,4.551724137931035
1260290,4,B000035Z1M,"As I was watching the final quarter of this season on DVD, I really started to feel the wear and tear in the show's concept and execution. I nearly fell asleep during three of the episodes -- a first in watching this show.
By this time the Buffy character really doesn't hold much fascination for me anymore. Almost all of her issues have been better explored in previous episodes. Her relationship with Riley (Marc Blucas) retreads many of the old themes from Buffy Seasons 1-3: Love stemming from conflict and then comradeship, sex, jealousy, growing pains. Between Angel (in Season 2) and Scott Hope (Season 3), there really wasn't much life left in Buffy's romantic interests. I had almost wished Buffy would really have fallen for an out-there character like Spike; unfortunately, that's not to be.
Even more problematic is that in this season, the writers seem overly concerned with bashing us over the head with Buffy's sex life. Fully a quarter to a third of the episodes here deal with sex, and at a certain point during the third quarter of the season, Buffy acquires a rabbit-like promiscuity dead-ending with the episode ""Where the Wild Things Are"" where Buffy and Riley are in bed, literally, for 30 minutes straight. Very tiring to watch, with not enough character advancement.
Happily, all of the other characters continue to metamorphose. Willow's character takes a turn in this season; Alyson Hannigan portrays Willow's devastating heartbreak and gradual healing deftly, and her blossoming relationship with Tara (a sweet, lovable Amber Benson) is beautiful. Too bad that, possibly due to network squeamishness, Willow and Tara don't even kiss onscreen, despite the great chemistry between them. Nicholas Brendon's Xander and Anthony Stewart Head's Giles both undergo character changes; Brendon has great quirky interactions with gorgeous Emma Caulfield (as Anya, a 1100-year-old former demon), who takes on the role of the blunt, not overly bright, but vibrant sidekick that Charisma Carpenter's Cordelia used to fill. James Marsters finally gets top billing as Spike becomes a recurring role, more as a comic relief than villain. It's about time, though, as Marsters provides that cynical edge and aggressive charisma left void by the departure of David Boreanaz and Eliza Dushku.
Season 4 of Buffy will also be remembered as an experimental period in which the writers and producers admirably took on some very risky narrative experiments which sometimes resulted in sheer magic. The two-part ""This Year's Girl""/""Who Are You"" is a terrific winner where Sarah Michelle Gellar and Eliza Dushku switch characters. Though Gellar isn't completely comfortable with the character of Faith (think Nicolas Cage playing John Travolta's persona in Face/Off), it's still a masterstroke in imaginative plotting, and Dushku's approximations of Gellar's usual mannerisms are simply uncanny. This season's flagship is the famous episode ""Hush"", where all the characters lose their voices to demonic forces, thus depriving the show of its primary weapon, dialogue. The concept is so daring and the sight gags so effective (especially the ""overhead projector"" scene, possibly my favourite scene in the season) that the experiment was a complete success.
This is not the case in other episodes. In fact, as brave and laudable as the narrative experimentation was, most of it resulted in failure. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is basically a 50-minute snorefest, set mostly in the context of a dull, slow-moving house party; even worse is ""Superstar"", which starts out incomprehensibly and never pays off the insufferable first half of the episode, where an inconsequential supporting character (Jonathan, a limp one-note character badly played by Danny Strong) dominates the proceedings. It was a gutsy idea to start ""in medias res"" and eliminate the build-up to the central plot, but the episode doesn't contain enough interest to sustain the strange structure.
But the crowning infamy of this season is the final episode, ""Restless"". After ""Primevil"", an action-packed, slam-bang episode resolving most of the main plots of the season, Joss Whedon deals the ultimate anticlimax with 50 minutes of incoherent, uninteresting, overlong dream sequences that contain no danger, intrigue, or even psychological motivation. I nearly fell asleep three or four times during the episode and I always find that I hadn't missed much. And the ending is a cheap cop-out. This is hands down the worst episode I've ever seen in this show, and the limpest ending possible to a season that, despite certain flaws, is an ambitious, scaled-up reworking of the Buffy concept.
The general quality of the show has gone down by this time. There's still enough good material here to keep me on board; I just hope that the fifth season will achieve a better balance between substance and stylistic experimentation.",1055808000,,4889,5.261203585147247
1260291,5,B000035Z1M,"Having graduating from High school (and blowing it up in the process) the Scoobies now start college. Being a 'fresh new start' in a way, the season resembled the first season in more than one aspect:
1) The season has no specific story arc, and a very small part for a central villain (Adam, the 'evil' behind the Initiative) - much like the Master and his gang of the first season. This led to many unrelated small stories (like 'Super Star' or Emmy nominated 'Hush') that looked into smaller lessons to be learned and followed up some characters from previous seasons (Jonathan, Faith).
2) As Joss mentioned in the Season 4 Overview, this season was mainly about the Scooby gang forming under new conditions - Buffy and Willow move on to college without Xander, Giles is no longer their librerian (or A librerian, for that matter) and has lost a lot of his 'authority figure' aura. A few members are lost (Cordelia, Angel, Oz leaving mid - season), and it's up to core Scoobies to rebuild the team.
3) The season itself has a new 'feel' somehow, with the different setting and the cast changes (Tara introduced, Spike going through an interesting change).
But the show continued to 'grow up' - the big 'blow off' between the Scoobies and Adam & Gang happened in the episode before last, and the last episode was a deeper look at each of the gang members, their fears and streangths, and a question (setting off season 5) about the origins of the Slayers...",1055808000,,1459,4.637065637065637
1260292,4,B000035Z1M,"This was just too far from the Buffy fans had come to love. Though a true fan, such as myself still loves this, we still have our reservations. This Season was the weakest of the show, reason being the lack of a true ""big bad."" Though, if you watch this season faithfully, and truly pay attention, you will come to agree with Whedon's commentary of this set.
Season 4 had an overall evil. Not Adam. But the characters. This season was about emotional growth. Each character had to face himself. That was the true battle. Buffy had to battle herself, had to finally move on, to finally realize that she and Angel were meant to be, but could not be. Willow had to find her true self, had to find that true love trandscends gender. Giles had to finally realize that simply because he was no longer watcher, did not mean that his presence was uneeeded. And Xander had to overcome is fear of being apart of the group, that he was still important. So if you truly watch this season, truly look at it, you may even come to love it more than any of the other season.",1055808000,,1058,4.321608040201005
1260293,5,B000035Z1M,"This season rocked! Only, a little too much Riley in the 2nd half, although it was funny watching Angel beat the ... out that guy!

But As I sit through watching the dvd I am actually surprised that I don't dislike it as much as I did when it first aired.  There where a lot of outstanding episodes in this series of course 'Hush' and New Moon Rising are my favorites even Beer Bad wasn't so bad at all.
Not one of the best seasons out there bec. I'm still partial to

My only real problem with the box set is that that special features arn't all that great. I would have liked to seen more from behind the camra. Maybe even a preview for the next season. How ever i love this show so much i can look past the fact there arn't any reel cool special freatures. The only thing that sucked about this dvd is that it ended and know i have to wait for season five. But all in all i loved this boxset and the idea that soon i will own every episode of Buffy makes me so happy i could turn to dust.,1055635200,,689,3.825174825174825
1260296,4,B000035Z1M,"If you've made it this far in the BUFFY saga you are probably already a fan!  Seasons 1,2 and 3 are really top-notch, and this one is interesting.  Many people criticize it as a transitional season where they had to figure out what to do with Buffy as she and the Scooby gang moved on to higher learning.
Humor does not seem to be lacking as some would suggest.  Harmony, Johnathan, and some really crazy funny episodes seal that deal early on.  We have the return of Spike!  A cameo from Faith and Angel, and even one from Druscilla.  There were some lows, but on the whole it was still a strong show with interesting characters.  And I think the season finale was wonderful with each member of the team really playing a role for once in the vanquishing of the Big Bad - a terminator half-demon named Adam.  And of course you have the excellent silent episode HUSH that almost makes up for anything you find lacking in some of the other episodes.
The DVD is full-frame, and there is even a note from Joss Wheedon saying that is the way it was shot and should be seen.  Odd because other regions list the show presented in widescreen on their releases, but in the end ... this is how the episodes were shown.
Menus mirror the third season.  You get a montage of action, and then a still shot of a character with the episodes around them.  Featurettes this time out concentrate on HUSH, sets, Spike, music, and Oz.  You get a SEASON 4 featurette with spoilers, and more commentaries this time out!  One featuring Seth Green, and one imperative one for RESTLESS from Joss himself.
Basically this set reminds me of Season 3 in quality and presentation.  No meandering menus like season 2, or simple ones like the first.  For fans it's a must-have, and you probably own it already.  For the unitiated it may be one you want to check out the first disc before purchasing.  But Buffy rocks any way you can get her!",1055289600,7,1908,4.436781609195402
1260297,4,B000035Z1M,"The 4th season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER proved to be a matter of transition for both cast and crew.  For one thing, the show had removed itself from the high school setting when Buffy and her gang blew up the school fighting the demonized Mayor in season 3.  Also, David Boreanez's moody vampire-with-a-soul Angel had moved on to his own series, taking with him a major plot point that helped drive the series.  For the most part, BUFFY rebounded quite well with some of the best single episodes on the show to date.  Of particular mention is the classic ""Hush,"" where Sunnydale is under a spell of silence.  Its inventive use of the lack of dialogue just reaffirmed the show's growing reputation as one of the best TV had to offer.  However, there were uneven moments as well.  The ""Big Bad"" of the government-run Initiative was too much of an X-FILES rip-off.  The cyborg-demon Adam lacked the flair of the Mayor or the Master, and commando Riley, despite an ernest portrayal by Marc Blucas, seemed a poor substitute for Angel as Buffy's beau. Also, beloved characters like Giles and Xander were pretty much adrift that season as the college setting put more emphasis on Buffy and Willow.  Overall, though, the season still had its share of entertaining and funny moments, while introducing former villian Spike (the always-solid James Marsters) as an uneasy ally/comic relief. The DVD features, while still on the skimpy side, are upgraded in quality with solid audio commentaries on key episodes including creator Joss Whedon's take on ""Hush,"" with actor Seth Green (the werewolf Oz) joining him in ""Wild at Heart.""  As always, BUFFY still manages to entertain, thrill and provoke its audience, which is a mark of great TV....making this DVD set definitely one worth recommending.",1055289600,,1787,4.906976744186046
1260298,5,B000035Z1M,"Buffy's 4th Season was, until Season 6, the ""scapegoat"" season. That is, the year that everyone could bash on mercilessly without fear of retribution. Between Riley, the Initiative, and ADAM, there was enough for fans to hate. Of course, what it all boiled down to was that Riley wasn't Angel, and the Initiative and ADAM didn't work as well as the villains from Seasons 2 and 3 (possibly the best years of the show). Throw in lots of change (and not necessarily happy change, either), and you get a year everyone hates.
However, Season 4 is still quite good.
The early ""college life"" episodes (""The Freshman"", ""Living Conditions"", and the Parker episodes) are excellent deconstructions of college life, and stand up to the best of the ""high school life"" episodes. The breaking up of the Scoobies works well, although the changes would lead to not-so-good things in the future.
The biggest change (besides the loss of Cordy and Angel) is the addition of Spike. In this year, he's great, serving less of an ally as an enemy forced to help (which he only does grudgingly, at best). Later years would see Spike toe-ing the ""Fonzie line"" between key supporting character and character that takes over the show, though.
Second is, of course, Willow's relationship with Tara (which begins at mid-season) and the revelation that Willow is, in fact, bisexual. (Things would also get ugly when the W/T relationship ended, but that's another story for another time.)
Xander begins dating Anya, and while the ""ignore Xander"" plotline this year works, it'd eventually backfire when the writers began to happily ignore him. And, of course, Buffy ends up with Riley, the normal boyfriend who isn't really normal at all. Other than the maligned Riley, the new additions to the show fill the gap left by David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter (and then some).
The problem, though, is that (as I've implied), the changes that work this year don't necessarily work in future seasons, causing a scapegoating effect on how Season 4 is viewed. (Especially given that the debates about the changes first seen here-debates about Spike, the Buffy/Spike relationship, the neglect of Xander, the shifting of Giles' role in Buffy's life, and the debate as to whether Willow is gay [as she vehemently states after this season on occasion] or bisexual [the answer seemingly backed up with the most evidence] will be fought for years to come.) However, given the quality of the individual episodes and elements of the overall plot, this is selling Season 4 extremely short.
The special features are much more plentiful this time, with commentaries on the most pivotal episodes (including the first-ever appearance by a cast member on a commentary) and a number of featurettes to explore once you've finished watching the episodes themselves. Also of note is the message from Joss Whedon in regards to the fullscreen vs. widescreen debate over the DVD sets, which is hilarious (and sets the record straight that fullscreen Buffy is the way to go). All in all, an excellent release for Buffy fans casual and hardcore alike.",1055289600,3,3090,4.9787234042553195
1260299,5,B000035Z1M,"This season of Buffy is truly magnifecent, but it seems to lack the charm of the first 3 seasons.  Xander has a smaller role, which is a real shame because I thought he was one of the best aspects of the show.  Willow being gay was an unexpected, but not unpleasent shock.  It puts a new and interesting spin on her character.  The villian, Adam, wasn't that great, but how can you follow villians like Angelus or the mayor?  What I did love about the season was the introduction of Spike as a main character.  He makes everything a lot funnier and makes up for the loss of Faith in the naughty humor part of the show.  I also really enjoyed the fact that Harmony is suddenly Spike's girlfriend.  I definetly think this is a valuble addition to any Buffy fan's collection",1055203200,,771,4.380281690140845

Adam was probably my least favorite big bad, Riley was at times irritating, and Oz left. I think, however, the good far outweighs the bad in this season. Some of the funniest and most creative episodes are from season four. Hush, obviously. But also Superstar, Something Blue, and the whole Faith two parter-all inspired. Especially Superstar, which I thought was hilarious mostly because I just had no idea what was going on for the first ten minutes. I loved how they changed the credits for that episode. It was really clever. Restless also encapsulates one of the reasons I love this show. It is constantly hinting and foreshadowing, keeping the viewers engaged by giving us the chance to try to figure out what's going to happen next, and never talking down to us.",1055203200,,873,4.675324675324675

1260302,5,B000035Z1M,"Well I just got Buffy Season 4 yesterday and let me say that it kicks... Seeing that Season 4 was my least favorite season, I wasn't expecting a lot from it but it was a whole lot better than expected. The special features are the best out of all the seasons so far. The season overview is very good and almost as long as an entire episode. Also, seeing that Spike is my favorite character on the show, the whole special feature about him was very cool.
Some more cool things I found was when I read on one of the things inside that season 5 would be coming out in 2003. It didn't say exactly when in 2003 it would be coming out but now I do know that my favorite season is coming out this year. Another of the little inserts on the inside was very cool as well. I read a review on here about someone who was complaining because the dvd's aren't in widescreen. Well for that person and others who are mad about that, Joss has a special insert just for you. It basically says that none of the Buffy seasons are going to be in widescreen because they weren't shot to be shown in widescreen so get over it.
As far as the season goes, I already said that it's my least favorite season of Buffy, though that doesn't mean it's bad. It's still better than Angel Season 1, in my opinion. There are some classic episodes in this season like ""Hush"" and ""Restless"" but I also enjoy watching some of the other episodes like ""Pangs"" and ""The Yoko Factor.""  Buffy season 4 is still better than more than half the shows that are on right now. I definately recommend getting Buffy season 4.",1054944000,,1574,4.246666666666667

1260306,4,B000035Z1M,"Though haled as one of the worst seasons that Joss created, I've learned its not as bad.  I must first right out tell you it took me a while to understand this season and what not. I was in college at the time and didn't see the similarities.  But now stepping back I can really appreciated the genius that is Joss.  Basically season four picks up in the beginning of college for Buffy and friends.  Buffy is struggling with becoming attune with college (and minus Angel from her world as well) life.  It's that first day of school when you're not quite sure.  There is a great view of when she goes into the library and sees how massive it is and feels well lost.  Even though at Sunnydale Buffy wasn't much of a crowd, she always had the school library to fall upon for comfort.  Her roommate is a crazy that she senses isn't something right with her and as time goes on we find out she is a demon.  We are also introduced to Riley Finn, who plays an interesting part in the arc (Inactive, Corn-Breed-Perfect) who falls in nicely to try and fit in as the `normal' boyfriend Buffy has craved for, i.e. not dead.  Though their relationship doesn't sit with many, it does make a lot of sense for the `transitional' relationship you have after a major love is lost.  It's really interesting watching Buffy kind of get lost into it.  Very typical for a girl.  Willow is considered a Wiccan Goddess of smarts; we see the introduction of Tara and the end of a strong relationship of Willow and Oz.  I didn't agree with the whole Willow going Gay, not that I didn't like Tara, but Oz and her were a strong relationship and I see Willow as being more of someone that goes by their soul not by their sex but that is not here now there.  Willow is enjoying being apart of a school were they love the fact she is smart.  It is kind of her element, which throws Buffy off in a way.  Xander, well we see the development of his and Anya's relationship and that... well that is about it.  Xander doesn't have that strong of a role in this year (nor in any other that follow) but his relationship with Anya is very nice.  Giles is struggling to figure out what to do with himself.  He has learned that Buffy no longer needs him as a watcher and feels his role (even father figure role) are not as important anymore.  Spike... you have to just see what happens to him.  Because of the elements that everyone is trying to understand themselves in a more selfish way you could say is how the big bad Adam was able to I guess almost defeat the Scooby Gang.  But hey it's the Scooby gang and you can't defeat them.  I've already said too much, but it's worth seeing for Hush alone and Restless.  There are other ones, and just like any season on Buffy there is also it's not so great one, but you be the judge.",1054598400,5,2790,4.268571428571429

In every other country (UK France Australia etc) Buffy Season 4, 5 and 6 have already been released in true 16:9 format, but not here. What they released was 1/3% of the picture cut off on the left and right. Their excuse for doing this: ""This was the way it was meant to be seen to block out cameras and info that got in the shot."" I've seen both version and BELIEVE ME you're missing a lot! The only camera that got in the shot was in the first episode, where obviously they hadn't mastered it yet, but after that, flawless.
As for the show itself, it's great. The integrity is always there by Joss Whedon, always taking chances with the characters whether fans like it or not. It's a great show, but a LOUSY USA RELEASE!",1054080000,10,839,4.283018867924528
1260310,5,B000035Z1M,"I just checked out a review copy of this DVD set and decided to share my observations here:
After destroying Sunnydale High School in the season three finale, where does Buffy Summers and Scooby member Willow go? The answer is simple - the fictional University of California at Sunnydale.
Already hailed as a phenomenon into its fourth year the adventures of Buffy, Willow and Xander continue with the usual flair and witty dialogue that made the three previous seasons such inspired television. Producer and writer Joss Whedon has created an escapist world filled with engaging characters and entertaining story lines. His risk taking nature is especially evident in season four with the Emmy award winning episode ""Hush.""
As mentioned in one of the many featurettes that litter this six-disc collection, what does Joss Whedon do when he hears it is the dialogue that makes ""Buffy"" such compelling viewing? Why he writes and directs an episode with no lines of dialogue in over 30 minutes - with great results.
Over the course of the 22 episodes that make up season four you will see Buffy battle demons, fairy tale characters, vampires, a cyborg demon named Adam and the mysterious paramilitary organization - The Initiative. She even encounters the first Slayer in the very final episode.
This is certainly a handsome set with the discs housed in the same fold-out packaging as the three previous season sets. A different character portrait is pictured on each of the discs and the start up menu's for the discs also feature a different member of the cast. Curious however is the fact that the character depicted on the cover of the disc does not correspond to that on the main menu. Interesting, but certainly a minor quibble.
Each disc contains four episodes with the exception of discs three and six which contain three. The extra space on these discs is utilized to give Buffy fans a look behind the scenes with several featurettes. Perhaps the best of these is ""Designing Sunnydale"" on disc three where the crew reveal that a field trip to UCLA gave them inspiration for the look of the sets of UC-Sunnydale. They also reveal that a number of the exteriors were actually shot on the UCLA campus. Despite the presence of a number of these featurettes in the middle of the set casual viewers should be warned that they contain a number of spoilers relating to plot points in the latter half of the season.
The major special feature on the sixth disc is the 35 minute ""Season Four Overview"". As the title suggests this is a methodical look at the season, peppered with insightful reflections from a number of the principal actors and crew.
After his conspicuous absence on the Season Three DVDs producer, writer and director Joss Whedon returns with not one but two commentaries. This is a welcome development and (as always) Whedon is an engaging person with whom to share 45 minutes. Both these tracks (for ""Hush"" and ""Restless"") are required listening for fans. Joss Whedon also makes an appearance on a group commentary sharing views of ""Wild at Heart"" with Marti Noxon and actor Seth Green.
Of the three other commentaries the best by far is those provided for  ""This Years Girl"" and ""The Initiative"" by Doug Petrie. Fellow crew member Jane Espenson also shows up for the episode ""Superstar"".
Also included in the set is the original scripts for ""Fear Itself"", ""Hush"", ""Who Are You?"" and ""Restless.""
One major disappointment with the set is the fact that all episodes are presented in full frame. Despite the presence of a small insert with a message from Joss Whedon explaining his preference for full frame, as one who has seen the widescreen transfers of these episodes I have to say that I prefer the widescreen versions.
The picture quality of this set shows a continued improvement over Season Three with strong colors and no sign of niches or scratches. The audio is also impressive with a nice balance and the title sequence fairly booming through the speakers.
All in all, this set is easy to recommend. Although not the best of the ""Buffy"" seasons this is still compelling viewing and great fun.",1054080000,11,4115,4.836879432624113
1260311,2,B000035Z1M,"...Season 4 is considered by fans and critics alike as the worst season of Buffy. Boring plot lines, a boring villian, and even more boring boyfriend. The entire character of Riley alone ruined the entire season. What a whiney, boring, self involved character.
I love all things Buffy. I have all the books from the show, the scripts, the watcher's guides, the first 3 seasons on dvd, the entire rest of the series taped, the soundtrack, the ""once more with feeling"" soundtrack, etc....
...And ""hush""? it is perhaps the most over-rated episode of any tv series in history.",1052870400,5,572,4.846938775510204
1260312,5,B000035Z1M,"I don't really understand why so many people don't like season 4. Oh, wait, I do. Angel is gone and Buffy is still breathing. I think it is really funny that the characters survived high school so much better than some of the fans. Anyway, I don't particularly like Riley, Ok I hate him. But Buffy's love life is the least of what is happening in season 4. This is ground breaking stuff and Joss and all his cohorts deserve big kudos for taking chances. There are some truely outstanding episodes here, Hush, Something Blue just to name two. The whole lesbian relationship between Willow and Tara is handled so beautifully. I agree that as a whole the season is not as strong as the 3 preceding. The whole Initative idea was probably alittle too big to handle. But my gosh, the writing is unbelievable. And besides, you need to have it. Season 4 has alot of clues in it.",1052870400,20,870,4.44375
1260313,5,B000035Z1M,"This was the year of Joss Whedon. After experiencing the highest ratings for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" the show would ever experience in season three, the master of this lore would use 1999 as a year to branch out; with two shows to preach the Buffy mythos. For Buffy, this fourth season was the year that the stakes changed for its core characters. Buffy, Willow and Oz would begin thier pursuit of higher learning, Giles and Xander would experience disillusionment and meandering life choices in thier post-education instiution endeavour and Angel...was gone.
This was the season where the characters and the show was scrambling for a point of reference. The library was no longer available as the rallying point for this gang. Instead, they were scrambling around between Giles' apartment, or Xander's basement, or on campus. This ambiguity was a perfect metaphor for the estrangement that the characters would experience from eachother throughout the season.
This was also, possibly, the last season that the relevance of the characters could be considered relatable to the audience. The trials and fiends that this season offered had some relevence to the ""real-life"" experiences that the characters endured. Often dismissed as misdirected, the fourth season availed a new incarnation for the ""highshcool is hell"" analogy as the evolution from a rather sheltered environment of Sunnydale high to the more cut-throat arena of college was handled well. College is not the place where everyone knows your name and where milestones like graduation or prom would signify the ties between all of the students.
College was the last institution that blocks our characters from the reality of life and the show did well to purvey this sense of isolation and anxiety as we were witness to Buffy's first experience with being ""played"", being intimidated by campus regualars and the overwhelming discomfort of college, friction with a new roommate, binge-drinking, visits back to highschool and drifting apart from her friends.
These elements were very pertinent to myself because Buffy's first year of college, was also my first year of college, and the fourth season was the season in which I became obsessed with the show. Huge character developments were brought about and none more provoking or monumental than Willow's evolution to homosexuality (brilliantly brought about through masterful writing, Alyson Hannigan's performances and the introduction of an equally tremulous Amber Benson). Other developments involved Xander's resignation to the life in the workforce, Giles' defamation professionally and as an influence on Buffy's life, Oz's departure, Anya's return (thank-you writers), Riley's introduction as the rebound-guy, the beginning of Faith's recovery, Angel's not-so-loving reunion with Buffy and who could forget Spike's neurological vasectomy.
When I mean the stakes change, I refer to how Buffy seemingly abandons her friends for some new ones, how Willow and Oz were no longer the perfect couple, how Xander and Giles were on the outside looking in on Willow and Buffy's college life and how a once menacing Spike was strapped in limbo between good and evil. This is the year that the characters left the certainty and comfort of highschool and eachother and joined the cusp of the real world where the institution itself did not tie the characters together, but only created rifts to drive them apart.
Sure, the ""Initiative"" was not as mythological or apocalyptic as villians past, but it was a villian nonetheless that proved a worthy adversary because it was not a familiar type of enemy. I was manufactured and consisted equally of demons and humans. The importance of this season rests in its unfamiliarity. College brought about unfamiliar challenges for the group as did the Initiative and it was in that unfamiliarity that this season was masterful. It was an unfamiliarity that is shared with countless freshmen and that could be relatable. Eventhough college and freshman year is a time that tests your ability to be alone and to adapt to that isolation, it is that isolation that binds the characters together as well as relates the stories to the viewer.
Episodes like ""The Freshmen"", ""Living Conditions"", ""The Harsh Light of Day"", ""Beer Bad"", ""Pangs"" and ""A New Man"" explore the realms of unfamiliarity for the characters as they begin to be divided on issues and challenges that normally they would rally around. As these episodes are largely stand-alone, the episodes pertinent to the season arc also provide exemplary television like ""The Initiative"", ""The ""I"" in Team"", ""Good-bye Iowa"" and ""Primeval"". There were also very stand-out episodes in terms of creativity and artistic potential; these include the emmy-nominated ""Hush"" and ""Restless"" where the writers play with conventions of television and with surrealism.
For those of you who relate to the college anxieties and want to see the evolution and growth for the gang as they approach the real world, I highly recommend this as an addition to you DVD collection. If you long for the good ol' days, however, when the gang was still in highschool and the library was central command, then I definitely recommend this as part of your DVD collection cause ""you don't know what you got til its gone"".",1052006400,30,5289,5.201641266119578
1260314,5,B000035Z1M,"The fourth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a must have! ... single episodes stick out in the must see category. Also, many new characters and relationships first develop from this season such as Buffy and her new muscular boyfriend Riley, Willow and her shy but charming girlfriend Tara, and even Xander with his new (and very very funny!) love interest Anya, the ex-vengences demon. Spike also returns with an interesting turning point. Some of the best episodes for instance ""Hush"" (Where the scary Gentlemen take all of Sunnydale's voices plus Riley and Buffy finally find out some stuff about one another!) and ""Who are you"" (Where Faith comes back in this two-parter episode and switches bodies with Buffy) will leave you on the edge of your seat for sure! Another episode I think was the best ever was ""Restless"" (The lost slayer tries to [destroy] Willow, Giles, Xander, and even Buffy) in this amazing episode which is sure to leave you breathless at the end. Whether you'll be hiding under the covers, passing around tissues, laughing your behind off...the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer--a must have! 5 stars for sure!!

1260315,5,B000035Z1M,"I was dissapointed when I saw that the US will be getting full screen, while the UK has a Widescreen release, until I discovered the reason why.
Joss Whedon (THE MAN) after putting much thought into it, wants the show to be released Full Screen, because thats the way the show was shot and intended.  Yes the Widescreen addition has sides chopped out of the full screen, but this is what Joss and the directors intended while shooting the episodes.  What you see at the sides of the Widescreen was supposed to be chopped off.  And when it comes down to it, this is Joss' show, and this is the way he wants us watching it.
I plan on trusting the US releases, as a lot more work has gone into these additions than any others.  They have more features and (in my opinion) better packaging.
Check official Buffy websites for the quote from Joss, but I'm with him, this is the way the show is intended, this is the way I'll watch it.",1051920000,,928,4.316091954022989
1260316,4,B000035Z1M,"I think Season 4 was an awesome part of the Buffy universe.  We saw Buffy humbled by a snotty group of college vampires, but later kicked their bu-tay...we were introduced to the super sexy Riley (sorry guy, I liked Riley)...we were introduced to the quiet and beautiful Tara and saw the first signs of romance between her and Willow in what has to be the best and scariest episode ever, HUSH...and, to me, we saw the awesome appearance of ""Uber Buffy"" and sad to say it was a one time appearance only.  I won't go on and on, others have given a more in depth review and I don't hold a candle to those guys as a reviewer.
I gave it 4 stars only because of FOX's betrayal to fans by releasing it in fullscreen format and not widescreen as it should be.",1051574400,3,751,4.244755244755245
1260317,5,B000035Z1M,"As most customer reviews have dutifully pointed out, season 4 has always been the sore spot on a good number of Buffy fans' favorite lists. As most, if not all, reviews go on to say, in what could be perceived as an elitist attempt at irony, these fans are wrong. These pleas from naysayers against season 4 naysayers are of course neither elitist nor ironic because season 4 of Buffy is genius in almost every aspect of it and comes intact with several of the show's greatest moments.
The first several episodes of the season strive to regain the ground that the show had lost with the departure of Angel, Cordelia and high school. With teasers throughout each episode impending `The Initiative', we are treated to glimpses of military garbed commandos taking out bad guys just like our Buffy. While admittedly weak, the Initiative storyline served as a stepping stone for, among other things, Buffy to get past Angel and Spike to become an integral member of the Scooby-gang. In that respect, the Initiative storyline served its purpose and, love him or hate him, gave us Riley.
With the departure of Oz, the reintroduction of Spike and Anya and the introduction of Tara and Riley, Buffy seemed to be reinventing itself. While most characters were greatly received (Anya, Spike and Tara), Riley has always been seen as a faulty character. Blame it on the writing, Marc Blucas or any other factor, the character was one-note and eventually wore thin. Personally, Riley never bothered me until season 5, so his presence throughout these 22 episodes doesn't really bother me all too much.
If for no other reason than that of a self-serving nature, the best episodes of the season are, in my opinion:
`The Harsh Light of Day': The return of Spike... and Anya... and Harmony!! Once again Jane Espenson proves she's Buffy's comic guru eliciting many a laugh from almost every character. The ending of this episode is also particularly affecting.
`Pangs': Aside from a clumsy Angel crossover, this episode provides many laughs. Not much plot development presiding in the episode, but, with the exception of season 3's `Amends' (which was decidedly weaker), it is the only non-Halloween holiday episode we've ever gotten.
`Something Blue': Who can't resist angsty inner-turmoil turned into irreverent hilarity? The whole Buffy-Spike thing is genius. Bewildered, helpless Giles is always good for a laugh too.
`Hush': Only a caustic Buffy fan attempting mockery would omit Hush as a tour de force episode of Buffy's entire run. The acting is top notch, the cinematography and score are also exceptional here. In hindsight, this really isn't much of a surprise: whenever an episode is penned by Whedon you can expect great things.
`The ""I"" in Team': Plenty of great Anya lines. Perfectly balances the plot development and hilarity. Witness the Willow-Anya-Xander poker game, Xander selling Boost bars and a certain static inducing protection spell.
`Who Are You': The second (and better) part of the season 4 Faith arc. The episode examines the Willow / Tara relationship, pre-empts the redemption of Faith and overall has fantastic performances from the whole cast in particular Sarah and Eliza.
`Restless': A precursor to Buffy's future (be back before dawn, etc.), `Restless' is, in my opinion, the best episode of the season and, aside from OMWF, the best episode of the series. Everything is perfect here: the music, the lighting, the sets, the art direction, the cinematography, the dialogue: leave it to Joss to perfectly capture the eerie nature of dreams that leave us both unsettled and somewhat abandoned. Probably the most artistic episode of the series, `Restless' is a flat out masterpiece and an essential part of the show's mythology.
Some other favorites include `Superstar,' `A New Man' and `The Yoko Factor.'
As immediate predecessor to the best season of Buffy and immediate successor to the most hyped season of Buffy, season 4 is often times over shadowed by the accomplishments of its bookends. This is a harsh injustice as the fourth season is a flat out masterpiece with practically nary a road bump; `Beer Bad', `The Initiative', `Doomed' and a few other episodes are the exceptions here (which is not to say they are without highlights).

With Buffy ending in a month, it seems wrong to calculate all the mishaps the show has taken over the years. It seems even more obscure that many fans attribute this season of Buffy with the ""worst season ever"" title. Some say Xander and Giles were underused, some say Adam is the worst big-bad ever, some say Riley was little more effective than a set prop. It matters not, because once you finish watching `Restless', you know you have just witnessed greatness.",1051315200,51,4721,4.991116751269035
1260318,5,B000035Z1M,"Okay, so I will admit that season 4 is not my favorite overall season episode wise, but character development wise it is definitely my favorite, especially the whole Willow storyline.  They have only been foreshadowing that she was gay since the first seaon (watch ""Prophecy Girl"" from season one where xander asks buffy to the dance) but more so in the 3rd season in dopplegangland.  season 4 also has some of my favorite episodes including hush, restless, and new moon rising.  Tara is so hot...

WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!
Here's my episode-by-episode guide to Season 4
#1 THE FRESHMAN - 4/5. A very good opener. Lots of comedic scenes and also shows the estrangement of your first few days of college nicely.
#2 LIVING CONDITIONS - 3.5/5. Funny funny episode! I wasn't really all that happy with how it turned out, but it keeps the laughs coming on in, and the editing techniques were great.
#3 THE HARSH LIGHT OF DAY - 4/5. This episode gets better with repeated viewings. Lots of good insights on relationships and such. Good music too, and seeing Spike in the sunlight was a treat.
#4 FEAR, ITSELF - 4/5. Genuinely creepy episode with great production design. Also some good foreshadowing for the rest of the show.
#5 BEER BAD - 2/5. Stupid, pointless episode. But I did kind of enjoy it's silly qualities. Quite funny in parts but overall - just lame and unneeded.
#6 WILD AT HEART - 4.5/5. The girl who plays Veruca was atrocious and brought this episode down from a 5. Everything else was excellent!
#7 THE INITIATIVE- 4/5. We finally learn about those damn commando guys! A good episode with many funny scenes that got the story-arc going.
#8 PANGS - 2.5/5. Gets worse everytime I watch it. The story isn't really needed to the arc of the season, and seems just pointless...
#9 SOMETHING BLUE - 4/5. Awesome comedic episode, with great performances by Sarah Michelle Gellar and James Marsters.
#10 HUSH - 5/5. Brilliant episode of BTVS - one of the best ever if you ask me! Joss did a brilliant directing and writing job. A unique, very frigtening, funny and just excellent and enjoyable hour of TV!
#11 DOOMED - 4/5. Keeps getting better with every viewing. Written by Marti Noxon, Jane Espenson and David Fury - this mixes all of their talents together - drama, comedy and action. Good episode, if not perfect.
#12 A NEW MAN - 4/5. Very almost a 4.5, maybe after more viewings. This episode was hilarious and finally Giles got his own little story arc. It didn't really move the story-arc along or anything, but fun all the same.
#13 THE I IN TEAM - 4/5. In which we are introduced to the big bad for season 4, and a questionable big bad he is...but the rest of this episode was 4.5 material!
#14 GOODBYE IOWA - 3.5/5. Didn't hold my interest as much as the previous episode, but this one definitely gets the big bad's story-arc on the road as we learn more about him. Marc Blucas' acting is also brilliant here.
#15 THIS YEAR'S GIRL - 4.5/5. Praise FAITH! She is just an amazing character and I can't explain how great it was to have her back. Everything about this episode was enjoyable - one of the best of the season!
#16 WHO ARE YOU - 5/5. Just when I thought it couldn't get better than This Year's Girl, they give us a true Jossian episode with Who Are You. It's a weird idea that could've gone awry, but instead it turns out to be a brilliant one that furthers our knowledge of the characteristics of both Faith and Buffy. Funny, dramatic - brilliant!
#17 SUPERSTAR - 4/5. Groovy little episode that gets better every time I watch it. Danny Strong did a great job and the alteration to the credits is just classic in the best sense of the word. Great job!
#18 WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE - 0.5/5. Even worse than Superstar. This episode gives a good reason for people to say why they don't like BTVS. This is probably the worst episode of the show ever.
#19 NEW MOON RISING - 4.5/5. Thank God for Oz! After those two HORRIBLE episodes beforehand, on comes Oz for his final episode of BTVS (I think, you never know with Joss). The acting here is great, and there is a lot of brilliantly written drama by Marti Noxon.
#20 THE YOKO FACTOR - 4.5/5. Good good good! A funny episode that prepares us for the showdown with Adam and the Initiative. Very well done and with great acting by Marc Blucas and David Boreanaz.
#21 PRIMEVAL - 4/5. Lots and lots of great action sequences here, and it was awesome to see the gang working as a team once more. The fight with Adam is just classic!
#22 RESTLESS - 5/5. One of the most amazing episodes of the show. Though it doesn't quite beat out Hush for best episode of the season. It is very close though. There is a lot of character development here, and the directing job is probably the best the show will ever have. A great way to finish S4!
--- DVD REVIEW ---
This DVD is great and gives you deeper insight into the ideas for the season. The writers and directors give you a lot of good insights into the episodes they wrote. I love this DVD package. You can buy it in NZ on Region 4 and it is excellent, so when it comes out in the USA, all you American BTVS fans better order a copy from Amazon!",1051056000,2,4930,4.3773173391494
1260322,5,B000035Z1M,"The Fourth Season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is definetly one of my favorite seasons, as it also is in the hearts of other Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans. This has a number of critically acclaimed episodes from ""Hush"" to ""Restless"" (""Hush"" was nominated for an emmy).
  Here's the Low Down on What Happened In Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 4:
  We see the return of everyone's favorite vampire Spike(sorry Angel), along with an old friend; a newly vampified Harmony. Buffy has a one night stand with Parker. She was looking for more than just one night but, he didn't want to hear it. Anya and Xander start dating, and so do Buffy and Riley. We find out that Giles can sing and that Riley is part of the secretive and shifty Initiative. We go deeper into the life of Willow's magic, and meet her new ""friend"" Tara. We also see the departure of Oz. In the end we once again see good triumph over evil when Buffy ultimately defeats Adam.
  The actors in Buffy the Vampire Slayer are amazing. You can tell they love what they do. I only have one problem with season 4. Miss Amber Benson (Tara) was not in the opening credits! My favorite charcter of all time, and my favorite actress, I think we should have seen a lot more of her name in the credits. (She was only in the credits once, in season 6, the episode where see died. I don't even want to get started with how much that upset me. We are after all hear to talk about season 4.)

That said reason for the 3 stars Fox Studios or Joss Whedon himself for whatever reason will not be releasing this in its original 16x9 format that it was filmed in (for region 1). I recomend buying this from Amazons sister sites http://www.amazon.co.uk or http://www.amazon.de to get the 16x9 version.",1050537600,11,445,4.792207792207792
1260324,5,B000035Z1M,"In Season Three of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" Joss Whedon and the show's writers proved that the series could survive Buffy killing Angel.  For Season Four the task was to prove that ""BtVS"" could survive losing Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley, who were spun off into their own film noir vampire detective series.  The surprising success of their effort is displayed in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Fourth Season,"" a season that is more impressive with each viewing.

When last we left our heroes most of them had just survived graduating from high school.  Now Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and Oz (Seth Green) are off to UC-Sunnydale while Xander (Nicholas Brendon) tries to survive in the real world and Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) twiddles his thumbs in his apartment.  Instead of the ""high school is hell"" idea, the underlying symbolism of the season is now the brave new world of college.  Buffy has moved out of the house to live in the college dorm (surprising), but with somebody other than Willow (more surprising), and is trying to move beyond Angel (sad, but not surprising).  After a dalliance with Parker Abrams (Adam Kaufman), the personification of that horrible ""transition"" person your friends always warned you about after your first big breakup, Buffy hooks up with clean-cut Iowa farm boy Riley Finn (Marc Blucas), charming psychology graduate assistant by day, Initiative super-soldier by night.

By now we are familiar with the double-story arc structure of a ""BtVS"" season.  For Season Four the first half story arc has to do with the mystery of the Initiative, while the second half is the confrontation with Adam.  More importantly, there are several monumental character changes inspired by the desire to keep a couple of actors and the decision of another cast member to leave.  Wanting to keep James Marsters around, the idea of putting that bloody chip in Spike's head, neutering the vampire when it comes to putting the bite on human beings, was a masterstroke (and, dare I say, surprising).  Suddenly, Spike is a de facto Scooby.  Meanwhile, with Emma Caulfield sticking around as Anya, she becomes the show's comic relief in place of her boyfriend Xander.  Then, when Seth Green left the show to concentrate on films, what we thought was an offhanded comment in ""Doppelgangland"" suddenly comes to fruition for Willow when she meets Wicca wannabee Tara (Amber Benson).  All of these changes end up having much more significant impacts on the show than the addition of Riley Finn as Buffy's new love interest.

Season Four begins with a lot of interpersonal issues, from trouble with dorm mates (""Living Conditions"") to getting dumped (""The Harsh Light of Day,"" ""Wild at Heart""), before getting caught up in the mystery of all those soldier types running around the campus in the dark (""The Initiative"").  Buffy and Riley finally discover the truth about each other in the landmark episode ""Hush,"" the only episode ever to earn Joss Whedon a well deserved Emmy nomination for Best Writing of a Drama (insert outrage over snubs of ""The Body"" and ""Once More With Feeling"" here, please).  The second half of the season finds Riley learning to work with Buffy (""Doomed"") and Buffy enjoying working with the Initiative (""A New Man"") before Professor Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse) tries to kill her (""The I in Team"") and her stitched together uber-demon Adam (George Hetzberg) breaks free and sets up the final confrontation (""Primeval"").

Ultimately, the strength of a season is judged by the episodes that are essentially off the main story arcs.  For Season Four this means a Halloween episode with one of the best punch lines ever (""Fear, Itself""), the great Buffy and Faith mind-switch (""This Year's Girl"" and ""Who Are You?""), the discovery that the coolest and most important in the world is Jonathan Levenson (""Superstar""), and the hilarious insanity of Willow's wish list (""Something Blue"").  Of course on that last episode once again the joke is on us as the alternative reality give us a preview of what is to come down the road.  One of the most unique aspects of this season was that the climatic battle with the year's big bad happens in the penultimate episode and the season finale, ""Restless,"" serves as an actual epilogue as Buffy and friends encounter the First Slayer (Sharon Ferguson), and sets the stage for significant develops to come.

The fact that Season Two ended with the greatest episode ever of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" in ""Becoming, Part II,"" when Buffy has to kill Angel to save the world, obscures the fact that on balance Season Three and Season Four were both stronger seasons overall.  The operatic finales might not reach the same heights, but the lows are higher and the on average score is higher.  The worst episode of Season Four is probably the season premier, ""The Freshman,"" which suffers because like all first episodes in a season of ""BtVS"" the goal is to have Buffy rededicate herself to being the Slayer so that new viewers can feel like they understand the gig.  If anything, Season Four reaffirms that the strength of this show is character development and not just vampire slaying.

Final Comment: It is nice to see that the extras for Season Four contain twice as many commentary tracks as we have been privy to for each of the previous three collections.  In a perfect world it would be great if all of the episodes had commentary, provided by shifting tag-team combinations of writers and actors, in the tradition of the very early episodes of ""Farscape"" on DVD, but I have long had the feeling that the cast of ""BtVS"" is rather intimidated by the encyclopedic knowledge of the show enjoyed by its fan base.",1050451200,174,5722,4.91995841995842
1260325,5,B000035Z1M,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer's 4th season was the first season when I actually said to myself, ""Joss Whedon is a genius..."" It's not that I didn't think he was a genius beforehand, but this was the season with the episodes that really pointed that out to me. The episodes of which I speak are ""Hush,"" Joss' creepy response to critics who thought that he'd [smell] without his snappy dialogue, ""Who Are You,"" where Faith inadvertently starts down her long road to redemption by literally walking in Buffy's shoes (my personal favorite episode), and ""Restless"", Joss' meandering walk through Buffy, Giles, Xander and Willow's dreams, to insightful and more frequently humorous effect. These three episodes stand to show what an amazing and imaginitive mind Joss Whedon has and why his writers consider him a ""benevolent dictator"" over them. And since this DVD comes with Joss' commentary on both ""Hush"" and ""Restless"", I must say it's the Buffy DVD set I've anticipated the most so far.
The rest of the season also has some gems. ""Fear, Itself"" is simply the best use of anti-climax that I have ever seen on TV or film. ""Beer Bad"" treats us to the more primitive side of Buffy. I'm particularly looking forward to ""Wild at Heart"", which will feature a special commentary track by Joss, Marti Noxon (writer/producer), and Seth Green.
There are a lot of changes in the cast in season 4.  Angel (David Boreanaz) and Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) have moved to LA (their further adventures are chronicled on Angel), and Oz (Seth Green), fearful of the wolf within, leaves to find himself. Their void is filled quite well by Spike (James Marsters), the former bad boy who unwillingly takes his first steps towards being a better man, Riley (Marc Blucas), Buffy's Army stud, Anya (Emma Caulfield), the ex-vengeance demon with a unique view of the world and incomprehensible obsession with Xander, and Tara (Amber Benson), a sweet Wicca with a little mystery.
The season is a little shaky as a whole. The whole Initiative and Adam story arc is kinda [weak], but those amazing episodes are so great that it's easy for me to take a ""forest for the trees"" approach to season 4. Still, check out the DVDs. Those three Joss episodes alone will be worth it (but I'm pretty sure you'll have a good time with the whole thing).",1050278400,53,2305,4.806045340050378

1260328,4,B000035Z1M,"Alright, I know that I have no reason to be reviewing something that hasn't come out yet, but hey, I can't help it.
Buffy season four has one of the best 'story arcs' in televison one man vs. the military working to it's advantage.  This season really was a re-write to all things Buffy, with the introduction of Riley, Buffy's only really normal boyfried.
With Riley comes an interesting situation, Buffy is still quite in love with Angel, and after an interesting Angel episode (where Angel becomes human) decides to finally try and move on.  She picks this uper military trained guy who works for an orginazation that tries to kill the main charas. in the show several times.
This season also marks Spike's return as a major chara. in the series.  He comes back and makes a complete fool of himself.  In proper Spike fashion, makin' fun of Angel and everything, which was just funny and all.
Probally the one thing that makes people either love or hate the season is the small little person that was introduced a Wicca group in 'Hush'.
Tara is the one reason that people tend to hate the season, in my mind, except maybe for Riley.  I really like to think that she was probally the best thing that had ever happened to Willow.  I mean really people, if you've watched Dopplegangland even once, you can see why Joss wrote the episode.  He was leading up the end of the Willow/Oz (Die Die) relationship.  It was full of foreshadowing to what was to come in Willow's rather twisted love life.  And hell, we all know Will's gay right?

1260330,5,B000035Z1M,"When a local TV station in my area first started airing the WB, the only show I wanted to check out was Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I had read good reviews of the show from places like Entertainment Weekly and Cinescape Magazine, and I was searching for something new to watch. I first started watching Buffy around the beginning of the third season, and as you have probably already guessed, it didn't take long for me to get hooked.

During the time the fourth season was airing, I had a routine. I specifically chose a schedule at work where I was off Tuesday through Thursday. I would finish my guitar lessons at the music store where I taught part-time about six thirty or so. Throw my Strat in the trunk, cruise through Tim Horton's for an Iced Cappuchino, and home at eight. Every Tuesday, like clockwork. After half a year of this, I realized something: I was addicted to Buffy in a way no television show had ever managed before.

The fourth season is widely regarded as the worst season of Buffy on the Internet. Because of this, I believe everybody is crazy.

Why? Why do I revere the fourth season above all others, when the majority of my fellow Buffyphiles see it as an embarrassment to be forgotten?

The answer, I think, lies in the very theme of the season - change. The loss of Angel and Cordelia, and later Oz, shook the show's formula to its roots, not to mention the shift from high school to college, from the library to Giles' place, from awkward Xander-piney Willow to blossoming funky-bohemian sexual awakening Willow. We were comfortable with the way things were! After two stellar seasons, Joss was changing everything! If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

But as I think back on it now, The Joss knew what he was doing. These actors were beginning to visibly age, and he knew he couldn't keep them in high school forever. A shake-up was just what the series needed to keep it fresh. And a shake-up we got.

First of all, every one of the Scoobies was removed from a comfortable existence and thrown into uncharted territory. Buffy without Angel. Xander out of adolescence and into early manhood. Willow - holy smokes, Willow! - first losing Oz, and then discovering something extraordinary about herself. And Giles, the fired Watcher and librarian who becomes Mr. Mid-Life Crisis Guy. All the Scoobies suddenly had to deal with transitions, never an easy time.

Next, the tone, the very feel of the show changed as well. Joss has said before the fourth season was the beginning of the show's ""Baroque"" era, and how right he is. Starting with ""Hush,"" the show's first true event, and continuing through altered reality episodes like ""Who Are You"" and ""Superstar,"" the show takes on an almost palpable air of foreboding and unreality, as the audience begins to notice hints that something is coming. (""You think you know...what you are...what's to come. You haven't even begun."") This tone, which lingered on through the first seven episodes of season five, may just be my single most enjoyable entertainment experience ever. I remember watching the last four episodes (""New Moon Rising,"" ""The Yoko Factor,"" ""Primeval,"" ""Restless"") over and over again, and I still do.

The key to enjoying the fourth season is understanding what it means: It's the turning point for the whole series.

The fourth season still has many of my favorite moments from the series:

Xander mangles Yoda's speech from The Phantom Menace.

Parker puts the moves on an apparently unsuspecting Willow, and gets a big surprise.

CaveBuffy responds to Parker's heartfelt apology.

""Actual Size.""

""The Big Bad is back, and this time..."" ZAP!

""Maybe you're trying too hard.""

Xander and Harmony, locked in mortal combat.

Giles uses transparencies.

Willow meets a fellow Wicca.

""Because it's wrong.""
""You can't just say Librum Incendere and..."" Fwoosh! Thunk!

Spike attempts to inspire Xander and Willow into mayhem.

Tara blows out a candle.

""You want some Fightin' Pants, Buff? I can get you some Fightin' Pants!""

The Battle of the Initiative, and the Charge of the Scoobies - my favorite Buffy action set piece.

Season 4 saw Joss' favorite running gag begin, and it goes like this: If you're a villain in Sunnydale, don't EVER make a Villain Speech.

And finally, last but not least, Xander's foreboding, sinister, sexy, terrifing dream, which still haunts me, and makes me think Xander might be in for a hard time of it before the series ends. (""You can't protect yourself from...some stuff."")

These are just a few, I know. But I just wanted to get the point across. Those of you who haven't seen it - buy it, watch it, remember it. There are events in the fourth season which are still resonating in the series to this day, and a close study of this season over time will only enrich your enjoyment of subsequent seasons.
Those of you who have seen season 4 and don't appreciate it for what it is, buy this set and give it another chance.

Buffy is set to end after episode 144, which makes the episodes from ""Hush"" through ""Restless"" the halfway point of the series. Once the final episode, ""Chosen,"" is finally aired, this story of Buffy, Xander and Willow transitioning from adolescence to adulthood will go down in TV history as one of the medium's most remarkable accomplishments - a show that frankly, honestly and always with hope examined what growing up really is; and it did it all with the conceit of a teen-age girl beating the snot out of vampires.

And the fourth season, especially ""Restless,"" is the turning point where the Scoobies begin to realize their journey is just beginning. Don't miss it.

""Hush"" her intro, ""New Moon Rising"" (i love this episode, dispite how much i loved Seth Green on the show, because while all Wiccans aren't lesbians, i felt it added realism for Willow to discover that new side to herself.)Her appearence in ""Restless"" was excellent also.

1260332,5,B000035Z1M,"First of all I happen to think that ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"" is the best show in the history of television.  With that being said the 4th Season isn't the best of the series but it is far from the worse.  Its a transition year from high school to college, plus the deletion of Angel and Cordelia from the cast, which I think was a good thing.  Spike is a much more interesting character than Angel could ever be and Anya well is Anya.  The only disappointing loss is Oz, I still miss him on the show, but with his departure we get to see Willow go in a new direction and even though it was tough at first, it was done gradually so we got to like and get to know Tara just like the rest of the scoobies.
Season Four is also a year of great individual episodes; Something Blue, Hush, This Year's Girl, Who Are You, Restless, etc.  There is no all time great Big Bad in year four and there is of course the bland Riley, but season four is a must for any Buffy fan or a curious fan.

1260334,5,B000035Z1M,"It is a testament to how solid Buffy is that it survived the unsurvivable - the transition from a high school show to a college show.  90210 could not do it, neither could Saved By the Bell...they relied too much on the ""high school"" aspect of the show.  But I digress.  Yes, this season has some changes, and yes, some people will not like them.  However, I believe one of the central themes OF this series is the constant changes and challenges the characters have to face, and how they prevail.  If you look, you can find all the charm from the previous seasons in the episodes of season 4.  Try and look past the ""no more high school"" part and see what you think.
Ok, some episodes are kinda beat.  I hate the roommate one, just because the roommate is so narsty.  I have never really been a fan of the season finale, either.  But what about other stuff about which people seem to complain?  ok #1 is Riley.  Yes, He's NOT a vampire.  But big deal, he's an apple-pie Iowa boy with a double life.  In any other series he would look like a total bada$$ but next to Buffy he seems normal.  #2 is Tara.  She is NOT like the other characters, but breaks out of her shell slowly.  Plus, lots of people will never forgive her for simply not being OZ.  However, the way that she and Willow find a common bond (illustrated powerfully in ""Hush"") is wonderful; these are not two women who fall in love, they are two WITCHES who fall in love.  Funny, isn't it.  Xander loves a demon, Willow loves a witch, and Buffy loves a normal guy.  #3 is Adam.  I guess people think he was introduced too late, or is not ""larger than life"" enough.  I LIKE the way they set this guy up (""my purpose is to extinguish life wherever I find it."") and if you think that his finale is kinda silly, think about the logic in the mayor's final episode from season 3 (don't get me wrong, I love season 3).  Adam's realization that he is not invincible, just before Buffy kills him, is wonderful.  His re-creation of Forrest and his insistent bonding with Riley is kinda cool.  This season was a necessary transition between 1,2,3 and 5+.  (As a result of this ""transition"" season, Season 5 was phenomenal, bright and exciting.)

Not only had my prayers for a weekly series been answered, but the writing was consistently top notch.
And then, this season hit...Since Joss Whedon was now recognized as a hot creative force, he was in high demand, and consequently entrusted the BTVS world to people who apparently had lower standards.
On top of that, several key cast members from earlier seasons were written off. David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter's spin off into LA-based ""Angel"" meant the scooby gang was short two central characters, although it can be argued Carpenter had less of a critical role. Instead, we received numerous fly by night male partners as if the new writing team themselves was reluctantly having to admit they did not know what they were doing in the plot department. Pinning over Oz's departure, I do admittedly like Tara, but again feel newly hired staff incompetence is to blame for character development flaws.
Once an evil vampire, Spike was convieniently given a chip so he could attempt to approximate the 'good vampire role'. Novel the first time around, it could have worked on this attempt if the production team had stayed away from plot lengths which made scooby doo look like masterpiece theater. If the writers and production team were really that lost and bored, why even attempt to continue the show in the first place? At times it seemed as if they had not watched earlier seasons of the show and were simply filling the airwaves for activity's sake.

  The fourth season was about change, and change it did have.  It followed the core characters: Buffy Anne Summers(Sarah Michelle Gellar), Willow Rosenberg (Allyson Hannigan), Daniel ""Oz"" Ozborne (Seth Green), and Alexander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) out of high school and into the real world.  For Buffy, Willow, and Oz the real world consisted of College and independence; and for Xander the real world turned out being many side-jobs that end up leading to his eventually life path.
  The deduction of Angel (David Boreanaz) and Cordelia (Charisma Charpenter), from the show made it suffer a little, but there leaving was not in vain.  The show gained the much fan loved Spike (James Marsters).  Tara McCaly (Amber Benson) who would end up playing a much more important role than she should have.  Anya (Emma Caulfield) the comic releaf ex-demon, who decides that she loves Xander.  And finally Riley Finn (Marc Blucas) who was Buffy first and only ""Human"" Boyfriend.
  The main point of this season was about how the transistion from High School to the ""Real World"" is hard, but it is obtainable.  The plot consisted Buffy finding a new boyfriend who ends up being part of a government opperation that expirements on Demons, Oz's departure and the Willow dabbling in Magic and her sexulaity, and the introduction of Anya who in time would become on of the key players in the Buffyverse.
  Season four has many stand out episodes: Hush (the only time Buffy has been nominated for an Emmy), Something Blue, Fear Itself (Who can't love the last 5 minutes?), Superstar, and Restless (Which still three years later, plays a very important part in its foreshadowing).

Although this is the worst (or shall we say least good?) season of Buffy (tied with season 6) it is still very good. There are some classic episodes contained in this DVD set-Hush of course, Fear Itself, Pangs, Something Blue, Doomed with some unforgettable quotes from Spike, and Where The Wild Things Are. And yet still there are some episodes that fall completely short of Buffy fans expectations-The Freshman arguably the worst season premier of all 7 seasons, Beer Bad-I think it's the frat guys (this episode is saved only by Xander and his usual hilarious antics), The I In Team and Goodbye Iowa which was sort of a 2 part episode that I found very boring despite the introduction of Adam. As I said before-this is the least good of Buffy's seasons and yet still great. I'm very excited about this set coming out (I'm counting the days!) but what I'm looking forward to even more is the Season 5 set (gonna have to wait till next winter for that one, curses!). So on June 10th I hope all you Buffy fans out here will pick up your very own copy of Season 4 Buffy The Vampire Slayer.",1047600000,,1169,4.4672897196261685
1260340,5,B000035Z1M,"OK, here is the deal. Every episode in this season is awesome.
I guess that's because i am an extremely big buffy fan.
Here are the 5 best episodes from S4 (In Order).

  1. Restless(one of the best episodes ever)
  2. Primeval(action packed with action)
  3. The Yoko Factor(Very Dark in my perspective)
  4. The Harsh Light of Day(Very Funny and a hint of evil)
  5. The Freshman(A Very well waited season premiere.
Hush is very good too but not in MY top 5.
This season basically is about Buffy dealing with the loss of angel and fearing the horrors of college (thanks to Sunnydale High).  We find out Willow is gay and Buffy finds a new man in her life..., Riley. Later in the season they both find out their true identities in ""Doomed"". Riley an intiative, and buffy the slayer have to deal with eachother being powerful but buffy overall. Maggie Walsh, the leader of the initiative, lets buffy into their conspiracy but later tries to kill her in an episode called ""The I in Team.""  This reason is that buffy was discovering too much and almost found out about 314. Maggie Walsh is killed by Adam(known as 314) who escapes. Adam gets Spike to split the gang up so he can take on her by himself but they all come together in ""primeval"" and take on Adam. The explosive pre-season finale ends with a touch of an extra(not done in any other season)episode to fill in the 22nd spot.  ""Restless"", an episode where Buffy,Willow,Xander and Giles dream very weird and extroirdinary(might be spelled wrong) things. While this happens everyone is being hunted by the first slayer who was awoken in ""Primeval"", while being visited by the cheese man. So that wraps it up basically and that comment on Season 7, your wrong.  Season 7 is a very good season and it will end with a tremendous series finale(all in my opinion).",1047168000,,1815,4.558641975308642
1260341,4,B000035Z1M,"This season is quite excellent--and vastly underrated. Though not my favorite (it probably is my 4th favorite, behind seasons 5, 3, and 7), but it still contains some knockout moments, and huge contributions to the slayer mythos.
Let me also begin by saying that the character of Riley is also very underrated and misunderstood. He was Buffy's first attempt at a ""normal"" boyfriend after Angel -- and like many of the things she attempts to do to make her life ""ordinary,"" it backfires. Also, Riley/Marc Blucas is quite the stud (I think he's sexier than Angel), and he introduces the entire Initative arc of the storyline, which I think is quite inspired and exciting. If anything, the introduction of the government & military into the story showed that, aside from the Scoobies and the Council, there are more groups out there battling the forces of darkness (though the Initative's end goal was clearly misguided).
Season four also introduces Tara, and the First Slayer--both important characters to the future of the series. It is in this season that we begin to explore the roots and the origin of the slayer power: an exploration that continues throughout the seasons, and appears to be climaxing in this current one (season 7).
Favorite eps: Hush (of course), Faith 2-parter This Year's Girl and Who are You?, 2-parter Yoko Factor and Primeval, Restless (which introduces the First Slayer and foreshadows things yet to come on future seasons), and Where the Wild Things Are (an otherwise lame episode, except for the fact that Marc Blucus spends nearly the entire episode without any clothes on--gotta love that!)",1047081600,,1621,5.007407407407407
1260342,3,B000035Z1M,"I never watched Buffy until on a whim, I picked up the first season on DVD.  I was hooked.  I watched the entire set in one day and ran out and bought season 2.  I had to wait for season three to be released and in the meantime I started watching reruns on the FX channel.
Season 4 is incredibly weak compared to the rest.  Why?
1. Willow being gay?  huh?  This plot twist really helps out none.  She was a perfect character when she was torn between Xander and Oz and was starting to come into herself as a woman.  I'm not against gay characters at all, but Tara is not very interesting and it seemed that the entire character of Willow was changed by this mistake.
2. Departure of Oz, Cordelia and Angel.  It was like losing three of my frineds.  Just when Cordelia's character was starting to show some depth.  Angel and Oz were always great characters.
2.5. The loss of Faith.  Man I was rooting for her to be redeemed, but her appearances don't do it.  I know they had to get rid of her because she kept blowing everyone off the screen that she did a scene with, but I really missed her this season.
3. The Initiative was just far too boring (it felt like old six million dollar man episodes with them).
4. Buffy's new love interest, Riley, was too boring.
5. We've lost the high school thing that was so fun.
6. They needed to start letting the other characters respect Xander for his character and loyalty, despite being the only one with no super powers.  They started playing him for too much comic relief.
7.  I never have like the Xander/Onya romance. Though, I like each individual character well enough.
Nevertheless, a weak season of Buffy is probably better than a strong season of 99% of the series that are out there and the show did hold my attention, and most of the individual epidsodes work, the characters just didn't seem like my buddies anymore.
Season 5 is a good rebound in my opinion (Michele Trachtenberg lights up the screen everytime she is on it, even if they make her character too whiny).
Season 6 & 7 also seem to get even more back in form.",1046908800,15,2075,4.353246753246753
1260343,5,B000035Z1M,"I've been watching Buffy since the beginning and think it has been the most consistently amazing show TV has ever produced. I can't say that season four is the best, but I couldn't say that about any of the seasons. There are certain things that I like and dislike about each season and could never discern which is the best and worst. Instead, I'll just give you my top 10 list of favorite episodes:
10. Lie To Me (season 2)
9. Conversations With Dead People (season 7)
8. Wrecked (season 6)
7. Normal Again (season 6)

2. Graduation Day 1 & 2 (season 3)
1. Doppelgangland (seasone 3)

1260344,5,B000035Z1M,"Ok, based on that first comment my 5 stars seems out of sorts. But fear not, it will all make sense in a minute.
I have to say that Season 4 was one of my least favorite due to Riley, otherwise known by his not-so-loving-fans, and as dubbed by Spike, ""Captain Cardboard"", one of the most contrived characters on the show EVER. I sincerely feel sorry for Marc Blucas, who portrays him, for having one of his first major roles be that of: a)Angel's first real replacement, which drew intense hatred from die hard Buffy/Angel shippers; and b)this squeaky clean, I'm-destined-to-be-Buffy's-new-perfect-boyfriend AND Captain America character.
Anyway, my point -and I do have one rest assured- is that despite this nerve-grating character, the season has some real gems. My personal favorite is ""Something Blue"", which fully displayed the amazing chemistry between Buffy and the ever adorable, sexy and hilarious Spike for the first time.  Other greats include ""Hush"", one of the creepiest episodes ever, as well as ""Harsh Light of Day"", ""The Yoko Factor"" -what can I say, James Marsters is an incredible actor!-, and the 2 part Faith stint.
All in all, this season, like all the others in my opinion, is well worth your time -and if you're anything like me the FF button on your DVD will be very useful in cutting through all those Riley scenes to get to Spike ^_^",1046736000,4,1360,4.811965811965812
1260345,4,B000035Z1M,"Season Four was where Buffy began its slow decline, starting to sow story and character contradictions that would later come back and bite it. Story quality became spottier, though it remained consistently pretty high. The departure of Angel (David Boreanaz) and Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) from the regular cast, and the placement of the other principals in college, put a dent in the show's formula - but the show was still strong overall, and well worth watching.
Facing the greater perils of burgeoning adulthood, Buffy and Willow (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alyson Hannigan) take to college at Sunnydale U. Slacker Xander (Nicholas Brendon) pinwheels his way through life at small-change jobs, with new girlfriend Anya Emerson (Emma Caulfield), the brutally tactless (though endearingly comical) former vengeance demon. Buffy's ex-Watcher, Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), adjusts with some difficulty to middle-aged ""empty nest syndrome,"" no longer having a clear-cut role in the Scooby Gang's lives. Buffy acquires a new love - and probably her first healthy one - in clean-cut athlete and paramilitary trooper Riley Finn (Marc Blucas).
But Sunnydale is still Sunnydale, with more belowground evils erupting to the surface than ever were buried by a spade. In addition to the usual vampires and otherworldly nasties associated with the Hellmouth, a shadowy quasi-governmental military outfit exists beneath the college campus - ""the Initiative"" - which studies, and attempts to control, supernatural monsters in terrestrial man's world. Buffy's old adversary, Spike (James Marsters), is one of their prisoners and experimental subjects, turned into a Clockwork Orange freak by their zealous machinations - in time, to become an unlikely escapee informer for Buffy and the Scooby Gang, when the Initiative turns out to be perhaps more deadly than the monsters it is theoretically fighting.
It seems the idealistically insane head of the Initiative, Buffy's psychology professor, Dr. Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse), does more than merely fight monsters in her spare time - she also tinkers them together. Her pet project, ""Adam"" (George Hertzberg), a super-intelligent and oddly charismatic Frankensteinian quasi-human/demon patchwork-quilt of parts, has ambitions of his own that go far beyond the wildest imaginings of his ersatz mother, Dr. Walsh - and threaten far more than Sunnydale, and its immediate environs.
Some of the series' weakest episodes are in this season, but also a high number of its strongest. ""Hush,"" a mini-classic (and something of a television event) in which UFO Gray-ish demon nightstalkers steal the voices of all Sunnydale and go on a carving spree, is great entertainment, no matter how you choose to look at it. Buffy's arch-nemesis - the fallen Slayer, Faith (Eliza Dushku) - returns from the coma into which Buffy placed her at the end of the previous season and wreaks havoc on Buffy's life by trying to steal it for herself, in the episodes ""Who Are You"" and ""This Year's Girl."" Oz (Seth Green) and Willow have a surprise, near-tragic parting, as the result of a lycanthropically challenged romantic rival for Willow's affections named Veruca (Paige Moss), in ""Wild at Heart."" Some nice comic touches are added to the season in ""A New Man,"" with Giles finding himself transformed into a Fyarl demon by his old nemesis Ethan Rayne (Robin Sachs) and requiring rescue from his condition by (of all people) Spike; school loser Jonathan (Danny Strong) becomes a temporary god of all that is cool, in ""Superstar""; the Scooby Gang confronts its own worst fears in ultimately humorous fashion in ""Fear, Itself,"" and more dramatically in the season finale, ""Restless""; and former Cordette at Sunnydale High, Harmony Kendall (Mercedes McNab), becomes first a comical Spike sidekick and later an even more humorous attempted arch-nemesis of Buffy throughout the season.
You could do better than this season of Buffy - but not by much, and only with the second or third seasons of Buffy.",1046736000,22,4019,5.300940438871473
1260346,3,B000035Z1M,"Maggie Walsch, Adam and the Initiative aren't satisfying villains. Riley is a tedious character and I personally feel that this is the season where things start to fall apart. Tara, though I didn't like the idea at the beginning, is a lovely addition to the cast, while I didn't find Oz's exit particularly believable. Spike, Anya and Xander are good comic relief as well as being wonderfully drawn out characters like usual. While individually many of the episodes of Season 4 are good, as a whole it's lacking. It just can't work without an interesting big-bad. The other major problem is Marc Blucas's lack of talent, but to his credit, Riley's not much of a role.
A great deal of the season is quite enjoyable, don't get me wrong. I just wouldn't reccomend this to the idealist Buffy fan.",1046736000,3,792,4.705035971223022
1260347,4,B000035Z1M,"While season four was probably my least favorite season overall, it had some of my favorite Buffy episodes ever. ""Restless"" was a very funny and very complex episode. A viewer can learn more about the series each time they watch this episode, and Joss's commentary should provide a lot of insight. ""Hush"" was a wonderful, groundbreaking episode that got deserved recognition from the Emmys.
The overall arc was not as strong as in previous seasons. Riley was a one-dimensional, boring character, and the Initiative was just not interesting. Adam had superhuman strength, but he was just boring. Oz's leaving was heartbreaking, and my opinion is that Willow was thrown into a relationship with another girl. However, I think that Tara proved to be a great addition to the show, and their relationship developed into something really special. Angel and Cordelia leaving hurt the show, because they were two very different characters that brought a different dynamic, and the chemistry between Buffy and Angel was unmatched.
All in all, Buffy had to go through a lot of changes in the fourth season, and I think it handled them pretty well.",1046563200,,1137,5.021164021164021
1260348,4,B000035Z1M,"Season 4 is not the best season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" ever made, or even the second best.  It is, however, a strong year worthy of at least a few repeat viewings, and the longer-than-usual list of bonus features on the forthcoming DVD set should make for an exciting week once your box set is unwrapped.
Up through the end of Year 3, ""Buffy"" was synonymous with funny, engaging villains.  Season 4 doesn't really deliver on that count.  The year opens promisingly with Lindsey Crouse as the potentially evil professor Maggie Walsh, Buffy's psychology overseer at the amusingly fictitious UC-Sunnydale.  By the end of the year, however, the villain is a chatty cyborg named Adam who gets dispatched before the final episode.  The last two discs in the box set will be full of a lot of Adam-chasing, but no real payoff a la ""Graduation Day"" or ""Becoming"", no real thrill akin to Buffy's climactic rooftop battle with Faith, or her alliance with Spike against Angel.
What Season 4 is so memorable for is two things: a group of very funny standalone episodes, and Willow.  This is the year Willow blossomed and became arguably the show's breakout star -- she's pictured on the DVD cover, and beginning with Episode 10, ""Hush"", her much-ballyhooed relationship with Tara emerges even better than you remembered it.
The first episodes of Season 4 are a lot like high-school era ""Buffy"".  ""The Freshman"" and ""Graduation Day"" both feature thematic villains tied to Buffy's fear of college (i.e., the roommate from hell turns out to be, indeed, a roommate from Hell).  ""The Harsh Light of Day"" introduces Season 4 in earnest -- Cordelia and Angel have moved to the spinoff series which concludes this episode, but they're replaced, starting here, by Anya, Xander's demon girlfriend, and the return of Spike.
""Fear Itself"" and ""Beer Bad"" are both comedies, the first another successful Halloween episode (""Is it bad to taunt the fear demon?"" ""No, but it is tacky""), and the second a less well-received story about demonic... beer.  Meanwhile, Buffy's had an ill-fated one-night stand with a college lothario, and Oz is about to uncover his true calling in the heartbreaking ""Wild at Heart"".
Oz's departure is followed by ""The Initiative"", which reveals Professor Walsh and studly assistant Riley Finn to be secret government agents hot on the trail of Sunnydale's demon army.  ""Pangs"" detours into a weak Thanksgiving adventure, while ""Something Blue"" opens the book on Dark Willow (and features some hilarious Buffy-Spike love scenes).
""Hush"" is probably the best episode of ""Buffy"", ever.  Absolutely not to be missed.  The plot dips a little over the next several episodes, as Buffy joins the Initiative and is quickly betrayed by Professor Walsh, who is in turn deposed by Adam, her demon/cyborg creation.  Things return to high form when Faith returns for an eventful two-parter in which she switches bodies with Buffy.  A funny return by Harry ""The Mayor"" Groening, as well (watch out for the tiny worm).
""Superstar"" is another can't-miss, unrelated (mostly) to the ongoing Initiative plot.  It's the grand return of Jonathan, the designated vampire-bait from the high school years who's suddenly become Sunnydale's most coveted citizen (check out the altered opening titles, and the poster in Riley's room).  That's followed by ""New Moon Rising"", the heartbreaking conclusion to the relationship between Willow and Oz... and the enthusiastic beginning of Willow and Tara's.
Unusually, the season's arc concludes with a two-parter prior to the final episode.  ""The Yoko Factor"" and ""Primeval"" dip a little more deeply into Slayer mythology as Adam is dispatched.  This clears the deck for ""Restless"", a dream-episodes, the ramifications of which are still unfolding even as ""Buffy"" is now deep into Season 7.  Again, an episode to be watched several times.",1046563200,7,3860,5.088748019017433

And if your the kind of person that just wants to watch an episode once in a while without sitting down for the full 1000 minutes and get into the entire storyline this is the ultimate season.
Not that the storyline isn't good I thought it was actually good just not really given the treatment it should have gotten.
Yes there are better seasons but face it the best seasons have huge storylines following through them which who should really watch from the beginning.
This is a season of change and for a show which was pretty much based on: HIGH-SCHOOL kids fight demons once in a while.
So the fact that they actually had to change the statement of the show and handle it smoothly was a little too much to ask.
It has the ups and downs of this show and a must-have for any lover of good tv.
Even though I am a little mad that this version has an extra commentary which the  collector's edition (considerably more expensive) did not have and then to top it off a Joss Whedon AND Seth Green commentary!

As far as I'm concerned, Buffy was consistently great from Season 1, Episode 1 clear through ""Tabula Rasa"" in Season 6, when the show suddenly, inexplicably took a dive from which it has never quite recovered.
So Riley was a little dull and Adam wasn't the best Big Bad.  So they might have done a little more exploring of college life.  When you have episodes like ""New Moon Rising,"" ""Something Blue,"" ""Hush,"" ""A New Man,"" ""Restless"" and the Buffy/Faith two-parter, who cares?  Willow's hilarious dorm-room encounter with a de-fanged Spike is practically reason enough all by itself to buy this set.",1046304000,,692,4.781512605042017
1260351,5,B000035Z1M,"I have the PAL version of this set. It's in 16x9 widescreen and, apart from a slightly ""soft"" transfer, the wider video field really adds to the scope of the show. I'm disappointed that the region 1 set will be cropped to fullscreen. No matter what the studio is saying to worm out of this, this show (starting with season four) was shot in widescreen and we should be getting the DVDs that way.
As to the show itself, Buffy is one of my very favorite series and I've enjoyed every season. Although the ""big bad evil"" of season four was not as compelling to me as some of the others, the set includes some of the show's most memorable episodes. In other words, I thought season four was excellent more on the strength of it's parts than the whole.
If you're a Buffy fan, you probably already have the release date marked on your calendar. If you're new to the show, start with the ealier season sets and see what you've been missing. It's a show that delivers a clever mix of drama, comedy, romance, horror, and teen angst, in a brew that has captured both mass and cult audiences in it's spell.",1046304000,,1095,4.372549019607843
1260352,4,B000035Z1M,"I agree with the consensus that the 4th season is the weakest seaason of BTVS. Having said that, however, I also think that it's still far superior to most of the garbage on TV.
There was a lot of change in Season 4. Three characters (Angel, Cordelia, and Oz later on) left. Two new characters (Riley and Tara) were introduced. Two other characters (Spike and Anya) become much more prominent.
Also, they weren't in high school anymore. There was no longer one central place that bonded them together. Willow and Buffy attended school together, but Giles and Xander struggled to find new direction, and poor Spike had to contend with the chip.
I think that the build up and resolution of the big bad was not the best in this season. Adam/The Initiative were just never that effective as villians. They were too cold and detached and didn't really evoke much of a response. In contrast, the Master was a ""like to hate him,"" Angelus was an evil bastard who I wanted to see die, and the Mayor was hysterically neurotic and chillingly evil.
Still, as with other seasons of Buffy, the writing is overall fantastic, and this season contains two of my favorite episodes of all time: ""Hush"" and ""Fear, Itself"" (Giles: ""I should have translated the Gaelic inscription under the illustration of Gachnar."" Buffy: ""What's it say?"" Giles: ""'Actual size.'"") :-)",1046217600,5,1347,4.785407725321888

Episode 66: Hush
A group of murderous creatures straight out of a fairy tale steal away the townspeople's voices
one of the best thing i ever saw on TV.
i just hope like the european version of season 4 one of the special features is the making of the HUSH episode. Worth the money alone for this episode",1046131200,,330,4.253968253968254
1260354,4,B000035Z1M,"Only six is below four in quality, but unlike season six, this season still had a lot of what makes Buffy great and better than most TV.
Buffy had its beginnings as an extended metaphor for High School and the first half of season four made it seem like the show could not survive the transition to college. Episode One (The Freshman) was a weak opener (and suffered from the strong premier of Angel immediately after). It did not help that the early good episodes (Fear, Itself for example) relied heavily on humor. It wasn't until episode six (Wild at Heart) which began Willow's path to Tara that the season began to move. A twenty-two episode season is hurt by treading water until episode six.
However, after that we did have some classics, including the Buffy episode that most deserved an Emmy, Hush. When an evil spell renders Sunnydale silent our heroes don't find a cheap out, but have to fight the bad without speaking. The quiet of Hush is amazing.
Beyond Hush, Something Blue (a premonition of Willow's wrath), This Year's Girl/Who Are You (the return of Faith two parter), and New Moon Rising (the single best ""I'm gay"" episode TV has done) shine.
The thing that really weighs down season four is the season's big bad: Adam and the Initative. They seem more like X-Files rejects than Slayer enemies. Add in their ties to Buffy's new love Riley (a very weak post-Angel romance) and the season plot of Buffy, so important in carrying seasons two and three to strong endings, winds up less compelling than the individual episodes of the season.  As a result the ""plot arc"" episodes are weaker than non-arc ones. The finest example may be the last episode. Unlike seasons 1-3 and 5, season 6 doesn't deal with the big Bad in the last episode, but the next to the last. In fact it ends with a quiet episode concerning nightmares left from the methods used to kill off the Big Bad and is more interesting and moving than the defeating of the Big Bad himself (compared to our bawling our eyes out at the same point in 2 and 5 or the cheering at the end of 3). Too much of it was just TV.
But that last line describes why it gets a four. At it's worse, BtVS Season 4 was just TV. At its best it was still Buffy. Several very good episodes live up to the standard set in the second and third season. It also sets up many important plot lines and background for Season Five, most obviously with Willow's growth as a witch and her relationship with Tara. Not just for completests, but for anyone interested in above average TV, but only after you've seen the second and third (you need four to understand a lot of five though).",1046044800,,2630,4.479166666666667
1260355,5,B000035Z1M,"After Angel's departure in season three's finale, and the change of environment from highschool to college, we find a vampire slayer who is falling down. This fourth season really proved that the series could move on from its main concepts, without betraying its general idea. The first three seasons the series was all about the Buffy and Angel relationship and the highschool/hellmouth analogy... Amazingly enough, the series kept being wonderfull after leaving these two concepts behind. This was really proved in the early episodes of the season. Is this change healthy or adecuate? Buffy herself seems to be asking this question when she struggles to find her place in campus.
In ""Living Conditions"" Buffy finds out that even Willow fits better than she in campus. She has a hard time fighting a vampire with an attitud, but, then again, an even greater misfit, Xander, gives her the strength to overcome her doubts about the future and the new live that is unfolding before her. This great episode has one of those moments when you say AUCH: that beautifull, meaningfull umbrella she got in the Prom Dance gets destroyed under the vampire's feet. This is the season in which Joss Whedon decided to hint us all of the story lines from the get go. In this first episode Oz feels something strange as he crosses a girl (Veruca), and we get to see a little bit of those iniciative guys, as well as Riley makes his first appearance.
The second episode, ""The Freshman"", shows Buffy dealing with the fact that she will have to share her space with another student... a Cher-do you believe in love-fanatic-student, that is. Everything about her is annoying and Buffy starts wishing she were a vampire or a demon. Of course, in the end, Buffy finds a way to adjust... with Willow, of course.
""The harsh light of the day"" is one of best episodes of the season... well, it is Spike's return, so how could it be otherwise? There is a ring that would allow vampires to come out to the sun, and Spike finds it... meanwhile Buffy finds out that a horny college boy can be more harmfull that Angel losing his soul. so, when Spike faces Buffy, he finds her depressed. Oh! And we get to see Harmony again... when I saw the episode the first time, i went: how cool is that?
The following episodes develop Buffy's attempts to recover from her deception, Riley discovering his feelings towards Buffy, Xander getting close to Anya and Willow getting deeper into her relationship with Oz.
Finally it's time for the iniciative to appear. In the episode properly named ""The Iniciative"", Riley's character is explored and we get to see his work in the iniciative as well as his teacher and boss, Maggie Walsh. Also, Spike, who has been captured by the iniciative, escapes and finds out that they have done something to him and he is now unable to bite people for food.
After a not so good appearence of Angel in a thanksgiving episode (""Pangs""), comes probably the best episode of the season. It is the Emmy nominated ""Hush"", where a group of fairy-tale-like gentlemen come to Sunnydale to collect hearts after stealing the voices of everyone in town. There is hardly any dialogue in the episode. In the end of the episode, Buffy and Riley discover each other's secret.
A few episodes later, the Iniciative and Maggie Walsh begin to be a problem, as a secret project starts raising questions. Questions Buffy is willing to ask in ""Then I in team"". Maggie tries to kill Buffy, and Riley begins to doubt his boss, as well as Buffy, after he sees Spike in a scooby reunion. In ""Goodbye Iowa"" the big bad appears finally: Adam, a creature one third machine, one third human and one third monster... how baroque is that?
A hiatus from this storyline is the two parter: ""This year's girl"" and ""Who are you"", in which Faith comes to from her coma and seeks revenge agains Buffy and her friends. She takes Buffy's body in the end of the first and in the second one she begins to realize the positive side of her power, while Buffy has to escape from the guys sent by the council to seize her (or to seize Faith). Of course, in the end, things get back to normal, but not before Riley and the Buffy-embodied Faith do the wild thing.
The end of the season finds the gang being separated by a plot of Spike's, who is serving Adam's purposes. Fortunately they solve their problems and decide to break in the Iniciative to try and destroy Adam through a spell that will conjure the first slayer. Hell breaks free in the iniciative as Adam faces Buffy. The gang finally succeed. But in ""Restless"", the season finale, the consequences of the spell they used come to hunt them: the first slayer comes to kill them trough their dreams.
But this story line is not the best of this season... There is also the Willow's plot: Oz leaves and she finds new love in Tara, but as Oz returns in ""New moon rising"" he discovers that his werewolfness can be brought by Willow. And Anya and Xander begin a strong relationship.
Here is my top 10:
10. New moon rising.
9. The Freshman.
8. Living Conditions.
7. A new man (Buffy is turned into a demon by his old friend Ethan Rayne).
6. Primeval (Buffy's final confrontation with Adam)
5. Restless (I know I'm probably one in a million who has this episode as one of his favorites, but i just loved the surreal, hipnotic aproach they gave to this season finale).
4. Superstar (Jonathan as a hero and a role modell to the vampire slayer? Something is wrong, and very funny... watch for those opening credits).
3. The Harsh Light of the day
2. Something Blue (Willow tries to recover from Oz's departure through a spell that makes her able to force her will in reality. And her twisted will includes Giles getting blind, Xander becoming a demon-magnet and Buffy falling in love with Spike... just hilarious).
1. Hush.",1046044800,,5812,4.621856866537717
1260356,5,B000035Z1M,"Though you may not consider this the strongest season of BtVS, do you really want it to rank lower than many other mediocre series (with less discerning fans) by giving it a 4-out-of-5?  I've noticed some of the later seasons of the inferior ""X-Files"" ranking 4 1/2 stars on this site.  You may acknowledge that the rating is ""relative to BtVS standards"" in your review, but your comments will disappear in days, and the casual observer only notes the overall average, and they'll probably assume it's relative to TELEVISION standards.  Consider that when you rate it.  Thanks for your time.",1045958400,,591,4.88
1260367,4,B000035Z1M,"Season Four of Buffy sees the titular character, along with her friends, moving into college.  As Buffy seasons go, I certainly prefer the previous ones.
Season Four deals with much more adult themes than one, two or three; after all, our lead characters are now adults themselves.  This means that we're seeing a lot more sexuality, and more 'mature' feeling relationships.  Personally, I don't find that this change is necessarily good.  I miss the innocence of the Scoobies' high school years - the Willow (Alyson Hannigan) has a crush on Xander (Nicholas Brendon), Xander has a crush on Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), and Buffy has a crush on Angel (David Boreanz) things that went on during seasons one and two.
Season four is also a season of change, and a season of departures.  The series does suffer from the loss of Angel, glad as I am to see that the talented David Boreanz snagged his own spin-off show.  Some of the best story arcs from seasons one, two and three revolved around Angel, and Buffy loses a lot of its emotional intensity with his departure.  Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) is also inexplicably gone, having gone to Los Angeles (where she would meet Angel).  It would have been nice if the characters in Buffy had at least mentioned her in passing, but it's as if she never existed.  I guess the memories of Cordy were too traumatic for our heroes.  Finally, we see the unfortunate loss of Oz (Seth Green), as he vacates Sunnydale in an episode that comes off simply feeling forced.
On the plus side, Season Four is one of the more humorous ones, with episodes like ""Beer Bad"" and ""Superstar"" serving up the laughs.  It also contains the Emmy-nominated ""Hush"", written by Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy) himself.  I would pay the entire price of this Season just for that episode alone, given that the DVD also contained enough extras on this unique showing of Whedon's writing talents.  We also see the introduction of Riley (Mark Blucas) and Spike (James Marsters) as regular cast members, and Anya (Emma Caulfield) has a very strong presence as well.
In the end, this is still distinctly Buffy, and worthwhile just for that reason.  Unfortunately, it ultimately does not have the same emotional resonance as Season Two or even Season Three did.  Certainly worth the money, but if you don't have the other seasons on DVD, get them first.",1045872000,,2364,4.788177339901478
1260368,5,B000035Z1M,"For the last seven years, Buffy The Vampire Slayer has been one of the wittiest, intelligent, and well written shows around.  And the last 3 seasons have been released on DVD, much to the delight of fans everywhere.  Fox now is set to release this, the fourth season of Buffy on DVD, and anticipation is high.  How does the fourth season compare to the first 3?  Well, the first season was the show finding itself, and the second reached an all time high with it's strong ending.  Many people considered the third season, the pinnacle of the show's storylines.  While the fourth season is considered weaker than the second and third, it still cranks out some solid TV.
In the fourth season, we see Buffy entering a new era of her life...college.  After the destruction of Sunnydale High, the defeat of the mayor at graduation, and Angel leaving her (for his own show), our favorite slayer starts anew with college life and finds herself dealing with a whole new set of rules...things aren't as simple as they were in high school (if you can call the 1st 3 seasons of Buffy simple).  Season 4 deals with the familiar Scoobies finding out about a military operation on a mission to capture demons and the like.  This group is known only as the Initiative.  In typical fashion, Buffy and her pals become involved with the Initiative through a young agent named Riley, who soon becomes Buffy's new love interest.  But the Initiative holds a secret that not even Riley knows about, a project that will reveal the season's big bad.
While this season's overall plot is weaker than the last, there remains episodes in it that are truly some of the show's best.  Two, which stand out in my opinion, are ""Hush"" in which a group of demons known as the ""Gentlemen"" come to town and steal everyone's voice.  This episode of the show was acclaimed for its silence...the actors, without their voices are reduced to conveying emotion and communication in other ways.  In a sense, a throwback to the silent films of the early days of movies, Buffy and friends are reduced to writing on wipe off boards and primitive sign language.  Prepare yourself for one of TV's funniest moments ever, when Buffy demonstrates for the group how to ""kill"" the gentlemen.
The other classic episode is ""Superstar"" where Jonathan places a spell on the world, in which everyone views him as the perfect person...he starred in the Matrix, invented the internet, and is more powerful than the Slayer.  He's even in the opening credits! Only Buffy begins to sense something is wrong, but how can she hope to overcome this when she can't even slay a vampire without Jonathon's help?
Season four is good TV.  Angel returns in some episodes as his show runs parallel to Buffy and crossovers between the two are welcome. Faith returns to cause some havoc too. Even the weaker of Buffy's years is stronger than most other shows on TV today.  You know this already, and don't need me to tell you otherwise. And just wait until season five.",1045872000,,2993,4.679389312977099
1260369,5,B000035Z1M,"I was concerned BtVS couldn't keep up the standard of the incredible season 3. Some of the slight weakness is caused by the exit of Angel (now spun off into his own series, with some good crossover episodes) and his replacement as love interest by the much less interesting Riley (but, realistically, who could be as interesting as a brooding, tortured, 200 year old cursed vampire?), by the introduction of The Initiative as the seemingly inevitable Secret Government Plot, and by the move from ""vampires as metaphor for high school angst"" to a not quite as clear metaphor at university. However, not all these things are what they initially seem, and Spike at least adds a needed touch of acid -- the writers have resisted the temptation to make him ""good"". So, despite a slight lack of focus and a few weak episodes, there are some very strong ones (in particular, Hush and Who Are You?), some funny ones (especially Superstar), and quite a few twists and turns to keep you guessing, as the characters develop off in new directions. Highlights? Come on, this is BUFFY, it's all highlight. Particular ones to watch include 'Who Are You' which see the aforementioned return of Faith, the off-kilter 'Superstar', 'Primeval' (which out-Bonds 007 himself), the frankly bizarre and prophetic 'Restless' and of course the outstanding 'Hush' which, until season six's 'Once More, With Feeling' will surely have been any BUFFY fan's favourite. Season Four really sets the tone for the next two years. This isn't the same light, frothy teenage show of seasons 1-3. This is something very different altogether. But it's still BUFFY. It's still the best. What more do you want?",1045872000,2,1668,4.93950177935943
1260370,5,B000035Z1M,"Ok, I'll admit it: there are a few things I disliked about season 4 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The main thing being: Riley. Could they have invented a more boring love interest for Buffy? Don't get me wrong, Riley was a very nice guy, I just didn't really care for him. Nor did I really care for that season's ""Big Bad"", Adam. He wasn't a very interesting villain, like the Master, or the Mayor, or especially the latest one, The First Evil.
HOWEVER - Buffy's 4th season had so much to offer. Beginning with the very welcome return of Spike, who became a series regular that season. But more than that, there were some really great, classic episodes. Here are the ones, in my opinion, I thought were the best:
""Something Blue"" was a hilarious episode that foreshadowed two things: the future ""relationship"" between Buffy and Spike, and Willow's magic getting out of hand. In this episode, Willow's spell to help her get over the departure of boyfriend Oz goes terribly wrong and ends in chaos - with Buffy and Spike getting engaged, Giles going blind, and Xander being chased by demons. I think this may actually be the most humerous hour of Buffy ever produced.
""Hush"" was a television first: almost an entire episode of no talking. When The Gentlemen come to town, everyone in Sunnydale loses their voice, so that when The Gentlemen rip their hearts out, no one will hear them scream. Despite the silence, or maybe because of the silence, this is one of Buffy's creepiest episodes ever.
""Restless"" is actually one of my favorite episodes of Buffy. It almost needs multiple viewings to digest everything. Even to this day, when I'm watching reruns from other seasons, I see a new connection to this episode. After their final battle with Adam, the Scooby gang head over to Buffy's house for a movie night. But before the first movie even begins, they are all fast asleep in front of the TV. That's when the nightmares start. I won't get into any details about any of their dreams, but they range from comical to downright frightening. And the episode is a lot more complex than you think, because it reflects on things that have happened in the past, and it foreshadowed events that were to happen in the future (for instance, Tara's warning to Buffy to ""be home before dawn"" was actually a reference to the arrival of Buffy's ""sister"" Dawn in season 5).
I know, I only listed 3 episodes. This does not mean the rest were bad; those were just my favorites. I will say that I'm more excited for the release of this season out of all of them so far, mainly because the above 3 episodes are ones I'm likely to watch again and again. I can't say this is the best season of Buffy, because I don't think there really IS a best - they have all been excellent. However, I do think it is one of the finer seasons. A lot of people didn't like it as well (a lot of people agreed with me on the Riley issue, I think), but I think it was great. The performances were all-around stupendous, and the scripts were well written as usual, with the same hip wit and humor, and with many, many, many quotable lines. This has got to be on every Buffy's fans' wish lists. Even if you don't agree that it was a great season it's a must-have. It will definitely be spending A LOT of time in my DVD player. Now, my only wish is that they would put more special features on these discs. Not that the episodes alone aren't worth the money; it would just be nice if they added more interviews, and maybe some more commentary, especially from cast members. Either way, I'll take what I can get.",1045785600,,3568,4.473926380368098
1260371,5,B000035Z1M,"There are a lot of mixed feelings over Buffy The Vampire Slayer's fourth season, mostly because it's different and although there may be the odd dodgy episode here, the rest is superb.  By taking the gang out of college series creator Joss Whedon made a brave transition that is often very hard to pull off but he manages it.  Many people were upset by the fact that there was no longer a high school, Angel and Cordelia were no longer there, Buffy had a new boyfriend and there was less Giles and Xander.  But it just so happens that Joss knew exactly what he was doing with all of these plot developments, creating interesting and realistic character developments.  The gang couldn't have remained in high school forever, characters move on to different places and new relationships are entirely realistic.  As for less Giles and Xander, yes it was upsetting at the time, but entirely realistic given both characters' fears about being pushed aside by the new college-attending Buffy, Willow, Oz and Tara.
Kicking off the season with one of the best season openers (second only to Buffy Vs. Dracula) is The Freshman.  Showing the first day of college along with all its worries and trauma is so true to life it's uncanny.  I've been through exactly these experiences and yet again Buffy relates them better to screen than anything else on television.  Following this is another in what is fast becoming a tradition of great characters that only appear for one of two episodes.  Kathy the evil roommate, who listens to Cher, puts up Celine Dion posters and irons her jeans - how much more evil can you get?!  Harsh Light Of Day is also a classic for bringing back the ever popular cult character Spike and Anya, both of whom were to become permanent fixtures later on in the season.
Unfortunately there was a mid-season dip around around about Beer Bad, The Initiative and Goodbye Iowa.  The usually gently evoked metaphors of the show are too overt here and the Initiative concept just isn't quite as interesting as other seasons' big bads.  Fortunately there are several episodes here that rank among the best the show has ever produced.  Hush is near perfect and its rare that a show actually has an intelligent message to give whilst still remaining entertaining and original but Buffy does it.  The episode begins with characters discussing the uselessness of communication because you can't put into words how you really feel.  Xander can't define his relationship with Anya, Buffy can't explain her feelings for Riley and Giles doesn't seem to want to talk at all.  So before you can say a word Joss Whedon strikes them all mute in an episode that's high on the creepy factor as the eerie Gentlemen steal the voices of Sunnydale inhabitants.  The episode is also notable for introducing the adorable Tara.
Faith also makes a return appearance for the two-parter This Year's Girl and Who Are You.  For the first time in TV history the stereotypical bad guy has been given the same amount character development as the show's stars and Faith is such a wonderfully complex character that I doubt she'll ever be rivalled.  Extending sympathy towards her loneliness and explaining her descent into murder as a way to shut off the pain of reality, Joss really makes you feel sorry for someone that has killed three people and is fully intent on killing Buffy.  The concluding part to the two-parter is especially enjoyable as a new twist is put on th old formular of good guy and villain switch bodies.  Sarah Michelle Gellar as Faith is simply wonderful, even displaying evidence of Faith's Boston accent.  As Faith tries to ruin everything in Buffy's life she sees for herself exactly what she's missing out on, hasn't got and whilst before she was mocking Buffy's supposed mantra 'Because it's wrong' she finally, at the episode's end, says it and understands what it means.  Followed up by another two-parter in Angel where she seeks redemption This Year's Girl and Who Are You remain as somewhat landmarks in television.
Most people will also probably agree that the two-parter at the end of the series, The Yoko Factor and Primeval are very good indeed, delving into mysticism more than the show has before and pulling together all the issues about the group splitting apart that have been worrying us all season.  However, even this is nothing compared to the masterpiece that is Restless.  Comprised almost entirely of dream sequences the episode works on so many layers that a full analysis of what everything means would be fruitless here (though you are able to find one of the Internet).  Prophesising later events such as Buffy's death, Dawn's arrival and even Anya returning to vengeance the dreams give each character a vision on their own nightmares.  Remember the episode in series 1 which did the same thing, and even the earlier episode of this series, Fear Itself?  Well Restless delves deep into the psychological fears of the characters revealing Willow to be afraid that she's still the same nerdy little girl from high school, only acting out another life.  Xander worries that the others have left him behind and that he'll never catch up, Giles is concerned over whether Buffy really needs him anymore and Buffy faces new fears over the nature of her power and where its roots lie.  A genuinely creepy episode (watch out for Christophe Beck's killer score) this sets things up and pulls them together so well that the hair on the back of your neck will be standing up throughout.  A masterpiece pure and simple, and following last season's Earshot and Graduation Day, and this season's Who Are You and Hush, Restless proves that a genre show doesn't have to be constricted by that genre.  Whilst previously the show was praised for mixing drama, comedy and horror together, it has transformed itself into something entirely different now, something much deeper.  Restless is a foreshadowing of what's to come not only for the characters but for the show itself, as season 5's The Body proves.",1045785600,23,6019,4.840975609756097
1260372,5,B000035Z1M,"Season 4 of Buffy, while not the best (that honor goes to season 5), is still most exceptional television. The overall arc, involving a mysterious government agency known as the Initiative, is quite a change from seasons 1-3, but in my opinion, that's a good thing. Season 4 was the transition season, the middle season, the midpoint between seasons 1-3 and seasons 5-7.
Even if you don't like the main arc (which produces 4 quality episode: ""The I in Team"", ""Goodbye, Iowa"", ""The Yoko Factor"" and ""Primeval""), this set is still well worth your money, since the true power of season 4 is in the dozen or so ""stand-alone"" episodes, i.e., the ones that do not heavily affect the overall arc. But that's what's so good about Buffy, even a fun and light-hearted episode can reveal crucial information that fits in with the season's arc. Among these superb episodes, there are the wonderful (""The Freshman""), the hilarious (""Fear, Itself"", ""Pangs"", ""Something Blue"", ""A New Man"", ""Superstar"") the incredible (""Hush, ""This Year's Girl"", ""Who Are You?"", ""Restless""), and the heartbreaking (""Wild at Heart"", ""New Moon Rising"").
With such a spectacular season, all the special features are just icing on the cake. This set is rumored to have more extras than any other previous Buffy set. There will be 6 commentaries total, two by series mastermind Joss Whedon for both ""Hush"" and ""Restless"".
Overall, this is a set not to be missed, whether or not you're a Buffy fan.",1045699200,5,1460,4.91497975708502

1260375,4,B000035Z1M,"Things change. That pretty much sums up what this season is all about. Change. Things change. People change. It's because of this change that had many fans undecided about this season of the wonderful show. The departure from the world of high school where you knew your place and the world around you is hard on everyone. You leave to come to a new world and everything is different. I was kind of disappointed with it when I first saw it in it's original airing, but repeated viewings over the years has changed my thoughts and the season was much better than it first appeared. There is still plenty to love here with season four. Buffy Summers and best friend Willow are going to college at UC Sunnydale. It's a different life now. No more high school. Giles is no longer her watcher. Xander isn't going with them. Buffy, for the first time, is completely out of her element, but Willow is in hers. This season showcases just how lives and friendships can change when high school is over and you step into a completely different world. The season premiere, ""The Freshman"", pretty much sums it all up and shows how it's going to be. Buffy battles a clan of vampires who attack freshmen and then make it look like they left because they couldn't take college life. Buffy's more on her own than she ever has been before. She is sharing a dorm room with an incredibly perky girl named Kathy, who loves Celine Dion and spins Cher all day long. This is taken further in ""Living Conditions"". Spike returns in fine form in ""The Harsh Light Of Day"". He is searching for the gem of amara, which is a ring that will enable a vampire to be in sunlight. The conclusion of this episode is the 'Angel' season one episode, ""In The Dark"". Spike later returns and soon becomes a full time cast member. Buffy jumps on the Halloween theme with ""Fear, Itself"", a great follow up to season two's ""Halloween"". This one has the gang attending a Halloween party at a fraternity, where everyone's greatest fears come to life. It's also during the course of this season that we lose Oz(Seth Green). In ""Wild At Heart"", he is caught with a female werewolf named Veruca. She tries to kill Willow until Oz gets to her. He decides to leave and figure out who he is. He reappears in episode 19, ""New Moon Rising"", where he has controlled the wolf and wants Willow back. But Willow is now with a fellow wicca named Tara(Amber Benson). The realization of Willow being gay was handled so well and in such a respective manner. It wasn't made into a big deal and they didn't bang us over the head with it. Big kudos to Joss Whedon and company. Especially Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson. The rest of the season is filled with ups and downs. The worst episode of the season is ""Beer Bad"". College jocks turn into prehistoric cavemen after drinking beer laced with a potion. It's so bad, but this is Buffy, and they are allowed to give us one bad ep since they give us nothing but good ones usually. Faith awakens from her coma and returns in two of the best episode of the season, ""This Year's Girl"", which also features an appearance from the mayor, and in ""Who Are You?"". The first one has Faith given a gift from the long dead Mayor that will allow her and Buffy to switch bodies. This is where the second episode goes. The conclusion of this arc ends in L.A. on two episodes of ""Angel"", called ""Five By Five"", and ""Sanctuary"". Two fabulous episodes. We are also introduced to Riley(Marc Blucas), a TA who befriends Buffy. We later learn that Riley is an operative for the government working in their headquarters under the college. He and the rest capture monsters and others and experiment on them. The organization is runned by one of Buffy's professors, Maggie Walsh(played by veteran actress Lindsey Crouse). The initiative thing never really worked for me. Riley never clicked. He had tough shoes to fill after Angel. This is by no means Blucas' fault. He just wasn't developed. Spike is also captured by the team and has a chip put into his head that will keep him from attacking humans by sending a shock thru his brain. The main villain, a monster hybrid named Adam, is first introduced in ""The I In Team"". His main plan is to overcrowd the initiative with humans and monsters and start a war to have corpses to use to start his own race of hybrid monsters. This is obviously the weakest story arc the show has had. Adam was introduced way too late and wasn't given enough time to develop himself or his plan. It just didn't work. It was a real disappointment. The real stand out of this season is the incredible and brilliant ""Hush"". Half of the episode without dialogue and also features some of the creepiest monsters the show has had. The best episode ever. ""The Initiative"", ""Pangs"", ""Doomed"", ""Where The Wild Things Are"",
and ""Superstar"" are all fine, but mostly are file and forget it episodes. ""The Yoko Factor"" has Spike trying to tear the scooby gang apart, which is something that has been slowly happening this season anyway. Angel also appears in this episode and we finally see him and Riley meet. ""Restless"", the finale, is a mind blowing episode. It's all dreams and it feels like a dream. A perfectly executed episode. Season four is not, by far, the show's best season. It has exceptional episodes, and some that aren't so exceptional. After such perfectly executed first three seasons, this one just feels uneven all the way through. It's not the weakest season(that would be season six), but it just doesn't gel all the time. The cast is still top notch and still shows that they are some of the finest assembled casts to be on television. It's hard to watch our friends in such a different environment and kind of lose the closeness they had. But that's what the show has always done. Tried to be true to life, and they always succeed. They do here, but it's kind of hard to watch. But even when it's not always clicking or at it's best, ""Buffy"" is still head and shoulders above most everything else. The good episodes here are just exactly that, and there are plenty. But the mediocre and uneveness of the season and some episodes get in the way, and keep it from getting the full five stars. It's a real good season, but not near up to par as the first three. Season five was a glorious return to form.",1045526400,2,6305,4.526730937773882
1260385,5,B000035Z1M,"Many changes happened in the fourth season of Buffy. First, there was no Angel. Second, no Cordelia. Three: Introduction of Riley, Four, intoruduction of Tara. While Season 4 was not one of the best seasons of the series it gave us some of the shows best episodes including the emmy nominated Hush, which to this day still remains one of best episodes in television history.
 Season 4 was basically about Buffy getting use to life in college. Its there she meets Riley who is part of an underground military operation called The Initiative. The focus of the season is Buffy fighting against Adam, who was created by Prof. Walsh, the leader of the Initiative and Buffys professor.
 The season starts off strongly with the hilarious episode Living Conditions when Buffy thinks her new, annoying roomate is a demon and Fear Itself, when the scoobies are trapped in a haunted frat house. The show tends to slow down the pace a bit as it starts to revolve more about Riley and The Initiative, but things pick back up in Hush, when we meet Tara and we get to see Alyson Hannigans Willow evolve into a woman and powerful witch.
Tara, played by Amber Benson, is a nice addition the cast who has a big effect on Willow in more ways than one. Marc Blucas as Riley is very blah, but you get use to him, and actually start to feel sorry for him.
 Things also pick up when Faith comes out of her coma and is intent on making Buffy pay for what she did to her. Who Are You? and This years Girl are two excellent episodes.
 The season ends on a high note as we get to a glimpse as to whats to come in Season 5, the most exciting season of the series. Although one of the weaker seasons, Buffy still manages to make us laugh, cry, and keep us on the edge of our seats. Sarah Michelle Gellar remains the heart of the show, but in this season we finally get to see the character of Willow blossom into something very powerful.",1045440000,,1908,4.366197183098592
1260386,4,B000035Z1M,"The worst season so far ONLY because it has the Inigitive,Adam and Riley. It does have it's good moment though like when Angel and Faith return in a few episodes,""Hush"" was the most terrorizing episode ever,""fear Itself""on Halloween everyone's fears come true and ""Living Conditions"" was hilarious! This is the season when Willow Rosenberge relises she is a lesbian and finds her true soul mate,Tarah who is also a witch.",1045353600,,421,5.0285714285714285
1260387,5,B000035Z1M,"A Great season compared to the outstanding 3rd season. While there is not much of an appearance by Faith, we get a small dose of her until the highly expected return of Faith close to the end of Season 7. I highly recommend this dvd boxed set. The Big Bad is great this season, but not as creative as the last season. Also the Buffy Seasons are getting released quicker as they go along. Expect the 5th Season of Buffy to get a release date some where between Oct 1, and Jan. 2004. I do believe Glory is the best Big Bad thus far.

1260388,5,B000035Z1M,"Season 3 & 4 are by far the best seasons of BTVS! Season 4 is great, it has original story ideas, and its just a really great show and season.",1045353600,,142,3.7666666666666666
1260389,4,B000035Z1M,"After the first three seasons, fans began to expect a lot from Buffy. Unfortunately, season four doesn't quite live up. The first mistake was the introduction of Riley. He could have been an interesting character, but ended up being a subpar Angel substitute.
  The ""Big Bad"" of season four was a government conspiracy. A departure from the vampires and demons fans grew used to. It was a welcome change, but in the end, it didn't have the same effect as, say, the baddies of the first three seasons.
  The best things about this season are the episodes ""Hush"" and ""Restles,"" and the introduction of Tara. ""Hush"" is not only one of the best episodes the series has produced, but it also proved that you could have an episode where no one said anything for almost half of it. ""Restless"" was just a really cool episode, and Tara evolved into one of the best, and underrated, characters of the next two seasons.
  All in all, it's a decent season of television, though not always at the level you'd expect after the early years.",1045267200,,1025,4.604395604395604
1260390,5,B000035Z1M,"In my opinion, Season 4 is a superb season. Yes, it's different to all the rest but that's what gives the show depth and substance; it'd be a bit boring if Buffy slayed a few vampires in every single episode. Joss Whedon took a bold decision in making Season 4 different. Most viewers hated the fact that Angel and Cordelia were gone, there was the wood-like Riley and Buffy, Willow, Xander and Oz were out of high school. At least Whedon had the courage and faith in the show to take the transition it needed. Overall I think the first 11 episodes of Season 4 (all in this Box Set) are the best ""first-half"" episodes of any of the seasons - they're all good and unique in their own way.

Season 4 opens with the explosive ""The Freshman."" The fourth consecutive season opener to be written and directed by Joss Whedon, we see Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) not coping too well as a freshman at UC Sunnydale. In a wrenching role of reversal from probably the first-ever Buffy episode, Willow is the confident girl while Buffy feels insecure and lonely; she is kicked out of Pop Culture class for talking (a subject she really wanted to take), is annoyed by her new roommate Kathy (Dagney Kerr) (who's a fan of Celine Dion and Cher) and gets her butt kicked by a super-strong female vamp called Sunday. Along with a few more vamps, Sunday wreaks havoc among freshmen at UC Sunnydale by stealing all their possessions and killing the owner. After a lot of sulking and moaning, Buffy is reunited with Xander in the Bronze - he's been travelling America for months, yet only got far as Oxnard and ended up working as a male stripper and cleaning dishes! Buffy gets her act on and eventually slays Sunday and her crew after they steal all of her gear.

In ""Living Conditions,"" we learn a lot more about Buffy's roommate Kathy. Buffy thinks she's so annoying - she snores, she writes her name all over her food with labels, she wears Buffy's clothes without permission and she listens to awful diva-like music! Buffy is tipped over the edge by all this and starts acting crazing, making the assumption that Kathy is an evil demon after they both have simultaneous nightmares involving force-feeding blood, scorpions and chanting. In the end, Buffy proves to be correct and battles Kathy - in demon form and sends her all the way back to the Hell she came from. In ""The Harsh Light Of Day,"" Spike (James Marsters) and Harmony (Mercedes McNab) return to the show. The latter is now a vampire and Spike's girlfriend after she was turned a vampire in the Season 3 finale ""Graduation Day Part 2."" This is an emotionally tough episode for Buffy. She gets chatting with Parker (Adam Kaufman) before consequently making love. The next morning, he wants nothing to do with her. Buffy feels betrayed and hurt. She also has to deal with Spike who can walk around in broad daylight with the help of a gem. ""Fear Itself"" is the next episode and a superb one at that! It's the Halloween episode that occurs every two seasons - this is without a doubt the best. The Scoobies get locked in a house on Halloween, which is possessed by a demon Gachnar thanks to Oz - accidentally. The final demon is hilarious. To quote Willow, ""He...he's so cute!""

The next two episodes that follow are ""Beer Bad"" and ""Wild At Heart."" Both are pretty rubbish. In the former, Buffy gets drunk with a gang of unknown guys - but the beer she's consuming is drugged with a substance that turns her into a caveman...in a way. She can't speak properly and doesn't know who the Scoobies are - overall, a funny but lame episode. In the latter, Oz (Seth Green) is drawn to Veruca (Paige Moss) who turns out to be another werewolf just like him. They end up waking up together naked - yet Willow (Alyson Hannigan) gets the wrong idea and thinks they slept together when Oz actually did it to make sure she wouldn't harm anyone by locking her in the same cage as him on a full moon night. In the end, Oz leaves Sunnydale in a flurry not telling Willow where he's going. Willow is heart-broken.

In ""The Initiative,"" we learn a lot more about Buffy's would-be boyfriend Riley (Marc Blucas). Buffy's happy thinking Riley's a typical kinda guy, but she doesn't know he works as a soldier in The Initiative - a secret government military operation that captures demons/vampires and performs tests on them. Riley in turn doesn't know Buffy is the Slayer - but they come very close to finding out each other's identities. ""Pangs,"" the next episode, is a Buffy/Angel crossover episode in which Angel (David Boreanaz) visits Buffy - yet she doesn't know. He lurks in the background watching her. It's thanksgiving and Buffy wants a perfect traditional meal - but first she has to deal with a Chumash tribe!

""Something Blue"" is probably the funniest Buffy episode that I have ever seen. Willow isn't coping too well with Oz's departure from Sunnydale so decides to perform a spell to make the grieving fly by. The spell goes wrong and everything she says comes true - next thing you know, Buffy and Spike are getting married, Giles is going blind and Xander (Nicholas Brendon) is being chased around by demons! The next episode is the classic ""Hush."" Hush is considered a ground-breaking piece of television in that it's almost completely silent. The episode was nominated for an Emmy and has earned classic status amongst Buffy fans. I won't spoil it for you because it's just so excellent, but I will say that it's very revealing towards the end! ""Doomed"" is the next episode. In this average episode, three demons plan on re-opening the Hellmouth in the library of Sunnydale High School. Buffy and Riley both know who they are; Slayer, commando etc. so go vampire slaying from now on. In other storylines, Willow meets Tara (Amber Benson) in a Wicca-group. They become good friends in Hush - a friendship that leads to love and Anya (Emma Caulfield) returns and starts going out with Xander. Overall a superb first-half to Season 4...",1045180800,11,5977,4.634905660377359
1260391,1,B000035Z1M,"I LOVE Buffy, it is one of the best shows out there. This is by far the Worst season EVER. I mean come on, a group of army guys makle this almost invincible killing machine made of demon and human parts. And then you add the whole Riley relationship. Even the sixth season was better than this. The only reason im going to buy this DVD when it comes out is because i want the whole collection. The only good part about it is when Faith comes in to mess things up. The whole reason why it wasn't that good is the fact that they had very little, to no, character developements.  That and the whole fact of how the only new character introduced in this season who lasted for longer than the middle of season 5 was Tara, big plus.  Riley is obviously the wrong guy for buffy and you can tell that from the beginning.  He has to live up to his predecessor, Angel, and he does not do a good job of it.  Since buffy's the slayer, she has to be with someone dangerous, and riley is obviously not one of them.  Another main thing that the producers learned quickly, thank god, is that Buffy isn't a college girl, they tried to make the college like Sunnydale High, which did not work out very well.  They only had a few shining moments in this season; the bringing about of the first slayer, bringing willows relationship with tara, putting the chip in spike's head, and when Tara says ""You think you know what you are?, whats to come?  You've only just begun.""  which leads to the clincher of season 5.",1045094400,6,1494,4.273049645390071
1260392,5,B000035Z1M,"The Angelus story arc from the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer that is captured so perfectly in the three volumes of The Buffy & Angels Chronicles begins with the double punch of ""Surprise"" and ""Innocence"" and the transformation of Angel into Angelus after his Faustian moment of true happiness.  Angel's final tragic confrontation with Buffy in ""Becoming, Part 2"" had been a long time coming, set up by Josh Whedon the first time the starcrossed lovers met, and confirming once and for all that Buffy is one of the best series on television.
""Surprise,"" written by Marti Noxon and directed by Michael Lange, is the calm before the storm.  On her seventeenth birthday Buffy has been having prophetic dreams again (never a good sign).  The Scooby gang learns that Spike and Drusilla are trying to reassemble the Judge, who was dismembered long ago because he cannot be killed ""by any weapon forged.""  We learn that Jenny Calendar is really Janna, a member of the Romany gypsies that cursed Angel and restored his soul.  Warned by her uncle that Angel is becoming too happy, Jenny gets Angel to agree to take the arm of the Judge on a long ocean voyage.  But when vampires recapture the arm and complete the Judge, Angel and Buffy spend the night together.  The episode, in which Angel finally tells Buffy that he loves her, ends with only a hint of what has happened, a subtle change in Angel as Buffy lies sleeping.  (Note: There was a scene cut from this episode in which Jenny and Giles talk have a very serious talk about Buffy that you can find in the first volume of ""The Watcher's Guide."")
In ""Innocence,"" written and directed by series creator Josh Whedon, Angel has lost his soul and Angelus is back big time, joining Spike and Drusilla in their effort to destroy the world with the Judge.  At first Angel just blows off Buffy, but after he attacks Willow and the Slayer forces the truth from Jenny, the truth is out and everybody has to start dealing with the consequences.  Angelus decides he is going to torture Buffy the way he did Drusilla before he turned her.  Buffy is not the only one with love life complications, as Willow catches Xander and Cordelia kissing and Oz rejects her offer to make out.  However, the immediate concern is the Judge, and Buffy gets around the ""no weapon forged"" rule by adding a missle launcher to her arsenal.  Getting a chance to take down Angelus at the end, she makes her point with the toe of her boot rather than a stake.  She might regret that decision.  (Note: The Judge is played by Brian Thompson, who played the Master's right-hand vamp Luke in the pilot episodes).
The Angelus story arc concludes brilliantly in the two-parter ""Becoming"" seasone finale.  The nice thing about The Buffy & Angle Chronicles is that of the six episodes inbetween these bookend two-parters, they choose the two best--""Passion"" and ""I Only Have Eyes For You""--for inclusion in Volume 2.  Together, the episodes on these tapes represent the heart of soul of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.",971481600,6,3027,4.702651515151516
1260393,5,B000035Z1M,"I was so happy when my Buffy and Angel Gift Pack arrived- three cassettes!  Since I'd only read BTVS books and none of the episodes (no cable), my  expectations for these 6 episodes were quite high. Now, all I have to say  is: It was everything I hoped it would be and more.
The first cassette  contains Episodes `Surprise' and `Innocence', and is coloured in red  shades. In Surprise, it's Buffy's 17th birthday, and her friends are  planning a surprise party. Buffy's feeling far from festive. Her feelings  for Angel have become too hot to handle, and her sleep is disturbed by  nightmares of his death. In those dreams, Drusilla and Spike are planning a  party of their own. When Buffy learns they're assembling the body of a  demon called the judge, she and Angel must crash that party to stop the  destruction of humanity.
In Innocence, the evil Angelus is back. After  one moment of true happiness with Buffy, Angel's curse is broken and he is  once again the demonic Angelus. It's now like the old times with Spike and  Dru, who have assembled The Judge and plan to destroy the world. But  Angelus has his own agenda: to torture Buffy, who had once made him feel  human. Meanwhile, Xander comes up with a plan to destroy The Judge, though  it' written that `no weapon forged' can stop the demon.
BTVS Vol. 1 is a  great introduction to the B & A Chronicles with an interview with Joss  Wendon, the creator at the end of the two episodes. There are sub plots as  well, including Xander and Cordelia, and Willow and Oz, as well as the true  identity of Jenny Calendar as Yanna from a gypsy tribe.
I still think  it's better to get the Gift Pack than the individual tapes because the  experience won't be the same. You're worth it so don't cut yourself short.",968025600,12,1764,4.495268138801261
