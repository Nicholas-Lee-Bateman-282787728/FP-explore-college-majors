3964174,5,B002PAD2I0,"Ah poirot, what more can you say? Wonderful set of DVD's. Would recommend to anybody who's a fan of Poirot or Agatha Christie, or mystery's or detective stories or just a good story period. David Suchet and the rest of the players are spot on.

3964175,3,B002PAD2I0,I was expecting more from this Blu-ray set. My mistake I guess. I didn't know all the writing would be in Spanish and it should have come with directions on how to get to each program on the disc. It was also grainy in places which I did not expect. If you speak Spanish you may have less trouble than I have had.,1376179200,4,313,3.984126984126984
