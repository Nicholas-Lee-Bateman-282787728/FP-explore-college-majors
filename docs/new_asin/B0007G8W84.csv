2211501,4,B0007G8W84,"Once you learn the basics, this is a great overall cardio workout! I love the Brazilian costumes -- it makes it more like a party and less like exercise. And Edilson is easy on the eyes.",1111017600,3,186,4.194444444444445
8047145,5,B0007G8W84,"I've been dancing samba for some years and I must say that this is an awesome video! Great choreography. The instructor has an awesome personality, so even though you're sweating you touche off, you still have fun. I take this video with me when I'm traveling so if I can't make it to the gym, I can have this to do. I never get tired of it. Worth the money.",1336780800,,358,4.128571428571429
8047146,5,B0007G8W84,"This is my review of 5 of my 6 samba videos.

Samba Party Workouts 1 and 2 by Vanessa Isaac are fun workouts. As others have pointed out they are pretty basic. Since most people don't know much about Samba I assume this is done purposely to ease people into unfamiliar movements. If you don't have a strong dance background or want a slow, clear introduction to some basic samba movements, I would recommend these as a good starting point. She explains things very clearly and there is a section you can use to review individual movements slowly with additional explanation. If you know some samba, have alot of dance experience, or are looking for a challenge I recommend the SamBody Workout. I've been doing salsa/merengue/bachata off and on for about 12 years and I've been doing swing dancing for the past 7. I find that Sambody gives me a run for my money. It's a ton of fun but it will take me a few workouts to get the moves down. I like all of them but SamBody definitely challenges me quite a bit. It's super fun!! I also like the World Dance workout by Elsa Leandros. It has a Samba segment along with several other dances and will give you a couple extra moves to spice things up if you really want to pick up a variety of moves.

I did the Samba Party 1 dvd, using the instructional section first, and was able to do all the moves the first time without any problems. I did Samba Party 2 right afterwards, again using the instructional segment first, and was able to complete it with ease the first time. They were both fun and I could see myself doing these moves on a social dance floor. Later in the week I did Elsa's dvd which was a little more challenging since it covers several dancestyles. I did the instructional section first and found the workout to be fun and it gave me a good workout. It had some fun samba moves that were not covered in Vanessa's dvds. The next day I tried the SamBody workout -Basic Steps. It was fun but I couldn't quite get all the steps on the first go, even with some rewinding. It's faster pace with alot more movements performed overall. I think my brain got a little overloaded. I haven't tried my SamBody -Advanced Routines 1 yet but I did watch it and it looks fun. I can't wait to work my way up to it!",1149465600,,2257,4.320754716981132
8047147,5,B0007G8W84,"I don't know why some people insist to think that in Brazil we speak Spanish and dance Salsa, Merengue, Rumba or Tcha Tcha, like in other Central and South American Countries.  Brazil is famous for S A M B A and Carnaval!!! For your information in Sambody video you'll find authentic Samba steps, unlike in the Zumba video! If you like Brazilian Culture and want to learn real Samba, this instructional video is for you! It's worth to have even just to watch the Carnaval Party with the incredible costumes from Rio de Janeiro. Highly Recommended!!!",1118016000,4,549,4.71875
8047148,5,B0007G8W84,This is a must have video.  The music by Paulinho Garcia and Geraldo De Oliveira is fantastic and just makes you want to move.
