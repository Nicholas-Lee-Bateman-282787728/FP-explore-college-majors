6647779,1,B00NEZGRY6,"this was not for me, maybe I've gotten to old, or I don't get stoned or my perception of entertainment has changed or I don't really know! all I've got say is BRO- WHY DID I BUY THIS?",1426723200,,183,3.8421052631578947
6647780,1,B00NEZGRY6,"This atrocity is an insult to the audience. There is no story, it is a collection of inane events each used as an excuse to display boorish and demented behavior. This will be a career ender for a lot people who are already dead enders.",1426723200,3,236,4.266666666666667

6647782,5,B00NEZGRY6,"My daughter was in this movie with her friend, Albert Minero, Jr. This was only a few days before she passed away. It was great to see her smiling face on the big screen. Thank you!",1421020800,,181,4.055555555555555
6647783,5,B00NEZGRY6,"Such a hilarious movie. If you're in need of cheering up, or just want to laugh a lot watch this movie. My favorite character was Cal, played by Albert Minero Jr. He had me laughing so much I was in tears. He also had a super quality dramatic scene. Very solid actor. I hope to see him in more movies soon!",1414195200,,306,4.032786885245901
6647784,5,B00NEZGRY6,"With such a cool cast, I had expected the movie to be funny. What I hadn't expected was the great character development, plot twists and witty dialogue. Had to watch it a couple of times just so I could make sure I didn't miss anything.

It's as good as any film in this genre, well directed and fun. Hilarious plot twists and the zany characters are engaging and fun to watch. I'm going to buy this to give as gifts because I laughed throughout the whole movie and I want to share the fun. Well written and directed.  And some very interesting casting choices. Check it out. ;)",1413849600,2,578,4.342592592592593
6647785,3,B00NEZGRY6,"Based on the success of ""The Hangover"" series we are presented with another teen sex comedy based on not being able to remember what happened the night before.

Unlike the other knock off films, this one has some original and better constructed humor, i.e. it is better than most of the other me-too Hangover films. Jamie Kennedy plays MF Bob (you do the math) a laid back character in a room full of party animals. As they try to piece things out, everyone has their own memory as to what happened, where of course they see themselves in a better light than what everyone else sees them.

If you are into crude humor, this one has it and is perhaps done a bit better.

F-bomb, sex, and nudity. Plenty of young topless women.",1413676800,5,725,4.43609022556391
