4665608,3,B005ELEMV8,"Set in the 1950's during the Suez Crisis, a fledgling BBC news program wrestles with the responsibility to tell the truth in the face of government pressure.  In some ways, this is a paean to the BBC by the BBC.  It includes an array of top flight British actors, including Dominic West, Anton Lesser, Tim Pigott-Smith, Juliet Stevenson and Anna Chancellor and generally manages to hold our attention and highlight important issues.

The production values are very strong, the sets beautiful, the lighting evocative.  Ben Whishaw gives a standout performance as the working class journalist, Freddie Lyon, and Dominic West is superb as an upper class Oxbridge news anchor who is sometimes a little thick between the ears and a little overheated in the nether regions.

My problem is with the script and my problem will not be a problem for all.  The six-episode series attempts to be all things to all people.  At the center of the story is a news/crisis/political pressure plot.  That is related to an MI6 espionage plot in which a female friend of journalist Freddie Lyon (in whose country home he was protected during the war) has been murdered to keep her from revealing sensitive information.  Meanwhile, the news anchor is having an affair with his producer, a producer who is a spunky television journalist trying to break the old boys' glass ceiling and carve out a more important place for women at the Beeb.  From one perspective there is something here for everyone: political/journalistic/television history; a story of espionage/suspense; a story of the British class system and its seemingly endless tentacles; a woman-in-the-workplace story of courage in the face of struggle; and a tale of passion and sex in that same workplace.

For some this will answer every need.  For me, this is a script in search of a focus, any one of which would have worked well.  However, instead of a tight narrative we get a cover-all-the-bases pastiche.  This results in significant problems with tone.  On the one hand, e.g., we have a wonderful action scene in which men fight with knives.  At the same time we get a hilarious scene in which an addled guest on the show, `The Hour', tells the anchor/host about the best driving routes from Biggin Hill to central London, with serious warnings concerning the traffic on Bayswater Road.  The scene is worthy of the Pythons at their best, but it jostles with the scene of a realistic knife fight.

Everyone is smoking, of course, everywhere and always, as realism demands, and they're also drinking, everywhere and always.  Too much `realism', however, becomes distracting and the cigarettes become crutches, the acting too mannered.

Still and all, check it out for yourself.  You might love it.  Don't be put off by the first episode, which starts very slowly.  The final episodes have much more urgency.",1321142400,9,2853,4.947478991596639
4665609,5,B005ELEMV8,"Someone got me watching The Hour by telling me it was like a British Mad Men. I don't disagree, but it's far better than that description implies (and I love Mad Men). The acting is superior to nearly everything on TV today, and the character-development is quite rich given there are only 6 delicious episodes. It's very smartly written--like a British Aaron Sorkin teleplay. If you like suspense and you are smart, you will like this series.",1320710400,,443,4.766233766233766
4665610,4,B005ELEMV8,"The strengths of this series are clear -- the setting is fun, the characters are engaging, some of the performances are brilliant (Anna Chancellor as Lix Storm in particular), and the mysteries seem deep, dangerous, and compelling to the audience as they are to the characters on screen. The weaknesses are harder to discuss without giving away crucial plot points. Suffice it to say that the script cheats at times -- secret codes that seem much more at home in a pulp novel than real life, a trained killer in pursuit of one of our protagonists kills himself at the last minute for no reason the audience can fathom. The mystery that sets the plot in motion turns out to involve two separate revelations -- one about the British government and one about the Soviets. The latter is trite and unbelievable. That said, the series was better than most, and if the BBC should produce a second season I will surely watch it.

[Amendment of September 2012: There is a second series coming! I've even been able to watch the first two episodes, and they're great. Hooray for the BBC.]",1319673600,4,1077,4.668421052631579
4665611,5,B005ELEMV8,"If you like the great Le Carre  and alas, this means mainly the Cold War Le Carre), this is the series for you.  The New Yorker calls it ""chocolate, gold, the love of your life returning your love forever all wrapped in one package,"" or words to that effect.  They got that right.  Brilliantly written, wonderfully acted, stylishly filmed, and very, very intelligent.  Plus it's actually about something.  Beats the hell out of ""Good Night and Good Luck"" (and that was pretty damn good).",1316649600,2,487,4.738095238095238
4665612,3,B005ELEMV8,"The actors are good. The writing -- according to the writer, quoted in WIKIPEDIA -- is hit or miss, with some plot elements working and some not.

It's very important to view the show as a typical mystery. Historical mysteries are very popular today, and that includes mysteries that take place in the 1920s, 40s or 50s. As a historical mystery, this is one drawer below the top. It has errors like the daring, rule-breaking reporter constantly hassling and harrying the mother of a woman who has just died, saying the mother is lying, covering up a murder, and so on. He's right, and he's right to say the mother is doing all that because she's terrified of what will happen to her remaining family if she doesn't keep lying -- but hey, gang, he's not exactly right to keep hassling her during her dreadful grief and fear. It turns out she never gives him any useful information anyway, so all the harrying is just to prove he stops for no one, and we can admire him if we want to.

As any kind of serious discussion of feminist concerns in the 1950s, or the guilt of the British government, the show doesn't work at all. Those things are mere background to the mystery story, and their plausibility IN THIS PARTICULAR DRAMA is exactly the same as the knife fight between college professors (!) on a subway platform and the obvious government cars that follow the hero all over. Dominic West does a good job acting, but his main function is to be a suspect, not to be a person. The same is true for many other characters.

In the last episode, it turns out everyone we care about is really on the side of the good guys after all! (I can't make that clearer without spoilers.) It's the usual mystery cop-out, and just as bad and cowardly as anything poor Sir Anthony Eden's government does in this silly political drama. Only it's not a silly political drama; it's an okay mystery story with government malfeasance to make it historically interesting.

In other words, expect less and your reward will be greater, though still short of great.",1316304000,6,2042,4.555858310626703
4665613,5,B005ELEMV8,"The Hour is currently being shown on BBC America, and the important thing I wanted to let people know about is that if you are not very happy with what you have seen on BBC America, don't blame it on the drama.  In the UK, the length of each episode (without commercials) is 60 minutes.  On BBC America, the episode WITH COMMERCIALS is squeezed into a 60-minute time slot.  If you feel that you are missing something (approximately 10 minutes?) while watching it on BBC America, YOU ARE, and the drama suffers accordingly.  The good news is that this DVD contains the full episodes.

I enjoyed watching this mystery (the full episodes).  The drama unfolds well, and the cast is excellent.  I can't say enough about the cast. I would watch any show with only one of the following actors: Ramola Garai, Anna Chancellor, Jamie Parker (Scripps from The History Boys), Juliet Stevenson, Tim Pigott-Smith, or Julian Rhind-Tutt.  Lucky for me that they all are in this series. There are many other recognizable and talented actors (aka Masterpiece alumni): Dominic West, john Bowe, Andrew Scott and Nicholas Woodeson.  While I was not familiar with the Ben Whishaw's work, I will now add him to my list of must view actors.

My engagement in the drama grew throughout the six hours.  By the end, I had to know how it was going to turn out.  My only criticism is that it leaves a lot of loose ends on what happens to the people involved in the drama.  Presumably, this allows more freedom for the second series, which has been approved by the BBC, but it bothered me.  Still, I gave it five stars.  I did like the mystery and its solution.

I guess I can't blame BBC America for thinking that it can cut 10 minutes or so out of each hour. PBS does it with Masterpiece, and I was shocked to read that the Torchwood: Miracle Day is 60 minutes in the UK and only 50 minutes on Starz.  That really upsets me.  At least PBS' Masterpiece is free.  I pay a lot of money each month to watch truncated shows on Starz?  What is this world coming to?  So much for the free market and capitalism.",1315526400,46,2076,4.453580901856764
4665614,5,B005ELEMV8,"Summer seems to be test time for new series for the television audience  and so far the shows that are coming out of Britain look the most promising. First we had the abbreviated 3 episode appetizer ZEN which in its short run got progressively more interesting and promising and now come THE HOUR from BBC America. The series just debuted in what appeared to be prolonged trailer for the long series that hopefully will continue: the title refers to a television news broadcast that is created before our eyes, the final scenes being a toast to this new venture acting as an overture to what is to come.

Overtures to operas usually introduce themes that will appear in the opera that follows once the curtain opens and that is how THE HOUR comes across.  This is a time piece set in the 1950s when Cold War-era England was awash in the news of the  Suez crisis, one of Britain's sharpest intimations of loss, with a more intimate look at sex, ambition and espionage in the workplace along with the world wide speculation of JFK as a vice presidential candidate in the US. It's a time of unsettling change, except at the BBC, where even driven reporters are assigned to do feel-good newsreels about debutante balls and royal visits. The series opener, written by Bafta Award-winning Abi Morgan, takes us behind the scenes of the launch of a topical news program in London 1956, and introduces a highly competitive, sharp-witted and passionate love triangle at the heart of the series through the lives of enigmatic producer Bel Rowley (Romola Garai) and her rivals, journalist Freddie Lyon (Ben Wishaw) and anchorman Hector Madden (Dominic West): we will begin to see the decade on the threshold of change - from the ruthless sexual politics behind the polite social faade of the Fifties to the revelations that redefined the world for a new generation. Aside from the behind the scenes views and devious workings of the BBC we also see the beginning of a crime element in which the victim is touted as being part of a robbery while the ever-suspicious and career climbing Freddie sees it as a murder to be investigated.  There are 1950s reminders of Debutante Balls, the universal cigarette smoking habits, the 'gentlemen only clubs' where women are not allowed (secondary citizens, you know!), and all the clothes and hats that reek of the 50s.

The cast is rich in fine British actors (Juliet Stevenson and Tim Pigott-Smith appear briefly in roles that will likely be expanded, Anna Chancellor is the acid tongued foreign correspondent, Burn Gorman is the suspicious, hatted man, etc), but if were only Ben Wishaw and Romola Garai and Domenic West every week the show would sail.  There is a lot of style and sophistication and just the right amount of British intrigue and humor that almost sure that this series will fly.

4665615,3,B005ELEMV8,"A coworker recommended THE HOUR knowing that I am a history buff. Set in 1956, THE HOURS focuses on two major incidents - the tragic uprising Hungary against Soviet occupation and Egypt taking control of the Suez Canal from the British and French. An exciting new news show is starting on the BBC called THE HOUR and it deals with these two incidents that could inflame international tensions.

THE HOURS is off to a good start. It has mystery, romance, espionage and the changing values of 1956 Britain. There is a murder in the ""tube"" of a prominent professor and a mysterious new Russian language expert at the BBC. The tension builds as an attractive young woman becomes producer of THE HOUR in a male-dominated business. Soon she becomes romantically involved with the host of the show. Male-female stereotypes ensue destroying the idea of a woman finally earning her way to produce a TV show.

I have mixed feelings about THE HOUR. It does a great job in exploring two major international incidents of 1956 that are forgotten today. The world was in flux due to the COLD WAR and recovery from WWII. The show does a great job in recreating the look and feel of 1956 London but eventually all the romantic entanglements and espionage become annoying and boring. There is the suggestion the Prime Minister and the government are more than just incompetent but willing to commit murder to keep secrets. Relationships are hard to understand. A government official is always on hand to apparently censure THE HOUR just in case they step over the line. Freedom of speech in Britain appears to be limited.

Of course, it is a talented cast headed by Dominic West as news anchor Hector Madden. I was mesmerized by gorgeous Oona Chaplin as his loving but often betrayed wife.  Unfortunately, the series becomes bogged down in its own story and becomes painfully slow-moving with not much of any resolution. It's not bad. I just always expect more from the BBC.",1462492800,,1956,4.77810650887574

4665622,5,B005ELEMV8," I picked this up mostly out of appreciation for Dominic West, who had a major, breakout role in one of the best programs in broadcast history,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire/dp/B005NFJAWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire</a>. It's intriguing to see him in a vastly different role here, and I gained all the more respect for him when realizing how much work he must have put into getting the Baltimore accent down in The Wire (I had assumed he was a U.S. actor since he was picked as the protagonist in that very American serial, yet he's a Brit).

 The Hour was my introduction to the sultry and talented Romola Garai, who almost instantly enchanted me. The 3rd standout actor in the series is Ben Whishaw as the intellect of the team, but I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the striking Burn Gorman (a face you don't forget, and one that you've probably seen elsewhere), who is among the best of recurring characters.

 As for the plot: Fantastic! It has a little bit of something for everyone, without coming across as stretched too thin. That said, it runs afoul of formulaic television, so some viewers may be slightly frustrated with the lack of what they are accustomed to in programming. I can't think of any drawbacks at the moment, which is unusual when I assess a TV serial. My only regret is that I accidently purchased the DVD rather than the Blu-ray; the picture quality makes me yearn for the Blu-ray version (spend the extra five bucks!)",1425859200,,1517,4.980237154150197

4665627,5,B005ELEMV8,"I'd seen a positive review of the show and the premise seemed interesting, so my husband and I got the first Season of episodes via Netflix. (We would subsequently purchase the second season to watch at our leisure). The performances by Ben Whishaw, Dominic West, Anna Chancellor, and Peter Capaldi, introduced in the second season, are tremendous. Set in the 50s, this is a fictional series about the birth of the BBC's first investigative news show occurring simultaneously during several international crises. Plot lines concern the discovery and investigation of what would turn out to be a complex domestic and international scandal.  Dominic West is the talking head for the show who starts out a completely self-promoting insecure cad but develops into much more because of his interactions with Whitshaw, the idealistically naive upstart reporter. Chancellor plays the seasoned, somewhat hardened and jaded war correspondent, and is terrific. While the plot line develops you are also front-row to the growing pains involved in producing such a show while under the thumb of government and BBC censors, hobbled by the existent technology of the time during pre-cold-war conditions and it's fascinating! The strong performances by the supporting cast including Oona Chaplin (West's wife), Hannah Tointon (central to the scandal), Peter Sullivan (police Commander and West's long-time friend), Tom Burke (rival producer), and Morgan Watkins only add to the quality of the production. I don't want to give away anything but the show is sensational! Suffice it to say, if this genre appeals to you, it's a don't miss!",1420243200,,1621,5.307392996108949

They could muzzle the press and prevent British subjects from getting important news. This series addresses that in a sharp and witty manner. Also its cast is remarkable.

It is a British television drama about tv journalists creating a documentary (The Hour), something like ""60 Minutes"".  It's well plotted and each season (two so far) deals with one or more 50s issues (Suez crisis, race relations).  What makes it special are the characters: complex, sympathetic and largely believeable. Bel, the producer, is a woman navigating work and love at a time when rules were changing. Freddie and Hector as journalists on the show are excellent. In fact all the characters have depth, verisimilitude , as we used to say in English class.

4665648,5,B005ELEMV8,"The Hour takes place in 1956 London and follows two journalists friends, Freddie Lyon (Ben Whishaw) and Bel Rowley (Romola Garai) who, fighting the stiff suits that ran the BBC at the time, try to deliver political and worldwide news in an engaging way.

As the story starts, the BBC has approved a new news program, The Hour. Bel has been named producer and Freddie is about to be interviewed for the post of chief anchor. Freddie does not get the post though, and for once, his cockiness and unrepentant, strong opinions, are not the only reason. The post had already been given to Hector Madden (Dominic West), due to his family connections, and, possibly, his good looks.

Under Bel's insistence Freddie joins The Hour as a journalist and, against her advice, investigates the deaths of a professor, who was more than it seemed, and of a young debutant who happened to be his childhood friend.

Spies, corrupt politicians (a repetion according to Mark Twain), rampant sexism, a love triangle in the making, and enough plot twists to keep the viewer guessing make this compelling drama a must see.

4665651,5,B005ELEMV8,"This six-part six-hour series which aired on the BBC last year has made it to home video in the US. The story is riveting and captures the mood of Britain in 1956, when it takes place. The plot revolves around a team of young TV broadcasters (remember television was barely 10 years old at that time) who are given a weekly news show ( called ""The Hour"") not unlike 60 minutes. When the Suez Canal crisis hits, the staff wants to cover it. But the government (which controls the network) is not so sure they should. And there just might be a ""mole"" inside the organization. I can't tell you more as that would lessen your enjoyment but, after watching the first 20 minutes of episode 1 I was hooked.

There's a ""romantic"" subplot here, which adds some lighter moments, and the production values are superb, recreating the offices and sets of a 1950s television station down to the smallest details. The cast consists of actors well known in the UK but not here - unless you watch BBC America (which I can't get) - and that makes the story more gripping.

Some of the terminology may appear odd to US viewers but remember that - in 1956 - Britain had only a government-run TV network, unlike the commercial ones in the US. I'm old enough to remember the Suez Crisis and 1950s TV and they appear to have gotten every detail correct. If you like the fashion styles of ""Mad Men"", you'll love the outfits in this series.

The Blu-ray has two bonus features: The first is a 10 minute ""behind the scenes"" featurette focusing on the production design. The second is a 20-minute ""creating the show"" featurette with the cast dissecting the characters that they portray.

While the show and DVD certainly get five-stars from me, I should point out that the BD is programmed to always start with the previews included on each disc. This is fine the first time you watch, but it can take 2-3 minutes to start another episode once you've turned off your player and you'll need to use the ""skip"" button at least three times to get to the films Main Menu. More of an annoyance, but I wanted to point this out.

Highly recommended for those interested in: Crime dramas, romantic dramas, political dramas or the history of the television industry.

4665652,5,B005ELEMV8,"THE HOUR, the six-part one-hour mini-series from the BBC that was a recent Golden Globe nominee, is really two shows in one.

On the one hand, it's the story of the launching and day-to-day operation of a revolutionary one-hour topical news show by the BBC and, in this guise, it seems to literally ""borrow"" its three principal character from the 1987 movie, BROADCAST NEWS.  Indeed, the characters played by Romola Garai, Dominic West and Ben Whishaw may have British accents, but they mirror the roles inhabited by Holly Hunter, William Hurt and Albert Brooks in the earlier film.

But, THE HOUR, which was written and created by Abi Morgan, is also an engrossing mystery, involving political intrigue, murder, Russian spies and assassins from MI-6.

Set during the 1950s in the middle of the Cold War and just as the Suez crisis erupts, The Hour begins with Romola being assigned to produce the experimental news program, which will have the handsome, well connected, but not quite ready for prime time West as its anchor.  Also on staff is Romola's platonic best friend, Whishaw, a maverick reporter who had hoped to get West's job.

Problems arise for the trio not only when Government representatives attempt to influence the show's coverage of the Suez events, but also when Whishaw begins an independent inquiry of two murders, one of the victims being an old friend of his who had come to him for help.  His investigation leads him some very high places and some shocking revelations.

The fine cast of this well-written series includes Anna Chancellor, as a veteran reporter of foreign affairs, Oona Chaplin (Charlie's granddaughter), as West's wife, daughter of a prominent family and Anton Lesser, who oversees the news department.

THE HOUR is available on DVD from BBC Video.

4665653,5,B005ELEMV8,I found this DVD an absolutely riviting performance.  I have family in journalism and I sent copies to them and they were also enthused aboutThe Hour.  It has real implications for today's press/media situation as well not just for the time (1956) in which it is set.  I am old enough to remember Hungary and the Suez Canal .  I am thrilled that there will be a second series and look forward to pre-ordering it from Amazon.  This is an important story but also gripping because of the well- drawn characters who tell it.,1324857600,2,521,4.5
4665654,5,B005ELEMV8,"""The Hour"" certainly represents the best in British Television. A first-rate thriller that combines politics and espionage, ""The Hour"" kept me on the edge of my seat for every episode (which, happily, last longer than sixty minutes). Furthermore, the series is outstanding not only in its acting, costumes, and settings, but also in its writing. The characters are surprisingly well-developed, far more than I've come to expect in this genre of television drama, in which characters tend to be stereotypical, if not conventional.

The acting, is, as one might expect from a BBC series, superb, not only the leading players, but also the minor characters, including Tim Piggot-Smith and Juliet Stevenson, as the secretive Lord and Lady Elms; Anna Chancellor, as an almost burnt-out foreign correspondent; Oona Chaplin, as the faithful wife of the philandering news anchor; and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as a slippery special aid to Prime Minister Anthony Eden. I was particularly moved, however, by the performance of Anton Lesser, as Clarence, the chief producer, whose very career hangs on the success or failure of ""The Hour,"" a ground-breaking live BBC television news show, which cannot fail to rattle cages, both at the proper BBC and at the improper (as it happens) Westminster, the seat of the British Government.

One of the factors that makes the series so convincing is the attention to detail as far as the costumes and the settings are concerned. In fact, watching the series took me right back to the 'fifties, jogging my memories about wearing pencil-line calf-length wool skirts and cashmere twinsets by day, and ankle-length ballerina skirts by night. The scenario of the Suez Crisis and the Russians in Hungary similarly conjured up crystal-clear images, some delightful, others thrilling, not to say terrifying: I was in Holland, my first baby was born in April; I was listening to the BBC: Grace Kelly was marrying Prince Ranier of Monaco; the British and Russians were testing nuclear weapons; and Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan were clowning on ""The Goon Show,"" which I found funny, but my Belgian husband found inexplicable. In Fall we went to Brussels, where, for three days, throngs of students kept pouring into the streets shouting in unison, ""Hongrie! Libert&eacute;!"" (Hungary! Freedom!), even as the Soviet tanks were closing in on Budapest; and in Winter it was so cold that all the canals in Amsterdam froze solid, and no coal was to be had due to aftereffects of the Suez Canal crisis. Although I didn't realise it at the time, 1956 was an amazing year, and ""The Hour"" replicates its social and political tensions with what seems to my memory to be striking accuracy.

Since the British Broadcasting Corporation played such an important part in my life in 1956, I was especially interested in a drama set at the heart of the BBC, and the making of a live television news program; for me, the espionage and politics were icing on the cake!

I do not think, however, that one has to be of vintage years to enjoy this political thriller, which is so well written and beautifully acted that its riveting plot and absorbing drama will leave you hoping for a second season; and, if such hopes are not realised, ""The Hour"", with its complex twists and turns and attention to detail, is so enthralling that you might want to enjoy it a second time. And, perhaps, even a third.

8468448,4,B005ELEMV8,"The first season is very good to excellent: superb acting, complex relationships among characters, excellent use of historical background for the story. The mystery/espionage aspect of the plot is well imagined but sloppily realized: it is in the end wobbly and full of holes. The main focus however is on complex characters and their difficult relationships, so plot holes could be forgiven. Everything else is so well done that the season as a whole deserves very high marks. The second season is equally superbly acted, but you can see that the actors are trying to infuse life into characters that have become almost one-dimensional. The plot here is not merely problematic at key points, but it is overall structured as a political and romantic soap opera. Characters in it deteriorate to more or less cardboard plot movers. The first season gave us time to be with the characters and to learn about their past, parents, aspects of their lives not directly connected to the plot. We also had a chance to see Bel and Freddie in playful close friendship. There is none of that in the second season, yet the second season is much more preoccupied with various love stories. Sweet comings together at the end of the second season feel predictable and boringly conventional. I understand why BBC did not invest in the third season. Still, if it ever were to be made, I'd watch it - for the simply brilliant Ben Whishaw and for all other terrific actors (except for Bill Kendall, who seems too bored to act).",1509494400,,1507,4.8

8468450,4,B005ELEMV8,"If you liked ""State of Play"" and ""The Politician's Wife,"" you'll like this too.  Excellent actors, a complicated plot, the state of Britain, if not the world, at risk, and a bunch of dedicated BBC journalists determined to put on a news show (""The Hour"" of the title) that is more than mindless entertainment and that isn't about to let the government (which funds the BBC, remember) dictate what amount or degree of ""truth"" should be dispensed to the British public.  Without giving too much away, I'll just say that there is a ""private"" story that particularly engages one reporter, Freddie Lyon (Ben Whishaw) -- the murder of a girl he knew -- while most of the other reporters , and the show's producer, Bel Rowley (Romola Garai), are fixated with Britain's drift to war with Egypt over the takeover of the Suez Canal in 1956.  For yes -- it is a period drama, and it doesn't insult our intelligence by over-explaining who Eden, Gaitskell, Bevan, and Eisenhower are.  As the crisis builds, the Eden Conservative government tries to control the flow and focus of coverage, while Freddie begins to think that there might be connections between the two stories.  Adding to the interest is Hector Madden (Dominic West), a pretty face who has to be taught to be a credible presenter by Freddie, whom he despises and by whom he is despised, until a degree of mutual respect is reached.  It's a Cold War story too, this being 1956, and the fear of spies and moles thickens the atmosphere surrounding the BBC, and, of course, class differences are still potent in post-WW2 Britain.  All very enjoyable then, with excellent work by the principals, and good work too by Anton Lesser, Tim Pigott-Smith, and Anna Chancellor, who deserve principal status too.  More like a cameo is Juliet Stevenson's turn as Lady Elms and, chillingly effective, Oona Chaplin as Hector's wife.  You won't be disappointed.",1475193600,,1895,4.824074074074074
