7919107,1,B00003L9AR,"""In the Dead of Space"" (also known as ""Space Fury"") is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Starring Michael Par as Konrad, an insane astrophysicist astronaut terrorist (really), this film has a tortuously convoluted plot that makes essentially zero sense, absolutely terrible special effects, including famously bad CGI (a favorite effect of mine is the false color helicopter shot near the end that serves no purpose), and some of the most wretched overacting in screen history, most notably from Par himself.

In the opening Par and Max (Tony Curtis Blondell), who is a beverage star (I don't get it either), start the film off with a bang by crashing their hokey CGI Russian space shuttle into the space station where Russian Yuri (Nenad Petrovic) and French hottie Rene (Lisa Bingley) are already in residence. Now follow this next part very carefully: a Russian prostitute gets murdered in Moscow, the Russian army defeats Russian separatists, there are long minutes of gunfire, grenades, and exploding cars, the crew of the space station eats jellied eel for dinner, and as a result of all this we learn that terrorists have got a suicide agent inside the space station who intends to deorbit the station and crash it into Los Angeles. Of course.

It becomes obvious that Par is the problem child as he has violent mood swings and lack of self-control so common in astronauts. (Ponder.) Par kills Yuri by cutting his oxygen hose during a spacewalk with a sharpened can of Orbit Cola in an attempt to make it look like beverage star Max did it. (I guess.) Rene comes undone over Yuri's loss, while Par and Max engage in pugilistic activities, resulting in Rene (who is now in charge), sending them both to their rooms. (I am not kidding.) Par, it turns out, is allied with the Russian separatists, and after calibrating his nanolasers, he practices hand to hand combat moves with a knife in his room. From that point on fights break out randomly, ultimately putting Max into a coma of some sort.

Apparently in the future only complete lunatics are allowed to go into space; the mental instability Par demonstrates along with yet another subplot, this time about blackmail, only serves to further muddy the water. As bad as the plot is, the acting is worse, and the accents are way, way worse; this reaches a crescendo when Par has a monologue on the nature of science, terrorism, blackmail, and a bunch of other things I probably napped through, leading to charges of murder being issued against him via radio by an unlikable Russian police officer. Par loves being in control (""It's my space station!"", etc.) and duels with commander Rene, first with the station's robotic arm (why did she go outside the station on an EVA in the first place?), then with a knife and some karate.

I won't reveal the stirring conclusion, but suffice it to say that it involves Par literally chewing through his restraints, a flaming space shuttle, a preposterous crash landing, and the hammiest alternating crying and laughing closeups in the last twenty years.

I know that Par is bigger in Europe and Japan than in the US, but I kept wondering how he ever got an acting gig anywhere on the planet after the release of ""In the Dead of Space"". I love camp movies and B-movies of all varieties, but this piece of Canadian cheese smells of Limburger sitting in the hot Arizona sun in August. As a B-movie aficionado, I am a big fan of Roger Corman, but even his role as an executive producer on this project cannot justify the pain the movie will bring into your life. Interestingly the only redeeming thing about this DVD is a small but interesting booklet inside the case on Roger Corman and New Horizons Home Video.

Be good to yourself: watch a different movie. You'll be glad you did.",1268006400,2,3783,4.732928679817906

Your either a fan of this type of movie or your not.

I loved it",1187222400,2,128,4.08
7919109,4,B00003L9AR,"In the Dead of Space is a camp classic!  The mediocre acting and low-budget props are part of the charm.  It is at least as good as some early episodes of ""Doctor Who"" or ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".  The beautiful face and incredibly perfect hair of Lisa Bingley (Rene) makes you want to see more of her, and she does not disappoint.  She disrobes, not once, but twice in the movie. The scene where she takes off her bra and gives us a few seconds of upper frontal you-know-what makes the whole thing worthwhile.  Considering the price, you cannot afford to not buy this one!",1178409600,3,574,4.377358490566038
7919110,1,B00003L9AR,"Oooh....IN THE DEAD OF SPACE is a scifi bomb paired with a madman killer, all in the confines of the Tesla space station.  We even get George Chuvalo, the former heavyweight boxer, in the role of a cigarette chomping Russian terrorist leader.  (For all of three minutes).  We even get B movie hunk Michael Pare playing the villain and acting like he's lost his mind.  I think Pare the actor has to have even considered participating in this massive clunker.

The special effects look like they were created on a child's computer by a child; the script is incoherent and dull; all of the acting is bad; the sound editing is atrocious; people's lips move and they're not in sync with the dialogue, and the addition of the African American celebrity whatever adds nothing to the already horrendous plot.

A real stinkeroo..don't waste your valuable time like I did.",1093219200,6,862,4.751677852348993
7919111,1,B00003L9AR,"Answer: This film is so bad that free copies were given to Pocatello high school students at the senior party, along with other useless crap such as keychains, plastic windshield scrapers, and t-shirts with the local bank insignia.
This film doesn't rate even 1 star; minus 20 stars is more like it.",1074038400,7,299,4.769230769230769
7919112,3,B00003L9AR,"I normally write good stuff when I've picked up a film by Roger Corman working with Daniel Dor & G. Phillip Jackson and it's sometimes hard to know who's responsible for things turning out how they do. In many ways this film -clearly a low budget effort, is just fine. Particularly so given that it all happens in outer space. It's solid sci-fi fare with good FX, excelent suspense, and a story that will become relavant as they keep building that International Space Station.
The idea is that an astronaut on board a fictional Russian built space station is being held ransom by a succesionist state in Russia (it's implied they're Chechnians, but they never say). So suddenly we have a killer on board the space ship, his job is to sabotage the station and drop the flaming wreck somewhere into America- America will blame the Russians, the Russians don't want that so they will do anything they can to negotiate with the guy and save the station.
Problem is, our on-board terrorist stopped caring a long time ago, he just wants his spectaculare firey crash, and he no longer cares about politics. So it's up to one person aboard the station to stop our madman. I won't say more so as to not give it all away, but the suspense gets sufficiently intense at some points and we don't know who the bad guy is for for some time.
In many ways the script, credited to Vincent Monton is a rip-off of the much more succesful Corman/Dor/Jackson picture ""Falling Fire"". Director Eli Necekov has a nice visual style, but the secondary cast is out of his control. Michael Pare and all the cast in the space station do well enough. If you like sci-fi on the low-budget end, I'm OK recommending it.",976579200,14,1685,4.564356435643564
7919113,1,B00003L9AR,"I can only comment on the first 45 minutes of this movie - I couldn't stand to watch any more than that! I tried to watch a rented version of this film, and boy am I glad I didn't buy it.  Between the horrible acting  (fake accents which come and go, robotic delivery of dialog and clumsy  fistfights), a jumbled plot, awful editing and 1970's quality special  effects, this movie has no redeeming qualities.",952041600,10,408,4.472972972972973
