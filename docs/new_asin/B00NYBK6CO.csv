8681064,5,B00NYBK6CO,"Got this DVD at a book signing for Keith White Jr. recently and my kids love it.

The DVD itself features 9 of the 1940s Superman cartoons and the case insert can be removed so that the kids can color it and write their name on it. They can also write their name on the DVD top with a marker but I didn't let them do that part.

It's a novel idea and a fun way for the kids to spend the afternoon actually using thier brains while try watch TV instead of just begging out.

I hope there are more volumes soon.",1411862400,,509,3.9223300970873787
