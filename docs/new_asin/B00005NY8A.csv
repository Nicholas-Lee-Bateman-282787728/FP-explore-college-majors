8219312,3,B00005NY8A,"It you are interested in this item, be aware that it is not a movie DVD. I bought it expecting to see a concert performance of the music. Instead, all you get on the screen whilst the music plays is a static caption telling you what you are listening to. The sound quality is excellent. The performance is OK but not as good as some others you can buy on CD.",1144540800,7,358,4.056338028169014
