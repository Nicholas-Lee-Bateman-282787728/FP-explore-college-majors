2496261,5,B000E5RKOA,"My generation (born 1978) has grown up with jokes about Shtirlitz as being this wacky Tihonov character always in the situations with the Nazis. I got this on the DVD's and watched it from beginning to an end...so far only once. But, in truth I think it is a really good movie to watch with your friends (Russian or not) - you can have a few good laughs, especially if you are Russian, if not you can explain to them that this is a landmark of Soviet suspense thriller....at least the way it was viewed by the central gov-t. Ye, okay..",1245888000,7,535,4.306930693069307
2496262,5,B000E5RKOA,"This really is a great 13 hour film set in Germany at the end of WWII where a russian spy is embedded at Nazi headquarters in the intelligence division.  Even though Seventeen Moments of Spring came before the British tv spy show The Sandbaggers, there are a lot of similarities.  Especially in that they concentrate on the realistic side of spying, not the James Bond etc side.  The film can also really pass itself off as a true to life documentary of what the end of WWII was like in Germany. And is useful as a history lesson as well. Definately recommended as engaging entertainment or as a filmed documentary.",1235433600,9,615,4.572727272727272
2496263,5,B000E5RKOA,"Well, what can I say other than I agree with these 2 guys 100%?
Specially when it comes to acting and the deeper meaning of it in this movie. The society aroung Stirlitz, the totalitarian government, its arbitrary rules, the need to live a 'double life' can apply to just about any totalitarian regime in the world, including the former Soviet Union itself, where this movie was made, and moreover for me, to the Communist Cuba in which I grew up. So much so, that at the time this series was released in Cuba me and my friends at Havana University used to wonder how in the world would our government would allow such a film in TV.
Let's face it: Stirlitz is by no means the ""James Bond"" of the Soviet Block, as some people have the tendency to compare him: There are no good looking ladies sleeping with him. There are no fancy bars, mansions with a 'mad man' ready to destroy the world. There are nevertheless, all the intrigues, surveillace, repressions and dogma of a government that watch just about every move of everyone. There is the passion of this guy to save his motherland from evil enemies, but there is also -very deep and fine detailed- his questioning about his role, his mission and his own passion.
If you like James Bond, you'll hate this series.
If you like real acting, real drama -and, most of all- a hidden message about totalitarian societies, you'll love this.",1203120000,24,1386,4.548
2496264,5,B000E5RKOA,"A absolutely agree with Oleg Semenikhin.
There are a lot of movies from my childhood that I thought where great at the time, now seem very silly and not interesting, and I was a bit afraid to buy ""Seventeen Moments of Spring"" because I was afraid to be disillusioned.
This movie is one of the best I have seen in a while. I bought the set and I know that I will enjoy it every time I watch it.
The simplicity of cinematography with out blown up cars and chases, or computer graphics or even special effects, yet it's so full of emotions and action.
When they played this movie on USSR TV the city that I grew up in went dead, everyone was at home watching.
It is Soviet Neo-realism!!
I wish in US they showed movies like this.",1162944000,28,726,4.192857142857143
2496265,5,B000E5RKOA,"Many movies that used to impress us awhile ago fail to impress us any more. Not this one. This movie is a masterpiece of the Soviet cinema. I have seen this movie several times on the Russian/Soviet TV long ago. Now when it is available on DVD in North America, I have watched it again and I cannot think of any other old Russian/Soviet movie that strikes me so much, except maybe The Cranes are Flying.

On the surface, the story is about an agent of the Soviet intelligence service who tries to obtain the proof of the attempts of high-rank Nazi to strike a separate deal with the Western Allies in the last months of the World War Two in Europe. However, the movie is much deeper than a spy thriller. No invisible ink, hi-tech guns and beautiful women. Or, rather, just one: the hero's wife. He had not seen her for many years, and now he is allowed to meet her. He is in a cafe in Berlin. She enters, takes a seat in a far corner, orders a cup of coffee. She talks to her companion for a minute and then, suddenly, she turns over to face her husband. They look into each other's eyes for a second or two, then she turns her gaze away from him, put her coffee aside and walk away. The meeting is over. Oh, the power of these so mercilessly brief moments... No words, just great acting and beautiful music. This scene is one of the greatest masterpieces of all times.

Another deep and quite striking line of the story (especially for a Soviet movie) is the power of beliefs as symbolized by old pastor Schlag and, more generally, the tough choices people have to face under totalitarian regimes, how they make people heroes or villains and how often people have to pay with their lives just to stay human. Simply put, this movie is a masterpice. There are a few very deep and very powerful movies out there that can be considered masterpieces; this one, being beautifully made and containing some brilliant acting, is also very simple and highly watchable. Again, I cannot but remember The Cranes Are Flying: a simple story brilliantly told that became a true masterpiece. The Seventeen Moments of Spring are of the same highest calibre.",1139616000,44,2140,4.484615384615385
8106236,5,B000E5RKOA,"Outstanding, excellent use of historical footage and reasonably accurate.  Great acting, and staging.  Given its age... did not seem dated.",1496966400,2,139,5.9
8106237,1,B000E5RKOA,I found this film to be suicidal boring! Scenes that are 6 minutes of eating and hardly any exchange of information ... why? How is that entertaining? It's like watching paint dry. I made it through 3/4 of epi one and thought I can't do 13 hours of this. BTW I just watched 32 hours of Tenko (1981) so I can play the long game and do the oldies. GONG!,1495670400,,351,4.0285714285714285
8106238,5,B000E5RKOA,"It is not similar to any American movies or television series. The show is cross between  ""Infernal Affairs""  and ""Rashomon"". ""The Moments"" is superb piece of cinematography but not for people with a short attention span.",1471392000,,221,5.111111111111111
8106239,1,B000E5RKOA,"I wanted to like this movie.  After all, it is one of V. Putins favorites---and we KNOW that Mr. Putin is ALWAYS RIGHT....RIGHT?

 But, I HATED IT.  I ONLY WATCHED THE FIRST AND 2ND OF SIX CD'S.  TO ME IT WAS VERY BORING...I HAVE TO SAY.  SLOW MOVING......YES...BORING!  DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!",1447718400,,299,4.425925925925926
8106240,3,B000E5RKOA,"I finally watched it ""from cover to cover.""  This is a strange movie with great artists. I think for most people it will be boring. However, those who feel nostalgia for the Soviet past, it will be a great gift.",1440633600,2,211,4.275
8106241,5,B000E5RKOA,"This is without a question, THE BEST WW2 movie out there. Not only that its a Master Piece of a Russian Cinima but you can't compare the acting of the cast and the script to any of the movies out there.  I've seen this movie (without joking) over 100 times and it's just doesn't get old.  Everytime I watch it, it's like a first time all over again. It's just gets you into your seat and won't let go. I strongly recomed to buy, rent or do whatever it takes to watch this movie!! Trust me!! You won't regret it !! Sit down, turn it on and enjoy the best of the best!! Very good piece of the history!! Great for ALL of the generations out there. Seventeen Moments of Spring /...
Vyacheslav Tikhonov is the HERO of a war and the history of a Russian Cinima. ITS TOO BAD ITS NOT AVAILIBLE ON BLURAY!! MUST SEE!!! If you buy from
From Amazon, it's AVAILIBLE with English Subtitles.",1430784000,2,877,4.214285714285714
8106242,5,B000E5RKOA,"First of all, I agree with much of the things positive the previous reviewers have said about this film.  As to James Bond, love his films though I do they are basically cartoons with little of reality except some of their settings - and their characters are contrived caricatures (but great fun!).

""Seventeen Moments of Spring"" stands apart from all of that. It does share the stage with another great Russian spy thriller series that starts with ""Oshibka Residyenta', The Secret Agent's Blunder, (find it at Amazon) with its straight-up portrayal of Cold War espionage. But that, too, is a story made up for the screen.

In ""Seventeen Moments of Spring"", with the exception of the surely non-existent hero, Stirlitz, a great  deal of the plot, even the characters personalities, come from the memoirs of Walter Schellenberg, the Nazi head of foreign espionage. Readily available in English from Amazon, here are real espionage high-jinks - e.g. the plot to capture The Prince of Wales, the negotiations with Alan Dulles, etc. The actual photographs in the book of the Nazi hierarchy show how closely they are copied in the actors used in the film. Despite hints of a Soviet mole in the Nazi high command, no convincing evidence has ever been made public. The actions and story around Stirlitz are surely made up, but many of  their contexts are pretty accurate -and the events are within the realm of actuality; many missteps, no unreal actions or situations - these things really happened to people, perhaps in different forms.

These 6 discs are a fascinating way to submerge one's self in the throes of Nazi Germany and the 'Good Guy' role of the Soviets (from the Moscow point of view) in the last days of World War II. No wonder the KGB honored the memory of the actor, Tikhonov, who played Stirlitz.

Read the book! Watch the film!  Highly recommended !!

8106244,5,B000E5RKOA,This is an old series (1970's) from the Soviet Union times about a spy in the Nazi command. True story and well acted. Loved the black and white as well. The music is good also.,1389744000,3,177,4.085714285714285
8106245,4,B000E5RKOA,"A great tele-series made in The Soviet Union (Russia) the 60's or 70's where it enjoyed immense popularity and where people set their weekly timetables around the need to see the next instalment.
Basically it involves the activities of a deep-cover Russian 'mole' who rose to the highest ranks of the Nazi security service, the SD, with direct access to Heinrich ""Gestapo"" Mueller -------- among other Nazi luminaries, and kept Moscow informed of German plans and movements.
Whether such a 'mole' ever existed is still debated, as is the final whereabouts of Gestapo Mueller himself. Reports that Mueller was recruited by the NKVD (KGB) and spent his 'retirement' working in Moscow abounded in the post war years.
Again a great movie to get an appreciation of how the Soviets regarded the Western Allies war efforts as almost inconsequential. Several references are made in the final episodes to the possibility that the the West was seeking to do a deal with Hitler and his band in order to allow them to keep fighting the Russians while reaching a peace settlement with USA and England.
Sadly many Russians I know believe this to be the truth and regard Churchill and Roosevelt as duplicitous evil doers hell bent on destroying the Soviet Union.",1297468800,5,1247,4.942857142857143
