3532592,5,B001DJ7PSC,Great love story. Falling in love in times of war is always sad. One woman that three men fall in love with and she never knows.  Delightful,1233619200,,140,4.185185185185185
3532593,4,B001DJ7PSC,"I picked up this movie as a rental the other day, mainly because it was directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, but also because it had Shirley Maclaine and Christopher Plummer in it. I was very pleased with the movie - it is a poignant story that deals with the themes of love, loss, redemption and healing.

The story begins with a memorial for WW II vet, Chuck Norris in a small town in the US. His daughter Marie [Neve Campbell] is grief-stricken but her mother, Chuck's widow Ethel [Shirley Maclaine] seems unmoved and casually smokes outside the funeral hall. She is joined by Chuck's good friend Jack [Christopher Plummer] and we are taken back via flashback to the 1940s when Ethel[Mischa Barton] was a young girl in love with Teddy [Stephen Amell] and whose close friends are Jack [Gregory Smith] and Chuck [David Alpay]. All three men are in love with Ethel, but it's Teddy who wins Ethel's heart. When WW II begins, the boys go off to war, but not before a secret marriage between Ethel and Teddy. When Teddy gets killed in action whilst flying over Belfast,Ireland Ethel is grief-stricken and comforted by Jack and Chuck.

Back in the present, Ethel finds herself reminiscing about the past to herself, but is surly and silent with her daughter Marie who is bewildered by her mother's lack of grieving over Chuck's death. It is only when a young Irish lad Jimmy [Martin McCann] finds the gold wedding ring belonging to Teddy on Black Mountain in Belfast and contacts Ethel, that the past starts to unravel and Ethel finds herself having to confront some hard truths, including some surprising revelations.

The story itself flows well and the plot is cohesive. I did find the sub-plot in the present with the IRA conflict in Northern Ireland [and Jimmy's inadvertent involvement in it] a bit distracting, but it did prove important in tying the loose ends together at the end.

The acting by the leads was very convincing, especially by Maclaine and Plummer as the older Ethel and Jack. The actors playing the younger roles back in the 1940s also did a credible job, especially Mischa Barton as the young Ethel. Martin McCann as young Jimmy was quite adorable in his role as the naive Irish lad with a tendency towards plain speaking. There are nude scenes in this movie [Ethel as played by Mischa] and some violence [bombings and shootings by the IRA and also government agents].

All in all, I found ""Closing the Ring"" to be a well-acted romance/family drama and would recommend it to fans of the genre.",1233360000,22,2515,4.732876712328767
3532594,4,B001DJ7PSC,"I watched this film online and, since it appeared to be a low-budget film, I didn't expect very much, but as soon as Shirley MacLaine appeared, the power of the film became much more intense.  Seeing her in this role reminded me of how moving she is on screen.  I didn't realize until the credits came up that the film had been directed by Richard Attenborough.  Shirley MacLaine makes this film worth watching.  Christopher Plummer has an emotional scene that surprised me.  And Martin McCann's performance was exceptional.  I never expected to enjoy it as much as I did.",1231286400,33,572,4.7272727272727275

3532823,5,B001DJ7PSC,"CLOSING THE RING is an interesting film with a fine script and cast of characters.

3532824,4,B001DJ7PSC,You can't really go into it expecting anything. You should keep an open mind when watching this film. There are a lot of historical discrepancies.,1386979200,,146,4.88
3532825,2,B001DJ7PSC,"I suspect the idea behind all of this was reasonably good - in a hallmark hall of fame sort of way.  With a certain set, I'm sure generation-spanning romance is a great draw.  But even not belonging to that particular ""set"", I figured: oh - look it's the dude from Arrow (with his shirt ON which is pretty novel) and the sweet guy from Everwood along with some really heavy-hitters (MacLaine, Plummer, Postlethwaite) - how could it possibly suck?  Oh...let me count the ways. Bad dialogue.  Bad, Bad Dialogue.  It needs a 'time-out' or, possibly, some more intense punishment.  I don't know who wrote this dialogue but I surmise he or she was raised by wild animals and had never, in fact, spoken to another human being.  After that I would like to point a finger at some truly awful acting except...I've seen most of these actor in other projects and none of them are flat-out terrible.  Some of them are quite good, some are merely adequate and some are actually great.  But every actor in this film seems to be reading their lines off of cards over their fellow actors shoulders...while being poked in the shins with needles.  And the end result is as painful for the watcher as it is for the actors.  And don't just take my word for it.  I am not a fan of generic romantic movies.  But my mother, who, if she has a flaw, it is her blind adoration of sappy, unrealistic love stories, turned to me halfway through this movie and asked, ""Do we really have to keep watching this? It makes my wine taste bad?"".",1378598400,,1509,4.463503649635037
3532826,5,B001DJ7PSC,This movie is superb.  It has a great storyline...and the cast is excellent.  This is what classic movies are all about.  If you like a good drama...you will love this movie!  Highly recommended!,1358812800,,195,4.818181818181818
3532827,4,B001DJ7PSC,"Wonderful DVD...just as described by seller.  Fabulous transaction and a worthwhile product.  The storyline to ""Closing the Ring"" is full of surprises and draws you in from the very first 'flashback' .  I certainly recommend this to any hopeless romantic or historical fiction buff.",1345939200,,282,5.363636363636363
3532828,3,B001DJ7PSC,"This was quite a good movie, really a 3.9 star rating, just shy of four stars.  Certainly the storyline kept me involved, desiring to see how the characters might reclaim and reconcile love which had been shattered 50 years earlier in the violence and devastation of WWII.  The intertwining of the young and old generations, the cultures, and the modern-day with modern history gave this story great potential for success.  And anyone who sees the movie must admit the all-star cast and crew bring a level of talent difficult to surpass, thereby increasing the probability this one could have been a great movie.  But I think the movie failed to achieve its potential greatness because at the most fundamental level the writing wasn't great, and a weak screenplay prevented a great story from becoming a great movie.

That being said, it's still a movie worth watching as I think it can - in some way - perhaps bring some understanding to our younger generations as to how personal the losses of WWII were to that generation, including the many lost loves.",1321488000,,1056,4.8121546961325965
3532829,4,B001DJ7PSC,"This is a wonderful love story, powerful and tragic. A young man and a woman fall in love. The man has to go to war. The woman is left behind. The man, Teddy, commits his friend Chuck to take care of Ethel if he won't return. Chuck loves Ethel. She does not love him. There is a third man, Jack, who also loves Ethel but is too proud to tell or to admit. Teddy does not return. At the tender age of 21, Ethel feels her life is over. Ten years later, she finally marries Chuck. Jack marries another girl, and another, and a third. He keeps an eye on Ethel.
The film starts when Chuck died. Ethel does not mourn. Chuck was a good man, but she never loved him. At the same time, a young man who is fascinated by airplanes and loves the word ""fantastic"" finds in Belfast a ring that belonged to Teddy. He searches for Ethel, and finds her. He wants to close the ring. Ethel needs to close the ring. So does Jack. Both need redemption. Both need to confront their deep, hidden feelings. Both need to overcome the huge shadow of Teddy.
This is a moving film, with great actors (Shirley MacLaine, Christopher Plummer and Martin McCann), great story, sensitive director (Richard Attenborough) and a great song (""Lost without You"" by Amy Pearson). One of the rare movies I watched more than once, and enjoyed both times equally.",1318032000,,1319,4.387755102040816

3532831,5,B001DJ7PSC,"If it there were 10 stars it would not be enough to rate this movie.
....First it is not a sweet love story.  It is a story of people making promises to people they love or admire. Then there is the final promise I won't mention.  You find every single prominent character either gives a promise or agrees to a promise and this story is the result of those promises.
.... It covers a period of time from WWII in both the midwest US and Ireland.  You may be surprised by the Irish portion.  Watch carefully.
....Then there are the switches between the 1940s and the 1990s.  It goes back and forth, it gives you a scene in 1940, then switches to the present where the result of what happened in the 1940s is shown to you in present time of the movie.  Or you see an action in the present time and next thing you know you are watching what caused this scene.
....I loved this time switching to introduce you to a problem or a solution the characters came up with to deal with the promises made and often resulted in.... well you have to watch the film for this part.  I know better than to spoil it.  Lets just say it enhances the story telling.
....Please be able to really watch the movie, notice the promises and then see the results of keeping and in some cases not keeping the promises.  I promise you won't regret it.

3532832,4,B001DJ7PSC,"This was an wonderful film. It brought together two cultures and two periods in history in beautiful ways. The story was very sad and I felt it told more than just an isolated story. In many ways this was the story of the generation robbed of their youth, hopes and dreams by the terrible reality of WWII. However, the film was also incredibly funny. The Irish added tremendous comical detail, if you got it that is. Richard Attenborough created a lovely piece.",1304899200,,461,4.634146341463414
3532863,5,B001DJ7PSC,I really enjoyed this movie. Shirley MacLaine does an exellent job acting her parts. Many of her newer movies are better than the ones near the start of her career. And this is one of those movies. I will enjoy watching this movie again.,1291852800,2,237,4.409090909090909
3532864,3,B001DJ7PSC,"This is a well put together movie but I can't rate it over a 3 because it's too sad to be overly enjoyable to me.

Life's hard enough without falling in love is almost a quote from the movie.  Of coarse if not for a war things wouldn't likely turn out that way so you might say war sucks is the obvious message you'll get out of it.

To be honest, I've been watching a lot of the OC on soapnet recently & bought this used for the topless scenes of Mischa Barton.  If that's what you're looking for you will get a nice direct but short butt & 2 breast (one frontal & one side) shots.

I did enjoy the movie despite the sad events but I'd suggest a rental not a purchase.  I can't see much appeal in watching it more than once.  Used you can buy it for little more than a rental price if you think you will want to own it ... say if you're a Mischa Barton fan & want to check her out now & then but I'd rather just watch the OC myself.",1290988800,,933,3.8534031413612566
3532865,4,B001DJ7PSC,"This story was written around a real event that happened--the finding of a ring. I got this movie, because Mischa Barton was in it, and in my opinion, she is one of the most beautiful women in the world. She is also a good actor. However, I was blown away by this movie, because it is so much more than I expected. It covers two periods--the 1940s and currently, and in two different countries--the United States and Ireland.

A young woman (Mischa Barton) sends her newly married husband off to World War II, never to see him again. Shirley MacLaine plays the young woman grown old with time. The story is told through flashbacks to her earlier life, and cutaways to present day Ireland.

Christopher Plummer is excellent as the older version of the boy who wanted to marry her himself, but she was in love with his friend. He came back from the war, and has stood by her the ensuing decades even though she ultimately married another man.

This is a story about love. The losing of it, and coming to terms with that loss late in life. This is a surprising good movie no one every heard of.",1268006400,3,1091,4.417910447761194

3532870,4,B001DJ7PSC,"After viewing this British/Canadian production on DVD, the question arises why can't films like this suffer from poor distribution here in the States?  Surely, the reputations of Lord Attenborough (Gandhi, Jurassic Park, Young Winston), Shirley McLaine and Christopher Plummer would've been enough to insure distribution here in the US.  But unfortunately what we get here is basically crap like the latest horror film or franchise--and so much of it is negative.  The cast and its director should be commended on delivering a poignant love story for adults--there hasn't been much on the screen these days since the success of ""The Notebook""---and I think this film is even better than that box office success.  Plummer himself is very moving in the final moments of this fine film and McLaine also delivers as a stoic, repressed widower with some secrets of her own.  The young actors that portray them are also excellent with special mention of Mischa Barton who if a lucky producer sees her in this film should have a career like Rachel McAdams (The Notebook).  Heartily recommended for romantics and lovers of adult dramas too!!",1243728000,,1133,5.097297297297297

An interesting finish, which I admit I really didn't see coming, and a film I'd have no problem recommending to friends in the mood for something intelligently pleasant.",1501632000,,349,4.915254237288136

Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

I don't usually like movies or books that go back and forth constantly between the past and the present. Im usually frustrated, lamenting over the lost art of a linear storyline. Im glad I stuck it out and watched Closing the Ring; it was very entertaining.

The film starts at Shirley MacLaines husbands funeral. Christopher Plummer sits outside with her during the service. Then, a flash to the past, with a young Shirley MacLaine surrounded by three adoring servicemen about to be shipped off to WW2. Which one is young Christopher Plummer? Which one is her husband?

As the film continues, more mysteries are introduced. Neve Campbell cant understand her mothers attitude after her fathers death. And in Ireland, Pete Postlethwaite is digging in a dangerous area, finding pieces of a wrecked WW2 airplane. Each flashback to the 1940s gives just one more piece to the ever-growing puzzle, and it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. I kept pressing pause when I rented this movie with my mom to talk about what I thought would be revealed. Sometimes I was right, sometimes I was wrong, and that made the plot even more entertaining.

Probably because one of the first movies I remember seeing Christopher Plummer in was The Lakehouse, I never found him to be a very likable guy. He was so convincingly cold, I had a hard time seeing him as anything else. However, in Closing the Ring, Christopher Plummer gives a very different performance. Im going to have to rethink my impression of him. In one scene, he burst into tears so naturally, I wanted to reach through the screen and embrace him in a tight hug.

While the younger actors in the movie aren't going to be nominated for Oscars anytime soon, the older folks make up for it. Shirley MacLaine looks beautiful, so if you're one of her fans, don't miss this one! And if you like WW2 movies, or movies that flash back and forth with a little mystery, youll love it.",1498694400,,1993,4.666666666666667
