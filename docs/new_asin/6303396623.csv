646072,4,6303396623,"Anyone would have to agree that the best FILM ever made about the Titanic is ""A Night to Remember"" because it tells the blow by blow true story, from sailing to sinking, based on Walter Lord's excellent book of the same name. But if you're looking for a MOVIE, that is, something which is like an historical novel version of the tragedy, then I'd steer you to this one starring Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck.
Stanwyck has boarded the ship with her son and daughter while running away from her husband Webb. She has lost most of her respect for her sartorially resplendent husband and believes that he is making a snob out of the teenaged daughter. Webb has outwitted her, however, and bought an immigrant's ticket in order to make the passage. He and Stanwyck do an excellent job of portraying a bad marriage gone even worse when, trying to inflict more pain on her husband, Stanwyck makes a startling disclosure that hits Webb just about as hard as the iceberg will the ship.
Lots of other interesting passengers aboard too: The daughter is being courted by college man Robert Wagner, while Richard Basehart is a defrocked priest who finally gets his act together when the presence of a clergyman is needed most. And as real-life passengers, Thelma Ritter as Molly Brown and Brian Aherne as Captain Smith both do a great job.
Best scenes? The aforementioned bombshell Stanwyck delivers to Webb; Captain Smith realizing that the ship is listing to one side as he listens to some college kids singing their alma mater; and finally, Webb's tear-filled eyes as he bids farewell to Stanwyck just before she gets into a lifeboat. This is a ""Titanic"" with characters who care about each other, and whom we can consequently care about ourselves.
If you're looking for something sudsier than the factual ""A Night to Remember"", then your ship has come in with this great tearjerker.",999388800,22,1877,4.7784615384615385
646073,5,6303396623,"One of my all-time 10 favorite movies (along with ALL ABOUT EVE, GONE WITH THE WIND, AUNTIE MAME, Jane Wyman's THE BLUE VEIL, Garland's A STAR IS BORN, CABARET, Lana Turner's career highlight in MADAME X, 1939's THE WOMEN, and 1953's SO BIG) THIS is the only version of TITANIC anyone should want to keep in their collection of classics. This is the one that should have been an Academy Award champion.....and it is a sin that Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck not only didn't win 1953 Oscars, but were not even nominated. Ditto the wonderful performance of the greatest supporting actress in movie history, Thelma Ritter, as the indomitable Unsinkable Molly Brown. I will never forget the hysteria in Barbara Stanwyck's voice as she screamed ""Norman! Norman!"" when she realized her young son had slipped out of their life-boat to remain with his dad as the ship sank.....nor the tears in Clifton Webb's eyes when he told the boy what pride he felt for him as the end drew near. Please, don't anyone tell me there was an ounce of reality in the blockbuster, phony '97 version.....This simple black & white  movie told the REAL story of the very rich and the very poor suddenly equalized in the face of disaster. And I dare you not to smile as millionaire John Jacob Astor reassures his young, pregnant, second wife with the immortal words ""My dear, God himself could not sink THIS ship""......and I defy you not to cry when old Mrs. Strauss refuses to board a life-boat, saying ""I've been with Mr. Strauss for more than fifty years....I don't intend to leave him now."" This is a classic. This is THE classic. And these people, brilliantly portrayed by brilliant actors, become the ones who were really aboard the TITANIC in 1912.",984441600,105,1728,4.7218543046357615
646074,3,6303396623,"I felt the ship was more of a secondary story than the Sturgis family and their problems.  While it is nice to see the view of the 1953 director, more homework should have been done on the historical events. For example  the ship correctly turns hard-a-starboard to try avoiding hitting the burg, but the film shows the iceburg hitting the ship on the port side. Before the final plunge, Capt. Smith looking up at the British flag flying on the masthead.  Problem here is sun is shining on the flag during the shot, impossible at 2:15am.  Also, there was no alarm on the ship as is depicted in the film.

BTW, I agree with another reviewer that Brian Aherne  was not a good Capt. Smith, too sophisticated, not salty enough!

The  opening scene with Titanic at Cherbourg is shot in the fog with Capt. Smith  talking to whom I assume is the fictional character of Bruce Ismay.  Ismay  sailed on the voyage, the character left the ship.  Also the Titanic  arrived at Cherbourg dusk and did not sail in afternoon fog.

Lastly, I don't think  the passengers gathered around the bridge singing for the final plundge.  Definately a Hollywood touch!  Besides the forward funnel had already  collasped on top on the bridge making this scene all but  impossible.

However, I still think it's a nice little movie if you don't  mind the historical miscues. Worthwhile for your Titanic collection.",965779200,,1384,4.707112970711297
646075,4,6303396623,"The original Hollywood feature with Barbara Stanwyck. Just like James Cameron's 1997 version, the story is told around a love story. Considering the period when this movie was made, the effects are just as stunning - and  there was no computer animation either.  Filmed in Black & White.  The  best movie about the Titanic is ""Titanic - A Night To Rememeber""  (currently only available on DVD - see our review).",959299200,,411,4.814285714285714
646076,5,6303396623,"Any film with Clifton Webb, Barbara Stanwyck, and the indomitable Thelma Ritter is worth a ""look see.""  Sure, James Cameron had 200 million bucks and state-of-the-art special effects (along with the  camera-friendly Leo and Kate).  But, this 1953 film has class in its  performances from the principals.  Much shorter than the 1997 epic and  filmed in black and white, the film holds its own as a good movie.  In  fact, the B & W adds stark realism to the tragedy.  Watch carefully for  the stunning announcement Stanwyck makes to husband Webb in their cabin  prior to the fateful collision.  This was somewhat shocking for the time!  I know when I saw this scene upon first viewing, my mouth dropped open!",950313600,12,706,4.783333333333333
646077,4,6303396623,"I don't remember when I saw this the first time,But I much prefer it to its highly hyped  1997 successor.  I rented the video the other night and still sniffled at the end. I would imagine most viewers don't know that it  won an Oscar.(For best screenplay,I think.) My mother was just thrilled  with the very young Robert Wagner.  Does anyone know what happened to  Audrey Dalton???  One of the best ""minor"" characters had to be  Richard Basehart as the defrocked priest. and wasn't that Edmund  Purdom(uncredited) as ""Mr Lightoller?  Barabara Stanwyck and  Clifton Webb were excellent too.  Characters much more clearly drawn than  in the 1997 version. Class distinction is not as hokey as Jack and Rose.  Was Thelma Ritter supposed to be ""Molly Brown""?  I think the  effect of the film in black and white works very well(NO COLORIZATION  PLEASE!)",932774400,6,848,4.859154929577465
646078,4,6303396623,"Overshadowed by the 1998 blockbuster, I feel that this version, although dated, offers the viewer more character development, or perhaps , empathy. I enjoyed the performances of Webb and the mighty Stanwyck. Maybe I am out  of touch with the ""in vogue"" young actors, but I really liked the  ""family"" aspect of this film and don't need the special effects  and flashback gimmickry of the new version to keep my attention. Being 46  and father of two young boys, my heartstrings are still tugged each year  when we watch this film together. Give it a try.",923788800,10,553,4.71875

646148,5,6303396623,"I first saw this movie as a young child. Then later some place in my teens. Though the years have passed by and yes other Titanic movies have been released, this simple sweet yet endearing story of courage and peace to face the unknown is still a strong story. Story of a small part of families at a crossroads; some to begin a new life in another country. Some to begin a new life as eyes open to the simple beauty God has given them. And in doing so put to rest the demons that have come to hound them with such earnest. That Welsh song ""Nearer My God To Thee"" is still of some debate by many that song of faith and acceptance was song that cold night in 1912. It may have, also the prayers of many lost in the screams of the frighten still could be felt and so that beautiful song to our Lord was heard by all. Yes this story was made at time when a film was told by all the players. Simple special effects, no crudeness, just simple people going about their daily lives. That to me is simple power and message conveyed of those who survived and to the 1500 souls lost. How you face life is how you will face death when death comes calling.",1497225600,,1143,4.107142857142857

646202,5,6303396623,"My all time favorite Titanic film will always be ""A Night To Remember"" but this is a very fine drama which focuses on and depicts the relationship of a mother and her two children who are returning to America after living, for many years, in the moneyed privilege of European culture and tradition.  Barbara Stanwyck is Julia Sturges, who has decided to leave her husband behind so she can bring her children to America where they will learn, and where she can teach them, what a ""normal"" upbringing is and have them discover what self reliant living is all about.  She wants them to experience life rather than have them remain in an existence that will teach them little of real value.  Richard Ward Sturges, Clifton Webb, discovers her plans at the last second and manages to get on board the Titanic with the help of another passenger who was unknown to him.  This is the story of that family against the backdrop of the sinking of the unsinkable Titanic...and it is a gem of a film.  Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb are magic on screen and were perfectly cast. Robert Wagner, Thelma Ritter, Brian Aherne, Richard Basehart and the beautiful Frances Bergen (Edgar's wife & Candice's mother) as Lady Astor, in a rare appearance, round out the cast. Jean Negulesco directed.",1492732800,4,1277,4.7342342342342345

646208,4,6303396623,"Hadn't been aware of this cinematic account of the famous 1912 sinking, but am glad I found it. The acting is superb, and the script is literate and at times moving. The final scenes of the Titanic going down amid the explosions of the boilers is nothing less than stirring and, given the age of this film, quite extraordinary. When reviewing this film, most of the attention goes to the fictional marriage between the two principal actors, and rightly so. However, I found the love affair between the two young protagonists, including a very youthful Robert Wagner, quite moving and well portrayed. Towards the end, Robert Wagner looks into the eyes of his love interest, whom he has met on the boat, and says as she is about to enter the lifeboat that will save her but not him, (paraphrasing), 'I would not have missed this trip for anything.'

It seems to stick very closely to the historical accuracy of the real Titantic sinking, much better then what clips I have seen of the newer version that is out. I wouldn't see that because it is just too far from the true facts that transpired. Another to consider is A Night to Remember which another version of the Titantic disaster very nicely done. It was out before this one I would have to look up the year but at any rate this is a wonderful movie, I am a big Barbra Stanwyck fan and as always she is wonderful in this movie you will not be disappointed.

646337,5,6303396623,This DVD is a must buy. Naturally Titanic 1953 was not one of the greatest Titanic Movies made with the amount of historical inaccuracies.

646338,4,6303396623,"The movie itself was okay, although not exceptional (my own opinion).  As typical with films of that era, it tended to drag a bit with involvement of the lives of the characters.  Not saying that as a flaw, but it probably could have been a little better.  Fans of all things Titanic and classic movie buffs will certainly want this in their collection.

The real gem, to me, was the documentary that is included in the bonus features.  'Beyond Titanic', which is a little more than an hour in length, is a spectacular look at the ongoing legacy of the almost mystical ship.  While a bit dated, it covers various films, plays, musicals, TV episodes, and books relating to or inspired by the Titanic.

646535,4,6303396623,"Though not as accurate as A Night to Remember, this is a decent film of the times. It is more about the troubled marriage of an uppercrust couple and their children played out as the Titanic sinks. There are errors in the portrayal of the sinking, such showing the tear of the hull on the wrong of the ship, showing porthole as being horizontal when should be at an angle, failure to show hull breaking apart in final moments, etc. Though the producers claim the characters are based on actual people, the film shows chiefly fictitious characters, so it is not a biographical film. What makes this DVD worth having is the 94 minute documentary Beyond Titanic which goes over each and every Titanic film ever made, no matter how obscure. Plus the documentary discusses the legend and legacy of Titanic in popular culture in other mediums, and the important discovery of the actual wreck by Robert Ballard. Well worth seeing. There are two worthless Movietone Newsreels, an interesting audio essay, two feature length audio commentaries, a still gallery {which did not work}, and settings for subtitles.

646599,5,6303396623,"I encountered my first book about the Titanic in a neighbor's collection when I was ten or twelve years old. My interest was captured and life long! Imagine my thrill at age twelve or thirteen in 1953 when this film was released. The screenplay won that years Oscar for original writing. All navigational details in the screenplay were taken directly from the two governmental inquiries, conducted by the United States Senate and the British Board of Trade. The two lead characters, Julia Sturgis and Richard Ward Sturgis, played by Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb, were fictional, but, their story was interwoven with others of the real characters who were on board. While the James Cameron film of 1997 was astounding with it's accurate and detailed depiction of the ship itself, it's interior furnishings and engine room, the story line was arguably less plausible than that of the 1953 film. The few years later 1958 English film ""A Night To Remember"", also now available in Blu-ray, had more realistic and accurate characters, but, had less dramatic appeal than the other two films as the characters are really not well developed. This Blu-ray release of the 1953 film is superb, although the erroneous underwater depiction of the striking of the iceberg, starboard side not port side, remains uncorrected.",1428451200,,1313,5.083333333333333

646635,5,6303396623,"This 1953 B & W Video of the Titanic is excellent entrertainment. Don' let the fact that it is in B &W convince you it is not as good as the more recent Color version. It has a far better cast and the stories and actions of the passengers on the ship are far more interesting.  As to the accuracy of all the details that is something else. When it comes to making a movie of an event like this ,or one such as ""Pearl Harbor"",""Gone With The Wind"",""The Gunfight at the O K Corral"", The Alamo"" ,etc., historical accuracy of details usually takes a back seat. If historical accuracy is what you are looking for, it can be found in books and investigations in much greater detail and accuracy, than a 1 1/2 to 3 hour movie. However,the emotions ,suffering,trauma ,impact on people during the event,etc.,are far better portrayed by the skills of great screenwriters, who get to have more license with details.
 If you wish to see more about incorrect historical details,they can be found on Wikipedia under ""Titanic Movie 1953 Historical Accuracies""
 I have been a Bridge player for many years and really enjoyed the scenes of passengers playing Brige ,almost from the beginning of the voyage until its demise. Today,when a play is trumped,and then overtrumped;an expression used is ""Never send a boy on a man's job"".I really got a kick out of Telma Ritter (1902-1969),playing the role of Maude Young,the only woman playing among the three men using the expression,""Never send a baby to buy the beer."",to convey the same expression.
The video is 97 minutes long and the sound,photography and entertainment value uis excellent.

Thelma Ritter is always a joy and for once, Clifton Webb in the end is a man to be admired.
Providence sets everything straight and the most noble attributes of humankind are revealed.

They sure don't make them like this anymore. I'm sure there are many people who would say Thank God they don't, but frankly for all it's glitz, glamour and panache, the 1997 James Cameron Titanic was like an overproduced runaway train. It is enjoyable, it is highly entertaining, it's got it's fair share of hokeyness (God only knows) but as I've said before in other comparisons of old vs new versions, the old directors understood how to distill a story to it's essence without sacrificing the visual lusciousness.
The older movies also stirred the imagination, which IMHO is part of the magic of the old movies and what movies should do; the introduction of computer graphics and a whole new philosophy on filmmaking has taken a great deal of that away.",1426464000,,1024,4.683333333333334

The manner in which the dramas are shown are sophisticated and well-presented.  When one watches this movie, he/she gets to know the characters in the movie and becomes a part of the tragic event.

647279,4,6303396623,"I'm a big Barbara Stanwyck fan and I'm interested in Titanic stuff, but I never heard of this movie. A pleasant surprise!

Clifton Webb (an odd duck in real life if ever there was one) is superb as a shallow man of wealth and position. He plays her husband, who finagles his way onto the Titanic where wife Streisand is running away from him with their two children.

The details about the Titanic sinking itself are rather thin (which is OK, since everyone watching this probably knows exactly what happened.) This movie focuses on people and their stories. You might think that that's what Cameron's Titanic did, but uh, not quite.

There's good acting here, not overdone or overblown, and no soaring Celine Diva song background (thank God.)

This movie is almost like the distaff side of ""A Night to Remember,"" another black and white Titanic classic. That one was drawn from first person accounts, and is superb in its way. This one has fictional accounts of the people onboard, but it dovetails nicely with ""A Night to Remember."" The two movies would make a great combo on a DVD.

647330,4,6303396623,"This early black and white version of the oft filmed drama surrounding the great ship disaster in 1912 has much to offer.  Like the more famous James Cameron epic film, this one invents a storyline to supplement the tragedy of the ship's fate.  Julia Sturges (Barbara Stanwyck) is an American living in England after marrying a wealthy upper crust socialite played by Clifton Webb.  Julia is taking her two children, teenage Annette (Audrey Dalton) and pre-teen Norman (Harper Carter), back to Michigan to get away from her snooty husband and save the kids from the formality of the British upper class.

Mr. Sturges discovers what is happening and manages to get aboard the ship at the last minute.  After the couple fight over the split, Julia drops a bomb on her hubby regarding Norman's parentage.  When the ship clips the ill-fated iceberg, the family's emotions take a backseat to the promise of what is to come.

The special effects are surely nothing like what is available today, but were certainly worthy at the time.  Watch for 22 year old Robert Wagner as a tennis player travelling with his Purdue University team.  He has a romantic relationship with young Annette.  Also recognizable is Thelma Ritter as Maude Young, a probable substitute for ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown.  Veteran TV actor (""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"") Richard Basehart plays an alcoholic defrocked priest.  This is a well-paced drama with an excellent screenplay and certainly worth a look.",1360886400,,1476,4.979591836734694

647332,5,6303396623,"Admittedly not historically accurate in all it's details, nevertheless I think this film depicts well, through fiction, the kind of human drama that undoubtedly occurred on the Titanic. Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck portray husband and wife, with children, grown distant from one another and expecting nothing more than a long sea voyage in uncomfortable proximity to one another - destiny has other plans. How might your relationship with other people change if you suddenly found yourself, with them, on a sinking ship?",1359849600,,525,5.337349397590361

647334,4,6303396623,"The 411 by Maria:

Well by now unless you are living in a cave you know about the fateful maiden voyage of the Titanic. A big boat, sets sail from England to New York but only 3 days into its North Atlantic voyage strikes an iceberg and sinks taking with it 1500 passengers mostly men. Without the big blockbuster budgets of 1997 I was expecting a less than stellar viewing while I fought falling asleep until the end. I LOVED it.

It is in black and white with many shots looks pretty pathetic and less dramatic than James Cameron's blockbuster but the decks, staterooms, and grand staircase are there as well as emotional relationships.

This time we don't have star crossed lovers meeting from different worlds as much as a couple going through a separation. Julia, (Barbara Stanwyck) is taking her two children Norman and Annette to escape a world that she feels has made them nasty, self righteous, egotistical, snobby people like their father Richard (Clifton Webb). Julia wants to raise them in her childhood home in Michigan so she takes them without telling Richard.

Richard buys his way onto the boat. The movie focus on Richard and Julia's relationship along with a few others tossed in for good measure so that we can see just how big hearted Richard and Julia truly are.

There are some funny lines and the movie is dated but that is what I love about it. Not sure why Annette calls her father angel but it is cute. I also love that even when she is about to tell her mother how mad she is, she tells her that she loves her.

Richard: Could you be common in a slightly lower voice.

Julia:  I'll say it in any tone you want! I'll whisper it. I'll write it down, but that's the way it's going to be! He stays with me!

Why do the British find it necessary to announce dinner as if it were a cavalry charge.

When the Titanic finally sinks into a very quiet demise. Unlike Cameron's Titanic there is no screaming or crying, just a water filled blast and the singing men and woman quietly go down while the shot goes wide so we can see all the waiting life boats in the foreground.

Even without the hoopla of today's effects, this movie is well worth a gander. The movie looks great for being 60 years old and who won't respect the actors of today after seeing the deliveries of these actors. Most of their acting is done through their expressions with all lines delivered very flat. Still it is a classic and should be respected.",1358985600,,2442,4.452914798206278

647424,5,6303396623,"The movie Jean Negulesco made of the tragic sinking of the Titanic is the best of them all, and there were many. This version has a strong cast that gives great performances; a believable story that manages to explore the character of a range of passengers and crew of widely different means and how each deals with the voyage and the ultimate sinking of the ship.

Maybe it's the stark beautifully photographed B&W but from first scene to the last you can't look away. What was it Norma Desmond said in Sunset Boulevard? ""we had faces"". In this version of Titanic, even the little boy had such an expressive face that it was amazing to watch.  Every role was a jewel of casting and performance. Who cares that it wasn't specifically accurate? This film takes you there and makes you care. I know that everyone says that ""A Night to Remember"" was much more accurate but it just wasn't as good a film. I thought all of the Special Features were wonderful except the commentary by the film critic. He can't say more than two words without saying ""uh"" which is terribly annoying.

647500,3,6303396623,"Actually, there were a great many movies made about the R.M.S. Titanic, but only a few were named just ""Titanic."" This is the old one. The one with Barbara Stanwyck, the actress my mother was thinking about when she named me.

Julia Sturges (Stanwyck) is taking her teenage daughter and her pre-teen son back to America because she is disgusted with her elegant husband Richard's globe-trotting. She mentions she doesn't want her children brought up in hotels, and he says ""Why not if they are the best hotels?"" He's an elegant Englishman, she's an American that he fell in love with and subsequently polished up to considerable glamor.

But Richard finds out what she's doing, and buys an immigrant's steerage ticket for enough money to allow him to buy considerable land for the winery his family intends to start in California, and he agrees to take the next ship. So his wife and two kids go aboard the Titanic with Mr. Sturges. He has remarkably little trouble finding his family and moving up from steerage, thus proving that you could do anything with enough money. Julia is really not willing to reconcile with Richard, even though he wants to. While they are arguing in their stateroom, he says, ""You look like a woman with a trump card to play, so you may as well play it now. You're not going to take my son away from me."" So she plays the trump card: ""He's not your son.""

There's a college student from Purdue to romance their daughter, and a group of aristocrats with whom to play a marathon game of bridge, along with a wealthy and rather uncultured American woman I expect is meant to represent Mollie Brown, but she has a different name. This is, after all, fiction.

Of course, we all know the story of the iceberg and all that. The specifics here are that Richard, accepting that there are not enough lifeboats, puts his wife and kids in a lifeboat, then goes to help the crew with the other boats. But when one woman was left out and is about to be turned away, young Master Sturges gives up his seat to her and goes down with the ship and his father. Of course, no one told him that Richard was not his father, and the tear-jerker last scene is father and son singing ""Nearer My God to Thee."" Which, I am told, was not actually the last thing the band played.

It's not a bad movie, but one cannot help comparing it to the more recent version, which is far more involving. These characters do not come alive to me, except the Purdue student.",1337126400,,2462,4.486607142857143

647612,3,6303396623,"Titanic, 1953 film

The movie begins with a view of ice cracking off glacier into the North Atlantic. The details of this story are taken from the official records of the investigation. The ship will sail a great circle route, the shortest route, to set a record. [Will this be closer to the cold arctic?] We see some of the 2,200 passengers on the ship. Richard Sturgess hurries to get aboard; money talks. Sturgess greets many old friends aboard ship. He has a conflict with his wife over life styles. Is he a snob? One man wants to send a telegram to Boston. The ship continues its passage. The Sturgess' family conflict continues. We learn more about their past. ""I think I understand."" She later meets a defrocked priest. The ""S.S. Baltic"" sends a warning about icebergs. We see a song and dance for entertainment. We see clumps of ice floating on the sea. First class passengers spend their time playing cards. Another iceberg warning is received.

""Iceberg dead ahead!"" The ship turns left, but scrapes against its side. There was damage, water is pouring in. A CQD is transmitted on the radio, the lifeboats are made ready. Are there enough lifeboats? Passengers must wear life jackets. [But icy water kills by hypothermia in 15 minutes.] Women and children are put into the lifeboats. The ship lists, then begins to settle in the water. When the water hits the boilers it will be all over. The band plays music. There is a low rumble from below. ""I didn't count on this."" The band plays ""Nearer My God to Thee"", and the remaining passengers join in. The boilers explode, and the ship plunges into the icy ocean.

The story ends without telling of the aftermath. New rules required enough lifeboats for all passengers. Ships would avoid the northern areas of the Atlantic (although this is the shortest route from Europe to North America). One reason for the disaster was the rivets used to hold the plates of the ship together. If too hard, they shattered from the force of the iceberg and the plates separated. There was a twin ship to the `Titanic', built at the same time. It was the ???.

The story of family conflicts in the upper class was used to add drama to this movie. Could it also symbolize the actions of the rulers of Europe that led to the Great War? This family conflict may have been shocking at the time but is now what you might see on the ""Jerry"" or ""Maury"" show today.",1305676800,,2398,4.582750582750583

647615,4,6303396623,"With acting talent on a scale commensurate with the name, this version of ""Titanic"" has been and always will be my favorite. It's difficult to consider the merits of the 1953 version without comparison to the Cameron make-over nearly forty-five years later.  But, if it's the glitz and razzle-dazzle of computer-generated graphics you're after, or a poignant story that translates into the interaction of individual complexities suddenly interrupted by a singular tragedy, the black and white version will capture your imagination.  For good reason, black and white movies provide a marked contrast when it comes to tragic tales and film noir - and, afterall, this is the epic voyage of contrasts - with the ship that God could not sink conveying its own arrogance, the very rich and the very poor with their contrasts of livelihood, as well as the contrasts of the iceberg against the dark background of an ink black sea and a star-laced sky, among others.

The story evolves around the Sturges family, dynamically portrayed by Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck - as Richard and Julia, their daughter Annette portrayed by Audrey Dalton, and son Norman portrayed by Harper Carter.  Torn from the onset, the Sturges family convenes for one last time aboard Titanic - where their destiny is interrupted by a pivotal event that will define who they really are and, sadly, bringing them closer together than they've ever been - just before tearing them apart.  The human interactions in this movie are deeply felt and can evoke deep emotions within the viewer.  A few of the sub-plots involve a ""brand new"" Robert Wagner as Gifford Rogers and his romantic interlude with Audrey Dalton's character, Annette, and a troubled young priest portrayed by Richard Basehart who is traveling back to his family after being dismissed from his religious servitude.

Yes, the special effects are exactly what you'd expect for 1953, but they vividly get the point across.  It's troubling to see that as the special effects have gotten better and better through the years - the stories have suffered, accordingly.  The perfect equilibrium seems to have occurred around the late fifties and early sixties with movies like ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Ben Hur"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and ""Doctor Zchivago"".

And, in terms of script and story, who could ever forget the line ""May I bone your kipper, Madmoiselle?"" eloquently spoken by Clifton Webb's character, Richard, to his daughter, Annette (Dalton) as she prepares to eat breakfast.  I have tried this line in my best Clifton Webb impersonation at several gatherings and still have several loose teeth as a result - funny what you pick up from the movies!

Stanwyck decides to separate from her spouse, taking their son and daughter under the ruse of a ""family"" vacation, with plans of eventual divorce in the US. Webb follows, trying to save his marriage. Wonderfully sensitive portrayal of family dynamics amidst marital dissolution: the unwitting, dont-have-a-clue kids who adore mom and dad, the resolute mother who wants the best for her kids---and herself, and the I-thought-I-was-doing-everything-right dad who loves his family and will not go down without a fight. You know the rest of the story. Webb's heartrending final instructions to his young son and declaration of eternal pride and love to his spouse as it's time to exit the sinking vessel is GREAT Hollywood drama at its best. No Diva was so evocative, and even sensual, shedding tears as the underrated Stanwyck, without doubt one of Hollywood's greatest dramatic actresses.

647723,4,6303396623,"With the recent passing of the final surviving passenger on the Titanic, Millvina Dean, it seems quite timely for me to be reviewing the 1953 film version starring Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Wagner.

Directed by Jean Negulesco, Twentieth Century-Fox's TITANIC was praised for it's innovative special effects (including some very impressive miniature work) and earned an Academy Award for 'Best Screenplay'.  While the story doesn't focus on real characters on the ship, preferring to create new ones to paint the various dramas onboard, it does feature genuine characters like John Jacob Astor and his young wife Madeleine (William Johnstone and Frances Bergen), and the Strausses (Roy Gordon and Helen Van Tuyl) in small peripheral roles.

TITANIC focuses on Richard and Julia Sturges (Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck), a married couple in crisis.  Sick of their empty, shallow life in Europe, Julia has decided to take her children, teenage Annette (Audrey Dalton) and young Norman (Harper Carter) back to her family in America, with or without the blessing of Richard who'd rather see Annette married into the European aristocracy.

Subplots include Annette's tender shipboard romance with collegiate bachelor Giff Rogers (Robert Wagner), and a never-ending poker game with brash Montana oil heiress Maude Young (Thelma Ritter), a character that is, for all intents and purposes, based on the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown but unable to be called so because of a legal skirmish with Ms Brown's estate.

While the Titanic itself is reduced to only a backdrop for these stories to play against, it remains a very compelling and dramatic film experience over 50 years later.  For trivia buffs, take special note of the lavish ship sets.  With minor re-dressing they were later used again  in the Fox productions of ""Dangerous Crossing"" and ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"".",1243814400,2,1865,5.316326530612245

Had the steel in the hull been of any where near modern hardness,
one doubts that ice could have cut through it.
Soft steel, a bad watch and a lazy crew who were enjoying themselves

However, as an accurate account of what happened on the Titanic, it's a dismal failure.  However, it was not made as a documentary.

I was excited about receiving the DVD version of this movie, because it included a commentary track.  I'm not so excited now.

The contributions by Audrey Dalton (wonderful actress- never got the chance she should have) about the filming and her interactions with Barbara Stanwyck and the others in the cast- plus the crew- are excellent.

The contributions by Michael Lonza about the special effects and Robert Wagner are good also.  (Mr. Lonza gets to be a bit of an irritation toward the end because he repeats himself.)

But the part by Sylvia Stoddard- listed as a ""Titanic Historian"" is awful.  She does nothing to clarify the accident and actually gets most of her commentary wrong.  This is surprising, since her credentials as a historian are beyond question- having written incisive and in-depth studies of the ""Brady Bunch"" and ""Gilligan's Island.""  She is also listed as a member of the Titanic Historical Society, an organization with a membership list as exclusive as the Publisher's Clearing house mailers.

These are just a few of her egregious transgressions:

-The reason ""Sir"" Bruce Ismay wasn't portrayed in the movie is because he was still alive at the time it was made and the producers were afraid of a lawsuit.  Bruce Ismay died in 1937 and he was never knighted.

-There was only ONE pair of binoculars on the WHOLE SHIP, and those were on the bridge.  The crows nest pair had been left ashore.  Actually there were several pairs aboard and the pair that were supposed to be in the crows nest was locked in one of the officer's cabins.  Fredrick Fleet, the lookout that spotted the iceberg said that the binoculars furnished by the company were of such low quality that they were next to useless anyway.

-There were no historical sources available about the Titanic when the movie was made other than the record of the two inquiries.  Apparently the sources we have available today sprang from nowhere later.

-Smith had decided to retire from White Star, but Ismay begged him to stay on until after Titanic's maiden voyage.  Actually, it's unclear whether Smith was going to retire at all, although most historians believe that he decided to make the voyage and then leave the line.

-Ismay was pushing Smith ""almost hourly"" about making a record passage.  Titanic's speed at the time of the accident was just about the same speed that her sister- Olympic- had been making on her maiden voyage.

-She has so much detail about the iceberg that she must have been in the crows nest herself and seen it personally.

-Nobody knows how the ship came to be tagged as ""unsinkable."" Actually, the reference came from a magazine called the ""Shipbuilder"" published in 1911.

-She tells everyone that the decision to steer to port was made because it's ""traditional"" for ships to pass objects on the port side.  The decision to pass is made based on location and relative speeds.

-She makes a statement that the movie gets the crows nest call ""Iceberg dead ahead"" correct, because if the lookouts said ""Iceberg right ahead"" the bridge would incorrectly interpret it as the iceberg being to the right of the ship.  Actually it would have meant the same to the officers on the bridge.  If the iceberg was to the right of the ship, the call would have been ""Iceberg off the Starboard bow.""  Fredrick Fleet, the lookout who reported the iceberg to the bridge stated that he did say ""Iceberg right ahead.""

I'm running out of room, but you get the idea.

648002,5,6303396623,"With all due respect to the superbly ""authenticised"" James Cameron 1997 ""Titanic"", which is supposedly NOT a re-make of this film (in essence it isn't, but in spirit it is), the fact remains that---when all the glorious technicolor and super CGI
FX of ""The Adventures of Jack & Rose"" is set aside---THIS film, the Fox 1953 version, all its faults included, is the DEFINING
dramatic narrative of the sinking of the Titanic. ""A Night to
Remember"" is more technically accurate, and the Cameron version more replete with verisimiltude (aided by discoveries made by and after Robert Ballard's 1985 discovery of the wreck) but this one is imbued with a heart and soul that the others can only approximate. THIS is the version that is truly riveting to watch.

The performances in this film are excellent. Barbara Stanwyck , the Meryl Streep of the Golden Age of Cinema, is awesome as usual, and what can you say about Clifton (""Richard Sturges"") Webb? This man, who looked like an ""everyman"" rather than a movie star, never did---in my estimation---turn in anything other than a top-knotch performance in anything he ever appeared in. And such a NATURAL actor, as well, working with the voice, the dialog, the body language, and the eyes...all in perfect sychronization. Webb was always right up there with Spencer Tracy in that respect.

Thelma Ritter as the Molly Brown clone, ""Maude Young"", turns in another of HER outstanding performances. Seems that ""Maude"" is a composite character. Molly Brown didn't play cards (in 1912 that was unladylike and Molly was reinventing herself into a ""proper matron"" of the time, so her card playing days were behind her in the Colorado Rockies). There was another woman on board ship who...SCANDALOUSLY...DID play bridge (she goes un-named here)...and this woman and the famous Ms. Brown were merged, scriptwise, into ""Maude Young"".

Robert Wagner's ""Giff Rogers"" is a memorable young ""swain"" for Audrey Dalton's ""Annette"". That legendary Wagner grin (unequaled in cinema until Tom Cruise showed up years later)
gets a full work-out in ""Titanic"", and Wagner's natural likeability makes it easily believable for Annette to fall for him. Wagner's ""Giff"" is someone you DON'T want to see die at all and the scriptwriters wisely chose to get him into a lifeboat. A balance is worked here, somewhat; ""Norman"" , the youngest Sturges,gets OUT of a lifeboat and dies, while ""Giff"" gets put INTO one and saved. Curiously, down through the years, one of the scenes that has most vividly stayed with me from this film is the scene where the young collegians and their girlfriends sing
college songs in the ship's salon while the captain listens in at the end of a long Sunday's work (not knowing he has less than two and a half hours to live). There's a strong poignancy to this scene...with Giff and Annette embracing lovingly to the singing of Cornell University's ""Far Above Cayuga's Waters""---that make the collision with the iceberg a few minutes later all the more emotionally wrenching. On the one hand you are shown young people who...supposedly...have their whole lives before them....and looking forward to living those lives...and, on the other, you have an older man, the captain, looking---he thinks---to the last years of his own existence with retirement looming. It is a reflective time for all of them.

But none of these people , young or old, has a CLUE about what fate has momentarily in store for them.

Very good sequence, well conceptualized and well executed onscreen.

It might also be noted here that some film historians say the underwater ""blooper"" that occurs when the ship hits a spur of the iceberg was inadvertent. Supposedly Ray Kellogg's FX team SHOT the scene to show the spur gouging the STARBOARD side
of the ship model, but, later, when the film was being edited,
the collision clip got reversed in splicing and this made the
rend appear on the PORT side of the ship. This, so it is said, went un-noticed thereafter and was never corrected.

Oddest story about this film is that 2nd Officer Charles Lightoller is one of the major heroic characters in the movie, AS he was in the real-life sinking. Edmund Purdom plays Lightoller in the movie (and was he ever considered for James Bond in ""Dr. No"" nine years later?), but he NEVER gets a screen credit ANYWHERE. A major character and an actor who gets no credit whatsoever!!!!

The movie also leaves the viewer with the impression...since Lightoller is shown standing on the deck singing ""Nearer My God to Thee"" before the last boiler explosion and the final sinking...that Lightoller ""went down with the ship"". Not so. He in fact commanded one of the collapsible boats and was one of the officers shown searching in the water for survivors after the plunge in Cameron's movie version. More to the point, Lightoller's heroism at sea was not over after that night. Twenty eight years later, when British army divisions had their backs to the English Channel at the French port of Dunkirk and Winston Churchill called on the British people to ""put every ship afloat that WILL float"" to try and save them from the advancing Germans, one old sixty-foot ""coaster"" that made many a run through the night to save soldiers (160 of them by this boat by the official government count) was captained by one Charles H. Lightoller...an honorable and courageous sailor his entire life.

I would tell people wondering about this DVD to give it a shot if they are not familiar with it. Cameron's ""Titanic"" is good, and ""A Night To Remember"" is good, but this one...this one is sheer magic. Oh, and the end narration is voiced by Michael ""Klaatu"" Rennie, but he left Gort back home when he did these vocals. Some very interesting ""special features"" turn up on this disc as well, one of them, called ""Beyond Titanic"" quite an interesting piece of filmmaking in itself.

Overall, a good job by the folks at Fox video.",1150675200,5,5907,4.880358923230309
648003,4,6303396623,"Probably the most memorable Titanic movie ever made, this is the one that started my Titanic fascination when I was 8 years old.  The writing is flawless, even if the same cannot be said for historical accuracy.  What a story!

Rather daring for it's time (1953), this film focuses on the turmoils of a troubled marriage and an illegitimate child loved dearly by both parents.  They all happen to be aboard the Titanic.  Only when the ship is sinking and death is imminent do the family squabbles get put aside.  There is a certain brutality to this film that is haunting.  It illustrates how quickly life and those we love can be taken from us.

You will want some Kleenex on hand when you watch this film.  Remarkably, a great deal of emotion is stirred without any musical score.  Only the  opening credits have theme music.  The rest of the film relies on acting, situation and dialogue--and does a beautiful job.  A certain elegance of simplicity dominates this story, which is barely more than 90 minutes long.

Historically, this movie is a total loser.  It fails to faithfully portray 1912--the prevailing atmosphere is distinctly 20th century, rather than residual Victorian.  The costuming is Fox Studios stock and looks more like World War One or later with Mrs. Astor sporting a skirt slit open at the front and revealing not only ankles but limbs!  Molly Brown, oddly, is portayed as ""Maude Young"", perhaps to avoid lawsuits or such.

The sets are generic period ""grand hotel"" but do convey the period and scale of the ship, though the illuminated toggle switches on the bridge and the modern telephones are clearly too modern.  You can see 1920's and 1930's framed photos of competitors' ships on the walls in several places.  There was no fog when the ship sailed from Cherbourg, or when it hit the iceberg.  The siren wailing as the ship sinks was a blunder, though it emphasizes calamity.  Latter-day exploration has revealed that no boilers exploded, though many witnesses swore they saw or heard explosions.  The boiler room set was magnificent, however, the best I have ever seen.

The collision with the iceberg was very well done, even if it did go awry with the underwater cut.  It illustrated best the subtle nature of the crash.  The model of the Titanic in this movie was only 28 feet long, barely more than half the size of the one in ""A Night to Remember"", but handled much better and quite convincing by 1950's standards.  It was incorrectly labelled ""Titanic--Southampton"" across the stern and some promenade deck windows were erroneous, but it looked good.

We all know there was no hymn-sing at the last moments, but I do support the theory that ""Nearer My God to Thee"" was played.  However, it was a string orchestra and not a brass band on the real Titanic.  The scene of the Strauses at the last lifeboat is a tearjerking masterpiece, the best reenactment of that particular moment I have seen yet.  The earlier sinking scenes showing the ship listing to port are dramatic and accurate--officers actually ordered passengers to the starboard side briefly at one point to level the ship.  The final plunge, though, was far too abrupt and swift.

For historical accuracy (not special effects), ""A Night to Remember"" (1958, British) is the best Titanic movie, but for drama this one is the winner.  Cameron's 1997 epic only delivered half the drama in twice the time and overexaggerated the breaking of the ship.  This movie is captivating in spite of it's flaws.

I enjoyed more watching the shorter and much better scripted 1953 Fox production.  The special effects are impressive by 1950s standards, even though the sinking scene is historically inaccurate.  (Hollywood disaster movies are not really about historical accuracy anyway.)  Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck are great as a couple on the verge of divorce and their storyline (dealing with class issues and marital infidelity) is what grounds the script and keeps things interesting while we wait for the iceberg to hit the ship.  As the young couple, Robert Wagner and Audrey Dalton are pretty to look at, but there's really not much chemistry and their acting is only so-so.  Unfortunately, Thelma Ritter, Richard Basehart and Brian Aherne, all great actors, were not given much to do in their supporting roles.

His wife that was supposed to be 18 I think it was looks like she is in her late 30's or 40's.  The band leaders name was also in correct in the movie as well as a strange edit where it shows the ship hitting the burg on the wrong side of the ship after turning the ship to the starboard side. To bring in the inaccuracy's of what happened while sinking and such is not fair since the ship was not found till 1985.

648011,5,6303396623,"I highly recommend this movie for history buffs, historians and fans of a good drama.

In this early Titanic retelling, a couple on the verge of divorce,(Barbara Stanwyk and Cliffton Webb) board the Titanic with their two children.  Their story is very taboo given the time, Stanwyk's character admits that another man fathered her son! An alcholoic priest, bannished by the church, seeks forgiveness.  An interestingly, Molly Brown is shown here as Maude Young, both with similar attitudes and history.  Bruce Ismay (Titanic's managing director) is represented here as Earl Meeker, a cowardly man who desperately tries to 'fit in' and escapes in a lifeboat.

I was not impressed with the set design, the interior that is.  The grand staircase was far too generic and fell short of the real thing as shown in James Cameron's version.  The outside of the liner is spot on.  The sinking, this was the only movie that I recall acknowledging the 'explosions' on the Titanic.  It's not known for sure if there were any though.  This movie failed to show the desperate passengers clinging to the stern as the ship went down. Nor did it show the ship split in two.  Although it wasn't until 1985 that it was proven that it had broke apart, so that's easy to overlook.

So all in all, this is a great movie and worth all the fanfare it garnered.  A classic oldie from a time when movies were made without all the glaring special effects, a time when the actors were the stars and were appreciated more than the special effects.",1099612800,8,1519,4.708333333333333

648093,4,6303396623,"first i'd like to say that i never thought the two sturges children acted like spoilt brats.  i thought they were well mannered and polite.  in a day and age where manners seem less and less important i thought that was refreshing to see.

stanwyck of course is right on the money as she is in all her performances that down to earth quality we see so many times in her work shines through here.  nothing is forced.  very natural.  webb to is perfectly cast as the snob with a heart of gold.

the captain in this version was portraied as being much more in charge at the end then in the cameron version.  i suppose he was a little of both at the end.

i thought cameron's version was just as thoughtful and tender as this older version.  especially in his use of james horners' haunting score.  it was interesting to note that there was similiar dialogue used.  in some places exactly the same.  such as the line 'why do the british find it necessary to announce dinner as if it were a calvary charge.' in the 53 version it's said by webb's character.  in the 97 version it is said by kathy bates.  i do think the opening scene of the 53 version was a clever idea,  showing the ice berg forming. question.  why is the molly brown character in the 53 version named 'maud young?'

all in all both versions broght different elements of the story in focus, and both were thoughtfully and brilliantly done.  vewiers should watch and enjoy both.  not as absolute historic fact though both versions took great care in trying to get details correct, but as films that capture the essence of what those people went through on the terrible night.  that's what a film makers job is.",1095206400,2,1671,4.413114754098361

Stanwyck brings a fantastic down-to-earth quality that you instantly connect to. Webb is equally good as the dispicable fop who wants his kids to live like royal spoilt brats. My only complaint about this DVD are the two commentaries. Film critic Richard Shickel's has to be heard to be believed for he literally sounds like he's half-asleep. He starts off with: ""Uh,and....uh, uh, and, uh, Barbara, uh, uh, Stanwyck, uh (long pause)is a fine, uh, uh, ehhhhhhh, ummmm, good actress."" The second one is slightly better because you can hear Audrey Dalton recall those long-gone days on the 20th Century lot making TITANIC. She's witty, interesting, but unfortunately has about ten minutes on the commentary. You're forced to listen to cameraman Michael Lonza's relentless spill about miniatures, special effects and water tanks. Worse, is the ""audio essay"" by Silvia Stoddard, who tells us such fascinating tidbits that ""Titanic was, well, just incredibly big!"" Robert Wagner repeats over and over again ""how lucky I was to be on a production like TITANIC.""

Pure fiction but hey, it's Titanic and its masterfully told.
TRANSFER: Fox is at its usual middle of the road with this transfer quality. Some scenes are nicely balanced with good gray scale.  Others seem to suffer from low contrast and black levels.  There's ample pixelization, aliasing and shimmering of fine details throughout.  The audio's been remixed to feeble stereo.  At this point does anybody care?

BOTTOM LINE: This is a worth while DVD for two reasons - the documentary and its price tag - cheaper than most low budget no-name studio releases.  If nothing else, you're buying the documentary and for that reason alone, it's definitely worth it!",1064880000,51,1225,4.731132075471698
648098,5,6303396623,"I bought the DVD yesterday, and couldn't wait to get home to watch it. It was worth it for the feature itself as well as an added feature: called Beyond Titanic. This little documentary went into great detail about the Titanic on film from 1912-present. It is a great shame that many of the very early Titanic films have vanished but or a few clips and stills.
Also the commentary by Richard Wagner, Audrey Dalton, and one of the stage crew are interesting. It's good to hear backstage memories. Will watch this movie again tonight!",1062633600,6,532,4.610526315789474
648099,5,6303396623,"What this film lacks in historical accuracy, it makes up for in the personal drama of Titanic's passengers as they sail unwittingly into the pages of history. It doeasn't deal in storybook romances or lost diamonds, but we are drawn into the story all the same......Love it, and will watch it again and again.",1057708800,2,309,4.7407407407407405
648100,4,6303396623,"Although theoretically the 1997 version is not a remake of this
wonderful film, I still don't see any reason for it to have been remade. The cast is excellent, and the special effects, while less spectacular than the new are still quite good. And that cast! Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb are wonderful, and how about that very very young Robert Wagner! Its the minor roles that stand out though. Thelma Ritter as the Molly Brown character and Richard Basehart as the defrocked priest come to mind,as do Brian Ahern as the Captain and Edmund Purdom as Lightoller. If it ain't broke,dont fix it OR REMAKE IT!",1008806400,5,610,4.710280373831775
7847080,5,6303396623,"Add mine to the rave reviews. Every time I watch this movie, I cry. It is so vastly superior to that more famous version of 1997! In this one, the domestic tension between Stanwyck's and Webb's characters would be gripping enough to carry an entire drama; its superimposition into the Titanic tragedy heightens it almost unbearably. Of the minor characters, I find not one feebly drawn, but grow interested in all of them.
The sinking of the Titanic could well have been the keynote tragedy of the twentieth century; and this film version brings forth the potential heroism of our bafflingly good/bad human race when faced with crisis, where the 1997 movie just tries to make it all look like some kind of ballet. I don't judge it on how accurate it is in all details, even by the research of 1953. (E.g., I feel fairly sure the character Thelma Ritter plays is based on Molly Brown, but she has been given a different name and otherwise probably lightly fictionalized.) But it gives one a sense of what it must have been like to be in that situation.",1524700800,,1051,4.595744680851064

The photo's were absolutely beautiful . The Movie had Great Stars in it, Richard Basehart, Barbara Stanwyck, & Clifton Webb. I cannot say enough about the Picture quality.
