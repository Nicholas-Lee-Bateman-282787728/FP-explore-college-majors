3797699,5,B001UDUR5Y,Very funny act.  My wife saw him on TV but it was cut and interrupted by commercials.  I had to get it for her.  She loved it..,1294963200,,127,3.6296296296296298
3797700,2,B001UDUR5Y,"We first saw John Caparulo on a comedy tour DVD with other comedians and found him very funny (and clean).  However, when we watched this DVD, we discovered his over use of the ""F"" word and that some of the topics weren't funny or appropriate.  Even the parts he did that were funny on the comedy tour we watched previously weren't as funny on this DVD.  He has some funny parts, but definitely not appropriate for a family viewing.",1293580800,2,432,4.443037974683544

3797797,5,B001UDUR5Y,"I always hear John Caparulon on the XM comedy channels and he always gets me laughing while I am driving.  I had to buy this movie to put a face to a voice.  His delivery adds more humor as I expected.  He is not added to one of my favorite comedians (ie. Tim Wilson, Rodney Carrington, Ron White, etc)",1414972800,,302,4.084745762711864

3797814,5,B001UDUR5Y,I saw John Caparulo on Chelsea Lately and really enjoyed his delivery style. I found this dvd on amazon and it was well worth it. I wish his routine was longer. There's just something about his delivery that hits my funny bone!!!,1400716800,,229,4.476190476190476

3797819,4,B001UDUR5Y,I love Cap but hate his bad language. Anyone as funny as he is and with such great material does not need to use four letter words. I would like it a lot better  ihe did not use them.,1391385600,,183,3.6923076923076925
3797820,5,B001UDUR5Y,"I think John Caparulo is hilarious and this is a great DVD of his. His act will keep you laughing over and over. Though I feel I should mention some people may end up offended by some of what he says. He's definitely not the most extreme comedian I've ever heard, but he does quite a bit of swearing. This is a must see if you are a stand-up fan. My favorite part of this whole act though, is the road rage section. Once you watch it you will know what I mean (especially if you have road rage).",1374624000,2,495,4.01010101010101

3797822,4,B001UDUR5Y,Caparulo is one of the funniest young men to come along.  Not for feint of heart in the language department.,1367193600,3,108,4.4
3797823,5,B001UDUR5Y,"Check out the reviews from this same titled DVD - almost all are 5 stars. He deserves it, this Is a hilarious routine. He does drop some ""F"" bombs throughout, but it's nothing I wouldn't even mind watching with my older parents, it's just not that offensive. Quality standup comedian at the top of his game.",1366934400,,307,4.5

3797859,5,B001UDUR5Y,Caparulo is hilarious - part of the new Blue Collar crew - he has some great bits and is very entertaining. I have seen him live and this DVD really captures the majority of the best part of his acts. Definitely has replay value.,1333756800,6,229,4.2272727272727275
3797860,5,B001UDUR5Y,Cap made a great Valentines day gift for my husband. Cap is very very funny. We both enjoyed his humor and the way he delivered his stand-up. Watched it several times and shared with friends. I highly recommend the DVD.,1330214400,,219,4.5
3797861,5,B001UDUR5Y,Brilliant humor!  John Caparulo will take you out of your seat whit his comedy routine.  Either making you fall out of your chair or to the bathroom because you are laughing so much,1322870400,,181,4.454545454545454
3797862,3,B001UDUR5Y,"This review is for the 22-minute sample of Caparulo on stage somewhere.

The guy is funny; I've been a fan since hearing him on my XM radio recently, so I opted for this short program.

I have a pretty good computer, capable of handling HD video without a hitch.  The quality of this video is simply not what I expect of an Amazon product.  It would be fine, I suppose, if I were still using my old machine but this is simply disappointing.

I suppose that for $1.99 I really should not gripe about it but so what.",1313366400,,514,4.204081632653061
3797863,5,B001UDUR5Y,"I didn't know John Caparulo until I heard one of his bits on satellite radio recently.  It was so funny that I eventually went to Amazon.com to see if he had any videos or CDs for sale.  That's where I found Meet Cap, one of the funniest stand up routines I've seen in years.  Caparulo's very unique, self-effacing delivery is peppered with just enough profanity that it's funny without being over-the-top offensive. I love Chris Rock, but the f-bombs become mind-numbing after a while.  Not so with Caparulo. Although a little raw now and then, his material is so funny.
