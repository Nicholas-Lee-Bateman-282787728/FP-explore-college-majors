8572302,1,B000LE4JA2,"Highly cheap and unprofessional.  You will not see Vancouver island here.  All you will see if you buy this DVD is a bunch of wanna be ""explorers"" fooling around.  They show you everything possible but Vancouver island.  After fooling around for about 40 min +, they tell you how beautiful Vancouver island is.  This DVD is not worth to watch it for free.  Watch only if somebody pays YOU $20 instead of you paying this price for this.  I want to repeat: YOU WILL NOT SEE VANCOUVER ISLAND ON THIS DVD.",1174089600,3,501,4.43956043956044
