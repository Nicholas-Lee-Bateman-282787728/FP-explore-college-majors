7153617,3,B00WSSC6E0,"Miranda (Rosamund Pike) is a small town nurse and cake decorator. She is cool, calm, and calculating and lives alone. She is overly occupied with the thoughts of germs, and dreads sharing a pen. Her friend hooks her up with a blind date (her ex). By coincidence another man, William Finn (Shiloh Fernandez) shows up at her door and rapes her. The only way things could get worse is if her dad was Nick Nolte... with a dog..and it was.

William goes to prison and Miranda has trouble functioning as a twitch has developed in her hand. Strangely, the distressed victim visits her attacker in prison, apparently some kind of odd therapy.

For some reason I didn't see the overly predictable end coming. Rosamund gave us an excellent performance in a what qualifies as a low budget ""B"" drama/thriller.

So Rosamund Pike (who I adore) plays an rising upcoming nurse, and her world seems to be going as planned. She's going to get the job she's being working so hard to get, selling her old house for a new, and everything is perfect. Until she gets raped by a man she assumed was supposed to be her blind date. Suddenly her world starts to crumble, she can't focus, she's angry, no one wants to buy her house, and she has a twitch in her hand when she's trying to focus which costs her the job she worked so hard to get. One would think to be angry, and want revenge... So why is she going to prison and talking to the rapist? Suddenly, she's talking to him about her past, asking about his, and wanting to fix things in between? All this leads to a shocking ending, and is worth watching... Some what.

Spoilers below

Okay, WTF! I loved the idea of her getting revenge on him. Like a real life operation game! I wanted to see what she did to him, did she neutered him? What did she do to him on that table... You never know, because you don't see. Then she's going to drop that bombshell that she allowed her mother to die? Why! You never know, because they never tell you! Because shortly after, it just ends! Doesn't tell you how she killed him, what she did to him, if she even did kill him, I'm assuming he's still in the basement being the human operation game for her. It just ends and give no answer to any of the questions they left. I get the whole idea of a cliff hanger, but this is not a cliff hanger. This is just ending the movie right at the climax, and thank God I didn't pay to see this.
Terrible!
I'm in a love hate relationship with this movie, because the cast was great, the writing was awesome, and the story would have been perfect if they had ended the movie properly. I mean... Come on! Ugh, this just sickens me.",1457395200,4,2097,4.213930348258707

7153655,1,B00WSSC6E0,"A rape movie with no rape scene. What's the point of even watching this movie. It's like watching fast and the furious except whenever they get inside their cars to race them the movie just fades to black and then cuts to them after the race. I'm sorry but these rape revenge or whatever movies don't work without a brutal rape scene so you can sympathize with the characters agony. The punishment has to be equal to the crime. Without it it's like a major point of the story is missing. You can't have a brutal revenge story without showing the reason why the revenge is so brutal. There was also another movie about rape revenge that starred Rosario Dawson that did the same fade to black thing. That movie was also equally a mess. When will these directors get that a successful rape revenge movie IS BASED AROUND FILMING A GRUESOME RAPE! otherwise the movie just falls flat. You can't connect with the main character unless you understand her plight. The last house on the left did it, I spit on your grave did it, a bunch of other movies did it and they all made sense. What I'm basically saying is that if you're going to do a movie based around rape you better go ALL OUT on it and not tip toe around it because it doesn't work and neither did this crap.",1451779200,3,1261,4.3474576271186445
7153656,4,B00WSSC6E0,"Yes, this movie telegraphs some of its plot points. But I still found enough to really surprise me at the end. I also found myself looking back on this movie more than I usually do with movies I view as casual thrillers. I found myself considering clues Id missed at first. Was there a clue in the proffered piece of jerky, albeit a subtle psychological one? Were there deeper layers of implication to the Operation Game than I had at first caught?

All-in-all, I found this to be an interesting, well-acted suspense movie, with more tightly scripted, intriguing associations than a viewer might at first suspect. Rosamund Pike did an especially good job of portraying her reaction to the trauma she experienced. When she holds her hand out horizontally in front of her face, to test the degree of trembling shes still suffering - I got an eerie sense that she was experiencing her hand as something separate from herself, something with a life of its own. I recalled some of the better movies of the 50s in which a severed body part is animated, with frightening results.

And theres a valuable moral to be drawn here - namely that there might be more to the totality of an individuals villainy than is at first apparent.",1450483200,,1222,4.652777777777778

The problem here is; it was made pretty clear what the protagonist's intentions were and what she did, but the curtain was closed a split second before the reveal. That made the audience feel teased and then cheated. In a revenge film, which this pretty much is, the main pleasure is seeing the bad guy or girl get their comeuppance.

7153668,3,B00WSSC6E0,"Warning do not read if you haven't seen the film...the script left off too many questions regarding the main character Miranda's past and absolutely no character development.  For example Miranda seems to have a germ phobia hence wanting to write with her special ordered pens, and there is a scene in the movie at the dry cleaners where she almost refuse to sign a receipt because she couldn't find a pen in her purse and tried to refuse to use plenty of ones the lady had at the store.  Miranda also appeared to loath her deceased mother from whenever her father talked of her or tried to keep her memory, Miranda shot it down or ignored it. If the writer's would have developed Miranda's backstory, like if she let her mother die or caused her death, show a flash back.  Which may have helped with, why did she kill her father's dog?  It wasn't all bad just needed further development with the characters to make it believable and have more of an impact instead of leaving you with tons of unanswered questions.",1447113600,4,1014,4.554945054945055

7153678,3,B00WSSC6E0,"Nice thriller. Rosamund Pike plays an ambitious nurse who is in the process of selling her house and furthering her career when she is set up on a blind date. Simple enough, but when a man shows up on her doorstep she assumes he is the blind date and invites him in and that is where the story really takes off.  This movie is a twisty sometimes scary and sometimes sultry ride about a disturbed woman with a troubled past trying to make amends for it who's life is thrown into turmoil after the attack. And her attacker the dark yet sexy Shiloah Fernandez plays a character named William who seems to bounce back and forth sometimes childlike and sometimes scary.

Give credit to Pike who between Gone Girl and this movie gives another very complicated performance as a woman on the edge who is hard to read and that is whats fun about her. Is she all that innocent and a victim or is she a manipulator awaiting her time to strike.  I will say that this movie gives us another open ended finale that lets the viewer wonder what happened for themselves.. I have an idea SPOILER/OPINION.......I think that she castrated him and buried him next to the dog possibly but I definately think it was a castration.

All in all a nice thriller with some twists, nicer perfomances from Pike, Fernandez and supporting role from Nick Nolte as Rosamund's father.",1446163200,8,1349,4.539094650205762

""But things are not as they seem..."" We get it. We are also supposed to believe a woman as beautiful as Rosamund Pike needs to be set up on a blind date by her frumpy friends.

Maybe it could be because I go out of my way not to see trailers, read reviews, or promos of any kind before I view a movie.
  Had I known this was a ""revenge"" movie beforehand, I am not sure the twist at the would've worked for me as well as it did!  You see, I was going with the idea that the rapist would maybe attack her at the end as most rapists rarely get re-habilited...Once a rapist, always a rapist. We did see his cocky, arrogant attitude while staring at those girls at the motel while on the phone with Miranda...and he was an immature jerk at the hardware store...
  So when it turned out Miranda was a social-path of the highest order, I was surprised!!
She wasn't a ""strong"" woman so much as a smart, clever woman destroyed in everyway by her own experience of ultimate emotional damage, the rape...she snapped...

Unfortunately the movie is totally predictable - anyone who has seen a revenge thriller will know exactly what is going to happen by the end of the movie almost from the very beginning. Rosamund Pike is lovely to watch and if you liked her in Gone Girl, her character is rather similar here. Even when she is being the wonderful nurse, daughter and friend, you can see a few cracks in the perfect veneer - a little OCD, a twinge of malice under the guise of friendship (she constantly urges food on a friend who is trying to lose weight) and hints of a tragic past. There is obviously a very complicated personality hidden beneath the angelic face and innocent looking sun dresses. The villain is wonderfully creepy. The real tragedy is that they couldn't be bothered to write a better script. Besides being predictable, it is so loaded with lame fat girl jokes that have no apparent purpose and only distract from the story that I had to wonder if the writer has some self loathing issues or some psychological hangups. At any rate, it seems that someone wanted to capitalize on Gone Girl and hastily wrote a vehicle for Rosamund Pike to star in without taking the time to make it better. And she is fabulous in it, so probably worth watching once just to see her performance. If I ever see it again though, I will fast forward through all the extraneous silliness that is so distracting and adds nothing to the story.",1443830400,2,1475,4.569811320754717

The only part that was a little disappointing is the part right before the last scene. I'm not sure the sarcasm of Rosamund Pike's character was the best idea.  Also, though I didn't mind tremendously, the fate of William (the rapist) was completely predictable, especially because of the dog.  I believe the dog situation should have been left out.

I am interested by any movie review that says things move too slowly.  I like to see slow moving plots sometimes.  My life can be frenetic enough that sometimes it's good to just watch a movie that lets you see the background (the house, garden) without hitting the freeze frame.

Not much major plot suspense but there is minor suspense because I couldn't predict exactly what would happen and when.

7153741,1,B00WSSC6E0,"The movie was so slow, and I lost interest pretty quickly.  I basically gave up and started doing housework as it played on my Blu-Ray, but I caught enough of it to grasp the weird plot.  Is it realistic that a woman who has been raped would pretend to eventually like her rapist, just to get even with him?  I didn't think so.  And then came the ending.  It left too many loose ends and questions.  Yes, it was pretty satisfying when the rapist met his fate, thanks to Rosamund Pike's character, but it also left the viewer wondering if she was just as evil as he was.  Overall, it was just a horrible, twisted movie with an ending that just left too many unanswered questions.  Horrible.

Here's a bone I will throw to make up for the one star I was required to give: The cast. However, I couldn't find Ryan Phillipe anywhere.  Not in the opening credits and not in the movie.

The movie has a decent pace, Pike carries the movie very well on her own although we do get occasional scenes with her father played by an old Nick Nolte (who's very hard to understand at times with his mumbling)
the rest of the cast is fine, there is not an amazing amount of suspense really apart from the short (not graphic) rape, the ending of course is the payoff, nice little twist that is kind of predictable, but its still great fun to see how it plays out, the ending is one of those that leaves you wondering too which is annoying in a way, but overall certainly check this out, a great thriller worth watching for the amazing Rosamund Pike alone, not one of the best movies of its kind but still good work!!!

8714114,4,B00WSSC6E0,"This movie was the oddest movie I've seen in a long time. It was extremely weird because it doesn't fit into a neat little box in terms of genre. This can be a good and bad thing. First off, the acting was wonderful and Nick Nolte stole the show as Miranda's loving yet protective father. These two have a somewhat strained relationship due to the death of Miranda's mother but they show a lot of affection toward each other as well. Rosamund Pike and Nolte were very realistic in their portrayals and complimented each other's characters. Without this bond, the movie would've been very one-note and predictable. It's the family aspect that jolts the viewer because you don't expect that type of drama in one of these rape-revenge movies. It was nice to see the filmmakers go an extra step to not make this just some cheesy film to get quick reactions.

William (the rapist) was great as well and extremely charming. He was a rapist, the worst thing someone can be, yet he was so darn charming and sexy that you had to remind yourself of the despicable stuff he did to Miranda. He is a multifaceted villain, one that makes you pity him and even become attracted to him. As a woman, I stepped into Miranda's shoes and could tell at one point she did seem to soften up to William though revenge was on her mind. There was a couple crucial scenes when she visited him in prison that you could tell she felt something for him beyond hate. She pitied him deep down. She hated what he did but found it hard to separate the man she'd start to get to know outside of being a rapist and that he'd raped her. Wow. It's been a long time where characters made you second-guess who they are. We are supposed to hate William. We SHOULD hate William but sometimes it is hard to hate William even when we want him to get what he deserves so Miranda can have peace.

Rosamund Pike was amazing. I've always liked her and can't understand why she isn't a bigger actress. She's finally getting roles in bigger movies but she has been overlooked by Hollywood far too long. She can out act a lot of these A-list actresses. I don't think anyone could play Miranda but her. She made that character. Just like the plot, Miranda is not one-note either. She is just as multifaceted as William. On one hand she's a loving, concerned nurse who won't think twice to save a man when he is choking. But after William rapes her in the kitchen, we see the light draining from her eyes. She changes right before us into something hard to recognize. Miranda is still a kind person but her heart is empty and her eyes are a little darker and she becomes more and more obsessed with getting revenge on William.

I'd be here all day if I spent more time describing this movie. It's super-character driven and too deep and heavy to describe in one review. It's one of those movies you have to watch for yourself. This won't be everyone's cup of tea. If you are expecting I'll Spit on Your Grave or some other torture-revenge flick then, no. This movie won't appeal to you. If you want a film with a woman being raped who whines and cries about not getting justice, then this film is definitely not for you.

This film is about a woman who has something taken away from her that she can never get back and she allows herself to go to the dark side to reclaim what she's lost. I guarantee that even if it's not your cup of tea, you will never have seen a movie like this before.
