8508271,5,B0071CL8L0,"I haven't watched them all yet. But I found these after my grandmother and I were watching the old television show Scarecrow and Mrs. King. When she saw Beverly Garland as Amanda's mother, she commented that she was a policewoman on another show. We are all excited to go back in time to watch this season too!",1421452800,4,310,4.456140350877193
8508272,3,B0071CL8L0,"The series Decoy is great and Beverly Garland is pitch perfect. Just be aware that these dvds seem to have been taken from public domain versions and haven't been remastered or cleaned up. The quality of the dvds is just okay, though the series itself is terrific.",1392508800,5,264,4.638297872340425
8508273,4,B0071CL8L0,"I bought this DVD.because I have ever seen this movie when I was a child. I think,in some case,female police officers can work better than male police officers. Decoy police woman can easily entice criminals for easy arrests because of her charm. Beverly Garland plays the role of Casey Jones perfectly. The series also features early performances by such future stars as Larry Hagman and Peter Falk. Decoy Police Woman  is one of my favorite American TV.series of all times.",1370995200,5,475,4.9375
