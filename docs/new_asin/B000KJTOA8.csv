8157474,2,B000KJTOA8,"Im a big fan of Space related documentaries and shows like ""The Universe"", so i was excited to receive this DVD after it had been in the saved que for so long( I watched it through Netflix).  It is not what i expected however.  Its kind of like a NASA home video, the image quality is kind of muddy, a lot of the footage is older.  There is no sound at all in a film aching for some background music and also a narrator would have been nice, even subtitles telling me what im looking at.  There is just silence.  Some of the footage is neat to see, but most of it is just slow and boring as you watch the earth rotate on its axis in real time.",1249689600,,643,3.953488372093023
