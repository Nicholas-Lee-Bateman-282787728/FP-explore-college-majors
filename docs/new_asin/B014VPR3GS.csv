7424935,1,B014VPR3GS,"This DVD set arrived in good condition but was in a format that my players will not accept.  I tried all discs and none would start.  At the bottom of the back, in a tiny box, was the term ""Beta"".  I assume this is the old Sony format that failed in the market place?  Returning the set to AU was not an option.

7424945,5,B014VPR3GS,"Love the remake!  While the original film is one of my favorites from my teen years, the mini-series stayed much truer to the book in the story line. Hate the mini-series version of the Navigators though because the original movie got it dead-on!  But that is honestly the only thing I think was better in the original version.  Just an overall joy to watch for those that like the books and like to watch movies that are very similar.",1482192000,2,435,4.481012658227848
7424946,3,B014VPR3GS,"I've owned the DVDs of this amazing SciFi series for many years, and was extremely disappointed when I re-watched it recently on my new large screen TV. Therefore I was in search of a Bluray release of this great adaptation of Dune. I was surprised that there had not been a US Release of this, however this Region Free Bluray worked (at least in the limited testing I performed) and looked simply amazing when played on my US Xbox One.

Now the bad news: The Fremen Language portions of this series are subtitled (using hard/burned in subtitles) in FRENCH! This is a total shame. Additionally there are still no Subtitles (I prefer to watch films with them on) they were also missing from the DVD release I owned.

Unfortunately it seems like we'll need to wait for a proper US release to get everything we want, but for now this will have to do.",1477872000,9,847,4.4935064935064934

8731988,3,B014VPR3GS,"I'm not reviewing the miniseries itself, just the technical merits of this disc:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dune-Blu-ray/dp/B014VPR3GS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dune [Blu-ray</a>]. Take it for granted that the show is worth your while.

While the miniseries received its definitive release on DVD with the Special Edition Director's Cut (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dune-Special-Edition-Director-s-Cut/dp/B0000639EV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dune (Special Edition, Director's Cut)</a>), it has never had a US Blu-ray release. I hoped that this recent all-region import would suffice, and it does, but with significant caveats.

This is the international broadcast version. It has most of the content of the Director's Cut, with the exception of 5 extended scenes, totaling a little more than 5 minutes, four in episode 1 and one in episode 2. None are critical losses, mostly cuts for broadcast time. The credits and burned-in subtitles are in French. There are no subtitle tracks (none on the DVD either). The audio tracks are fine: DTS-MA 5.1 surround in English, and a Dolby Digital stereo track.

The video track is problematic though:
  - It's in PAL format. This means that your Blu-ray player must be capable of recognizing and decoding PAL video and either pass it to a PAL-capable display or convert it to NTSC. Then, if you can play it at all, it plays 4% fast (25 fps instead of 24fps). I didn't find the PAL speedup objectionable since the audio wasn't also pitched up, but it's not the original presentation.
  - The effects shots weren't rendered or composited in high definition, but up-converted, so they are noticeably softer than the rest of the show. This only became distracting for me when the picture sharpness appeared to switch back and forth within the same scene but it's noticeable throughout, especially on a large screen. However, a surprising number of ""effects"" shots were achieved in camera, so there's no loss in resolution when only practical effects are in frame. This limitation is inherent to the source material and will likely never be improved upon.
  - By and large, the video track appears to be simply ported over from the French broadcast HD feed. PAL format instead of native 24fps, no English forced subtitles, credits in French, etc. It's a real shame the publisher was unable or unwilling to strike a HD master from the original 24fps film element, or at least re-encode the video and audio tracks back to 24fps.

None of the special features of the Director's Cut are on this disc, including the director's commentary track, but there are two 30-minute documentaries on making the miniseries, in PAL HD.

So, is this disc the definitive HD version? Sadly, no. There's no help possible for the soft looking effects shots so the video quality is as good as it will ever be, and the audio mix is terrific. A disc with the remaining few scene extensions restored, encoded at its native 24fps instead of PAL, and with forced subtitles and credits in English would be an easy recommendation, but this one just isn't there.",1510531200,7,3157,5.344758064516129
