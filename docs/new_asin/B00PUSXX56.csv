6822051,5,B00PUSXX56,"She's not nearly annoying like she looks like she might be.  Really fun to do.  I do this for about 20-30 minutes including warm up, (don't learn/practice all of the video at once), and then I follow it up with another video.  I really get a fun workout.",1448841600,,254,4.25
6822052,4,B00PUSXX56,I wish there were more specific instruction on finding and isolating the muscles she uses but love the video is fun and keeps your attention,1448064000,,140,4.64

Shahrzad has a friendly presence. She is a very good dancer. I was surprised at the drummer being a bit shy maybe? He hardly ever smiles and I was under the impression that he tries not to look at the dancer. However, he accompanies the moves very well with different rhythms. It is a nice DVD even if I expected more (more abs and chest combinations and practice for drum solos) because I actually know figure 8s and camels well.",1441152000,11,1126,4.3619047619047615

6822055,5,B00PUSXX56,Love it!!..easy to follow and fun,1436832000,,33,4.666666666666667
6822056,5,B00PUSXX56,"Friendly tone, clear instructions, lots to unpack and practice.  Very refreshing in that it is not strictly for beginners.  If you're intermediate, you can really dig in.",1435622400,4,170,5.2592592592592595
6822057,5,B00PUSXX56,"What a workout!  Prepare to sweat and be sore the next day.  Shahrzad does a great job explaining which muscles are used to execute the moves and how you can strengthen them.  I enjoyed this the first time through, and know that it will be a vital part of my dance DVD library!",1434672000,7,277,4.188679245283019
6822058,3,B00PUSXX56,I love the way she moves! She has incredible technique but I wish she had covered more. What I found most helpful were the drills on using stomach muscles to do moves I already know in an interesting new way ( for example I use legs to perform mayas but now I can practice them using the stomach.) But I wish she had covered more advanced material too such as flutters or the way she can do a chest-lift type shimmy using her stomach. If she came out with a more advanced dvd on anything I would buy it but this dvd is only about an hour and it isn't too hard.,1433376000,17,560,4.008928571428571
6822059,5,B00PUSXX56,"I bought this dvd after watching the preview on Youtube. It is an excellent idea to make a dvd simply on belly & waist movements. The dvd has different sections, she spends enough time demonstrating  each essential movement with a live drummer.

Followed by an enjoyable performance.  I have to add that Shahrzad has wonderful figure that makes her dance moves appear distinct and rhythmical. I am completely satisfied",1420848000,14,503,5.197530864197531
8689341,3,B00PUSXX56,"This was recommended by a former teacher, so I suppose I am missing something. A skill like Shahrzad has takes years to master, unless you are born with a unique gift, and cannot be learned from a DVD, in my opinion. But this DVD will show you a way to get there.",1522713600,,263,4.076923076923077
8689342,5,B00PUSXX56,Shahrad is a wonderful belly dancer and teacher.,1508630400,,48,5.125
8689343,5,B00PUSXX56,Very easy to follow and has helped me in my quest for more belly control in my dance,1499299200,,84,3.7222222222222223
8689344,5,B00PUSXX56,Phenomonal DVD.  Thank you.,1486252800,,27,5.75
8689345,4,B00PUSXX56,"I am so pleased to see this DVD, which is the first instructional video she has produced.  Instructions are clear and simple.  It is suitable for both beginner and advanced student, especially those dance students who wish to fully master basics by delving slowly and deeply into the moves.  Not to be underestimated.",1481932800,,317,4.943396226415095
8689346,2,B00PUSXX56,"She does not explain all she does dancing. Only remeted to easy and very stupid movements and combinations. I expected much more from this dvd acorde with the trailer showing her dancing. I will wait for the advanced dvd. She dances very well but it seems to me she does not want to explain everything of her technique. I found so short class.
It's very easy to follow her at the instructions but as the movements are not for beginers why does she not explained all she does?
I have brought lots of dvds of Sadie and when you finish taking Sadie's class you feel she has teached generously all she can transmit by a video dvd.
Shahrzad  showed at the end a performance that has a lot a lot of combinations and abdominal isolations she didn't teached for example, only some basics movements. No more.
So I feel it has  very good explanations but for stupid  isolations and combinations",1480464000,,884,4.5125
8689347,5,B00PUSXX56,Perfect workout and learning super fast delivery too,1472342400,,52,5.625
8689348,5,B00PUSXX56,"Since stomach isolations are such a big part of belly dance,  I wanted to dig in on that aspect. This video is perfect. I'm actually finding my upper abs, yay! It's fun to have a drummer playing the music, and it doesn't hurt that he's both talented and handsome. This is one of my favorite belly dance instructional dvd's. You can put it on and just drill. It's fun and effective.",1451952000,5,381,4.366197183098592
8689349,5,B00PUSXX56,Love the isolation exercises she has you do.  Great stuff.,1451692800,,58,4.8
8689350,4,B00PUSXX56,I really like her layers and I loved watching her break them down. Good Video.,1450051200,,78,4.266666666666667
