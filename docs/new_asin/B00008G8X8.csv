Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1291420800,,615,4.811320754716981
7983749,3,B00008G8X8,"The same old recycled ""public domain"" episodes of THE LUCY SHOW...  Just about every single budget-line DVD company you can think of has trundled out these shows.  Serious ""Lucy"" fans have probably purchased the episodes over and over again, but for new viewers looking to introduce themselves to the hilarity of Lucy's world, this is a good place to start.

Five years after the last episode of ""I Love Lucy"" aired, Lucille Ball was back at CBS, sans Desi Arnaz (whom she had divorced by this point) for another shot at sitcom success. THE LUCY SHOW cast Ball as Lucille Carmichael, a widow who lived with her best friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and their respective children in a large house in upstate New York. The show was later re-tooled, with Lucy moving to California to work as a secretary for bank manager Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).

Episodes:

""Lucy and Paul Winchell"" - Lucy must transform into a life-sized puppet when ventriloquist Paul Winchell entertains at the annual bank gala.

""Lucy Gets Caught in the Draft"" - Lucy is trapped whilst delivering papers to Mr. Mooney during his army training.

""Lucy Flies to London"" - After winning a dog-food jingle contest, Lucy jets off to Europe, but first she must sit through a connecting flight to New York...with Mooney as her nervous seat partner.

""Lucy and Pat Collins"" - When he compains of chronic insomnia, Lucy takes Mr. Mooney to a performance of ""Hip Hypnotist"" Miss Pat.

""Little Old Lady Lucy"" - Lucy masquerades as an elderly millionairess in order to attract a hefty new account for the bank.

""Viv Visits Lucy"" - Lucy and Viv go undercover as hippies on the Sunset Strip after learning that one of their friends' sons has ""gone native"".

""Lucy Meets Tennessee Ernie Ford"" - One of the many shows featuring Lucy's old friend; he also appeared in several ""I Love Lucy"" episodes, and the later ""Here's Lucy"".",1283472000,,1884,4.783950617283951
