8576947,5,B00C374P0O,It was a gift for my 16 year old autistic godson who is very into the older 'classic' cartoons. He loved it.,1428624000,,108,3.9545454545454546
8576948,1,B00C374P0O,"I agree that the way the Smurfs cartoons are being released is a complete joke.  I would buy every volume they release, but I am not going to buy these.  I wouldn't mind paying a slightly higher price to get the volumes if the company that puts them out would stop being so greedy.",1375401600,3,281,4.185185185185185
8576949,4,B00C374P0O,"I adored The Smurfs as a child and I couldn't wait to show my kids The Smurfs: Smurfs to the Rescue!

We sat down together and watched the first episode The Goblin of Boulder Woods. Unfortunately, my kids weren't into this one at all. They were at first when the Smurfs were on but then it became more of Pee Wee's story being told and so the Smurfs were only at the beginning and the end of this episode.

The rest of the episodes, however, starred the Smurfs; as they should! My kids loved these adorable blue characters as I'd hoped they would. It brings back so much of my childhood to watch these shows.

It's funny how spoiled by technology my kids are. The sound is just the same as it was on the original episodes. I could almost see my parents huge old TV we had as a kid. My kids asked me what was wrong with the sound but it didn't stop them from enjoying the rest of the DVD. I was surprised that the sound wasn't better but at the same time, it added to the authenticity of these original episodes.

The Smurfs are wholesome characters who love each other and work well together which is something I'm constantly trying to teach my kids. We will all enjoy The Smurfs: Smurfs to the Rescue many times over I'm sure!",1373932800,,1227,4.253218884120171
8576950,1,B00C374P0O,"I love the Smurfs and have many VHS tapes of them.  I want to get them on DVD, but the way WB is releasing them is beyond ridiculous.  This DVD has only 6 episodes and one of them, Sideshow Smurfs, was already released on the ""Season One-Volume 2"" DVD.  This is completely frustrating.  I would think they'd make more money if they'd release the Smurfs in Season Box Sets for a reasonable price.  As Die-hard a fan as I am, being this fed up and not likely to buy another one, says a lot.",1369267200,8,488,4.148936170212766
8576951,1,B00C374P0O,"You get a whole ""6"" (that is SIX) episodes of Smurfs! It maybe from Season 2 or maybe 3? They maybe out of order as the rest of the cheap WB releases are!

Stop wasting your time + money with these cheap WB $5 DVDs with a few episodes and just buy the complete Seasons 1-6 sets from Amazon UK, PAL is better quality then NTSC anyway (576 vs. 480).

Video Res 101 for those of you who don't know:

480 = NTSC (or SD here)
576 = PAL
720 = HD
1080 = HD

So if PAL is better, why wait for lower quality sets to come here? 99% of the time it's because you THINK you can't play them, but you can esp. with newer HD TVs.

All you need is a PC/MAC or if you prefer TV then pickup a region free player like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SAMSUNG-UP-CONVERT-DVD-PLAYER-REGION-FREE-DVD-PLAYER-CODE-FREE-DVD-PLAYER-ALL-REGION-DVD-PLAYER-REGION-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0/dp/B0067QX2B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SAMSUNG UP-CONVERT DVD PLAYER - REGION FREE DVD PLAYER, CODE FREE DVD PLAYER, ALL REGION DVD PLAYER, REGION 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0</a>

WB are bunch of idiots, they release Smurfs on cheap dvd sets and as crappy digital downloads crippled with DRM - just go PAL! To hell with them!",1368921600,12,1215,5.173469387755102
8576952,1,B00C374P0O,"Warner Bros keeps releasing these single dvds of the smurfs and no more season sets. It will take forever to release the whole series this way, if you look on Amazon UK,  Fabulous Films are releasing season sets, whole seasons! WB many times looks to make the fast buck, collectors should stay far away from these dvds, they're for very casual fans of the series and the price is not even that low! WB the company who can't even get around to releasing Scooby and Scrappy Doo show, just turn over your releases to WAC or a company who would release the whole series of classic cartoons!

*Update June 20, 2013.

To further illustrate the point above, WB has just announced another single Smurfs dvd ""The Smurfs - 'Smurftastic Journey "" due out October 15th 2013 with 4 episodes, FOUR EPISODES!! As Charlie Brown would say, Good Grief! "" WB just don't get it and apparently have not got it regarding retro cartoons for awhile now. I would say true Smurf fans should boycott these releases and let WB know we want season sets like other regions have got and are getting. Though on Twitter WB hardly ever answers a single question but at least we could all send them tweets telling them stop with the single dvd releases!!",1367625600,9,1219,4.557077625570776
