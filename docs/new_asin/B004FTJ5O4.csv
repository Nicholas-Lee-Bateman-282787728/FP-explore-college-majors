4371003,4,B004FTJ5O4,"Good general overview and helpful to watch someone doing it in front of you. Includes a lot of detail, however I learned just as much watching YouTube and for free. Kind of expensive, hence four stars. Overall very useful though.",1300838400,2,229,4.75
4371004,5,B004FTJ5O4,"Finally a decent reloading dvd that isn't just an add put together in the 1980's by a reloading company, and then transfered to a DVD from a low quality VHS! I wish more shooting videos would be done like this! Widescreen close up shots are really nice and make the instructions easy to follow. Definately for beginners though - but if you don't really know anything about reloading, this video will get you making ammunition quick.",1292284800,8,432,4.697368421052632

8428296,4,B004FTJ5O4,"I am a complete beginner to reloading but find I have to if I am to afford enough ammo to properly train with prices on rounds being what they are. I was very pleased as this video very simply walks you through the basics of pistol and rifle loading. Sure it is a bit of an ad for Lee, but I don't see the other companies doing as good a job of getting folks interested in reloading. Already ordered some of Lee's products because I know exactly what I will be looking at thanks to the video. It doesn't hurt that their product reviews are all pretty good. My only complaint on the video is that it would be nice if they demonstrated some of the more advanced components such as powder feeds.",1360368000,3,692,4.2105263157894735
8428297,1,B004FTJ5O4,"I am VERY new to reloading so I thought I couldn't go wrong with this video. I have been reading online and watching youtube. There was absolutely nothing in this DVD that I didn't already know just by reading some basic information online. Didn't give you info on things like case trimming, how to reference the reloading manual, and other important pieces of information.  This video was VERY low budget production and WAY worse than most youtube videos. The camera was so low quality that you couldn't see important details like how to read the scale. Used the cheapest equipment possible. The whole video looks like it cost $100 to produce. Cheap little single stage press screwed to a plywood table with sheetrock screws. Even showed cleaning the  brass on a stove in boiling soapy water! Who does that? Didn't use reloading trays and show a real ""process"" of reloading.  A real waste of time watching and money. Do yourself a favor and get a good book and watch Youtube videos on reloading basics..",1358812800,5,1004,4.758620689655173
