8059828,4,B0009E27QM,"Being a fan of mob-type movies I found the plot of Beyond Recognition intriguing.  A world reknowned plastic surgeon is called upon to make a ""client"" unrecognizable. It is when he refuses the real fun begins. Explosive and, sometimes, terrifying suspense thriller. Very entertaining.",1291939200,,284,5.454545454545454
8059829,4,B0009E27QM,"Don't watch this flick if you're after a high body-count or wall to wall fight scenes. There's not a lot of action at all for that matter, except in the opening and again at the very end.  I think one of the problems is the way this film was marketed. They made it look like an action flick when it's more about atmosphere than action.  It moves at a leisurely pace and has an art-house sensibility.  The story is actually quite intriguing, a surgeon pursued by mobsters he refuses to operate on.  It keeps you guessing and has some nicely directed surprises, like the body in the trunk and the ""fbi agent"" reveal.  Jimmie Jones isn't particularly good and I think the movie would have benefited from a stronger lead, but some of the supporting actors make up for it, especially Aimee Denaro as the ditzy assistant. On the positive side, the music is atmospheric and haunting, especially the closing track.  And for a low budget digital production it looks fantastic -- the shots of the Italian Alps and the nighttime exteriors have the production value of a big budget flick.  All in all, I'd say it's an atmospheric watch, especially for those who like northern Italy and the alps.  A kind of sitting back on the sofa on a Sunday afternoon film.",1141689600,,1247,4.560538116591928
8059830,1,B0009E27QM,"This really bad movie is filled with so much dead space and unnecessary scenes it's like eating a tofu burger.  And about as appetizing.

The ridiculous storyline has a noted arrogant plastic surgeon approached by a couple of seedy guys to perform face reformation of a noted crime boss in Italy.  He refuses so they at first attempt to kidnap him, but when he manages to escape, they frame him for the murder of the girl who supposedly drugged him.  Then the FBI asks the doc to help them out by going along with the surgery so they can catch this crime boss.  Sound exciting?  Well, it isn't.  There are scenes of such lethargy one has to pinch oneself to stay awake, e.g, the director takes his time to show us the handsome if unlikeable doc getting ready for work, driving to work, and even replacing a band-aid, with no adherence to the plot at all.  Jimmie Jones and Deborah Martin have to be two of the worst actors I've seen in some time, and the editing, music and direction are flatulent to say the least.  Avoid at all costs.",1140220800,,1036,4.410526315789474
