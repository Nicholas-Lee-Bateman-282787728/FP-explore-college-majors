3496453,1,B001BNFR7G,"I was really excited when i got this video thinking that it would really help me get my belly really flat. Not so. The exercices are no good. They are way too short and she jumps from one set of abs to another quickly and it just does not make any sense the way the work out is set up. I wasted my $15.00 at Target and unfortunately cannot take it back. I will never buy any of her products. Horrible....Maybe it's good if you are a very very beginner - if you do not know anything about exercizing, but for us who are a bit advanced, this video is of no use whatsoever.",1231372800,7,570,4.008771929824562
3496454,5,B001BNFR7G,"This is the #1 ab video I have ever purchased.  Denise has every ab move possible on this dvd including, yoga & pilates.

The workout leaves me feeling accomplished and I'm already seeing results after a week and a half.  I like the several choices of routines offered to switch it up.

3496476,4,B001BNFR7G,I like having 7 different workouts to choose from so that I can focus on a different one each day or start with the first one and gradually work through the others as I become physically able.  I also like how short they are.  Anyone can do ab exercises for 10 minutes.,1424736000,2,269,4.153846153846154

3496484,4,B001BNFR7G,"I bought this DVD to replace the one I lost. My favorite workout is the first one, Personal Training System. All seven workouts are designed for the abs and are either 10 to 15 minutes long. I just did Get Fit Fast and noticed some new moves from Denise, involving crossing the legs while on your back and working the lower abs, which I think was very effective. As usual, Denise gives a running commentary, involving naming the muscles being worked, mixed with positive remarks to encourage the ""worker"" (me). There are more women in this video--I didn't count, but I think there were 6, and that was a little distracting. I don't care for Pilates so haven't done them yet and plan to do the yoga body burn next. the Hit the Spot Core Complete requires a stability ball which I don't have so haven't done that one. A word of caution; the first 4 workouts are on the main menu, but to get to the second 3, you need to go to More Workouts. I always feel energized after Denise workouts so gave this a 4 Star review.",1418860800,8,1014,4.342105263157895

3496488,4,B001BNFR7G,Good cd from denise.  Some of the moves however are too advanced for me but I do try. I like her enthusiasm and skills but she moves quickly from excercise to excercise and you need to keep up with her.,1411689600,,202,4.05
3496489,5,B001BNFR7G,"Four years ago I bought this copy for the first time at WalMart after New Years.  When I recently scratched that copy in a mishap, my life was ruined.  I missed it very much and bought another copy recently here on Amazon.  I hope, in 20 years, I will still be doing double crunches to this DVD.  I can't help but love Denise - some people are a natural ""upper.""",1411603200,2,362,4.128571428571429

3496493,5,B001BNFR7G,I was a bit disappointed in this.  It really is just a bunch of different ends to old video's so I am not impressed.  I like Denise Austin as a whole but this was not a good buy.,1407456000,,178,3.6578947368421053
3496494,4,B001BNFR7G,"Great 10 min abs with lots of variety, different levels of difficulty and good instruction. Several different workouts to choose from so you don't get bored.

3496496,1,B001BNFR7G,The reviews said this was fairly easy but it is not. I have a bad rotator cuff and this bothers my shoulder by supporting my whole body with one arm only. You can only do this if you already have great abs.,1402617600,,206,3.9285714285714284
3496497,4,B001BNFR7G,Denise Austin is amazing.  She always comes up with creative doable exercises.  She is ahead of me in her fitness and so I strive to do better and her instructions are very insightful.  She always remembers to say hold in your belly;.,1399075200,2,234,4.523809523809524

3496500,3,B001BNFR7G,"I would not have purchased this if there was a warning  about back problems. I cannot do many of the routines due to cracked vertebrae, but the workout looks great otherwise. My fault.",1394323200,,184,4.575757575757576

3496503,3,B001BNFR7G,didn't realize that this was all floor work.  I generally don't like all floor work tapes.  I would not have purchased it if I knew.,1391385600,,132,4.24
3496504,4,B001BNFR7G,"The video is as it is advertised, offering 7 different belly exercises.  I think it is best designed to do separately after other workouts.  I guess that is what I don't like about it.  I usually like her videos that are a complete workout and I don't like to change tapes during a workout.  The other disappointing factor is that all of these workouts are from previous videos.  It may have indicated that in description but I missed that if it did.  Since I have many of Denise's videos, I already have several of these sessions.  The actual sessions are excellent and if you are inclined, doing all of them would certainly strengthen your core!  For me, it would not only be too much of a good thing but I would be bored.",1390867200,,724,4.390977443609023

3496508,3,B001BNFR7G,"Its  certainly different than what im used to but to be honest, it beats doing a zillion sit ups  Im going to stick with it and see what happens.  The day after burn is always a good sign",1383955200,,187,3.8684210526315788
3496509,5,B001BNFR7G,If you stick to it you will not only notice results immediately but you will keep the belly fat away.,1382313600,,101,4.1

3496511,4,B001BNFR7G,"i like it, you can chose your own routine, its all very easy and simple to follow, but man she talks constantly and not about the moves..haha. More or less, its good for beginners and you get the option mute her or listen to her talk non-stop. your choice. Nice set up",1378857600,2,268,4.173076923076923
3496512,5,B001BNFR7G,I really liked this Denise Austin workout because it concentrates on the stomach area while trying to get a flatter stomach.,1378166400,,124,4.9523809523809526

3496518,4,B001BNFR7G,"Very good workout for your core and abs.  What I disliked about it is I am in my 50's and my wrist and knees are not as strong as they used to be, so it is difficult for me to do some the pilates positions.  I have been excercising for years so I am able to modify some of the moves, and Denise should have shown modified position for some of the pilates positions that some people may not be able to do.  I would recommend this to most people who want to flatter abs and a trim waist line.",1363737600,,490,3.88
3496519,4,B001BNFR7G,"I am very pleased with the product. It is easy to follow, you don't need a lot of space to work out, and it has been effective. It looks easy at first, but Ms. Austin works the muscles slowly and controlled - you feel it! It also gives you options and levels to work with - I like the choices. My daughters, who are gymnasts, started using it when they saw me doing it - in order to keep toned. (They are teens, and actually enjoy it!)",1361059200,,435,4.011494252873563

3496522,2,B001BNFR7G,"This was not a typical Denise Austin workout video (and I would know, I've done most everything she has put out since the early 90's) moves are repetitive, - your up, your down, your in every position and nothing flows. I got so tired of T-stand I just stopped doing it. Since opened videos are non-returnable, this one will go in my yardsale pile.",1356825600,,348,4.453125
3496523,4,B001BNFR7G,"I bought this video thinking great a DVD that has all ""new"" ab workouts in one place. I was disappointed to know that all these 7 workouts are on her other DVDs. Its nice to have them in one place but I own all the other DVDs so it kind of a waste of money. I admit that I do pull this one out as its convenient instead of finding which one I want to do.

If you don't really have any Denise Austins videos this is a great DVD as it has some great workouts on it. Denise Austin is great instructor. Very personable and friendly. She is always smiling and makes the workouts fun.",1353974400,,578,3.9827586206896552

3496526,3,B001BNFR7G,"I like the belly blasters that she recommended,But I feel like their were some scenes where she was repeating the same routine, plus it's broken down in sections (which I didn't like) because you have to keep pressing play every time one scene goes off, I also feel like the exercise routines are really quick (as if I know the routine by hard)her steps were really fast.

I workout three times a week alternating dvd`s . I start with shrink your female fat zone (best warmup and workout ever for us women) then I add the Buns and thight workout DVD then I change it up  with Kickboxing and pilates DVD. I now have ""best looking buns"" as Denise likes to say to encurage and very firm arms in less than three months workouts with her DVD`s. I am working on my abs DVD now , I just received the DVD and I can already tell she has all the moves invented for ABS and she really cares about your back. Never had back pain after any of her workouts. I seriously raccomend Denise if you are serious about getting in shape ;-)",1336953600,,882,4.068965517241379

It's nice to have a different routine for every day of the week, and you can definitely feel it afterwards. I would much rather use this video than do endless amounts of crunches that don't seem to do anything. I usually do one routine every day, in addition to cardio 3-5 times a week.

I've used her videos before, and though some people think her words of encouragement go a little overboard, I think it's amusing!",1325635200,,508,4.347368421052631

They include pilates, yoga, and traditional ab work.)",1312761600,,336,4.435483870967742

I do at least one of the workouts every day before work and feel like I am getting something accomplished even if I don't have time for a full workout.

3496536,5,B001BNFR7G,"LOVE THIS DVD!!! This is everything I hoped it would be and more! The workouts are slow and controlled yet challenging enough but not exhausting. I can feel the workout in my tummy muscles when I'm done, and have noticed a huge difference in my tummy strength and appearance. Doing these exercises several times per week has returned my post pregnancy (separated) tummy muscles to a tight and supportive condition. I am soooo thankful that I purchased this! Denise Austin teaches a specific and very effective exercise in one of the segments that tightens the tummy muscles that become weak during pregnancy, That's exactly what I needed! I look forward to this workout every day since I started using this DVD. Denise Austin is professional and fun!! I would recommend to everyone. I would also recommend another of her workout DVD's that I love and use often called ""Pilates For Every Body."" These are some of the BEST!",1303948800,29,921,4.8354430379746836
3496537,5,B001BNFR7G,"I work out a couple times a week, including the Ab machines at the gym, but was not seeing any results with my stomach - which is where I carry most of my weight. I never thought I could have definition in my abs again, but with this DVD I feel well on my way!

I thought this DVD really delivered for somebody who is a beginner and wants results without spending too much time. It's easy to crawl out of bed and pop it in for 10 minutes in the morning before work - so easy that I'm able to stay consistent with doing it every day! Because it's easy to stay committed, I am seeing really great results after only 2 weeks! I would definitely recommend doing it in the morning too, because then you are more aware of trying to flex the muscles during the day by sitting up straight.

If you are a big Jillian Michaels fan, than this DVD is probably not tough enough for you - but if you are more of a beginner and need some daily motivation and different exercises to work all the different muscles in your abs, than this DVD is perfect for you!",1298937600,41,1044,4.112745098039215
3496538,4,B001BNFR7G,"I have a few Denise Austin and bought this one for stomach-targeting; she is extremely professional, and has a good assortment of 7 different, 10 minute workouts. The best thing about it is the Custom Workout option; you can pick different workouts, and mix up your exercise routine each time you do it.

Denise Austin, I think, is an excellent instructor, if you're new to her and want a good motivator: she herself has been studying fitness and physical education for over 25 years, has had exercise TV shows, but is also a mother of 2 and is now over 50! She is also in the U.S. President's Fitness something-or-other, so she seems pretty well respected in her field.

I must say though - if you want results, you will have to bust it a bit! The exercises are tough, and I do x3 per session, so 30 minutes of belly exercises is pretty darn tiring! But the exercises are challenging without being impossible, she gives ""Level 1, 2, and 3"" so you can progress and start at a lower level, and she has some different stuff on here: aerobic exercises, sit-ups, pilates, and yoga. You will need a yoga mat, especially on a hard floor (or just keep a cushion on hand for under your elbows and knees), and for the final workout you'll need an exercise ball too.

The downside for any Denise-fans is that you probably have some of these workouts already; they're all taken from other workout videos (i.e. she's taken the stomach-targeting parts from her other DVDs and compiled them here). Also, I have read some people find her peppy ""encouraging voice"" a bit annoying, but never fear, there is also another option to have music instead of Denise's instructions!

I have had this DVD for about 3 months, and am definitely seeing results, so you can definitely do it!! But the problem is that you will have to be prepared for some tough exercises...",1286409600,17,1843,4.575757575757576
3496539,4,B001BNFR7G,The short sessions in this DVD make it fit right into my busy schedule.  She does a good job explaining and demonstrating each move.,1285891200,,132,4.5
3496540,4,B001BNFR7G,I would like to know whether this dvd is good enough for somebody who has a weak neck. I purchased the 10 min solution belly fat blaster from suzanne bowen and only after i have been doing it for a couple of weeks that i realised that how much pressure it puts to the neck especially when you do the pilates and abs ripper sections. I am now on the way to buy some other dvd which still targets the lower as well as mid belly fat but not by putting any strain on the neck any help would be greatly appreciated.

I really enjoy the 10-15 min. workouts because they aren't so long that I get bored with them, but I also work out enough to feel the burn. I usually add these to some treadmill running or another workout dvd. I'm satisfied with my purchase and anyone that's looking for some short exercises for daily workouts, this is perfect to work your abs!",1266537600,2,396,4.438356164383562
3496544,3,B001BNFR7G,although I liked all of the workouts I did not realize it was a repeat of several old DVD's all put together for the abs.  I already had these same workouts on previously purchased DVDs and did not see anything new.,1260057600,2,215,4.2439024390243905
3496545,2,B001BNFR7G,"I purchased this DVD looking for variety of Abs workout, I was very dissapointed!

The different segments are not actually different they are mostly the same excersizes but with different atmosphere and background !

I was surprised as to how commercial this DVD is! The actual duration I would say is maybe 15 minuites in total, all excersizes are repeated.

I do not recommend this DVD. It's no value for money.",1250899200,3,413,4.788732394366197

The routines were easy enough, but seemed to be rushed together with minimal repetitions... to the point that I did not feel like I got a thorough workout.

Would have been good as a rental DVD to pawn ideas from, but not a good purchase all around.",1243814400,,422,4.767123287671233

3496550,3,B001BNFR7G,"Okay, I'll admit. I'm a complete stranger to these ab workouts- which is why for the first several times I use it, I need the volume up so I can hear the instruction. Well, there's a little problem with that. She needs to lay off the caffiene! These are great workouts for a beginner, and I have seen results- BUT I cannot stomach her overly peppy voice. Instead of feeling pumped like after my cardio and strength training, I get up off the mat just feeling really annoyed. I think I need to find another DVD.",1242950400,2,510,4.322916666666667
3496551,1,B001BNFR7G,I have purchased many of Denise Austin's older videos and have been very pleased but this video is by far the worst.

Try mixing it up. I gurantee you'll see results.",1232582400,32,426,4.618421052631579
