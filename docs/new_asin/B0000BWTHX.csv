7998048,1,B0000BWTHX,I have this and I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in it.  ALL  the pictures are very blury.  Almost as if they did it on purpose.  It gave me a headach and the music was far from relaxing.  I guess Jazzy should have warned me.  Anyway I really don't like it and would never buy another from this company.,1160352000,5,293,4.052631578947368
