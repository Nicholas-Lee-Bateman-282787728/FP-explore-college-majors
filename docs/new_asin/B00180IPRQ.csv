Keaton is also the narrator and does a very good job of explaining the Bio-mechanics of how to move your body to get the hoop to do what is desired. It lost a star for video quality and sound quality. aspect ratio is 4:3 (no biggy) but the resolution was either an interpolated HD, or simply below 72ppi (standard screen resolution) as pixelation occurs from the beginning and you can hear the narration microphone cut in and out very easily (no sound enveloping).

Still buy. Hoopnotica has some of the best instructions I've found on hooping. You're moving around while doing it so the slightly poor video quality is only noticed 1/100th of the time spent watching it as you're moving around.",1384387200,,738,4.676923076923077

I can't wait to share what I've learned with my students at our Mon Valley YMCA.",1364256000,,159,4.333333333333333
8268057,2,B00180IPRQ,"I'm a good hoola hooper, but when it comes to the super advanced stuff that they are doing..NO WAY! Popped it into my dvd player once, I don't even know where it is now. I was so hard!",1304726400,,184,3.8684210526315788
8268058,4,B00180IPRQ,"They aren't entirely clear this isn't a linear follow up to the first DVD in the ""Series"" which is focused on technique and movement. This one is more of a straight up workout dvd that is presented over 3 levels depending on your own fitness level. It's not bad and I do hope the series comes back.",1255651200,5,298,4.245614035087719
8268059,5,B00180IPRQ,"I recently purchased both Hoopnotica Beginner Levels 1 and 2.  I am new to hoop dancing and I watched both of these DVDs from beginning to end without hooping just to concentrate on the instructions.  I think they are both excellent DVDs as they are very clear, organized and concise. If you are trying to decide on which one to get, I recommend that you start with the Level 1, but really you should get both.  I plan to collect these as they come out, they are really that good.  (Note that these aren't exercise routine DVDs - they are for learning the techniques of hoop dancing.)",1247788800,8,584,4.429906542056075
8268060,5,B00180IPRQ,I really enjoy these DVDs. The instruction is very straight forward and easy to follow. I would absolutely recommend this for beginning hoop dancers!,1237766400,2,149,5.25
8268061,5,B00180IPRQ,"I know how to do a basic hula hoop around the waist and am looking for a DVD that I can get some exercise and burn some calories with.

For anyone who might have viewed both Hoopnotica Beginner Level 1 and Hoopnotica Beginner Level 2 -- would you suggest I get 1 or 2 for my purpose?

Thanks.",1226707200,2,292,4.017241379310345
