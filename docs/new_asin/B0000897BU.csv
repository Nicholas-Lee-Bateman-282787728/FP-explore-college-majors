7980580,3,B0000897BU,I remember about 5 years ago I went over to a friends house.. She asked me if I liked Cradle of Filth.. At the time I had no clue who they were.. They were still underground at the time.. So we watched the VHS of PanDaemonAeon & ever since then I was hooked. Since then I've gotten every cd by them and I'm currently working on collecting the DVDs as well.,1168387200,,356,4.028169014084507
7980581,5,B0000897BU,"Let me say, this is an excellent dvd.  From the cradle to enslave is a good music video and the ""making of"" part is really funny.  The concert footage is not as good as the footage on Heavey left-handed and candid, but Dani's little intro's before each song are rather funny so id recommend it to any CoF fan.",1126137600,,309,4.220338983050848
7980582,5,B0000897BU,"Cradle of Filth- one of the absolute best bands of today (the others being Dimmu Borgir, Arch Enemy, Opeth, and old In Flames) Another black gem from the twisted corpse that is Dani Filth.  This dvd was hilarious, the music video was good (though not great; my favorite black metal music video is Dimmu Borgir- ""Progenies of the Great Apocalypse"") the making of was also funny and Cradle put on an awesome live show (come back to Atlanta, CoF! I missed your November show!) All in all, well worth the money for fans of the band, of black metal, or of Satan in general...VwV",1112659200,,573,4.509615384615385
7980583,5,B0000897BU,"If you are a Cradle Of Filth fan , you simply MUST have this DVD!!!! The Un-cut version of ""From The Cradle To Enslave"" IS FANTASTIC!!! Directed by Alex Chandon (""Cradle Of Fear"") film Director, this really is what Cradle Of Filth Is truely about!! The Live performances are Fantastic!! (They really put on a Terrific show!!) I highly recommend this DVD to all C.O.F. fans, If you are new to this band this is a excellent way to see them in all their glory!!Also make sure to check out the ""Heavy Left Handed and Candid"" DVD. Together the two DVD's Make for an excellent night of PURE FILTH!! Fantastic Songs, Fantastic videos, and well worth the price!! Don't hesitate!! LONG LIVE FILTH and LONG LIVE METAL!!!",1107907200,5,710,4.5984251968503935
7980584,5,B0000897BU,If you haven't seen the uncut video for From the Cradle to Enslave...... slap yourself. This video could have been pieced together from clippings on the Hammer Horror cutting floor. Mix with a bunch of circus freaks and you have the genius that is the twisted mind of Danni Filth.,1106611200,2,280,4.62
7980585,5,B0000897BU,"This is the better of the two Cradle of Filth DVD's I've seen so far. (The other being Heavy Left-handed and Candid).  This has the best video they've made yet, ""From the Cradle to Enslave"".  It includes the regular version and the ""MTV"" version (HAHAHA), as well as the making of the video.  Then it has a lot of concert footage, which is awesome. They look like they put on a good show, I can't wait to see them in concert! This was also done before they REALLY sold out, which is a good thing because the music is better.  On it's own I'd probably give this a 4, but compared to Left handed and candid it gets a 5 ^_^",1071619200,2,620,4.099173553719008
