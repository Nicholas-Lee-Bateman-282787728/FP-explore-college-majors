8695609,4,B00RNTYHBO,"There are four approximently 30 minute programs devoted to one of each of the following: Paradise Lost, The Canterbury Tales, The Odyessey, and Beowulf.  Each of these programs would be right at home in a western literature or an English literature class at least from the secondary level and up.  Each program is edited to have short segments of interviews with experts, dramatic reenactments, still pictures with commentary, and the presenter talking to camera.  These programs were produced by Cromwell Productions, Ltd. in 1998 and 1999.  Over the years the list of distributors has grown.  This list includes Kultur Video, Eagle Rock Entertainment Ltd., and lately Bay View Entertainment.  There is another distributor that caters to the educational institution market that offers each of these same titles individually with public performance rights.",1426809600,5,856,5.446969696969697
