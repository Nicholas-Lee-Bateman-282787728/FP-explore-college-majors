8689010,5,B003D7L7Q8,"I found this course very useful-I am relatively new to VMWare Administration (I've built VMs in past lives, but never really focused on the entire administrative architecture). Larry does a really nice job of keeping the course moving along, and there is very little extraneous material - each chapter serves a purpose, and is very well-focused and comprehensive.

I had a VMWare Infrastructure Client available to me as I was going through the training and I was able to follow along in my own environment. Being able to actually perform the tasks as I'm watching/learning something is the best way for me to retain the information I'm viewing.

If I had one critique as a new VMWare user, it would be with the order of the chapters. For experienced VMWare Admins, however, I can see why the chapters are ordered as they are, and for those users, the order makes perfect sense. For a new user without much background, the What's New chapter and the Upgrade chapters could be reviewed after you've viewed the other chapters.",1285545600,,1024,4.8125
