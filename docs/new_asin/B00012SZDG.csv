1968471,1,B00012SZDG,Ordered this DVD in Sept and it arrived in November as a gift for Christmas for my husband. After Christmas we find out we can't play it. It cannot be played in the US. You need a special player which was not mentioned when I purchased the item. Knowing that it was being purchased for viewing in the US nothing was said by the exporter (third party) They refuse to allow me to return the item. I can't view so a review of the item is impossible. Never again!,1357084800,2,459,4.168539325842697

1968506,5,B00012SZDG,"I remember seeing this when it originally aired.  To a teenager from a small midwestern town, this was a first glimpse into Japan.  To have Toshiro Mifune, perhaps the greatest Japanese actor of his generation, along with Yoko Shimada and Richard Chamberlain in the same miniseries was beyond fantastic.  By more recent standards, the production may appear dated and rather trite, but it MUST be put into context of the times.  The miniseries was a recent innovation in TV, and this adaptation stayed very close to Clavell's masterpiece as well as providing Americans with their first glimpse of the rigidity of life in Japan during its most xenophobic period.  As I read the story of Will Adams, the English/Dutch trader upon whose story the novel and later miniseries were based, the value of this miniseries being shot entirely in Japan just opened the imaginations of a generation of us who were no longer content to be stuck to small towns in dying rust-belt America.

Say what you will about the production itself, and much has been said mostly by idiots who cling to pretentious ideas of what the series should have been in their blinded missives, but this production and the resulting popularity of Japanese culture after the miniseries ended prompted increased interest in life beyond the US for so many of us.",1469836800,,1319,4.8923766816143495

1968512,4,B00012SZDG,"It had been since the 1970s that I saw this TV mini series and watching it again was almost like seeing it for the first time. I vaguely recalled a few incidents but not much of the story. Of course, the book is always way better than the video, but this gave me over 9 hours of entertainment when there is not much else to watch on TV. The one thing that I found irritating is there is a lot of dialog in Japanese. They do not have subtitles for the Japanese conversation although they usually tell you what was said, but not always. The video quality is pretty good even though the size is for the older TV ( think 4:3). That doesn't bother me if something is worth watching but it is too bad they didn't film it in 16:9.",1465084800,2,723,4.098591549295775

1968539,2,B00012SZDG,"I've watched that series probably 10/15 times since the early 80's when it first came to television.
I've watched it again on DVD and Netflix, and decided to buy that bluray when I saw it.
The show is indeniably a 5-stars show but my review is about the bluray product.

Here is why I'm leaving only 2 stars:
- quality of the transfer to bluray. Who sells you a bluray somewhat assures you of its HD quality. So I was expecting at least a 720p quality transfer. The bluray claims an incredible quality at 1080p. On my 65"" plasma, I can see the lines of the old NTSC version which is basically around 525p. The producer basically reprocessed the images for 1080p, which is basically the same as tapping the '2x' button of an app on an iPad to fit the screen size. Seeing lines on the screen is not just ugly, it's often diverting one's attention from the movie. That alone should be noted as enough to have this product removed.
- a 4:3 transfer. Really? Ok so basically 16:9 didn't exist in the mid 80s, but couldn't the production company put more efforts and research the initial footage to see what could be possibly transferred to 16:9?! So again, on a 16:9 65"" TV a 4:3 program doesn't just look ugly, it looks anachronistic.
- extras: that's the second reason we buy  a bluray (the first one being HD quality and sound). The extras are not just poor in content, they're also super short like small featurettes. It really feels like the producer didn't invest much time or money to create a decent bluray, but instead used recycled material and repackaged the whole thing (including with a totally irrelevant front poster of a scene that never appears on screen).

A disgrace of an otherwise must-see show...",1440288000,4,1713,4.555194805194805
1968540,5,B00012SZDG,"The production quality of the Shogun miniseries is so good that now, 35 years later, it would be difficult to surpass.  The acting, sets and costumes are superb.  Anyone interested in Japan should not miss the opportunity to see this.  The bluray has no faults.  The director's and actor's commentary is very good and the commentary on the bluray appears to be the same as the one on the DVD.",1439856000,,392,4.557142857142857
1968541,5,B00012SZDG,"The blu-ray version of Shogun is a great improvement over previous versions (I've had VHS and DVD versions as well -- including VHS recordings from the original broadcast!).  I think the higher resolution added a lot, and prompted us to watch it again even though we've seen it numerous times.  It is not presented in widescreen format, but I think the image and colors are great.  The series is well done as always -- great locations and acting.  Maybe this will get my kids to watch it -- otherwise they just don't ""get"" much from the 1970-80s!!",1438819200,,547,4.608247422680412
1968542,4,B00012SZDG,"When this mini-series first aired on ABC back in 1980 it took the nation by storm. It consistently hit viewing numbers well over 20 million with other 30% of U.S. households glued to their televisions watching it during its five day run. It was a series like no other seen before or since, and still holds the distinction of being the only American television series completely filmed in Japan. The series broke barriers in both culture and controversy that networks are still hesitant to repeat. For me the series has a lot to love and a fair amount to not love. In spite of the imperfections Shogun is still a major landmark in television history.

Based on the book by James Clavell, Shogun is a 12 hour series that delves into the culture and intrigue of 16th century feudal Japan. It chronicles  the exploits of Pilot-Major John Blackthorne: a navigator for a Dutch cutter at war with the Portuguese. The ship runs aground in Japan, where he and the crew must survive the customs and ways of a people who are alien to them. Blackthorne gains favor with Lord Toranaga, a leading member of the Council of Regents, and quickly learns what it means to be Japanese both in language and customs. Blackthorne rises in the ranks and becomes involved in a forbidden love. All the while the political landscape of the region is falling to turmoil and threat of war. This is really a cursory  description of the plot and storylines of the series, as there are lots more going on.

What makes Shogun such a good series is the amazing attention to detail that was put in presenting the viewers what the world was like in this period of time in this country. And when I say they pay detail I mean it. The buildings, costumes, events, everything down to the tools and even methods of speech just scream the atmosphere of ancient Japan. The series is quick to show the brutality of medieval Japan, then takes the time to show the complexities of how the society works, and even why such harshness seems common. Watching this series is like taking a history and cultural studies class on the period.  You learn, just as Blackthorne does, about many details on customs and thinking back then. It's really a sneaky way to teach Americans about Japan, and it worked.

So much of the story is wrapped around learning the ways of what was considered a strange new world back then. However that doesn't mean all you get is a lesson in Japanese etiquette. You get spatterings of action, drama, romance and even a bit of comedy. For the most part this is a very well rounded story. I say for the most part because by the time to get to the final hours of the series (maybe the last 30%-40%) the pacing seems to slow to a crawl. Many times the series would draw out a particular action to build the dramatic tension, and by the time to get to this last portion those moments felt tedious. Then when you get to the end it's like they stopped the story abruptly and threw in some narrative to finish the series. It's almost as if the series lost a lot of its direction by that time and just plodded along without a strong purpose. I don't know if they ran out of time or if this was intentional. This is by no means enough to discount the show entirely, but be aware the pacing will change and a tiny few amount of questions will be left unanswered.

The acting in Shogun is another factor in making this series great. Along with the sets, costumes and other realistic details the actors gave you the sense you were genuinely there at the cusp of the year 1600. You get to see the talents of Richard Chamberlain at the height if his career and John Rhys-Davies at the start of his. You get to see legendary Japanese actors like Toshiro Mifune as Lord Toranaga. There are a lot of good performances from a lot of actors here. The music is also set well with the period with a slight bit of grandiose tone found in American westerns, even if it has a more Oriental style to it. The music was a bit of a distraction during incidental scenes as it was notably louder than the scenes with dialog.

I have seen both the original DVD release and this Blu-Ray, and I have to tell you the Blu-Ray is a massive improvement. The colors are much deeper in tone, making the DVD look washed and pale. The contrast and detail is a night and day difference. You still see the limitations of the source film like specks and debris as well as the good kind of things you get on a source film like that classic cinematic grain. All in all this is a wonderful transfer that brings new life to the presentation without removing the charm of the classic film format. Audio is cleaner, but to be honest making a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 from a mono audio source that wasn't that dynamic to begin with doesn't do the new high def format that much justice. Don't expect any great stereo and surround separation. For people like me they also offer Dolby Digital Mono, which is as true to the original source as you can get. Other audio options include Dolby Digital 2.0 in French, German and Japanese.

Shogun first aired in the United States in September 1980, and rebroadcast a couple times in an edited format. What you are getting here is the complete U.S. series that originally aired. That means none of the controversial footage was cut out like they were in the rebroadcasts. This also means you won't be getting absolutely everything. The series was such a hit it was released in Europe as a movie. The footage was obviously butchered for the allotted 125 minutes, and additional scenes of violence and nudity were added that didn't make the broadcast cut. None of those extra scenes are added, so this technically isn't the definitive edition (and none has ever existed).

The packaging is also different from the DVD release. Instead of five discs you have everything in three 50GB Blu-Ray discs. The BD release packaging isn't anywhere as pretty as the DVD with no impressive fold out graphic or anything. Plus the cover has almost nothing to do with the series (neither characters on packaging did any sword fighting as such). However while I prefer the DVD packaging you just get around the amazing high definition transfer, which makes me forgive all of the package design fumbles. The extras on his Blu-Ray set are exactly the same as the ones on the DVD release (and in the same standard definition). This is not really a bad thing, as there were a surprising amount of extras for a television show that aired over 30 years ago. Here's what you get:

The Making of Shgun  - This is by far the best feature on here. It's 13 chapters that you can see individually or all at once that runs almost an hour and a half. It covers so many different aspects about the making of Shogun you will walk away from this featurette with a whole new perspective. It's essentially interviews from cast and crew that were filmed for the 2003 DVD along with footage from the series. Rarely you would see a behind the scenes photograph of footage, however the vast amount of interesting information from the interviews alone is enough to make this a much desired addition.

Historical Perspective Featurettes - These are interviews with historians on three subjects pertaining to the series: the samurai, the tea ceremony and geishas. The first two are with University of Hawaii professor Dr. Paul Varley and the last with University of Hawaii associate professor Dr. Christine R. Yano. They are very dry commentaries that really feel disconnected to anything that truly pertains to the series. It's interesting information, but it comes off as irrelevant.

Select Scene Audio Commentary - Instead of a director commentary for the entire series (and I get it... who wants to talk through 12 hours of footage) what you have are very short commentaries on select scenes by Director Jerry London. His dialog is even dryer than the professors in the history perspective featurettes, and the information that gives in all but one scene is practically identical to what you get on The Making of Shogun. There are a couple of times when you get some additional information worth noting, and since the commentaries run 1-3 minutes approximately it doesn't hurt to listen. The one scene where London gives you absolutely new and fresh insights is Lord Buntaro Shoots Arrows. So if you only want the good stuff just jump forward to that scene.

Shogan is an epic series with all the grandeur that is implied. For me it didn't finish the way it should, but this series is an experience nonetheless. As a matter of fact this series may very well have launched America's fascination with Japan. Shogun Assassin (an edited release of two Lone Wolf and Cub movies) was the first samurai genre movie presented to the United States, and happened a few months after Shogun aired. Enter the Ninja was the first ninja genre film made in the United States, and it was released just a year after Shogun. It seems to me this series started a craze that lasted through the 80's and still resonate in films like The Last Samurai. Do yourself a favor and enjoy the mini-series that started it all.",1438732800,9,9118,4.592137592137592

Many years earlier as a college student majoring in history, one of the courses was a brief study Japanese history which I found to be very fascinating.  The recently released HDTV Blu-Ray 9 hour edition of Shogun is much better than the advertisement-laced 12 one hour episodes on a 26"" TV.  We spent three consecutive nights viewing the Shogun ""movie"" on our 72"" screen AV system.  If you have the capability to customize your audio, I highly recommend you use the Set UP menu on each of the three disks.  Shogun is a novel accurately based on 17th century Japanese history.  There are no sub-titles in this English/Japanese production.  Orson Wells provides narrative background to insure that the audience understands the progression of events.  Be sure to view all the extra features on each of the disks AFTER you have seen the entire movie.

1968555,4,B00012SZDG,"I previously had purchased the DVD version of this TV mini-series a few years ago and in comparison this 3 Disc Blu-Ray release version has much better sound and video. The video is very sharp and much more detailed. One drawback to this release however is that this 3 Disc version has been done as a single three part movie rather than in the original episodic format in previous DVD releases. As an example Disc 1 ends rather abruptly when Lord Toranaga walks into a room where Blackthorn is showing three ladies his sea chanty dance. Disc 2 ends in a similar manner. No fade out in either case at all. I much preferred the way it was done in the original DVD release, which was set up in a manner to how the episodes aired on TV rather than as a continuous movie broken into three parts. Another thing I noted is that the much sharper video tends to show some of the bad make-up used on many of the series background actors. As an example, you see on many of the Japanese actors the color difference between the real head skin and where they covered the hair with a skin applique rather than shave it to make them look like Samurai warriors. This difference is very glaring in some cases.  The infamous helicopter shadow you see at the very beginning is surprisingly still there and you can also see the wall beams on the special effects tank where they filmed the Galley being swamped by a storm and Blackthorn rescuing Rodriguez. You have to wonder why they didn't take care of these glitches during the restoration process, which would be a fairly simple matter to do. Apparently, they decided to preserve the original, warts and all, for this blue-ray release.

The Blackthorne character is large (in all physical aspects, as the ladies of Torunaga's court noticed when he took a bath), and lusty too; Chamberlain is not that at all and should have stuck to his Dr. Kildare TV success.)

To continue, the viewer should have the choice, depending on their needs. To force the viewer to engage in this ""You'll want to learn Japanese!"" approach is condescending and sophomoric and ultimately very confusing. The book was in English, including the words of the Japanese characters. So why not have included at least an alternative? This is a BlueRay, with more than enough space to indulge the English subs for Japanese only. This version now forces, once again, one to listen to English, listen to Japanese, but only get subtitles that reflect the English portion.

However, I freely admit that since I am keenly aware of the true history of the actual people Clavell based his characters on I have a biased view. Granting the title of 'Samurai' to Blackthorne is not only preposterous but then to make him 'Hatamoto' takes it to the level of 'bizarre'. It would be akin to Queen Elizabeth knighting a U.S. citizen and granting him Lordship over a castle in England. But I am most especially disconcerted with the characters of Mariko and her husband Buntaro. In real life, Buntaro was Lord Hosokawa Tadaoka. To this day the name of Hosokawa is revered in Japanese history and his wife Gracia while Christian was quite the exemplary Samurai wife. Had Clavell created instead a completely fictional Lord and love interest in Mariko instead, the story would have been more palatable.

Redemption for Shogun as a whole comes in its ability to express the more attractive attributes of Japanese culture. It is its one saving grace. Then again, any movie with the legendary Toshiro Mifune in a lead role automatically makes it worth a look.

4 stars for Mifune and a good introduction to Japanese culture of the 17th century. 2 stars for Clavell's blatant disrespect for several of Japan's most important historical figures.",1412985600,3,1331,4.859030837004405

1968579,4,B00012SZDG,"OVERALL  THIS RELEASE IS EXCELLENT GIVEN THE SOURCE MATERIAL (made for TV).  More on audio/video quality below.

This TV mini series is still generally considered one of the greatest mini series events in the history of American television.  It is based on a best selling novel by James Clavell.  That novel was so important to Western introduction of Japanese culture that in 1980 (the year the TV series aired), as many as 50% of all college students in Japanese related classes had read the novel.

THE PLOT: Fictional story woven together from threads of true persons and events.  Many names are changed for the story. -- Ships Pilot John Blackthorne has been hired to guide five Dutch ships to Spanish interests in the new world to disrupt (under sanction from the crown) their activities and plunder them.  On their journey around Cape Horne, 4 of the 5 ships are lost in a storm.  Blackthornes remaining ship, the Erasmus, flees the Spanish in a long journey that leaves him washed up on the shores of Japan after yet another storm (this is all narrated in the first 5 minutes).  The Dutch crew is held hostage by a local Samurai in order to keep Blackthorne in line.  Blackthorne ultimately travels with the regional Daimyo, Lord Yabu, to meet the head of the Counsel of Regents for the entire country, Lord Toranaga (based on the true figure Tokugawa Ieyasu).  Blackthorne's predicament is complicated further by the presence of Jesuit Priests who are enemies of England and the Netherlands.  They tell the Japanese lords that Blackthorne and his men are pirates.  However, Blackthorne manages to impress the Japanese through a series of events that prove his honor, loyalty and resourcefulness.  He is also eventually aided in learning the Japanese language and customs by a beautiful woman named Mariko with whom he falls in love.  Unfortunately she is the wife of Lord Buntaro, one of Toranaga's vassals.  Where Blackthorne is initially stunned by the seeming barbarity of the Samurai class, he eventually develops great respect for the Japanese culture and is set on the path to becoming something impossible for a foreigner, a Samurai.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:  Events in this story are mainly set in 1600 after the reunification of Japan (set in motion by Nobunaga and finished by Hideyoshi, predecessor to Tokugawa), but in the space after the death of the Hideyoshi figure and before the ascension of Tokugawa.  So the political situation is very tenuous!  The novel and TV show does compress a few events that happened before 1600.  The Jesuit involvement in trade in Japan is actually based on fact.  However, their influence was already on the decline by 1600 where the Japanese portion of this story begins.  Blackthorne's character is also based loosely on a real person named William Adams, though is garbled together with another occurrence called ""The San Filipe Incident of 1596"" where a captain of a Spanish galleon was shipwrecked on Japan and tried to bargain for the return of his cargo while Hideyoshi was still in power.  This real life captain claimed to Hideyoshi that Catholic missionaries were routinely sent to make converts before Christian countries exerted political and military influence to gain new conquests.  Hideyoshi recognized this pattern happening and set in motion a ban on Christian missionaries and largely closed the county to external influence that would last over two centuries.  He even crucified a number of missionaries.  It is important to note that Jesuits and other Christians still continued limited trade and operations in the country though.  In our fictional story, Jesuits still have significant influence when Blackthorne also relates a similar warning to Toranaga of impending political and military danger that follows missionaries (specifically Jesuits).

THIS BLU RAY RELEASE: I mentioned that there are limitations to the restoration of this series because it was made for TV.  To younger audiences, it may seem dated and lacking in a few areas.  The sound is the most noticeable weakness, though it says DTS Master Audio.  There is separation of sound and they did a fine job with what they had.  However, it is discernibly from a reworked mono source (not much you can do about that).  The video quality is actually very good for a TV series that age and a noticeable improvement over the older DVD releases.  There will be grainy shots here and there, but its pretty minimal all considered.  It is aspect ratio 4:3, as stated on the box.  If you saw it in wide screen on other releases the image was being cropped top and bottom (which is not the case here).  Of course it's not going to be reference quality compared to new productions today.  However, the fairly authentic setting of Pre-Edo Japan overcomes the dated stuff I mentioned.  The cultural introduction is amazing (I have since lived in Japan and made Japanese my major in college).  This show is extraordinarily authentic (for late 70's early a 80's productions) and filmed in some of the most beautiful castles in Japan.  The costumes of the Daimyo and Shogun are gorgeous!  I have seen other old TV show restorations that can't touch this one so give it a little slack for it's source material and enjoy a major TV event all over again.",1406073600,153,5275,4.945454545454545
