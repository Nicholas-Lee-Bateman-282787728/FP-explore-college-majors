8033321,3,B0002VJ7TW,"When I was renting a few videos they said I could grab two more to get the cheaper rental deal they had going, and I had glanced at this films cover when selecting the others in the horror movie section, and I figured, ""what the hell""

When I first put it on, the story of camp councillors in the woods telling ghost stories of a psychopath that was killed out there and then returned to take his revenge on those that let him die sounded all too familiar (ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma)

Even hearing the heroin's murdered brother of the movie was named Jason. And their friend Mike (Myers was it?) seemed to be really pushing the limits to me either saying, ""this is a cheesy fan made horror movie of the slasher genre, or a complete rip off of Friday The 13th. [not to forget, a Jason type of mask is worn for a prank]

However, even tho I would definitely say this is the creators version of a Friday The 13th film, by the time it ended, I thought it was not too bad, and one of the better copycat type of films for this genre.

The plot of the movie is about some councillors who have just finished looking after the kids for the summer, the children have gone home and there sticking around for the last couple of days to pack up the campsite to go home. They tell a story of Trevor Moorhouse, who was killed by councillors and came back to seek his revenge.

I guess that might have been the plot of the first movie, which I have not seen. So hopefully I will be able to track that one down and see if it was as good as it's sequel. After this ghost story, the councillor's don't believe the story, except for one of them, but they soon find themselves in jeopardy in the typical slasher stalks them in the woods and cabins motif.

While it is a copy-cat of Friday The 13th, it portrays it in it's own way, not copying every element that makes that slasher series and instead of just using the kill for the hell of killing plot, you get to know these characters better then a Friday The 13th movie where it's all ""no one will help us, we have to do it ourselves"" to a more believable scenario.

The gore fans may enjoy some of the bloody kills in this. For a low budget movie that starts off looking like a cheap copy-cat independent film eventually involves into an entertaining horror/thriller with plenty of action, suspense and a ""who done it"" that was not the most predictable thing for you to work out.

I did not figure out who the killer was till the end scenes, so it may take you a while to figure it out too. However, If I was making this movie, I might have gone for a better ending, or more drawn out. It seemed to be pretty quick, and that's about the only downfall of the movie.

However, I still give it 4 stars It was pretty entertaining, the characters aren't the annoying airheads you usually find in these slasher films that just say something stupid, don't believe what's going on, show there naked body and get gutted.

Tho as usual, it does go for some un-needed nudity, at least it's only the one woman, and not every one of them leaving you thinking, ""God, is this how the expected to get people to see this with an actor who can't act but shows her breasts at the drop of a hat?""

Overall, I think the Friday The 13th fans like myself will see it's not a direct rip off, but more a nod to those movies, and says clearly, ""this was made by a fan of slasher movies, but it's done pretty well""",1214697600,,3411,4.2323076923076925
8033322,2,B0002VJ7TW,this movie is long 4 no reason long long long long kill they ass and lets move on,1115078400,,81,3.5555555555555554
8033323,4,B0002VJ7TW,"This is an entertaining example of the teen slasher genre.  A bunch of teenagers are isolated in a holiday camp cleaning up after the summer activities and closing the site down.  Predictably, the one by one murder of the teenage characters by an unknown killer provides the suspense and drives the plot along.  The murders seem quite well depicted and occur sometimes unexpectedly with a harder more full-on edge than in some similar movies.  The movie also contains some full frontal sex scenes that spice up the camp a bit.  Overall the first hour or so is entertaining and well written.  The last 20 minutes are somewhat predictable as the remaining teen survivor battles to escape from the killer, struggling to find the keys to the truck etc.  At this point you could probably turn it off.  Overall, this is worthwhile watching, and has some intelligently crafted bits in it.",1110499200,,881,4.826666666666667
8033324,3,B0002VJ7TW,"THe movie is good , but the killer in this movie is nothing like hte first film , It was an ok film it had some good nudity but the story is kinda horrible. I recomend it to people who like to collect masks killer movies , like me . Good movie but rent before you own.",1103673600,,268,3.719298245614035
8033325,2,B0002VJ7TW,"This movie was stupid.  The old JASON movies are alot better.
The story was boring.  They all could have left along time before everyone dies.
BUT for a cheap movie it didn't LOOK too bad.
They had one token girl for a couple nude scenes that should have kept her clothes ON (Ms. Shepis)
Don't waste your time with this film",1073088000,,324,4.295081967213115
