Also, I have tried in vain to find a copy of the book ""No Drums, No Trumpets"" (except for very expensive collector's editions).  Libraries will not even loan this book out.  Therefore, I wish that someone would reprint this book.  Please, pretty please!!!",1236988800,,316,4.589285714285714
497301,5,6302639972,"Mary Lindell is a household name in Great Britain. Thank God that HALLMARK took the time to recreate her daringly true escapades in smuggling evaders into unoccupied zones during WW2. For dramatic purposes, much of ONE AGAINST THE WIND has been rearranged and condensed . As exciting as this presentation of Mary Lindell's exploits is, her real life was even MORE dramatic than what HALLMARK assembled!( Read the book NO DRUMS,NO TRUMPETS by J.B. Wayne!!!!!)

Nevertheless, this film is extraordinary for what it accomplishes and Judy Davis is spot-on as the resourceful,courageous and mulishly strong-minded Mary. It is significant to note that Mary Lindell was 45 years old when she and her family began smuggling people out of occupied France, first by sheer bluff and boldness! Her methods became much more ""professional"" as the War dragged on. The focus of ONE AGAINST THE WIND is more towards the end of her smuggling people into Spain, more in particular Australian bomber pilot McSweyen (Sam Neill).Lindell actually had three children, two boys and a little girl. The son Maurice, is a composite of her two sons, and daughter Barbe (Kate Beckinsale) is pretty much invented along with her attraction to a Nazi officer for dramatic purposes. This makes for a great screenplay and creates dramatic tension, but it's not true. Other than that, ONE AGAINST THE WIND is about as exciting and daredevilish as a film can get (especially for HALLMARK!).

Great similar companion films would be BLACK BOOK, VARIAN'S WAR and CHARLOTTE GRAY.",1182297600,4,1538,5.099206349206349
497302,5,6302639972,"A great movie in every way. A true story better than fiction. Acting, actors actually acting as true real life charachters in one of the best stories ever told. This is a great movie. As a side story it is Kate Bekinsales entry to the industry (that I know of).",1176163200,,261,4.24
497303,5,6302639972,"I have owned two copies of ""One Against the Wind""--because I wore out the first one! You can get the story from other reviews. I show this movie to college freshman in a writing class where we talk about being your highest and best self and making moral choices (among other things). It's entertaining, riveting, and a great springboard for discussion. I don't want to have to buy another VHS--Hallmark, please, transfer this movie to DVD as you have with ""The Love Letter"" and ""What the Deaf Man Heard.""",1024704000,24,504,4.674157303370786
497304,5,6302639972,"Judy Davis and Sam Neill headline this Hallmark Hall of Fame movie.  The story is set France during the early days of Nazi occupation.  Davis plays an outspoken, brash, high-profile, American-born French countess (by marriage).  She and her two children, a son and a daughter, plunge into peril when Davis compulsively decides to help Neill, a British flier shot down over France.  Their first interaction is classic -- Davis packs quite a wallop!
Davis goes on to become a player in helping downed allied fliers escape from occupied territory.
In the meantime, a Nazi officer is bound and determined to make an example of Davis...and thus the story develops and continues through the end of the war.
This is a ""must-watch"" movie.  There is action, intruige, and incredible courage in the face of danger.
5 stars all the way!  Whatever you do, don't miss this movie!

497305,4,6302639972,"Judy Davis and Sam Neill have appeared together in a number of films.  They work so well together you think they must be like Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy--married in real life--but alas they are not. I first saw  them in a film made 'down under' (I think they are both Australian)  ""My Brilliant Career.""  Sam was chasing Judy, and as usual she  was spurning him.
In this wonderful Hallmark Hall of Fame production,  Judy Davis plays the Comtesse Mary Lindell, two-time winner of the 'Croix  de Guerre' and Sam Neille plays a British pilot shot down over France in  the early days of WWII who goes on to become a Brigadier General. The  Comtesse Mary Lindell inadvertantly saves Neill--the downed pilot--and  thereby hangs a tale.
The Comtesse Lindell is a heroine girls can look up  to. As a French citizen and a Comtesse, she was relatively unmolested by  the Germans when they invaded France and would not have appeared to have  had a stong motive to do the things she did and risk her life and the lives  of her children. Lindell's daughter actually became involved with a German  officer. However, Lindell had been a Red Cross nurse in WWI, for which she  was awarded the Croix de Guerre for her assistance to both French and  German soldiers alike, and she was a compassionate and caring person.
In  WWII, Lindell developed a stake in the salvation of British, American,  Canadian and other Allied pilots, because she accidently saved the life of  a single British pilot. He spread the word, and before she knew it, she was  inundated with downed pilots seeking her assistance. She could not stand by  and watch the Nazis shoot them in the street, in the churches, anywhere  they found them.  When she was captuered and imprisoned for assisting the  enemy, her son stood in for her.  Eventually, she was released and resumed  her underground career. Her son and her daughter, her friends and a host of  other partisans helped her form the ""Marie"" underground network  which smuggled countless Allied airmen out of harm's way through the  southern border of France. For her heroism, Lindell was awarded another  'Croix de Guerre' at the end of the war.
This is a fine video, well  constructed, and a joy to watch. I think you'll watch it more than once.",961286400,44,2260,4.70076726342711

An excellent film to show to students who are studying WW II, and also a great one to watch. It's pretty clean with only mild language. I would say that it's safe to show to children except there are a couple scenes that are pretty graphic, especially the part where Lindell's son Maurice is being questioned by the Nazis. Highly recommend watching it.",1254528000,,462,4.646341463414634
497395,3,6302639972,"This was a pretty solid Hallmark Hall Of Fame made-for-TV story about a real- life woman ""Countess Mary Lindell"" (Judy Davis) who helped Allies during World War II.

Many of the military men in need were downed pilots and Lindell would help these men get safely out of occupied France. Her character was a strong one and her resolve to do what she could against the Germans was resolute. Helping her accomplish that were her kids: a son and a daughter (a young Kate Beckinsale!).

The story lags in spots or I would have rated it higher.  I'd watch this again if someone would issue it on DVD.",1238371200,2,593,4.472222222222222

7829744,5,6302639972,"This film hooked me on Hallmark Hall of Fame offerings.

This film, based on the life of Mary Lindell, is entertaining and notable.  Judy Davis and Sam Neill headline the cast...and there's not a weak performance among them.

SPOILER ALERT
Lindell, an American expatriate living in Paris with her son and daughter, finds herself being sought out by downed allied fliers who are looking for someone, anyone to help them escape back to Great Britain.  She ends up developing and maintaining an escape organization right under the noses of curious and suspicious German intelligence officers.

Lindell was reportedly a controversial figure - was she a member of the resistance, a German double agent, what?  I don't know, but I prefer to view her as portrayed by Davis in this fine made for TV film.

IMO it's too bad that this movie is not available on DVD.  I'd certainly buy one.  In the meantime I'll keep watching the one I have on tape.
