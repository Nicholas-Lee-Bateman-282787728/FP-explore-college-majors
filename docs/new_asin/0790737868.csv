118576,5,0790737868,"This is a brilliant film about the thin line between love and hate, and how things can go wrong. It seems to be the same ""Bonnie and Clyde beginner's film hash off"" type of movie but it isn't. At times, it's  even better, because of Malick's detailed, breath-taking Kubrick-like  photography. Great acting and well-built suspense doesn't get tiring, and  is gripping throughout the entire movie. Worth a rent.",934156800,,409,4.985294117647059
118577,5,0790737868,Sissy Specek and Martin Sheen perform well in the story of love on the run. It's heartbreaking to see Specek's torn between the love for a rebellious young man.  And the heartbreak of leaving her dead father  knowing that the man she thinks she loves is also the man who kills him.  People who live in large cities will love the panoramic scenes of the wide  open prairies.,930182400,,373,4.4411764705882355
118578,5,0790737868,"I have read the other reviews here and i couldn't  help but add a few things. I absolutely loved
this film, but it bears some interest that it is
partly based on the Merriweather murders of the
late 1960's.  Mallick seems to inherit an america
quite different from the on we had  become
accustomed to. He takes very familiar motifs from
american  culture and puts a new spin on it, one
which would have been impossible  before the
Vietnam War.  If you find that you like this film i
would highly recommend a few other little things.
First, Bruce  Springsteens Nebraska album which
was inspired in part by the movie and  a book
about the Merriweather murders. Second, and more
unrelated Ian  Fraziers: The Great Plains which is
a book of nonfiction about the  history and
culture of the Great Plains. Finally, in emotion
and  temperment Cormac McCarthy's The Crossing,
which has a similar feel to  it.",924825600,,900,4.662420382165605

118639,5,0790737868,"Watching the film under review, Badlands, made me thing back to the days when my own corner boys were taking their various turns toward life decisions which led some of them to plenty of time in various state pens and others into white collar professional life. One guy from the corner in particular reminded me of Kit, the sullen, cranky, whacko, maybe even misunderstood youth played by Martin Sheen, a guy named Pretty James Preston (who got the name Pretty from all the girls who swarmed around him from junior high on and the name stuck) who ended face down in a hail of bullets after killing a security guard in a botched lone wolf bank holdup. He, seemingly like Kit, had not started out as a desperado but everywhere he turned he got bumped around by society, got bumped around by his own inner hurts and outrageous wanting habits. Of course in those day, the 1950s, the same time frame of this film and Prettys time too such sullen youth, called juvenile delinquents, JDs, were seen as almost as much as a threat to the good social order as the Cold War Red Menace that made every self-respecting person nervous (and so thought maybe the Reds had put those guys up to their wicked ways).

Here is the way this one played out in Badlands, played out not all that differently than a lot of other corner boy stories from back then except Kit went way over the edge like Pretty James had done. Played out as told in appropriate flash-back fashion by Holly, played by Sissy Spacek, the girl who rode out the storms of his young life with him and an eyewitness to his moods and madnesses. See Kit was just drifting around out there in the foothills of the badlands (the physical place and the place in his head), playing the dime store cowboy philosopher king when he hitched up with Holly, a young impressible young girl of fifteen who seemed like him in many ways, not much of a talker keeping her own counsel who opened up as Kit got a stronger hold on her. They fell in love, the old-fashioned for keeps kind. The problem though was that Hollys single parent father saw nothing but evil, or maybe his younger self in Kit and banished Kit from seeing Holly. But you didn't so that to Kit, you didn't not let him have what he wanted as it turned out. So naturally in order to solve the problem Kit shot the old man dead in his own home. And called Holly, called her on her love for him to go away with him on the run-which way would she go.

In the short haul she went with Kit, blew town after Kit burned her fathers house down to hide evidence or something (our boy didn't always think everything out in the right direction). From then on they were on the run. First setting up camp in an almost Adam and Eve paradise wilderness fast. But something evil, banally evil, got triggered in Kit by that first killing. Maybe he got blood simple like a lot of guys, maybe he saw that his place in the sun was his fifteen minutes of fame as a mass murderer. Who knows all anybody knew was that when threatened he shot first and asked questions later. And Holly stuck by him until even she saw there was no future with her man, and that he was in a different place. So one day she just stopped after another one of Kits shoot-outs. Hell, even he stopped once he knew he had run out of room even in the vast Badlands. Maybe that said it all, In any case they executed him without a whimper. As for Holly, well, she told us the story so she survived and prospered in the end. Damn, but if this story didn't remind me of Pretty James Preston and I close I came to that same fate. See this one.",1468281600,,3588,4.306213017751479

The ""look"" is what makes this film. There are many breathtaking shots of the Badlands landscape, which gives the viewer the feeling that the characters aren't going to last very long on the run in the openness of the Badlands. This film is very unique not only because where it takes place, but also the survival tactics used.

118656,5,0790737868,"Terrence Malick has an ability like almost no other director to make ordinary things beautiful. He sees something in nature that other people don't and can capture it on film. His movies try to take the viewer into a mystical experience, where the shots and music have a meaning much greater than the story being told. The piece of art as a whole tends to rise above the story, which turns into a vehicle for the message: a message communicated through vision and sound rather than conceptual language.

 Badlands has some of Malicks idiosyncratic abstract/mystical style, but the message is more about human behavior than some of his later films. It is an earlier Malick movie and is much more character driven (like Days of Heaven 1978). It is a story about a 15 year-old girl named Holly (Sissey Spacek) who enters a relationship with a man in his mid 20s named Kit (Martin Sheen). Kit murders Hollys father for preventing their relationship and Holly and Kit become vigilantes on the run across America.

 Kit has a complete lack of ambition and direction and due to this fact seems to act completely in the moment. This leads him to kill and rob without much anxiety or reflection on what he is doing. On the other hand, throughout the movie he is philosophical and talks about his actions in moral terms and explains why he killed this person or that based on ethical principles. There is a complete disconnect between the values he places on other people and the behavior he engages in and he shows no remorse for hurting others so long it is in his interest. In this sense, it could be argued that he is psychotic.

 There is also the 'James Dean' aspect to Kit. Kit, it seems, has intentionally modelled himself on James Dean: both his look and his reckless bad boy behaviour. I think here Malick is pointing out that when individuals have no meaning and ambition in their life, they will simply take on some arbitrary persona: in this case being the one popularised through movies. Movie and television step-up to fill the nihilist void.

 Holly follows Kit across America. Her mother died when she was young and throughout the movie she is involved in an extreme chain of events but at the same time completely detached. Having Holly narrate the film emphasizes this detachment. Holly has disengaged from life and moves with whatever is the stronger force acting upon her. On the other hand, she speaks at times of going with Kit because he, unlike other people, was actually interested in her; yet throughout the film she argues with Kit about him never listening to her and seems thoroughly distant from him. Once more we find a disconnection between what someone is saying, this time Holly the narrator, and her actions.

 What is Malick saying here? The film was made in 1973: a time where there was a tension between young people who wanted to live away from the restrictions of society and have a more transient and counter-cultural lifestyle. One could argue that Malick is making a statement about the hypocrisy and childishness of the youth of his generation. They make decisions based on pure selfishness and cover this up this with rhetoric.

 I think the fact that Badlands is a movie set in the 1950s in rural American seems to discredit the above interpretation: the environment could not be further from the counter-culture movement of San Francisco in the 60s. It could be that Malick is saying yes, this is going on now among the hippy generation, but it is nothing new: humans have always acted selfishly under the guise of something grander. I think that whatever one takes the message it be, it is likely to be more universal than a simple statement about the selfishness of the 1960s and early 70s.

 Malick is such a subtle filmmaker. Nothing in this film is overstated and the viewer is left with enough to have a idea of that the message is, but not with the sense of it being forced on them. It is not a depressing movie either: he presents the characters as engaging thoughtlessly in a chain of events rather than being tormented by inner demons. It is very watchable: aesthetically pleasing, and gentle even while dealing with a violent story.

 This is my favorite Malick movie (possibly tied with Days of Heaven). While Badlands is at times abstract, I sense at this stage Malick had not completely solidified how he saw the world. It has the mystical elements of Tree of Life, but is not completely detached from human life and is a much more gentle and at times even soothing viewing experience.

Martin Sheen was out of this world handsome and he did an amazing job in his role as the ultimate 'bad boy'. Sissy Spacek has always been a favorite of mine especially after seeing her in Coal Miners' Daughter. She was so young and so pretty in this movie and did such a good job with it. It was an exciting movie as well as a sad one, too. I enjoyed the action as I had to keep in mind that it was not real. I thought the entire movie moved along at a good pace and there were no dull parts in it at all. I noticed that Charlie Sheen had a supporting role in this movie, too, as a youngster. The music was good. The scenery was very realistic and even the dust clouds from the fast driving seemed remarkable.

118672,4,0790737868,"Malick's target in this immaculate-looking film seems to be American pop culture. Or, to put it another way, America's profound lack of a deep and meaningful culture. He blames the moral void of the two lovers played by Sheen and Spacek on the spiritual desert of American culture. These two merely and faithfully reflect the blankness around them. Malick suggests that this void can be healed by a return to Nature. However, he worries that pop culture has invaded our minds to such an extent that we can't return to Nature. When Sheen and Spacek build a hideaway in the woods, it's obvious they've been influenced by newsreel footage of Vietnam that they've seen on TV. Sheen looks like James Dean because he's been influenced by the real James Dean as seen in the movies. Surrounding landscapes of brightly colored billboards and ads telling us to drink Coke and Eat at Joe's reinforce Malick's view of pop culture as blinding and suffocating. Only at the very end when the lovers make a mad dash across the Montana badlands towards a distant mountaintop do they achieve some kind of true freedom from society. The aerial footage at the end suggests apotheosis and Heaven, as if in his final days Sheen has realized the value of life--that life in a small, dinky town is better than no life at all.

For all of its visual elegance and exceedingly fine acting, Badlands is a total drag that is very misdirected. Sure, American pop culture has its faults, but it has its strong points, too. It's a lot more fun than European culture, and somebody needs to remind Malick that American culture is only about two to three centuries old. The Europeans have at least a thousand years' head start on us. Besides, no individual can blame their crimes on society and get away with it. You have to take that blame on yourself, no matter how awful your environment or how unhappy your childhood.",1420329600,,1886,4.697885196374623

118682,4,0790737868,"Badlands was regarded as one of the great films of the 1970's. It was the first movie made by Terrance Malick. He only made 2 movies in the 70's, this one and the 1978 film Days of Heaven. Both films were praised for thier lyrical and romantic look in terms of locations and the beautiful scenery. Badlands is a very simple movie in terms of its plot. Basically it's about a strange and distured man named kit. He works as a garbage man but then is fired and because he cant find a regular job he decides to run away with his new girlfriend. And on their journey he just kills people by shooting them. The movie never explains why he does it, basically it's an observation of his behavior. Martin Sheen plays kit and he gives a great performance. It's one of those great character actor performances that great actors love to play. The way they change their voice and play someone totally different from themselves. Sissy Spacek plays his young girlfriend. She does narration for the film and she also gives a very good performance. She plays basically a young naive girl who just goes along with kit until she realizes he's crazy and doesnt want to be with him anymore.

One Malick trope that I look forward to in each of his films is when he stops the action to focus on an animal - the message being that around, beyond, and above our silly, pointless human striving, nature continues, oblivious. There's none of that here. Also, character development is not Malick's strong suit - the characters in his films have already experienced their arc, and it is only a matter of gradually communicating this to us. In ""Badlands,"" this approach doesn't work - we never understand why Kit suddenly decides to become a spree killer - it just happens for no reason. Holly is also not credible as she has no more reaction to her father's murder and the random killings that follow, than if she were browsing booths at a yarn convention. We are supposed to accept that a perfectly ordinary garbageman and an even more ordinary high school girl could suddenly take off across the country, killing virtually everyone unlucky enough to meet them, just because Holly's father wants to end their relationship.

Malick's succeeding films have been more visual and less talky. ""Badlands"" is further ruined by Sissy Spacek's incessant internal chatter, which ironically does nothing to illuminate the proceedings. There's a little bit of Malick's trademark ""who am I? Why am I here?"" when she wonders at one point in the journey where she would be at that moment if she had never met Kit, and what her future imaginary husband is doing at that same moment. Is he thinking about her, even though he has not met her yet? Other than those 30 seconds, her musings were a pointless annoyance.

Many great filmmakers do not find their voice immediately. Often their best work comes later in their careers. I'm not sure what I would have thought had I seen ""Badlands"" when it first came out, but in retrospect, it contains hints of the visual and storytelling style that would serve Malick well in his other films. I can only recommend this one for completists.

118693,4,0790737868,"When I was in college, I asked and received a one-term sabbatical to apply for a software patent.  Unfortunately for me, I didn't win that patent; I was about three-to-six months late applying.  What you quickly find out during a process like that:  there may be many patents pending, and since it takes two years or more for an application to move through its necessary transitions, there may be patents that are similar to yours that, without working at the patent office and performing some late-night covert op, you'll never know about.  At least until yours is rejected much later as it ""infringes"" on another that was in the pipeline at the same time.  So applying for a patent is a crap shoot, and best left up to lawyers and large companies with large bank accounts.

While I know a fair amount about the patent process now, I don't know much about the legal end of the film business.  I did read an article once from a screenwriter who discussed these issues, and from what I remember, he wrote that, if you create a film that is based upon a true story, and you want to use real names of living people, you need to get sign off from those people to use their real names with their real stories.  Supposedly, that's why some of the characters in the film ""Frozen Ground"" were amalgams of real-life people but with fictional names.  I believe that there was at least one Anchorage detective who hunted for Robert Hansen, where that detective wouldn't sign off on his name for the film.  (After watching that film, I would agree with his position.  I didn't like the end product for a variety of reasons.)

And I think that this is why filmmakers sometimes just throw up their hands, and make movies such as ""Badlands"" that are ""based upon actual events,"" or other such nonsense.  ""Why even bother trying to tell the real story?  We'll just get sued,"" is most likely the position that most filmmakers take.  I did watch the film ""Starkweather"" a while back, and that was a film that I actually really liked, even though I believe that the acting is somewhat wooden like what you would see in a David Lynch film.  But that film used the real names, and it used real events, and I appreciated the ""realness"" of it all.  I was able to be entertained and learn mostly the real story at the same time.

But I believe that ""Starkweather"" could go beyond the ""based upon actual events"" verbiage because most of the real-life characters were deceased by the time that it was filmed in the early 2000s.  Caril Anne Fugate was still alive at the time -- she almost died last year in a bad car accident though, and it is unclear about her current state -- but the filmmakers most likely believed that enough time had passed so that they could use the true story.

And while the events in ""Badlands"" may not be the ""true story,"" it is a very good film.  Before renting, I had no idea that it was directed by Terrance Malick, who obviously has some serious credentials.  In particular, I really liked ""Tree of Life"" (TOL) even though I borderline hated the ending.  But once again, in ""Badlands,"" just like TOL, the cinematography is excellent.  But I really thought that the digital transfer to HD in this film is really, really sharp.  I watched this using my new Blu-ray player with a built-in Amazon Prime app on a Sharp 1080P set, and it looks fantastic.

The acting is very nice as well.  Note a very young Sissy Spacek -- I guess she was in her early 20s when this was filmed, but she looked like she was a young teenager with nearly-must-have-been-illegal-short shorts -- and a young Martin Sheen as well.  I've been hit-and-miss over the years with Mr. Sheen; I believe that, in his family, the order of skill from best to worst goes:  Emilio Estevez, Martin Sheen, and then bringing up the rear:  Charlie Sheen.  But Martin was a fine choice in this film, as I believe that he channels a young Charley Starkweather.

And check out the old ""Voice-o-graph"" machine!  I've never seen one before, but way before iPads, way before iPhones, way before iPods, way before CDs, way before cassettes, way before 8-track tapes, there was a machine where you could speak into it for 50 cents (probably a lot of money in the 50s) and record your voice on a record.  Yeah, one of those round, black things that play on a turntable!  Perhaps you've never seen one?

Well, I think that it is too bad that legal issues get in the way of filmmaking sometimes.  But here, no matter.  Mr. Malick somehow worked around them anyways and still managed to make a really good film.",1391990400,,4560,4.5225885225885225
118694,3,0790737868,"It's a quite watchable crime film, inspired by real events - but honestly, I couldn't really find anything particularly remarkable in it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The inspiration for this film was the real case of Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate who murdered eleven people between 30 November 1957 and their arrestation on 29 January 1958. When arrested, Starkweather was 20 years old but Caril Ann Fugate was barely 14 years old... Starkweather was sentenced to death and executed - Fugate was sentenced to life in prison, but was paroled after 17 years. Other than ""Badlands"", this strange and horrible couple inspired also the film ""Natural Born Killers""...

""Badlands"" is not exactly about Starkweather-Fugate murder spree, but there are great similarities. The main protagonist, Kit Carruthers (Martin Sheen), is older than Starkweather (he is 25) and it is stressed that he is also very good looking (which was DEFINITELY not the case of Starkweater). His girlfriend, Holly Sargis (Sissy Spacek) is 15 and she actually doesn't actively participate in the murders (which has influence on her final fate). Also, unlike Caril Ann Fugate who lived in a regular, normally functionning family, with both her parents and a baby sister, Holly lives only with her father, who is shown as a particularly nasty character...

The story is tragic and sad and the film is well made, no argument there, but I couldn't find any particular greatness in it. If anything, I was a little bit bothered by the sympathy shown by the director to Kit Carruthers, who in my modest opinion, didn't deserve any. He is, after all, a 25 years old fully grown man who, with his looks and wits, could have any woman he wants, but who instead goes after a CHILD and therefore commits (repeatedly) statutory rape!

I mean, what is wrong with this guy!? And then he actually escalates into even worse crimes - but the director doesn't seem to find anything of it very serious... No, in fact the film almost seems to show that those who cross Carruthers path are the ones who are guilty - because they bother him and prevent him from enjoying life... Even the title of this film seems to take away the blame from the killer - it is not him, it is just that in this rural country life is so boring and empty that it actually makes sense to go on killing people who displease you...

The character of Holly on another hand is better and she actually can be seen with some considerable pity. There is something clearly wrong with her, as she doesn't seem to feel anything for the victims of murders and even if she doesn't enjoy sex very much she still follows blindly and obeys without a fuss the man who half-seduced, half-abducted her (""I wouldn't mess with Kit, you know? Me, when he says ""frog"", I hop..."") - but, well, after all she is still a child and a vulnerable one with that, maybe even slightly ntally delayed... Sissy Spacek (who was 24 at that time but looked definitely younger) certainly portrayed her very well.

So, all in all, I admit that this is a quite honest, watchable film, definitely less disgusting than ""Natural Born Killers"", but I really cannot consider this as a masterpiece. For me, it is a film to rent and see once. Which I did.",1391644800,,3275,4.716783216783217

118701,3,0790737868,"""The film set the precedent for future works like Natural Born Killers and Kalifornia. The film inspired a wave of indie film fans and people to appreciate the enigmatic work of Terrence Malick. The film notoriously was rated PG despite having very controversial situations and graphic violence which it should have been rated R back in 1973.

Badlands, Malick's feature debut, is one of allsorts as it manages to be an existential drama (especially considering the xylophone/glockenspiel soundtrack at parts), a gritty action-thriller, a romance, and a take on both the James Dean school of attitude and Charles Starkweather's vicious killings. Martin Sheen (as Kitt) gives a particularly good performance here but it is Sissy Spacek as Sheen's companion character (Holly) in the film that is more intriguing because she offers the audience a perspective of what just occurred, her emotions, and the complexities of being a teenager aching for a little spice in her life. Unfortunately, things turn for the worst when she starts seeing her boyfriend being trigger-happy.

The story comes across as a bit simple but the element of two outlaws is reminiscent pretty much of the crime-gangster genre and Badlands is pretty much reflective of that. The ending scenes which involve (SPOILER ALERT) Kitt on the run from the law (SPOILER ALERT) are alarming, scene-stealing, and surprisingly funny in a dark way. In addition, a scene where Kitt confesses (SPOILER ALERT) the murder of Holly's father (SPOILER ALERT) on a voice-recording phonograph is just amazing and it almost made me want to buy one of those at an auction Aside from that, the film remains more of a testament to independent film (being done on a budget at the time for about $300,000) and a piece of Americana in its darkest turn than a particularly enjoyable or involving film for me personally.

I can understand why this film was included in so many books but if I were to watch a James Dean kicking about and raising hell, I would rather watch Rebel Without a Cause. In addition, the film's PG rating (without nagging like a parent) is very problematic (at least in Britain it is 18 certificate but now it has a 15 cert.). It's not even remotely PG-13 too.""",1384041600,,2225,4.928
118702,2,0790737868,"This movie was incredibly slow paced.  Even though the description of the movie says based on the Starkweather murder spree, there are enough differences to make it hard to tie it to Starkweather.  The victim list was incomplete; the mother and sister of Carol Ann Fugate were murdered as well as the wife of the rich man. Starkweather didn't kill any vigilantes or officers and the the murders were out of sequence. Also Starkweather didn't build a castle out in the middle of the woods.
 It just fictional story with few similarities. In my opinion when you change so many things, it shouldn't be identified as being based on a true story.",1382140800,,641,4.705357142857143

118705,5,0790737868,"In the late 1950s, fifteen year old Holly (Sissy Spacek) moves from Texas to South Dakota with her sign painter father (Warren Oates) after her mother dies. Kit Carruthers (Martin Sheen), who styles himself after James Dean, takes an interest in Holly, which her father tries to deter by enrolling her in piano and clarinet lessons and collecting her after school, but Kit isn't so easily discouraged. Kit and Holly drive across the country, leaving a trail of bodies behind them.

I hadn't before now understood why Terrence Malick was so highly regarded. The Thin Red Line (1998), his Pacific war film which attracted every American actor then working, seemed oddly empty and inert; if it was meant to present vision of nature's glory flourishing, indifferent to man's futile actions, it was the sense of indifference that stayed with me. The Tree of Life (2011) surrounded an impressively photographed series of fragments and images from a 1950s Texas childhood with a bunch of numinous hooey that meant about as much as the creation story in Prometheus, albeit with cool dinosaurs.

Badlands, by contrast, is plot-driven, reasonably paced, menacing, surprising, and funny. It's one of those cinematic ur-texts that has been hugely influential, which leads to it feeling contemporary, like Orson Welles' Touch of Evil or 8 1/2, despite now being 40 years old. It feels sui generis, despite having a close antecedent of two bank robbers who become popular heroes (1967's Bonnie and Clyde, considered along with Easy Rider to be one of the films which dragged Hollywood into modern times; its director, Arthur Penn, received special thanks in the credits of Badlands), and an older, gender-reversed one in Gun Crazy (1950), in which circus sharpshooter Peggy Cummins takes patsy John Dall on a cross country rob and slay spree. Both of those films have robbery as the couples' motives (pretty tenuously in the case of Gun Crazy), whereas here, as Holly very belatedly realises, Kit is just trigger happy.

After the first death, Kit and Holly flee to the woods and build an elaborate treehouse, fortified with camouflaged hidey holes and booby traps. They survive by netting fish and raising chickens. It's like a homicidal version of the two children running into the wilderness to start their life together in Moonrise Kingdom. There's a scene of Kit, bare chested and wearing a bandana, shooting at targets while making unnecessarily elaborate leaps and twists, that suggests the makers of Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) had Badlands in mind when they conceived Mark Duplass's training sessions for travelling in time. Kit's childlike simplicity matches Holly's, which isn't to say he's some kind of innocent or unaware of the effect of his actions on the public: he revels in the reactions to news of his exploits, and whenever he has the opportunity, commits Great Thoughts to posterity on recording devices  ("" Listen to your parents and teachers. They got a line on most things, so don't treat 'em like enemies...Try to keep an open mind. Try to understand the viewpoints of others."")

Holly describes herself as having no personality, and is passive and affectless much of the time, but more as if she doesn't recognise what's going on rather than not caring; when a pair of potential witnesses arrive at a house where the fugitives are staying, Holly asks the girl about her feelings for her partner, as if they're waiting for the school bus. Her narration just occasionally implies some capacity for critical assessment or distance from the events she's a part of, as when she muses about what kind of man she'll eventually marry. Kit alternates between a similar blankness (""How are you feeling - tired?"" is as close as the two ever come to expressing emotion), self-serving rationalisation, incongruous statements implying a code of honour, and imparting his lofty thoughts.

The film stays wholly with Kit and Holly, so there's no attempt to develop the characters of the lawmen pursuing them, and the only people we see are hostages and victims. The police officers with speaking parts seem ready to be taken in by Kit's high opinion of himself, and his departure from Montana on a plane, in front of a crowd of police and national guardsmen, is like Elvis leaving town.

Equal or superior to all of the many films it influenced, Badlands lives up to its reputation.

I will note that the picture quality on this basic DVD is poor, and looks like a re-dub from VHS. I plan to invest in the Criterion version, which should do justice to the excellent photography and meticulous production design.",1363046400,4,4608,4.983094928478543

I would not think of saying anything negative about this movie, as it is one of my absolute favorites. Sadly, this is not a great DVD release, as the quality isn't fantastic and there aren't really any special features of note.

In addition, there is a huge problem with the aspect ratio as well. No, I didn't make a mistake and buy the Full Screen release when I should have gotten Widescreen -- I got the Widescreen release and it ended up being full screen. I kid you not, the release I  picked up said that it would be 1.85:1 and this was reflected on the DVD box when I opened it up. When I put the disc in, I found the disc also listed the AR on the disc art. Unfortunately, upon playing the movie, I discovered the only version that existed on the disc was the full screen version at 1.33:1.

I believe the WS release does exist, but the mere fact that there are releases out there that say they are WS when they are actually FS is reason enough to avoid this DVD.

I did like this movie. It was engaging, had an interesting plot despite the oh so familiar Bonnie and Clyde theme/premise, lush landscapes, great cinematography, a chilling score, and memorable characters. However, as with most if not all stories/movies about two lovers on the run from the law, the beginning and the end is the most exciting where as the middle feels long, meandering, and boring to read/watch. Badlands is no different. I wasn't all that impressed by Martin Sheen's portrayal of the James Dean look alike criminal misfit Kit. He looked the part of a bad boy I suppose but I didn't find the delivery to be all that chilling or frightening. Sissy as Holly, though, was extremely impressive considering how she portrayed a 15 year old as a 24 year old woman and made you truly believe that she was naive, love struck, clueless teenager. I wished the film as a whole was more chilling, frightening, and exciting. It has its disturbing moments but the execution fell flat for me. I also couldn't understand why none of the characters in the movie really reacted to Kit in horror or fear...I mean, he's this mass murderer that is public enemy #1 and yet every character's reaction to him is that of boredom or just no emotion at all. I felt that it made the film not as suspenseful and exciting as it should have been.

It's a good film that is definitely worth watching and respecting, especially for the two main lead actors and the director's vision (and for this to be his film debut, quite impressive indeed). I don't see myself watching it over and over again...and I'm not sure if it's worthy of all the hype since there are far more superior films of this ilk out there...but for what it's worth, it's a film worth taking notice.",1355788800,4,1883,4.584569732937686

As with his other works, the cinematography is almost a character unto itself, there is voice-over narration by one of the characters, and the filmmaker tries hard to impose a sense of epic on a story involving a handful of people.

Whether Malick succeeds or not is very much in the eye of the beholder -- and this, too, reflects his other films, including ""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Tree of Life."" Movie lovers tend to love or hate this director. Detractors say he's pretentious, overbearing; supporters speak of the lyricism and sweeping ambition of his films. I personally am a Malick fan, having been won over long ago by the man's imagination and bravery.

If you're not familiar with his work, ""Badlands"" is the place to start, partly because it's arguably the most direct and accessible of his films.

Martin Sheen and a young Sissy Spacek's strange psychotic relationship based on real life events are at the heart of Malicks directorial magnum opus. Much like Welles `Citizen Kane' Malick will never better Badlands - he and nobody else can. The movie is an intense visual and audio experience justifiably described by fellow director Tarantino as hauntingly beautiful. Karl Orff's signature musical score is used to hypnotic and memorable effect from the opening credits. For me the river scene is simply the best cinema every recorded. Badlands stands alone.

118719,3,0790737868,"I wanted to like this movie.  I really had great hope it was going to be one of those outlaw couple movies comparable to Bonnie and Clyde or Love and a .45.  I don't know though, something was lacking in the plot with this one.  A young Martin Sheen falls in love with an even younger Sissy Spacek, kills her artsy father and the two take off on the road. The problem is Martin Sheen can't stop killing people as Sissy Spacek just watches.  Some of the dialog seems like it's going to turn into something epic and memorable, but then it just falters.  Moments like when Sissy Spacek loses her virginity to Martin Sheen are just kind of played off as nothing of any significance - for example they don't really show anything and she says something like ""so what was everybody talking about?"".  Most of the movie turns into this type of unfinished and nondynamic play.  When Martin Sheen shoots one of his friends he worked with on a garbage truck, Sissy Spacek just goes into the room and starts talking to the guy about nothing of any importance.  When she decides to leave Martin Sheen to his own devices, there is no dramatic moment or big decision climax, it's just sort of a very milk toast she didn't want to go with him anymore type thing.  One of the most interesting parts is when the two shack up in the woods and make a little Swiss Family Robinson dwelling but that too leaves no conclusions.  I guess this movie just has alot of things that could have been great but were left to undone ends.  Even the chemistry is weird.  I did like the fact that the Martin Sheen character had a screw loose and seemed to be in the midst of some psychopathic prolonged episode.  Might I say that young Martin Sheen is fantastic and curious to look at because I don't remember seeing him too much that young.  Little nuances make this movie likable at some points.  For instance, in a very brief moment they show Sissy Spacek dolled up in this very innocent Alice in Wonderland style dress smoking a cigarette (picture the way she looked at 13 or 14).  Or how Martin Sheen wants to keep a rock from the place he made love to Sissy Spacek at for the first time and he picks up this huge rock, throws it down, and gets a smaller one.  This is like one of those movies that you will remember moments from, but you won't entirely recall the greatness or impact of it.  I probably won't watch it again personally.

118725,5,0790737868,"What a beautiful movie.  Definitely for Malick fans, who will appreciate the blunt realism and the National-Geographicish close-ups of nature and animals.  One of my favorite shots is of Martin Sheen standing on top of the car near the end, with the clouds behind him.  As with other Malick movies, this is a movie one arguably feels more than watches.  To me, this whole feeling-more-than-watching stuff is of significantly less extent than of what you get in, say, ""The Thin Red Line,"" Malick's 1998 WWII flick that marked his return to cinema after a two-decade AWOL.  In ""Badlands"" there's a lot more dialogue, though some of it's from Sissy Spacek's really young-sounding narration.  I'm not quite sure where Martin Sheen was at in his career when he starred in this movie, but this should definitely be considered a good movie that has him in it.  I read somewhere that this was his favorite movie that he'd been in.

A synopsis would be hardly enough to get you to watch this movie and experience it the way others do, or at least the way others who like it and say it's a good movie do.  Here's one, anyway.  Kit (Sheen) meets a young Holly (Spacek) in their quiet futureless town in South Dakota.  Kit likes Holly and this of course becomes an issue with Holly's father (Warren Oates).  What becomes an issue with everyone is when Kit shoots Holly's father, killing him, beginning a little spree that Kit takes on the road, taking Holly with him.  It's hard to tell what Holly's thinking just by looking at her face, but you figure she's thinking, ""Well, okay.""

Don't get me wrong, this isn't ""Natural Born Killers.""  God no.  God, no!!!!!  This is more like ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" except it's not even close to that either.

118727,4,0790737868,"Despite the standard disclaimer at the end of the credits, Badlands is a loosely camouflaged retelling of a 1958 killing spree across the western United States. I remember the events; they resonate more than half a century later, if only because back then there was still a general capacity for shock at the senseless rampage that killed ten, I think, people.  And, of course, the crime and, I imagine, Badlands impacted the young Bruce Springsteen as he was working on Nebraska.  Recalling the first lyric of that album, it is sublime to see Kit (Martin Sheen) get his first look at Holly (Sissy Spacek) as she is indeed standing twirling her baton.  It is also sublime to see how young and beautiful the two of them are.  At barely over 90 minutes, the film is the right length for the slow telling and loving long shots of open spaces that Malick makes his signature style.  My only quarrel with Badlands is its overt sympathy for Kit who is both a hot-blooded and cold-blooded killer, flattered to be told that he looks like James Dean.  Clint Eastwood must have liked Badlands too, for, having finally seen it after so long, I also saw a clear influence on Eastwood's A Perfect World from almost two decades later.

The very first murder taking place in a film about a killing spree was not exploited as what should have been an earth shattering moment for Holly. Badlands is loosely based on the ""Starkweather-Fugate"" killing spree of the 1950's. I know that in the medium of film things are romanticized. Even the worst situations look attractive to the viewer but the film gives the audience nothing to look at. Kit and Holly are painfully forgetable characters who coast through this film with a blase attitude. Kit just murders people left and right without batting an eye and Holly perfectly accepts what is occuring. What's even more infuritating is Holly's narration, which was unnecessary in general, was substituted for more crucial, emotional, character development. I was patiently awaiting for one of two moments; Kit, the violent sociopath who committed all the murders in the film, would finally unleash his fury on Holly or some sort of suspense in which the couple could be very well be killed by the authorties. Neither moment happened. Instead, Holly decided she just had enough and Kit simply turns himself into police custody. Again, neither person reacts to what was happening.

118733,5,0790737868,"To call `Badlands' a masterpiece may be an understatement.  To be honest, it is such an overwhelmingly good film that I don't really know what to label it.  It's a brilliant depiction of youth and celebrity and societal provocation.  What on the outset may appear like just another `killing-couple' film really proves to have the legs to carry it much farther than the genre typically allows.

Place this film next to `Bonnie and Clyde', `Thelma and Louise' and my personal favorite, `Perrot le Fou'.

`Badlands' was the directorial debut for famed director Terrence Malick.  Malick himself is a visionary filmmaker who stamps his breed of creative juice all over every picture he takes on (all four of them).  The man is somewhat of a cinematic enigma, but his crystal clear point of view makes films like `Badlands' so instantaneously admirable.

`Badlands', for me, is probably Malick's most intimate film.  That isn't to say that `Days of Heaven' or even `The New World' don't gather at their feet a layer of intimacy (and `The New World' truly tries harder than any of Malick's other films), but there is a natural intimacy captured within the fractured relaying of events caught on film here.  The gritty use of close-ups and stilled moments create something genuine within the characters on screen, and they latch themselves into the hearts of the audience, despite their atrocious acts of violence.

`Badlands' never condones, yet it never judges either.

The film is a fictionalized retelling of the true story involving a couple who murdered many in South Dakota during the late 50's.  In Malick's version, that couple is rebel Kit and the young and nave Holly.  Kit is quite a bit older than Holly, but she takes a liking to him and eventually allows him to date her despite her daddy's concerns.  When her father stands in the way of their bond, Kit kills him and then takes Holly on the run.  Their killing spree doesn't end their, in fact it continues on and on for quite some time, all the while the authorities and media are in a frenzy over the missing couple.

The films major statement is made in the climax, which carefully yet rather bluntly paints Kit to be a national celebrity.  It's a sick realization, but it is an astute one.  Now, this concept is not new to the movie-goer.  The idea that the media creates serial killers is not a new one, and it has been discussed time and time again.  What I loved so much about the way that `Badlands' handles the matter is that it really saves that assessment for last.  We are kind of blindsided by the general reaction to Kit, and his overall attitude towards his own crimes comes off like a major shock.

The real mystery here lies in the eyes of Holly; innocent bystander or malicious contributor?

The performances by both Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek are award worthy.  Spacek captures the characters ambiguity rather effortlessly, but for me it is definitely the James Dean-esque marvel that is Martin Sheen who takes the cake in the acting department.  It is such a layered performance, one that takes shape over time, revealing little bits of itself here and there before you understand the entirety of the man.

But like all of Malick's films, the actors are just another paint color with which he creates his of vision.  Malick is always the star of his own show.",1287705600,,3341,4.73356401384083

There is one scene in the film in which Sheen is peeking out of his underground hiding place that would not have seemed out of place in Apocalypse Now.

118735,5,0790737868,"I usually dislike films that tell terrible stories in a beautiful way, as if to glamorize the terror.  But this one grabbed me.  The cinematography is startlingly beautiful--there were scenes that almost made me gasp---especially the one of Sheen's head against the very blue sky at the moment he realizes he's going to be caught.

Beside the visual splendor, the acting is first rate.  I don't what Martin Sheen has....he's not that good looking, he's sort of short and not really hunky....But he has some quality that really impresses me.  I recently saw Apocolypse Now for the first time and he did the same thing.  At first I was put off by his ""more James Dean than James Dean"" style---especially his body movements in the beginning.  But then the urgency of his situation apparently scared him out of his need for style and he becamse an intensely interesting character.

When I was watching the film, I didn't know that it was based on real people. (There is a statement at the tne end disclaiming this.)  I'm glad I didn't because I totally accepted the characters that were presented on the film.  Some reviewers complain that the film tried to give the characters, especially the man, more depth than he could have had, by recording half-baked philosophies.  I hate to admit that I have met people something like this. They are scary because they really believe that they are deep thinkers and that their (sick) view of things justifies their actions. I imagine that jails and mental hospitals are full of them.

The girl is problemmatic, too, in her apparent lack of affect.  But, again, this is a 15 year old only child, who hasn't had a mother, whose father is no prize and this is 1959 in South Dakota where tv probably hasn't even hit yet.  I found her dilemma and her flat, almost numb narration very believable.

I liked this film better than Days of Heaven, probably due to the casting.  (although Sam Shepard was beautiful in the latter) It felt more complete and whole and resolved, unlike many other films that have shown horrific events that just leave you sitting there, sick.  (eg.  No Country for Old Men)

118739,4,0790737868,"""Badlands"" was released when I was 21 and I'm not sure why I never saw it until last night.  I recall a fair amount of controversy at the time of its' release in that it supposedly glorified senseless murder.  It does but so did ""Bonnie and Clyde""  I think movie critics were more in awe of Faye Dunnaway, Warren Beatty, and the Roaring 20's gangster genre in their reaction to ""Bonnie and Clyde"".  Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen were relative newcomers at the time and Terrence Malick making his directorial debut.  I recall a wide range of emotions in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" including humor (thanks in large part to Michael J. Pollard' one hit wonder preformance).  I did not see anything funny in ""Badlands"".  What surprised me was the total lack of meaningful emotion on the part of the two main characters.  We are led to like these two (I Think) yet we have trouble grasping their motivation.  The initial murder is enough to set the stage.  How that could have happened with so little meaningful reflection afterwards made me take a few steps back in my own emotional involvement.

The journey these two take was certainly not what I had expected.  The real-life characters (despite the standard disclaimer in the final credits) that these two were portraying were Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate.  The man(and woman)hunt for them was intensive and the image we had was that of desperate persons running out of control.  ""Badlands"" brings out the fear and uncertainty of the Central US but shows us a relaxed ""What do you wanna do now?"" couple who seem like their next stop would be an ice cream parlor.  I guess that this is part of the success of ""Badlands""; two people who can't see anything in the world except themselves and others who are out to hurt them.  Their innocence in how they deal with one another starkly (or starkweatherly) contrasts with how unemotionally they perceive everyone else.  For some that will be a comment on violence in the US, our inability to relate to one another in our society, or something of that sort.  Others will likely want to condemn these two to a lifetime in juvenile detention.  The final part of the film is either meant to endear us even more to the couple or to try and tell us that even evil people have their good days.  My own impression is probably still under construction but the blue prints tell me that this is a movie that is very well made and certainly worth watching so long as we appreciate the style rather than the substance.",1237075200,3,2502,4.617647058823529

118741,5,0790737868,"Made in the early 1970s, this was more of classic type crime story than a modern-day one in that the violence wasn't overdone and it was a slower-paced story than what you would see if re-made today.

That slower pace makes for a better study of the two main characters, who were based on the real-life serial-killing duo of the 1950s: Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend.

Martin Sheen's Starkweather-type character ""Kit Carruthers"" is amazingly low- key for a killer and Sissy Spacek, playing his girl, ""Holly,"" shows some really strange reactions (she hardly reacts after Sheen shoots her father) while providing fascinating narration. In fact, the more I watch this film, the more Spacek's narration is the highlight for me. It's great stuff.

Being a Terrence Malick-directed film, you know you are going to get some nice photography. He really loves closeups of nature. Another plus is the absence of profanity. There is very little of it.

But I figure enough people have given their reasons for liking or not liking the movie, so instead I'll throw out a couple thoughts upon watching it. For one, the couple is never in the actual Badlands of the Dakotas. They spend all their time on the Plains, unless I'm mistaken, whether it's the town they first live in, their holdout by the river, or their drive through the flat landscape. Badlands may be a purely metaphorical title, but the movie is actually set in a landscape more like that of Days of Heaven, if I'm remembering that movie right.

Also, I was struck by the plight of Kit's fellow trash collector, who's probably heard about Kit's mayhem, and is stuck on this isolated ranch house when he sees Kit show up brandishing his rifle. What terrible luck for him! This guy who happened to work alongside this asocial drifter now has only two options, try to take the gun from Kit or escape at the first opportunity he's got. Either way someone's going to get shot. Once Kit's picked up his gun and shot Holly's father, everyone he goes on to meet will be in mortal danger simply because Kit's so egotistical he'd rather kill people than run the risk they'll turn him. For me, the menace that floods the rest of the movie came from that fact, much like how watching No Country for Old Men I was constantly wondering who was going to die next.",1222128000,2,1459,4.526515151515151
118743,3,0790737868,"Badlands (Terrence Malick, 1973)

I've never understood the mystique attached to Terrence Malick. I assumed this was because the first Malick film I saw was his 1998 desecration of The Thin Red Line, to this day one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure to sit through in a theater. I figured that in order to give the guy a fighting chance, I'd go back and watch his earlier movies. Badlands was his first, and hey, Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek playing Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate? Okay, I'm sold. And it is certainly a much better film than The Thin Red Line, though I'm still not quite sure I've figured out the whole ""mystique"" bit.

The movie is a loose (very loose; everything from the names of the protagonists to the locations is changed-- Starkweather and Fugate never made it to Montana) adaptation of the Charles Starkweather story. Starkweather, here called Kit (Sheen), a garbageman, meets Fugate, erm, Holly (Spacek), a schoolgirl ten years younger than he. He falls in love with her. Her father (Warren Oates) is dead set against it, not because of the age difference-- Holly is only fourteen-- but because of the class difference. When Kit loses his job, he arrives to take Holly away with him so he can go find another one; after her father adamantly refuses to let her leave, Kit shoots him. Holly shows some emotion at this but not a great deal; she leaves with him, and the two travel from South Dakota to Montana, leaving a trail of bodies for which Kit has very easy explanations. After all, if he left anyone alive, they might tell the police where the young lovers (though how much love there is between them is always in question) are. They flee for Canada, an ever-growing legion of law enforcement officers on their back.

It's hard to deny the power of the source material; people have been wondering for decades what on earth possessed Caril Ann Fugate to tag along on Starkweather's killing spree (she claimed she was held hostage, but that never really rang true). And what Malick has done with it here is interesting. Spacek and Sheen are, of course, excellent actors almost every time they hit a screen, and the cinematography is fantastic, all the more so because it seems to have been done by committee (three cinematographers are named in the credits). Perhaps the faint dislike I felt of it simply stems from my dislike of The Thin Red Line, because, short of nitpickiness that's not really appropriate for such a fictionalized narrative of the events, I can't find any other reason for it. Still, I'm not entirely sure it deserves all the raves it's gotten, but that doesn't make it any less a good movie. ***",1209427200,10,2675,4.67515923566879
118744,5,0790737868,"Badlands is Terrence Malick's first feature film, and paved the way for his acclaimed career.  Badlands is a meditation on the relationship between 15 year old Holly and her older boyfriend, Kit as they go on a crime spree throughout the Midwest, leaving a number of bodies in their wake.  The film  has a relatively low budget aesthetic, but is very well shot and scored.  The performances from Sheen and Spacek are excellent, and contribute to the haunting nature of the film.  Although this movie is unconventional, it is very entertaining and easy to watch.  It is not a very difficult movie to comprehend, but it is a film that merits multiple viewings.",1198108800,2,658,4.778761061946903

118746,5,0790737868,"Loosely based on the 1958 Starkweather-Fugate murder spree that left 10 dead in Nebraska, Malick's astonishingly beautiful and accomplished debut marked him as a filmmaker with a unique artistic vision. With Spacek's matter-of-fact voiceover and deliriously gorgeous natural imagery to go alongside the fervid subject matter, ""Badlands"" was a pastoral renegade epic unlike any other. Spacek is alien-odd and eerily child-like as Holly, but Malick's ace in the hole is Sheen, whose simmering, cock-strutting portrayal of Kit has a strange beauty all its own.",1183420800,,557,5.642857142857143

Would have given it five stars, except I could have done without the voice-over narration by Sissy Spacek's character Holly.

Miss the late, great Warren Oates. Ramon Bieri excellent as ""Kit's"" trash picker-upper buddy.

118748,5,0790737868,"In 1958, a kill-happy Charlie Starkweather and his 13 year-old girlfriend Caril Ann Fugate came boiling out of high plains Nebraska to terrorize a section of the country that seldom appears on the 6 o'clock news. Behind, they left a trail of 11 dead bodies. If Charlie saw you, he killed you with no more thought than throwing away a gum wrapper. In the slumberland of 1950's suburbia, it was almost as if Beaver Cleaver had gone mad. So what  was the point of all the merciless blood-letting. Malick's terrific little movie makes the point that in fact there was no point. It really amounted to something to do. A way to escape a dead-end job with no prospects, no respect, and who knows, maybe other teen-agers would make a comparison with that reel rebel idol James Dean. In a bit of cultural perversity, it seems Starkweather succeeded. The night of his execution, young people gathered outside the prison gates to observe the morbid occasion. In his own way, he did make the movies, just like his idol.

This is a disturbing film that thoroughly deglamorizes the two fugitives and is a long, long way from Penn's ""Bonnie and Clyde"". Kit (Martin Sheen) and Holly (Sissy Spacek) are not just callow kids; they're dull, unimaginative, and barely aware of the gravity or consequences of what they do. Holly lives in a detached world, where her story-book narration contrasts vividly with the mayhem that surrounds them. She shows no tears or remorse for her slain father, creating instead little fantasies about a rollercoaster ride with a ""hell-bent type boy"". It's all really just a fairy-tale dream, after which she'll wake up and go to the prom. Boyfriend Kit Carruthers has all the moral sensibility of a happy-go-lucky clam. He kills because he really can't think of anything else to do. Besides, how else could such a hopeless dead-ender  become an outlaw legend in his own time, marking the spot of his capture with an improvised rock pile. There's absolutely nothing here to romanticize, and it's to Malick's credit that he doesn't.

Too bad Malick disappeared from movie-making. He had a rare alertness as to how the natural world shapes people's behavior. Here, Holly and Kit are adrift on the vast empty prairie of the horizonless Midwest (actually, southeastern Colorado). The dreary landscape stretches out to a nowhere that mirrors the fugitives' own inner emptiness and existential void. At least the act of fleeing provides proverbial ""meaning"" to an otherwise barren existence. There are many nice touches. Notice how Kit and Alan Vint's police deputy develop a budding friendship-- just a couple of good- ole'-boys who might have gone hunting together, except one of them doesn't shoot rabbits. In fact, the states of Nebraska and Wyoming treated the spree like a Soviet invasion, calling out the National Guard to reassure panicked civilians. Malick brings in the Guard formations casually and impressively at film's end, when the real impact trailing behind these two malt-shop fugitives is finally revealed. In 1958, wholesale killing was still the prerogative of adults only.

Over the years a number of films have been based on this mindless binge. In my book, Malick's remains the most compelling.",1172880000,3,3223,4.983271375464684
118749,5,0790737868,"Terence Malik inspired himself around a veridical story that took place in 1958, around the lives and times of Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend Caril Fugate (by the way, Fugate in Spanish means to escape) he was nineteen and she thirteen, to recreate a sensible and existential story about two misfits who just pretend from an oppressive environment, that became for them quite elusive, and the way approach their reality is like a dreamy world. Malik remarks it admirably through the brief dialogue between them when she talks him about the supposed affair between Sinatra and Hayworth, for instance to underline the state of boredom and lethargic era of the early sixties.

There are arresting images around this existential dramatis personae; both of them are true misfits he is an outlaw man and she is a motherless child who doesn't even know what she expects from life. But for better or worst that memorable sequence in which they dance at the rhythm of Nat King Cole's emblematic song whose lyrics seems to anticipate the obvious end is one the most mesmerizing and artistically well made sequences of the film.

A road-movie that may be result something slow paced for the actual generation of viewers, but that maintains the required specific weight to have become an instantaneous cult movie of the early seventies.",1172188800,,1333,5.0

118751,5,0790737868,"The power of this film--and it's a veritable knockout of a movie--is in this very coolness, this indifference, and the vacuity that's at the heart of the two characters and of everyone else in the movie (it's even at the heart of Malick's vision, apparently). It's hard to say how an empty, soulless vision of soulless emptiness could make a great film, but that's exactly what Badlands is. It's an enigma of a movie, something that defies categorization, or analysis, that simply is, like some curious freak of nature that seems both ugly and beautiful, depending on which way you look at it. Malick may be something of an enigma himself: a true auteur (he wrote the film also, though it's based on the true story of Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate) and a genuine visionary (the film both looks and feels like no other). Malick has only made two other films to date: the disappointing rural whimsy Days of Heaven, six years later, after which he disappeared into whatever void he had come out of, until 1998 and the disappointing, much-lauded The Thin Red Line. [1] Apparently he had better things to do than making movies, but his twenty-year absence added a certain extra something to the enigma of Badlands--which seems, like Malick himself, apparently, to not quite belong to the American cinema at all.

118752,5,0790737868,"This is one of my favorite movies.  It is immaculate: it does not have a single wasted second--it is tight and spellbinding.

The filmmakers have juxtaposed the tale of a horrific spree killing by a young and very likeable sociopath/psychopath/psychokiller, played brilliantly by Martin Sheen.  When we first meet him, he is a young, southern good ol' boy with a ton of grace and an equal measure of charm, tough, seemingly extremely self-assured, macho, self-reliant.  He just has this odd little quirk of blowing people away if they irritate him too much or if they get in his way, then stepping over their bodies, and proceeding to the next moment.  He is obviously ill educated, ignorant, and yet at some point we see that he has made the decision to carry himself with great pride, self-assurance, and masculinity, whatever his circumstances.

My favorite exposition of his personality is when he is finally arrested; he chats with the policeman as though they were just a bunch of good ol' boys sitting around a bar and he was buying drinks; just as cool as a cucumber, friendly, totally disingenuous.  Kind of ""What you see is what you get,"" now let's get on with it.  Not a hair out of place, not a tremor or tic to indicate rage, malice, or, dare I say it, evil.

Juxtaposed with him is Sissy Spacek's character, who is sweet, young, totally sheltered, dumb, and naive, but who also seems to have no trouble stepping over the bodies and putting her energy into staying alive and doing what she has to do to get through the moment.

Juxtaposed to that is the wonderful music--something like calliope music, sweet and dreamy.

And juxtaposed to that is the wonderful cinematography--shots of midwestern prairie, often flat, sometimes golden, never bleak.

It is totally mesmerizing and satisfying.  I hope I'm not the only one who could not be horrified by all the terrible bloodshed and murder--I'm passing the buck to this marvelous film, which gave us the story of mass murder in a balletic and fanciful context.",1158710400,2,2022,4.809248554913295
118753,5,0790737868,"Terrence Malick has acquired a tremendous cult following as an auteur, but this, his first film, is the only truly successful one among them--and is one of the finest films ever to attempt to capture the donwside of the American Dream (and to do it without pretentiousness). Although many films have been inspired by the notorious 1950s killing spree of Charlie Starkweather and Caril Fugate, from NATURAL BORN KILLERS to THE FRIGHTENERS, BADLANDS is really the only one to resonate--in part because it treats its Starkweather-Fugate analogues not as the quintessence of gleeful evil but rather as polite and disaffected, making their killing spree all the more astonishing. Kit Carruthers (Martin Sheen) is handsome, well spoken, and very gracious; he chastises himself when he speaks ungrammatically and records notes telling children very pietistic and typical homilies about playing fair and listening to minority opinions but acceding to the will of the majority. He shoots the father of his girlfriend Holly (Sissy Spacek) only when the man threatens to deny Kit what he feels is fairly his--Holly--, and thereafter he uses his gun as a means to rid himself simply of people who attempt to arrest him. It becomes basically an adolescent wish-fulfillment scenario. When Kit and Holly escape to the forest and build themselves an elaborate treehouse, they become like the Swiss Family Robinson or Huck and Joe on the raft escaping their pursuers. The cinematography of the film has been widely praised, as has its extremely inventive use of music (Carl Orff's ""Musica Poetica"" as well as songs by mickey and Sylvia and Nat 'King' Cole); Sheen and Spacek could hardly be improved upon in the central roles.",1151452800,6,1709,5.129032258064516

118755,5,0790737868,"Kit and Holly are presented in this story by Terrence Malick as total innocents, living in a  prelapsarian state, completely unaware of right and wrong, good and evil, and ignorant of guilt or sin. They have minimal conception of the consequences of their actions; in effect, they appear almost totally to lack imagination or foresight, and can barely empathise with each other, let alone other people. Things just happen, as Holly sees it. Kit doesn't feel hostility to the people he kills: they are merely in his way. There is no remorse. He is only marginally conscious that the structured world outside his own will eventually catch up with him. These  kids are like Adam and Eve, with a limited knowledge of what is forbidden, but no real knowledge of the meaning of life and death. Holly throws out her sick catfish, showing no feeling. Her dog is shot as a punishment by her father, indicating he, too, is careless of death or pain. Kit stands on a dead cow, as though puzzled by its absence of life. Neither of the two seems to cry or laugh much.  In one way these characters might also be thought of as throwbacks to a prehistoric, animalistic past,  where the younger man simply eliminates the older, in order to secure a mate for himself. Just the way of nature, and beyond criticism.  Apparently, so I've read somewhere, this is the mindset of the criminal, who cannot see what he is doing wrong. He has to get by, somehow, and takes the easiest path. Why work, when you can steal?  If obstacles arise, eliminate them. People are OK, otherwise. Live now, die later. This is an extraordinary film, superbly acted.",1139184000,67,1624,4.660839160839161
118756,4,0790737868,"I think this movie goes right to the heart of the philosophical question of what art and artists are supposed to be and do: are they merely to present facts/ideas/personalities/images with no comment, no moralizing, no personal ulterior motives (leaving all those things to the viewer), or do they need to state clearly a moral purpose and certain direction (which the viewer can then accept or reject)?

Martin Sheen is Kit, a garbageman working in South Dakota; he becomes friends with 15-year-old Holly (Sissy Spacek). When her father tells Sheen he doesn't want him near his daughter again, Sheen kills him. The two run off together, living for a while in the woods like two ""innocents"" of some primitive society. But then they're discovered by three men and Sheen kills them, too.

They now head for Montana, Sheen committing more murders along the way. He is empty inside, nothing fazes him; he imagines he's like James Dean - misunderstood, alienated. But he doesn't have a clue what he should be alienated against, and as far as being misunderstood, he never once gives the least hint there is anything there TO understand. We finish watching the movie feeling as empty as Sheen. I also felt a little angry at Malick's attempt to con me into thinking there is more to Sheen's vapid character than there really is: he truly is just a non-entity who kills half a score of innocent people.

So back to my first paragraph. Malick obviously works from the perspective of the first half of my question posed (a view that became an obsession, I think, with artists, writers, film-makers, etc. beginning in the late 1960s); I tend toward believing the second half. Suum cuique.",1129852800,10,1677,4.83623693379791
118757,5,0790737868,"Kit is a talkative loner, working as a garbage man in a small Oklahoma town. Having decided he's ""thrown enough garbage for one day,"" he slips off and heads, I suppose, for home. Along the way, he spies Holly, a young high school girl, twirling a baton in her front yard. Holly lives in a two-story Victorian with her widower father, who has never quite gotten over the loss of his wife nor ever loved his daughter half so well. Kit flirts with Holly and eventually persuades her to see him on the sly. But her father soon discovers their tryst and tells Kit he never wants to see him again. That same day, or a day later, Kit goes to Holly's home. She and her father are out. So he sneaks in and begins to pack her suitcase. Unfortunately, Holly and her father return to find Kit in her room--in a brilliantly shot sequence where we learn, in an actor's turn and in a turn of the camera, that we ought suddenly to be afraid. And before the father can leave to call the authorities, Kit shoots him. Then he and Holly set the house on fire, pack the car and set out on a road trip, inspired by the 1958 killing spree of Carl Starkwether and Carol Ann Fugate.

The film's narrative is initiated and regularly boosted by Holly's voice-over, read from her diary in a kind of alienated deadpan absurdity. It is the point where the characters marry with the modern. In an era of disconnectedness and alienation, teenagers often adopt a pose of world weariness when looking for their burgeoning social selves, somehow blind to the belligerent silliness of adopting such a pose after having actually known so little of the world. Kit and Holly live in a perpetual state of make-believe, circumscribed by their unknowing. They want to speak from some meaningful experience, but haven't any. So they borrow phrases and attitudes from books and magazines and movies but which, of course, are made absurdly comic when said in such soulless, humorless uncomprehending. Kit, for example, shoots Holly's father in a gesture that simply doesn't mean anything. It is but another unaffecting consequence of the pose. Moreover, as they ride away, he stops at the high school and sends her in to get her books so that she won't fall behind, as if the murder had been just another item, like any other item, on Kit's to-do list.

And all this is magically complicated by a wash of visual poetry over thoroughly unsettling circumstance--the hallmark, I think, of all three pictures that Terence Malik has written and directed. There is the sweet, childlike orchestration of Karl Orf's ""Musica Poetica"" that covers a montage of Kit and Holly literally at play. A flat, featureless landscape resembling the souls of its protagonists, a-glow in the orange and purple of the plain state's dawn and twilight. Nature is a great redeemer in Malik. A certain natural splendor will always be, will persist, in a world that occasionally wears the stain of humanity. And there is an odd moment as they are racing in the dead of night across the badlands towards a mountain they had earlier seen in the blue fade of aerial perspective. A song begins to play on the radio. Holly reaches to turn it off, or over, but Kit suddenly pushes her hand away, breaks in a smile and identifies the singer as Nat King Cole. They stop the car. And in the utter black of the city-less plains, they slow dance to the music in the bleach of the headlights.",1112745600,4,3406,4.618811881188119

118759,5,0790737868,"Perhaps the most nave Sissy ever - her character, Holly, is a blank slate with no past and no future. Like a pubescent Bonnie Parker waiting for her Clyde, Holly is swept away by the expansive charms of Kit Carruthers - but she could have just as easily been swept away by a toy or a new dress. Like a talking parrot regurgitating the Tao of Kit, Holly is deeply impressed by the attention her new boyfriend is giving her. Sissy adds a plaintiveness to Holly that creates sympathy for her - and she needs all the sympathy she can get. She is a disassociated and disturbed young woman who virtually stands around while Kit murders her father in front of her, and then burns the house down. The fire sequence is a masterpiece of filmmaking, and it is evident that the house is not the only thing being destroyed. And the pair is off on a spree of senseless killings. Kit is the triggerman, but Holly's guilt in the crimes is not only by association, it is by omission - it is what she does *not* do that makes the crimes so horrific. The cinematography is breathtaking. As lusciously beautiful as Malik's *The Thin Red Line*, but without the pretense, we are awed by visions of purple mountains' majesty, and close ups so tight you can almost see the leaves changing color. The forest that shelters their primitive hideaway comes alive when they are invaded, seeming to whisper its urgent warnings. Winning many European awards, including British Academy Award for Best Newcomer for Sissy, *Badlands* continues to cast a strong spell.",1106438400,10,1532,4.636029411764706
118760,5,0790737868,"`In 1959 a lot of people were killing time. Kit and Holly were killing people.'  That's the tagline for Badlands (1973), a film loosely based on the true life events surrounding the 1958 killing spree by Nebraska couple Charlie Starkweather and his jailbait girlfriend Caril Fugate.  The film, written and directed by Terrence Malick (The Thin Red Line), stars Martin Sheen (Apocalypse Now, The Dead Zone) and Sissy Spacek (Carrie, Coal Miner's Daughter) in her first, prominent silver screen role.  Also appearing is Warren `Quaker' Oates (The Brink's Job).

As the film, set in South Dakota, begins, we meet Kit Carruthers (Sheen), a directionless 25-year-old man working the crummy odd job or two, looking very much like James Dean in his blue jeans, white t-shirt, and cowboy boots.  After a chance meeting with nave, 15-year-old Holly Sargis (Spacek), the two hit it off and begin dating, but soon Holly's father (Oates) finds out, and puts the kibosh on the May-December romance, instructing Kit to hit the bricks, never to darken their doorstep again, or some such thing...Kit seems amicable about the situation, that is until he shows up later at the Sargis house, collecting Holly, and shooting her father (in her presence, mind you).  He makes apparent efforts to cover the crime in burning the house to the ground, but purposely leaves behind an admission of what happened...Kit and Holly take to the road, making residence in some nearby woods (in a treehouse, no less), but are soon confronted by the law which sets off a murderous trek across the badlands of South Dakota and Montana.  Along the way they meet some new and interesting people, and kill them (well, Kit does, as he's got the guns), continuously on the move, with the ever present spectre of law enforcement looming somewhere on the horizon.  Capture seems imminent, but the question becomes will it be a peaceful or violent one (actually, the film raises much more in-depth questions regarding the alienation of disaffected youth, and a society that condemns, but also celebrates, the criminal element, rather than this quite obvious one)?

In the mid to late 50's, youthful rebellion was in the air, marked with the emergence of rock and roll, Elvis Presley, and James Dean.  Films like The Wild One and Rebel Without a Cause served to stir up not only the young people, who identified with the restlessness and discontentment often portrayed within these films, but also resonated with the older generation, basically scaring the pants off them, as they saw these elements infringing on their precious status quo.  I think it's important to keep this in mind watching the film, as it served to magnify Kit and Holly's actions (much more, I think, in the real life case of Starkweather and Fugate), as now this perceived, growing threat to the establishment had gotten its' poster children.  While watching Badlands, I couldn't help notice how much it had in common to Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994), also how much it didn't.  Both share the same, core elements of youth gone wild, but where Natural Born Killers thrived on spectacularly gaudy and garish visuals, wallowing in its' own, pretentious crapulence (my opinion), Badlands is completely opposite, presenting the material in a modest, unassuming, and very natural way, choosing not to glorify the visceral, but embracing the ambiguous relationship of society and its' fascination with those who conform to their own, often indefinable, social mores.  I thought Sheen did a superior job with his character of Kit, infusing him with charm and the general feeling that you want to like him, even despite his crimes and seemingly cool disinterest towards life in general (well, at least towards those who would stand in the way of what he wanted at that specific moment).  It was kinda strange to find myself identifying with a character on some level, and then he goes off and shoots someone, reminding me of his unpredictable nature.  I also thought Spacek was wonderful, and I found her character of Holly to be just a bit more scary than that of Kit.  She's along for the ride, witnessing these horrific events (the violence is extremely toned down throughout the film, the focus being on the characters themselves), and yet, seems to show little, if any, real concern or emotion, but then I felt like maybe she was in a continual state of shock since her father's death.  She provides narration through much of the film, giving an odd, detached, sometimes disconcerting, perspective on the events that transpire, generally focusing more on the trivial rather than the gruesomely obvious.  Two other elements worth mentioning is the photography and the music.  Many of the scenes feature beautiful vistas, sometimes shot during the most dramatic parts of the day, either at dawn or dusk, creating a odd sort of sensation of creatures floating in the ether between realms...I know that sounds weird, but I am at a lack to describe it any other way.  As far as the music, I could swear some of it was later used in Quentin Tarantino's 1993 film True Romance...regardless, the music is perfectly suited for the film, not overshadowing the events on the screen, but perfectly accompanying them, as if it was an natural extension of the film, rather than something added after the fact.

The picture on this Warner Brothers DVD release (it has both the widescreen 1.85:1 and pan & scan formats) looks reasonably well, but does show some very minor signs of age.  The soundtrack claims to be `remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1' and does sound alright, but I did have to utilize the English subtitles on occasion to understand some of the dialog.  There are no special features, not even a trailer, but I didn't mind too much as I found the film in and of itself to be worth the price I paid.

118761,5,0790737868,"Terrence Malick's first film (of his extremely sparse filmography) is his best so far: a stark road movie/crime film/strange romance featuring superb photography and two superb performances from emerging young actors Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen. It's a chilly journey through middle-America that has a strangely affecting emotional power despite its grim story line. Malick, who also wrote and produced the movie, turns the Midwest into an strange fairytale world where civilization has almost vanished.

Based on a 1958 killing spree by Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate, Malick's film (he also wrote and produced it) takes place in 1959 and follows Kit Carruthers, a twenty-five-year-old killer, on the run with his fifteen-year-old girlfriend Holly (Spacek). As they travel ever more north across the least populated stretch of the U.S. imaginable, Kit leaves more bodies behind and Holly starts to wonder about their eventual fate and if she wants to be part of it. Kit, although a murderer with detestable motivations for his killings, has an immense likability and it's easy to see why Holly falls so strongly for him. She mentions that he is something like James Dean, and the comparison is appropriate: with his casual strut and smooth charm, Martin Sheen almost seems like James Dean re-incarnated. Since the story is seen through Holly's eyes (her voiceover serves as ironic commentary on events), it's easy to want to see Kit succeed in his escape from the consequences of his killings -- even though we know this is impossible. Spacek again shows that during the 1970s she was one of the best actresses around for portraying young, unsure teenagers. She projects a complete, delicate naturalness in her performance, and along with ""Carrie"" this ranks as her best role.

Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't do full justice to this excellent movie. The presentation is only adequate. The image is presented in 1.85 widescreen enhanced for 16:9 televisions, but the picture quality has quite a lot of scratches and grain in many places. This is particularly distracting during the many wide vistas of open blue sky that establish the look of the movie. The transfer won't ruin your enjoyment of the film, but a movie of this beauty should really have the cleanest transfer possible. The sound comes only in a 5.1 mix, which basically means there's a bit of sound echo placed on the rear speakers; nothing impressive. It's better to listen to the film through a basic surround sound or stereo effect than 5.1. There are no bonus features, not even a trailer, but considering Malick's dislike of publicity (he wouldn't even let anyone publish new photos of him during the filming of ""The Thin Red Line"") this is just what you would expect.",1103673600,4,2747,5.061810154525387
118762,4,0790737868,"This movie is captivating as it tells the tale of 2 young people who are strangers and outcasts in their own world.  Sheen and Spacek very adequately and eerily portray a couple on the run from the law.

The story follows the real life people and most horrific events that took place with Charlie Starkweather and Carol Fugate.  They are much like Bonnie and Clyde, only they are not necessarily on a quest for money.  Mostly, their main goal starts out to be to mainly get away to a better place where they can freely do what they want.  In order to do this though, Kit has to leave no witnesses, no matter who it is.

Kit (Sheen) kills once and then it just becomes easier after that.  Holly ( Spacek)is very devoted and stays with him throughout all the killings.  She is regretful that her dad is killed, but even at that, shows little emotion.

Sheen has eyes that seem to be wild and focused only on who the next victim will be.

He claims he loves Holly his girlfriend, when actually he only uses her for a partner in crime and for sex.

Spacek even though she witnesses everything, she doesn't run away.

I 've watched the real bio. about Starkweather and Fugate.  I also watched a more true-to-life version featuring Tim Roth.  I like the Tim Roth version best, perhaps because they portray the characters and events very closely as to how it really happened.

When her father (Warren Oates) stands in their way, Kit kills him and hits the road with Holly, who thinks she is in love with him.  They hide out in the wilderness for awhile, and then go on the run, killing several people along the way.

Director/screenwriter Terence Malick has given us characters that are emotionally barren, as reflected by the barren landscapes of North Dakota.  They occasionally seem happy together, but most of the time they seem emotionally flat and detached from their own feelings; Holly seems as if she is in a constant state of shock.  Malick's style is almost like that of a documentary, presenting the events and trusting us to draw our own conclusions.  Sheen and Spacek, both at the beginnings of their careers, show a great deal of talent./",1090108800,4,928,4.8789808917197455
118764,5,0790737868,"Brilliantly directed by Terrence Malik who also wrote the screenplay, this film examines the tragic partnership of Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate. Their counterparts are Kit (Sheen) and Holly (Spacek) whom Malik neither idealizes nor condemns. Rather, using many of the devices of a documentary, he invites us to accompany Kit and Holly as they meet, team up, and then travel along a blood-soaked journey to what seems to be an inevitable and appropriate fate. Of special interest to me is their response to celebrity status as highly publicized killers. Neither seems to understand, at least fully, the attention they attract nor the implications of their behavior but both seem energized by the ""excitement"" they generate.
The acting throughout the film is outstanding as is the cinematography which juxtaposes the violence with the banality of the two fugitives' lifestyle. (Several scenes remind me of Travis Bickel in Taxi Driver who also seems almost totally out of touch with the reality of his circumstances.) The highly impressionable as well as delusional Holly, an insecure teenager vulnerable to co-dependency, is the more sympathetic of the two. As indicated earlier, Malik is non-judgmental as he examines the two ""star cross'd lovers."" When seeing this film again recently, I was again struck by the fact that seemingly ordinary people can become so dangerous, sometimes for reasons which neither they nor we can explain. How many Kits and Hollys are out there today, together or alone, resembling time bombs which could detonate at any time, anywhere? For me, that is the most chilling implication of this unique film.
I thoroughly enjoy discussing with other film buffs certain similarities and differences between and among a group of films, especially when several decades separate one from others, thus suggesting it may have been influenced one or more of them. (It is probably impossible to calculate the number of films influenced by Citizen Kane.) Badlands (1973) is a case in point, inviting comparisons with predecessors such as High Sierra (1941), They Live by Night(1949), and Bonnie and Clyde(1967) as well as with subsequent films such as The Sugarland Expressand Thieves Like Us (1974), Kalifornia(1993), Natural Born Killers(1994), and A Boy Called Hate (1995).",1086220800,2,2300,5.304109589041096
118765,4,0790737868,"Okay, just for the easily shocked: this movie is about serial killers who are good-looking, charming, and delusional. One is a fifteen-year-old girl who is infatuated with a twentysomething sociopath named Kit. From the beginning of the movie, the audience can hardly blame a young, motherless outcast of a girl for falling under the spell of Kit, who is young, good-looking, and looks remarkably just like James Dean. So what if he's a garbage collector? When you're fifteen and an older boy is paying attention to you, that hardly matters. Such is the case of our protagonist. Watching this movie, it's hard to decide what makes the movie so enthralling: our male lead, who is clearly mentally ill; our female lead, who is clearly too immature to deal with her boyfriend; or the gorgeous scenery of the Midwest. Terrence Malick made a movie that is both stark and gorgeous, both fascinating and repulsive. He uses music only when it is appropriate to the scene, and the music that he does use is powerful. Like any great artist, Malick knows his craft. I have never seen Martin Sheen handsomer or more convincing. He is able to portray Kit in a way that evokes sympathy and disgust, a rare feat for any actor. Sissy Spacek is wide-eyed and lovely, and this movie hints at her glorious career to come. This is not a movie to watch when you need something uplifting or reassuring, it is far too dark. But Badlands makes for an important commentary on the uniquely American serial killer. It also comments on teenage infatuation, growing up (or the refusal to do so), insanity, and the nature of crime. Malick always leaves enough to the audience's interpretation that we don't feel we're being preached to; however, he gives us enough visual clues and stimulating dialogue to let us come to our own conclusions.",1081209600,5,1811,4.789137380191693
118766,1,0790737868,"As with all Malick films, he enjoys potraying the stupid as intellegiant; as victims, of the banality of life. The live based on emotions, well so do, dogs and cats.
Martin Sheen's character shoots people in the back, and reasons, that their motives are wrong because they are ""bounty hunters"".
Listening to the moronic Sissy Spacec character's narration is almost unbearbable.
But as with any sociopathic characters that are potrayed in the movies, both of the murderers in ""Badlands"" are extremely good looking.
Which makes his next project of the murderous and good looking Che, seem appropriate.",1079308800,13,599,5.185567010309279
118767,5,0790737868,"This is a film with a skewed perspective.  Both main characters, played brilliantly by Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen are on the run for murder; they are in love, and both dwell in their own fantasy-lands far from any normal idea of reality.  Believe it or not, the title phrase that I used here sums up this movie completely.  Let me put it into its context.  Martin Sheen's character, ""Kit,"" drags his first murder victim down into the cellar of the house and while there he glances around, then grabs the first thing he sees and returns upstairs.  Upon his arrival he says, ""I found this toaster.""  He then places it on the counter like he just discovered The Holy Grail.  His character's utter detachment from what he's just done is both creepy and morbidly hilarious.  I once heard something in a movie that I will relate here: A genius tends to create his own Moral Universe.  I believe that, but I also believe the opposite to be equally true.  Apparently, the same idea holds true for socio-pathic, psychotic morons.  These characters are so lost in their own personal ""Wonderlands"" that they create their own set of emotions, remorse not being on their very short list.  Martin Sheen is the heart of the film, and dominates every scene he is in.  However, Sissy Spacek plays the perfect foil to ""Kit"" and his left-of-center view of life.  Her cold and submissive performance is echoed in the objective narration of the film, where she accepts what is happening at all costs because ""Love"" can't be wrong.  What was especially unnerving for me was that I couldn't help but be charmed by these two very disturbed young people.  They have an endearing quality that comes, I think, from their child-like perspective of the world.  Everything is seen in simple terms, without any complexity of emotion.  This film is a strange adventure about two very strange characters.  What makes this story all the more compelling is that it is based on actual events.  This is the first film from acclaimed director Terrence Malick, and my personal favorite of his from his small, 3-film catalog.  His other films are ""Days of Heaven"" and his remake of the classic film ""The Thin Red Line.""  Another film with the same ambience as ""Badlands"" is ""At Close Range"" which was released in 1986, and stars Sean Penn, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Christopher Walken. Both films are worth owning.

118768,5,0790737868,"Being a movie buff, ""Badlands"" has been a long kept secret from me until someone recently recommended it to me. From the first few minutes of the movie, I was drawn into the story and cared about the characters. As the film unfolded, I became mesmerized by the beautiful and interesting cinematography. Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek gave brilliant and realistic performances. Even, the music was great. It is hard to imagine it was Terrence Malick's first film. I won't go into the plot because you could read that on any of the other reviews on this page but will say that it is a story of two alienated lovers who go on an unexpected killing spree. While most films show killers as ""evil"" and ""bad,"" ""Badlands"" focuses on the human qualities and emotions of the characters, showing them neither as good or bad but as who they really are. ""Badlands"" is a great film in every aspect and essential viewing to anyone who likes good movies.",1070668800,3,937,4.616766467065868

118771,5,0790737868,"Those of us old enough to remember the real-life crime spree of Charles Starkweather and his companion Caril Fugate in 1958 watched the tragedy unfolding while wondering what was going through the minds of these two at the time.  Were their victims even people to them, or just opportunities along the way to wherever?  Terrence Malick's profoundly accomplished and disturbing film ""Badlands"" based on the Starkweather-Fugate rampage through South Dakota, takes us inside the minds and souls of Kit, a 25 year old ne'er-do-well, and Holly, a 15 year old on the social margins despite her middle-class lifestyle, and we find that while these two may have had intelligence enough, there was a conspicuous absence where their souls should have been.
Holly is a social loner, a wannabe cheerleader, who Kit spies practicing on her lawn.  It's love at first sight for him; what is it for her?  Love, fascination... we can't tell.  There's so much about Holly that's missing.  Her mother is dead, her father cares about her but his insensitivity is appalling, and Holly herself doesn't seem connected to anything or anyone.  Holly's father knows from the outset that Kit is bad news and he doesn't want him messing with his daughter, so when Kit and Dad go head to head and Dad ends up dead; Holly's reaction shows all the vacuousness of her soulless existence.  Is this girl really evil or is she just not there?
On the run across the Badlands of South Dakota, Kit and Holly claim more victims.  Holly never does the actual killing, but she never tries to intervene.  Kit will shoot down anyone with less trepidation than he would step on a bug, but how does Holly feel about this?  Can she feel anything?  Even her affection for Kit seems lukewarm.  Holly just isn't there.
Malick does a superb job in showing how the badlands inside Kit and Holly match the Badlands of their environment.  These two are a study in nothingness.  Kit bounces from job to job with nothing to show for it, and Holly... it's tempting to say she just doesn't give a damn, but we never know where she's coming from.  There's a very dark night inside Kit's soul but Holly doesn't even seem to have a soul, and in that sense, she's even more disturbing than he is.
The actors are superb.  Martin Sheen makes Kit sensual, likeable and at the same time totally amoral; Sissy Spacek is eerily convincing as Holly, and Warren Oates is excellent as her loutish father and the lesser actors.  At the end of ""Badlands"" we realize the futility of the lives of these two young people, and an emptiness inside them that is matches the stark barrenness of the world they live in.",1046563200,4,2639,4.68763557483731
118772,5,0790737868,"This is an amazing directorial debut, as the film works on so many fronts. It is both a love story and a crime drama, with sneak peaks at what makes the two main protagonists tick. It remains for the audience to decide who is the more chilling and disturbed of the two characters, twenty five year old Kit (Martin Sheen) or fifteen year old Holly (Sissy Spacek).
This is a film in which two unlikely characters become lovers. Kit, a James Dean-like loser espies the fresh-faced Holly twirling her baton one day and is smitten. He approaches her and, despite her initial reluctance, she begins to see him against her protective father's wishes. Kit is ten years older than Holly, a high school drop out from the wrong side of the tracks, who is unable to maintain a job and appears to have a limited future. He falls in love with Holly and wants her to be his exclusively. Eventually, they become lovers.
Holly, a loner who has been raised by her father since her mother died many years ago, lives a middle class, materially comfortable existence. Her father, while he no doubt loves and cares for her, lacks a certain sensitivity. His idea of punishing Holly for disobeying him is to shoot her dog in cold blood. When her fish is dying, his solution is to toss it into the yard while it is still gasping for breath, replacing it with a new fish. Holly's naive, fresh-faced, freckled countenance belies a soul that has atrophied. It is as if Holly were disconnected from her feelings.
When Kit tries to talk to the father about his feelings for Holly, he is told in no uncertain terms to hit the road. Kit then decides to leave and take Holly with him. Kit enters Holly's house one day, packing a suitcase of her things in anticipation of their departure, when Holly and her father unexpectedly arrive home. Kit and Holly's father have a confrontation, that ends badly for dear old dad. It is here that the film first signals Holly's detachment as being something other than naivete. Her reaction is mind boggling. It is even more horrific than Kit's reaction. Or is it just shock? You be the judge.
They initially live an almost Thoreauesque existence in the woods, living off the land, reading, and spending lots of quality time together, until this, too, begins to pall. Discovery of their idyll by law enforcement officers drives them out, and they begin a chilling killing spree across the Badlands of South Dakota and a life on the lam.
While it is Kit who does all the actual killing, it is, to my mind, Holly who is the more complex and frightening character. Her prosaic and banal conversation, as well as a lack of empathy in the most heinous and disturbing of circumstances, is most unsettling. This is reinforced in the film through a voiced-over, almost toneless, detached narration by Holly of the events that took place. It is a masterpiece of point and counterpoint, chilling in its very telling and understated irony. When they are eventually caught, Holly remains impassive, while Kit relishes his celebrity and oozes charm, winning over his captors. Martin Sheen's performance is nothing short of brilliant, while Sissy Spacek is mesmerizing with her ability to chill the viewer.
This is an expertly crafted film with an ingenious use of music. The director even manages to utilize the music of Erik Satie (Gymnopedies 3) most effectively, however unlikely it may seem. Like the music of Erik Satie, the film is multi-textured and deceptively complex. Bravo!",1045612800,63,3476,4.747107438016529

The worst scene is where the two young lovers kill their friends for no apparent reason. The eerie music and Spacek's narration also lend another dimension to the tragic tale, making it a type of psychological study of innocence turned evil. Perhaps Bruce Springsteen says it best in his song Nebraska of which I quote a part of the lyrics:
""I saw her standin' on her front lawn just twirlin' her baton
Me and her went for a ride sir and ten innocent people died
From the town of Lincoln Nebraska with a sawed off .410 on my lap
Through to the badlands of Wyoming I killed everything in my path
Sheriff when the man pulls that switch sir and snaps my poor head back
You make sure my pretty baby is sittin' right there on my lap
They declared me unfit to live said into that great void my soul'd be hurled
They wanted to know why I did what I did
Well sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world.""",1029974400,,1031,4.26530612244898
118774,5,0790737868,"I have one resolution: if I should ever hit the Big Game lottery jackpot and walk away with a cool hundred million or so, I'm calling Terrence Malick (assuming I can get his phone number -- I may have to resort to smoke signals or Batman's bat-beam) and telling him his next movie is on me. Carte blanche. Whatever he wants. Because I know that whatever idea consumes him so much as to drive him to commit it to film, it is something I, too, must share. We live in an age so bombarded by information, what it takes to sustain our collective attention span has the half-life of a snowball in July. But I have faith in Terrence Malick that whatever message he brings will be not only artistic and well-realized, but will endure.
 The ""myth"" of Terrence Malick has somewhat unfairly obscured what is so magical and remarkable about his work. Malick's films are not revered because he is reclusive. They are admired because they recreate our world as a lush and often dreamlike pastoral garden in which the evils of our complex world are simplified and supplied with an unbroken commentary on our human condition. Malick is reclusive because he steadfastly refuses to make movies the center of his life. They are merely another way of expressing a part of what he thinks. The need for celebrity (an artifice that eclipses personal identity) which he so scrupulously rejects, is the same corrupting need for recognition that sends Kit on his murderous killing spree.
 ""Badlands"" is as important today as when it was released in 1973. More so. It is a meditation on how the public's fascination with what it cannot grasp -- anything that refuses to accept the limits of convention -- creates celebrity, even going so far as to allow it to worship and romanticize evil. This is not unique to American culture but is certainly one of its hallmarks. Jesse James, Billy the Kid and Bonnie and Clyde are still heroes to some because they rebelled against a monolithic culture which threatens to suppress individual identity.
 Kit (Martin Sheen) attempts to carve out an identity for himself in his relationship with the underage Holly (Sissy Spacek). When they first make love (an event which impresses him more than her) he suggests they memorialize the moment by crushing each other's hand with a rock. When she rejects the impracticality of the notion (it would hurt), he amends his proposal by suggesting they carry the rock along with them forever. She thinks this equally absurd. He then substitutes a tiny rock, easier to carry. Finally bored with it all, he throws it away, too.
 The victims Kit leaves in the wake of his violent killing spree are as disposable as the rock. Their deaths are but fleeting memorials to an empty life which is itself defined by these empty acts of violence. Kit wants immortality but is mezmerized by the moment. When the moment is past, however, he finds it boring and empty. Such is the way we look at our own present-day disposable culture.
 I love Terrence Malick because he creates movies that ask you to do two simple things. First, he asks you to feel, then he asks you to think. The movie's blend of lush photography and sensuous music combines with a lyrical narrative that casts Holly's naivete in counterpoint to Kit's violent instability. All of this evokes a mythic and mystical portrait of the American Badlands -- our own heart of darkness -- wrapped in a simple and twisted love story.",1019174400,5,3429,4.7274247491638794
118775,3,0790737868,"""Badlands"" is easier to respect than to like or enjoy. As a debut film, it's certainly remarkable, the more so since virtually every aspect of director Terrence Malick's mature style--the lush photography, the intercut images of nature around the central story, the use of voice-over to fill in gaps of motivation in bland, affectless characters--is present from the beginning. It's a rare American film that is so rigorously of a piece, and rarer still for a contemporary filmmaker to trust his audience to respond to his vision for its own sake.
That said, ""Badlands"" is not terribly memorable. I bought it after being stunned by ""The Thin Red Line"" and feeling that it might be worth a second viewing. (I first saw it in college in the 1970s.) I was struck by how little of it I remembered. Usually films this distinctive leave at least a trace with me--the odd bit of dialogue or behavior here, the haunting, inexplicably moving image there. Nothing about ""Badlands"" had stuck with me beyond the barest outlines of the story. Indeed, the familiarity of Malick's style works against the film as much as for it. After ""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line,"" I couldn't help feeling that the director's artful touches were a touch tired and repetitive. Only Sissy Spacek's performance as the nearly comatose 15 year old Holly stays with you. Spacek was 23 when ""Badlands"" was made, but she's utterly convincing as a baton twirling, teenage cipher. Martin Sheen is competent as Kit, but like most of Sheen's performances, there seems to be something basic lacking.
Like the film itself, Sheen's Kit is all of a piece, you can't really criticize his performance, but he never engages the imagination, he's never believeable as someone who could indulge in this level of violence. The rest of the actors might as well be drugged. There's no tension or fear in any of their reactions; in fact, they barely react at all.
Nothing spills over. Everything is smooth, clean and refined, but the cumulative effect of all this polish is as dry and bare as the ""Badlands"" themselves. While that may be intentional, it doesn't make for very spirited viewing. You're likely to feel as indifferent to ""Badlands"" as the characters are to life. Elegant understatement is certainly nothing to dismiss, especially in American films, but when the precision and artistry are dedicated to demonstrating life's emptiness, it's perverse. I wanted to ask the Texas-born Malick, ""If life on the Plains makes you this numb, where did you ever get the motivation to become a filmmaker?""",1000857600,7,2561,4.916859122401847
118776,3,0790737868,"'Badlands' is an interesting picture that has similarities with a number of other flicks (both before and after) such as 'Bonnie & Clyde', 'Taxi Driver' and 'Natural Born Killers'. Like Jodie Foster in Scorcese's 'Taxi Driver', 'Badlands' has Sissy Spacek as a child thrown into the realities of adulthood and human depravity before her time. Malick constantly juxtaposes images of childhood and innocence alongside the world of murder and violence with which Spacek finds herself suddenly involved. Sheen is the anti-hero along the lines of De Niro's Travis Bickle (was that before or after? Possibly after), a gun-wielding youth who finds himself hailed as something of a hero when the police finally catch up with him. So, we find the director raising questions about the glorification of violence and the twisted values of popular culture. Left me with the same bitter taste in my mouth that I had after watching 'Taxi Driver'.",997315200,,931,5.131578947368421

His script is fantastic and this leads to a smart, almost surreal look into the lives of two young lovers, ten years separating them on the run.  Second step, present a fantastic and beautiful visual world--Malick is the best at.

Malick of course, in all of his movies never makes judgements against Kit but he does introduce voice over or dialogue where Kit makes a few judgements of himself.  I think one of the best moments of the whole movie is at the end when Kit looks over at Holly lovingly and says, ""I'm sorry about your dad.""  This is where it all began and has ended with the same sentiment.  What a gift of storytelling from one of the greatest directors of all time.
BADLANDS, similar to Kazan's A FACE IN THE CROWD deals with the bizarre concept of the celebrity which is maybe a reason why Malick is so recluse.  Here's to Terrence Malick, a scholar, a storyteller, and a visionary.",993427200,2,1159,4.647058823529412
118778,5,0790737868,"Mallick (director) sets the story of teen angst vs the rest of the world, in mind numbing mid west 1950's America. Martin Sheen's character(Kit) punctures the slumber with the bursting force of youth. He plays a down at heel garbage collector who falls in love with a prissy, naive schoolgirl, Holly(Sissy Spacek). Kit accepts no resistance to his grasp for life and executes Holly's father at the faintest expression of question.
The dye is cast, bridges are burned and there follows... chilling murders in which friends, strangers and hapless bystanders are caught up. The couple flee to the Badlands of America's central Mid West. Amidst eerie and hypnotic scenery and with a poignant and beautiful soundtrack Spacek narrates a diary which heightens the melancholy and futiity of their struggle. As the forces of law and order close in Sheen strangles any hope of reconciliation and shows us a rebel with out a cause, who laughs at the irony of his own predicament and ultimately accepts his self made fate, mocking bravado and hero status....",984009600,3,1046,5.017241379310345
118779,3,0790737868,Martin Sheen in one of his most profound roles & Sissy Spacek play Kit & Holly two young lovers who lead a pusuit with the cops during a wild killing spree througout the midwest. Holly who is only fiftteen years old is consumed with fasination with her older boyfriend that she doesn`t realize he`s an unstable homicidel manic until halfway through the film. Even though the film is filled with teriffic acting from it`s stars and has amazing scenery of La Junta Valley in Colarado the film moves too slow and the viewer is caught up in the prolonging melodrama and by the time the film has reached its inevitable conclusion the viewer is already asleep. This film still remains a classic showing of the American Dream gone bad and where young innocence is shatterd & destroyed by the viloent circumstances of human nature.,979689600,2,823,4.722222222222222
118780,5,0790737868,"As a Movie: ""Badlands"" is durn-near-perfect.  It contains first-rate acting, direction, and plot. The plot is based loosely on the Starkweather murders of the 50's, with Martin Sheen as a sociopathic kid  with James-Deanian charisma, and Sissy Spacek as his jailbait muse. Sheen  seduces the bored, well-to-do pubescent, kills her father, and takes her  (willingly) on the lam. The plot is well-suited to the 70's style of  filmmaking: string a bunch of vignettes together and hope your actors  inhabit the roles consistently enough to make the movie cohere. Sheen is  manic, feeding off of his love for Spacek, while Spacek seems to be  following along as if she has nothing better to do. Both actors are  shockingly blase about the increasing number of murders  ""necessary"" to keep themselves out of handcuffs.
Malick's  direction is deliciously slow. Long, languorous takes with few edits. Lots  of artistic cutaways to rustling leaves (my favorite: a cut to a trapped  chicken for no apparent reason), or the looong prairie. This makes you  experience how the characters must feel -- that they're alone in a world  living at their own pace.
As a DVD: I wasn't paying much attention to  grain, jumps, or other such videophilia. What I *can* say is that it's a  pretty nice transfer according to my eye. It's widescreen, so you can  appreciate Malick's framing in full splendor. Extras are slim to none, but  I think this is one of those films where extra information is at best  unnecessary, and at worst damaging to the feel of the film.
Because of  the nonlinear plot and first-rate acting, I suspect this movie would stand  up to many repeated viewings. I'd say it's worth buying.",963964800,5,1686,4.904255319148936
118781,5,0790737868,"The first time I saw this film was on video. Before the film was the theatrical trailer. It started with a balloon floating above a barren landscape. A voice-over tells us that the young couple of the film are Kit  and Holly. In 1950 they killed a lot of people. The balloon bursts to  reveal the title ""Badlands"". This is effortlessly cool, it hasn't  dated a bit. The amount Tarantino ""borrowed"" from this film is  unbelievable, Hanz Zimmer even copied one of the songs. Buy it, its well  worth having in your collection; if your serious about films.",960854400,,552,4.591836734693878
118782,5,0790737868,"I became aware of Terrence Malick's work as a filmmaker after being stunned by his 1998 epic ""The Thin Red Line"".  In tracking down the rest of his work I was both dismayed and relieved (financially) to  learn he had directed just two other films. ""Badlands"", though  his debut, already is awash with his trademark style and may be his most  daring effort.
That being said I don't think ""Badlands"" is a  film for everyone. Though the story is captivating and enjoyable, the  narrative is de-emphasized for complex themes and gorgeous visuals.  Malick  makes his points with incredible subtlety, perhaps even to a fault.  However, this makes ""Badlands'"" mystique only grow with repeated  viewings. The robustness of detail is absolutely mind-blowing.  Most  impressive is how Malick creates a paradoxical environment between the  images, sounds, and narrative. Sissy Spacek's naive narration is in direct  contrast to a relatively uninspiring romance we see.  Perhaps most stunning  is overwhelming trapped feeling the film evokes while being set in the  spartan, vast, and barren landscapes of the Great Plains.  These are just a  few examples of a film that endlessly confounds and intrigues. I rank it  with Chinatown and Taxi Driver as the pinnacle of US produced film in the  70's. If you want to explore the possibilities of film I can't think of  anything to recommend more highly.",959299200,,1387,5.071111111111111
118783,4,0790737868,"The world of BADLANDS, Terrence Malick's first movie, is a world without God. Holly's father, Warren Oates, a painter, an artist, a creator has been shot to death by Kit. He has left a world unfinished, imperfect ; he didn't  have the time to give feelings to men.
So Kit and Holly, without a single  trace of guiltiness or moral sense, are going to be the Adam and Eva of  this nightmarish Eden. But they can't appreciate this Nature they have been  thrown into. Because the apple Sissy Spacek eats is rotten ; sex isn't a  taboo anymore. Furthermore, Martin Sheen is too busy to play his James Dean  character than to live an impassioned romance with Sissy.
One recognizes  in BADLANDS several themes that Terrence Malick will treat again 5 years  later in DAYS OF HEAVEN with Richard Gere and Sam Shepard. Sissy Spacek's  point of view, heartless and purely descriptive, is exactly the same point  of view that Linda Manz will adopt in DAYS OF HEAVEN.
BADLANDS is a  terribly pessimistic movie, it describes a world which is a sort of a mad  god's dream, a world that could be ours in a few years, a world that we  deserve, a world that we would have created. Alone.
Subtitles and scene  access as bonus features. Video and audio OK for me.

118784,5,0790737868,"""He was handsomer then anybody I've ever met, he looked just like James Dean"" narrates the naieve voice over of the gently nostalgic Holly (Sissy Spacek) towards the beginning of Badlands. A serliar killer  movie so spare and lacking in sensationalism that its bound to dissapoint  the less thoughtful among its viewers.
  Kit (Matin Sheen) is a real,  confident and familiar looking person. He is not a sociopathic religious  zealot or a man on a mission, his murders are mostly a matter of  convenience, murders that he wouldn't have commited had he not been  cornered. He doesn't like killing, but doesn't particualry seem regretful  of them either. In short, HE WASN'T EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.
  ""He  never met a 15 year old who behved like a grown up up and weren't  gigly"" narrates Holly. She too is a loner, living with a morose and  firm father. She is smitten by Kit straight away because he seems to be the  only one who would accept her. When Kit kills her father early on in the  film, there is no screaming, agitation or hysteria you would find in a  similar scene in other films. The most chilling thing about this film is  the matter of fact manner in which the murders take place. Malick then  contrasts this with the bare, spare and beautiful great out doors of South  Dakota and Montana. In his best film, the masterpiece The Thin Red Line he  suggested that the cruelty of man was natural, that it was only an  extention of what goes on in the animal world. Here the idealogy is even  more disturbing, which is cruelty and murder as a matter of convenience.  Therefore there are now flashy death scenes or stylistic violence, there  isn't even a love scene between Kit and Holly. We do not go along for the  ride like for example Bonnie and Clyde, instead we examine the events from  above. When Kit threatens a couple with a gun, Holly just strolls after  him, and tries to socialise with the girl, like Kit she isn't emotionally  connected with the murders, her narration suggests nostalgia, as if she was  watching these events in a film herself.
  The only time Kit loses his  temper is when Holly refuses to go with him on a car chase from the police,  ""He wanted a girl to cry over his dead body, he was wondering if he  could read about himself in the papers the day after his death."" The  only thing that would anger him is that he may ""GO DOWN IN THE SAME  PLAYED OUT SCENES"" like Bruce Springsteen says in his song  Badlands.
  Terrance Malick has made three film, all masterpieces. The  Thin Red Line remains his best (or anybody's best). Badlands however  remains a unique, thoughtful and beautiful film. And for that it should be  considered a classic.",956448000,5,2681,4.567510548523207
118785,5,0790737868,"The mysterious Terrence Malick couldn't of had a better directing debut. This film is starkly photographed and great attention to detail really show. But the characters, dialogue, pace and violence are so poetic it can  send chills up your spine. Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen are terrific as  the not-to-bright murderers who start a cross-country killing spree without  any real reason or cause, just to think that these characters actually  existed makes me wonder about America's youth. It is based on the actual  1958 murder spree of Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate. But the film is  fascinating and expertly crafted by a quiet genious; Terrance Malick, who  should keep on making films. Beautiful vast Western landscapes, great  cinematography and a disturbing score add to the tension. From a scale of  1-10 I give this film an 8!",954115200,,842,5.087591240875913
118786,5,0790737868,"Both Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek are absolutely terrific in this story which is loosely based on the notorious Starkweather murders in 1950's Nebraska. Amazingly realistic in its 1950's ambience, there is very careful detail via references to topical music, television, films and magazines of the period. As Kit, Sheen is astonishingly convincing and his resemblence to James Dean is striking; he gives a powerfully poignant performance. Spacek's Holly is his match and in her performance, she conveys an impressive acting ability as she is subtle and strangely moving. Really a cult-status film which deserves all the kudos given it, BADLANDS is a unique venture into the minds of two desperately lonely youths looking for sensationalism in all the wrong places.

118787,5,0790737868,"This is one of the best criminal/lovers on the run films to date.  As in all of director Malick's films, the music, acting, and photography are all first rate.  Malick does not stylize or glorify the violence like too many  other films of the same plotting.  The violence makes its impact on the  viewer without resorting to any exaggerations or excessiveness.  What is  most striking about the film are its many contrasts with the characters.  For example, the characters' alienation is depicted in the shots of lonely  desolate landscapes. Many of their spoken thoughts, points of view, and  statements are absolutely senseless....just like their killings.  Martin  Sheen is very chilling as the remorseless and trigger-happy Kit.  What also  makes Badlands different is that the film does not blame society for the  behavior of Kit and Holly (played wonderfully by Sissy Spacek). Powerful,  chilling, extremely well done and highly recommended.",942796800,18,947,5.25503355704698
