2165841,5,B00064AME4,"The fabulous cast, ambitious stories and dry humour all return in Series 2 of this hit UK show.

The arc of the quality here seems to be the complete reverse of Series 1. While I enjoyed both series, Series 1 had been marred by a pilot that made precious little sense and carried almost no sense of danger.  Series 2 starts off on a roll and retains its momentum all the way until the final episode, when a somewhat contrived plot, too much exposition and a forced ending (which the writer admits was necessitated by a question about whether a cast member would return for Series 3) mar the enjoyment.

But it remains a strong 10 episodes.  All the talent involved -- directors, writers, actors -- appear to be more comfortable since the template of the show was already so clear from the first series.  Matthew MacFadyen is given more of a chance to chomp scenery, and he excels at it -- his marvellous way with confrontational dialogue is made more enjoyable by the fact that he still has that boyish face which sometimes can sneak into '80s Tom Cruise territory, but when he turns on the heat, MacFadyen's intensity is electrifying.  Keeley Hawes still has the ability to light up the screen with her English-rose beauty, but she's also given a mix of a heartbreaking subplot as well as some deadpan jokes, both of which she delivers with aplomb.  Megan Dodds is superb as CIA agent Christine Dale, an oddball cross of mischievous schoolgirl and vicious ice goddess. The fact that she never completely slides into either role makes her endlessly interesting to watch, and Dodds makes for a much stronger romantic interest for MacFadyen than Series 1's Esther Hall (Ellie).

David Oyelowo is sadly given less emphasis in this series, but Peter Firth remains great as head spook Harry Pearce, and the loss of Jenny Agutter was really no big deal, the role of Tessa being too one-dimensional to be interesting anyway.  The ""older woman"" role is filled by new addition Nicola Walker, whose energy fits the cast much better.  Also new to the cast is Shauna Macdonald, a vibrant young Scottish actress who walks off with some of the funniest moments in the show.  This sense of humour continues to carve MI-5 an identity distinct from that of the American spy show, 24, despite the similarities.  In Series 2, MI-5 further indulges in its unique strengths:  Since this show doesn't shy away from using real names, real countries and real causes (nothing like 24 Season 2's ""these three Arab countries"" device here), this lends MI-5 a huge degree of verisimilitude which serves to make us even more on edge.  Let's face it, it's much more engaging, and liberating, to be able to hear ""Libya"" or ""President Bush and Tony Blair"" on the show than vague references to ""Arab countries"" and ""the Prime Minister and the Ambassador"".  I suppose American TV doesn't trust the audience to be willing to accept the idea of using real names in fiction, so when MI-5 throws you an episode where the Prime Minister and the royal family of Britain are all presumed dead, it's exhilarating to watch.

My only grudge is with the final episode.  Again, it's the classic TV dilemma -- how do you deal with the potential departure of a central actor?  The episode is bogged down by the need to have an open-ended ending which allows them the freedom to bring the actor back (or otherwise).  But it's still moving in many places, especially the Romeo and Juliet trials and tribulations between Tom Quinn and Christine Dale, compounded by the fracture of the Harry-Tom-Zoe-Danny axis.

A great show, and I can't wait for Series 3 to arrive.",1124496000,34,3614,4.724522292993631
2165842,5,B00064AME4,This series (both 1 and 2) has been stunning since I popped in the very first episode. The writing is exceptional - it deals with people and culture and the world political situation without sacrificing the story. The characters are very believable - we see their strengths and their weaknesses. The cinematography is wonderful. All in all - a real treat,1123286400,3,354,4.819672131147541
2165843,3,B00064AME4,"I've not actually seen Volume 2.  I bought and have watched the first DVD set (for a much more reasonable price), and enjoyed it.  This is a good series, and I'm sure the next 10 episodes are well done (typical anti-Bush BBC bias aside), but c'mon, 60 dollars or more?

Consequently, I'm reviewing the *cost*.  When I can get a 22 episode season of, say, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (or any number of great TV shows) for maybe $40, I'd say that getting about 1/2 the episodes (allowing for them being a *full* hour) for 50% higher cost is not a good bang for the buck.",1119398400,12,565,4.30188679245283
2165844,5,B00064AME4,"If a show were to capture the actual nature of being a (security service) spy, this is probably it.

Take advantage of bad situations, be morally dispassionate, infiltrate any activist organization, avert or CREATE disaster to suit your political needs, and kill anyone who gets in your way (court proceedings are so messy). There were numerous times I found myself clapping out loud, yelling: ""That's EXACTLY what they do!!""

Of course, the best way to kill a Politician is to simply steer their airplane into a mountain (Oh yeah, THAT hasn't happened about a dozen times). And the best place to kill a VIP (or royal) is in a road-tunnel where you control the variables and no one can see what happens (then claim the video is too ""Graphic"" and would disrespect the family of the victim). And, you'll never see a spy in a courtroom giving testimony (at least not under their real name), it's much easier, and common to simply kill those that cross the service.

This show is way too BLOODY BRILLIANT!!

There's even an episode where a personal friend of the British PM is importing huge amounts of drugs into the U.K. and they don't touch him (of course not, just BUST anybody that uses it, LIKE AMERICA!).

You will bite your nails, sweat your palms, and gain an insight into the trade that the English have mastered for over 500 years. They taught us, even though our Company is far more ruthless. And if you think I'm kidding, go learn how to to read.

Thankyou BBC!!",1106870400,14,1471,4.616858237547893
2165845,5,B00064AME4,"This second season of MI-5 covers quite a range of activities which may or may not constitute a threat to the state. Unlike some of the more glitzy glamorous shows about the secret services this is a little more gritty and a little more true to like effecting to shine a light into the dark to show some of the creepy crawlies running hither and thither. This is part of the attraction of the show which demonstrates the depths to which public servants will stoop to allow us to continue our daily lies.

The only drawback to this drama is that it is a BBC production which, by it's very nature, exhibits a little schizophrenia - a highly polished production with a gloss and an angle to push.

Having said that, there is more than a little truth which permeates the plotlines such as the constant competition between the different branches of the services and law enforcement within Britain itself as well as a constant competitive process with other foreign agencies throughout the world most notable from the American Security Services. What results is a love-hate relationship on both sides and where trust is a dirty word.

It seems more than a little odd that more is not made of the exploration of the tendencies of the elected political establishment to be recorded and noted and exposed when it suits the services to do so. Given the range of activities included in this season, the exclusion seems stranger still. Similarly the depths to which elected government officials will stoop in following their own agendas is not a central focus her where it really ought to be.

US viwers, seeing the complete episodes for the first time in this collection, will note the relatively open jibes against the Bush administration and it's foreign policy approach which permeate the entire season and are continued on the third, currently showing in truncated form on A&E. Since the show first aired this has been a constant theme and demonstrates a political aspect of the BBC which really has no place given the exclusions mentioned above.

Typically too for a show which sells across the world the season acts as a little tourist guide particularly to London with some exquisite shots of some of the panorama which makes up Britain's capital city.

This series of fictional tales explores the  difficult personal lives of the major players involved which typically involves some difficult sacrifices and the consequent tendency to inbreeding with similar types of individuals. Who do you trust and who can you trust?

It seems to me that the notion of the national interest is extremely subjective and much depends on the political outlook in vogue at the time. Many people are often left wondering whether or not these tales reflect actual events but are thinly disguised while others believe they are merely fiction.

It is hard to tell but to any observer of events over the last forty years or so there is more than a grain of truth in each of them.

I highly recommend this season notwithstanding any earlier remarks made about BBC bias. It is certainly a litttle more cerebral than your average spy show but I would like to think that the show's producers intend to make us think about what is done on our behalf in the name of democracy or whatever we prefer to call our system of government. Interestingly enough the whole notion of this show being produced in this form by the BBC in a time where a Labour Government has the watch is enough to set off conspiracy theorists across the world.

A high quality drama, which makes us think, but by the BBC is a good result for the viewing public.

2165846,5,B00064AME4,"I continue to be riveted by this show.  There is no show on television in America that presents a truer picture of what it means to serve your country in the War on Terror.  This season ratchets up the suspense and personal angst of the main characters.  There were times as I watched this show that I was literally floored by the actions of these men and women, the lengths they were willing to go in order to do their job as they saw it should be done.  Matthew MacFadyen once again turns in a bravura performance and by the end of the season you are actually on the edge of your seat to know what happens.  This series continues to be one of the most well-acted and well-written spy shows I have ever seen.  Should not be missed by anyone who loves great drama and the spy thriller genre.",1105920000,56,791,4.24
2165847,5,B00064AME4,"I have both Volume 1 and Volume 2 of this outstanding series and can't say enough about it.  The stories are dramatic and compelling and the DVD's contain both the uncut versions of the episodes as well as an impressive number of quality extras including interviews, stills and documentaries.

2165848,5,B00064AME4,"The BBC nails another one.  This is the best show on television.  If you like 24, this is better.  The writing is more crisp, the plots believable and exciting, and the acting is far better than anything on American tv.  You don't get scenery chewing 101, you get real characters with wit and intelligence who occasionally screw up.

This show makes Alias look like Romper Room.  These 1-hour versions give you the WHOLE show, not the 44-minute A&E butcher jobs.  It's like watching a densely plotted mini movie with continuing characters.  Macfadyen, Hawes, and Firth are terrific, etching flawed but believable characters.

2165885,4,B00064AME4,"This is my favourite episode of Spooks. I wanted a digital copy, but this version has been edited.

Subtle yet important lines of dialogue have been cut, primarily involving personal interplay. For example, this exchange between Ruth and Tom was cut. It's very telling about her character and how she responds to pressure:

R: This is pointless. Im an analyst with nothing to analyse. Just  scissors to stab in the wall.
T: When the power comes back on, youll be the most important person in this room.
R: You know, I never realised, Im just my job. Nothing else. Without it, I go completely to pieces.
T: No, Ruth, you're much more important than that.
R: No, no, Im happy with that.

I don't understand why Amazon would sell what appears to be BBC America's version, edited for American television run-times, without notification that the episode for sale is not the one originally aired.

The episode itself, however, is astonishing. I only wish there were a way to see all of it.",1445385600,,983,4.691860465116279

2165902,5,B00064AME4,"Like many shows, a series grows on you as you feel more acquainted with the characters. Such familiarity fleshes out the story lines that are also necessary for a successful show. MI-5 is a well developed series that deals with exciting issues that are relevant to our current world. The writing is generally first rate and the stories are well put together. Season 2 was excellent for its introspective look at the characters as the stresses of the ""spy business"" took its toll. Amidst this personal look at the individuals involved, there were exciting and often tragic stories told about today's ongoing war with terrorist elements. I have really been ""hooked"" by the series, am into Season 3, and look forward to the fact that I think there are still 5 more seasons to view.

As an aside, I have found that watching shows without commercial interruption is addictively enjoyable. Even though I tape a number of network series, having to constantly fast forward through the ads is distracting. We recently watched live a series that we had been introduced to by viewing past seasons on Amazon. We really enjoyed the past seasons, but felt the current one lacking.

Their explanation was that the rights for free distribution had expired.  I can certainly understand that but then I ask why would anyone start watching a series on Prime not knowing when the rug would be pulled out?

2165923,5,B00064AME4,"We have enjoyed MI-5 both on TV and on DVD, and have now watched the entire series and loved every minute of them.  Great acting, true-to-life situations, I suspect.  We were heartbroken when some of the main characters were killed off, and then there were so many twists and turns in the plot.  One never knew who was a good guy, or who was the bad guy.  Superb",1361059200,,362,4.279411764705882

2165934,5,B00064AME4,"I just finished watching the second episode of season 2 (I did watch all of the first season) and I am still emotionally drained. This show is NOT for the feint of heart. The realism is in your face and there are moments when I am literally pleading for a different outcome. MI-5 goes to the extreme. The plots are relevant and brilliantly written. This series truly blows most American television out of the water. I would advise parental guidance however as the subject matters covered are violent, controversial and very intense. For the mature viewer, this is top-notch television. I am looking forward to the rest of this season and seasons 3-10.",1334620800,,651,4.769911504424779
2165935,5,B00064AME4,"MI-5 is simply one of the most amazing TV drama shows to have been made. Focusing on that part of the British security services that focus on domestic threats (MI-6, in contrast, focuses primarily on international threats), MI-5 shows how the ""Defense of the Realm"" is carried out by normal individuals who join 5 to help it with its mission. The show is intensely exciting, intelligently written and superbly acted, and is so well produced that episodes seem more like one-hour movies than a television show. Episodes are focused on how MI-5 responds to a seemingly never ending series of domestic threats of all types, economic, political, terror, and public, and often highlights the toll these duties take on its members. The political backdrop under which 5 executes its duties is also often explored.

In Season Two, the show really comes into its own. As we move past the Season One cliffhanger, the series starts kicking even further into high gear, and it is at this point that we can clearly see that everyone involved in the show--the writers, the directors, the actors, and the cast--have now precisely figured out how all the pieces of the show best fit together, and what can only be described as an immense amount of talent is focused solely on the development of the stories and plot lines. (MI-5 is really designed to be watched in order of episodes, without skipping, as the series is supremely good at weaving multiple, concurrent and intersecting plot lines that work across an entire season.) The emotional and dramatic levels reached in Season Two are high, and each episode ends with the viewer anxious to see the next installment, a characteristic of MI-5 that will now not stop all the way to end of its entire series run. We see all types of threats emerge in this Season, and the manner in which 5 is required to deal with each requires ingenuity, diligence, skill, and some amount of risk taking.

There are few shows that I have seen that could compare to MI-5. It is a superb show. It's complex and intelligent enough to force you to stay on your toes to understand it all. It's dramatic and powerful. It makes you think about and question the proper role of the security services in any country, and the best manner in which to respond to the type of threats highlighted in the show. It doesn't shy away from awkward contradictions in political and security apparatuses, neither does it shy away from taking direct shots at a whole variety of national policies in both the UK and other countries. You will certainly be entertained, but you'll be educated at the same time, and you'll be made to think.

On format ...
There are as of late 2011 no Blu-Ray discs for any of the MI-5 Seasons. We can only hope these will be released in the near future, but for now, it will be on DVD that you watch. But that's not entirely a bad thing. The production and post-production values are so high that the DVD's really shine. MI-5 presently a glossy, artsy, and high-resolution world, even on DVD. (Consider coupling it with an upsampling DVD player, and you'll be getting a bit closer to Blu-Ray.) Some of the Seasons have been expensive to purchase, but prices seem to be coming down. There are typically between eight and ten 60-minute episodes per season.",1325548800,,3280,4.700869565217391

2165937,5,B00064AME4,"As I have previously stated on this board, I started watching this wonderful British spy thriller by starting with its Season Seven (7) becoming so enthralled with this series that I decided to watch MI-5 from its beginning.  Here I am at Season two (2) and it is so very great.  Season two (2) on five (5) discs featuring ten (10) episodes  is so highly intense and is so well written, directed and acted.

 I was completely besotted by each of the episodes in Season two (2).  The excellent British intelligence team of MI-5 has settled into a very cohesive unit solving horrible threats to the security of Great Britain and sometimes awful threats to the world by some very nasty people such as terrorists.  Using ingenious methods and very ""high tech"" methods, the MI-5 team aborts these threats splendidly in Season two (2).  My god, this season is so very good; I remained ""glued ""  at all times to the TV screen in ""fear"" that I'd miss something--this Season two  2) is so very good.  I do love this series.",1319846400,,1014,4.54696132596685
2165938,5,B00064AME4,"It is the quintessential suspense feature that the Brit's just know how to produce.
I can see why Americans want to imitate them....but this is as good a series as they get.",1317859200,,173,4.4375
2165939,4,B00064AME4,"Threats constantly bombard the UK and only the gang at the MI-5 can save their country from destruction. The cliffhanger from Series 1 is quickly resolved in the first episode. Master Spy Tom Quinn begin a freefall as he tries to find love and a personal life despite his secret life as a spy.

Zoe and Danny are back as part of Quinn's team. Little mistakes can be costly and their jobs are constantly on the line. The mysterious Tessa pops up again and again and her power struggle with Harry becomes stronger and becomes deadly.

Series 2 has one of the most gripping episodes of TV that I have ever seen. A deadly biological attack has hit London and several other cities. The team is trapped in their offices unable to leave and contact with the outside world is cut off. It's a truly fascinating episode. They MI-5 staff can't stay yet they can't leave. Don't miss this episode.

Series 2 ends with a more intense cliffhanger than Series 1. Has Tom Quinn finally gone off the deep end and changed sides? MI-5 is a fascinating look into the lives of people whose jobs are secret and whose lives and their lives of their friends are constantly at risk. How do they keep doing their jobs?

I enjoy the modern, high-tech look of the series. It is funny to see the old Mac computers that looked like table lamps with the swivel arm. Top of the line for 2003 but now looking so sorely outdated. Of course, MI-5 keeps turning up Bond-esque gadgets. Always fun times at the MI-5...well, maybe not.",1315267200,,1495,4.485294117647059
2165940,5,B00064AME4,"MI-5 is such a wonderful series.  It's pacing, direction, acting is all superb.

2165941,5,B00064AME4,"Well I managed to get past the first few minutes. More precisely, I've seen the first eight seasons thus far. The agenda that really seems to drive this show is highly intelligent writing, stellar acting and  first rate direction. Not for everyone though. Fans of American reality shows will probably have a hard time keeping up with this one.",1307836800,3,343,4.813559322033898

2165944,5,B00064AME4,"This review pertains to the entire MI-5 series.  Why can't American TV produce quality productions like the BBC?  Years ago we had Mission Impossible, but that was in a different lifetime.  MI-5 is like Mission Impossible on steroids.  Every episode is a fast-paced, complete in itself rush of coherent adrenaline. Furthermore, the characters are multi-dimensional, and we begin to care about them.  That they may be flawed makes them all the more believable.  I can't get enough of British TV, and MI-5 tops the list.",1299369600,2,518,5.035294117647059
2165945,5,B00064AME4,"The BBC, as usual, does things right. Real drama, real spies, real action. American TV cop shows are all T&A and personal problem trash - and don't forget all the sex BS that is sponsor driven. Give me subtitles ANYTIME!!!",1294963200,,222,4.575

It's WAY better than pretty much anything else on today.  This show makes its ""spooks"" (spies) incredibly smart but also realistically flawed...they ARE human, after all.  Gripping show; each episode draws you in.",1271808000,,370,4.935483870967742

I love the story lines and the acting. It's just a wonderful and different style of TV programming. I can't wait to see the next season.",1255392000,,298,4.339285714285714
2165950,5,B00064AME4,I love this television show from BBC. I started watching because I love Matthew MacFadyen and got hooked.  Very interesting to watch a show made in England as opposed to those we see made here. A warning...more violence shown.,1236470400,,226,4.794871794871795
2165951,3,B00064AME4,"The first season was smashing, and it looked as though the second season was going to be just as strong. But somewhere along the way the tone of the show changed, becoming more politically opinionated on the issues they are dealing with, and the characters becoming increasingly introspective.

This could have been a solid development, if well handled. Instead, we're treated to trite political comments with all the insight of a 60 Minutes expose, and an ever-changing group of characters who one by one lose sight of their purpose and devolve into annoyingly self-centered twits.

By the end of the season the only fun left is guessing which character is going to become the next who will ignore their job and potentially allow millions to die because they have fallen in love with someone they met hours earlier or because they (finally) got caught committing some crime.

Things don't improve in Season 3, which swaps the original cast out, and the revolving door continues in the later seasons. McDonald's has better retention. Makes you wonder what the hiring process is like. Again, this could be interesting if well handled, but the producers took the easy way out, and instead recycle the ""I don't agree with X, so I'm going to whine about it for a while, no one listens so I'll get maudlin, and finally leave"" character arc.

Buy the first season. If you loved it, rather than buying the later seasons, watch season one again.",1219363200,13,1437,4.829268292682927

It stars Matthew MacFadyen (Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice), and he is gorgeous!  His real-life wife is also a star on the show.  There are lots of disk extras - deleted scenes, gallery, trailers for other BBC shows, etc.  I LOVED THE LAST EPISODE OF MI-5 (SEASON 1)!!!  The first episode of Season 2 continues this story.  Some story lines reappear in several of the plots.  One will find contemporary issues of Muslim attacks, abortion bombings, the IRA's influence, etc.  You will be hooked in no time!!!!",1176076800,2,672,4.782608695652174

When my husband & I find ourselves bored to tears with sitcoms and other broadcast offerings, we substitute MI-5 viewing marathons. Season 2 continues with thoughtful plot lines and relevant character development. As for the DVD itself, the behind the scenes offerings are worthwhile & informative. I admire the clever DVD menus, but the navigation can become a little annoying after several discs...it's a small price to pay for such an rare, intelligent television viewing experience.",1168300800,2,551,5.202247191011236

The plots are not nearly as over the top as '24' and the realism is much much higher than in Alias. The characters are well portrayed as everyday people which makes it easy to connect with them. Again, I like the fact that the show has a British view on world politics and seeing the landscape through their eyes is very interesting compared to how American TV portrays the world.

However, I was not disappointed! Although the personal experiences and job frustrations of the characters bring lots of tension into the series, they do not dominate and each episode has a worthy  plot in itself. In other words, if there's a standard formula for episodes, I haven't discovered it yet and each new plot has kept me sitting on the edge of my chair. On to the third series!",1154131200,12,580,4.8

The sophistication of the plots, dialog and characters is several cuts above the typical U.S. spy thrillers, including ""24"".  In fact, after watching the first season of MI-5, I could not get back to ""24"" which seemed sophmoric by comparison.  If you enjoy ""24"", wait for the series to end before starting MI-5.

2165965,5,B00064AME4,"Season two amps up the adrenaline another notch on this gritty spy thriller series.  The suspense builds both within each episode and throughout the series.  Personal as well as political stakes are high for our heroes.

The acting and writing are superb in this series with a subtlety rarely found in spy dramas.  The intensely close relationships formed under combat situations are touchingly portrayed.  These are passionate people who must put their feelings aside for a cause they believe in.

Another bonus is that while violence is present it is not gratuitous.

2165966,5,B00064AME4,"I loved the first season of this show when it found its way to American shores, and I was soon blown away by the second season as well.  This is a show about agents involved in espionage for the British government to protect England...but it goes far deeper than that.  You actually CARE about these people, who they love, who they break up with, and who dies.  Yes, people die, people betray each other, and people get framed (if you haven't seen it, I won't give that one away).  I love this show more than I love anything else on TV, and I am hopelessly addicted.  No sophmore slump for this series at all.",1135641600,4,609,4.307017543859649
2165967,5,B00064AME4,"This series is remarkably good. In its genre I don't believe I've seen anything else on TV that comes close. But $60 for ten episodes does seem like a high price. That is why I went to Amazon.uk, found the same second season for a total price of 12.42 including shipping to my US address. That converts to a little over $20. This solution may not be for the faint of heart since there can be issues of country code and so on. But I already have the first season also purchased from Amazon.uk and have had no problems with it. Globalism doesn't always have to favor just the rich and powerful.",1132963200,6,592,4.294642857142857
2165968,5,B00064AME4,"I had only marginally good things to say about MI-5, Series/Season 1.  Willing to give the series a fair shot, I watched Series/Season 2.  And I'm glad I did.  Much better than the first go-around, Series/Season 2 ends with a bang with quite a bit of meat enroute to the series conclusion.  Two episodes - the Emergency Reaction Exercise and President's Visit episodes - were outstanding.  There are two new series - I can't wait until we get them on DVD.",1127779200,5,455,4.567901234567901
