8336818,5,B001QXDW82,Charlie Rose doesn't mess around...his interviews are usually as good as any you will find and the more difficult the subject or interviewee the better and he knocked it out of the park with Rourke....truly worth the large price tag.,1241568000,2,233,4.85
8336819,5,B001QXDW82,"I really enjoyed this interview.  Charlie clearly made Mickey feel at ease so he could really open up about some touchy and very personal subjects.  Not only was Mickey great, but Charlie Rose seems like a wonderful person and I really like any interview he conducts.  We learn some great tidbits about ""The Wrestler"", Darren Aronofsky, Bruce Springsteen, Sean Penn, and Mickey also explains his reasons for falling from grace.  Definitely recommend this if you are a Mickey Rourke fan, or if you are eager to learn more about him.",1238889600,2,531,4.866666666666666
8336820,4,B001QXDW82,"I loved the interview, but I thought it would have been better if it were longer.  It seems that Mickey Rourke was cut off a lot.  Examples:when he was talking about things he would not change even though he has changed, talking about his dog Loki who had taken a stroke but was on the rebound.  Of course this was before Loki passed away. I also would have liked to hear Mickey Rourke comment on his co-star Marissa Tomei and what it was like working with her.  She is a favorit actress of mine and I think she did a fabulous job.

All in all I loved the interview and would recommend it.",1238630400,,589,4.176991150442478
