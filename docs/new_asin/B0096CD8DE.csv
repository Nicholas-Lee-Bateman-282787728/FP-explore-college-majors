8536588,5,B0096CD8DE,I love a good dance-based workout and this one is a ton of fun. It also feels like a workout - I am definitely sweaty at the end of the cardio section - but it doesn't feel too long and it's never so intense that I stop enjoying myself.,1503532800,,236,3.836734693877551

8536590,5,B0096CD8DE,"I loved this workout video. It is about 45 min. long with a couple of different Go, Go routines. You really felt like Annette Funicello. It is totally fun, and you really look hot! ha. I tried Hip Hop videos and I am not in shape enough - nor have the coordination to do them. I didn't want to do Bellydancing or Salsa, and dancing to the Oldies with Richard Simmons seemed like the last resort. Thank goodness for this Go Go workout video. She also takes time to teach the steps - which are easy and cool to do. And yes you do work up a sweat! Thank you Angie!",1436400000,,561,4.063063063063063

8536592,4,B0096CD8DE,"This is the first DVD workout that I actually enjoy! Angie's positive attitude is infectious, the moves are fun and the music is fantastic! So much better than the usual elevator techno of other workout DVDs.
My only complaint is a minor one. She does have a how-to section for each move, but they're run through rather quickly. It feels more like an intermediate instruction than beginner. I have a hard time keeping up! That said, as long as I keep moving, it's a great workout!",1374105600,2,480,4.593023255813954
8536593,4,B0096CD8DE,"This has been a great addition to my dance aerobic dvd rotation. It's a quick workout and a fun way to get your heart rate up. Angie is adorable.  She is great at teaching the individual steps in the tutorial section and it feels like your working out with a friend.  I hope there will be more workouts in the future. I love the music and the style!

My only wish is that there was more additional steps in the cardio go go section.  Angie keeps building on the first steps and when you learn a new step, you start from the beginning again.  I like the layout in Shaun T's Rockin' Body, he builds a combination of steps over the course of several minutes, moves to new combination then combines them all for a complete routine at the end. Just a personal preference.

The Go Go Box section incorporates more dance styles.  Now I just have to get a pair of my own go go boots. Thanks Angie, I look forward to more workout dvds from you.",1367280000,3,935,4.219101123595506
8536594,5,B0096CD8DE,"This delightful fitness program is based on go-go dance which originated in the 1960's popular in nightclubs. Go go dance is typically danced in high boots.

  If you have never danced ""GO-GO"" before, Angie makes it easy by including a GO-GO Dance Encyclopedia in which the movement vocabulary used in the entire workout program is demonstrated. This can be done by anyone in or out of boots because the movement is simple-like the twist or grapevines done at a fast pace and then layered with arm movement. Following the introduction of go go dance and its elements such as posture, proper warm up, I followed along taken in by Angie's cute costumes and boots only to soon feel the high impact, pumping up the heart rate and breaking a sweat!

The two workout sections are nonstop and definitely work out the entire body.
 Section one: Cardio-Go Go: Full body workout that evolves into a full dance routine to the music of Los Straitjackets with rapid movement switches. Some of the movement here are hop and touch, (Pony), the twist, and squats and shimmies.  Knee raises can be high or low to vary the impact of the workout.
 Section two: Involves more classic movement, such as the Freddie, grapevine, Watusi, mashed potato typical of this dance genre. Section one felt more of a cardio workout than this section.
This program is fun and alluring, and only about 40 minutes long. The cool-down includes a short section of stretches.",1354924800,8,1436,4.7894736842105265
