7984642,4,B00008IZAU,"Based on a true story from the 1930s, Gladys Aylward is a poor English woman who is determined to be a missionary in China despite the impossible conditions and the threat of war. Although this film may be too long and drawn out for contemporary tastes, it is well done and spectacular  in its scope. The movie is a truly inspiring story of a woman of substance who perseveres, changes lives, and saves lives through courage and grit. Well worth watching.",1499558400,,455,4.617283950617284
