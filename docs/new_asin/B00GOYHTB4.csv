6097668,5,B00GOYHTB4,"I love this show - I finally was able to get my sister to watch it only after she and her ""uppity"" boyfriend thought it disgusting (having never watched it I don't know how they could judge so easily).  Now my sister loves it - says that it reminds her of her youth.  I have watched season 1 on DVD probably 100 times by now.  I would like a version without captions though as I find myself reading instead of watching their hilarious facial expressions!  Any true Southerner who grew up poor or has empathy for those who struggle in life living in a single parent home can totally relate.  I love watching their creative minds at work and recalling my past and how much fun can be had with so little...",1398211200,,703,4.295454545454546

6097672,4,B00GOYHTB4,"Before ordering this set, I had never actually seen an episode of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo on television. But I had heard so much about it and how crazy it was that my curiosity got the better of me and I bought the DVD blindly. I admit I take guilty pleasure in my share of entertainment that others might consider to be of the more, er, ""lowbrow"" variety, lol, but I actually really did enjoy this show and thought that underneath all the white trash jargon and nave backwoods sensibilities there was a real sense of heart about it.

In a nutshell, season 1 follows the exploits of 6-year-old Alana ""Honey Boo Boo"" Thompson and her family around their hometown of McIntyre, Georgia over the course of one summer. Whether entering beauty pageants, trying to raise a squealing piglet, celebrating Christmas in July, battling the bugs and heat, entering the Redneck Games, extreme couponing, or anticipating the birth of a baby with a surplus of thumbs, there is very rarely a dull moment. Yes, it's easy to laugh and make fun - and frankly, to put it kindly, it IS rather astounding how unrefined and thoughtless some of these people can be at times, so definitely do not take this as a cross section of your average American household - but like I said above, they also strike me as basically genuine people, struggling to make the best of their circumstances. How much of it is played up for the sake of TV, I can't say, but either way it's quite amusing to say the least!

DVD-wise this set is pretty bare bones. There are nine 21-minute episodes and a tenth 43-minute episode all on one disc, and there are no special features. (I would have loved a look behind the scenes or some unaired bloopers from Mama June.) But, the asking retail price is reasonable for what you get and the entertainment value is high, so I'd say it's worth a look if you get the chance.",1394409600,10,1867,4.504424778761062
6097673,1,B00GOYHTB4,"This show makes me sick to my core! Honey Boo Hoo Hoo, is just a spoiled little monster. They family is made up of one entire set of GOOFBALL's. This family show's American's at it's worst. Then you have Mama June who appears to have the IQ of a tic, you know, the kind found on Dog's.
They are a disgrace to the Human race!!",1394323200,4,325,4.015384615384615
6097674,5,B00GOYHTB4,We are so pleased with our copy of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo Season one. Haven't seen Season 1 so we decided to buy it.  Want to purchase Season 2 also but can't find it anywhere. Will buy from this Seller if they have it. Thank you soooo much. Avery happy customer!,1394236800,5,265,4.096153846153846

8625890,4,B00GOYHTB4,"Docking a star only because there's only 10 episodes for 20 dollars. I love the show and want season 2 on DVD also but can't find it anywhere. My DVD came brand new, all packaged up professionally and the disc was in perfect condition. If this seller offers the second season I'll definitely be purchasing it. I only wish it was a little more reasonable in price for the amount of content you get. A $15 dollar pricetag would be more pleasant. You can watch the same episodes for 1.99 through Amazon video instantly, so you'd think you might get a good deal or even small discount by purchasing the disc but that's not the case.",1469491200,,628,4.422413793103448
