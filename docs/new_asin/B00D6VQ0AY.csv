8590113,3,B00D6VQ0AY,"I just want to confirm that I purchased this DVD-R in September 2015 and Marilyn Monroe's part is in the movie, it begins at around 27 minutes when she is seen from a far in the restaurant and her actual scene begins a few minutes later. A user complained that her part was cut in the dvd.",1442620800,3,289,4.087719298245614
8590114,2,B00D6VQ0AY,"I purchased this movie because I knew that it was one of Marilyn Monroe's earlier movies. The dvd synopsis even mentioned she was in ithe but uncredited. For all Marilyn fans, don't be duped. She IS NOT in this dvd. They deleted her scene on the DVD. the movie itself wasn't bad but I rated it based on the false hood and using Marilyn's name to sell the product.",1438387200,,363,4.27536231884058

8590116,3,B00D6VQ0AY,"Just a vehicle for the couple to work together, but since I like both of them it was fine.  June Allyson brings something
to each of her films that makes them special.  I enjoyed Dick Powell's early films and how he was able to segue from the
musicals into the straight roles.",1407456000,,276,4.288461538461538

8590119,5,B00D6VQ0AY,I was very pleased to see a movie 62 years old finally released commercially and of such high quality production. The bonus was it featured a very young Marilyn Monroe in a small role. Well Done !!!!! I note with disappointment that Leonard Malton has deleted it from his movie book just before it was released on DVD. The same thing applied to the 1947 movie Dangerous Years (with a very young Marilyn Monroe) - finally released in 2012 on DVD but it won't be shown in Leonard Malton's movie book. Congratulations to Amazon for making it available. Thanks!!,1378944000,4,558,4.646464646464646
8590120,4,B00D6VQ0AY,"The ""Right Cross"" (1950) is a quite interesting drama and incredible cast : Ricardo Montalban, June Allyson and Dick Powell. I like a story of this movie and all of actors play. Most impressive part of ""Right Cross"" (on my mind) is appearance of young Marilyn Monroe in a restaurant scene.",1373068800,,289,4.686274509803922
