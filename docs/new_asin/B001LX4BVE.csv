8320016,5,B001LX4BVE,This was a well done film about a terrible time in History.  These people were heroic on both sides.  Certainly glad I wasn't there.,1398729600,,132,4.458333333333333
8320017,3,B001LX4BVE,This was informative but needed more information. It lacked the background of the individual soldiers. This was one of the british armies finest hours.,1376524800,,151,5.333333333333333
8320018,5,B001LX4BVE,"This DVD provided a historically accurate counter balance to the movie ""Zulu,"" and it demonstrated how a small force of well trained and disciplined men can take on seemingly overwhelming odds. At the same time, Zulu warriors were well trained and disciplined, but they were poorly armed with battle tactics unsuited for meeting a modern military machine. This latter point has cogency not just for the Zulus, but it applies to almost every military organization in the history of mankind. This failure by the Zulus not only cost them their kingdom, but they ended relegated to being just a minor footnote to Africa's history.

8320019,4,B001LX4BVE,"Short documentary film of the battle of Roarke's Drift in Natal, South Africa where a small force (less than 150 men) defended a mission station against an estimated 4000 Zulu's. 11 Victoria Cross Medals were awarded for heroism (the British equivalent of the USA Medal of Honor). The film is factual and good quality. What I found annoying was the way several of the participants (played by actors) in the battle were ""interviewed"". I much prefer the documentaries produced by ""The History Channel"". Overall an OK film and worth watching but in my opinion there are much better films on the market....FYI..if you want to read a really good book on the battle, read ""LIKE WOLVES ON THE FOLD, THE DEFENSE OF ROARKE'S DRIFT"" BY Col. Mike Snook. (also read ""HOW CAN A MAN DIE BETTER"" about the previous day's battle at Isandlwana, also by Col. Snook.",1259971200,21,847,4.7687074829931975
