3961683,5,B002OKK2AW,"An extremely clever send up of the STAR TREK franchise with an Eastern European bent made in Finland.  One just knows that this movie is going to be irreverent when in the opening scene the Captain comes out from the head (conveniently located adjacent the bridge) dragging toilet paper stuck to the bottom of his shoe!!!

Enough said.  You have to see the rest for yourself.  Set a course for warp(ed) hilarity and out of this world laughter. A must for TREK fans or anyone who just likes to poke fun at Science Fiction.",1267315200,,521,4.51063829787234
3961684,1,B002OKK2AW,"This fanmade offering, more than seven years in the making, gets the look and the effects right, but very little else. The script relies too much on knowledge of the past ""Star Wreck"" webisodes, and the humor mostly falls flat. The acting ranges from passable to amateurish. While the Finnish with English subtitles was only nominally distracting, for a comedy it might've worked best if they'd dubbed an English version. Considering Revolver is marketing this as a parody of the J.J. Abrams' ""Star Trek"" reboot, there are going to be a lot of disappointed fans out there.",1256342400,3,572,4.907216494845361
3961685,5,B002OKK2AW,i absolutely loved this film...thought it was hilarious....one of the best star trek spoof ever done! the special effects are just incredible.,1255132800,3,142,5.5
3961686,5,B002OKK2AW,"There have been a LOT of Star Trek films produced by fans over the years.  Some have been amazing, some have been platforms for self-insertion fan fiction, and some have just been embarrasingly derivative.  A few of them have even been parodies, though sadly the production quality has rarely been worth commenting about.  What makes this film stand out is the fact that it does something very different than all the others: it doesn't try to be Star Trek, and is brilliant because of it.
Someone who has never seen Star Trek could sit down, watch this movie, and still come away laughing.  One of the reasons for this is that, at its core, it's really not making fun of Star Trek at all.  Most of the jokes that are directly connected to the series actually stem from the various questionable translation choices that were made in adapting the shows and movies to the Finnish language.  The main character, James B. Pirk, isn't so much a parody of Captain Kirk as he is a thoroughly flawed character who one could imagine would look up to someone like Kirk as a role model and end up learning all the wrong lessons from him.  I think it helps that most of these characters were created years ago, and given enough time to develop their own individual personalities and identities which remain separate from what we see on the show.  As such their behavior and actions stand out as being genuinely funny on their own instead of relying on a previous knowledge of the source material being parodied to get the joke.  It also doesn't hurt that the filmmakers held every step of the production to an exceedingly high standard.  This film is filled with excellent performances and some of the best effects and production values you're likely to find in any fan film, let alone a parody (most of which don't even bother trying to look good on the assumption that this somehow adds to the ""charm."")  While there are times when its clear that the film is the work of a bunch of friends setting out to have some fun making a movie, the end results are nothing if not professional.  In fact I would say that many of the battle sequences are in fact better than some of the ones we've seen in the official movies.

That said, there are a few things that a potential customer needs to keep in mind when purchasing this film.  For a start: it is a Finnish film, made for a Finnish audience, most of whom it can be assumed are fluent Finnish speakers.  Finnish isn't always a very pretty language (though I'll admit that as time went on it started to take on a near hypnotic quality.)  There is no English dubbing, though there are excellent subtitles.  The translation was done by one of the people who worked on the film, so the film avoids many of the usual translation errors.  All the jokes relying on a play on words and other forms of linguistic humor (such as Pirk's obvious difficulty pronouncing and/or understanding the definitions of some of the words he uses) are faithfully translated into English.  That said, not all of them are immediately recognizable as jokes.  It takes a bit of research for instance to learn the humor behind the weapons being called ""twinklers"" and ""light balls,"" stemming from a case of less-than-inspired Finnish translation of Star Trek.  For me this really wasn't a problem.  In fact I rather enjoyed reading up a little on the background of Finnish Science Fiction and later going back to watch the film again so I could catch this second layer of humor that had been injected throughout the script.  But if you're one of those people who simply can't abide subtitles in film, you might want to give this a pass and wait for their next film, Iron Sky.
The second thing to keep in mind, particularly if you're a fervent fan of Star Trek, is that you need to be able to take a joke about the franchise.  I'll admit to being a devoted Trekkie (or Trekker, as that seems to be the more popular term these days) and I thought it was hilarious.  But then again I have met a few people who view any kind of jab at Spock's pseudo-scientific explanations or Kirk and Riker's habitual womanizing as a form of minor herecy.  Much of the humor stems from the fact that the way Pirk's mind works is not at all in what many would refer to as the spirit of Star Trek.  I hope that for most this won't be a reason not to pick this DVD up, but I do realize that for some of you that may be a deal breaker.

Finally, I have to say that if any of these opinions have made you unsure about picking up the DVD, I'd suggest that you go to the internet and pick up a copy of the original cut of the film.  It's free (the producers have links on their site) and comes in several flavors of subtitling.  Unlike the Imperial Edition DVD, it also features effects shots using the original Star Trek ship designs.  If after watching that you decide that perhaps you can live with the subtitles and the awesome force of raw ego that is James B. Pirk, I'd say pick up a copy of the DVD so you can get the special features, new (litigation-proof) effects, and give the film makers an incentive to bring us more films of this caliber in the future.  If you're like me and appreciate a strong witty script which isn't afraid to stop taking itself seriously every now and then coupled with professional level special effects, there's really no way you can go wrong with this film.",1253836800,49,5377,4.46067415730337
3961687,5,B002OKK2AW,"This film is brilliant.

If you are a fan of Star Treck, Babylon 5 or any science fiction and have a sense of humour, you will love this film. As a parody, this is beyond Galaxy Quest.

If you like parodies, science fiction or big space battles, you will love this film.

The Chernobyl scene is hysterical. Pirk getting in shape for conquest is really funny.

The russian leader is brilliantly protrayed.

The special effects are brilliant. They are on a par with any big budget science fiction film. The battle scenes are at least equal to and in some parts, beyond any battle scene in Star Trek, Babylon 5 or Star Wars.

The film is in Finnish, but you would still get the jokes. even without the subtitles. Every piece of dailogue is expertly carried out. The subtitles are perfect, with no mistakes.

The people who made this film are amateurs, yet they have definately shown the professionals what can be done in a film.

3961707,3,B002OKK2AW,"The film ""Star Wreck"" is a low-budget parody of ""Star Trek"" in Finnish but with English subtitles available, put together by the painstaking work of a group of very dedicated fans.

If you are both a keen Star Trek fan and have a certain type of sense of humour, you may find this very entertaining. If you don't have the right sense of humour, or if you watch it expecting the sort of production values in the official Star Trek TV shows or films or of higher budget parodies such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxy-Quest-DVD-2000/dp/B000056JQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxy Quest [DVD] [2000</a>]"" you are likely to be fairly disappointed. (Actually, Galaxy Quest itself does not survive unspoofed here. Blink and you'll miss it, but one of the key catchphrases from that film is spoofed in this one.)

The story begins as a starship's company from a future time have been stranded on 21st century Earth. The Star Trek characters they parody are a mix of ""Original Series"" and ""Next Generation"" characters: they are led by a ""Captain Pirk"" whose senior officers include an android called Commander ""Info"" and a weapons officer from an alien species with pronounced ridges on his forehead, inaptly named Commander ""Dwarf."" Obviously the latter characters are parodies of Data and Worf: one might assume from the name that ""Captain Pirk"" would be a mix of Picard and Kirk but he came over to me like a cross between Jim Kirk and Homer Simpson.

A running joke throughout the film is to take the mickey out of Science Fiction terms which will be familiar to Star Trek fans by rendering them as near-synonyms of the original expressions but using instead word which do not have the same science fiction connotations.

Hence photon torpedoes become ""light balls"" while ""Warp Drive"" becomes ""Twist Drive;""  ""Impulse Power"" becomes ""shove power"" while ""worm holes"" become ""maggot holes.""

Pirk and his crew soon realise that history has accidentally been changed and unless they do something about it there will be no future Starfleet to defend the world against a future invasion from hostile aliens called the ""Korg"" who are due to attack in their own future time. So Pirk decides that they must bring their own navy into existence - and to do this he puts together a cunning plan to make himself Emperor ...

Considering the sort of budget they had I thought the special effects in this film were surprisingly strong and one or two of the actors had great comic talent. Others did not. Some of the jokes were quite funny but personally I found certain of the other jokes to be at best  pedestrian and sometimes puerile.

Three stars for an awful lot of hard work, a storyline which does manage to keep going and stagger to a conclusion, and a certain amount of entertainment value for hardcore Star Trek fans, particularly if you also watch a certain other TV science fiction show which I will not name to avoid a spoiler. There will be a target market segment who love this. If you're not in that target segment, leave it well alone.",1423526400,,3082,4.900191938579654

Well, I guess this was their practice piece.

Satire is easy, but good satire is very hard - at best, it stays just close enough to the original to show the inanity that was there in the first place. Although the CGI effects were great, the script just didn't live up to it. And, if they had studied Sigourney Weaver's role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxy-Quest/dp/B00AEFY3MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxy Quest</a>, they could have done a lot more with the sorely under-used officer babe.

So, even with Captain Fukov and all the rest, it just didn't do a lot for me. Worth seeing, maybe, but preferably if you're not the one paying.

3961731,3,B002OKK2AW,"If you watch the Special Features, you will hear either the director or one of the writers, perhaps both state that the inspiration behind Star Wreck was to produce a really good giant space battle and make it more like a real movie and less like all the other fan boi stiff already out there. In these two goals the Finnish crew and cast achieved a very reasonable effort. Consider that Star Trek, Babylon 5 , Star Wars and most of the rest of the genre of serious space movies are in major need for satire and Star Wreck does fill a niche.

The jokes either do not translate well or are not that good. The names for the main space weapons are my favorite joke, and I will not give them here least I spoil one of the few things that could be spoiled. Character names tend to be a bit obvious: Pirk for Kirk, Dwarf for Warf and so on. Of course the captain, here an emperor is an overweening egotistical coward and why his crew or armada has any loyalty to him is a mystery rather than part of the joke.  The is a Russian Star Ship Captain, no not Chekov but Fukov  ( the same actor will also play a briefly seen character: Festerbester, a name I only know from Mad Magazine). Fukov is something of a cast clown, but too over the top and predictable.

The plot involves a play on the time travel in the original Star Trek televise episode. Only on this version the stranded crew members from the future cannot do much of anything right to live reasonable lives (in this version they are in Finland which tends to explain why everyone speaks Finnish). So they take their future knowledge of technology to Russia and from there take over the Earth. The people of Unified Earth seems to be more interested in their continued poverty and need to eat regular so Capt Pirk, Emperor builds a huge Armada. With his 40 Space ships the mission is to find a new habitable planet. Expendable crew members are used to test planets for suitability. Red shirts never catch a break. Instead they find a slug hole (worm hole) and on the far side they will find their giant space battle.

The special effects are pretty goods. Certainly up to the standards of the original television show and better than some for the time of the movie's release 2005. Costuming is fair to better than some and while the actors are not Hollywood quality they have some moments.

Star Wreck is not a bad movie. I rather liked the FX, had little use for the jokes but think these guys did a pretty decent job. The various Space movies need a good satire. Space Balls for all its named cast and Mel Brooks magic is hardly any better. Galaxy Quest may be alone as the one satire to best get the laughs out of outer space.

My recommendation: worth a view. It is mostly family friendly. There is enough `insider' stuff to get the occasional smile. Star Wreck has some collector value, but not much entertainment value.",1405209600,,2878,4.398496240601504

The Star Trek references were easy to see, but I never watched Babylon 5, so those parts were lost on me. Even so, and even with decent effects that somehow help it feel more epic in scope, the story is dull and humorless.

Maybe it's partly a matter of the dialogue not translating well, but I doubt it. If anything, maybe the very fact that it's subtitled is the problem. Comedy is better with timing and inflection, and you really don't get that when what you read won't ever sync up with what's happening.

The creators actually state ""You can also download all the movies [through a torrent client],"" so don't feel guilty about doing so, since this currently appears to be the only way to attain them (""The Star Wreck Store is closed for renovations""). The first one (1992) is very rudimentary animation, but they gradually improve, culminating in the feature film on this DVD.

The humor is sophomoric, but given that the ""actors"" are probably sophomores (college? high school? hard to tell) with no formal dramatic education (another guess on my part), perhaps we can cut them some slack. There are occasional moments of hilarity, often from the smallest of details. Captain Pirk damaging one of the screens on the bridge in a fit of temper should at least elicit a grin.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the CGI battles are impressive. Chroma keying is also used in the film, which lends credibility to the production. Really what is holding this back from being more than 3 stars is the overall ""home movie"" feel; while somewhat charming, it becomes less so when the humor fails to work (which is often).

I forced myself to watch the entire movie but was released when it was over and hopefully never watch it again.

My only suggestion to the film makers is that instead of marketing this movie as a Sci-Fi comedy/parody, they should have sold it as a self-help, motivational video because this film is one of the best examples of what can be accomplished once you set a goal, work hard and don't give up!

I expected a half hearted hack job, but was rewarded with a well made production. Someone took some time and effort to produce outstanding visual effects. Now don't expect ILM stuff here, but it is way beyond most spoofs. The acting isn't too bad, and the blending of a couple sci-fi series' is actually written pretty good. you do have to watch the screen constantly because of the foreign language, but it beats dubbing, which can loose the actor's tone and inflection.

If you want top of the line sci-fi, buy (and pay more) for some big name studio stuff. If you want some cheap entertainment, with surprisingly good visuals, give this a try.

I bought Iron Sky before, and my son and I enjoyed it as a ""bad movie that wasn't pretending to be a good one"".  These guys know they're making terrible jokes and don't have the greatest sets.  Most of their work is done in front of a blue screen...but whoever is doing their CGI knows a bit about what they're doing.  Overall production is not far out of the basement, but again it's not billed as some blockbuster $10,000,000 movie.

As a movie, though, it was funny enough and we laughed many times (mostly at how bad it was, but how stupid the main character was (stupid as in he's written to be a dumb guy).  If you want to watch a bad movie, and don't mind subtitles this would be good for you.

If someone had researched that subject it could have potentially led to an interesting movie. This was not the case with Iron Sky. There wasn't much sci-fi to the movie. There was no comedy that I could discern. The acting was bland and pointless. There was no plot. I guess I just didn't get it.

After seeing Iron Sky I wasn't planning on wasting a lot of time on Star Wreak. I watched about 20 minutes of it, reading the subtitles, and I could see that this was more of the same so it too was tossed in the trash.

This was produced by the folks who would later on produce ""Iron Sky"". This movie makes fun of a couple of well known Science Fiction TV shows. One is quite obvious, the other, I won't mention.

The story-line is actually quite well done and the special effects were just about as realistic as the rest of typical Sci-Fi shows. If you love space battles, this is the movie to see! Which is quite suprising since this is created by fans on a shoe-string budget. There were a few places where the frame-rate stuttered. But for the most part, you don't notice the glitches.

3961817,4,B002OKK2AW,"Wow, was I surprised when I finally saw this.  As you probably already know, it's a Star Trek/Babylon 5 parody, with it's own unrelated storyline.

What really impresses me are the special effects.  Given this was done with a sub-Hollywood budget, the special effects are 10 times better than anything you'll see in the crap Sci-Fi Channel keeps cranking out.

Once they leave Earth, the movie becomes basically one long space battle.  Of course there's more mixed in, but this has to be the most spaceship battle-packed film ever made.  I'm a major junkie for spaceship battles, and was totally sated!  They had a little fun with the differing technology of ST and B5, too.  There are a few ""oops"" moments that are good for a genuine chuckle, and lead to some great moments during the battles.

The comedy is a little hit or miss, but there are genuine laughs.  The translators (subtitles only, I'm afraid,) seemed to make sure the puns came through properly.  For example, the B5 Mimbari are called Minibar.  There are countless name plays like this and they all work.  Kudos to the translators.

It's all done lightheartedly, yet the space action sequences leave nothing wanting.  Unless you're a complete anal retentive, you won't notice or care about the lack of that last itty bitty detail of model shading that a $200K budget buys.  This just looks really good.

As many have said, the bad acting is a let-down, and the early plot is rather a stretch.  But you have to keep in mind that this is a comedy about something that's total escapism in the first place, so I don't mind that it's not Citizen Kane.

If you think you'd enjoy a funny ST/B5 parody, or just a funny Sci-Fi movie, definitely get this!",1344816000,6,1711,4.662207357859532

Some of the acting wasn't bad, but there was room for a bit of improvement.  I also wasn't terribly fond about certain parts of the story.  I don't want to ruin the movie with spoilers, but I would have changed some things, especially in the beginning.  The special effects weren't great, but they were more than acceptable given that it is a low-budget parody and the music was also okay too.  All things considered it wasn't a bad movie, but it left me wanting more from it.  If you are a fan of Star Trek and Babylon 5 don't let my 3 star rating keep you from watching it.

The one thing that i liked very very much in this movie was the space battle which was done very very well one of the highlights of this movie.

What's also exciting is that a low budget, fan-made, independent film now has access to CGI levels that rival some big budget films. I look forward to the day when immersive, photorealistic imagery isn't chained to multi-million dollar blockbusters, but can be used to augment smaller indie films and fan productions like this.

  The movie is best viewed after watching the first five star wreck films, however silly they may be, because there are a number of running gags and references in SW:VI that are funnier when fully understood. Plus, these are all watchable for free on the Star Wreck website so it won't cost you extra. That being said, this film can be viewed with no previous experience and still be enjoyable. Well, at least look up the plot for Star Wreck V so you know the premise...

  It is a rather dark comedy in many ways, and oddly enough may have you hoping a horrible death befalls the main character (protagonist doesn't quite fit). I found it laugh out loud funny in many places, and at the very least engrossing the rest of the time. As an American watching this film, one of the more subtly amusing things I noticed was how the Finns portrayed the Russians as drunken fools who tend to build somewhat shoddy machinery (we as Americans at least make them competent at evil schemes). Of course there's lots of up front comedy as well, often involving leaders who are incompetent/overzealous/egotistical, or the underlings who have to suffer cruel, predestined fates as cannon fodder (the idea, not Private Cannon Fodder).

  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a unique comedy, wants an actual parody, and/or is a major fan of Star Trek. It is simply too well done to pass up, and is a fine addition to the sci-fi section of your movie collection.",1279497600,10,2003,4.782608695652174
