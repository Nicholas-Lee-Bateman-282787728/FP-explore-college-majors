8675388,3,B00MZ3X566,"I would give this anime 3.5 stars. Its genuinely sweet and has a decent story. Its by no means mind blowing, a little generic at times, and the ending is very anti-climatic. However it does have a complete story (no cliffhanger), a few 'twists', and the relationships are heartwarming. It reminds me of Red Date Girl if you've seen that. It follows a girl who suddenly finds out she is a princess and has 5 guardians sworn to protect her from harm. They use magical abilities to protect her families seals that guard an ancient power that must not be released. A group of badies shows up to take the power and chaos ensues. Over time one of the guardians begins to lose control over himself and the main girl realizes she loves him and wants to protect him too. The romance is well done in my opinion but only because they actually confess to each other instead of dancing around it forever like most romance anime. The last 4 episodes are focused on the romance and spoiler alert... They kiss about 3 times. The show has 24 episodes and the dub is well done. But really this story could've been told in 12-13 episodes. You could watch the first 4 and the last 4 and pretty much get it. All in all, if you've seen everything else and want to watch an okay romance/action anime... this will suffice.",1447891200,2,1298,4.435146443514644
