8670012,4,B00M3FK6VS,"Zindagi Gulzar Hai is a great Pakistani serial about love and family life. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry, but its greatest asset is that it will make you THINK!  It  addressed so many  feminists/family issues, i.e .spousal  obedience vs freedom of thought and expression  and trust, issues that all cultures, particularly non-Western  cultures, grapple with. Some of the best Pakistani actors performed in this drama. The two main protagonists played by Pakistan's heart throb  Fawad Khan and the very capable Sanam Saaed  as Zaran and Kashaf , informed the waiting audiences that honesty, patience, love and respect in family relationships are still important for the success of any healthy martial relationship. Although many will probably find Kashaf (the wife)  to be one miserable character, Raffia, (her mother) did manage to have a calming effect on her and taught her by example and counseling what marriage and life in general requires for success.. Everything about this serial is praiseworthy.  I know that it won many well deserved LUX awards.  This family drama is well worth watching.",1506643200,,1116,5.110497237569061
8670013,3,B00M3FK6VS,"Although in all candor, I technically did NOT buy this item&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zindagi-Gulzar-Hai/dp/B00M3FK6VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zindagi Gulzar Hai</a>&nbsp;on Amazon, because I DID see this show (or at least 8-9 episodes of the 26 episodes) on Netflix, I'm still reviewing it anyway.

I came across this Pakistani TV serial on Netflix while searching for TV shows or movies that my mom and I could watch together.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zindagi-Gulzar-Hai/dp/B00M3FK6VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zindagi Gulzar Hai</a>&nbsp;is the story of Kashaf, a hardworking, studious & responsible girl, the eldest of 3 girls, from a poor and traditional Muslim family (her father has 2 wives -- he married a 2nd time to have a son, after his first wife, Kashaf's mother gave birth to three daughters and no sons) and Zaroon, a playboy, and generally ne'er-do-well (okay maybe he's not THAT bad -- but he IS an irresponsible party-boy & play-boy!) from a pretty rich and modern/liberal family.

As far as I know, this show is supposed to be about the romance between 2 people from ""different sides of the tracks"".............yet after seeing around 8 or 9 episodes, I didn't see any signs of any such mutual romance. Rather, it seemed to be all one-sided, the romantic gestures coming solely from Zaroon's end, while Kashaf always treated him like some dirt to be scraped off the bottom of her shoe. Granted, I only saw 8-9 episodes, but my mom, who kept watching after I'd stopped, and saw the entire 26-episode series, said that Kashaf continued acting the same way (cold, aloof & nasty) towards Zaroon until almost the very end of the show.

Personally I did not like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zindagi-Gulzar-Hai/dp/B00M3FK6VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zindagi Gulzar Hai</a>. I really liked, even LOVED Kashaf's mother, and sisters, but that's about it. Its not that this is necessarily a BAD show, per s, I just didn't much care for it. Although I liked it (or thought I liked it) initially, eventually Kashaf's constant grumbling and her nasty attitude towards Zaroon (who after his one mistake [and not even a big or intentional mistake!] tried so hard to make amends, and be nice to Kashaf -- only for her to rebuff him at every turn!) really started getting on my nerves, and I needed to take a break. I'd originally planned to go back and watch the rest later, but my mom wanted to keep watching (to see what happpens) and said she'd still watch it again with me later, whenever I wanted.

However, in the meantime, I came across the EXCELLENT Hindi TV serial ""Khelti Hai Zindagi Aankh Micholi"" also on Netflix, and when my mom finished THIS show (because I didn't want to make her stop in the middle of wherever/whatever point in the show she was, and go back to episode 8 or 9, and start over), and told me that Kashaf was/acted the same until almost the very end, I didn't really feel like going back and watching the rest of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zindagi-Gulzar-Hai/dp/B00M3FK6VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zindagi Gulzar Hai</a>

So when my mom finished&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zindagi-Gulzar-Hai/dp/B00M3FK6VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zindagi Gulzar Hai</a>, rather than resuming the show where I'd left off, I started watching ""Khelti Hai Zindagi Aankh Micholi"" with her instead -- and I'm glad I did, because, in my honest opinion, it is MUCH, MUCH BETTER series than this one. I just wish it would be released to DVD (or Blu-Ray) and available on Amazon. Because as far as I know, Netflix is currently the only place to see ""Khelti Hai Zindagi Aankh Micholi"" with English subtitles (since I only know/understand a few words and phrases in Hindi) and unfortunately Netflix has cut out many great scenes from the show  (in order to condense 83 episodes of around 25 minutes each -- to 42 episodes of around 40 minutes each)

Nevertheless, I still like (actually LOVE) that series a LOT more than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zindagi-Gulzar-Hai/dp/B00M3FK6VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zindagi Gulzar Hai</a>!!

8670014,5,B00M3FK6VS,"This title by far is one of the best tv shows I have had the privilege to watch.  It has an excellent script, dialogues between the characters have been handled with so much care, camera work, sets, editing, direction and above all the casting is flawless.  It's one of its kind and no regrets watching it multiple times.  It is available on Netflix, if you can find a copy, it's worth purchasing.",1494633600,,397,4.486111111111111

8670016,4,B00M3FK6VS,"Best thing about pakistani serials is that you know you are going to find good romance. And both the lead actors are outstanding. I have kind of got a crush on Fawad Khan after watching it. OMG! The intensity of his gaze. Wow! He reminded me of Shahrukh khan.
He is already the king of romance in Pakistan i guess and now India is all set to welcome the new king! He is a great actor. The best thing is his good looks doesn't overshadow his acting talent.
I have been searching for all his stuff after watching Khoobsurat( his first indian movie).
The actress and all supporting cast is also great. Sorry but i cant think beyond Fawad Khan! :-) he sure is going to bea great success in india.",1411516800,3,692,4.290076335877862
