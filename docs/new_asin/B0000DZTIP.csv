1930018,5,B0000DZTIP,"I accidentally recorded this film on VHS video tape about seventeen years ago from TV and I have taken special care of it ever since. The fact that it is finally being released on DVD is like a dream come true. It's one of those rare movies that capture the innocence of a bygone era, a time when excellent, feel good, family movies were made. It is with such movies that Disney defined the term family entertainment and that made a whole lot of difference to those of us that grew up with these films. Call it nostalgia if you will but movies are about entertainment and to me entertainment means that you can let yourself go for 90 minutes or so and travel to the faraway places in your imagination where the burdens of everyday life are nonexistent. Any movie that can achieve this is- to me- well worth a place in my collection. The Gnome Mobile is definitely one of those films and I would be a happy man if my son would grow up watching films like TGM rather than all the violent stuff that is so popular among youngsters nowadays.",1077840000,72,1037,4.350515463917525

1930020,5,B0000DZTIP,"walter Brennan is charming in this tale as the old man who sees and befriends the Gnomes, and ends up stealing them.  In the process he gets locke dup., because people think he is insane, as he cleaverly escapes.  Also Richard Deacon is very funny and charming in it as well, as one of the guys trying to steal the little people.  There's a neat chase scene, and a wonderful rooantic scene with the male and female gnomes dancing in the end, with beautiful fairylike costumes.",1045094400,2,476,4.511627906976744

They'll be no more soft porn in my house ! I'm saddened my daughter watched it over n over - I can only imagine - with all those women an orgy ??? I've gone back to radio shows.

If you have kids, really from age 14 on down to little ones, and haven't seen this, it's GREAT.  I think this was one of the last ones Walt Disney himself had a hand in producing.

1930099,5,B0000DZTIP,I love this old movie and so do my kids. It is a Disney movie filled with singing that tells a great story and imparts a great opportunity for a teaching lesson to not listen to strangers (a stranger calls the little girl and tells her there has been an accident. She believes the lie and trouble follows). It is old so don't expect HD but it is still good quality and very watchable even on my large screen tv.,1449792000,,411,4.15

1930164,4,B0000DZTIP,"This 1967 film is one of the last that Walt Disney personally produced.  It also has the distinction of being the last film Ed Wynn made (he died of throat cancer before the movie was released).  Sadly, it also served as Matthew Garber's last film (he died from pancreatitis at the age of 21).
The plot is limited in scope, detailing the finding of two gnomes, losing said gnomes, regaining said gnomes and relocating them to a forest free from logging in perpetuity.  It stars three time Oscar winning actor Walter Brennan in duo roles (clearly, he had fun making this movie).  Brennan plays a wealthy businessman named D.J. Mulrooney and a 900 year old gnome named Knobby.  Complications occur when the two gnomes are kidnapped and Mulrooney puts his head of security (Richard Deacon as Ralph Yarby) on the case.  Instead of helping, Yarby immediately has Mulrooney abducted and confined to an asylum without due process.  It's up to Mulrooney's two grandchildren to help him escape, track down the misappropriated gnomes, and play matchmakers.  There's a dandy car chase and lots of good humor.

In the vast collection of Disney films, this entry is a trifle, easily overlooked; not many know of its existence.
It was never destined to be a classic; nonetheless, it is highly entertaining.",1421452800,,1292,4.889908256880734

Still a good film.

Though the quality at first had me a little worried (with the black splotches that shows in old films). However, most of that goes away when the beginning credits end and the movie starts up.

I loved how the grandfather cared about both of his grandchildren and was willing to do what it took to keep his promise to the gnomes. The children were delightful (and although some of the lines felt a little forced) they did pretty good for their age.
It was fun to see Jasper again and watch as the lady gnomes made a mad dash for him at the end. I'd always found that part rather amusing when I was a kid.

All in all, the movie is safe, and a good show for little kids.",1384560000,,722,4.099290780141844

1930341,2,B0000DZTIP,"This movie was actually something of a disappointment for me. It moved rather slowly, and to be honest I was kind of glad when it ended. The story is about this rich lumber owner named Mr. Mulrooney, and he's having his grand kids from England come over to visit him. The grandchildren are the kids from Marry Poppins, that's actually how they're introduced too. So Mulrooney takes the kids to a forest he owns for a picnic and while he and the grandson set up camp, the granddaughter goes off for a walk and comes upon this gnome who asks for her help. She rushes back to get her grandfather and brings him back to the gnome. As it turns out the gnome's grandfather is dying. Gnomes only die if they've given up the will to live and the grandfather has given up the will to live because he and his grandson are the last gnomes in the forest and he will never see his grandson married. The grandfather offers to take the two to another forest where there might be more gnomes and they agree to go with them to this forest in the grandfather's car, now effectively, the gnome mobile. The party has to stop off at a hotel for the night and grandfather gnome gets angry at Mr. Mulrooney who gets angry enough to call off the trip and storms out of the room. A travelling freak show owner happens to pass by as this happens and see the gnomes. He then proceeds to kidnap them as they will make for an interesting new attraction. When Mr. Mulrooney finds out the gnomes are missing he calls his security team to help find them, but when his employee hears what he has to say he thinks he's gone mad and has him put in an insane asylum. His grandkids break him out and they go retrieve the gnomes and get to the forest, where the young gnome finds some girl gnomes to fight over him and they all live happily ever after.

The acting in this movie was horrible. It was so forced and stereotyped and fake, it was almost painful to watch. This film is by Disney, and because of that I was quite disappointed with the overall quality. Darby O'Gill and the Little People was also a Disney film about faeries and it was quite well done so we know they are capable,  but this is definitely b film material. The songs were cheesy, but I'm less distraught about that as many b film songs are usually quite poorly done. Many parts of the plot weren't given enough explanation. Some scenes seemed to flow along as they did because it would best suit what happened next and not so much because it was a logical scene that fit into an overall plot. Some of the actions taken by people in response to the gnomes, for example, were too extreme or convenient to be taken seriously by the audience. The special effects are pretty good and the guy who does the voice for the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland makes an appearance as one of the gnomes, I think that's all that can be said for this movie. All in all, ok for an initial viewing, but definitely not a keeper.",1285977600,2,2946,4.306306306306307

It still looks decent since Disney is a big company, but considering this is one of their best classics from their golden age you would think they would have given it a better DVD release then this.
Note: I went to AmazonUK and purchased the PAL DVD of this and that is much better. The PAL English copies(if your player will play them)of Disney's 'One of Our Dinosaurs','Blackbeard' and 'Gnomemobile',actually look better. The DVD's look like they are transfered from film and audio is better.

Jasper the gnome and his grandfather, Knobby, fear they are the last of their kind, and this just won't do, as Jasper desperately needs to find a mate. And so, the Mulrooney's set out on a mission to help the little people, portrayed much like 2 foot hillbillies, find more of their kind among their grandfather's vast land of redwoods. Along the way however, they'll have to deal with a sneaky freakshow owner and the folks at the ""crazy house"" who are set to assign D.J. to a rubber room under the orders of his own employees. After all, there's no such thing as gnomes, right? It's a fun, energetic, musical road trip, heavy on the '60's Disney flair and starring ""the Mary Poppins kids"", Matthew Garber and Karen Dotrice, and Walter Brennan in a dual role! We also get the always delightful Ed Wynn in his final role as a gnome with a big surprise for Jasper and Knobby and one of the most exhilarating sequences in Disney history!

""The Gnome Mobile"" is fondly remembered by a great many people who were lucky enough to grow up with Disney live-action as well as the more popular animated features. The Disney Channel showed this one quite often, and it was so enjoyable that you could watch it again and again. Leave it to Disney to make an era like the '60's actually look appealing. Directed by Disney legend Robert Stevenson, ""The Gnome Mobile"" may not be the masterpiece ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" is, but it is definitely a wonderful Disney comedy in its own right, full of color, magic, and charm. The DVD is without extras and presented in fullscreen, but don't let that stop you. This one should be in everyone's collection! I'd make some other recommendations here, but basically, if it's Disney and was made during the '60's, you should get it. Heck, if it's Disney and was made before the Disney Channel went tween, you should get it. However, I'll make some more specific and kinda relevant recommendations anyway: Mary Poppins, Darby O'Gill and the Little People, The Shaggy Dog, The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin, The Happiest Millionaire, The Parent Trap, That Darn Cat, The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes,  The Misadventures of Merlin Jones, the Monkey's Uncle, Now You See Him, Now You Don't, The Ugly Dachshund, The Strongest Man in the World, the Love Bug, Blackbeard's Ghost, and those are just a start.

1930376,4,B0000DZTIP,"""The Gnome Mobile"" is a fun light-hearted look at ... the blindness of greed, the innocence of children, the Irish, and ... gnomes.

Made shortly after ""Mary Poppins"" was made, ""The Gnome Mobile"" stars ""The Mary Poppins Kids"" Jane and Michael Banks, who here are Elizabeth and Rodney.  Elizabeth and Rodney are British sister and brother who fly into San Francisco to visit their very wealthy American businessman grandfather.  Once there, the three of them go for a car ride (in Grandfather's beautiful old Rolls Royce) deep into the forest for a picnic lunch ... and that is when the fun starts.

Living in that forest are two gnomes (little people): Jasper and his grandpa Knobby.  The two gnomes are very worried that they may in fact be the last gnomes in existence ... and when Jasper sees Elizabeth (she had wandered into the woods a little) he decides to break one of the gnome rules and show himself to her.  He (Jasper) has heard that other gnomes may be living in other far away forests ... could she help?  Elizabeth hurries and fetches Rodney and her grandfather, they meet Knobby, and the five of them then embark on a mission (in Grandfather's Rolls Royce, which Elizabeth now calls ""The Gnome Mobile"") to find other gnomes ... especially a girl gnome who Jasper can marry.

It's a fun journey.  They encounter some trouble along the way, but it's not too too bad, and it does bring out some more fun.  The ending, I will say, is a very happy one.

The children (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) are pretty good here ... maybe not quite as good as they are in ""Mary Poppins"" but adorable and fun none-the-less.  Walter Brennan plays the grandfather (he also plays Knobby the old gnome) and he is excellent.  The bit players ... actors and actresses who have only small parts in the movie ... are also top-notch.  And the special effects do a good job of making the gnomes look like they really are only a foot tall.  There's only one song in the movie ... but it's a good one.

But ""The Gnome Mobile"" is sort-of a hidden gem ... a good fun movie to watch for those who happen to find it.",1216598400,,2103,4.494736842105263

1930389,3,B0000DZTIP,"This movie is a cute story about a grandfather and his grandchildren encountering gnomes in the redwoods of Northern California.  The story is suitable for children of all ages.  Adults who remember this movie when it was first released in the 1960's will enjoy reliving the memory.

Walter Brennan was going strong in 1967 when he played D. J. Mulrooney, a wealthy man who made a fortune in lumber.  One of the casualties of his wealth was many of the great redwoods of Northern California.  Mulrooney is traveling with his grandchildren Rodney Winthrop (the late Matthew Garber, in his third and final movie role, the first two also being Disney movies, ""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" and ""Mary Poppins"") and Elizabeth Winthrop (Karen Dotrice, who appeared in the same three movies as Matthew Garber and continues to act).  When the three stop to eat in a grove of redwoods, they discover gnomes Knobby (also played by Walter Brennan) and Jasper (Tom Lowell, who appeared as Canoe in the 1965 version of ""That Darn Cat"" and also appeared in ""The Boatniks"").  The children and their grandfather learn that Jasper and Knobby are the only gnomes left in that area of the redwoods.  They also learn that Knobby blames Mulrooney for destruction of the redwoods.  Mulrooney offers to take the gnomes to another grove of redwoods where he is sure that there are more gnomes, including female gnomes!  Let the mayhem begin!

The gnomes are spotted by a combination con man (played by Sean McClory, who starred in many well-known films, such as ""The Happiest Millionaire,"" ""The Quiet Man"" and ""David and Bathsheba"").  Another Disney regular, Norman Grabowski, appears as a male nurse at the institution where they confine Mulrooney because anyone who sees gnomes must be crazy.  The fun spirals higher when the children come to spring grandpa from the institution and the reunited family charge off to recover the kidnapped gnomes.  Another highlight of this portion of the film is a fun chase scene, though the close-ups look fake, typical in movies of this era.  The conclusion is both fun and a bit weak, depending on whether you are looking at the specific parts of the conclusion, or the final scenes, where the special effects of the gnomes are quite excellent.

This film also marked the final appearance of funnyman Ed Wynn, who appears all too briefly in this film.

This movie was made in the transition period for Disney Studios between the time when Disney was known for great movies and the time when Disney churned out a bunch of inexpensively made movies that tried, sometimes successfully, to capture the old Disney magic.  This film partially succeeds in capturing that magic, though much of the credit must be given to Walter Brennan and the Disney regulars.  The special effects at the end of the movie were also enjoyable and lent a nice magical air to the film.

The overall result is a serviceable family film.  The story is captivating for younger children in the age range between 4 years old and 10 years old, and the movie contains enough humor that parents will find smiles throughout the film.  I recommend this movie to fans of older Disney movies, fans of Walter Brennan, fans of gnomes and fans of the cute children from Mary Poppins.  Of course, families with young children will like this one too.

As many other reviewers have pointed out, this movie is presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio - meaning full screen.  However, this movie was filmed in 1.75:1 aspect ratio.  The studio used a technique called pan and scan to cut the film to 1.33:1, which is unfortunate for those of us watching the film.  Would I have rated this movie four stars if the aspect ratio would have been wide screen?  I do not know.  Maybe.  Perhaps one day we will all know for sure.  Until the day when someone wakes up and realizes there is more to see than meets the eye, we are stuck with this version.

For those of you who are okay with full screen, enjoy!  For those of us with wide screen televisions and a full screen movie, well, good luck!",1187827200,2,4050,4.731811697574893

1930414,4,B0000DZTIP,"Walt Disney had a wonderful taste for the tales and lore of leprechauns and gnomes and his talents of bringing them to film are proven most successful with his productions of ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" as well as this enchanting picture, ""The Gnome-Mobile.""  The talents of child actors, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber  (""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Three Lives of Thomasina"") are once again called upon in this delightful tale.  Walter Brennan plays D.J. Mulrooney, the incredibly wealthy grandfather of the two children, who are visiting him while their parents are in Europe.  Brennan is the head of a large timber corporation and owns a Rolls Royce, of which the children call ""the gnome mobile"" later in the picture.  During a picnic lunch, Karen goes exploring in the woods and is pleasantly greeted by a young man named Jasper, who is a real and genuine gnome.  As the story progresses, Karen introduces her grandfather and brother to Jasper and he takes them to meet his grandfather, also played by Walter Brennan, who does a great job.  The gnomes explain that they are the last of the gnomes in this forest, and want to find a young female gnome for young Jasper to marry.  D.J. and his grand kids agree to help, so they're off in the ""gnome-mobile"" in search of more gnomes.  Disney's dvd transfer is quite good, with a few glitches here and there, and the picture is in full-screen.  I highly recommend ""The Gnome-Mobile,"" especially to young viewers and fans of the classic Disney live-action films.  An enchanting tale that will add some whimsy to your dvd library.",1142380800,9,1586,4.794117647058823
1930415,4,B0000DZTIP,"I have for many years enjoyed this movie, and now that it has finally made it to DVD I had to pick it up.  My 3 year old has watched for the last 4 days straight and loves it.

The plot of the movie is fairly unique and really enjoyable.  I was surprised to see that the movie is based on a story by Upton Sinclair, who knew?  It also packs quite a cast.  Walter Brennan plays two key roles and does them both very well.  Although I would say that his Mulrooney character does have an anger problem that my child picked up on pretty quick.

The film also uses the Disney stable of actors to fill out the cast from the adults like Ed Wynn and the child stars:  Matthew Garber and Karen Dotrice.

The children really are the stars of the show and deservedly so.  These two actors had been in two other movies by this point.  1.  The three lives of Thomasina (disney movie), and 2. Mary Poppins (one of my all time favorites)

An interesting side bar to this is that this would be the last movie for child actor Matthew Garber and he would die under mysterious conditions just a few years later.  It's an interesting story the curious could look up.

Over all this is a great Disney live action movie that should get more respect than it does, and I hope that now it has made it to DVD more people will take notice of it.  My only complaints are that:

  1.  No Widescreen

  2.  The story is not long enough

  3.  No Bonus features

1930431,4,B0000DZTIP,"THE GNOME MOBILE reunites Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber in their third and final Disney film pairing.  Walter Brennan impresses in two roles with fine support from Tom Lowell and Sean McClory.

Elizabeth and Rodney (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) are spending the summer with their tycoon grandfather D.J. Mulrooney (Walter Brennan).  Stopping off in the Redwood Forest for a picnic, Elizabeth meets Jasper (Tom Lowell) and Knobbie (Brennan once more), who claim to be the last surviving gnomes.

Promising to help them find more of their own kid, D.J. and the children bundle up Knobbie and Jasper, their destination the Virgin Forest many miles away.  A stop at a motel blows their cover and the gnomes are abducted by freak show owner Horatio Quaxton (Sean McClory).  The plot thickens when D.J. is thrown into a madhouse!

The story quickly rushes to it's eventful conclusion with Jasper finding the girl-gnome of his dreams (Cami Sebring).

Too bad the movie's in full-screen but never mind.  Alas the Disney people are doing this with more and more frequency in their back-catalogue titles.

An entertaining tale with the MARY POPPINS kids!  Based on the book by Upton Sinclair.  With Ed Wynn, Maudie Prickett, Norman Grabowski, Ellen Corby, Susan Flannery and Richard Deacon.",1109203200,41,1288,5.110047846889952
1930432,3,B0000DZTIP,"While DJ Mulrooney is picnicking in the woods with his grandchildren, his granddaughter discovers a couple of gnomes living there, who think they are the only gnomes left in the world. JC agrees to help them find other gnomes and all kinds of complications ensue, including stolen gnomes, a stay in and escape from an insane asylum, car chases and a race to catch a ""greased"" gnome.

The Gnome-Mobile is a typical Disney Film from the `60's - silly but lots of fun to watch. Walter Brennan is great as both DJ and one of the gnomes, while Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (listed in the credits as the kids from Mary Poppins) are okay as his grandchildren. It's fun spotting the character actors who seem to appear in just about every comedy made in the 60's including Richard Deacon, Frank Cady, Ellen Corby and Charles Lane. Ed Wynn appears all to briefly as a gnome.

Disney studios is truly a Jekyll and Hyde - one moment giving us great Vault Disney widescreen deluxe treatments, the next moment trashing their product into standard frame abominations. And it's always done strictly at random, with no rhyme or reason to it.

In this case, it looks like they took the title too literally - they compacted  the Gnome Mobile movie down into gnome size! The Disney decision makers must be nuts - they seem to have little clue of the goldmine they're sitting on, and the possible lifetime customers they're ticking off every time they pull this lame standard frame stunt.

1930435,5,B0000DZTIP,"Robert Stevenson's delightful little 1967 film deserves to be seen in a widescreen edition, but your kids won't really care.  The catchy music and wonderful theme song, ""In the Gnome Mobile"" will have you tapping your foot for sheer joy, and perhaps you will be swept away in a wave of nostalgia at seeing the last teaming of Matthew Garber and Karem Dotrice, considerably more mature than they were three years earlier in Stevenson's MARY POPPINS.  Robert Stevenson had a lovely way with directing children--he made Elizabeth Taylor a star in the Orson Welles JANE EYRE--and his touch is surefire with young Garber and Dotrice.  Sad to think that this was his last film (he died in 1977) but it is a memorable one, not least for Walter Brennan's dual role--wonder if he got two salaries, he deserved them!

Watching the THE GNOME-MOBILE, even in its mutilated pan and scan version, turns into a whole snapshot album of treats.  Fans with long memories will recall Sean McGlory from two classic John Wayne films of the early 1950s--THE QUIET MAN in which he played Owen Glynn, and also the rarely seen today ISLAND IN THE SKY, in which he played Wayne's co-pilot.  Disney fans will recall he had appearances in both FOLLOW ME, BOYS and THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE.  He died too soon, in 2003, without the Disney Legend status he deserved, but his performance here as Horatio Quaxton is filled with generous touches and a lot of old school hilarity.

The beautiful redwood forest at the beginning and the end of the film, shows a Disney comfortable with location filming.  Wonder where these sequences took place?  Must be somewhere in Northern California or Oregon?",1105660800,14,1662,4.840989399293286

""The Gnome Mobile"" is an incredibly entertaining film with two first-rate performances by the legendary Walter Brennan and excellent special effects (for the mid-'60's).  But it's all for naught with this shabby presentation.  I've already been ripped-off by the awful pan-and-scan copy of ""Follow Me, Boys"" I bought against my better judgment.  Never again.  I'm boycotting all Disney DVD's not presented in widescreen, no matter how much I love the film.  I encourage everyone else to do so also.
Please, Michael Eisner.  You've ruined the greatest entertainment company in history.  Your theme parks are going bust, your live-action films (excluding the ""Freaky Friday"" remake and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") are awful and just about every post-Katzenburg animated film has been an absolute bust.  And now you've lost Pixar, the only cash cow Disney had left.  To paraphrase Robin Williams, soon you'll only have a theme park and Kermit the Frog.  And if you keep up with the cut-rate DVD's you're now mass-producing, soon your video department will go bust as well.  Heck, even Roy Disney hates your guts.  So, how about it, Mike?  Please resign.

1930451,3,B0000DZTIP,"First of all, I only view movies that have english subtitles and/or are closed captioned.  This movie IS closed captioned!
Why is Disney releasing all these classics in a standard format?  I'd love to see them in their original form.
I first became interested in this movie, when I saw the real car in a small car museum somewhere in west Michigan several years ago, and have been looking forward to see this movie since then. It was not what I expected, as I thought it would be more action packed, but I am glad I got to view it. I felt it was not a waste of my time.
It's a movie that children can enjoy. I am an adult, and have enjoyed it myself. The only things that bothered me, was that it was a little slow, especially in the beginning, and it didn't have a lot of action. The story plot could have been a little better too. However, I suspect that it was the standard mode that impacted the movie's ability to deliver itself as it should've.
It is only one of the three films that Matthew Garber (who passed away in 1977) was on. This also contributed for my interest in this movie.
Gnome Mobile is not an ""A"" movie. It is not a Mary Poppins or the Love Bug. It is just a good nature movie to watch with your family or by yourself. If you don't have high expectations and just want to enjoy an old fashioned children movie, this might be a  good choice for you.  You may want to rent it first though.

Stunning & colorful cinematography and clever special effects both mechanical animated and forced perspective (as in Darby O'Gill) make for fun and fantasy fillled film for the entire family.

But, alas another wonderful 5 star Disney classic live action movie hacked to bits by pan & scan.  Funny how many TV shows and now most commercials are in 16 X 9 widescreen format.  Maybe now that Eisner is history, perhaps the consumer will possibly benefit.  CEO Robert Iger, do you ever bother to listen to the wishes of Region One buying consumers?  We truly thank Roy Disney and friends for keeping Uncle Walt's vision alive.

I enjoin all Region 1 consumers to remain in boycott mode until Disney studios gives ALL classic live-action movies the ""Vault Disney"" treatment.  If it's good enough for Region 2 Europe, it good enough for North America.
