1786031,5,B00006LPAY,"Whoever wrote the editorial review should watch more of the series before writing a review. First off, Jet is not a cyborg, he is a retired cop with a prostetic arm because he lost his arm in the line of duty. Also, the editor did not even mention Edward, who is the quirky hacker genius and Ein's companion aboard the Bebop. Anyway, this is a great collection if you can't afford the whole set. One of my favorites is Mushroom Samba.",1035417600,6,434,4.37037037037037
1786052,4,B00006LPAY,"Let me start by saying that you probably only want to buy this DVD if
A. You are a huge Bebop fan
B. You have a kickass sound system
C. You want something to keep you occupied till the movie comes out
D.  Combinations or all of the above
This DVD is awesome and Bebop rocks but I don't think that it has enough to earn 5 stars.  The DTS is really cool but if only it had more special features!  Maybe director interviews or cast interviews or something more.  Or even a trailer for the American version of the movie!",1043452800,5,516,4.079207920792079
1786053,5,B00006LPAY,"This series is amazing in visuals, sound, story, characters and action. All the episode are top noch...espiecially Ballad of Fallen Angels, which has an awsome gun fight at the end.",1041379200,,181,5.066666666666666
1786054,5,B00006LPAY,"I love this DVD. It's remastered sound is awsome, especially in surround sound. It gives ""Tank"" and ""Real Folk Blues"" an even better feel then before. It also contains some of the best episodes I've seen. (I've seen all except for episode #26) It even contains ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" and ""Mushroom Samba."" I would recomend this to all hard-core Bebop fans. Why did it have to end so soon?",1039996800,,391,4.6
1786055,3,B00006LPAY,"This is my favorite anime series of all time. It is a combination of many genres. Sure, you could say it was sci-fi because it all takes place in space; but all of the episodes have different themes. The characters are very real and very human, the story is emotional, and even the dubbed voices are excellent (almost a rarity in dubbed anime).
The only real point of this DVD collection was to put out a little extra something for the die-hard fans (such as myself) and re-master the sound. If you have a Dolby system, it is actually quite amazing. In fact, in an interview with director Shinichiro Watanabe, he said that he chose the episodes on the first disc for the sound.
""If my selection was based solely on personal taste, I probably would have selected bizarre stories such as episode 20 (""Pierrotm Le Fou"") and episode 6 (""Sympathy for the Devil""). But since my emphasis was on the sound, I chose episode 1 with its gun sequences and human interactions; episode 5 for the music being played; and episode 19 for its mecha action. I handled the storyboard for two of them, so I'm sure my color shows up the most in them.""
The episodes on the first disc are still some of the best in the series (though I'd rank episodes 6 and 20 above 19, personally), regardless of what influenced his decision.
The episodes on the second disc (chosen by the fans) are also the best, exactly what I would have chosen. It starts with episode 8, Waltz for Venus (featuring the voice of Maaya Sakamoto as Stella), which is my personal favorite. Then it goes to episode 17, Mushroom Samba, probably the funniest of the series, followed up with episode 24, Hard Luck Woman, one of the more emotion-provoking episodes.
If you are a fan of the series (suppose you saw it on Cartoon Network, or something) but do not have the [$$$] for the Perfect Sessions, this is an excellent alternative. If you want to get a friend of yours into the series, this is a good place to start, and if you just want some good episodes with better sound (and some awesome trailers on the second disc) then this is for you. However, it doesn't really have any extras (beyond the trailers) and if you plan on getting the whole series anyway, there's no point, which is why it's got three stars from me instead of five. It's really not for everyone. The case sure looks cool, though.",1039737600,2,2345,4.494145199063232
1786056,1,B00006LPAY,"Even though I'm a huge fan or the series, I would only recommened this dvd to most die hard bebop fans. It seems almost not worth buying but just to have it becasue the words ""cowboy bebop"" are written on it. Although the sound is amazing, it doesn't make up for the price. There are no extras at all, it seems like it was made just to milk the series as long as possible. I would  save your money until the movie comes out, that would be worth buying.",1039305600,3,452,4.078651685393258
1786057,5,B00006LPAY,I would like to say people who haven't seen this set have no opinion in judging the quality of this set. The reason I say this is because they haven't heard or seen the remixed Quality of the episodes on this disk. In other issues the episodes on this disk are very well picked and qualitable. If your looking for a gift for a Cowboy Bebop fan consider this as an excellent pick.,1038960000,,379,4.205479452054795
1786058,2,B00006LPAY,"I'll also start off by saying that I don't actually have this DVD, but I do have the Perfect Sessions, which contains all 26 episodes of the series, so I have seen all the episodes on this DVD. Yes, if you really can't afford to buy the whole show, the Best Sessions is an affordable alternative, but, in most cases, anyone who watches the Best Sessions will instantly want to see the rest of the series. So, I ask, what is the point of the Best Sessions? For all you people who want to know whether or not Cowboy Bebop is for you, I'll say this: yes, Cowboy Bebop is for everybody. You'll like it. Believe me. If you still want to see a few episodes before you make an investment, watch a few episodes of the show on Cartoon Network. (Yes, it's dub, but Cowboy Bebop is known for having one of the best anime dubs made to date.)",1038182400,2,829,4.1875
1786059,3,B00006LPAY,"Cowboy Bebop's best sessions is not really different from the six discs that make up the regular series.  The stories are not changed at all.  The dialogue, animation, and music are identically to the previously released discs.  There are no extras worth speaking of, and no alternate endings or deleted scenes.  The best sessions is just a supped up regular sessions in Dolby 5.1.  There's also a (Japanese only) DDTS track.  So, if you are considering purchasing this DVD for  ""new"" material then don't bother.  However, if you are a die hard fan, than what else can you do but click a few buttons and wait patiently for it to arrive at your doorstep.",1037836800,,653,4.666666666666667
1786060,5,B00006LPAY,"This set is excellent. I haven't watched all 6 eps yet, but I am really digging it. Love that opening music!
I disagree with a previous reviewer saying how the eps lose coherence when not seen in relation to each other, I am having no problem getting into it, and I had only seen a part of 1 episode prior to getting this set.
Needless to say I am hooked and found this a great way to introduce myself to the Bebop universe.
Highly recommended to all freshman to this class of Bebop!",1037836800,4,483,4.204301075268817
1786061,2,B00006LPAY,"I haven't seen this DVD itself, but have all eight of the ""Session"" Discs. I honestly don't see how something like this can be a good thing. Cowboy Bebop is a single, coherent story. Each episode, no matter how random it may seem, contains a reference, scene, or something so small as a gesture that builds the series as a whole. Each episode relies heavily upon the viewer having seen the previous ones. When the series is broken down into ""Best Of"" segments, it loses that quality, in effect becoming snippets of a greater whole. Yes, these snippets may be good, but they cannot possibly convey the flow of the story in the manner of the full series. I would suggest saving your money and purchasing ""Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Sessions.""",1037404800,,740,4.656488549618321

7971999,5,B00006LPAY,Great collection of a great series. Fantastic way to introduce someone to the series. Now I look forward to watching the entire run again.,1372032000,,138,4.791666666666667
7972000,4,B00006LPAY,There are four episodes Like most the second the last let me thinking always expecting to find answers in this excellent anime -,1344384000,,128,4.608695652173913
7972001,5,B00006LPAY,"If you didn't/ couldn't/ can't watch all 26 episodes of Shinichiro Watanabe's amazing Cowboy Bebop on Cartoon Network, or afford the complete, out-of-print ""perfect"" set, here's the next best thing. It's six hand-picked episodes with Dolby sound for less than the DVD of the Cowboy Bebop movie.

The Best Sessions may not be the best, but they are the best introduction to the epic anime series for those who don't like anime, and whatever one thinks of the film, most of the elements that make the show so dazzling are missing from it. The Best Sessions is a bargain priced introduction to an incredible animation triumph, from the opening titles montage blending Jonny Quest and Peter Gunn to the enchanting closing with ""The Real Folk Blues"". Not to mention the strong story lines, careful, yet jaunty animation style, witty manga dialogues, and the most realized characters in Anime. The effect is as if a graphic novel had come to life, not taken itself too seriously (the bane of most GNs), and brought a first-person perspective to an entirely alien world. Mostly it's the experience of bounty hunter- drifter Spike, sometimes his (space)shipmate Jet, later acquaintance Valentine or computer wiz-kid Edward. Regardless, the effect is dazzling. Cartoon Network again scored with this one. Hard to believe it's from 1998. But for twenty bones, here's your chance to catch the buzz with the Best Sessions.",1142294400,2,1410,5.051502145922747
7972002,5,B00006LPAY,Since I watch the DVD I made up my mind. I`m going to buy the whole series.,1127174400,,75,3.4705882352941178
7972003,2,B00006LPAY,"I rented this some time ago with the belief that it contained the ""Best Sessions"" of the series, which it's title implies. Upon watching it I found out that it actually only contains one, or maybe two, of the best episodes from the Cowboy Bebop series. One being the first episode: Asteroid Blues. The rest were on the lower or middle end of the spectrum. This doesn't even have Pierrot le Fou on it. Which is THE. BEST. episode in the Cowboy Bebop series. My advice to you: Don't even rent this. watch Cowboy Bebop on cartoon network. It's practically free (cable bill) and actually worth your time.",1091232000,4,600,4.564814814814815
7972004,5,B00006LPAY,"This Best Sessions collection of Cowboy Bebop contains 6 episodes of the series, with remastered video and a new remixed soundtrack. Most people will not feel justified in buying this set when there really is nothing new besides the soundtrack quality. For me though, I want everything Bebop I can get my greedy hands on, so when I saw it for 12 bucks I grabbed it. Yes, I have these episodes already on DVD, but to hear these great episodes on surround takes it up a notch. I feel like Bebop fans that have a good system should get this. The sound is the only reason though, as there is nothing here we haven't seen before on the other Bebop releases. The episodes contained here are ""arguably"" the best sessions, but each of them are still great. In my opinion ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" is the best session there is, and to hear the great music to it in a remixed soundtrack is amazing. But I will only recommend this collection to die-hard Bebop fans that are as obsessive as I am about watching these episodes in the best possible audio/visual quality. For those who pass on this release don't worry, you aren't missing anything new.",1087862400,15,1137,4.524271844660194
7972005,2,B00006LPAY,"This selection is at my local video store, for people who want to sample some of the most popular Cowboy Bebop episodes. But when it comes to buying this, I can't imagine why someone would go to purchase only a fraction of the series when the entire thing is available (more than twice as many episodes) for around ten more dollars. (see: The Perfect Sessions Complete Series, but be careful buying a used copy because sellers have sent incomplete versions).
The product itself is fine and the episodes are great, but it jumps around the series based on ratings and fails to show more than the highlights. It might very well be the best of the season, but it's only so good without the rest of the story.",1081382400,4,704,4.5078125
7972006,3,B00006LPAY,"I gave this a three-star rating because it is excellent, but not the best Cowboy Bebop dvd deal you can get. Look into ""Cowboy Bebop: The Perfect Sessions"" before you buy this. That dvd, which costs maybe 5-10 dollars more, has the entire 26-episode series rather than just these selected episodes. Just throwing in this warning, as I bought The Best Sessions shortly before discovering The Perfect Sessions and don't want anyone else to have to waste money if they don't have to. And besides, The Best Sessions will just leave you wanting more Bebop anyway.",1074124800,,558,4.822916666666667
7972007,5,B00006LPAY,"First of all, the DVD case is very cool and is based off of the tape that Faye Valentine watches in ""Hard Luck Woman.""  The case that has the DVDs in it fits in to a very nice slipcase.
Now, for the DVDs themselves.  The first three episodes on the first disk were picked by the director just for having the best sound.  ""Asteroid Blues"" for the gun sequences and human interactions, ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"" for the music and ""Wild Horses"" for the spaceship action.  The first two are classics, but ""Wild Horses"" suffers from a confusing plot and a really annoying character.
The second disk includes 3 episodes that the fans in Japan (Not U.S. fans) voted for.  They include the heartfelt ""Waltz for Venus"", ""Mushroom Samba"" the one where the crew trips on shrooms and ""Hard Luck Woman"" which has Faye and Ed finding out their pasts.
EXTRAS:  None, except for some trailers on the second disk, woo-hoo.(*sarcasm*)
SOUND:  Amazing, especially if you have a super cool home theater like me.
Should you buy this as your first Bebop DVD?:  I'd say no.  You should get Cowboy Bebop - Sesson 1 to get a better understanding of the series, besides it's cheaper.
So when should I buy this DVD?:
-When you have an awesome home theater
-When you don't want to spend $ on Sessions 2 and 4 just for ""Waltz"" and for ""Samba""
-When you're already familiar with Cowboy Bebop and don't want to buy Session 1 just for ""Asteroid"" and ""Ballad"".
-When you're an obsessed Bebop fan!!!
If it were up to me, I would have added such episodes as ""Pierrot Le Fou"" or ""Cowboy Funk"" instead of ""Wild Horses"" and ""Hard Luck Woman""  I think this deserves 4.5 stars, so I'm going to give it five to balance out the total score.",1055116800,5,1698,4.483766233766234
