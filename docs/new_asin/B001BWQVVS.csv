3499647,5,B001BWQVVS,"What a joy this DVD is to view.  The Bolshoi Ballet is always outstanding,
but to star a lead such as Carlos Acosta, it becomes even more enjoyable.
This dancer soars through the air and moves like a deer in flight!  If you see this DVD and like it, I recommend you also see one of Romeo and Juliet, with Acosta in a great romantic telling of the love story; his Romeo is magnificent.",1257120000,,384,4.175675675675675
3499648,3,B001BWQVVS,"I Martinez Ybor has an eloquent and favorable review with which I do not want to quibble. Just a warning: if you own the Vasiliev and/or the Mukhamedov versions, you might want to check out highlights of this version before you plunk down your money. If you do not, check highlights of those before you make a final decision.",1244592000,7,325,4.52542372881356
3499649,4,B001BWQVVS,"When Grigorovich took the challenge of choreographing Khachaturian's Spartacus - who had searched the story of this rebelled slave in Appian and Plutarch,more than in Giovaniolli's novel as basis for his ballet score -he would be the third choreographer to do so,after Yakobson in 1956 and Moiseev,in 58.
In 1963 he finally staged this 3rd productin of Spartacus,for Bolshoi. The leading role does demand an exceptional physically gifted dancer in order to give life to the extremely violent choreography with its ""jets"" and leap sequences,not to mention strength. Mikhail Lavrovsky,Vladimir Vasiliev and Irek Mukhamedov became legendary interpreters of Grigorovich's Spartacus. Two dancers,young Ivan Vasiliev - possibly one exceptional Spartacus to be - and cuban Carlos Acosta have the courage to dance the part,nowadays.
Carlos Acosta,internationally recognised ballet dancer,even foot injured,gives,live from Palais Garnier,an unforgettable interpretation of this demanding role,after Moscow and London. His generosity,his inner capability of giving the rebelious slave a soul trough dancing,is absolutely transcendent,and technically too,though injured.
His partenaire Kaptsova is neither Semenyaka nor Bessmertnova but portrays a fragile,tender Phrygia.
Allash's Aegina,quite convincing,follows Bilova's steps(she danced the two Mukhamedov versions).The weakest part is Volshkov's Crassus,far from being a cruel despot the role requires. Too young and light,is far away from Vetrov's energic,violent dancing. The orchestra...weak.
The Bolshoi corps,alas, does not bear the masculine quality male Bolshoi dancers used to have...I did think of majorettes,once or twice.",1234915200,,1674,6.314410480349345
3499650,4,B001BWQVVS,"une rvlation : Carlos Acosta. On a vraiment l'impression que le rle est fait pour lui : un visage presque brutal, viril, et un corps souple et muscl. De l'intensit, de la fougue, et une matrise absolue tant physique, gestuelle, qu'expressive. Un rgal. Belle mise en scne et partenaires efficaces : que du bonheur.",1232496000,4,313,4.814814814814815
3499651,4,B001BWQVVS,"The review of this DVD on this site by the person from India makes no sense. I was fortunate to see this performance live at the Paris Opera Ballet. It was performed by the Bolshoi Ballet's main company and Grigorovich supervised the final stage rehearsals. Carlos Acosta appeared as a guest artist and was coached in Paris by Mikhail Lavrovsky, one of the great interpreters of the role. Acosta and Nina Kaptsova were SUPERB - their performances are different from - but equal to - those of Lavrovsky & Bessmertnova and Vasiliev and Maximova. Acosta was stunning in his intensity and power.  He was incredibly  expressive. Unfortunately, he was dancing with a foot injury and so this performance is likely not his best technically. But that does not matter. Buy this DVD if you want to see a great interpretation of one of the few great roles for male ballet dancers. (The dancers who portray Crassus and Aegina are dreadful compared to others who have danced these roles. You can fast forward through their sections.)",1229558400,5,1019,4.817142857142857
3499652,1,B001BWQVVS,"I bought this ballet with much expectation. Unlike the Irek Mukhamedov, Alexander Vetrov, Maria Bilova, Lyudmilla Semenyak Bolshoi version which is truly beautiful, particularly in Act III, this ballet is unwatchable. The Miami reviewer gives a glowing two paras in the first review  of this version, and in the third para pans it bare. There is no method or story in the ballet. I am sure Bolshoi gave its name to the performance for a fee, providing the ballet with novice dancers. I am certain there is  no Grigovitch choreography followed by this ensemble. This is a NO NO purchase!",1229126400,7,586,4.85
3499653,5,B001BWQVVS,"Carlos Acosta IS Spartacus.  The identification of role and dancer is absolute and all encompassing. There is passion, power, subtlety, conviction unmatched elsewhere.  A big dancer in dances that demand big ample movement, Mr. Acosta's every pore, every muscle convey the character's deep emotions and committment to great, sweeping ideals.  The technique is phenomenal.  Ironically, what one remembers as most riveting is the eyes.  There lives Spartacus, fighter, hero and very much a lover. Given the arduous role, Russian ballet has cast it always from strength, even if in subtly different interpretations:  Vassiliev and Mukhamedov come to mind. Carlos Acosta, Cuban born and trained, at the summit of his breathtaking powers, a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet, achieves greatness guesting with the Bolshoi at the Palais Garnier in Paris; never have dancer and part seemed so intimately matched in this ballet. This dvd is worth acquiring for this performance alone if for nothing else.

The other roles are also well danced. Crassus, at one time memorably performed by a haughty Maris Liepa, is here also outstandingly danced by Alexander Volchkov, but with a different slant, more venal, corrupt, sensual, than fascist. Nina Kaptsova is superb: a lyrical, eloquent, vulnerable Phrygia.  Maria Allash is a delicious Aegina, a knowing courtesan and virtuoso secure in her powers to seduce and dance. Alexei Ratmansky's Bolshoi shines.  The company is young and vibrant, as we already knew from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shostakovich-Bolt/dp/B000NVL4MY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shostakovich - Bolt</a>.

Spartacus seems less heavy-handed than it did in Soviet days.  It does not carry the propaganda baggage one could choose to read (or ignore) at that time.  Other things one associates with this work remain as they have always been. The Aram Khachaturian music, in the main, still sounds mostly loud, uninteresting and banal, indeed, for me, awful. The Grigorovich choreography is also a mixed bag.  Quite emotive and free-flowing at times, yet also at times uninspired and clumsy: when unable to develop a choreographic paragraph from a phrase (steps), his only solution seems to be to repeat the steps which usually are quite ordinary. In other words, when inspiration falters, just do more of the same. These shortcomings have been present in this Bolshoi staple since the Grigorovich version was first produced.  To some, they could easily render Spartacus unwatchable (yet to many it is a wonderful, stirring piece!).  In this case, however, they are not so much overcome as  overwhelmed by the eloquence, power, and brilliance of Carlos Acosta's performance.

The 2 dvd set, a live performance at the Palais Garnier, Paris, on 22 January 2008, contains a series of interviews with dancers, Grigorovich, Ratmansky, et al., as well as an extended, illuminating conversation with Carlos Acosta.  The reproduction and sound are excellent.",1227052800,20,3007,5.571428571428571

8284987,4,B001BWQVVS,"That might as well be five as four stars from the viewpoint of this  novice in  ballet watching. True my first experience was some years ago (h-m-m-m...seems to have been 50 years ago)... with season tickets for Balanchine's NYC company as well as to Beverly Sills and another better than ordinary group of performers at the NYC opera............both at the then shiny new Lincoln Center. However, pursuing the job market after that led me to parts of the country in which such things were only to be found on television or discs. Without hesitation I bow to the experts with their positive and negative comments.  I am speaking only to the amateurs who simply like watching what is in front of them........or disliking it,  when it doesn't strike a chord...........in either case, ignoring what any student of the opera have to say about it. From that viewpoint, I assert that this is quite a watchable performance........despite lacking the rich accoutrements often encountered when watching a production.  There are more than enough examples of firework-laden dance moves to exciting musical accompaniments along with slower beautifully molded steps, slides and other maneuvers, as to keep most of us well satisfied before our  screens. No doubt there are other satisfactory versions ( a couple of which I own) but this one more than holds its own.  Oh, by the way, at least to this one aged  male, one of the two primary female co-leads is  about as beautiful looking a young woman as one would want to watch.......that and dancing skill as well....",1506038400,,1553,4.9423076923076925
8284988,5,B001BWQVVS,Just phenomenal.  The performances are spellbinding and the music! Love this ballet.,1425340800,,84,6.0
8284989,4,B001BWQVVS,"The classic and magnificent Grigorovich production, revived at the Palais Garnier with an interesting bonus disc included. Of course, the Bolshoi corps de ballet has no longer the radiation and perfection as in earlier times and the musical performance by the Lamoureux Orchestra does not reach the level of the Bolshoi Orchestra.
In the bonus disc, speaking about the Spartacus role and the macho stamina of her Cuban ballet partner, primaballerina Nina Kaptsova means: ""Nowadays, it's only rarely you see a real man onstage"". Here she sends us a homophobic message  la Vladimir Putin. This kind of propaganda makes one shudder. At the Bolshoi, Nina Kaptsova may have worked with more than one closet homosexual she had not noticed anything.",1383868800,4,742,5.183333333333334
8284990,5,B001BWQVVS,I recently saw a production of Spartacus done from the Bolshoi and had to own a similar video version. This one was as close as I could get and it is excellent.  A unique ballet where the males have the dominate roles. The dancing is unbelievable for the male and female stars.,1383264000,,277,4.326923076923077
8284991,5,B001BWQVVS,"If you are expecting a ballet with magnificent backdrops you are going to be sorely disappointed.  This simplistic work concentrates completely on the art of dance, beautifully choreographed by Grigorovich, with Carlos Acosta truly macho and totally magnificent in the role of Spartacus.  Not to be outdone, Alexander Volchkov as his arch enemy, Crassus, matches Acosta's every defining jump and smoking piroquette.  Overhaul a gorgeous Bolshoi Ballet !",1327881600,,453,5.632352941176471
8284992,5,B001BWQVVS,"The ultimate in men dancing! And that's what you need to be for this incredibly arduous lead role: a MAN (I read somewhere that it has them vomiting in the wings). I saw young Ivan Vasiliev as Spartacus - stunning. But Carlos is also superb, bringing something personal to the role.

Passionate dancing, an exciting and heartrending story, Khachaturian's divine music: a fabulous night in.",1316390400,,389,4.984615384615385
8284993,3,B001BWQVVS,"I have two Bolshoi versions with basically the same sets, choreography and costumes.  The crucial difference is the character of Spartacus.  I prefer the other version, with Irek Mukhamedov as the rebel leader.  I think he is a much better dancer--his turns are just faster, for example--and Mukhamedov is someone I wouldn't mind following into battle.

The Acosta version is a different situation.  To me, it seems that Acosta approaches each set of steps like an ice skater in one of those skating specatulars with Brian Boitano or Scott Hamilton.  There doesn't appear to be much continuity to Acosta's performance. Instead, he seems to be happy with executing his combinations while completely forgetting the Roman army that is lurking about.

Another thing.  The booklet in the Acosta version states:  ""From the moment he first appears on stage, presenting the highly charged image of a black man in chains, Acosta imbues the work with a depth and poignancy its creator could hardly have dreamt of, reinventing it for a new generation.""  Yeah, because the Russian people know nothing about slavery and oppression!  Especially during the Stalin era when ""Spartacus"" was created!",1301097600,6,1182,5.168421052631579
8284994,4,B001BWQVVS,"I'm afraid I must differ with the other eloquent reviewers.  I see a lot of ballets and, having just seen ""Spartacus"" with the Bolshoi in Washington, I must say the the 21-year old Alexei Vasiliev (I don't know if he's the son of Vladimir Vasiliev, but I suspect so) was the definitive ""Spartacus"".  His first-act entrance as a chained slave was heart-wrenching in its complete despair and his leaps made the entire audience gasp.  The rest of the cast was the same as this DVD and, though I'm quibbling with the lead, I definitely think this is a DVD to own.  The entire cast is spectacular and, I also must disagree about the Khatchaturian score.  I think it's wonderful in its portrayal of the action, though I agree the choreography isn't always up to it.  Overall, this is a wonderful buy and I can tell you that at the Kennedy Center, it rated 5 raucous encores, as well as spirited clapping between acts.  Everyone loved it, as they obviously do in Paris in the DVD.  So, I will continue to hope they do this again with Alexei Vasiliev, but this is the next best.",1268092800,2,1070,4.479381443298969
