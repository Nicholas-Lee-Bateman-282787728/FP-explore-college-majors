This video has allowed me to ease into it in my own time, and I've learned so much from it. Jolene has a very soothing voice, it is very easy to follow ( no guessing and backtracking), and beautiful setting.  I think it is safe to say it is a great workout for all yoga levels~",1164585600,2,392,3.9
8054258,5,B0007YT11S,"I love Jolene's Yo-Wei Video.  I've done yoga with an instructor, but find it difficult to fit going to a studio into my schedule.  Usually DVD's don't inspire me to work out at home, but this one is exceptional.  It is very soothing and non-threatening.  A beginner could be as excited about it as a someone more experienced.  Using the weights adds a new dimension to the yoga to which I am accustomed -- it would seem like a ""real"" workout if it weren't so much fun.  Congratulations, Jolene.  I look forward to future DVD's.",1164585600,2,528,4.494736842105263
8054259,5,B0007YT11S,"I'm not sure what possessed me to purchase this DVD as I normally do not like yoga, but I'm glad I did because I really enjoy this workout!  The set is pretty, with a water fountain, potted plants and flickering candles in the background.  The music seems appropriate and keeps things flowing at a pretty good pace - I think maybe this would be considered power yoga (but I don't know enough about yoga to say for sure).  Instruction is done in voiceover, a format I usually detest because instructors tend to drone on in monotones, but Jolene's personality  manages to shine through.  She uses yoga terms like downward dog and triangle, but there is no  ""woo woo"" factor here.  The entire workout takes about 35 minutes.  The cover says to use between one and three pound weights.  I use my 2 lb soft weighted balls from Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds; if you have Karen Voight's 3 lb green genie balls, those will work too.  I would consider this workout to be appropriate for beginners and intermediates (I have been doing low impact cardio & light toning regularly for several months and consider myself somewhere between those two levels).",1161993600,6,1151,4.681592039800995
