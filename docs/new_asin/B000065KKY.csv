A man, who knew he didn't have long in this world has decided to live life to the full and make movies rather than rot in a sanatorium. As jean Vigo put it perfectly... ""A sanatorium is a place where people pay to be humiliated...""

This movie is beautifully shot throughout and I can only imagine (not having the pleasure of seeing any of Jean Vigo's movies as yet) that it is shot as he might have shot a movie today. Great cast, great production and a wonderful score to back it up.",1510272000,2,588,4.297297297297297
7961045,5,B000065KKY,"Whether you're a Jean Vigo fan or have never heard of him until now, this film brings him, his beautiful wife, and his passion for filmmaking to life in a poingantly poetic drama that allows the viewer to realize the heartbreak of having a grand artistic vision while living in a body which fails him and in a post-war society which refuses to legitimize his work due to his deceased father's political activism. The environment is one that keeps Jean from working and making most of his visions reality. Its amazing to learn, after viewing this film and understanding the challenges he faced, that the little work Jean Vigo was able to finish is now venerated as a huge influence on later filmmaking. If you're more learned about Jean Vigo, already know his works and the influence he had, you'll be pleased to see that this film is a wonderful tribute to his genius. The locations, scenery and sets are beautiful. The actors perfectly suited their roles and did their work marvelously, but I found I was most impressed with the writing which both portrayed the story and captured the emotions brilliantly. I haven't written many reviews, but after this movie brought me to tears more than once and had me scrambling for paper and pen to note down some lines that particularly touched me, I just had to scribble down a few lines on this fabulous film.",1508112000,,1352,4.684873949579832

7961050,4,B000065KKY,"""Vigo: Passion for Life"" (for the short one that Vigo lived!) is a free retelling (by director Julien Temple) of the life of French filmmaker, Jean Vigo, who died so young that he was able to make only a small number of films, during the 1930s. The story of his life and of his love for Lydu, the woman of his life, in this biopic is recounted rather rhapsodically but quite beautifully and sensitively. Vigo was dogged by difficulties which his radical parentage and his own leftist convictions posed for a career in so public an art as cinema. Worse, though, was the life-threatening affliction that Vigo had to bear with frail health. He died at only 29, of septicemia.

James Frain takes the title role. This motion picture is one dating from relatively early in the British actor's career, a circumstance that favours the portrayal of the young man Vigo, for Frain, being ever elegantly sleek of build (but having dieted somewhat drastically, anyway, to play this role, in order to appear yet more ""beauteously skinny""), curly-headed, and (still at the time of this movie) smoothly fresh-faced of complexion, he naturally conveys alike the youth as well as the touch-and-go health that made Jean Vigo's life such a physical struggle as he lived out the ardours of devoting his cinematic career to difficult subjects (by standards both of then and now) and to such highly original treatments of anything that Vigo's movies are about.  (Although Frain's looks, even with the weight loss, only in a rather general way resemble those of the real-life Vigo, that is not a matter of great importance in so imaginative biopic as this one is.)

The film takes many risks with the moviegoer's capacity to follow the story, which does cohere, but not in any obvious way. The movie is, really, quite beautifully filmed and is a joy to the viewer's eyes.

There seems to be no North American DVD or Blu-Ray edition of this motion picture. A good U.K. edition, however, among the various disc (and some VHS) editions of it which have been released in, variously, English or French, is suitable for those who have equipment that can handle the European DVD's PAL standard, is Park Circus VFD-4-1889, presenting the film in English, without any subtitles or special features (beyond the inclusion of the film's trailer).

Recommended for the adventurously and romantically minded!",1413072000,,2370,4.9002493765586035

Just a beautiful story. Own a copy but I am no longer able to view as my player does not support the format ('new' computer and dvd)",1396828800,3,249,3.9019607843137254
7961052,5,B000065KKY,James Frain exceeds all expectations in this movie.  Bringing the story of Jean Vigo to life masterfully.  His portrayal of this passionate filmmaker is flawless.  The actress playing his wife is quite wonderful also.  I find it hard to believe this movie is not available in the US.,1037232000,2,283,4.833333333333333
