5657385,5,B00BNAE6LK,"We just love the Littlest Pet Shop animals with their doe-like eyes that melt your heart! Littlest Pet Shop: Sweetest Pets is the newest DVD starring these cuddly creatures from Shout Factory.

When Blythe's best friends Aunt opens a Sweet Store next door to the Littlest Pet Shop, it's like a dream come true for these fun creatures. They sneak over through their secret passageway and get their fill of sweet, and then some! As happens with toddlers on sugar, the pets go nuts and exhibit bizarre behavior.

I LOVED this episode because I am always trying to explain to my kids why they can't have too much sugar so this was a perfect example on their level in a very visual way they could understand.

I remember watching these types of shows as a kid and really believing it was all real. The graphics on this DVD are amazing and I can see how easily Paige gets lost in it. That sweet shop is a magical place to daydream about!

I actually enjoy watching this one with her because of the fun music and dry humor. I think the humor is somewhat over her head but it didn't stop her from enjoying every minute of Littlest Pet Shop: Sweetest Pets.",1370304000,3,1147,4.421800947867299

8571480,5,B00BNAE6LK,"I like 2 episodes on here, I've never seen ''Bakers and Fakers'' at the time of this review, so I can't say anything on that one yet.
The episodes that make or break this set to me are ""Topped with Buttercream"" and ""Sweet (Truck) Ride""
""Topped with Buttercream"" being the Break, as it introduces Buttercream, and I just don't like bunnies.
""Sweet (Truck) Ride"" introduces my personal favorite character, Sugar Sprinkles, and who doesn't just adore Sugar Sprinkles?

Like I said, I liked the other two fine. Overall I'd give this 5 stars for ""Sweet (Truck) Ride"" alone.",1444435200,,568,4.795918367346939
