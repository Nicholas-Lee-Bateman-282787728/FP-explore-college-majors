You can go over and over until you have a complete understanding (I plan on going over these dvds until I have learned all possibilities). The host is extremely knowledgable in the areas to study. With the computer use of the program, mastering the program and a excellent ability in the knowledge of audio is possible. I only have 2 1/2 hours to go then I will go over it agian and agian until I know longer need the learning assistant. Alot of useful knowledge from Jason Levine and Audition 1.5.",1298073600,,567,4.40952380952381
