6656978,1,B00NHY7NCE,"Would have loved it, but the third movie was a different region format and would not play on my BluRay so I immediately returned the set. Would love to have a set where all three disks worked in my U.S. equipment.",1418428800,4,213,4.219512195121951
6656979,4,B00NHY7NCE,"The first 2 movies were great  and were formatted region free.  The Third movie ""Saints and Soldiers the Void"" I could not watch because it is formatted for region B/2 and I Do not live in region B/2. Whoever is the idiot who put the region B/2 movie with the other the region free movies should not have done this.  It doesn't make sense to put a region specific movie grouped with region free movies, because unless the person buying this group lives in that specific region that person is buying 3 movies, but I essence only receiving 2.",1417392000,5,540,4.434343434343434
6656980,1,B00NHY7NCE,"As other reviewers have already stated this triple pack is not fully region free. Discs for both first and second films are region free, ""The Void"" disc is how ever region B and unplayable.",1416096000,2,189,4.588235294117647
6656981,1,B00NHY7NCE,Please note that these are for the UK and therefore WILL NOT play on an standard BluRay player!  I wish it had been labelled more clearly. Will be returning them.,1414627200,,162,4.4
6656982,2,B00NHY7NCE,"The first two discs in this 3 disc set are Region Free, however the last disc in the Region B.

When the package arrived, the case itself on the outside says Region B, so I was a little worried and opened it and checked, and the first two discs do say Region Free on them, however the last disc had no region code on it. I checked checked them in my player and the first two discs were playable, but I got the Not Playable notice for the 3rd disc.

Product being returned and I am purchasing the titles individually.",1414540800,,516,4.15
8678311,5,B00NHY7NCE,"Well told, three different, unrelated, war stories.  Gritty and seemingly very realistic.  Beware, this pack is non U.S. PAL format, requires an out of region player.",1521763200,,166,5.346153846153846
8678312,1,B00NHY7NCE,"Didn't see that the DVD was ""Non-US"" until after purchasing. Tried on 2 different DVD players and DVD drive in computer...none played it. Requested return and had to pay almost as much to ship it back as I did to purchase the set. It's been a month since I've returned the item and still no refund!",1504915200,,298,4.339285714285714
8678313,5,B00NHY7NCE,"Absolutely incredible movies.  Very moving.  Fortunately, I have a multi-region Blu-ray/DVD player and the discs, at time of purchase, are labeled on the Amazon site as European encoding.  I loved the price, as well.",1485734400,,216,5.294117647058823
8678314,1,B00NHY7NCE,It dosnt work in my region they should tell you what region it will play in its a gamble,1479772800,,88,3.6842105263157894
8678315,2,B00NHY7NCE,"the movies would not play in our machine, I am sending them back it was a waste of money. they are foreign made.",1446163200,,112,3.9130434782608696
8678316,3,B00NHY7NCE,"Look at it this way, you get two movies that will play on US BD players, one that will not. Use it as a coaster. At the current price (apx $14 USD) that means US $7 for each playable movie, which is currently well less than half the current price if you buy them individually. Sure, the fact these were marketed as ""Region Free"" was false and anyone requesting a full refund should receive one. But, knowing I will only get two playable movies for this price, and one coaster, I will still make the purchase.",1445299200,,508,4.302083333333333
8678317,1,B00NHY7NCE,"Like others, I wasted money on this because 'The Void' is somehow formatted in a way that won't play on either a high-end Oppo or a Ps3, both of which play PAL blurays and DVDs fine. The bluray box says region ABC Pal
 Add this to the fact that 'The Void' hasn't been released in the US on NTSC bluray (why not?) and I would give 101 Films /Koan/Go Films zero stars here if I could.
 Some of us have been loyal and bought all of your releases in this series on bluray, but you've lost a customer with this nonsense. I will check and make sure I am not buying anything from 101 Films /Koan/Go Films in the future.",1425254400,2,612,4.091666666666667

8678319,1,B00NHY7NCE,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas in Oct. 2014. I knew he would love it and on Christmas he opened them to watch. The first two he had already seen and so he was excited to watch the new released one. It wouldn't play and he is really careful with his dvds and, it had finger prints all over it. Cleaned with a really soft cloth to clean the fingerprints and it still wouldn't play. We put in all our dvds and computers in house and still wouldn't play. Too late to get returned because I bought in Oct. First thing I was unhappy with in all the things I bought with Amazon!!!",1421280000,,586,4.104347826086957
8678320,4,B00NHY7NCE,I enjoy parts I and III but did not care for part II at all.  Reviewers have written that part III is region B and it won't play on their Blu ray player.  This is true but you should realize that if you are really into films (specifically over the theme of the Second World War) you are simply going to have purchase a region free blu ray player.  There are so many great films over the Second World War I have seen that have never even released in the U. S. A.  Trust me and bite the bullet and purchase a region free blu ray player.,1420156800,4,534,3.9626168224299065
