2895159,1,B000T9MYDS,"In simple words, ""a little bit of truth mixed in with a bunch of lies"", a perfect way to cause some to believe in what is being said in its entirety. It is kinda sad that people will go to such lengths of coloring the mormons as an cult, but if you were to personally look into their faith, as I have, you will see that everything they do is about choice and no one in force or con'ed into doing things they do not want to. This faith has one of the most effective charity and disaster relief systems in the world to date. They work towards forming people into self-reliant persons, preaching faith in Jesus Christ, and love/kindness to all. Their main focus is on family and living eternally together.",1375056000,32,702,4.325757575757576
2895160,4,B000T9MYDS,"I used this video as a teaching tool for young people in my church.  From that standpoint it was well done and informative.  In some ways, it's a bit over the top because, truth be told, I think there are a significant number of Mormon's who are fuzzy on the theology and practice of their sect.  The facts presented are well researched and, in many cases, presented by former Morman's who have left their sect for evangelical Christianity.  It's a good video to be familiar with when that knock comes at the door with the two young, well dressed missionaries try to tell you there is little or no difference between their sect and biblical Christianity.",1374624000,6,654,4.612068965517241
2895161,1,B000T9MYDS,This is SO off-base and misleading--it is propaganda not documentary.  If you want factual information look elsewhere--I'd suggest an academic source.,1372377600,21,150,6.142857142857143
2895162,5,B000T9MYDS,"As a member of the Mormon church for 15 years, an adult convert, I witnessed and experienced all practices and rituals. From typical Sunday church, to preparation for becoming ""Temple worthy"" to finally becoming a ""card-carrying"" (yes, you really get a card to show to get in) Temple worthy Mormon.
I had access to areas of the Temple non-Mormons are forbidden. I participated in temple rituals which are held sacred by Mormons, but in essence, are kept as highly guarded secrets to the Non-Mormon population of the world. And for good reason; they bastardize Christianity, including God our Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit.

Mormons claim to be Christian, but only did so to become accepted as a mainstream Christian religion.

They claim to be Christ centered yet, their true focus of teachings is ""following the Prophet"" which refers to either the currently sitting prophet, or the Prophet Joseph Smith, founder of the church. These teachings are in the Mormon extension of the Bible, the Book of Mormon and other Mormon writings, and even in Mormon hymns. ""Follow the Prophet"" is a favorite Nursery and Primary Hymn taught to the children as early as infancy.

Sadly, Mormon children are brainwashed. Mormon families and authorities systematically steal away their right to think independently, to make choices. Mormon children are singing songs like Follow the Prophet and they don't even know what a Prophet is, who the Prophet is or who Joseph Smith is, or what Joseph Smith did. Brainwashing of children is an abomination, and makes a huge statement about a church that has to do such a thing to children.

The Mormon church is truly more of a huge conglomerate, amassing financial capitol beyond comprehension, in preparation for something. This was Joseph Smith's desire and mission, for which he became a criminal by lying and stealing from his devoted followers and committing treason while attempting to acquire such riches.

Smith's mission is now a success. In part by making it mandatory for each member to give 10% of all their income to the church in order to be temple worthy and enter the Celestial Kingdom.

These things though, do not even begin to tell the story. Life long devout Mormons who became Professors at Brigham Young University designed scientific studies to prove many of Joseph Smith's claims. Who more than these professors wanted the study findings to support truth in Joseph Smith?
However, the findings proved Joseph Smith a charlatan, a thief, a liar, a coward, a traitor, a plagiarist and more. The Mormon church is built on a foundation of deceit, crime and stolen intellectual property.

""The good thing about science is that it is true, whether you believe it or not."" -author unknown

Mormons see mormon related literature as black and white. If it's pro-mormon, it's good. If it challenges Mormonism, even from an unbiased, neutral stance, Mormons call it ""Anti-Mormon literature"" and discourage Mormons from reading it. Even scientifically proven fact by devout Mormons is considered anti-mormon literature.

Because of the Mormon church's promises, it appeals to men wanting earthly and eternal power. Behind a veil of a loving, kind, family centered religion, lies corruption of which the majority of its members are not even aware.

Something to consider:
Joseph Smith may very well have been the worst False Prophet on this earth. The current Mormon Prophet may very well be the worst False Prophet on this earth now.
If you believe in the Book of Revelation, consider the false prophet... the anti-christ and thirst for great political power...  Watch this video. Then do your own research. This church/cult should be criminalized, dismembered and funds seized for humanitarian service.",1371513600,2,3741,5.09640522875817

2895164,4,B000T9MYDS,"First two reviews appear to not appreciate anything that seems negative or anti-Mormon about the movie.  The footage looks archival, from the late 70s or early 80s and can be hard to find in present times because of SLC's contemporary PR campaign that hides their origins.  GREAT documentary!",1360800000,20,292,5.0625

2895170,5,B000T9MYDS,"As a review- I would have to give this documentary 5 stars. This is an extremely important issue dealing with a very sensitive topic. I believe the program showed the proper love and respect while addressing some of the many false teachings. I was raised in the (LDS) Mormon church. As hard as it is to believe the illustrations in the cartoon- it quickly reveals the LDS doctrine. To the best of my (extensive) knowledge of the LDS teachings- every point made in this program is accurate. I have personally received a temple recommend and have been in the Salt Lake Temple and seen the ""baptism for the dead"" but I did not take part. Once I read the Holy Bible and considered the countless false teachings of the LDS doctrine- I quit that religion!

What is truth? Who defines truth? The truth is- most LDS believers are unaware of the radical teachings of the early church. The doctrine has evolved- changed over the years, for many various reasons. God does not change! If you watched this documentary in search of the truth. I offer you this very simple test- prove anything in the Holy Bible wrong. Many have tried and failed- only to become believers themselves.

I am a Christian missionary in Africa and have studied many different religions. I have read the bible many times and every book in the bible is in perfect harmony with the others. It is a love letter from God to you and I- an instruction book for life. It reveals Gods nature to us and his love for us! God- the creator of everything is so holy and righteous he can't be in the presence of our sin. We have all sinned against God so he provided payment for that sin. As Jesus the Christ, he took the punishment of all those who would believe in Gods plan of salvation. Christ arose from the dead- defeating death- the consequence of sin.

It's tempting to think that- I'm a good person! Surely, if there is a God and heaven- God would let me in! Compared to others- you really are a good person. But we are not the standard- perfection is the standard and none of us are perfect. So how can one mans death on the cross pay for every sin of mankind? Jesus the Christ, was the ultimate sacrifice- As God himself his death was of infinite value- his life for mine- for yours- if you will believe. It's not a blind faith- scripture in the Holy Bible give us many verifiable proofs- not one false prophecy!

For those who really want to know truth- just ask a question and I will provide proof from scripture- chapter and verse. Blessings!",1409529600,8,2505,4.450980392156863

2895176,5,B000T9MYDS,"knowing a former bishop in the ""church"" all that was said was the same as he had told me and many others.  Any church that has secret anything is NOT Christian.  Jesus said spread the gospel which means good news.  I have met mormon missionaries who cannot quote scripture from the Bible and are not familiar with most of it but know the Book of Mormon like the back of their hand.  I personally do not trust a book whose writer looked though a hat to get ""divine inspiration"" to write it.  The mormon church is NOT Christian and they do NOT spread the gospel.  When you are taught that you can BECOME a god you are in blasphemy and I personally am not interested in having THAT sin on my list.  I have enough without saying a man will be a god equal to the one God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob.  Most everyday Mormons do not even know of  a myriad of the teachings they follow.

I know Mormonism quite well, having seriously studied it and am familiar with many members of the faith.  IMHO the LDS church teaches love, not hate!  They invite, not force.  They are a family and Christ centered church, and their members generally reflect this in their own lives.  They are a force for good in this crazy world!  This documentary paints them as crazy, secretive,- some kind of weird group.  The complete opposite of this is true!  One of the prominent contributors of this documentary is Ed Decker.  After reading doing a little research on this guy, it seems he's got quite an interesting past... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Decker",1441843200,10,808,5.186046511627907
8208223,5,B000T9MYDS,"Disturbing and somewhat slanted. I've treated cult survivors or escapees. I always do my homework before agreeing to treat a patient about whose culture/background I need some hard facts. We see 'mainstream Mormonism"" as potentially quite dangerous to cultists; mental health. Hell, I have the prof in my triple-encrypted ""high-security vault in the sky"" as well as my personal files. (Sorry, I never remember that product's name.) I'm not old enough to have lived through the late alcoholic Sen. Joseph McCarthy's personal ""Reign of Terror,"" but I have older friend (and my parent) who did, ""Have you no sense of decency, sir?"" (posed to the senator by counsel Robert Welch). I know that I accept many basic tenets of my Catholic faith ""on faith""  we can't find any factual evidence that Mary was ""the Immaculate Conception' (born without Original Sin) or ""the Blessed Virgin"" throughout her life. However, it makes sense to us to accept these miracles on faith; it's at least reasonable. Mormonism is insidious, full of radically changing Joseph Smith stories (changed by Joseph Smith), rife with child sexual abuse and Revolving Prophets. Seems that Christians and Jews both have maintained a far higher criteria for declaring someone a prophet. My sister wrote a paper for the Law Journal while was a law student about the abuse of the First Amendment's freedoms by ""regular"" and ""fundamentalist"" Mormons.",1439078400,,1409,5.152838427947598

It's exposes how Mormon religion do use the African-American people as neutral and not able to get into the celestial kingdom. And how only sealed couples go on to be gods of there own to rule other planets. In order to be Mormon you have to pay temper cent of your earnings towards tithing even though none of that percentage goes to the poor and all of it goes towards tax free Mormon businesses and to the elite leaders of the Mormon church to play their high salaries every year.,1436659200,4,658,4.529411764705882

8208227,1,B000T9MYDS,"This is one of the most horrendously WRONG mockumentaries I've ever stumbled across. Anytime I see Ed Decker's name on a product having anything to do with Mormonism, I know it's going to be a sham. Most of the time when one encounters errors in documentaries, one can chalk it up to stupid errors, sloppy research and incompetence. But Decker's malicious. Unscrupulous. He does it because he loves a lie, and especially if it hurts the Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter-day Saints, Catholics and other churches he doesn't much care for -- and there are many.

One of the modern talking points of anti-Mormons these days is that there is absolutely ZERO evidence for the Book of Mormon. It's said so often that even Latter-day Saints who should know better go to their teachers, professors and bishops and say, ""If it's true, why isn't there any evidence for the Book of Mormon?"" That's because they don't know how to effectively use the Internet, don't know the sources to check out or the authors who know the material. Is there proof it's true? No more so than there's proof that the Bible is true, but there certainly is compelling evidence that it's a historical document of Hebrew origin.

There are three heavens, or degrees, man can attain to in both LDS and ancient Christian eschatology, and this is bourn out by Paul in his epistle to the Corinthians (see I Cor. 15). There is no heaven and hell, and if you don't go to one, you go to the other -- and we believe that hell is remedial, and that there is no burning forever. But when this video presents a person who says (with a straight face) that Mormons believe that a man who isn't married to more than one wife cannot gain eternal life. Well, if that's so, one wonders why the rest of us who are monogamous even bother going to church. You may as well shut down the Church and send everyone home. And why should monogamous people even bother being sealed in the temple? According to our scripture, one need only be sealed to one person to gain the highest glory, and the producers of this film knows it!

If you don't want to be uninformed, rent this video. But if you don't want to be misinformed, don't bother. Visit Mormon Interpreter on the Internet, or FairLDS. And if you want evidence that the Book of Mormon is a true historical document, check out Daniel C. Peterson's lecture on the Evidences of the Book of Mormon: (http://youtube.com/?#/watch?v=YL-NXToiksQ) and The Witnesses (http://youtube.com/?#/watch?v=V38jsyMnyIs).
