2098589,4,B0002I834U,It was good  for a movie that wasn't a musical  like  most Annies generally done with music  the 1982 classic is better  but that movie wasn't bad for sequel to it  for poeple that want more action then music will give it a higher rating cause it  wasn't musical like the original 1982 one was,1429056000,,293,4.218181818181818

2098592,4,B0002I834U,"Loved the way the setting was done , and actually better than any other Annie movie I have seen. This is a good production . A four because it was one of those that you watch and  say ""Why didn't they ""? It was so close to could have been awesome. With some better directing and a bit more patience this would have topped all other productions of Annie.",1425513600,,353,4.115942028985507

2098596,4,B0002I834U,"My 3 year old is obsessed with Annie, so I thought I would get this so we could add some variety to our viewing. I think one of the reasons she likes the 1980s version is because of all of the songs and dancing. This movie lacks those elements and the characters do not have half of the same personality as the previous cast.
That said both of my children already love this movie. They walk around the house acting out various scenes. It has become a new favorite. Now the kids argue about which Annie to watch.

I did purchase my DVD used. The seller delivered product quickly and it was in great shape.",1390348800,,604,4.252173913043478
2098597,5,B0002I834U,Ordered a lot of DVD's for my little girl that travels around with her family a lot in their motor home.  She loves them.,1389830400,,121,4.041666666666667
2098598,3,B0002I834U,"While this movie won't live up to the first Annie, it's not bad. It's sad that all the actors changed, but then again it makes sense because Aileen would have been too old. I preferred the actors in the first movie but this one will do. Good for kids, cheesy for adults. Would have loved to see more of Warbucks parenting and how he adapted to that",1384300800,,348,4.208955223880597
2098599,5,B0002I834U,"Nice movie, delivered on time. My daughter says that Annie has Sandy (the dog).  Also Annie and her friend saved Molly.  LOL My daughter was helping me on this rate as I haven't watch the movie yet.",1375488000,,198,4.324324324324325
2098600,4,B0002I834U,I chose this rating because it wasn't the best movie but ya. I disliked how the kinda messed with the story a lot. I would recommend  this to Annie fans everywhere.,1365724800,,164,4.290322580645161
2098601,1,B0002I834U,"Good grief. I got ten minutes into this ludicrous film and had to turn it off. So take my review for what it's worth, since that's all I saw.

I won't even get into how unspeakably annoying Ashley Johnson is, because it probably has more to do with the role as it was written than the actress herself. This film was written like a bad fanfic from a 13-year-old. The opening scene has Annie cruising the streets of New York on a bicycle delivering papers. Why on earth would a billionaire's daughter have a paper route? I can see Warbucks wanting to imbue her with an idea of the value of hard work and earning money, but not with a job that leaves her alone on the streets of New York, vulnerable to anyone who might think of her as a good target for kidnapping/ransom. Were there no criminals in New York at this time?

Though touted as a sequel to the 80s film with Aileen Quinn (a movie that has its flaws, certainly, but an enjoyable flick nonetheless), this film does not even pretend to follow the events in the original. There is no Grace Farrell, and Miss Hannigan still presides over the Hudson St. Orphanage, where all Annie's friends still languish (unforgivable - I know the old version did not specify this, but we can assume that one of Annie's first acts of largesse would have been to use her wealth and influence to help her friends find families). It's also not a musical.

This film, from its earliest moments, feels exactly like what it was, a cheap, rushed, made-for-television-and-easy-to-please-kids piece of drivel. Don't waste your time on it.",1354406400,,1568,4.572953736654804
2098602,5,B0002I834U,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So Im short about 19 0r so words for your review.,1353888000,,89,3.5
2098603,1,B0002I834U,"My daughter and nieces LOVE Annie! we would watch as a family many times for sleepover entertainment. Then I saw a copy of this at a supermarket. My daughter got very excited. we have the Disney version (not as good, but ok) and have gone to productions of the musical play. so we were aware of different adaptations of the story.
It was horrible! it is not a musical (she does sing the song at the end but it only helps put out the misery) I don't know what the run-time is but it seemed to go on and on with out a main plot. when you figure out what the plot is, it is very silly. It really ruined Annie for us. We never watched again and I cringe when I see it in stores.
Its good not to know what happened after the main story, Just think that they lived happily ever after. Or even later Annie grows up and inherits the Warbucks fortune and becomes a tyrent only to be reminded of her good side by a little orpahn boy that touches her tender side with the same innocent charm that she once had. (lol) That I would watch.",1353628800,2,1025,4.079207920792079
2098604,3,B0002I834U,Movie not what I expected ~ Well Pleased With selling merchant ~ Seller perfomance wsd great ~ A-1 !!!!!,1268870400,,104,4.526315789473684
2098605,1,B0002I834U,"My 4 year-old loves Annie. This was he worst!  I recognized some of the actors but have no idea why they accepted such roles.  If you want to be annoyed for a tad, I highly reccomend this flick.  Annie - A Royal Adventure is a royal bomb!",1233964800,,238,4.0212765957446805
2098606,1,B0002I834U,"This movie is supposed to be a sequel to Annie.  I thought it was pitiful.  The girl who plays Annie sounds like she was supposed to have a cold.  The movie is rushed.  There is only one song.  The timing of that song is terrible.  Warbucks gets knighted in the king of England's court.  It seems as jsut a normal occasion, and there seems to be only about twenty people there!  Once he gets knighted, Annie just randomly breask out into ""Tomorrow, tomorrow!""  That song is supposed to come in dramatic moments!  Not random boring ones.  This movie was terrible overall.",1193702400,2,570,4.544554455445544
2098607,3,B0002I834U,"The sequel of Annie(1982) the motion picture based upon the long-running Broadway musical of the same title during late 70s became more like TV soap opera and has less element of musical the first of the Annie movie had. Yet the drama otherwise failed second attempt was saved by the new character Dr. Eon and Annie's little friend who was left behind Ms. Hanningan's house. Molly is cute and almost steals the show. And I am glad Camille Belle who played the part of Molly quite well has grown up well to play the lead part of WHEN A STRANGER CALL in 2006.

Verdict: Enjoyable but lack action like the predesessor.
Rating: 75 out of 100. Mixed bag but I like the character of Dr. Eon and Molly.
Recommended for: Camille Belle fans and Annie fans.",1190851200,,747,4.492647058823529
