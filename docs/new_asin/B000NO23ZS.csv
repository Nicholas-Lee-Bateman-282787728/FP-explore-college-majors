2772515,5,B000NO23ZS,Overall this was a classic set released by MLB one I can't criticize them much on.  Wonderful hearing Harry Carey doing a game on this.  As well as the 1984 game of the week Cardinals game which was the best game on the set.  The only thing I wish was they included the 1998 Wild Card playoff game with San Francisco.,1210982400,,317,4.163934426229508
2772516,4,B000NO23ZS,"I have almost all of the A&E/MLB DVD sets.  At best, they are exceptional.  At worst, they're very good.  This one is very good.  While calling Derrek Lee a Cubs legend is a reach, the game featuring him is enjoyable.  Rick Sutcliffe's game isn't worth watching more than once if you're not a Cubs fan.  Plus in that game, some of ABC's graphics aren't in there.  Also a correction from one previous review: Reggie Jackson is in the booth, not Tom Seaver.  Sammy Sosa's game is missing one at-bat.  Another thing, if you're not a Cubs fan (I'm not) you might find Chip Caray and Steve Stone's constant references to the Cubs as ""we"" and ""us"" really annoying.

That's not to say this isn't a good purchase, it is.  ""The Sandberg Game"" is here, and coming from someone who hadn't seen it until getting this set it's one heck of a game.  Two pieces of history are included, Greg Maddux's 300th career victory (as a nice touch, they added Maddux's postgame interview with Steve Lyons to the end of the DVD) and Kerry Wood's record-tying 20 strikeout performance.  Bottom line, it's a recommended purchase for baseball fans.",1201996800,7,1119,4.619289340101523
2772517,5,B000NO23ZS,"This set is absolutely amazing.  The Ryne Sandberg and Andre Dawson discs are worth the price of the set alone.  To also get Kerry Wood's 20 Strikeout game and to be able to see Mark Grace play in three of these games is just icing on the cake.  All of these games are incredible and some I even remember watching as they happened.  I do wish that there were more games announced by Harry Caray on the set.  I grew up as an Air Force brat and my family's connection to our home state of Illinois was Harry Caray and WGN's broadcasts of Cubs games.  Maybe they can release a second set in the future.  If so, I'd also like to see if they can find some older games as well, like something from the 1969 season.  I'd really love to see a whole game featuring Ernie Banks, Ron Santo, and Billy Williams.  All in all, a good representation of some of the best Cub moments from my lifetime.",1201046400,2,884,4.183431952662722
2772518,5,B000NO23ZS,Now you can see the Cubbies win over and over and over! Forget the 100-year curse! Here you can relive all the best highlights sure to bring joy to any true-blue Cub fan! Recommended to any baseball fan (except maybe White Sox fans). Holy Cow! Cubs win! Cubs win!,1194307200,,263,4.387755102040816
2772519,4,B000NO23ZS,"If you're a die-hard Chicago Cubs fan, you are required to own this DVD set. Sadly, it's sorely lacking on game footage of legends like Ernie Banks, Ron Santo and Billy Williams, and the bonus features come up a little short, but the complete broadcast games featuring the 1989 and '84 playoffs (the good games -- the wins) is great stuff. Plus, Steve Bartman is nowhere to be found in the entire set, although the 1998 one-game playoff win over the Giants would have been a nice addition.",1186358400,,489,4.568181818181818
2772520,4,B000NO23ZS,"Overall, I reccomend this set.  It's really a must for diehard Cub fans like myself.  Some of the bonuses are pretty cool.  However, I wish the powers that be would have made this set more about about the team's achievements than the player's.  For at least 5 of the DVD's, the game in question happened to share both distinctions.  And I would say we'd want 1984's 'Sandberg game' and 98's Wood 20-strikeout game even if those teams didn't make the postseason.  However - while Derrek Lee's 2005 season was terrific, I would think most fans would agree with me that we have little interest in seeing a random game from a mediocre season (when he happened go get 5 hits) again.  There are plenty more games that meant more in terms of the team achievements and their post-season aspirations (such as one in September of '89 - a division winnning season- they were down 9 runs to the Astros, and won it 10-9.  Where's the DVD of that game?  Or how about game 163 in '98-giving them the wild card?  Both of those games mean a lot more than the Lee game - or the '87 Dawson game (which, despite what Dawson accomplished, was for a LAST PLACE team.)

I hope me and others can write the powers that be to follow this set up with something more about team accomplishment.",1183507200,7,1265,4.432900432900433
2772521,5,B000NO23ZS,This is a wonderful set of DVD for all Cubs Fans.  We have enjoyed watching this and will continue to enjoy it from time to time.  Great to add to a collection of baseball.,1182902400,2,172,4.029411764705882
2772522,5,B000NO23ZS,"The Sandberg game was the best baseball game I ever saw. Tonight I saw it again for the first time in almost 23 years. I cannot think of a better sports DVD to buy, rent, or watch. The other games are just frosting on the cake....",1181520000,6,230,4.021739130434782
2772523,4,B000NO23ZS,"Well here's the good: Video quality is good, all things considered. Loved Game 1 of 84 NLCS. If you are you are a true Cub fan, you will enjoy this set.

Minor nitpicks: No pre-game video. It goes right to the first pitch. Very little post-game recap. No mention of who the announcers are. I was at the 84 game and didn't realize it was Don Drysdale and Earl Weaver and Tom Seaver. It's great they only showed the games the Cubs won, but I would have enjoyed even the epic games I attended (23-22 Phillies win in '79) And I would have LOVED more Haray Caray games. The only one was the 87 Dawson game. But still a great set. Always a pleasure to hear Steve Stone too, one of the most under-appreciated analysts.",1180742400,19,711,4.266666666666667
8179520,5,B000NO23ZS,Exactly as advertised.,1454112000,,22,6.666666666666667
8179521,5,B000NO23ZS,Great way to see the past!,1452729600,,26,3.5
8179522,5,B000NO23ZS,"As a die hard Chicago Cub fan for many years while growing up on the north side of Chicago, nothing thrilled me more than when the Chicago Cubs earned the right to play the San Diego Padres in the 1984 World Series playoffs. Finally! The Cubs have arrived. or did they???
While this great book of Chicago Cub memorabilia shares a wealth of knowledge, Rick Sutcliffe stands out in my mind as a great pitcher to have on the Cub roster at that time. And why not? He started the first game, gave up two hits, allowed no runs, even hit a home run which was unusual for a pitcher at that time, and won the game. And I can't forget that he earned some impressive awards during his career: Cy Young (1984); 3x All-Star participate; Roberto Clemente Award in 1987; Rookie of the year (1979); and more. Wow! Now that's a good resume for a major league pitcher.
Even though the Cubs didn't make it to the World Series in 1984, ""Chicago Cubs LegendsGreat Games Collections Edition"" gives baseball fanatics of all ages some memorable and enjoyable moments to hold on to about Cub history, along with some bright hopes for a better future. Go Cubs Go!!! I like this book, give it five stars, and I'm Marvin P. Ferguson, author of BOYS ON THE GOLD COAST.",1405382400,,1239,4.43859649122807
8179523,3,B000NO23ZS,"WGN is extremely stingy about its programing, so that limits the possibilities of notable Cubs games on DVD.

If it were up to me I would've included:
9-2-69 - Complete game for Fergie, height of the season, all the legendary Cubs here.
9-2-72 - Milt Pappas' no-hitter.
5-17-79 - So they lost, but 45 RUNS!!!
10-2-82 - Last win of a bad season, 73-89 overall but 33-24 after July.  Plus, they beat the champ Cardinals!
6-23-84 - Obviously.
7-11-87 - 2nd of 2 straight SHO for Steve Trout.
8-1-87 - Another essential.
8-8-88 - So it was incomplete, but come on, it's the first night game!!
9-24-89 - Last home game of the season, Cubs parade around the field after winning.
4-13-91 - Bieleki pitches 8 innings allowing 0 runs and bats in 4 runs.

I wouldn't have looked any time later than 1998.  There's nothing loveable about them since then.",1382054400,,843,4.562913907284768
8179524,5,B000NO23ZS,"My husband got this as a gift and likes the selection of games.  It's now missing the perfect game thrown right after it's release, but its a great set of good cubs games.  It's a must for any die hard cubs fan that likes watching great games over and over.",1277683200,,257,4.12
8179525,3,B000NO23ZS,"This box set should have had the phillies vs cubs of 1979 game.  The sandburg game is worth it, but the others are not.
But the real reason I bought it was for the Kerry Wood 20 game strikeout.
I think it was the best pitching performance of all times.
His curve ball was sick.
Too bad they didn't have the espn highlight recap at the end of the game.",1275523200,,351,4.014285714285714
8179526,2,B000NO23ZS,"I was very interested in this DVD until I discovered, much to my dismay, that there were no games from the '69 team - nor '45! No wonder the GREAT Ron Santo has been kept out of the HOF! These young pup sportswriters never SAW him play! We need a decent DVD with the earlier years... with Billy Williams, Ron Santo and Randy Hundley, Fergie Jenkins and Jim Hickman, Gabby Hartnett's ""Homer in the Gloamin'"" and Grover Alexander, Jimmy Foxx and Rogers Hornsby, and never, never forget ""Kessinger to Beckert to Banks!!! Kenny Holtzman's no-hitter? Or Milt Pappas' no-hitter? Ernie's 500 HR? There is soooo much missing here!",1240531200,3,622,4.768518518518518
8179527,5,B000NO23ZS,This is a must have for any Cubs fan. In fact if you are baseball fan this set is worth adding to the collection. The June 1984 is my personal favorite. I can still remember seeing that game live on NBC. I love putting this game in on a frigid winter night and reliving the greatness of that summer afternoon. Also Kerry Wood's 20 strike games is something to behold. The balance of the set is great too. Worth the purchase.,1236124800,,424,4.246913580246914
8179528,5,B000NO23ZS,"My husband LOVED this gift and has already watched several of the games with his buddies.  The cheers from the Man Cave seem to reflect it was a good buy.  When I asked him what he would rate the DVD set on a scale from one to five he said, ""Six, and I would have given it a seven had it had their World Series.""",1232496000,,312,3.7846153846153845
8179529,4,B000NO23ZS,"Fun games all.  Wonderful to see some of the obscure old players, and old broadcast teams (Costas doing the June 23, 1984 ""Sandberg game"" was a hoot).  Must have for true Cub fans.  Cardinals or Astros fans should probbly steer clear for all of our good.",1224979200,,254,4.478260869565218
