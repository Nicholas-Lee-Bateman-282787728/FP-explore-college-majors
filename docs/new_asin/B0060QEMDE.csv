8490629,5,B0060QEMDE,"In ""That Show with Joan Rivers-Volume 2"" fans get six more classic episodes of the legend's late 1960's daytime TV talk-show that ran on NBC stations and other stations via syndication.

 In this package guests include the beautiful Florence Henderson (a pre-""Brady Bunch"" legend in her own right), talk-show extraordinaire Dick Cavett and funny man Soupy Sales.

 ""That Show"" only lasted one season as half way through the year many stations decided to pit the successful chat fest against some popular soap operas in the afternoon like ""As the World Turns"" and as a result ""That Show"" tanked in the Nielsens.

 There are no bonuses, but the episodes have been cleaned and restored.

 The three volumes of ""That Show"" are available individually or in a remarkable 3 disc DVD set together that comes at a lower price.",1328140800,2,817,4.912408759124087
