8431996,1,B004JRLPH2,"How can any American write a review on any new movie, when it never comes out in Region 1. besides hopping a plane and going to Europe how and when will we be able to see one of these new war movies. We should hold back our movies until we start seeing some of the European productions, but then again we are way to greedy for that nonsense. Nineteen years for the ""Last Bullet"" from Australia really!!!!",1414281600,,404,4.259740259740259
8431997,4,B004JRLPH2,"This portrayal of the agonising moral choices facing those living under Hitler's regime in the 1930s and 1940s is superb.  An engaging story of an actor's decision to co-operate with the regime and take a film role he and his loved ones find repugnant, it draws the viewer deeper and deeper into the dark world of Nazism.  Nothing black and white here; cowardice, selfishness, kindness, hope, despair, regret in shades of grey.  Good viewing but don't expect an 'easy ride.'",1361059200,2,474,4.9
8431998,5,B004JRLPH2,"Despite changing some historical facts to ""fit the narrative"", this is a powerful and entertaining film.  The tragic story of Ferdinand Marian, the Austrian actor who Josef Goebbels coerced into playing Suss Oppenheimer, the lead role in Veit Harlan's notorious anti-Semitic epic, Jud Suss.  Marian- no anti-Semite himself -  accepts the role, but vows to his quarter Jewish wife that he will play the part so sympathetically, people will identify with the Jew.  He does such a good job, the film is a huge hit and becomes a tool that the Nazis used to assist them in perpetrating the initial deportations of the Jews from the Reich.  As film's director Veit Harlan's son Thomas is quoted as saying, ""It became an instrument of murder.""  Phenomenal, deep and moving performance by Tobias Moretti as Marian (a fellow Austrian) and by Moritz Bleibtreu as the charming and evil Goebbels.  Great supporting actors as well.  Again, not completely historically accurate, but close enough.  Riveting entertainment.",1359244800,,1007,5.166666666666667
