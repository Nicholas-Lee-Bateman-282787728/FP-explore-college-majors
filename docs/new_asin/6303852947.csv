719687,5,6303852947,"Somehow I don't remember hearing anything about ""The Last Best Year"" when it was released to theatres ten years ago.  It must not have gotten as much attention as it deserved, because it certainly is a well-made film.  If you enjoy Bernadette Peters and/or Mary Tyler Moore, you will certainly want to see this movie.  Normally I think of Ms. Peters in comedic roles; she certainly carries off the lead role in a convincing, understated way.  Peters portrays Jane, a single career woman who has just ended a relationship with a married man--only to find out she has liver cancer and no support system.  MTM plays her therapist, who helps her come to grips with her past, her diagnosis and treatment, and her inability to open up to people.
This film has many unexpected elements and is solidly-written.  My husband and I enjoyed this movie immensely.  I cried so hard that I upset my daughter, who cried with me!  (She's only two!)  There's just a feeling of restoration that I feel after I cry that hard; maybe it's that when I see the sadness in the lives of other people (even if they are fictional characters) I am able to see that my own troubles aren't nearly as grave as they seem to be.
Put this on your must-see list--and stock up on tissues!  ""The Last Best Year"" is certainly worth seeing; it's bound to change your perspective about life and living, death and dying.",978739200,14,1378,4.587755102040816

7853988,5,6303852947,"This is a made-for-TV movie. It first aired in November of 1990, and I made a copy of it on my trusty VCR. Years later, after we'd moved down to Florida and bought a DVD/VCR recorder, I attempted to copy it to a DVD. The problem was, after all that time, it was in poor shape and all that remained was the audio.

The other day, for some odd reason, I thought of this movie and decided to see if it had finally made it to DVD. Hallelujah, it had! So I ordered it, and it arrived in today's mail.

I watched it tonight, and it was as good as I remembered, although I don't remember crying as much as I did this time around.

The Last Best Year is about Jane Murray, (Bernadette Peters) a woman who's very alone. She returns from a business trip to London feeling unwell, so she makes an appointment to see her doctor, who draws blood and runs some tests. As it turns out, she has metastatic cancer of the liver and is given about eight months to live. A plea to her married lover results in... nothing. Jerry is so terrified she might make demands on his time that he returns her key and walks out, not even giving her a chance to explain her terminal condition.

Her doctor recommends a psychologist, and after a somewhat rocky start, Jane agrees to see Wendy Haller. (Mary Tyler Moore)  When Wendy learns Jane has no intention of telling anyone about her condition, (does Jane consciously realize she's dying? At this point, she might still be in denial.) Wendy suggests it might be for her friends as much as for herself.

Amy, Jane's secretary, (this is 1990, remember) contacts the big boss of the travel company they works for, the man who saw something special in Jane and who gave her a chance to succeed. Because she's such a private person, Jane hadn't wanted to bother him with her problem, but he dictated a letter to the  head honcho in Chicago, stating that Jane was to take as much time off as she needed, and the company would do everything to accommodate her.(He's one of only a few men in Jane's life who are halfway decent. Peter, her subordinate, being one, and Amy's boyfriend being the other.)

Jane's favorite day is Christmas, and when she starts fading and it doesn't seem as if she'll make it the four weeks until December 25, Wendy, Amy, and Aunt Lizzie, Jane's only surviving relative, decide to give her Christmas early. Shortly afterward, Jane ""goes into the light,"" as Wendy urges her. The movie doesn't end on a sorrowful note, however. On the actual Christmas Day, all her friends turn up at her favorite spot and share memories of her.

1990 was a difficult year for my family. We lost my father and a beloved cousin, as well as numerous other family members. Watching this movie helped me get through that.

And today, almost twenty-seven years since the first time I watched it, it again brought me comfort.",1493942400,,2842,4.469111969111969

7853990,4,6303852947,"I already KNEW what a GREAT and beautiful movie this was when I ordered it. THAT was NEVER in question. So of course I STILL LOVE THE MOVIE itself. BUT my only disappointment was that the VHS tape version for some INEXPLICABLE reason was MISSING part of a scene and a VERY IMPORTANT SCENE TOO although ALL SCENES should be included in the SELLABLE versions, be they in VHS or DVD form, as the ONLY reason sometimes on TV we don'r get to SEE the ENTIRE movie is because they chop it to smithereens to make time for the COMMERCIALS! But HELLO??!! there ARE NO COMMERCIALS on TAPE! So WHY was that part a a scene MISSING!",1389052800,,618,4.2905982905982905
7853991,4,6303852947,"I just figured Peters was a light comedy actress, but WOW what a performance!  Just so you know, I'm a man who doesn't like chick flicks.  Nonetheless, buy a used VHS tape (like I did), and add this gem to your collection while you can.",1344297600,,236,4.222222222222222
7853992,5,6303852947,This movie is absolutely haunting.  I had seen it when it originally aired but recently got it on vhs and ended up watching it 2 nights in a row. The subtlety with which Bernadette Peters plays the role of the dying woman makes the characters impending death all the more heartrending.  Her vulnerability coupled with her dignity really make you care deeply about what is happening to her.  Mary Tyler-Moore also brings a necessary piece into this film with her sensitivity and compassion into her role as the caring therapist which coupled with Bernadette Peters portrayal complete the picture. They play off of each other brilliantly. Be forewarned that this movie is very sad but if you don't mind a lump in your throat and tears uncontrollably streaming down your face then this is the movie for you.,1074902400,5,804,4.811594202898551
7853993,5,6303852947,"This is a wonderful film.  It is so well acted by all, especially the two main characters. I get it from my local video shop time and time again and the video is wearing out.  I would love to have my own copy, but it's only available in Northern America.  Please, put it on DVD.  It is a film that will never date because of the topic.  Let it be enjoyed by all.",1068508800,4,362,3.904109589041096
