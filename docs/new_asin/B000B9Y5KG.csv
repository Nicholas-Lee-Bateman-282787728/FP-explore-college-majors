8083988,4,B000B9Y5KG,"Foamy rocks. He is so funny. It originated on a website called illwillpress. Foamy is a squirell bent on world domination and pretty much complaining about stuff. This is not a movie but a collection of short skits that the creater made and then posted on his site for everyone to watch and laugh over. The cast includes Foamy the squirell (of course) Pilz-e (the pill popping squirell) a british squrell (forgot his name) and Foamy's ""owner"" Germain (purple haired goth chick). Every now and then some stocker british guy will appear who wants to be with Germain and she pretty much tortures him and some gay blonde guy comes on every now and then too.  If your in to more adult themed comedy then give it a try. Go on over to the guys website (above) and look at his new stuff. Everything on his site is new and the stuff on the DVD is older so it's no longer on his site so if you love Foamy buying the DVD is really the only way to see the older stuff.",1140652800,6,956,4.252747252747253
