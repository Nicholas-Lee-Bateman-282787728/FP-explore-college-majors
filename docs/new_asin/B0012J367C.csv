Also, the introductions to each performance are missing, and this lapse amounts to butchery when it comes to Jon Voight's Dylan intro...which is cut entirely.",1269561600,7,287,4.877551020408164

8246182,3,B0012J367C,I recall watching this show when it was on PBS around 15 years ago. In this DVD you get only secondary recordings of the video and none of the commentary which actually made the overall show more interesting back in the day.  I would give it fewer stars if it wasn't Johnny Cash,1427155200,,278,4.245283018867925
8246183,4,B0012J367C,"I saw this tribute on television when it first aired. For the longest time I have been looking for a DVD of the tribute. This isn't exactly what I saw on tv - it's only the performances, none of the announcing or talking about Johnny, but it's good enough. And it's exactly what my father wanted (he and I watched the show together) - he didn't want all the talking. So he loves it. So much that he's bought more and gives them to friends.",1343952000,2,439,4.176470588235294
8246184,1,B0012J367C,"The video quality is among the worst I have ever seen.  It looked like it had been copied over and over again.  In addition, portions of the special had been deleted.

8246185,2,B0012J367C,"I was really excited to find this on DVD. That excitement ended when I viewed the disc. My VHS copy I made from the original TV airing is better quality.  Sure some of the songs are missing, but it views but better, and all the intros are included.",1283644800,3,248,4.166666666666667
