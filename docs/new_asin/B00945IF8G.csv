5257058,4,B00945IF8G,"First, this was a TV special for CBS that aired on May 7 1960 that sadly has a laugh track, and if you can get by that it is worth a watch. The show was shot on site at the old Revue Studios back lot(the same lot that the Wagon Train and The Virginian shows were film.)  Revue Studios would later turn into Universal Television which is still very active today. Phil and Jack were very close friends and frequent guests on each others shows. The Slowest Gun has its moments with an excellent supporting cast including Jack Elam, and Lee Van Cleef. If you like Silvers and Benny check it out.",1387756800,,591,4.276785714285714
5257059,4,B00945IF8G,"It was Phil Silvers comedy all the way, including cameo roles for most to the ""bad guys"" of the old westerns.  AND, Jack Benny topped it of with his typical tight-wad style.",1385424000,,173,4.40625
5257060,2,B00945IF8G,"Phil Silvers was a great comedian. He pulls a few laughs from this ridiculous story of a cowardly man who pretends to be a gun fighter. When Jack Benny shows up for a few minutes at the end, there are a few more laughs.
The humor is absurdist. mainly poking fun at Western televsion and movie cliches. One can see this as a much too long sketch on a variety show or more generously as a precursor to ""F Troop"" the quite hilarious Western series spoof that ran for a few years, a few years after this.
This is strictly for Phil Silvers and Jack Benny fans.",1376352000,4,555,4.196261682242991

5257063,5,B00945IF8G,What's not to like? A classic Phil Silvers comedy - and maybe it's corny. But still great fun to watch.,1357603200,,103,4.2
5257064,3,B00945IF8G,"Very much of its time, and amusing enough if you like these actors. Tough to see anyone liking it if it's their first time seeing them, though.",1463184000,,143,4.333333333333333
5257065,5,B00945IF8G,"Very funny, but a little ridiculous. I gave it five stars for the laughter.",1463097600,,75,4.428571428571429
5257066,2,B00945IF8G,Started watching it with high hopes.  Then came the laugh track in the bar scene.  All the giggling was so distracting I finally gave up. Never got past the first 15 min.,1462492800,,170,4.28125

5257073,4,B00945IF8G,"There were some hysterical scenes in this movie. Good old Phil Silvers with those glasses. It was fun, light, and zany fare. Phil Silvers is a character and I remember my parents enjoyed him so I thought I would give this movie a whirl. If you have never seen him you should check it out. He is not for everyone but I thought he was funny. There were good actors I recognized from other westerns in this movie which added to it.",1437177600,,428,4.2317073170731705

5257077,4,B00945IF8G,"This was a very funny classic Phil Silvers piece. The quality of the film isn't the best, especially in the beginning but it is still very watchable. If you enjoy classic 50's early 60's humor you will enjoy this!",1412380800,,213,4.487179487179487

5257080,5,B00945IF8G,If u like Sgt. Bilko then u will like this 1 hour western movie special. Odd for length and that it's a movie! Great cameos and also stars Jack Benny. Phil Silvers plays the new Sheriff in town who will never draw his gun and it frustrates every gunslinger in town! He constantly baffles them all and hilarity ensues. Great rare western comedy!,1405209600,,344,4.476190476190476
5257081,4,B00945IF8G,"Sometimes when you're not in the serious mood and just want a laugh, this movie is it. A Western that you don't have to take seriously, what more can you ask for?",1395014400,,162,4.09375
5257082,5,B00945IF8G,"I can't get enough of those old-time comedians. Along with Phil Silvers, Jack Benny puts in an appearance.  Lee Van Cleef may have got his start in this one, along with several other future western stars.  I love it when an humourous move is done with such seriousness.",1394236800,,269,4.583333333333333
5257083,5,B00945IF8G,"I saw this many years ago.  It is funny today.  I remember my father saying that Phil Silvers was perfect for the role.  Could you get other specials of his, like when he played a loan shark ""Louie the Louse?""",1393804800,,209,4.175
8535596,4,B00945IF8G,"A lot of young actors such as Lee Van Cleef, Jack Elam. etc. in a silly western. Some good laughs!",1529020800,,98,3.95

This is classic funny,  jack & will have nothing on phil silvers & jack benny",1506470400,,150,4.357142857142857
8535598,5,B00945IF8G,You could tell how over Phil Silvers was back then by his character got the first laugh track upon appearing in his special. Worth watching and Jack Benny was a riot!!,1482624000,,167,4.419354838709677

8535604,5,B00945IF8G,"Phil Silvers takes the classic Western to a new level with this gripping tale of suspense, drama, and finally redemption.  He wanders into a wasteland on a painted pony looking for a few more dollars only to find himself caught up in a cycle of the good, bad, and ugly.  By the end of the movie you find yourself wondering if he fired six bullets or only five. This is how the west was won.",1469404800,,390,4.1866666666666665
