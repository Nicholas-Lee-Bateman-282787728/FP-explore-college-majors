3803150,4,B001UNSZWQ,"A movie like BILLU BARBER belongs to a genre older than movies themselves - about the ""Little Man"" pushed around by everybody, who suddenly becomes important due to a possible misunderstanding which escalates out of control. The specifics this time are ""small-town barber without the funds to compete with his hotshot competitor"", ""major movie star shooting a movie nearby"", ""his wife claims Billu knows the movie star (Shahrukh Khan, playing a variant version of himself)"". It would be easy to imagine this film made in the Forties or Fifties starring Danny Kaye or Mickey Rooney, wringing every drop of pathos out of the Little Man's temporary rise and inevitable fall before the equally inevitable Happy Ending - fortunately, this film has Irrfan Khan (IN TREATMENT, A MIGHTY HEART, DARJEELING LIMITED), whose wry and proud performance of a man unwilling to trade on a possible friendship no matter how beaten down he is dries out the treacle and makes the film worth watching.

As is usual for Bollywood movies, there are a number of enjoyably elaborate song&dance numbers - mostly for the film Shahrukh Khan is shooting nearby. The movie divides itself between Billu's predicament and Shahrukh's dealing with the locals, all who want something from The Great Man - which he deals with graciously if a bit sardonically. By the end when the two strands converge during a speech Shahrukh delivers at Billu's children's school, the tearjerking feels earned for once thanks to the performances of the two leads.",1307059200,,1511,5.068273092369478
3803151,4,B001UNSZWQ,"Blu-ray version - The main characters are enjoyable, but most of the movie in general is just average.

The early part of the movie has a very contemporary/futuristic dance scene (seems out of place, but they explain it) with lots of young ladies in a variety of cool/skimpy outfits (average music).

The dance/music skit with Kareena Kapoor is GREAT (in the middle of the movie, it's the only scene that she is in).  And the last 15 minutes of the movie are enjoyable (good ending).

The blu-ray version is definitely an improvement over the DVD quality (but the DVD looks good in most places).  The other reviewer might be right that the overall PQ of this Blu-ray is not up to normal blu-ray specs (hard for me to be sure, I'm using a 2005 big-screen DLP TV).

The DVD is dual-layer with the same bonus material as the blu-ray (""making of"" & deleted scenes), same 16x9 anamorphic aspect ratio, but the Blu-ray has the DTS audio option and is sharper.",1287619200,2,953,4.576470588235294
3803152,5,B001UNSZWQ,"Billu Barber

In the film, Shahrukh Khan plays himself, bigger than himself, while showing some disdain for his over-the-top and sometimes ridiculous acting fans.  We get the impression that he wants to love and respect these fans if they would just give him a chance. Soon, he attracts a following that is reminiscent of the throngs of people in the movei Ghandi.

We are moved to deep sympathy for Billu and his family who are in ""bad condition"" living in a nice but rundown rural home nearly rupeeless. Thus Billu is ashamed to be seen in this bad condition by his now nearly inaccessible superstar friend Sahir Khan. This is a welcome departure from movies about Indians who live in incredible dwellings, but still struggle with life's issues.

There is a lot of subtle humor in this film that we did not catch the first time through.  One example is when Billu (Irrfan) is beset upon by his children to take them to see Sahir at a filming.  He turns to his wife Bindya (Lara Dutta) and says something like ""see what beautiful children we have"".  Then, without missing a beat, Bindya acts just like the children by nagging Billu to meet Sahir.

In another scene Bindya, at Billu's request, very reluctantly lies for Billu by telling visiting officials from the school that he is not home when he is actually.  Then, later at a wonderful must see waterfall location, where locals are bathing and washing clothes, she willingly tells absolute whoppers about how Billu and Sahir became friends.

Just being Sahir's friend is enough for a large crowd of villagers to hoist Billu up and sing ""Billu the Terrible"" a song written (in the movie) by a goofy, funny little guy that leads the song from his writing book.  Billu's sensible friend calls a halt to the melee and shouts that Billu is just a barber threatening to slap them if they don't stop.  There is a momentary pause, then, they go right back to singing Billu the Terrible while hoisting Billu up again.  Great song delivered with good humor.

Billu Barber is a heart warming story with good music, good dancing and excellent acting, especially, by Irrfan and Lara Dutta.  Khan is his usual self while carrying an amazing presence into Billu's home in the final scene.",1277942400,,2228,4.691516709511568
3803153,3,B001UNSZWQ,"'Billu' is a commentary on fame, brought to you by the most famous movie star in the world, Shahrukh Khan. The actor essentially plays himself--a mega-wattage celebrity--whose name is Sahir Khan. Sahir is supposedly the long-lost friend of a humble village barber named Billu, played by character actor par excellence Irrfan Khan. Billu's business is failing because a fancy new hair salon across the street has taken all his customers, who don't want to frequent his dilapidated shop, which he can't afford to fix up, and his young son and daughter are going to get kicked out of school if he doesn't come up with the tuition he's behind on paying. Sahir shoots some scenes for his upcoming movie in Billu's village, rumors spread that Billu knows Sahir, and suddenly Billu becomes a local celebrity, which he reluctantly accepts since his business picks up and his wife (played by Lara Dutta) can hold her head high again. The problem is he can't get past Sahir's security to meet him, and the villagers, including his family, start to doubt if even he knows the star--and they turn on him. Such is the tenuous nature of fame. There's an intentionally sharp contrast between Billu's simple, authentic world and Sahir's glitzy, artificial one, but the contrast is so sharp that it's jarring, and it's exacerbated by the disorienting item numbers.

Some critics of Bollywood (usually Western) mistakenly believe that item numbers (as suggestive dance scenes are called in Bollywood) are superfluous, when in fact they're integral to the movie, but not in the manner that Westerners are used to seeing in Broadway-style musicals. Like nearly all Bollywood musical numbers, item numbers exist not to advance the plot but to express emotion--in this case, bawdy desire. They're a sexy element in films that otherwise don't depict any sex. The lead dancer, called an ""item girl,"" usually doesn't appear in the film otherwise. (Thankfully, we're starting to see more ""item boys"" these days as well.) That way, the audience can indulge in a little fantasy without thinking less of the heroine (or hero) for being so overtly sexual. The problem with Billu is that the item numbers truly are superfluous because they're item numbers for another film--the film Sahir is making within the film. Therefore, they're confusing interruptions from the story. Which is too bad because at face value, they're examples of spectacular Bollywood item numbers at their best--and loaded with star power no less, with actresses Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra, Kareena Kapoor appearing as item girls.

I do not believe in writing spoilers in reviews, although this certainly is not a movie for those who expect big surprises.

Irfan Khan plays his role beautifully and I personally find him to be a more mature, versatile actor than most of his Bollywood peers. I only gave this film three stars because I tend to be very critical of Bollywood films and actors in general. But this film is a winner and very much enjoyable.

This goes far beyond your typical Bollywood masala to serve up a really touching story about dignity and friendship. Irrfan Khan is a class act and Shah Rukh Khan pokes fun at his screen persona, with some great in-jokes to keep Bollyphiles - and this viewer - very happy and impressed. A real must-see.",1244678400,13,474,4.523255813953488
3803159,4,B001UNSZWQ,"This is a movie about a poor village barber (Irrfan Khan) who had mentioned in passing once that he used to be a friend of the biggest Bollywood star (Shahrukh Khan playing a character close to himself). The star comes to the village to film for a movie. Everyone pushes the barber to meet his old friend but the barber keeps avoiding this. Is it because he's ashamed of his poverty or thinks a famous man won't remember him? Or did he ever know him and perhaps made it all up?
The movie's focus is on the barber so while SRK is woven throughout the movie he is very much secondary to the barbers story, and how 'ordinary people' react in various ways to celebrity.
Irrfan does a good job but his wife (Lara Dutta) didn't look that 'villagey' (more like a Bollywood lady dressed as a poor woman).
SRK plays the star appropriately well. He has charisma that is tangible whenever he is on screen. The best parts of the movie for me were the very showy song and dance numbers (done as scenes from the movie being shot). SRK partners with Priyanka Chopra, Kareena Kapoor and Deepika Padukone in separate big numbers.
If something slipped it from higher potential it was a slowness and repetitiveness at times with people trying to persuade the barber to contact his friend and him dodging that. Another biggie was a speech SRK gives at the end that went on and on to spin into greater absurdity (even for Bollywood).
However the movie's heart is in the right place. It is an entertainer, SRK I find always watchable even when he reaches for some excesses (driven by the script more this time) and the music and dances alone were enough to keep this movie.
Elsewhere on the Net it tends to average around 6-7 out of 10. For me its also a little above average for the dance and music.",1239926400,16,1778,4.440366972477064

Then I did not like billu who would not stand up for himself and speak for himself. Even his wife tried to get him to tell this famous star Khan that he was there in this little town. Billu said he would not remember him from childhood. But he did not have the GUTS to even tell him who he was, called him and did not have the GUTS TO SAY ""I AM KHAN'S FRIEND, BILLU.""  He fumbled at that so bad on the phone that they threatened him and said they would call the police on him if he called back again.

He was a 200% wimp and it made me very angry that he would not say anything; he kept lying to the village people and school that he could get Khan there, and then he just shut down completely. The school was going to kick out his kids if he did not get the star there, and still he said nothing. He did not even try again.

At the School program when Khan finally came to speak to everyone, he began to tell the story of his childhood and a friend he had that did so much for him, and he teared up and continue, then he said his name, Billu. And everybody's mouth fell wide-open. They were all in shock because the thought Billu lied about knowing him, and that he was his friend. He continued telling his story to them all, and they were stunned. When the progrfam ended, (but we did not see that part)...but obviously after he finished speaking to them, they all must have told him that Billu lived there.  He said he had looked for him but could not find him...he was here, in the small village Khan chose to do his next movie.

Billu also did not want to contact him because he was embarrased that he was so poor living in a shamble of a house, and his friend was so rich and famous. He was ashamed of his life and lifestyle and did not want his friend to see him this way.

The town's people, principal and school, all came; they took Khan to his friends house...and as he was talking to his kids and wife, and kids apoligizing for not believing their father, he looked up and saw his famous star friend Khan standing in his doorway.  It was amazing.

I can't stand people who are so weak that they can't speak up for themselves;he had so much strength around him, his wife, kids, friends, and yet he weakened more.
