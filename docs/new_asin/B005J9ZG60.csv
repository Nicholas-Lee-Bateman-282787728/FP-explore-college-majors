I'm going to save you A LOT of time and some money.

THIS MOVIE SUCKS!
It's like wannabe blade the vampire killer, meets harry potter, and night of the living dead, in THE WORST way.

The acting is retarded, the effects S-U-C-K
The sound when the blood is drawn is retarded, and the movie makes little sense,,,,long story short.
Guy has necklace that isn't his that can turn day into night. gives to neice. she has no idea what it is.
Pisses off sorcerer, because apparently its his
sends out army of horribly played zombies.
zombies after girl when guy with a sword comes and fights horribly and badly with zombies.
They run away, fight some more
blah blah blah
Sword guy destroys necklace,
somehow they are both immortal and cannot kill one another, so boy decides to cut and hurt old sorceror for all eternity.
everyone dies but the girls little sister, whom nobody has any freaking idea WHAT SHE DOES
I scream due to horrible movie and waste of my 15 bucks.

THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE?
~The white snake tongued servant who kills people has some kick a$$ makeup. yehp. that's it.",1323129600,8,1177,4.516431924882629
4712375,1,B005J9ZG60,"(1.) This writer really tried to cover their bases by tossing in a little bit of every horror icon in recent movie memory. The problem is that it's like a meal where you toss in so much stuff it loses it's identity. So we get a little bit of undead vampire-looking black cloaked swordsman that slices the zombies and piranha toothed Alien Predator cross thingy, and Halloween masked thingy, and a Potter wicked sorcerer.
(2.) We get the already been used cheap looking CGI special effects of creatures that turn into crows or dusty ashes only to reappear later. The customary corn field; the old house with spider webs that oddly looked exactly the same and in the same place after 10 years; never explained ripped sheets hanging from the ceiling that made no sense but added some cheap visual effect. The magical stone necklace (looked like prop jewelry) that seems to be the focus of the plot line but we barely see it until the very end when it gets stabbed and then not much happens.
(3.) The acting, script and dialogue consisted of 10 words or less (usually a lot less) followed by long pauses between lines while the viewer waits for the teleprompter to change to the next line. The acting was just as statue rigid as the dialogue. The only action to break things up was the soon tiresome black caped person twirling and swinging at what seemed like an endless stream of bit actors acting like zombies.",1321920000,,1409,4.595238095238095
4712376,1,B005J9ZG60,"Thirty minutes into this disaster I knew this was gonna suck. Brad Dourif's acting is just as intense as any other horror based role he has done but his dialogue was horrid. I felt embarrassed for Brad in this movie. As for the kid in the trenchcoat, his acting was laughably bad. Save your money and pick it up at the pawn shop which is where i am taking my copy to. As for the special effects , they were as atrocious as the acting. Special indeed.",1321660800,,450,4.183908045977011
4712377,3,B005J9ZG60,"SPOILER ALERT!
There Are Two Reasons To Watch Fading Of The Cries
1. Brad Dourif
2. The Make Up Effects Of The Creature Workshop
It is absolutely worth watching for the strange, doughy ballerina with a gaping maw and lolling, forked tongue.
It is a necessity to watch the acting of Brad Dourif.

The Writer/Director of this film, and self-professed young talent, Brian A. Metcalf truly has done a botched job of what potentially could have been an okay movie. He took a pinch from many classic horror films: 1/2 cup of ""Preditor"", A Tsp. of Neil Gaiman and a Whole dollop of ""The Crow""!",1321401600,5,586,4.580952380952381
4712378,2,B005J9ZG60,"""My best friend just died, you come out of nowhere, and those things..."" Fourteen years after the death of his wife and daughter Michael (Nichols) is forced to revisit the past. When his niece finds a necklace she is attacked and saved by a strange man named Jacob. Soon after, mysteries and secrets are revealed. This is a movie that is for hardcore fans of vampire/demon/zombie type movies. I say that because in order to be able to make it through you have to be fascinated by this type of genre. The acting is horrendous and so distracting that I found it very very difficult to make it through. This is too serious to be a comedy, but not enough to be taken seriously. I was not impressed by this at all, but again, for fans of this type of movie you may like this. Overall, this was almost impossible for me to make it through, but I have never really been all that into this type of movie. I give it a D.",1319500800,3,911,4.241379310344827

8475517,1,B005J9ZG60,"If I could of given it a half or quarter of a star I would of. Easily one of the worst movies of ALL time. Makes ""The Room"" look like a epic masterpiece. Nothing worked for this movie. Directing, horrible. Acting, unmotivated ,uncaring and off cue(amateurish). Special effects... lol,what special effects? Screenplay,horrific. A kindergarten child could put together a better script/story. I understand it was low budget but that's no excuse,there's plenty of excellent low budget films out there. Brad Dourif should be ashamed of himself for participating in this mess,and try to have this movie expunged from his filmography credits.",1418256000,,635,5.297029702970297
8475518,1,B005J9ZG60,"They must have used all their budget hiring Brad Dourif as the ""ne-craw-moncer"".  That's really how they pronounce necromancer!  I assumed it was pronounced phonetically and the hundred other movies that uses a ""ne-craw-moncer"" have it wrong (sarcasm).

This movie was an almost unbelievably bad crapfest.  You get horribly cheap looking zombies, running in an underground section that looks suspiciously like the Dwarven ruins in the first LoTR movie, and a vampire hunter wannabe (except there are no vampires) that always fights the plethora of zombies while holding his katana irritatingly underhanded.

The acting is putrid with the exception of Brad Dourif.  His playing of the ne-craw-moncer was the one acting highpoint of the film (not very high).  It's just a shame his dialogue is ridiculous, but he delivers it with style and flourish!!!!

There isn't much to recommend this movie.  Brad Dourif must have owed someone a favor to appear in this bullcrap.  Maybe pick it up in the $5 bin at Walmart as a goof.",1389484800,2,1019,5.047904191616767
8475519,3,B005J9ZG60,"Some good special effects and photography but otherwise... The story doesn't make much sense. A rebellious young woman defies her mother and goes out at night to the vacant home owned by her late uncle. Suddenly she's attacked by zombies and a young man wielding a sword appears and saves her. He's so good with the blade he can kill seven with one swipe!  From there, flashbacks of his story and the uncle's story intertwine to explain the core of the plot but not where all those zombies came from. There are so many the whole town must've died. The sight of hundreds of bodies littering meadows, streets, and the heroine's front lawn is impressive to say the least.  This seems to be two movies spliced into one. Brad Dourif is his usual menacing self though a little more restrained than usual. The title is mentioned twice but unfortunately I wasn't able to connect it to the story because the sound went down at that point.  The ending is also a disappointment. It was a treat to watch Jacob's swor skill as he bows his way through a cast of thousands. That was definitely impressive.",1388448000,,1090,4.579487179487179
8475520,5,B005J9ZG60,Wow is all I can say!  This movie is terrible. But thats why you need to watch it.  I got this for my friends and told them they have to watch it and the extra's on the dvd.  It will soon be a pop culture hit!,1380326400,,209,3.5
8475521,3,B005J9ZG60,"Ok, this isn't a great movie. But the effects were pretty good for a low budget flick. I understood the plot all the way through this movie too. It is a missmash of many other horror flicks too.  It has a brooding dead swordsman who is actually (spoiler) a protection spell. It has brad douriff as a evil over the top sorcerer, and a town that is killed and become dead shells attacking the living.  Ok, it's got a lot of stuff in here but It did make sense, the sorcerer wanted his amulet back so he could return from the dead, and he wreck his vengeance , which he already did actually by wiping out the town. he has three helpers straight out of hellraiser to help him and they are very effective as they are not  cgi effects. This is something that Hollywood should remember that cgi doesn't work as well as straight makeup on actualy people usually. And this movie got this. If you don't like low budget horror films then you shouldn't watch this one probably. I mean if the people who complain about this one can't handle it, then I hope they never watch a old horror film from the past! I mean the effects here would have been top notch in 1997, so just imagine them watching a movie from before that?.  Anyways , this is enjoyable in a over the top way and it doesn't have a happy ending. Which may have pissed people off , but I thought it was brave to end it that way.  So for a low budget film lover this was a worthwhile watch. But then I enjoyed 'attack of the crab monsters' from 1958. Like I said low budget does the best they can and that's ok usually.  It looks better in hd. which is the way I saw this on tv.",1377129600,,1627,4.14920634920635
8475522,1,B005J9ZG60,"Fading of the Cries (Brian A. Metcalf, 2011)

When it comes to horror movie lists, Fading of the Cries was the only one that almost approached the same uniformity on worst-of lists that plagued Hellraiser: Revelations. And Fading of the Cries is indeed that horrific, though in an entirely different way than Revelations is; everything about this movie is simply wrong, in ways that make no semblance of sense.

Fading of the Cries does in fact have a plot, though I'm unsure I can relay it to you in any coherent fashion (this is because the script cannot, and even the synopsis listed on IMDB only gives the barest bones of this mess: there's Jacob (Jordan Matthews in his screen debut). Jacob has a sword, and his main job seems to be fighting Matthias (Death Machine's Brad Dourif), a necromancer (side note: the consistent mispronunciation of the word ""necromancer"" in this movie is the funniest/most painful thing about it) who's after an amulet currently owned by Sarah (You've Got Mail's Hallee Hirsh), whose father, it seems, stole it from Matthias some years ago. Despite all this (which takes up roughly the first seven-eighths of the movie), it seems the actual main character of the thing was supposed to be Jill (7th Heaven's Mackenzie Rosman), Sarah's younger sister, who if nothing else is the movie's best-drawn (and funniest, though always unintentionally) character.

Which makes no sense until you actually sit through the thing, and please, for the love of peaches, if you value your sanity, I can only say one thing: don't. This is a movie that makes no sense not only in its execution but in its conception. The guy who wrote the score seems to have thought (or been told) that he was writing the soundtrack to a Hallmark Original Movie (an extra-inspirational one to boot). Metcalf , turning in his first feature, does his level best to make sure that every piece of miscasting to be found here is exploited to the very limits of its potential for confusion, which is also a fine description of the viewer's reaction to Brad Rushing (Shrieker)'s puzzling, sometimes ridiculous, choices with the cinematography.  In other words, the only reason I'm giving this movie half a star is that I finished watching it, for reasons that shall forever remain unknown to me. Please don't make the same mistake.

8475523,1,B005J9ZG60,1 of the 3 worst movies I have ever seen and I have seen alot of movies. Wish I had my money back and the 29 min I watched it hoping it would get better! Glad I was doing something else while watching it or it would have been a total waste of time I will never get back.,1356652800,,270,3.593220338983051
8475524,1,B005J9ZG60,"This movie should be legend!  Rarely have I had the pleasure to see such an awful film.  Clearly, the producers of this rancid garbage are either totally oblivious to reality or figured that the consumer is so stupid that they could realize SOME profit.  I've been desperately searching for pointless, rambling trash to waste time and money watching.  This movie delivered!  YOu can't imagine how long I've waited to see terrible actors who don't know how to say the word ""necromancer.""  But the producers of this film saw a need and filled it.  Kudos to them all for embarrasing the already slipping film industry.
In closing, everyone associated with this film should have their careers ended and be driven into hiding.",1327968000,,721,4.909090909090909
