8075474,4,B000A7BM0K,"First let me say that this is an official re-release of ""MGM CARTOON MAGIC Featuring 'Alias St. Nick'"" despite the strangely plane, drab, generic looking box. Who thought this box art would attract customers?

The film transfers look quite good with nice color. The tape only runs 35 minutes, but even in this age of DVD collecting it is still well worth getting.

1) ALIAS ST. NICK (1935) (Harmon-Ising) A cat disguises himself as Santa Clause to gain entry into a rodent household with hopes of eating the family.  Don't worry, his scheme is discovered & the toys become weapons of defense. NOT ON DVD OR LASERDISC (as of 2007) !

2) THE PUPS CHRISTMAS (1936) (Harmon-Ising) Two puppies enjoy christmas with their human family. While nicely animated, this one is a little lacking to hold interest for 8 minutes.  The older kids may get bored & I (a big animation fan) found myself drifting. NOT ON DVD OR LASERDISC (as of 2007) !

3) THE PEACHY COBBLER (1950) ( T e x  A v e r y )  Quite a contrast to the previous cartoon. This one starts out as a wholesome story of a poor sickly shoe cobbler who shares his bread-crumbs with some shivering birds. Then the TEX AVERY humor kicks in as the birds turn into goofy elves who go to work repairing shoes to help the ailing cobbler.  This just goes to show how Tex's zany humor can still have heart, it also shows what he could have done with ""Pups Christmas"".  While this was on the Total Tex Avery Laserdisc set, it is still not yet out on DVD (but may be this year).

4) PEACE ON EARTH (1939) (Hugh Harmon)  This Academy Award nominated cartoon is a very serious anti-war cartoon about the human race wiping itself out through constant war over insignificant things such as ""Vegetarians v.s. the Meat-eaters"".  Only the little critters survived the war (and this cartoon was made before World War II).  This excellent cartoon is not for the youngest ones, the dying man's hand sinking into the mud is very realistic.  But it is a must-see for everyone else, it will shake you up even almost 70 years after it was produced.  This message is just as relevant today!  This great cartoon is also on the ACADEMY AWARDS ANIMATION COLLECTION DVD sets as well as the Harmon-Ising Laserdisc set.
