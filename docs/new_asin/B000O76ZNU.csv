2792571,5,B000O76ZNU,"Porky's the Ultimate Collection contains all three Porky's films. It's about time fox released a Porky's collection. I think the original Porky's has been through what about three or four dvd editions already? With Porky's II only on dvd as a two for one with the original, and that's been out of print for a few years. So, finally with the Porky's the Ultimate Collection, Porky's Revenge makes its dvd debut. It's about time all three Porky's films were made available on dvd, and you can own them for a good price. Heck, even if you just enjoy the original Porky's you might as well pay a few more dollars to get all three of them.",1180656000,6,634,4.474137931034483
2792572,4,B000O76ZNU,"I was always hoping that 20th Century Fox would release the entire Porky's Trilogy on DVD some day. Well after re-release after re-release of the first film on DVD and the second film only available in a 2-pack with the first film, FOX finally did it. However I was disappointed with the special features. I am glad that a commentary by director (the late) Bob Clark was included, but I was also hoping that we would hear from some of the boys from Angel Beach. Getting their thoughts on being involved in one of the funniest film franchises in history would have been very exciting and funny at the same time. I also had hoped for a documentary with the actors, it would have been nice to see what they do and look like now while they talk about the films. But unfortunately all we got was a 15 minute mini-documentary from Bob Clark on his thoughts (and those were only on the first film in the trilogy). A second small documentary was included with the first disc with a couple of comedians giving their thoughts on the first movie (why we hear from them and not the actors beats the hell out of me).

Still for anyone who has ever grown up with these films or is just getting into them, coming across the entire trilogy on DVD for a good price is a great opportunity. If you are in your local Wal-Mart and you find it for $[...] I wouldn't pass it up (that is if you haven't bought it used on Amazon.com).",1180569600,27,1409,4.316981132075472
2792573,5,B000O76ZNU,"Well as I said with the Revenge Of The Nerds Collection, so do I say with Porky's.  I am glad that Fox Home Video FINALLY got ALL three Porky's movies out on DVD.  I loved watching all three and think that all of them are classics!  The first one is without a shadow of a doubt funny. The second one was somewhat cool....but the third one was a little bit different than the other two.  But, it was the only one that didn't get DVD recognition which to me is why it needed it and I am glad FOX did that.  Enjoy!!!",1180396800,17,513,3.9901960784313726

2792717,5,B000O76ZNU,"Porky's was the 1980s version of the American Pie franchise.  It was the high school, coming of age hi-jinks movie(s) of its time.  The movies are set in the 1950s and essentially involve a group of teenagers from the fictitious Angel Beach High in FL.  Everyone will remember it for the nudity, but the movies actually did have some substance to them, especially the first couple films which dealt with issues of racism, antisemitism and abuse.  The first movie was something that Bob Clark had been trying to get made for years, and it was only after he was somewhat established as a director that a studio allowed him to make it.  It was never a critical hit, but had a lot of popular success.

The first movie will always be iconic for the shower scene and Kim Catrall's ""Lassie"" scene both of which were hilarious.  The follow up to the shower scene in the Prinicpal's office was also great. The second and third movies, while not as good as the first, were okay follow ups with really the main issues with them being all the actors being way too old to be able to buy them as high school seniors.

Ultimately the movies are what they are.  They are definitely not for everyone, and are somewhat outdated now.  But they are classics in the teen comedy genre, and although they take on serious subject matter to an extent, the movies never take (nor the actors involved) ever seem to take themselves too seriously.  The only drawback to the set was the lack of special features.  They are mostly on the first disc, and include a film commentary and 15 min feature with Bob Clark explaining how he got the movie made and a short feature on the role of the movie as a coming of age film.  On the other two discs you mainly just get the trailers.  There were no interviews or commentary tracks on any of the movies with the cast or a more substantial behind the scenes featurette.  Had something like that been included the set would have been perfect, but otherwise it is great to have all three films together in a collection on DVD.",1451088000,2,2036,4.464864864864865

Heck, maybe even Brokeback Mountain wouldn't even exist without Porky's. See, there's this dang scene in the movie where all these guys are standing around nude with their dang tallywacker's hanging out. Male bonding at it's dang finest. Porky's was followed by the dang masterpiece Porky's II: The Next Day. Now, I must be getting more immature with age, because when I saw this dang sequel several years ago I didn't like it. Now I think it's pretty gosh dang hilarious! And there's this dang blonde broad with the nicest dang rack I've seen in the last dang twenty four hours. And again, there's a group of dang men prancing around with their dang tallywackers exposed. And don't even get me started on that dang preacher. He is so dang over the top that he could give Rev. Al Sharpton a run for his dang money. And Nancy Parsons again steals every dang scene she's in as the P.E. coach. She ain't much to look at, but she's a dang cool broad. Porky's Revenge was the last in this dang classy series. It's also my least favorite, but it's still worth a dang view or two.

I love the part where the guys start stripping naked and jumping into the pool expecting the girls to jump in naked with them. Little did they know that the girls were watching the guys swim naked. It was so hot to see the girls laughing at them as each naked guy cam out of the pool one by one. I know I am not gay, but it is so damn hot to see a group of girls in their bikinis looking at naked guys coming out of the pool. I love the humiliation when the girl with the camera is actually filming them one by one. I love the fact that the guys didn't get what they came for. The girls lied to them and that is so hot and sexy. Such mean girls, but it turns me on that they're mean girls.

2792819,5,B000O76ZNU,"Porky's is a classic that takes us back to a time (early 70s) when it was okay for an actress to take off her shirt in a movie, when it was normal for young boys & young girls to get & be excited about sex, a time before Jerry Falwell & the Moral Majority hijacked the Republican Party & began a cultural change from a free America to a God-fearing society powered by Fox News. Porky's is fun to watch, & will leave you laughing on the edge of your seat. This product comes with all three theatrical releases of Porky's: Porks's; Porky's II: The Next Day; & Porky's Revenge.",1275696000,,574,4.2272727272727275
2792820,5,B000O76ZNU,"I don't care what anybody says, Porky's is the best sex comedy ever.  Just One of the Guys, Private School, Spring Break, even up to the American Pie movies, all owe some kind of allegiance to Porky's.  The shower scene where Tommy pokes his tongue through the wall for the unlicensed hygiene inspection is the best shower scene in the history of cinema.  My cinema tastes are extremely varied, Goodfellas is my favorite movie, but Porky's is always great for a good laugh, from back to my childhood, and even into my adult years, it's still the best.  Grab this collection becasue it's the only way to get Porky's Revenge.",1273276800,,623,4.636363636363637

2792836,3,B000O76ZNU,The original movie Porky's is a classic and still screamingly funny after all these years.  The sequels are totally forgettable.  You may want to consider just getting the single DVD of the original instead of the collection.,1220400000,,225,5.054054054054054

2792843,1,B000O76ZNU,"It's simply a bare bones version that another reviewer specified. So if you order this, please check accordingly. As this may be a widespread issue.

Things of note:

The package and dvd disc case specify that this is the ""One Size Fits All Edition"". However, if your disc inside the case has a plain label that says ""Porky's"". Chances are that you've got a non-special disc.

Although the price I ordered it at was fine, ($11.99) I am disappointed to find that this problem is still running. As I was very interested in what extras were available.

Perhaps if this is corrected (and noted) in the future, then I may purchase again.

For the time being though, this is getting returned for a full refund.",1209427200,3,704,4.6
2792844,5,B000O76ZNU,To get the whole picture of Porky's you have to see all three films. It's kinda like watching Hannibal without first seeing Silence of the Lambs. Porky's lends a light-hearted slant to how sex in 1950's-1960's high school should have been. It played out the sexual fantasies without having to pay the consequences at the end. In a nutshell it was like Mad Magazines approach to Penthouse. Provided parents can check their biased morality at the door I would recommend Porky's to be seen by all teens.,1207353600,,500,4.758620689655173
2792845,2,B000O76ZNU,"What is it with movies that they only become popular if as little original as possible? The Porky's series have, for some reason, reached an enormous popularity, while they were more than just highly influenced by far superior productions made years before them. Lloyd Kaufman's SQUEEZE PLAY (1980) and WAITRESS (1982) both appeared before the first imitation in the Porky series (1982), and although they had reasonably successfull theatrical runs, they somehow didn't come to be as well known as the rip offs. And  more of Lloyd Kaufman's brilliance was made in 1983 (STUCK ON YOU and THE FIRST TURN-ON), but these much better titles also didn't reach the kind of audiences that later and even weaker Porky titles did.
If you like the Porky films I am sure you will absolutely love the films that inspired these series, and suggest you check them out as well! All are available on DVD. From Troma,of course!",1198281600,3,909,4.864516129032258
2792846,1,B000O76ZNU,"I don't get it. All I see are rave reviews about the special features on the ""One Size Fits All"" Special Edition of Porky's. Well, all these reviewers have been EXTREMELY lucky. Twice, I've exchanged the box set because the disc that is in the ""One Size Fits All"" edition is actually the previously released version of Porky's with only the theatrical trailer and NO other special features. Anywhere. The third version I got was from 20th Century Fox themselves, and it was STILL the wrong disc! I assume the special features are not some kind of bizarre easter egg thing I have to hunt for (which I did anyway, to no avail). So, before you shell out for the box set, I advise you make sure you are getting what you pay for. When the box quite clearly states all the wonderful special features, and the disc has only the trailer, something is wrong at 20th Century fox.",1198108800,10,869,4.471698113207547

We both split a gut. It has been a long time ago but it is still one of the funniest movies I have had the pleasure of sitting through.

2792848,5,B000O76ZNU,"Ok, I personally don't really like these movies. They're kind of funny but not my cup of tea. My husband on the other hand really and truly enjoys them. When he watches the movies he says every word in the film with the characters... rather annoying in my opinion. My husband flipped when I gave it to him! He wasn't even aware they were out in DVD let alone a set. Well worth the price!!!!!",1188604800,2,391,4.226666666666667

The original is an absolute CLASSIC and is incredibly hilarious! The scenes with Kim Cattrall are an added BONUS as she is 3 parts GORGEOUS and 1 part hilarious in the gym scene ... a real HOWL!
