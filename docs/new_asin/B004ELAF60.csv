8427179,3,B004ELAF60,"The film covers chronologically Chaplin's life, since his painful, difficult childhood until the day he dies on Christmas day 1977. The information is complete, illustrating it with images from his childhood, snippets from his films, commentary about the legal troubles he had with underage girls at the height of his career, as well as being refused entrance to the USA after the communist scare of the 1950's.
All of that is interesting, but the narrator has a voice, a cadence that I found to be annoying, as if he was reciting a script memorized ahead of time. There is no enthusiasm in the narration, to the point that, if the information had not been interesting, I would have turned off the film after 20 minutes. Good source of information about the Little Tramp, but very poorly executed.",1411430400,,797,4.824817518248175
