8176267,4,B000NA27CG,"I owned a copy of ""No Basta ser Charro"" but it wasn't a good restoration. The audio was poor. When I saw these 2 movies together I took the chance again. I hoped for a better restoration and I also wanted ""Tu y Las Nubes"". This company is great and I hope they make a Million$. The quality is as good as when I saw the movies in theaters. The audio couldn't be better. The 'Magic' is the way they made music videos of the songs. 10 songs, with their menu are availble to watch. I've never seen it done and 'love it'. What a wonderful idea. All movie musicals should be done this way. This is 5 star workmanship applied to 2 great Mexican movies.",1210809600,4,645,4.126984126984127
