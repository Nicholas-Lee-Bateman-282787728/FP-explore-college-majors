Some movies you watch because they are classics. Some movies you watch because they mean something to you in particular. Some movies you watch to be enlightened. But a huge number of movies you watch you watch for fun and nothing more or maybe to remember a time when things were different. Such is the case with BEAT STREET.

In 1984 when the movie came out hip hop music was on the rise as was hip hop dancing. The jerky movements, the spins, the flips, the musically influenced dance style was the rage. Hollywood, never one to let a fad go by untapped, made the choice to bring out several films involving the hip hop scene, almost always by a low budget studio. That year Cannon popped out BREAKIN and its sequel BREAKIN 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO. KRUSH GROOVE gave Shelia E. a chance to hit the movie screen. WILD STYLE featured the music of Fab Five Freddy and Grandmaster Flash.

BEAT STREET came out in 1984 and was one of the first to hit the screens. All of them seemed to play off of the same things, the music, the New York locale and the graffiti art. BEAT STREET takes on all of those themes. Kenny is a young DJ living in the Bronx with dreams of being a star one day. Along with his brother Lee who wants to be a professional hip hop dancer and his friends they hit the clubs and private parties held in abandoned buildings.

The possibility of success arrives in the form of Tracy (Rae Dawn Chong), a grad student who invites Lee to show off his moves for her classmates. With no pay and no chance to use it as a stepping stone, Kenny gets upset since Lee had told him Tracy promised him a chance at both. This leads to a parting of the ways until Tracy finds a way to make things right with Kenny. Later he gets that chance at stardom and an opportunity to show his skills at a major nightclub. He just has to show them what he can do.

In addition to this story we have that of Kennys friend Ramon, a gifted graffiti artists who also dreams of making it big. Ramon also has a young child with his girlfriend and hes trying his best to make things right with her and her family. He works as well as doing his art and finds himself in a battle of wills with another spray paint artist who keeps ruining his works. A face off is inevitable.

But story isn't the main reason for these movies. Much like the musicals of the past it was the song and dance portions of the films that made fans go to them. The movie offers plenty of that for hip hop fans who craved seeing that as often as possible. The film is filled with dance offs and party sequences that are filled with hip hop dancing. Not only that but songs are provided by some of the best performers on the scene at the time including Doug E. Fresh, Grandmaster Mel and the Furious Five and Africa Bambata among others.

The movie fits into the drama category because its about hope and dreams, some achieved and others that crash to the ground before they can even begin. Yes there is tragedy as well as joy in this film. In the end it is a movie that for those who grew up in the 80s when the music and dancing was just taking off will bring back fond memories. For those young enough to like the music they can now see what their parents were up to at the time. And for movie fans its another one to just sit and enjoy. Those interested in adding it to their collections will be the die-hard fans. All others will just have a bit of fun and move on.",1459814400,,3477,4.211711711711712

151389,4,079284565X,"Review of Blu-ray:

To me Beat Street is a classic 80s film that never gets the limelight or remembrance it deserves. Olive Films has chosen this 80s music drama for release on a lovely blu-ray. It was fantastic seeing this again. I remember watching it on VHS 20 years ago, and its been that long since I have seen it. It was a true treat of nostalgia and wonderment that only the 80s could bring forth. Olive Films has given a new worthy outlet to own this 80's classic for a new generation to discover the musical beat.

So many of these awesome 80s films that dealt with the HIP HOP or Break Dancing world has faded away. Thankfully there are companies like Olive Films to rescue them. Beat Street tells the story of Kenny who is a young, cool, hip-hop musician, who happens to live in a run down, rough neighborhood of New York in the Bronx. Now like most young people, he has dreams, wishes, and desires to be what he loves best, a part of the music world. He wants to be a DJ, and spread his love and passion for the art of music in nightclubs and beyond. He lives with his younger brother Lee, and his mother Cora. As you would guess, you have to enter the crush, the main female lead. The character of Tracy comes from a total different setting. Tracy is a composer and choreographer for the City College of New York. Even though both live differently, they become friends, and Tracy pushes Kenny to follow his dreams. Soon that friendship grows to include a romantic angle.

You are introduced to a young cast of dreamers and wishers, those who want to follow what they love best. From Tracy and Kennys love of music, to Kennys brother Lee, as you would guess, it being an 80s film, he is into break dancing, and is part of a group that wishes to be the best. Also the character and friend, Ramon, who is a graffiti artist that wants to spread his art all across the city.

This is a movie that has the mentality of young dreamers. An 80s film of Hip-Hop music, break dancing and the style of the city come to life. Kenny is played wonderfully by Guy Davis. Davis is shocking in that he only acted in 9 films/TV. But his real reality is, he is an American Blues musician. His passion for guitar and banjo is what he truly is all about. So seeing Guy Davis in this film and knowing that in real life he is musician, and followed his own dreams of becoming a well-known Blues Musician, is what makes this film shine. Interesting to note, Guy Davis is the son of two very important, and wonderful performers in cinema history, the amazing, beautiful, one of a kind Ruby Davis, and also the spectacular Ossie Davis. Two great parent actors.

This also stars one of my favorite performers in films both great and small. The beautiful, vibrant and amazing Rae Dawn Chong. She plays the character of Tracy. Chong has been an actress in many films that stand out, and are worthy to praise. No matter how great or small the part she does, her personality and craft of excellence stands out. Every moment on screen she owns. She creates her characters to be believed. To be forced upon you, to own you. Acting from her seems like its nothing but smooth undertaking. She is a flawless gem in performance. One of her greatest roles was in the masterpiece of cinema, The Color Purple (1985). She always is a treat to see and her part of Tracy is one of those treats.

This has a slew of real Hip-Hop musicians and a collective 80s induvial in the world of DJing and culture. The Hip-Hop Grandmaster Melle, Mel who is basically one of the pioneers of rap music. He is part of the original Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The one of a kind original DJ for the South Bronx New York, Afrika Bambaataa. The one and only DJ Jazzy Jay. The beatboxing master and pioneer of the art form Doug E. Fresh. Which might I add he is known as the Human Beat Box. The New York Breakers who originally was known as the Floormaster Crew. They were truly a gifted group of original wonders that took the 80s to stardom. They were on TV, quest performers and even toured. Part of many Televisions appearances and film appearances. They were, and are a pivotal part of the history and the start of HIP HOP culture. True pioneers. This film also has the original Rock Steady Crew. The one and only DJ Kool Herc a.k.a. Clive Campbell. He was the pioneer and the original DJ who helped start and create the start of HIP HOP culture. The amazing group The Treacherous Three. One of the great pioneering HIP HOP groups of all time.

Beat Street is that 80s brilliance that modern films cant understand, or touch on the brilliance of that era. Beat Street goes up there with such classics like 1983s Wild Style, 1985s Krush Groove, 1984s Breakin. These type of movies where landmark films of a growing culture of DJs, HIP HOP artists, dancers and graffiti artists.

Audio/Video:
The film has never looked any better. Its great seeing this film again, and now on a Blu-ray to enjoy.
Screen: 1.85:1 Aspect Ratio; COLOR
Languages: ENGLISH

Overall:
Olive Films has done a fantastic job in picking this forgotten 80s nostalgic gem of HIP HOP, dance and art. Its always great adventuring into these older films that bring the 80s back in all its glory. A fantastic Blu-ray to showcase that 80s generation to a whole new generation. The 80s was the best in music, dance, expression, and creation of originality, and Beat Street showcases that reality.

At that time I have the opportunity to go to the premier in Puerto Rico with mi oldest sister (RIP) since she took me and few of my oldest friends that we use to breakdance to a Salsa radio station (Z93) that they were giving away free ticket and we were able to get six free ticket and they day of the premier we realize that al the actors and the Rock Steady Crew plus the NYC Breakers came to Puerto Rico for the premier and the theater was packed to the max so it was a great experience for me and my friends and at the end of the movie they battle with some of the B-Boys from PR.

151539,5,079284565X,Very very satisfied. It felt good to go back to my childhood and watch this great movie. Thank you for this memory,1396915200,,114,4.2272727272727275
151540,3,079284565X,"There's a community center to save, and the TKO (Turbo, Kelly, Ozone) crew are the ones to do it, with some help from a young, leather-daddy Ice-T!

There isn't too much to say about this that someone wouldn't expect from a sequel to a movie about breakdancers. We made some estimates, and there is almost 50 minutes of dancing in a movie that is about 1:20 long. It's not all breakdancing, as there are a lot of choreographed numbers, and at least 2 sequences of a mob dancing down a street.

The actors turn in passable performances, given the level of the material, but no one is watching Breakin' 2 to listen to Ozone monologue. The dancing is energetic, the cast seems to be enjoying themselves, and overall, the movie provides exactly what you were expecting to see. A lot of neon colors, some fun dance sequences and the return of the TKO crew.",1395014400,,851,4.51948051948052

151584,5,079284565X,"If you grew up in the 80's then you already know what a classic this is. The 80's were defined by three movies based hip hop culture. Krush Groove, Beat Street & Purple Rain. A must buy for nostalgic fans everywhere.",1394409600,,216,4.2926829268292686
151585,5,079284565X,"Growing up in NYC and graduating in 1985 makes me biased when it comes to Beat Street which cannot be touched in regards of vintage hip hop culture. I attended Andrew Jackson High school and Todd Smith AKA LL Cool J was one of my classmates. Run from Run DMC also graduated from AJ. The legendary Jam Master J attended P.S.  147 with me and was 2 years ahead. That's just a fraction of the talent that I grew up with. Beat street came out when hip hop was just more of an art than the nonsense you hear today. The East Coast was quite different from the West coast and we took pride in the gold nameplates, Lee jeans and Adidas, Kangol hats etc. Beat Street for those who were not a part of that era is REAL. This story happened countless times in Brooklyn. Queens, The Bronx, and Uptown. This was years before East and West coast had idiotic beefs and people were killed. We were proud of being New Yorkers and that was our focus. Beat street is 100 percent authentic and we saw ourselves in that movie. Every character was someone with whom you could relate to. The best part of it all for me is that I went to countless concerts and basement jams seeing the likes of all the performers in Beat Street. Going to the Bronx with my crew all wearing our football jackets and going down a dungy basement filled with teenage boys and girls. Going to Harlem World seeing the pioneer Cool Herc making sure everything is in check. I can never get tired of watching this movie because I was there was not a better time or place to have gone to high school. As a healthy 46 year old I watch this movie and it takes me back to a time that was just.......better.",1393891200,12,1652,4.2444444444444445

151688,5,079284565X,"So many great movies came out in 1984, Ghostbusters, Gremlins, The Terminator, Revenge of the Nerds, just to name a few. But few spoke to inner city kids and the break-dancing and slowing growing hip-hop community like ""Beat Street"" did. ""Breakin"" had a few good scenes, but was soft and corny and let's not talk about the sequel. I was 10 and living in LA at the time, and I was dealing with my own problems, having just relocated from the Midwest. But as I watched I could escape into another world of pop-locking, spray paint, subways and beats that blew my mind. Remember this a time before the internet and we didn't have a VCR, so I would frantically search the TV guide for the next showing of this cult classic. I've seen this movie to many times to count and a few years back I added it to my collection. This movie really shows how hip hop started. Before hip hop became mainstream, it stared in abandoned buildings were MCs honed their skills in front of live audiences freestyling to music put together by disk jockeys or ""DJs."" In the beginning the DJs garnered more attention that the MC. He was the architect, the mastermind behind it all. Nowadays most attention is given to the MC, but back then the DJs ruled. It's about a group of guys who are all different but seem to come together for a common cause, hip hop. They're also just trying to survive in world that doesn't seem to understand them. It stars a young Rae Dawn Chong and Guy Davis and was produced by Harry Belafonte. It takes you on an emotional ride and for a lot of us who grew up in the 80s it taught us how to be ""fresh.""

151719,5,079284565X,"1984!!! I was born in November 28, 1984 when the beginning of the New School Hip-Hop era also known as Golden Age!
Few important things in hip hop in 1984 speaks to my ear was New Schoolers like Run-D.M.C, Whodini, The Fat Boys, L.L. Cool J, and the empire soundtrack music of DEF JAM were the moments where I was a baby growing up. But other than that, 3 movies saved me for the better: Breakin', Breakin' 2:Electric Boogaloo, and Beat Street!!!!! In 1989 when I was 4 years old, I was into late 80s music (New Jack Swing, Rakims, BDKs, Chuck Ds, Will Smiths, Rap Citys, and YO! MTV Raps, etc.) and watching these movies until when 'Pac and Biggie when gunned down 6 months apart (September 1996 & March 1997). I start bboying, popping and locking when I was 12 in '97. By the time 90s were finished,it was never be the same. AGAIN! First of all:

Breakin' (Breakdance): Excellent film when I first saw Ice-T rocking it before he switched up to Gangsta Rap.
TKO-Turbo, Kelly and Ozone were the realest crew can bust a move. I loved the last few parts when they were auditioned for the jazz show like the Street Jazz scene. This movie gives me a moment I first bboying. GREAT FLICK!

Breakin' 2:Electric Boogaloo (Breakdance 2): Magnificent flick where Kelly was originally going to Paris for the audition until Turbo fall down the stairs. Sad part, but I gotta go with the community center's grand opening ""Miracles"". Ice-T also appeared in the movie. I'm glad that the T.K.O. crew saved the day and the rest. Din Daa Daa by George Kranz is a excellent song, too!

Beat Street: The East Coast's response to Breakin' was more interesting and more excellence when the sounds of Afrika Bambaataa and Arthur Baker's music was blasting! Love the Roxy part, the Subway part, The Treacherous 3 and Doug E. Fresh's performance Xmas Rap were the bomb. Ramo, a true grafitti hero is the moment you gonna see for the rest of your life. Finale performance with Melle Mel rips the stage apart when the song Beat Street Breakdown gives it real raw performance after the passing of Ramo fighting with other grafittiest Spit. Love that movie!!! It was the baddest and illest movie i ever saw.

Music from these 3 movies are 100 real! Great songs, great music, and great memories of my life.
Where's the movie ""RAPPIN"" aka Breakdance 3 where Mario Van Peebles, Eriq LaSalle and others were rapping like real rappers? Love when The Force MD's were blowing up with the song ""Itchin' for the Scratch"". MGM could've done better, i guess. Love that collection because if you don't have time to buy a single DVD of these movies, I suggest you go buy this entire collection! Indeed.",1307923200,,2659,4.591578947368421

""Well alright, just look at you now

Nobody knows how you got it, but everyone says kid you got it, so now that I know that you got it, we can make it right.

You're one of the few, girl you got it, I feel it in you, girl you got it, I'm telling you now that you got it. We can make it right

I'm a fan of early rap and am interested in the music styles and performances in this movie, so I really enjoyed this.  However, in all fairness, the sub-plots add nothing to the movie - ie.  The obligatory rags vs. riches romance between the lead character and Rae Dawn Chong (who for some reason in this edition is now given star billing as opposed to her proper supporting role), and the graffiti artist with a heart of gold (+ a child out of wedlock, no job, and a girlfriend who's mother-in-law who can't stand him and is portrayed as cruel and intolerant, how 80's.

The highlight of the movie without question is the performance by Grand Master Melle Mel towards the end.  The club scenes at the Roxy (featuring an early appearance by DJ Jazzy Jeff in one instance) are also a high-point.  The dancing is of it's time, but I still found it interesting to watch.",1215129600,,1130,4.536945812807882

151828,5,079284565X,"Being a big fan of 80s music, electro, rap and hip hop from that era, this was a movie I had to see.  Initially, it was to put my extended soundtrack in play order, only I found out the 2 official record releases only cover about half of the songs.  In total, their are 39 tunes in the movie, 34 of which can be found on the soundtrack LPs, searching on the Internet or buying separate single LPs for various songs.  The bad thing about this classic ""breaking"" film is that the credits are terrible in respect to the musicians.  All it says is ""These artists contributed songs to the film"" and then shows their names.  No song titles or who did what.  I've never seen a movie do that before and it makes it a major pain to figure out who did the few mystery tunes, which play for a few seconds to several minutes, but have lyrics.  Even worse is trying to track down artists heard in the movie on the Internet and not finding anything by them, like Andy B. Bad (aka Andy Bonafede), Richard Sisco and Wanda Dee and Brenda K. Starr's ""Vicious Beat"" (which was clearly done for the film due to the lyrics).  Sure glad the IMDb (International Movie Database) site has a good sized message board on the movie, otherwise I wouldn't have figured out a lot of the tunes I was missing.

As for the movie itself, it is a masterpiece of early 80s era dance culture with awesome electro, rap, hip hop, reggae, house and dance music.  The story is involving, emotional and entertaining.  The break dancing is amazing.  I can't help but be highly impressed and astounded at the moves the kids (and adults, for some looked like young guys, but weren't) were able to pull off.  You watch and go ""Wow!"", ""OMG!"", ""How did he do that?"", etc.  The celebration for Ramo at the end is wonderful and brings tears to your eyes with all the energy it brings.  Would have loved to be in the huge audience at the time of film.  Must have been great.  Back in the 80s, I didn't like this style of movie, nor the music (except for electro), but I do now.  The rap of the 80s was musical, not garbage (though there were a few groups that were) and the hip hop was intensely danceable and positive in lyrics, compared to today.  I just never gave it a chance back then, same for heavy metal from that time, which I like now too (depending on the group, of course).  ""Beat Street"" is a must-see for anyone that loves 80s music and a good story.  You will not be disappointed.",1206057600,,2443,4.301969365426696

La Familia, Ballbuster, Zulu Nation ruled the streets back then.

So I guess I got the right to say the movie accurately portrays life in NYC in the 80's. Some guy here criticized the love songs. C'mon man. What, people back then in the projects didn't love anyone?, had a girlfriend, etc? I find the movie to be so real that I definitely want to move back to NYC.

I know New York isn't the same. The South Bronx is being renovated. The gangs are gone. All the bombers, Lee jeans creased down the middle and finely pressed and jackets, the pumas and adidas with the thick laces in checkerboard formation, the boricuas with their wild Carribean looks, its ALL gone.

I won't go into the story, but I see that they did not put surround sound on this one yet.  Another interesting note:  I own the original one that came out on DVD some years ago.

151956,4,079284565X,"It's time to put your headband and parachute pants on and break out those Grandmaster Flash records for the holy breakdancing trilogy of films. These movies were made pre-Gangsta rap when disputes were settled either on the dance floor or on the mic. Breakin', its sequel, Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, and Beat Street were all released in 1984 and are a fantastic time capsule of their times in all of their cheesy (and in one case not so cheesy) glory.

Looking at it now, Breakin', with its laughably cheesy dialogue (""Blond, brunette - if they're looking for hair why don't they look for gorillas?""), horribly dated `80s fashion (skinny ties! headbands! parachute pants!) and wooden acting, is a harmless, cartoony look at a more innocent time. And let's be honest, that is part of the film's charm.

After the surprise success of the first Breakin' movie a sequel was quickly rushed into production and the result is Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo (great title, btw). Special K, Ozone and Turbo are back and this time out our heroes have come together to save an inner city community centre from a greedy developer who wants to knock it down and put up a shopping centre. They have 30 days to raise $200,000.

Beat Street is the East Coast answer to Breakin' that was grittier, edgier and therefore not as successful but definitely more authentic. Shot on the dirty, grungy, pre-Giuliani streets of New York City, it follows Kenny (Davis), an up-and-coming rapper/DJ who is buddies with Ramon (Chardiet), a gifted graffiti artist who uses the subways and sides of buildings as his canvas.

Unlike Breakin', this is how the hip hop scene really looked and sounded back in the day. Parties take place in the basements of burnt-out buildings in the slums of the city. These guys are all young, poor and hungry to make it out of the ghetto anyway they can. Beat Street also trumps Breakin' in the number of cameos by pioneers of the genre, featuring the likes of DJ Kool Herc, Kool Mo Dee, Doug E. Fresh, Afrika Bambaataa and Melle Mel. This also results in a great soundtrack that shows many of the influences on early hip hop: calypso, salsa, jazz-all thrown into the mix.

Beat Street is everything that the Breakin' films aren't: gritty, cold, gray with characters that swear and even die. It is a fascinating example of the polar ends of the spectrum and this box set collects all three movies for one to immerse themselves in early '80s culture.

MGM has basically repackaged these three movies and so we have Breakin' and Breakin' 2 presented in crappy pan and scan with nothing more than a trailer as an extra. Beat Street can be seen either, pan and scanned or widescreen with a trailer included.

Included exclusively with this box set is a DVD of extras. Sadly, they have almost nothing directly to do with the three films which is a big disappointment. Surely, they could have gotten Shabba Doo and Boogaloo Shrimp back for some new extras? What's Rae Dawn Chong done lately? And where's the deleted scene of Kadeem Hardison cut from Beat Street?

Instead, the focus is on the hip hop culture itself. First up, is ""The Culture of Hip Hop"" which traces the genre's origins. There is a surprising lack of commentary from celebrity pioneers like DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and others. Instead, more obscure (to those not in the know) people talk about the basic elements of hip hop and b-boy culture.

""The Elements of Hip Hop"" breaks it down into four components: graffiti, DJing, breakin' and MCing. This is a pretty decent introduction to the basic components of the culture and a nice companion piece to the first featurette.

""Beat Street Battle: Rock Steady Crew vs. New York City Breakers"" is the only extra that has anything to do with the films in the set and it is just a scene lifted from Beat Street.

""Shout Outs"" is basically a montage of people who were interviewed in the first two featurettes giving thanks to all the people who inspired and supported them over the years.

Also included is a music video for ""Will Not Be Destroyed"" by the Living Legends with loads of nice breakdancing footage.

I have to say 'Beat Street' was the movie of all Break culture movies that made any real sense of what the music and culture was really about.

Of course time has changed but without those days there would not be any of todays Hip Hop, including other types of music. For those that disagree, well that's fine, not everyone in the world will agree to most of anything.

But when you live on the other side of the world and you notice a 'breakdance' movie which has substance and truth to it, then something must be right about the movie.

I own the 'Beat Street' dvd movie and if you loved or still love the Break Culture, then i strongly advice you to purchase this movie. It's a classic and will be a classic however far Hip Hop evolves.

Wild Style, Charlie Ahearn's early hip hop flick, pretty much got it right. Then came this hollywood ripoff about 2 years later.

The story is a melodramatic version of the tale told in Wild Style. The idea of this silly fool (""Ramo""), a damn grown man who would rather paint trains than get a job to feed his girlfriend and baby-who would sympathize with such a moron? Compare this to Lee Quiniones' more authentic prototype in Wild Style. The music consists of the soulless, ultra-computerized, synthesized trash that led to the dark ages of black music of the 1980s (at least the lyrics had not yet reached the negative lows of the gangster garbage to come). Rap was actually on it's way out at the time just before this movie was filmed in the winter of 1983 (it was released that following summer), before Run DMC revived the genre with their much needed shot in the arm. This film shows why it was so bad before their arrival.

The acting is atrocious! Guy Davis supposedly angry speech to Rae Dawn Chong's dance class about exploiting the hip hop culture is so contrived and poorly acted that it causes laughter instead of tension. No wonder he was never heard from in films after this!

The only thing worth seeing here are the break battles early in the film (although breakdancing generally gets tiring to watch after a period of time). The party in the abandoned building with bootleg electricity early in the film (with the beloved Sharah ""Sha-Rock"" Greene of the Funky 4+1 More among others taking a turn at the mike) DOES capture the flavor and spirit of the era well.

The Treacherous Three (with young Kool Moe Dee and Dougie Fresh) are quite amusing in their politically incorrect rap skit about Santa Claus on welfare (""My GI Joe turned out GI gay!""), we get breif glipmses of the legendary hiphop inventor Kool DJ Herc in what amounts to a cameo, as well as a performance or two from Afrika Bambaata's Soul Sonic Force. Melle Mel is in rare form during his pwerful performance of ""Beat Street breakdown."" These factors raise the movie for me from 1 to 2 stars.

If they isolated the appearances and performances of the true rap pioneers on this DVD without the dumb story and bad acting, then it would be worthwhile.",1106870400,7,2461,4.596810933940774

151993,2,079284565X,"""Wild Style was just so ahead of its time. I remember telling Charlie Ahearn, `As soon as this thing comes out, mark my words, Hollywood will eat it.' And Beat Street came out... which was a sappy, watered-down version"" -Blondie's Chris Stein (from the excellent book Yes Yes Ya'll, 2002)

 Beat Street follows a small group of friends around New York City in a disjointed plot designed to showcase the talents of hip hop stars.  Appearances by DJ Kool Herc and DJ Afrika Bambaataa lend credibility, but can not make up for unrealistic elements.  Most notably, although one of the major subplots is about a graffiti writer, set designers painted all off the artwork found in this film.  Union contracts prevented any authentic graffiti from making onto the screen.  Irritatingly, this graffiti writer, Ramon (played by Jon Chardiet), is supposed to be Puerto Rican, but he appears to be your average White guy and falls in and out of a terrible Spanish accent (internet searches could not verify his ethnicity, but he has also played a Ukrainian mystic, a Russian soldier, and Adolf Hitler).

 Beat Street benefits from an impressive battle at the Roxy between the New York City Breakers and the Rock Steady Crew, and the depiction some of the real dangers of life in the hip hop scene (electrocution on the third rail, arrest for breaking, teen pregnancy).  Ramon's battle with ""Spit"", a writer who goes over all his bombs with a simple tag, mirrors the real-life rivalry between Seen and Cap.  However, the inclusion of cheesy love music, far too many White people, and the conviction that gangs and violence died out when hip hop came along make this film a highly inaccurate portrayal of early hip hop culture.

those times are over. I have been reading all the postings from
people who love this movie, but think how you would feel to see
your life and times play out in a movie and done so well it takes your soul back into time. I still live in the bronx, and HIP HOP is still ineffect here but it is not the same man, TV does not copy us now we copy TV. Everyone loves this movie be it the dancing, djing, mcing, I love it because it's real baby, It was done with the real players from that time and that is why this movie will LIVE FOREVER. I knew guy's that would put a bullet in you if you went over there piece aka (graffiti). In New York City if you open the bottom of a light post there is a plug to get electricity, that is how we played are radio with no batteries. That is why THE GODFATHER AND GOODFELLAS are classics because they are time machines done with respect for what they are trying to capture. The movie (BREAKING) will never live in the minds of people because it smelled to much like HOLLYWOOD FAKE BS. There is a rumor that the graffiti in BEAT STREET is fake, are we talking about diamonds, graffiti is a style of art, if it looks like graffiti it is graffiti, who ever did the burners was well schooled in the art of HIP HOP, some look better then the stuff other guy's were doing at that time.

152018,5,079284565X,"The movie Beat Street, has always been one of my favorite movies of all time. Mainly because, it captured three important elements of Hip-Hop, and that was Djing, breaking and Graffiti writing on the subway cars.
  There are so many different scenes that I enjoyed in the movie, but the scene when Kenny was djing in his room before Tracy came in happens to be one of my favorites. I feel this way about that scene because Kenny was zoned out in his own world, and I can relate to this because I'm a dj and I often do this myself. Another one that involves Kenny was when they had the party in the abandoned building, and he starting the party off saying ""It's working.....It's working. Wow what a classic scene.
  The battle scene at the Roxy,was and is still to this day, one of the legendary battles to have gone down in Hip-Hop history. To see all the orignal members of The Rock Steady Crew and The New York Breakers battle was just exciting to see to. Even till this day, I don't know how Crazy Legs, took his sneakers off, after doing a backspin.
  The soundtrack to the movie was excellent just as well. Some of my favorite joints that were played in the movie was, LaLa's ""Into the night"" and C.M.'s ""This could be the night""and also the ""Beat Street Breakdown"" by Melle Mel and The Furious Five. Another one of my favorit scenes, was when Kenny was at The Burning Spear and he was playing D.j Globe and The Whiz Kid's ""Play that Beat"" with I.O.U. by Freeze. Damn, I wish I was there.
  Today, there are websites and books that you're able to look at different pieces from various graffiti artist like ""Lee""- (Wild Style), Dondi-(Style Wars) and Dez just to name a  few. But to actually see it in a movie was a great feeling. Even though a few writers atually did the art work on the subway cars in the movie, Ramon did an excellent job making us believe that he really did it all.
  The movies ""Wild Style"" and ""Style Wars"" were some of the first films to ever be made on this sub-culture. But when, ""Beat Street"" was released, I think it made things brighter for those that were in the darkness about the Hip-Hop culture and what it stood for. Too bad we can't relive the early 80's again.",1080000000,2,2200,4.354523227383863
152019,3,079284565X,"As a movie in it's general sense, Beat Street is not a great film. It's just OK. It's real value is in its history, and being sort of a window to the past...when hip hop was about having fun, and using the art (and not guns) to settle beefs. I would suggest anyone thinking about getting this movie not be too concerned about plot and story, and just enjoy a time that's likely gone forever. I'm lucky to say that I lived through those times, and wish they could come back.
I give the film three stars for story and plot. However, for history and just sitting back and reminiscing about a time long gone, I'll give it 5 stars.
One final word: The Roxy battle scene is one of the greatest modern dance scenes ever committed to celluloid, and almost 20 years later, it still gives me chills.",1071619200,4,789,4.302013422818792

So what did I know about ""Hip-Hop"" really? Not too much, besides I loved the music, and dancing and emcees. I realize there were ""Wild Style"" and the classic ""Style Wars"" but those were documentaries.  I'm not here to compare those 2 amazing flicks to this one.  Beat Street isn't a documentary, it's not factually perfect.  The acting isn't top notch, it's not suppostive to be an exact replica of the Hip-Hop Culture durring that time, IT'S A MOVIE!  The love portions were pretty lame, some of the other scenes were hokey. But, in the end this is great movie. It has graf writing, dj's battling, emcees emcee'ing. I still especially like seeing Kool Moe Dee rappin as Santa Clause (the memories...)  The movie captures the essence of ""Hip-Hop"" fairly well.  Say what you want about things that were incorrect or what have you. This isn't Star Wars and I'm not some obsessed fan who see's every error made in the film.  It was supposive to be entertaining.  It captures all 4 elements og the culture nicely, and the theme song is one of the greatest hip-hop songs EVER. It's almost 20 years later, and the film still holds up well.

152062,3,079284565X,"After Charlie Ahearn's 1983 cult classic, Wild Style or 1984's Hip Hop masterpiece, Style Wars, (to date the most accurate portrayal of Hip Hop culture) there wasn't much ground left to cover in Hip Hop. But that would definitely change if Hollywood's ""culture vultures"" had anything to say about it. Smelling the sweet aroma of urban dollars, eager to cash-in Hollywood exec's with the help of Harry Belafonte, (go figure) embarked on their foray into Hip Hop film. Enter, Beat Street. An honest, but diluted view into an urban culture as rich in spirit and talent as the ghetto children who conceived it some 30-years ago. Unlike Wild Style or Style Wars which used authentic Hip Hop pioneers to convey it's message, Beat Street uses B-list actors and a mediocre storyline to try and win.
Beat Street takes place in NY's smoked-out South Bronx around 1983. For those who didn't know, the President actually declared the South Bronx a national disaster area during the early 80's.  The story deals with a group of talented young men who try and transcend their ghetto surroundings via music, art and dance. Rae Dawn Chong, daughter of pot pioneer Tommy Chong plays Tracy, a young Manhattan dance teacher who falls for a street DJ named Kenny played by Guy Davis. The rest of the crew consists of Lee - Kenny's younger brother and b-boy fanatic; Ramo - the local graffiti artist trying to embrace manhood and Charlie - Kenny's sidekick/resident hustler. A sub-plot is developed around a seedy graffiti vandal named Spit, who for no reason, prowls the subways destroying Ramo's ghetto Picassos. Subsequently, an ""electrifying"" face-off ensues when Spit is caught red-handed (no pun intended) doin' his dirty work.
For the most part, Belafonte's Hip Hop coming-of-age story is acceptable.  If not for the help of genuine Hip Hop pioneers like The Rocksteady Crew, The NYC Breakers, The Treacherous 3, Dougie Fresh and Kool Herc; Beat Street would've been a dead end street. The dope B-boy scenes and some of the MC scenes help to keep the movie afloat. Viewers even get an early glimpse of Latina Freestyle and Salsa star Brenda Star in the Roxy audition scene.  The film's climatic jam for a fallen friend is pretty fly, although I can't figure out why Kenny is lip syncing rapper Melle Mel's lyrics. The DVD version seems to have been rushed as it has ""wack"" cover art and contains no internal artwork as well.  The disk itself bears no image and you can forget about any extras! As classic as this movie might be to some, the DVD version is proof positive that Hip Hop is ""still"" Hollywood's bastard child. --James ""Koe"" Rodriguez.",1006128000,2,2632,4.842222222222222

To me, Beat Street rings hollow and false.  A freind of mine described it rather astutely in saying that it was merely a rip-off of Wild Style with a Hollywood budget.  The graff and the lingo seem forced and awkward, and the entire storyline seems brutally contrived. Wild Style holds a crucial advantage over this film in that it employed true heads (a tip of the cap to Zorro and Fab five freddy) as the characters.  What they may have lacked in acting ability, they more than made up for in lending the film the true essence of hip hop culture.  The characters in Beat Street seem hard to relate to, as though they were saying their lines for the first time.  Despite these major flaws, Beat Street does hold it down as a classic in many ways. The movie is worth watching for the battle scene in the Roxy alone...since the movie was made post-windmill invention (props, crazy legs) the breaks are tight.

152093,5,079284565X,"I was franticly looking for this movie not more than 6 months ago, cannot find it anywhere! . This is a movie that must be seen and owned by anyone who loves hip hop and it's culture. Unlike the other breakdance movies this  one is so well made, not only does it include artist that are the  foundation of hip hop such and melle mel, afrika bambaataa and tina b to  name a few but it outlines the culture, from dj-ing to graffity and  showdowns on the dancefloor. The rocksteady crew are pure ledgens and for  them to be in this movie is just a major bonus. I am propably preaching to  the converted here but if you are into hip hop or just listen to the music,  you have got to get this movie, hopefully it will come out on dvd 'cos the  music would absolutely ROCK.",961804800,17,767,4.135135135135135
152094,2,079284565X,"This film has not aged well.  It was played during a college ""Hip-Hop  conference"" and was very sparsely attended.  It is interesting in that  Harry Belafonte produced the soundtrack or something significant--most  numbers lean toward wastes of time rather than timelessness.  One also gets  a look at the staged life of an MC/performer/composer...the equipment  (especially the ""techie"" stuff that the ""pro""s use) is  comically primitive, exposed due to its questionable relevance to the plot.  The dance scenes, the feigned gang war scenes particularly, not only steal  the show but are in this case the only worthwhile tidbits in the whole  thing.  Sideplots and incidental urban characters abound, and not  surprisingly they only weigh down a very heavy plot.  The final scene caps  off the chintzy histrionics and romance in the most extravagant show of  obsolescence and fantasy possible.  This has definite entertainment value,  but it requires the viewer to ignore the movie and indulge in the guilty  pleasure of hoodlums spinning on their heads, landing squarely on their  suede tennis shoes in a pose that embodies the film.  Raw pre-skool breaks  'n' beats...SPIT on the rest.",961372800,,1188,5.268817204301075
152095,5,079284565X,"This is the ultimate and unique motion picture about hip hop culture which showed a real atmosphere inside the guetto and all the vibe that any soundtrack of an era could show. If you'd worn checked pants and snickers  and still have the tunes of Mr. Bambaatta in your head, please get right  now!",960768000,,297,4.481481481481482
