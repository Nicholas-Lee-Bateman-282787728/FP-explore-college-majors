4670934,5,B005F3XV7Q,I have never laughed outloud during a movie B4 in my life!!! This was a very funny movie for the whole family!!,1310256000,,111,4.090909090909091
4670935,5,B005F3XV7Q,"ZOOKEEPER

It is no secret that I am a Kevin James fan and I guarantee that I will enjoy any thing that the man is in. I LOVED his show ""The King of Queens"" and have loved all of his films including his first Happy Madison film ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"". Would did I love it you may ask, well because of the cast but also because my little cuz loved it. When you go to see these family films with the kids you can't help but enjoy it when you know they are. Well that same thing can be said here with James's latest Happy Madison flick ""Zookeeper"".

Now before I go further I want people to really reread that first paragraph particularly about the kids. I have read many a review on other sites that have been negative towards this film, which is fine. People have the right to their opinion but when you say a film is unrealistic then be realistic in your review. This film is for kids and it is obvious, if you go to see a movie with talking animals then I really don't want to hear you say it is unrealistic. It wasn't made for you it is for the kids therefore the family friendly PG rating it has. Also I have read people talking about a super hot woman let alone two getting with Kevin James could not happen. That is funny because he is actually married to a super hot woman, who actually plays his brother's wife in this movie.

The film follows Griffin Keyes [James] who still yearns for his ex but still loves his job. The thing is his job is what broke them up in the first place since she wanted him to do more with his life. He though loves his job and loves the animals he cares for and they love him back. It is with that said they all decide to help out their favorite Zookeeper and help him get his girl back. Of course in doing so they break the code that says they can not speak to humans. Add in that one of Griffin's fellow workers at the Zoo Kate [Rosario Dawson] could be the actual girl for him and a crazy new boyfriend of his ex played by Joe Rogan is in the picture and you have one entertaining flick.

Now like I said before this film will not be for everybody and any one wanting a serious film will be disappointed. This is indeed a comedy and a family friendly comedy at that aimed towards kids. Kevin James is perfect here in his role as the love struck bumbling type guy, he always is. James is a very funny guy because he is completely believable and likeable. I also like the fact that he likes making films geared towards kids so when they come out I can take my cuz and nieces and nephew to his films. ""Paul Blart"" was a PG film and now this one; add in the animated films like ""Barn Yard"" and it is obvious he likes to make these types of films.

I would also love to point out MMA legend Bas Rutten voices Sebastian the Wolf and legendary MMA trainer Mark DellaGrotte cameos in this film. With that said I would like to say that Bas did an excellent job as the Wolf and was hilarious. Also MMA commentator/comedian Joe Rogan was exactly the right person for the boyfriend of the ex. He is wonderful funny and evil in this, loved him here. Speaking of the ex Leslie Bibb is excellent here plays the perfect gold digger like character who wants to change him. Rosario Dawson as well is wonderful as always in this film and I have to admit that I love her; she is one of my favorite actresses.

Donnie Wahlberg and Ken Jeong are great as well even though they are not in it as much as I would have wanted, especially Wahlberg. From the entire live cast all the way to the voice actors like Adam Sandler, Stallone and them this was a fun flick. You know what, that is what this is all about, fun. For kids or not this is a fun movie, Kevin James and the cast that was put together and talking animals could be nothing but. Any film in which a gorilla voiced by Nick Nolte goes partying at a TGI Friday's has to be fun. That of course is one of many fun scenes in this film, yeah, a fun flick.

I honestly wish I could find the words to really say how much fun this was but I can't. All I can say is that not only was it entertaining but listening to the kids crack up the whole time was wonderful. Also I don't know if every theater with this did this but all the kids got ""Zookeeper"" posters with animal facts on the back. Of course my girl, brother and I got one each as well, got to add that to the movie poster collection. So I do recommend this flick because it is good, it may not be the best film ever depending your taste but it is good. Remember the target audience and go in with that mindset and you will like it. Take the kids as well because they will love it.",1310169600,7,4606,4.094130675526024
4670936,3,B005F3XV7Q,"It's hard to rate a movie like Zookeeper.  On the one hand, no one's going to say that it's a must-see comedy. But on the other hand, it's better than the average film of this sort, and while it's completely predictable, it does manage to keep you entertained and you still laugh even when you know what's coming. And some of the scenes are true comic gold, even if the film as a whole can't maintain that high level.

The plot:  Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) is a zookeeper at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, a job which he loves but which gets him little respect. Particularly from his girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), who dumps him at the beginning of the movie just as he's in the middle of his elaborately planned proposal of marriage, stating that she just can't see herself getting serious with a zookeeper. Crushed, Griffin briefly considers quitting his job and going to work for his brother, Dave (Nat Faxon), who has a high-end car dealership, but Kate (Rosario Dawson), the zoo's vet, talks him out of it. Five years later, when Dave is getting married, Stephanie suddenly reappears. Griffin is just as smitten with her as he was five years before. Now he's seriously considering quitting in order to win her, enough so that the zoo animals - who consider him the best keeper they've ever had - decide to take action. Starting with revealing to a very startled Griffin that they can in fact talk. Knowing that the only way to get Griffin to stay is to help him win Stephanie, they proceed to bombard him with all kinds of mating advice, varying according to the animal giving it. Griffin's attempts to follow their advice have, as one might expect, highly variable and sometimes disastrous results.

Admittedly, high comedy or classic comedy, Zookeeper is not. It's one-hundred percent predictable but you still laugh, mainly because of the talented cast (live and voice actors), who manage to keep things lively enough that you still want to see things unfold in spite of knowing what will happen. Kevin James is perfect as the hapless Griffin (you know you're hapless when you're taking dating advice from talking animals). Leslie Bibb does a nice turn as the gorgeous but devastatingly shallow Stephanie.  And Joe Rogan is deliciously obnoxious as Stephanie's uber-testosteroned boyfriend Gale.

But hey, Zookeeper is really about the talking animals and the film's technical and animal-handling crew did an excellent job, both in making it look like they're actually talking and in managing to give them a lot of physical expressiveness in their roles. The voice-actors behind the live animals were superbly cast and all did a great job of bringing their animal characters to life:  Nick Nolte's gorilla Bernie gives the film a lot of its best moments; Adam Sandler's cheeky monkey Donald, who's always lording his opposable thumbs over the other animals and whose fall-back advice for any situation is ""throw poo at them""; the mated lions - Sylvester Stallone's Joe and Cher's Janet - have some of the best dialogue in the film, arguing like a real married couple over who's better suited to give advice; Judd Apatow's elephant Barry has a fear of confrontation and a hay-eating disorder; Jon Favreau (yeah, that Jon Favreau, director of Iron Man I & II) and Faizon Love are Jerome and Bruce, a couple of male bears constantly ranking on each other, are a riot; and Don Rickles gets in some particularly bad advice as a frog.

There are a few let downs, largely I feel to weaknesses in the script. While some scenes are brilliantly funny, others don't quite hit the mark and a few simply go on too long. And while most of the characters are decently written, a few  were either poorly thought out or inadequately developed. Ken Jeong, who was brilliantly funny in films like Knocked Up, Role Models and The Hangover movies, never quite hits the mark as Venom, a co-worker of Griffin's whose social skills make everyone around him cringe. Donnie Wahlberg is wasted as Shane, a cardboard bad-guy who mistreats one of the animals at the zoo.  And the extremely talented Rosario Dawson, whose veteranarian Kate is key to the plot, isn't really fleshed out enough to make her relationship with Griffin really believeable.

But all that said, Zookeeper remains a decent film that meets the expectations the trailers set up.  Recommended as a light comedy with a few memorable scenes, a pleasant enough way to pass a couple of hours.",1310083200,4,4445,4.818897637795276

And there were too many adult themes and innuendos, that it really wasn't for kids 12 and under to be watching. Literally PG13 meaning don't waste your little kids life filling their mind with senseless Hollywood filler. The first girlfriend is such a jerk she isn't even believable and it took far too long in the plot to get the right girl. This movie may have needed a better editor to make cuts and tie up the loose ends. They may even had made it into a family film, but for adults it was just okay...",1482192000,,637,4.145161290322581

4671029,5,B005F3XV7Q,"This movie is actually quite hilarious, especially the first time you see it. There are definitely some jokes that make you want to groan, but is an overall funny movie. It has a great message about chasing your dreams, not someone else's. It is rather harmless, in words and deeds. The animal portrayal of behavior sets them apart from humans. Showing that people sometimes make dumb mistakes but can learn from those mistakes and come to understand more about themselves and their relationships with others. Although the zookeeper is an animal advocate, and cares about others beside himself, he realizes he is a human and they are animals after all. It is also typical, I am sorry to say, of the attitudes of some in the world today toward those who are attractive and capable of working hard at what they enjoy. There are also some in this world that are typically wealthy lazy people that glut themselves on the riches and finer things of life, as they believe, not having a clue about how the poor middle class actually have to work for a living. Over all there were some slower parts of the movie and some silliness that many of us can actually relate to. I really thought it was a good clean movie and had a lot of positives come from it. I would not be afraid to take my younger children to see it. However it would not appeal to those below the age of about 9. I think more movies of this type need to be produced. Clean, Family viewing with positive messages, with no cursing, and none of the extreme violence of the movies today. Violence is becoming more and more viewed as the norm and I can see many ramifications that are coming from that in this world today. The violence and adultism is so prevalent today in the movies and that is exactly what we are reaping the benefits of in our court rooms today.",1473379200,,1819,4.465465465465465

4671799,4,B005F3XV7Q,"A solid family movie that thankfully isn't full of adult innuendoes.  The premise is straightforward; a zookeeper who goes above and beyond taking care of his animals hits a wall when his girlfriend dumps him.  He struggles to find his place and win back his girlfriend who is more concerned with success than happiness.  Throught the process he learns that animals can talk and starts getting advice from them on how to win her back.

The movie is well paced, a few slow parts but generally keeps you interested in the main character.  The animals are funny, the jokes are great(and clean), and Kevin James does a great job heading the movie.  I think this is a worthy condenter if you have run out of Pixar, Dreamworks movies to watch with the family.

The GOOD:
Kevin James really shines
The animals are hilarious
Minimal adult humor that is inappropriate(a.k.a. Transformers, Antz, ect...)
Great ending

The BAD:
Slow in the middle
Ex-girlfriend plot is the same repeated one in most ""familyish"" movies

Recommend it thoroughly, it is fun and lighthearted and has great replay value.",1428969600,2,1087,4.864130434782608

4671935,2,B005F3XV7Q,"This movie is a romantic comedy with the talking animals as the gimmick.  The plot was absolutely predictable: boy meets girl, girl rebuffs him, years later they reconnect, boy finds girl doesn't suit him after all, so he finds the girl who was better suited to him all along.

So what do the talking animals have to do with it?  They are zoo animals who know how to talk to each other and to humans, but they maintain a code of silence and only speak when humans are not around.  But Griffin is their favorite zookeeper, so they break their code of silence to him in an effort to prevent him from leaving.  They do various things and give advice to help Griffin in his love life, but their advice gives Griffin no real help.  Only the gorilla does him any good by helping to prevent the woman he loves from leaving town forever.

Basically the movie involves a lot of slapstick and some scatology.  It's not for children and not really for adults either.",1393891200,,955,4.417142857142857

4671954,5,B005F3XV7Q,"I thought this film was a pretty awesome family movie.  It was pretty hilarious.  James plays a guy who LOVES being a zookeeper.  Heck, even the animals love him.  But when a girl that dumped him years ago suddenly comes back into his life, he is encouraged by the animals (who talk to him) to go after her again.  The only problem is that she wants him to change... to become something he really isn't.  The animals help him with lessons on how to win his ex back...  then slowly start to regret the decision as she tries to move him out of his life as a zookeeper.

If you like Kevin James's humor... you will like this movie.  The special effects were amazing... I kept wondering how they got the animals to 'act'.  Fans of BOSTON will love the end/credit sequences...  you have to see it... it's hilarious.",1389484800,,810,4.369127516778524

It met all of those expectations. However, overall, it was a really silly movie (expected) with the character animation moderately good. But the oddest things was that the animal voices didn't really seem to fit the animals. I know that they were voiced by some pretty big names (Maya Rudolph, Cher, Sylvester Stallone, etc.) but they were forced accents and somewhat out of character with the kind of animal being portrayed.

If you can rent this cheap (like we did) and you don't care about an hour and a half of your day, then it's okay entertainment. Otherwise, this is worth skipping.",1341273600,,805,4.6223776223776225

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

There's very little about this movie that I didn't like.  First of all, Adam Sandler's voice was just plain annoying when he was doing the voice of the monkey.  I wanted to say to my television, ""Adam, you're trying too hard.  You're better than this!""  Also whoever did the voice of the giraffe was just PAINFUL to listen to.  I wanted to mute my TV everytime I saw that damn giraffe but I didn't cuz I didn't want to miss part of the story.

Also at the end when Kevin James is running around trying to find Rosario Dawson's character cuz he doesn't want her to leave the country before he can talk to her, when he's doing all this running around and trying to catch her...  Why doesn't he just call her?  I'm sure she has a cell phone and since they worked together for five years, I'm sure he has her number.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

So this movie had a basic cookie cutter plot, guy tries to get girl, realizes that he doesn't want her and goes after the girl he has known his whole life that he really loves.  It's pretty funny and I enjoyed it, it was worth my $1.30",1339286400,2,1250,4.341991341991342

4672155,3,B005F3XV7Q,"So once in a while you have to sit back and pop in a movie you think is safe for the kids...when suddenly you find yourself laughing and enjoying the movie more than they are. They're at that age when it's just not cool to laugh at something your parents like as well so they stifle their guffaws as much as possible while you smile and laugh out loud. Too bad because they miss out on some fun movies that way. Movies like ZOOKEEPER.

The movie opens with Kevin James as Griffin proposing on a sandy beach at sunset while riding a horse to the woman he loves, Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). Unfortunately unlike most youtube videos, she turns him down explaining how she thought he'd change and leave behind life working in a zoo. She wants someone more upwardly mobile.

Fast forward a few years and Griffin is still working in the Franklin Park Zoo. He loves his work and he loves the animals he cares for. While taking care of them all, he pays particular attention to Bernie the gorilla. Bernie has kind of sequestered himself from contact with anyone who comes his way including Griffin who tries his best to cheer him up.

Griffin's brother is about to get married and they hold the engagement party at the zoo thanks to Griffin. But as he begins to make a speech about the new couple he notices Stephanie in the background and stumbles on every word out of his mouth. It turns up that Stephanie is back in town and was invited by the bride. Could she and Griffin reunite? As the animals listen in to their conversation it appears a possibility.

That night the animals call a meeting and discuss how to make Griffin more attractive to Stephanie and reunite the pair. If not one of the overheard discussions was Griffin talking about leaving and they want him to stay. Somehow they have to unite the pair and at the same time not let Griffin know they can speak. But of course things go wrong and the main animal, Joe the lion (Sylvester Stallone) lets lose scaring Griffin.

The animals come together and let Griffin know they can talk now and do their best to school him on how to get Stephanie back. The problem is while their intentions are good the ideas they offer him work more in the animal kingdom than in the land of humans.

While all this is going on Griffin helps one of the zoo doctors, Kate (Rosario Dawson). They pair work well together, especially in the case of helping save Janet the lioness (voice of Cher). It was due to Griffin's saving her from choking to death that the animals decided to help.

Taking the advice of the animals Griffin does his best to win Stephanie back. But this time around he not only has to convince her he can be the man she longs for but he must also compete with a Neanderthal of a new boyfriend Gale (Joe Rogan). In an attempt to face off against this jerk, Griffin has Kate go with him to the wedding in an attempt to make Stephanie jealous. But something else begins to happen.
The film offers a back and forth from the world of Griffin's romance to his love of the animals he cares for. Can he leave behind all that he holds dear in an attempt at love with a woman who wants him to be something else? And what about Kate, is something going on there?

The answer is simple if you ever seen a romantic comedy made since say 1925. It's also a staple of the romantic comedy that the main protagonist not realize who he really loves or what he wants to do until the last moments of the film. But knowing this is what will happen or not doesn't matter, it's the journey to that moment that makes this movie such fun.

A huge cast of big names offer voice talent here along with the others mentioned. Adam Sandler plays a monkey Judd Apatow an elephant, Donald Faizon and Jon Favreau a pair of bears and more. All of them have some hilarious lines and moments that are a joy to watch, especially Nick Nolte as Bernie the gorilla. The scenes this character shares with James are a hoot, especially a trip in the outside world to TGIFridays. If you go there you'll be looking for an ape next time.

The movie is fairly predictable but it doesn't matter. It has plenty of laughs, a touching story and holds your interest throughout. James does a great job doing plenty of physical comedy and adds a nice touch to the romantic side he offers, especially not appearing as the normal hunk of the month. All in all this movie offers a good time at any price and is actually one worth adding to your collection. Check it out.",1332806400,4,4466,4.376357056694813

James plays the zookeeper of the title, with serious romantic problems, and a zoo full of animals that he finds out can talk and decide to try and coach him through his romantic woes. There are a few funny moment - a favorite was when he takes the gorilla to TGI Fridays - but mostly it's just a bit too slow. Having the plot revolve around adult romantic issues also just didn't work - talking animal movies are usually skewed to a young crowd (my own are 5 and 7), but they just don't get some of the romance/mating related jokes.

4672194,2,B005F3XV7Q,"Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) is the perfect employee. In addition to being the favorite of all the animals at the Franklin Park Zoo, he's professional, courteous and well-liked by his co-workers. His dedication was only compounded when, five years earlier, he was dumped by his fiance mid-proposal. But when his fiance (Leslie Bibb) comes back into his life at his brother's engagement party, his career soon feels like an albatross around his neck.

  Fearing the loss of their favorite zookeeper, the animals (voiced by Sylvester Stallone, Nick Nolte, Cher and others) intervene. They reveal the fact that they can speak and always could and then proceed to offer Griffin whatever help they can in winning back his former girlfriend. The attempts and advice vary in detail but what it all amounts to is a slapstick tsunami. It can enhance a storyline when used correctly but the use of it in this film is meant to replace one. It makes for a lot of laughs, but not a lot of originality. Basically, if you've seen the commercial, you've seen the movie.",1326499200,2,1052,4.833333333333333

I knew going into it that it was a PG movie and I can say that it is a PG movie.  However, you have to wonder who these folks targeted the movie for... because it just misses on all levels.  Most ""normal"" adults aren't going to enjoy this;  it's not bad, but it's basically juvenile.  Some scenes and episodic language isn't for those below Jr High... and those young kids are the ones that are typically going to watch talking animal movies.
2.  Bottomline, this movie could have been pretty good, if it just focused on one target audience;  ie young kids and their parents and cleaned up the language / certain situations... but they didn't and as a result, this movie is already headed for the trash heap of has been films that will be lost to memory etc...",1324857600,4,863,4.383647798742138

4672242,3,B005F3XV7Q,"Kevin James is a good comic actor, when the comedy is slapstick physical humor or one-line zingers. He has the emotional range of a bowl of porridge. So this movie is fun when he's doing pratfalls or exchanging quips with the animals. When he puts on his plaintive face and tries to be serious, it descends to mush. He's not helped by some of the most trite dialog ever written and a plot that is obvious within the first five minutes.

Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb do their best with caricatures rather than characters. I wish they'd been given something more meaty to work with- both could have played good comic roles if they'd been given the chance. However, the animals aren't expected to be serious so they get most of the best lines and the best action.

This is a light-hearted way to spend an evening when you don't want anything thought-provoking and you'll get some good laughs along the way. That can't be a bad thing.",1322265600,,932,4.541666666666667

If you are a conservative Christian you may not enjoy this movie. The summary of the movie is a man that works at a zoo and the animals talk to him and coach him on how to win a woman's heart.
A wolf teaches him to urinate on his territory, a bear teaches him to show his ""pudding cup"", his groin.
The gorilla seem to be the only animal who had wisdom.
I didn't enjoy this film because I'm tired of this generation that thinks the only premise of a movie is sexual undertones in a rated PG or PG-13 and sadly some G rated.

4672263,1,B005F3XV7Q,"I love Kevin James.  I think that he is hilarious.  I knew walking in that `Zookeeper' had the poor reviews that usually indicate a real stinker, especially in this genre, but I always consider Kevin James a presence that can and usually does make even a terrible film worth watching at least once.

Yeah, not so much for this one.

Honestly, `Zookeeper' may be the worst film I've seen in a very long time.  There is very little funny here, in fact possibly nothing at all.  I think the ONLY time I even cracked a smile was during the wedding scene, and half of that was out of sheer awkwardness (but it was semi-humorous at that).  Overall, this film is a gigantic mess; a mix of wasted talent and uninspired regurgitation of potty humor that never hits where it intends.

The story is that of an oaph of a man; Griffin.  He is a large bodied, simple living zookeeper that is undeniably sweet natured and so, somehow, a girl as hot and self-centered as Leslie Bibb is interested in dating him, only to reveal that his profession is too much for her to handle and so she turns his marriage proposal down.  Years later he's still dwelling in misery over it all.  He complains about his loneliness to his animal friends at the zoo and so when they see an opportunity to get Griffin and his long lost romance back together, they take action.  Soon they have Griffin roaring and walking with his package extended and peeing in potted plants and basically making a total fool of himself and yet, magically, it starts to work.  But, in changing himself he begins to regret his decisions and, well, you'll guess from the pretty early on who he's going to wind up with anyways; but that's the nature of the beast.

Sadly, this talking animal flick has nothing to offer.  The animals are the worst part of the film.  I remember when Eddie Murphy did `Doctor Doolittle'.  Honestly, it was pretty clever and while some of the gags were predictable they were effective.  This is such a polar opposite.  The animals are crude and unfunny, and their interactions and staged comedic dialog is awkward and far too lowbrow for its own good.  The voice work, especially Sandler's, is obnoxious and cringe-worthy.  The `message' aspect of the film is poorly executed (the mean caretaker side of things was an afterthought entirely) and certain sequences are just too ridiculous (TGIF) that it makes this whole experience a complete and total waste.

I still love you Kevin; I just advise you to steer clear of Adam Sandler.",1320019200,7,2505,4.619909502262443

The movie is clean: it has no nudity and no bad language I can remember. The scatological humor is kept to a minimum. Since a monkey is one of the most talkative characters, scatological humor could have taken over the show.

The only negatives are the plot and some of the bizarre characters. The plot is just full of holes. A person starts hearing animals talk and never seeks help? A couple of the minor characters are strange and not really funny. However, in a screwball comedy these defects are really minor.

So, we passed on it in the theatres, and just bought it on Blu-ray on release day...Way better than expected for me (and of course the kids loved it too, for the talking animals)...looking for a good family flick, you can't go wrong with this one.

Not that big of a fan of Kevin James movies (Paul Blart - awful in my opinion), so I was a little skeptical but he didn't bug me in this one, more of his ""cute"" personality in this one and the scenes with the gorilla were just awesome!

Well, instead of upping the lithium or seeing a shrink, Kevin James, a lovelorn zookeeper, actually listens to the stupid advice the animals in his care share about finding and keeping a mate.  Naturally, things do not go well when he applies animal habits to his human problems.  This wildly uneven film has a few laugh-out-loud moments, especially in the too infrequent throwaway lines (Gorilla: ""Hey, can I try on your watch?"") the animals toss out.

But by far, the best thing about this misfire is the nice animal voice work and special effects. I especially liked the animatronic gorilla head with its uncanny lifelike facial movements that were not CGI.  Inexplicably, Kevin James remains a sweet, rotund comic foil.

  Attractive and talented actresses always do Happy Madison films ""for some reason"", Rosario Dawson (Clerks 2) is the latest but she surprisingly shines. Surprisingly, since the women characters are usually one dimensional and especially don't get to do much in an Adam Sandler movie.
  While Sylvester Stallone, Cher and Nick Nolte do good jobs in voice roles for animals. I'm not sure what Adam Sandler was going for with his Jewish old man voice....for a monkey though, his voice acting is awful.

If I give it away, I might give away the entire movie, but to me it's more about a love story than it being about the animals.

4672334,4,B005F3XV7Q,"I thought it was ok. A light romantic comedy. Suitable for kids. I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, but the kids wanted to watch this movie, so I went along. I did expect a bit more of it, it was quite predicable, but it was entertaining. And the kids liked it. Talking animals always seem to have magical effect on kids, and ... it was fun.",1310515200,,346,4.102941176470588
8469514,5,B005F3XV7Q,"RELEASED IN 2011 and directed by Frank Coraci, ""Zookeeper"" is a dramedy/fantasy/romance starring Kevin James as a (you guessed it) zookeeper in Boston who enlists the aid of the zoos animals in his attempt to win the affections of model Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) or, maybe, fellow zoo-worker Kate (Rosario Dawson).

This amusing and heartwarming movie succeeds where Doctor Dolittle (1998) barely gets by. Its also more relevant to adults in light of the romantic shenanigans, albeit still family friendly. Everything hinges on whether or not the movie can pull off the animals as (talking) characters while keeping you invested in the drama. And it does, incredibly. I actually found myself caring about one of the animals in particular. As always, James makes for a likable every-guy protagonist. And Dawson is winsome.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot in Franklin Park Zoo & Boston, Massachusetts, as well as Central Park, Manhattan (for the bike race). WRITERS: Jay Scherick, David Ronn, Kevin James, etc.
