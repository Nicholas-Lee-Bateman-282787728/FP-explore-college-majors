We remain the greatest country on earth. Although the CIA, does have plenty of garbage.",1524873600,,252,4.883720930232558
7934939,1,B00005A3KR,Please watch this.......so you can see what a bad movie really looks like.,1514592000,,74,4.769230769230769
7934940,2,B00005A3KR,"Seriously the worst movie I have ever seen an every category. The story made no sense, the acting was terrible, special affects were, well, ""special"" If you watch closely you can get a good laugh out of it anyway. IN one scene, a ""Ranger"" dies. The main guy closes his already closed eyes and then before they go to the next scene, the dead guy opens his eyes and smiles..... Frickin hilarious! One chick runs to hear dying lover and does a classic hair flip before crying as he passes. If you pause the big assault scene, some of those guys don't even have guns. They have sticks, revolutionary war muskets, 2x4's, canoe paddles and whatever else they could get a hold of.

I don't recommend watching it as an action movie. You're better off watching squirrels fight in a bird feeder. But like I said, I did get a good laugh out of it.",1390348800,,836,4.393548387096774
7934941,3,B00005A3KR,"This movie was bought for my fiance. I'm not sure how much he likes the movie over-all.  I do know how ever that he was disappointed with the wide-scren format the bars are really thick.  He dosn't care for anything in wide screen but when the bars take half of the screen, he realy don't like and I don't care to watch those movies that come like that either.",1282348800,2,360,4.202898550724638
7934942,1,B00005A3KR,This movie is a low buget movie. I bought it thinking that there was going to be a lot of action but I was quickly disapointed. The begining was ripped from Navy Seals and the ending from Invasion America. Your better off buying these movies instead of this one!,1046131200,,262,4.36734693877551
7934943,5,B00005A3KR,"All I know is this movie ROCKED DA HOUSE!! Lloyd Braun was awesome- I can't wait for the sequel. Brian Dennehy is awesome as the general, and Corbin Bernson hasn't been this awesome since Major League III: Back to the Minors. The women are unbelievable and Lloyd Braun's has a great body! I recommend this movie to everyone! I am fifteen and I want to see more movies like this one. Keep up the good work!! I couldn't expect better work from the director of Vampirella and Body Chemistry 4. I applaud you.
My girlfriend especially loved it- and she is a complete dolt.  My recommendation is to grab this movie, a bucket of popcorn, and a pookah shell necklace and you are straight.  Lloyd Braun- keep it up.  And this was like a million times better than navy seals.  That movie was stupid.",1045612800,3,790,4.465277777777778
7934944,1,B00005A3KR,"If I coud give this movie a negative star, I would.  This movie also appealed to me by the box cover.  I was hoping for some real gunfights like in Rogue Force or Black Hawk Down.  However the only connection I could find between this movie and the US Rangers is the movie title.  I counted 1/2 of all the gunfight scenes were ripped from other movies such as Navy SEALS (I think I saw Charlie Sheen in one scene) Invasion USA and others.
The acting was that like the first Resident Evil game (if you've played it) totally monotone on Bernsen's behalf.  It was just plain awefull.  The stereotypical African American characters were just sickening.  In the first scene, one of them starts talking 'ghetto' and starts comparing his equiptment to his Grandmother's 'equiptment' which was absolutly sick.
And like heck the US would let some 100+ terrorists invade the US.  They would stop them dead in their tracks, and on top of that, this appeared to be an ambush and the national guard still bouched it up.  Yeah right!  And what moron could break into the CIA headquarters with a LAW rocket launcher and launch it and get away with it.  Maybe a CIA or Delta Boy could do it but a Ranger, no way.
Oh, and while we're talking about Rangers.  I'm no Ranger but I believe the Ranger creed is ""Leave No Man Behind"" as stated on the Black Hawk Down cover.  Well in the first scene what do they do?  They leave not only one, but two men behind.  And what's funny is Bernsen talks about how he never leaves a man behind later on in the film.
I can't believe I fell for buying this one.  I guess they were right when they said ""Don't judge a movie by it's cover.""  I strongly recomend NOT buying this one.  If you like gunfights and military spec ops, buy Rogue Force, Black Hawk Down, Navy SEALS or Saving Private Ryan.  They're a WHOLE lot better then this seat filler.",1026950400,4,1863,4.3790087463556855
7934945,1,B00005A3KR,"I rented this thinking as others have, that there would be some good tactical warfare.
There is none so I was disapointed, its actually kind of funny in a weird way (the lead actor looks scared 90% of the time-guess he knew that the script blows chunks) and he blinks every time he pull the trigger. Perhaps he should lay off the coffee and work at the 7-11.
Bad story waek acting and generally a true ripoff.",1006819200,2,409,4.324675324675325
7934946,1,B00005A3KR,"If you're looking for a tactical action adventure... go rent Navy Seals or Rogue Force... This extremely low budget movie was produced directly to DVD - so you can imagine the below average presentation. Most of the action contained within the movie are footage taken from other movies - Red Heat, Navy Seals, Invasion USA (much superior movies with larger production budgets). The one saving grace to this DVD is the informative commentary by the Director and main lead actor. They often point out the low budget techniques they utilized along with humorous comments on their own movie. Like the dude above, I was attracted to the box art - hoping for an action movie that has desert warfare - the kind of work REAL Army Rangers do (there's absolutely NO real warfare in this movie).
This, along with US Seals are a sick kind of diversion for people with too much time and money on their hands. Rent it for the Commentary if you have absolutely nothing to do (and if you're made of money). Buy it? Send me 30 bucks so I can kick you in the balls - it's a kinder fate.",987811200,4,1068,4.482051282051282
7934947,1,B00005A3KR,"I was attracted by the cover of this DVD. The cover, as you can see, was related to the Engulf war. However this is totally not the case..... The story of the ""Rangers"" is nothing about the engulf war. Moreover, there is rare gun fight in the movie. The worst thing which i can't believe is that i find many scene of the film are copied from a old movie called ""navy seals"".... How come !!!!!! This is the worst DVD i have ever brought.",987465600,2,436,4.141176470588236
