622794,5,6303269850,"I began my own study of Budhism at the age of 13 in Minnesota, and went on to study in Kyoto at age 20.  At 50 I first encountered Little Buddha and consider it among the finest introductions to the life of the spirt in  Buddhism that one can find.  My son--6 years old--loves everything but the  appearance of Mara, the embodiment of illusion.  It is not clear that this  is an entertaiment flick.  I do not take it to be such.  Is it really  necessary that the spirit be entertaining.  This is what has gone so wrong  with Christianity.  Ministers and Priests have become entertainers.  What  one witnesses in Little Buddha is the actual presence of a spiritual quest.  Not something we find in the West these days.  Keanu Reeves is exquisite  as the young Buddha. The rest of the cast is excellent.  This may not be a  movie for those who want to be entertained, but it is one for those who  want to take the first step on the path to enlightenment.  My son, while  frightened by Mara--as all of should be, for we are in his grip--now sits  in meditation, and studies the Kalachakra mandala because of the movie.  He  is wiser for it.  This movie should be in the collection of anyone who  seeks to enlarge their experience of life and the depth of our being.",949622400,,1262,4.35064935064935

622796,3,6303269850,"I must admit that I am a great Bernardo Bertulluci fan.  I think that his films - even when they are good and not great(""Stealing Beautey,"" for example)are interesting and have something substantial to say.  This  film is no exception to this mold, with the disapointing fact that it is  far from great - though it does have moments of greatness.
  On the  positive, most of the cast is good, with Bridge Fonda giving another grand  performance.  Yet, Reeves is not 100% fit for the role - though he does  give a worthy effort.
  What goes wrong here?  For one, the ""back  and forth"" angle of the movie is disapointing.  Most viewers care  little about the modern story and want to stay on the traditional story of  the Buddha, which is great for those who know nothing of it.  Another is  Reeves.  He partially hurts the high points of the film.  Another factor is  the timing.  By the end of the film, you are and worn out - not a good  sign.
  Yet, this film, once again, does have its high points.  Some  parts of the film show what a great director Bertulluci is and how high he  could fly.
  If you want great Bertulluci, then try ""Last  Tango in Paris,"" ""The Last Emperor"" and - my favorite -  ""1900.""",939686400,3,1208,4.345454545454546

Through watching it together, we both became familiar with some of the basic teachings and were both warmed by  the many scenes that happened during the movie.  We both learned from many  of the underlining messages, and both really enjoyed watching it.  A  definite must see if you are in search of 'the miraculous' as P.D.

622841,3,6303269850,"Be warned this movie has been heavily edited. I did no know that and bought it to stream. I should have rented it first and then I would have seen the butcher job done on this film. I previously saw it on Netflix in it's original format.  What's went missing is confounding as well. Sidddhartha's decision to become and ascetic. They cut him switching robes with a poor man. Suddenly he is sitting in rags with a cobra on his head. Next gone is the Lama's Norbu's explanation of the meaning of the symbolism of the Stupa and why it's shaped that way. Also his telling Jesse to always follow the group when spinning the prayer wheel in the correct direction.  Jesse's comment about the tiger tooth and the far out story of grandpa getting eaten by a tiger. The edited version makes him seem he buy's the story, unedited he does not. The kids have a question and answer session where they choose a the hat they like best and so on so the monks can decide to choose who they feel is right, that's gone, suddenly they all get chosen without the why of how they all made the cut. (Besides the leader babbling in a trance that is) The blessing of pouring libations on the kids heads after being chosen is gone. Lama Norbu entering the room with a monk sewing ( that monk leaves the room) at a machine to meditate his death is
gone Norbu is just  suddenly sitting there. The photography is great as is the soundtrack and the 2 story lines are wonderful. The heavy handed editing (why?) is very annoying to someone who has seen this before the way it is supposed to be seen.

622869,5,6303269850,"The story has two plots one tells of a Buddhist priest searching for the reincarnation of his dead teacher, while the other tells the story of Siddhartha, the Buddha. The story starts with the n modern-day Tibet and a monk, Lama Norbu, who receives a letter telling him that the reincarnation of his teacher may have been found. When he go to follow the news another monk tells him that he had a dream that their old teacher led him to the same empty spot on a hill over and over again and he point at the hill. One day monk came to the same spot that he had dreamed about and saw a house there. A family lived there with the child name Jesse and monk believe that Jesse is their teacher reincarnated. The monks visit Jesse and gave him the book about Buddha. Jesse's father came to the monks and calls the story of Buddha a myth and while he respect Tibetan culture and religion he does not believe in reincarnation. The monk tries to explain reincarnation to Jesse's father. The monk tells Jesses father that if Jesse goes to Nepal with them he can become a strong figure in Tibetan culture. Jesses father got angry and took his son and left. On his way he received a call that his friend and business partner Evan died in car accident. This changed his mind he came home and told his wife that he thinks Jesse should go to Nepal with the monks .he will also go with Jesse. There were also two other candidates for the reincarnated teacher Raju and Geeta. Lama Norbu goes to the Oracle to find out which child is the reincarnation of their teacher. After finding the reincarnation of the teacher Lama Norbu tells Jesse's father that its his time to rest and he is at the peace now. The highlight of the movie was flashback from Siddhartha s life I think it was done perfectly. They also changed the colors when the present-day scenes from Nepal and the flash-backs to the story of Buddha, everything was warm and done in oranges and reds while all present scenes were done in blue and grayish color. Acting was really good by all actors but my favorite was Siddhartha (Played by Keanu Reeves) gives a balanced performance and never goes overboard.
This movie relates to world religion because it has all the information about Siddhartha and how he became Buddha. This movie helps me visualize what I learned in my religion class and read it in the book. This movie also helped me visualize the way people used to dress up back in that time and helped me get into to see the Buddhist culture. This movie helped me a lot with learning about recreation in Buddhism. This movie is very good to learn about Buddhism.

622911,5,6303269850,"This is a Bertolucci movie so it will naturally have his style. This is a different story so it should be told differently from his other films. In my opinion this is his best. It is based on a true story; this means he did not wake up in the middle of the night with a radical idea. The story is used not only for the individual incident but as an allegory for today's Tibetan (there are many other types) Buddhist way of thought.

These are not two parallel stories in contrast. With out one the other makes no sense. The section in Seattle is filtered in blue; I may have some deeper meaning; I see the blue filtered scenes as the superficial environment. These differences help with the description of impermanence.

The Selection of actors is excellent.. You do not want the actor personalities to overshadow the character. It is too late for me. I will always think of Siddhartha as looking like Keanu Reeves.

Just as with Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments "", the film story does not actually follow the written story of Siddhartha. However, as this is the one that I watch, therefore I will always think of this when some one mentions Buddha.

Even after having watched this film more than a dozen times (I teach courses in religion) this film continues to educate, inspire, and  enchant. The story plays off of the idea of the incarnated self as divided into three parts: (1) mind (symbolized by water); (2) voice (symbolized by air); and, (3) body (symbolized by earth). Knowing this teaching of the three-fold nature of self (and the three bodies of the Buddha) is instrumental to appreciating the culmination of this story, especially the triple cremation, which is richly, warmly, and sometimes humorously told. The fact that most of the actors are actual Tibetan monks brings a realism to this tale that is truly rewarding. The scenes of Buddhist monasteries and Dharma centers are also vividly and realistically depicted. The script is brilliant and realistic and the directing and cinematography compelling.

They travel to Seattle where Jesse is and spend time with him and his family. They end up giving Jesse a book on the life of Prince Siddartha- all of which he reads and enjoys. Jesse learns more and more about Buddhism all the while his parents are having difficulties due to his fathers work. The Buddhist monks talk his parents-despite their apprehension- to allow Jesse to come with them to Bhutan to be tested. While in Bhutan, Jesse learns that there are two other children that are believed to be the reborn of the great Buddhist teacher Lama Dorje.

He is shown denouncing his regal upbringing, abandoning his family, and he also ate and drank enough to stay alive.

This movie is about reincarnation within the Buddhist culture. The movie stars Keanu Reeves as Siddhartha and Bridget Fonda as the mother of an American child that is in the running for a reincarnated leaders soul. It begins with the search for a reincarnated Tibetan priest Lama Dorje.
Lama Norbu is looking to connect with his reincarnated leader, Lama Dorje. His search leads him to young Jesse Conrad from Seattle, Washington, Raju, a boy from Katmandu, and Gita, an Indian girl. Together, they journey to Bhutan where the three children must undergo a test to prove which one is the true reincarnation. Along the way we hear the story of Siddhartha.  After finding his teacher the monk then meditates and dies and starts the process over again.
The second story is about Siddhartha and how he became the Buddha. It traces his spiritual journey from ignorance to true enlightenment. Young Siddhartha lived a carefree life in the palace. His father, Kind Suddhodana, is shielding him from all unpleasantness such as elderly, sick or dying people. One day while attending a parade, Siddhartha sees and elderly man and wonder what is wrong with him. His companion, Channa, begins to explain all the mysteries that Siddhartha has never seen. Gradually however, Siddhartha begins to get curious about the world beyond the gates, and one day he sneaks away from the palace. Siddhartha comes in contact with suffering, desires, and death. This is where he begins his journey towards enlightenment and the becoming of Buddha.
This movie really opens your eyes to the basic concepts of Buddhism and the theme of reincarnation. It is a nice starter film for anyone trying to learn the beginning of the Buddhist culture.",1392768000,,1794,5.040404040404041

I'm currently taking a course on World Religion and this movie gives me a visual presentation of what I'm reading and learning in the book. One of the instructions Lama Norbu left the children with before he died was, ""To feel compassion for all beings, to give of oneself, and above all to pass on knowledge like the Buddha."" This is a common theme in Buddhism. The movie started out stating that no creature should be sacrificed. This movie portrays Buddhists as calm, happy, and unaffected by circumstances. The book, ""Invitation to World Religions"" would say that is the ultimate goal, the state of nirvana; or the state of awareness that is without beginning and without end.
The movie presented the story of Siddhartha, who becomes the Buddha. The movie paints a picture of death as no old age, no suffering, no fear, and no pain. Death is not something one should fear and hide from, but rather see death as a part of life that ushers us into the next season of life. Both the movie and the book describe life as constantly changing; continually in a state of flux. It's  ""the shifting of patterns of interacting energies that are constantly combining, dissolving, and recombining into a seemingly infinite variety of forms,"" according to the authors of ""Invitation to World Religions."" The belief of Buddhism is that most suffering comes from humans not understanding the shifting patterns and viewing these patterns as an integral part of our sense of self. Buddha believed that presumptions and misapprehensions were an insufficient basis to comprehend reality and so taught ""non-self."" The way to end suffering is to let go of the ""me"" or ""mine"" and just be.
As I learn different religions, the way people are taught, what people believe, and how people live in relation, I am finding that there are many things I have to learn. I can take a piece of Buddhism and relate it to MY everyday life. There are concepts and precepts that you can take from Buddhism that have the potential to make your life more enjoyable and make you a better person. I enjoyed this movie, learned from this movie, and would recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning more about religions.

623054,5,6303269850,"Little Buddha is a very interesting tale mixed in with a history lesson of Buddhism. This movie was about Buddhist monks from Tibet who are in search of their recently departed teacher. The monks believe in reincarnation so they go on a journey to find the reincarnate of Lama Dorje. They find 3 candidates for his reincarnate and they pursue each one in America and Kathmandu. They put the candidates through little tasks that involve picking objects that once belonged to Lama Dorje. Although unusual, all 3 candidates picked the right object which is a rare occurrence.
This movie which is mainly about finding the reincarnation of their teacher, Lama Dorje, also tales the tale of Siddhartha. We begin learning about the roots of Buddhism through a book given to one of the candidates, Jesse. During these scenes in the movie we learn about the first Buddha who was born 2,500 years ago underneath a tree in a forest. They tell of how he was strong enough to walk and right after birth said, This is my last birth. I am here to reach full enlightenment and put an end to all suffering. The astrologer who predicted Siddharthas future said he could be the master of the world or its redeemer which did not make his father, the king, happy. The king wanted Siddhartha to rule like him but after seeing the 4 signs (sickness, old age, death, and then a monk) he decided to begin his journey to the path of enlightenment. In the movie we also see stupas and prayer wheels. Lama Norbu explains the significance of a stupa and tells them to remember to walk clockwise around it. Towards the end we learn about impermanence which is part of the 3 marks of existence found in Buddhists doctrines. Impermanence in this movie is the reason why there are 3 separate reincarnations of Lama Norje.",1383609600,,1788,4.643533123028392
623055,3,6303269850,"Little Buddha was a good movie. It tells the story of Tibetan Monks searching for their late teachers reincarnate. In the search, they travel to the United States and befriend the first candidate, Jesse, and his parents. They give Jesse a childrens book on the story of Buddha and his journey to enlightenment and he becomes very interested in it. Jesses father is having trouble with his job so when the monks ask if Jesse can travel to Tibet with them his father agrees that they will both go. Once in Tibet, Jesse meets the other candidates. One is a young boy who travels with the circus and the other is young educated in the religion of Buddhism. The movie incorporates to the story of Siddhartha, the Buddha, into the plot line and it is when all three candidates are together that the monks finish the story of Siddhartha and his transformation to the Buddha. In the end it is determined that all three children are the reincarnate that they were searching for.
This movie tied in very well with the Buddhism section of my World Religion class. The story of Siddhartha and how he reached nirvana was very accurate according to our textbook. Little Buddha did a great job explaining Buddhist philosophy of reincarnation, nirvana, samsara, and the respect for all living beings. They explained the importance of mediation and what impermanence means. The philosophy of things dying or ending and being recycled, or reborn, played a large part in the movie. They explained the belief that the mind and soul is a different notion than the body. The body is just a vessel and that our mind and/or soul remains the same in any context, whether in the body or out. Even my husband was interested in learning more about Buddhism after watching this movie.",1383523200,,1755,4.719869706840391
623056,4,6303269850,"I thought this movie was very adorable. A cute entertaining but still education family movie. This is a movie about Tibetan monks who are on the search for the reincarnation of a deceased teacher of theirs, Lama Dorje. There first interest is a young boy who lives in Seattle with his open minded mother and not so open minded father. The father in the beginning thinks that it is unhealthy to tell a six year old boy that he could be the reincarnation of a Buddhist monk. That his imagination could carry him away. His mother on the other hand thinks it could be a great life experience and that Jesse, the young boy, could learn a tremendous amount from the monks. Later into the movie appear two other children who are thought to possess the reincarnated soul of the Lama. The three children are then taken to the monks monastery where it will be decided which one is the true reincarnation. Alongside this story line the life story of the Buddha Siddhartha himself is being told.
The story of Buddha as told in this movie is very similar and lined with what I have so far learned in my world religions class. From birth he claimed he would reach enlightenment. It was known he would be something great even by the trees. His mother passed away when he was only a baby and it was then decided by his father that he would protect him from suffering. Though he did live a very sheltered life he eventually left his castle walls and saw the city for himself where he was introduced to suffering through the elderly, the sick, and the dead. He set out on his quest to achieve enlightenment and become the awakened one, aka Buddha. As learned in my world religions class it is also learned in this movie that Buddhist are great believers that we are reincarnated until we reach enlightenment. Once this occurs there is one last death and our spirit goes on to Nirvana. One analogy that I greatly enjoyed in this movie was when Lama Norbu filled a cup with tea and then broke the cup and exclaimed that the cup was no longer a cup but the tea was still tea it was just somewhere else now.",1383523200,,2085,4.418181818181818
623057,5,6303269850,"This is a fabulous, beautiful, amazing film that offers insight to the Buddhist religion and life itself.

623058,4,6303269850,"Little Buddha is the story of Tibetan Monks who are in search of the reincarnated Buddhist Teacher named Lama Dorje. It starts out when Lama Norbu receives a message that a candidate has been found and may possibly be the reincarnation of Lama Dorje. The candidate is named Jesse and he is an American boy that lives in Seattle. The monks travel to Seattle to try to meet the boy.

The monks meet Jesse and his parents, Dean and Lisa. However the parents are leery of the monks. When the monks tell them they want to take Jesse to be tested to see if he is the Lama Dorje they get upset. Meanwhile Deans close friend and business partner commits suicide because his company went bankrupt. This turn of events changes Deans mind and he decides to travel to Bhutan with Jesse to be tested. In Nepal two more candidates are found and are also children. All three children get to meet each other. Their names are Raju and Gita.

Intertwined in the movie the story of Prince Siddhartha is told. Lama Norbu gave Jesse the book which tells the story of Budda. You see scenes that go between what is really happening with Jesse, Raju and Gita and the story of Buddha is also being reenacted as the children learn about Buddha.

In the story of Buddha there is a prince named Prince Siddhartha. Despite his privileged lifestyle he has a feeling that he is supposed to be doing something else with his life. Even though his father tries to protect him from seeing or experiencing human suffering Prince Siddhartha sets out to see his city. During his visit outside his palace he encounters aging, sickness and death. This leaves him feeling sad and with a desire to understand and solve the problem of suffering. He encounters many difficulties in his search of the truth. He battles a demon named Mara. This demon tries to tempt him and scare and intimidate him. Mara is supposed to represent the ego. Siddartha through meditation and complete detachment realizes that he is facing his own ego and that it is not real. Once he realizes this he becomes the Buddha, or the enlightened one.

At the end of the movie the tests prove that all three of the kids are reincarnations of Lama Dorje. He manifested himself in three ways, his body in Raju, his speech in Gita and his mind in Jesse. After this is discovered and announced the Lama Norbu has finished his work and he goes into deep mediation and then dies. When the funeral starts you can see him speaking to the children giving them the message to be compassionate and to share their knowledge.",1382745600,,2539,4.549234135667396
623059,4,6303269850,"This is story of teachers reincarnation into three potential candidates from around the world. These children are then taken to Bhutan for affirmation.  Within the course of telling the children's story the story of Buddha is told in a touching way. There is much to learn and much to think about in this movie.  It is a great family story, dealing with life, death, suffering, hope and rebirth.",1381708800,,395,4.794117647058823

The inclusion of Mara in the story was definitely an interesting part, as it helped me relate to my studies in World Religions in my high school class.

The subject of reincarnation is well explained and makes you think deep about what we have always been told about what happens after we die. This is a story that both young and old will be able to understand.",1366848000,,504,4.489130434782608
623087,5,6303269850,"This movie is one of those rare one's where the whole greatly exceeds the sum of its parts.  It is dramatic without being melodramatic.  Bertolucci's love for its subject matter, Buddhism, does not come across, IMHO, as proselytizing.  Some religion peddlers attempt to make sure, however subtly or bluntly, we are told ""why God loves us best.""  In my mind, the wonders of the natural world and human acts of charity and kindness are all the marketing God needs.  The cinematography, music, direction, editing, and acting make for a harmonious, transcendent experience.  When I saw this film in the theaters I left en-awed.  Seeing this on DVD does not replicate that experience due to the one of a kind nature of those experiences.  Second, third, or fourth experiences all have their value must there is only one first impression.  If I could take only 10 to 15 movies with me to a deserted island this one would be amongst those select few.

Any practitioner of Buddhism who is upset about the depiction needs to lightened up and get deeper into your faith from a realistic stand point. This is a movie, meant to entertain, and if it hits on some true points, well okay. Keanu Reeves is a hot looking Buddha and he's no Oscar contender.

An interesting journey for the Seattle family; we learn about Buddhism as they learn about Buddhism. I really enjoyed watching it as did my kids. My son aged 9 was really taken with the story of Buddha. But, honestly, on another level, it seemed a bit over top, as if the director's primary goal was to show us the beauty and perfection of Buddhism; I mean almost to the extent that it seemed like a PR movie for Buddhism.

623163,5,6303269850,"I have owned and enjoyed this film since it's release on video.  Coming from a background of Buddhist study, I found this to be a very accessible and welcoming introductory film into the philosophy of Buddhism for a Western audience.  The story covers the life of the Buddha, as well as that of a contemporary child, and his family's intersection with this centuries old faith tradition.  Because Buddhism shares little that is familiar in it's origins with the Abrahamic faiths which predominate in America and the Western world, the stories about the early life of the Buddha are retold, with great beauty and respect, so they become understandable and relevant.  This is intertwined with the adventures of the American child and his family, as they struggle to face decisions that they had never before contemplated, concerning their own lives and work, as well as the future of their son, who now has a variety of paths open to him.  The photography is outstanding, and the music stands on it's own well enough that I purchased the sound track.  The actors are well cast, with several actual Buddhist monks and a wandering ascetic portraying themselves in the film.  This is a very enjoyable film for children and adults, and one that can be enjoyed on a deeper level with anyone who has studied Buddhism, as there are visual references to tenets of the faith through out the movie.  This is a film that can simply be enjoyed for it's voluptuous story telling and performances; or as an exploration of a faith older than Christianity, and how it has shaped cultures.  It is filmed on location, in India and Seattle, and provides an entertaining glimpse of the possibilities that life can offer, even in the face of obstacles and uncertainty.",1322092800,28,1745,4.828859060402684

The inter-cut story of the life of Buddha and the search for a modern Lama reincarnation was very well done and it flowed very easily from one to the other, enhancing each storyline.

623178,1,6303269850,"Little Buddha must rank near the bottom for informative or entertaining movies about Buddha or Buddhism.  While the sets, costumes and cinematography of the period scenes are beautiful, the story is hopelessly muddled and sentimental, the Sunday-school version of the life of the Buddha preposterous.  Is anyone likely to believe that this effete Siddartha never saw an old or sick or dead person in his 28 years?  And that even if he hadn't, that such a person would, upon seeing such things, throw away a pampered existence to live in the forest with naked, starving, infested ascetics?

The modern tale with which it is paired, the search for a reincarnated lama, is equally unconvincing.  At a suburban American playground a young mother retrieving her son is chatted up by a Tibetan monk in burgundy robes.  Uninvited the monk is on her doorstep the next day, in the company of another monk, and both are asked in for tea, as if they were old friends just popping by to say hello.  If you didn't know any better, you might get the idea from this film that Americans are by nature so unsuspecting as to invite stalkers into their homes.  Later on, though the parents admit to some suspicion about the monk's motives, and though neither one expresses any interest in Buddhism, they drop their child off to be baby-sat with the monks at the local Buddhist center.

And when it isn't incredulous, the script is sometimes incomprehensible - the dialog leaves you to wonder if something hadn't been edited out.  The acting is stiffer than wood and the main characters simply annoying.  They're nothing like real people, just little puppets set up to keep the story moving.  The message of the film?  Have compassion for all living beings.  How can the average person achieve this?  Why is this a good thing?  Director Bernardo Bertolucci never gets around to it.

623228,1,6303269850,"The premise of the movie primarily addresses the historical perspective and fundamental principles of Buddahism, enlightenment and reincarnation.  The movie transitions between the historical Buddha and and the more modern day application.  The historical period reflects on the growth and development of a Prince (played by Keanu Reaves) who is searching for the meaning of life and ultimately develops and practices the precepts of Buddahism.  Prince Siddharta is Buddha.  The modern time period revolves around a Lama in pursuit of his recently deceased 'teacher' who has been reincarnated in three different children.  The majority of the modern time period is in America, where the Lama tries to persuade the parents (Chris Isaak and Jane Fonda) of a young boy that thier son is the reincarnated teacher.  While the theme has great possibilities, the movie is painstakingly slow, the dialogue is difficult to follow at times and many of the messages are obscurely presented.

623268,5,6303269850,"The film is a monument to the respect we owe both to life and death, compassion for both the living who are also the dying but respect to both death and life. The film is an extremely emotional film about the great spirituality Buddhism is. But it remains rather folkloric about Buddha's life and the middle way is an English translation that does not mean what the original words meant. Today in English it means the refusal to choose either one way or another and the fact that we are lacking the courage we need to face and assume both life and death because life is great and death is just as great, and life is bad and death is just as bad. Life leads to death through decay and pain. But life is also the promise of rebirth through karma and death. Death is bad because it is the result of decay and pain. But death is good too because it is the door to rebirth through karma and death itself. That's what the middle way means, not neither nor, but  both one and the other. There is some attachment, tanha in Pali, that has to be severed, to the middle way seen as an in-between and a non-commitment. You have to accept both sides of nature, the universe, existence, the beginning birth, the growing and decaying life, the ending death, and then if you believe in it the beyond of a new beginning in rebirth. The film is also by far too Tibetan. I am for the little chariot, the southern Asian Buddhism, not for the northern Asian Buddhism, and particularly not for Tibetan Buddhism. This last variety has replaced the non-commitment of Buddha to the existence of God, to the existence of a soul in man, a divine presence in that soul, and his commitment to the absolute absence of any permanence with a fetishized eternal not life but survival from one life to another. In other words nirvana does not exist anymore since for Buddha nirvana is the possibility to step out of the cycle birth-life-death-rebirth and the possibility to merge with the vast principle of universal existence. Nirvana has been emptied of its meaning and replaced by some kind of sainthood that peregrinates from one being to another. What's more the film insists too much on the rites and not on the social dimension of Buddhism. And this shows a social dimension that I had not found in the Buddhist temple I have visited and worked for. They do not teach to monks only but they have a teaching mission for everyone. They do not take care of the health of monks only but they heal and cure everyone. They do not help the members of the monastic community only, closed onto themselves as they appeared to be, but they help everyone in the community at large of which they are full members. In other words this film does not really give an image of the deep spirituality of Buddhism, the search not for one self because the self cannot exist since it is impermanent like anything else, but for the light that is hidden in the very middle of things. That's the best part of Buddhism, the meditation that enables you, through a slow and long learning process in which you have to be both guided and free, to dominate your feelings, your passions, your sentiments, your cravings too, without rejecting anything but by finding the just equilibrium that will enable you to enjoy beauty as much as not to be the slave of that beauty, for one example. Yes a Buddhist can enjoy music or flowers but a Buddhist will not become attached to these and forget that he has many responsibilities to himself, to his direct community, family or other, to the social community beyond and even to the world and the universe. The Buddhists I know are able to love other people and to feel and express deep feelings and yet to remain detached enough to be able to help the friend they love with the distantiation they and he or she need to find pleasure and control pain. That is the middle way too: enjoy the pleasure that will not bring pain and control the pain that may destroy the pleasure. To control does not mean to get rid of because it is impossible, to be indifferent because it is uncompassionate, inhuman, but to keep within some limits that will enable you to remain the main agent of your own life in symbiosis with those of your living companions.

623270,4,6303269850,"Some reviewers have come away from this film with the impression that it is an instructional film, letting English speaking audiences become aware of the basic story of the enlightenment of Prince Siddharta. Other reviewers have focused on the Seattle family which is transported out of their previous existance and culture into the possibility that their young son is a reincarnation of a holy LLama. Whereas I think this film does both of these story lines justice, I think there is a third story line in the film which is just as strong. This story is the quest by Llama Norbu for the reincarnation(s) of his teacher, then the death of Llama Norbu after his mission is accomplished, and finally the very moving spritual ceremonies at the end of the film where the monks mourn for Llama Norbu and the three children spread the ashes of Llama Norbu in Bhutan, India, and Seattle Washington.

Bartolucci gives us first a story line that Western audiences can accept; a white upper class American family is moved from their everyday existance to another culture and belief system by a group of gentle Tibetian monks. Within this story line is a child's version of the story of Prince Siddharta, played by Keanu Reeves, relating the origins of the Buddha. However, cleverly hidden amongst these parts is the quest of Llama Norbu, played to perfection by the wonderful Ying Ruocheng.

623273,5,6303269850,"At first sight, this may look like a movie about reincarnation, far from our bed. No! It is an excellent explanation of how Buddhism can be ""the answer"", also to people in the West. We see a Tibetan monk looking for the reincarnation of his master who died 8 years ago. He seems to find the reincarnated old monk in the form of 8-year old Jesse, a typical American kid. Now,  Jesse's typical American family thinks that Buddhism is weird, ""what have we got to do with that?"", and they kind of want to ignore the Tibetan monk. The Americans have their own life, no place for Buddhism there. Then all kinds of things start happening in the Americans' lives: the man's partner goes bankrupt, he later kills himself, etc. That is when, suddenly, the American man sees that in his way of life, he has no way of dealing with these things, and that Buddhism on the other hand is exactly talking about these things that happen in everybody's lives: loss, change, suffering, death and how to deal with them. That is where the 2 story lines beautifully merge into one story: the Westerners see that Buddhism talks about their life in Seattle as much as about life in the Himalayas. The old monk can now safely die, his mission accomplished. In fact at that point in the movie the 2 stories also merge with the third story line, the re-telling of the life of the historical Buddha. Thus, the life of Buddha, the crisis in the life of the Western people, and the story of the Tibetan monks and their search for meaning, all become one. One. The last scene of the movie says it all: the American child (wise like a little Buddha), floats the Tibetan monk's ashes on the river in Seattle, WA. His mother is looking on, smiling, pregnant with a new baby. Another little buddha on the way. Hmmm, didn't the old monk just die? ...",1159488000,,1813,4.460843373493976

623351,5,6303269850,"The storyline is excellent, switching between the ancient story of Siddhartha and the story of the modern world's struggle in opening the mind and hearts to alternative spiritual teaching flawlessly.  I watched this movie when I was a teenager with English as my second language.  Maybe it was my age back then, maybe it was the fact I was not fluent in English ... Maybe I was not brought up as learning the teachings of Buddhism.  I was attracted to the movie but couldn't get much out of it.  I think what was truly missing back then for me was that I did not have a spiritual teacher to guide me through the background of Buddhism.

Now, as a grown-up, as I continue learning and expanding my interest and knowledge about spirituality (including Buddhism), I found this movie's storyline is beautifully weaved to allow the Western World see the ancient wisdom the Tibet Buddhism is trying to tell us.  This movie is an extremely brief introduction of the whole new spiritual world.

Although I have to admit Keanu Reeves has the facial feature of Siddhartha compare to other Hollywood stars, I was a little disappointed at Keanu Reeves' acting in this movie.  I couldn't really feel Siddhartha's spirit in this actor.  Siddhartha was in a mission to learn about suffering and helping us see the illusions we create in the world .... In search of the truth about the Universe.  But personally, I couldn't really see it in the eyes of this particular actor.  But I guess Siddhartha's life is probably one of the hardest to act on ... For, one has to have a deep understanding about Siddhartha's quest to free human beings from suffering ... which not many of us can truly understand that with our hearts.

Buddhism is certainly not the only road to Enlightenment ... (Well, why are we on the road by the way if the teachings are about being fully in the present moment anyway, learning about the laws of impermanence and non-judgment?) But this movie certainly opened an alternative door for each of us learning about compassion and love to ourselves, others and the Universe.  This movie is brief ... If your heart is intrigued to learn more about this religion, go with your heart.  The United States is very much dominated by Christianity ... Yet, I hold the belief that Christianity is not the only truth.  It is the 21st century now.  Let us move forward and open our minds to different spiritual teachings before we shut any doors down ... Don't let judgment and prejudice impair our full ability to learn and value religious differences.  Let our hearts decide which belief system we choose to adopt as an adult.

623353,5,6303269850,"Do you believe in reincarnation? This is the question that must ultimately be answered by a young American family when a group of crimson robed Tibetan monks unexpectedly appear on the front porch of their upper-class Seattle residence. Dean and Lisa Conrad (Chris Isaak and Bridget Fonda), the parents of a bright, inquistive boy named Jesse (Alex Wiesendanger) are faced with the possibility that their son may be the reincarnated soul of a revered Tibetan Lama. At least that's what they've been told by this group of monks recently relocated to downtown Seattle.

Just before leaving Lama Norbu (Ying Ruocheng) presents Jesse with a gift, a book on the life of Siddhartha. In the days following this initial encounter with the religious leader of the Tibetan community Jesse begins to read about the life and deeds of the young Prince who would one day become the Buddha.

From that point on the film shifts back and forth between the interaction of the Tibetan monks with the Conrad family in modern day America and the retelling of Siddhartha's (Keanu Reeves) life and journey to enlightenment in ancient India. This movement is flawlessly done by director Bernardo Bertolucci, adding depth and meaning to the rapidly changing events taking place in the life of little Jesse Conrad.

An excellent movie on every level. Intelligent storyline, incredibly beautiful cinematography provided by Vittorio Storaro and overall good performances, especially by the Tibetans and Kanika Pandey as Queen Maya.

I liked it, and  - since I saw it on television first - got through about half the movie before I recognized Keanu Reeves.  I saw it first on television in Malaysia.  To give you a thumbnail of the values system in a moderate Muslim country: Deep Blue, the shark movie, was run ""full blooded"" on television marked as ""suitable for all family members.""  This movie was run with a ""Parental guidance - some ideas may be unsuitable for some family members."" disclaimer.  No kidding.",1116892800,6,682,4.408
623356,5,6303269850,"I have seen this movie several times and it's on my list of DVD's to purchase for my collection.

 I thought that the interweaving of the story about 3 children who are candidates as the reincarnation of a Tibetan Lama (Lama Dorje ), with the Story of the Life of the Buddha was an interesting approach which I thought was executed successfully.

 I also thought that the acting was very well done overall. On my first viewing, I would have agreed with other reviewers, that Chris Isaak seemed very ""Detached"" and it at first put me off. On further viewings however, I actually could see the subtle metamorphosis of his character.

  He is an engineer who is not only skeptical about the whole idea of his son being a possible reincarnation of a Tibetan Lama, but is also struggling with intense personal stress due to the bankruptcy and then death of his business partner. Looked at in that light I thought he portrayed the character believably.

  What's important to note is that as the movie moves on he warms up considerably to and has a deepening connection with Lama Norbu (whose character,is the central Tibetan Monk in the story, he is the one who is searching for his deceased teacher's reincarnation).

  He (Issak's Character) most definitely appears to start to appreciate the Tibetan Buddhist ideas as well. In fact in a subtle way he seems to start to heal from all the recent turmoil in his own life from his interactions with Lama Norbu and the other Tibetan Buddhist monks.

  I give this story five stars on many accounts. First, I love the story and the courage the director had to make a major film about something like this. Second, I thought the cinematography was beautifully done. Third, I personally thought that overall the acting was well done and that Keanu Reeves did a good job overall as the Buddha. In addition all the other actors, both the adults and children, came across very naturally in their roles.

 The actor, Ruocheng Ying, who plays Lama Norbu in Particular was outstanding as well as all the Tibetan actors, many who I believe are real monks (Sogyal Rinpoche for certain is not only a real Tibetan Monk but the author of ""The Tibetan Book Of Living and Dying"".

 Anyway, if this topic interests you, if you like movies like Kundun or Seven Years in Tibet, you will most likely enjoy this. If you are someone who has no exposure to Buddhism this is an enjoyable way to get a very basic idea of some of it's beliefs. Of course the Buddha's ""life story"" as portrayed in this movie definitely isn't meant to be a literal historical portrayal (particularly about his birth, with him walking and talking as a newborn).

  Still, concerning the Buddha, his teachings are what matters and not the ""cult of personality"". The Buddha tried very hard to instill in his disciples that his teaching was key and that he was not to be the focus of their practice, he was an example of how to live and practice, not someone to be prayed to.

623357,4,6303269850,"Little Buddha is really two stories that are intertwined. The main part of the story is about a little boy named Jesse who lives in Seattle with his parents. Buddhist monks believe that he may be the reincarnation of their late teacher. They came to his house and present him with a book about Prince Siddharta.

As the movie progresses, there are flashbacks as the book is read to Jesse. It tells the story movie of Prince Siddharta and his journey to enlightenment. Siddharta is played by Keanu Reeves. Try as I might, I had a hard time recognizing Keanu. He was lost in his role -- only to be recognized by his eyes. In this role, he shines.

Most of Jesse's story takes place overseas in Bhutan, where he meets the other two children that also may be reincarnations of Llam Dorje. Prince Siddharta's story continues to be intertwined with Jesse's story.

623359,5,6303269850,"Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Little Buddha"" brings a modernity to the ancient story of Prince Siddhartha, who became the Buddha. ""Siddhartha"", by Hermann Hesse, is one of my favorite books so I was delighted to see the story reincarnated in film, especially by so adept a director as Bertolucci. The cinematography is absolutely captivating and by the time the film has run its course the watcher will feel as though he has actually visited these ancient lands.

Woven throughout is the vital Buddhist philosophy that by remaining open and honest in our lives and pursuits, by exercising those childlike qualities, while standing inside ourselves, we will find that the most challenging and rewarding activity is to simply just be.

My belief is that this tale is very adaptable and relative to most everyone, in the context that the Buddhists advocate moderation in life, or ""the middle way."" In this fast-paced society, we all too often find ourselves going to extremes or allowing ourselves to become obsessed with certain behaviors, ideas, people, etc. When I finished this movie I felt a beautiful sense of calm. It is transcendent and revealing and touches not only the human spirit, but our human nature, of which we are not always proud.",1094083200,5,1239,5.0390243902439025

623382,2,6303269850,"It seems to me that this movie was rushed through production. I feel that this movie could have gone deeper into the truth of Buddism and not lingered on the top of it. I don't understand how the parents of the little boy would just leave him with perfect strangers or let him run off by himself in Bhutan. There seemed to be no point with the fact that the fathers freind died, except that it showed connection between Siddhartha and the boy. In the end of the movie, I didn't understand how the kids ended up watching Siddhartha be temtped under the Bo tree and reach enlightenment. While many of the things shown about Buddism were true, they forgot some main ideas such as the four noble truths and the eight fold path.
 In all, I feel this movie could have been taken more time on in the making and resulted in a pathetic movie that stretches the reality of our lives",1066521600,8,872,4.3496932515337425

623385,3,6303269850,"Yes, aesthetically this is a well-crafted film. Yes, it's only a film, and it was entertaining to watch. And I absolutely understand why someone might completely adore this movie. But I think there is a real validity to some of the criticism made by other reviewers in regards to this film. I don't think these individuals are somehow phony Buddhists... and it would be rather hypocritical to take a 'Holier than Thou' approach, isn't it? (Or should I say, 'More Buddhist than Thou'?).
What I mean to say is that criticisms of this film are valid, thought provoking, and allow viewers to enjoy/understand the implications of this film on an entirely new level. Here are some additional quotes, of people that said things much better than I could. I don't necessarily hold steadfast to all these views, but they are utterly thought provoking, and completely relevant:
""The promise of film has been transformed into an astheticized folklore of phanatasmagorized exchange""
-Anita Hill
""Such tales are the architectonic machinery of the culture industry and have transcended their subject matter. They have fallen into the fetishistic apparatus of representation""
-J. Wong-Wylie
Its also interesting to look at what authors Yasmeen Abu Laban and Christina Gabriel describe as ""selling diversity"":
""a selling of diversity, whereby the skills, talents, and ethnic backgrounds of men and women are commodified, marketed, and billed as trade enhancing. In this context, certain notions of ?diversity?...are viewed favourable, both at home in Canada and globally""
The film 'Little Buddha' offers us a fantastic opportunity to think about this commodification of culture, identity and religion, as well as its simultaneous exoticization. There's nothing inherently wrong about our tendency of consuming the exotic. There's nothing inherently wrong about this film either. As others and I have said, it?s just a movie. But I think what's important is the absence of alternative to the exoticized pageantry ""Little Buddha"" offers.

And a comment about the film itself: I think what disappointed me about this film is that it felt hollow and a little two dimensional for my tastes. It left me wanting more; more story (outside the Lord Budda narrative), more depth, and stronger characters that I would have time to develop an attachment for. But, perhaps, that says more about me as a viewer than it says about the film itself. Anyhow, take a chance to see this movie, its not a complete and utter failure, its just a bit boring in terms of character development and storyline.
Also, I found Alex Udvary's review (June 27, 2000) of the film to be very helpful and insightful.",1052870400,8,2663,5.135944700460829

With that firmly in mind,it is hard not to enjoy the lush cinematography, and the interesting story about how the Dalai Lama comes back through reincarnation. In this particular situation, three young children are thought to be separate but integral reincarnations of the Dalai Lama. As the story progresses, the life of Siddharta (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) is simplistically revealed prior to his becoming Buddha, and his awakening into Buddha. I like the fact that the movie did not make any attempts to proselytize Buddhism, but instead revealed some of its beliefs and practices. The movie is very entertaining and absorbing; a dream-like fantasy.",1040601600,2,695,5.214285714285714
623388,5,6303269850,"As a traditional Jew who is often critical of films about Judaism, I can understand why some Buddhist reviewers have disparaged ""Little Buddha"" as overly-simplistic.  For a lifelong practitioner of Buddhism, it probably is.  Then again, people have to start somewhere.  Those of us who seriously practice a spiritual path - whatever it may be -- tend to forget that intro level materials are just that -- basic intro.  While the average Buddhist might already know the story of Buddha's life by heart, the vast majority of non-Buddhists here in the USA do not.  Also keep in mind that this is a PG family film, not an historical documentary.  My impression was that the film was primarily aimed at children, since the main characters is a little boy, and the story-within-the-story about Buddha's life is presented as a series of scenes in a book he (the American kid) is reading.  Granted, the film does have an certain idealized, fairytale quality, but then again, so do the all those sand-and-sandals films about Jesus.  Which is why I would place ""Little Buddha"" in the same genre.  I happen to like this kind of pagentry, so I enjoyed ""little Buddha"" for the icongraphy that it is.
On the technical end, the cinamatography is beautiful, the costumes are superb, and the acting is well done.  The story, while fictional, is based on real cases of Tibetan Lamas who have reincarnated in the West.  As a companion to this film, I would recommend Vickie McKenzie's book, ""Reborn in the West,"" which chronicles several such real-life cases.  In fact, it was after reading McKenzie's book that I noticed this film and decided to view it.",1037664000,137,1636,4.82437275985663

But further more I think that one should simply try to derive the message that the movie may offer about Eastern views on spirituality.  Im not a Buddhist, but I do think that people should view such films in a certain disspassionate way, without any biases against certain religious faiths.
Therefore I do find this film a great film, not because the outstanding cinematography, but because of the sprit and essence of the east that it encapsulates.  I also think that Keanu Reeves done a superb job in playing Lord Buddah.  In an interview for the making of the Matrix, he indeed quoted that:""Working on Little Buddah definately had an dramatic effect on my outlook towards life"".
I found this an extreemly enjoyable film to watch, and I highly recomend it to all those out there who not only enjoy films in the genre, but also simply like to watch ""good films"".",1036108800,5,1028,4.626373626373627

I thought that the information that was given was helpful even though at times hard to follow. I think its definetly one of those ""watch twice"" movies.  All the story lines were too confusing to understand.  I finally fiugred out how to follow the movie.
The acting was surprisingly very good.  The ""chosen "" children were exceptionally great actors for their particular age.  I also thought that the foreign poeple in the movie were good actors.  They really made the movie have a  more realistic value. They made the movie different from other  Kong Fu movies featuring foreigners that you can't understand a thing they are saying.  These actors had a good English background as well as a Buddhist background.
The music was very realistic as well, and it made the movie come together.  Although, in some parts I think there was room for improvement, the whole production was truly helpful and interesting.  I cannot say I would have gone to rent or to purchase this movie myself, but as a class activity and since we are studying this subject, I really did not mind at all.
My favorite part would have had been at the end when the ""chosen"" children let the ashes go.  I thought it was interesting to see each child distribute the ashes in their own way.  It was neat how the little girl lets hers go at the top of the tree with all the monkeys.  It reminded me of ""The Lion King""!
Overall, I think the movie was a great production.  I would recommend anyone to watch this movie if they are studying Buddhism.  It will help you to understand how different religions can be.  Our religion will really seem quite different after viewing this movie.  I have a much better idea of how things looked at those times and the rules and regulations put on a certain person.",1009324800,4,1913,4.54093567251462
623444,3,6303269850,"Little Buddha is a very religiously informative film.  It takes place in both modern day Seattle and Katmandu, and also in ancient India.

Lama Norbu believes his former teacher has been reincarnated into Jesse and travels to Seattle to find him.  Norbu locates Jesse and begins to teach him about Buddhism and Siddhartha the first Buddha.

623445,4,6303269850,"I liked this movie.  It was very interesting and helped me to understand Buddhism and Indian way of life.  It, also, showed the importance of reincarnation in the Buddhist tradition.
 Culturally, I learned how Tibetans lived; noble groups wore sandals on their feet and almost all of the rest were barefooted.  Nobles dressed in highly colorful creations.  The women had long dresses that went down to their feet. The men wore brightly colored clothing as well.  Most of them, however, had long, red robes around their clothes.  It really completed the movie.  I liked the clothes a lot.
 A monk, from Tibet, Lama Norbu recieves a letter that tells him his former teacher's reincarnation may have been found.  He goes to Seattle, where he meets another monk that has had dreams about a hill and goes there over and over again.  They leave to find this hill, and find out that a house is there and there is a family of only one child living there.
 A Seattle school teacher found out that her son may be the reincarnation of Lama Norbu.  Lama Norbu is there telling her about this Lama Dorje.  While there, her husband comes home to find them in the living room.  He doesn't like this too much.  He doesn't want his son Jesse to have anything to do with this.  They leave Jesse a book about Buddha.  He learns everything about Siddhartha who becomes the Buddha.  In the retelling, his mother gave birth to him and she found out that he was extremely special.  Right after he was born, he could walk and behind every footstep there blossomed a flower.
 When Siddhartha was older, he finally figured out that he wanted to see the world with his own eyes.  His father doesn't want him to leave, but Siddhartha did any way.  The night before his big adventure, he visited his wife and newborn baby.  He looked at them and kissed them goodbye.
 On his way out of the village, he noticed two very old men.  He couldn't believe his eyes.  He had never seen anything so horrible before.  He walked into a place that was horrible.  It had slaves working and people dying.  He didn't know about sickness or death.  He wants to do something that will help the suffering of people and goes off to reflect on this problem.
  Meanwhile, Jesse and his father go to Bhutan.  While on the plane, Jesse learns even more about Siddhartha.  He also finds out that two other children, Raju and Gita, could be the reincarnation.  Lama Norbu goes to the Oracle to find out which one is the real reincarnation because he is confused.  You will have to watch the rest of the movie to find out the end.
 I think that the movie was pretty accurate.  It showed how the Tibetans practiced their religon and the way they lived.  I liked the music. It was different types of instruments put together by one rhythm.  A woman would sing, but it sounded like she was awwing.  It kept you into the movie.
 This was a well planned and well-written movie.  A lot of thought was also put into this movie.  It wasn't a really emotional movie.  The movie leaves you on the edge of your seat because you always want to know what is going to happen next.  The scenery in Seattle was done in cool colors.  It showed a kind of gloomy feeling.  In contrast, the flashbacks and stories were done in warm colors.  It really made you spend more attention to it.
 The acting was great.  The children did an especially great job.  Every actor did a wonderful job.  Jesse's mother didn't want him to go without her for a week or more, but since he was with his father, she let him go, like most mothers today.  I also think that the costumes were well created.  It really looked like something the Tibetans would wear.  The costumes of the Tibetan people had lots of warm colors, but the Seattle people had norml outfits, like we would wear, but in cool colors.

Little Buddha is both an enjoyable and educational movie.  This movie has two story lines.  One is about the quest of a group of monks, to seek out the reincarnated spirit of a great Buddhist teacher, Lama Dorje.  And the other is a retelling of the story of Siddhartha, and how, having reached enlightenment, becomes the Buddha.

 During the first plot line, Lama Norbu comes to Seattle in search of the reincarnation of his dead teacher, Lama Dorje.  His search leads him to young Jesse Conrad, Raju, a boy from Katmandu, and an Indian girl.  Together, they journey to Bhutan where the three children must undergo a test to prove which is the true reincarnation.  After finding his teacher the monk then meditates and dies.
 The second story is about Siddhartha and how he became the Buddha.  It traces his spiritual journey from ignorance to true enlightenment.  Young Siddhartha lived a carefree life in the palace.  His father, Kind Suddhodana, is shielding him from all unpleasantness such as elderly, sick or dying people.  Gradually however, Siddhartha begins to get curious about the world out there, and one day sneaks outside the palace gate.  Siddhartha comes in contact with suffering, desires, and death.  This movie really opens your eyes to the basic concepts of Buddhism and the theme of reincarnation.
 I really liked the costumes and scenery in this movie, because they cam across well along with the theme.  The music also added that extra effect needed to keep your attention throughout the movie.  There was extremely good acting in this movie, especially by the children.  Although this movie was well-written and well thought out, there was no emotional depth or appeal.  The running time on this movie is also a little too long, which is not aided by the ragged transitions.  And the characters never really connect with the audience, so the viewer's attention span is greatly tested.  But overall I really enjoyed this movie and the themes it presents.",1006387200,11,2060,4.976539589442815
623448,4,6303269850,"""Little Buddha"" is a very interesting, educational, and well-made movie.  It's not the best movie I have ever seen, but I can tell you that I thouroughly enjoyed it.

The story begins in modern-day Tibet.  A monk, Lama Norbu, receives a letter telling him that the reincarnation of his former teacher may have been found.  He goes to Seattle to pursure this great news, and another monk tells him that he had dreams that their old teacher led him to the same empty spot on a hill over and over again.  One day, the  monk came across teh very spot from his dream and finds a house there.  A family with an only child lives there and the  monks believe that Jesse, the child, is their teacher reincarnated.  The monks visit Jesse and his mother at home and leave Jesse a book about Buddha.
Later, Jesse asks the monks about their teacher and takes them to the Seattle Fine Arts Museum to see a sculpture of Buddha.  Jesse's mother takes him to the Dharma Center to visit the monk, where they continue to read to Jesse the story of how Siddhartha became the Buddha.
Jesse's father arrives to talk to the monks and calls the story of Buddha a myth and while he has plenty of respect for the Tibetan culture and religion he does not believe in reincarnation.  The monks explains reincarnation to Jesse's father by breaking a cup full of tea.  He says that the tea is still tea even when it's on the floor in in a rag.  He says the mind and spirit are the same way after death.  He goes on to mention that if Jesse goes to Nepal with the monks that he could be a powerful figure in Tibetan culture.  Irritated, Jesse's father says it's gone too far, takes his son, and leaves.
He then gets a call on his cell phone and finds out that Evan, his business partner, died unexpectedly, causing Jesse's father a great deal of pain.  Father and son stop to look over a bridge and watch the cars drive past, symbolizing life passing by.  Jesse's father tells Jesse's  mother that he has had a change of heart  and that he thinks Jesse should go to Bhutan.
On the plane the monks explain more of Siddhartha's story.  As it turns out, there are 2 more candidates for the reincarnated teacher, Raju and and girl named Gita.  Lama Norbu goes to the Oracle to find out which child is really the teacher, because he is confused about it.  I won't tell you what happens, but when Lama Norbu has a decision, he is at peace with himself and tells Jesse's father that his time is done.
Throughout the modern setting, there is a totally different plot going on, the retelling of how Siddhartha became the Buddha, which is always done in a flashback format.
Aside from both great stories that were told, ""Little Buddha"" is a very well-made movie.  All of the present-day scenes from Seattle are done in very cool colors, almost making it seem like you are looking through blue glasses.  In the present-day scenes from Nepal and the flash-backs to the story of Buddha, every thing is warm and done in oranges and reds.  The costuming was excellent and communicated very well what people really wore in the time of Siddhartha and what peoploe wear in modern times also.  I think that the actors were very well fitted for their roles and veryone involved in making this movie did a good job.",1005696000,18,3262,4.440336134453782

I think the director chose blue to portray Seattle as gloomy, cold and uninviting.  Then when ever they were looking back into the time of Buddha the colors were very vivid and had a redish tint.  I belive they were trying to portray Budhism as warm and inviting.
The juxstaposition was very good.  I think it really helped you to get the meaning of Little Buddha, with the scenes switching back and forth from the present to the ancient past.  I also liked the costumes very much.  I think the costumes really help you get an idea of how life was like in the times of Buddha.  I also think Keanu Reeves  was the perfect actor  to play Siddhartha.
I really enjoyed the movie Little Buddha, it helped me get a very good understanding of what Buddhism is all about.",1005177600,,939,4.339080459770115

It is probably difficult  to tell others about your religion and for them to take you seriously.  However, in these circumstances, Jesse's family seems very open-minded and takes everything into consideration.
  The monk, Norbu tells Jesse the story of Siddhartha in a flashback format.  Jesse's father tells the monk that he and his wife don't believe in reincarnation.  The monk doesn't seem discouraged at all and explains to him that ""tea"" is the same whether it is in a cup, on the floor, or in a rag that absorbs it.  Jesse's family and the monk have a few more encounters, and he invites them to Tibet.  Jesse's father having had a deep personal crisis himself, thinks that it would be a great opportunity.  So, Jesse and his dad depart for Tibet with the monk to see whether the young boy is the reincarnation of his former teacher.
  While in Tibet, Jesse meets other kids his age.  They quickly develop a great friendship.  These are other children who might be the spirit of Lama Dorje.  It turns out that each of these kids are Lama Dorje.  One of them does not exist without the other and they all feel a compassion for all beings.
  After a moving experience in Tibet, Jesse and his father return to their home in Seattle.  They share their understanding of Buddhism with Jesse's mother.  They spread the ashes of Lama Norbu at sea.  Their family learned a lot about his culture and it seemed ot open doors in their life.
  I think this movie provided a great introduction into the life of the spirit in Buddhism.  It showed a true representation fo Buddhism  The special effects of the movie were great.  The background colors emphasized the different feelings throughout the movie.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.  It is an enlightening film that I believe everyone can get somthing out of.",1005177600,,1986,4.658959537572255
623451,4,6303269850,"This is the story of Siddartha. This is the story of Buddha.
Siddartha was born on 2 legs - that is, he could already walk. He could also already talk, and was born with very little pain, or so the legend goes. His father, the king, was very proud of his son. At Siddartha's birthday celebration, an old man who had not been seen in the village for something like 9 years appeared and prophesied that Siddartha would become a great teacher. His father became worried and decided that his son would become a prince, not a teacher. He watched Siddartha grow into fruition and made sure that he would not have any desire to leave the temple. This, however, was not his destiny. Siddartha traveled beyond the walls of safety and peace. He saw death and disease, suffering and loss. It was not difficult for him to make his decision to leave royalty. From here he begins his journey toward nirvana, towards become the Buddha, ""the enlightened one.""
 As this story is being told, another is unwinding. A Tibetan monk by the name of Llama Norbu is seeking the reincarnated form of his teacher. There are three possible ""candidates"" for the reincarnation. 1 of them is a little boy named Jesse, who lives in Seattle. He goes to Butan and meets the other 2 candidates. A boy about Jesse's age, and a ... girl? Yes, the possibility exists that Llama Norbu's teacher (who was a man) could have been reincarnated as a female. Who it turns out to be I will not say. You're going to have to watch it yourself. You'll be surprised in the end, though.
 I was satisfied with the ending of the movie - actually, I liked the whole thing. The color choices were interesting. All of the Seattle scenes had a very blue tint to them, and none of the lights in the house were on. On the contrary, all the Tibet scenes (and the Siddartha story) are shown with bright colors and intricate costumes. Many full reds and oranges were used to heighten the sense of power and vibrancy. Also, the story line itself: that was pretty good. I liked the tale of Siddartha's journey to find awakening. The part where He does battle with Mara, god of evil, death, etc. is really cool. I think that it even had a sort of educational ring to it. While educational films may not be the best thing to get someone excited, it is still a good movie, and you should see it if you can.",1005177600,,2339,4.424593967517401
623452,5,6303269850,"As a follower of Tibetan Buddhism, I was so thrilled to find a movie that presents the traditional story of the Buddha's life while also giving a realistic portrayal of modern Tibetan Buddhism.  I think a lot of the reviewers have missed the point of this movie - it is essentially religious, not a creative fiction to be analyzed on story elements.
The portrayal of the Buddha's life was very accurate to the Buddhist accounts and very well done - I was especially pleased to see how authentically Indian the scenes were.  The modern story may have seemed far-fetched to some, but the account of the monks' search for their reincarnated teacher was accurate and I especially liked how realistic the Tibetan monks were.  The visuals from Nepal (particularly the Bodhnath stupa) and Bhutan were truly breathtaking.  This is a very fine movie and I look forward to showing it to my children some day.",996105600,7,898,4.774193548387097

Siddharta's biography is only approximated, with plenty of details glossed over, such as his meditative confrontation of all his past lives, the very path to his enlightenment.  This particular moment in the movie is a major disappointment.

When it comes to the Spiritual Path of Enlightenment, I found this movie more than adequate to fulfill that mission.  It's not a point of whether or not it was well directed or well acted (which I believe that it was), it's a point of being able to recognize spiritual depth within a work of art.

623515,3,6303269850,"This is one of the few rewarding statements I can make about this film. This is a great shock to me considering I normally love Bertolucci's work. A lot of people compare this film to Bertolucci's earlier masterpiece ""The Last Emperor"". I will try not to compare the two but rather try to judge the movie on it's own merit. First lets talk about the story. It did definitely have possibilities. But was only mildly done. This could of been another ""Last Emperor""! It just seemed to move to slow and doesn't carry any ""heart"" with it. You don't care about the movie. You wonder why was it made in the first place. What is Bertolucci trying to tell us? Next is the acting. Everyone seems mediocre at best. Not one person stands out. Keanu Reeves,Bridget Fonda,Chris Isaak,Alex Wiesendanger,and many others are all mildly used here. Not one enjoyable performance except for,believe it or not....Ruocheng Ying! I know what your all thinking. Is this kid crazy! Who is that! But believe me,he's the only character who manages to carry your interest through out the film. Now for the directing. Bernardo is a one of a kind film maker,well maybe not exactly,see I always like to compare him with Stanley Kubrick. Here's why, each filmmaker manages to always transport you to another place in their films. They each create new ""worlds"". Watch Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""200l:A Space Odyssey"" then compare it to Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor"" or ""The Conformist"" or even this film. They each take us someplace new. Which is why I like Bertolucci's directing in this film. Everything is setup perfectly ONLY the actors ruin everything lol. If Bertolucci's directing weren't enough we have beautiful camerawork by Vittorio Storraro,who's work is always well done. Rounding out everything is the lush scenery. I would of never guessed that Bhutam and Nepal were such beautiful places. This is a must for Bertolucci fans. For the rest of you,watch with a cautious eye. You may be in for a disappointment.",962064000,3,2000,4.885294117647059
623516,5,6303269850,"Is something missing from your life that you can not explain?  Are you a soul-searcher?  If yes, great; if not, would you like to try?  Then this is the movie for you!
""Little Buddha"" is in a class by itself.  It  is most likened to a work of art.  Allow me to use  Da Vinchi's ""Mona  Lisa"" as an example.  You get a different impression every time you  look at her!  The same is true with this movie; the second (and subsequent  viewings) are better than the first!
Your faith is not a barrier to your  enjoyment of this movie.  This is a timeless, universal masterpiece by the  Academy Award-Winning director, Bernardo Bertolucci.  Please watch this  movie when you are not rushed, preferably alone; then relax and take, no  breathe it in.
Keanu Reeves proves he is a gifted and dedicated actor  as Prince Siddhartha, Buddha, the enlightened one.  This is a prodigious  story of his journey to enlightenment. Secondly it is also a story of the  search by Lama Norbu (Ying Ruocheng) for his teacher's reincarnation.  Here  is where the children fit in and they do a splendid job, especially Jesse  (Alex Wiesendanger.)  Chris Isaak plays his unbelieving father.  Bridget  Fonda acts with grace and elegance as the mother of Jesse.  To top off the  great acting by everyone, the special effects are astounding! You are in  for some amazing surprises; you will be impressed!  Furthermore, the  striking cinematography and music is a work of art in its own right!
Buy  ""Little Buddha"" and watch it from time to time when you need a  fresh outlook on your life.  Just like the ""Mona Lisa"" you will  discover something new every time.  You will not regret seeing this movie;  trust me!
Siddhartha says: ""To learn is to change.  The path to  enlightenment is in the middle way; it is the line between all opposite  extremes.""
A wise old musician speaking to his pupil passes by  Siddhartha who overhears: ""If you tighten the string too much it will  snap; and if you leave it too slack, it won't play."" Try this movie  out on your heartstrings.  Enjoy.",959817600,16,2047,4.623595505617978

623518,5,6303269850,"It may be that all religions are, at their heart, anti-aesthetic; after all, how does one achieve non-attachment if one is infatuated with expressions of beauty?  Be the answer what it may, one can trust that a  consumate operaticist like Bernardo Bertolucci would find occasion for a  visual orgy in portraying the life of the Buddha, as well as managing to  deeply stir his audience's emotions.  ""Little Buddha"" is perhaps  the most extremely stylized film yet from the history-making collaboration  of Bertolucci and cinematographer Vittorio Storraro; contemporary Seattle  lies in a sea of steely, at times deathly, blues;  while Bhutan is awash in  rapturous golds and reds.  In particular, Bertolucci reaches an apex of  grandeur in his treatment of the life of the Buddha himself:  the great  seeker of enlightenment answers our hopes of heroic achievement that were  left unfulfilled by the anti-hero Pu Yi in ""The Last Emperor.""  In this sense, Bertolucci perhaps ""Westernizes"" the Buddha; but  the director works like a Baroque painter, with a demand for conflict and  sweep.  His gamble is justified by the extraordinary aesthetic results;  ""Little Buddha"" is at once an accessible children's picture and a  profound treatment of spiritual mysteries.  The film is both idiosyncratic  and epic-- a near-impossible fusion of the personal and popular, and one of  the cinema's most exhilarating efforts.",957657600,2,1411,5.3090909090909095
623519,4,6303269850,"This movie has some very good points and some not so good.
First, the good: Keanu Reeves did a very good job as Siddhartha, and contrary to what one reviewer wrote below, Reeves is half-white and half-Asian (his father  is Chinese/Hawaiian).  Regardless of Reeves' racial/ethnic stock, he did a  wonderful job in this movie.  Actually the half of the movie about the life  of Siddharta was fascinating and magnificently filmed.  I wish the whole  movie were about his life and not the silly search.  The music soundtrack  by Ryuichi Sakamoto was also superb.
Now for the bad: the half of the  movie searching for the young Buddha was silly and the acting was poor by  the parents of the boy.  It did not ring true and was uninteresting.  A  whole movie about Siddhartha's life would have been much better.
That  said, the half of the movie with Reeves is worth seeing and savoring, while  the other half can be fast-forwarded.",954028800,9,926,4.69375

7843286,3,6303269850,"They changed the script from Buddha being born in India to him being born in Nepal. At the time of the Buddha there was no Nepal. He was born in a place just about 10-15 miles north of the border in the Terai region of north India given over to Nepal by the British. He was born in the north Indian kingdom of Kapilavistu which had a totally different map. Part of it was situated in todays India and part of it in Nepal of today. The reason historians believe in the current location is due to an Ashokan pillar. If Ashoka erected his pillar there then that means that was India then. We do not hear anything about Nepal in any historical document of that time nor those a thousand years later. The neighboring country to the west of India has a stone inscription from 560 BC calling India with the name from which the word India comes from. That word is Hind which is derived from Sind. Also, the Buddha clearly states that he is from Jambudvipa, which is the traditional Buddhist word for India. The Buddha was an Indo-Aryan and his lineage was the solar line, and his caste was that of a Kshatriya. The information in this movie is clearly wrong. However, if we were to completely ignore the information from the original sutras, then we might as well not believe that he even existed or did any of the other things associated with him. Furthermore, the majority of the Nepalese living in the Terai region are of Indo-Aryan stock with an Indo-Aryan language.
