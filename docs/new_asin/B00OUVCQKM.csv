6764551,1,B00OUVCQKM,"Terrible plot, bad acting, this is a B rated movie",1439510400,,50,4.1
6764552,3,B00OUVCQKM,Outrageously bad acting. Action sequences are slow and tedious. The fights are obviously choreographed not well. No redeeming value to this but I gave it a 3 star because of the concept which is fairly original. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. Low budget fun flick worth a look.,1438473600,,295,4.803921568627451

6764554,1,B00OUVCQKM,The filmmakers behind this must be actively working towards the death of hope and joy.,1437782400,,86,4.8
6764555,5,B00OUVCQKM,"If Early Sam Raimi had a baby with old Kung Fu flicks and Kevin Smith, plus some Buffy and a little bit of XMEN, it would look a lot like this. Not a big budget, but that adds to the charm.",1437696000,3,189,3.6341463414634148

6764559,4,B00OUVCQKM,Awesome! Very original. Good fight scenes. Plenty of cheesey one-liners.,1436227200,2,72,6.3

6764566,1,B00OUVCQKM,not good,1455667200,,8,3.5
6764567,4,B00OUVCQKM,Despite the budget used this movie was still very entertaining to say the least! The story jumps right in and there needs to be a little more explanation concerning events that happened between this one and Ninjas vs Vampires and some of the fight choreography left something to be desired but overall still very entertaining!,1454716800,,326,4.945454545454545
6764568,4,B00OUVCQKM,It was a decent movie if you like monsters and ninjas lol. I liked it but it was weird but then again I'm weird also lol.,1454544000,,121,3.6923076923076925
6764569,1,B00OUVCQKM,It's stupid and bad acting,1454544000,,26,4.4

Fair Kung Fui fighting.",1453075200,,104,4.526315789473684
6764571,2,B00OUVCQKM,"It had ninjas, witches, vampires, zombies, a werewolf, a frankenstein monster, and a mummy.

Acting and special effects were equivalent to a ""Made for Syfi Channel movie"" - OK.  Only watch this if you have nothing better to watch.  It isn't bad, just not very good.",1445558400,6,265,4.717391304347826
6764572,4,B00OUVCQKM,"Low budget shows, as does the love of the genre.  Good action, lots of one liners, good martial arts.  It's good cheesy fun.  Go in expecting B movie goodness, not high budget action movies, and you will love it.",1445126400,2,212,4.384615384615385
6764573,5,B00OUVCQKM,"So much fun! I own this on DVD - so stoked it's on Prime now!!! Definitely give it a watch if you love B horror, action, comedy, and awesome fights! This is the third in the series, but they do a good job of catching you up if you missed Ninjas VS. Zombies (1) and Ninjas VS. Vampires (2). This one is the best of the three for sure - but the first two are fun as well.",1440460800,,369,3.7435897435897436
6764574,3,B00OUVCQKM,"Decent little film on a tight budget. The dialogue was spiffy, cute, and filled with a lot of geek humor. Really enjoy the entire series, though it feels like I am missing chapters between each of the three films.",1440374400,3,213,4.487179487179487
6764575,4,B00OUVCQKM,"Funny, fleshed out characters, decent martial arts, and a cool followup to Ninjas vs Vampires.  I enjoyed it!",1440374400,3,109,5.055555555555555

8685058,4,B00OUVCQKM,"I will say, this was the most convoluted of the trilogy...

If you intend on watching this, you MUST watch Ninjas vs Zombies and Ninjas vs Vampires FIRST...  otherwise this movie will make absolutely no sense...  ( I also think the first 2 were actually better, but still giving this 4 stars as the finale to the trilogy )",1501459200,,322,4.423728813559322
8685059,1,B00OUVCQKM,"Bad, even for a bad movie.  Imagine if you invited all your friends to come make a movie, whatever character you like.  Then add low budget digital effects.

Whatever.  Does a lot of what it says on the tin.",1485216000,,207,4.230769230769231
8685060,1,B00OUVCQKM,I gave this movie one star because that was as low as I was allowed to go ! the real horror was not in the movie it was the movie !,1484784000,,131,3.2580645161290325
