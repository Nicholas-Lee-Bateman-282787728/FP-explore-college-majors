2345391,3,B000A0GXWY,It wasn't as good as the other films that I ordered for my niece.  It did not keep her attention,1361059200,,96,3.8
2345392,5,B000A0GXWY,"Watched this movie with my grandkids and we all loved it.  From the time the movie started, nobody moved.  It was great!",1355270400,,120,4.409090909090909
2345393,5,B000A0GXWY,My grandsons really enjoyed the movie The Littlest Light On The Christmas Tree.  They are 1 and three years old and were fascinated with the whole idea of Christmas trees and a ball that magically came to life.,1352332800,,210,4.526315789473684
2345394,2,B000A0GXWY,"I purchased this for my 5 year old who loves Christmas stories. The story itself is really interesting and cute, but the animation is atrocious. Creepy looking adults and they move strangely; it's like someone animated this for a school project. I know teenagers who can animate better than this.",1351382400,,296,4.94
2345395,5,B000A0GXWY,This is a very sweet movie..great music too.  My 3 year old watches it several time over the holiday season.,1323820800,,108,4.4
2345396,1,B000A0GXWY,"This is one of the worst animations that I have ever seen.  From stereotypical characters to poor animation to poor story writing and bad music, this video has all you've never wanted in a holiday film.",1301875200,,202,4.611111111111111
2345397,4,B000A0GXWY,"The movie arrived in a timely manner and about the time we expected it. The animation was very interesting, not as good as the cover leads you to believe, but interesting to watch. Adorable story.",1296172800,,196,4.628571428571429
2345398,4,B000A0GXWY,I have never heard of this movie. Very sweet. It's a nice addition to the rest of my Christmas movie collection.,1295222400,,112,4.380952380952381
2345399,1,B000A0GXWY,This was the second of 3 DVD boxes opened Christmas day for my 5 yr old daughter and also failed due to being the wrong Region. I ordered from Indonesia for delivery to Indonesia and it was a DVD for another Region. Well done AMAZON !!,1295136000,,235,4.130434782608695
2345400,4,B000A0GXWY,"Not great or original, the part I like best of this movie is the digital generated images, very well done..the tale is not very interesting, kids may like it, not sure,.may not be a holiday classic, but was good.",1291507200,,212,4.461538461538462
2345421,5,B000A0GXWY,"The story was good except they kept saying you have to believe but didn't say in what you must believe.  Being a Christmas story, I would assume you must believe in Jesus because that is the reason for the season. Right?",1263340800,,220,4.365853658536586
2345422,3,B000A0GXWY,GREAT,1230076800,,5,5.0

8071293,5,B000A0GXWY,"Great Message, good story....  Not up to the standards of big budget animation, so don't miss the message because your focused on the technical details....",1513987200,,155,5.2
8071294,1,B000A0GXWY,Couldn't make it through the first 5 minutes due to the horrible animation. It looks like one of the very first computer animated movies ever created. Looks more like a cheap video game.,1482192000,,186,4.666666666666667
8071295,5,B000A0GXWY,My mom originally found this movie at a dollar tree 4 years ago and it was a dollar well spent. My daughter was about 7 months old and was entertained the whole time. It was the only movie she would watch without getting bored and now 4 years later my son is hooked on this adorable Christmas movie. Animation is different from any other movie but I don't think it's a big deal it's still an adorable movie !,1474848000,,408,4.177215189873418

8071298,1,B000A0GXWY,I saw all the ratings and figured this would be great for my 3 year old nephew. We all sat down to watch it and I have to say I was embarrassed how bad the graphics were and the story drug out so long it was hard to follow.,1395705600,,223,3.5714285714285716

8071302,5,B000A0GXWY,"I love this movie, so do my kids age 2 through 7.  Sweet, simple, and has a plot also.  I like to give it at a gift since it is very reasonably priced.  True that there is no ""Jesus"" in it, but the themes of the season... joy, compassion, friendship, giving... they are all there.",1365724800,,280,4.054545454545455
