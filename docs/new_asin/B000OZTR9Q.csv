8187904,5,B000OZTR9Q,I've used parts of the DVD's with 4-6th graders as part of our study of certain stories.  The quality is good--so much better than cartoony type Bible for children.  The scenes are realistic.  It is not difficult to find the needed section.  The actor who is Jesus in Matthew is quite exceptional.  His Jesus is more joyful and relates to individuals.  He isn't a walking statue of Holman's Head of Christ picture.  He has personality.  These videos use Bible words without all the imagined extras that Hollywood adds to Bible stories.,1376265600,,535,4.802197802197802

8187906,5,B000OZTR9Q,"The thing I most appreciate about both of these videos is the attempt to stick to the text of the Bible.  The translation used is the NIV which may not appeal to some but I think it comes across very well for modern English speakers.  The other thing I like is the presentation of Jesus as a loving, compassionate and yes even humorous man.  I think He had the same emotions that all of us have though His were obviously never expressed in a sinful way.  Personally I prefer the Matthew video over the Acts video but they are both very good!",1227484800,,541,4.2745098039215685
