6959344,4,B00S6MBGY8,I liked the book.  I liked the movie.  I didn't like Reese Witherspoon as Cheryl.  Reese is too petite and wholesome to pull off the Cheryl character.  All the F words seemed forced.  I think Lindsey Lohan would have been perfect for the role.,1421798400,2,243,4.431818181818182
6959345,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Cheryl Grey/Strayed is hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. While being a farm girl, she knows nothing about hiking and camping, making many mistakes. She makes friends along the trail to help her. The reason for her journey is to become reborn. She wants to become the person her mother raised and expected her to be. The film has numerous flashbacks to her past, her mother's death, her marriage, her heroin use, her infidelities, and family. She remembers the good and the bad, life's pain and frustrations. Cheryl is educated and leaves poems and quotes along the way in the hiking journals, becoming the ""Queen of the PCT.""

It is a story about starting anew and seeking redemption.

Reese gives us a great performance. Her rediscovery is not based in religion. She develops her own philosophy along the way, her own goals, and learns the value of having shoes that fit. A film with a few hidden metaphors. I felt the film was geared more toward women then men, but enjoyable nonetheless.

6959346,4,B00S6MBGY8,"I wasn't planning to watch this movie.  I am not a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon (neither am I a detractor), and 2 hours of her hiking through the woods just didn't seem like something I would ever really be in the mood for.

But this movie is so much more than that.  Based on Cheryl Strayeds real life experience, this movie is full of beautifully shot scenes throughout the Pacific Northwest  absolutely gorgeous.  This is an epic hike of over 1,000 miles, but more than that, it is a soulful journey of discovery, healing and the inherent transformation of this woman as she discovers who she is.  The many flashbacks throughout introduce us to her life - her ex, her mother, etc., and give us the very clear and understandable ""why"" of the story.

Reese Witherspoon is amazing as the heroine in this, and it is easy to forget she is acting.  While she is still not my favorite actor, she has definitely jumped up the list, and I am no longer agnostic  she has some great talent.  There are a few cringe-worthy points in the movie, as well as some comically appropriate points, which all flow together naturally and never give the impression of staged or forced.

I loved this movie, and I think almost everyone can identify and relate to this journey, even if only recognizing the desire to do something similar at some point.

Hint: This book, Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail, was an Oprah selection, and is also available on Amazon at: http://www.amazon.com/Wild/dp/B007MIWUG0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421535112&sr=8-1&keywords=wild+from+lost+to+found+on+the+pacific+crest+trail.  It is well worth reading, or listening to the audible version.  I have just started it myself after watching this.",1421452800,170,1721,5.035335689045937
6959347,4,B00S6MBGY8,"I saw this film as a fluke. My wife and I went to see another flick which, as it turns out, couldn't be screened because the heater in that particular theater wasn't working. They offered us a free view for any other movie. ""Wild"" was the next closest on the clock so we decided on that. I'm glad we did.

Here's the scoop. Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) feels the need to traverse the Pacific Coast Trail as sort of a penance. She was leading a bad life and felt guilty about it when her mum died. She wants to turn into a person her mother would be proud of. So she buys supplies, starts in San Diego and works her way up some 1,100 miles to the trail's northernmost point. This is a diary of that trek.

As I was the only male in the audience I guess it would be safe to call this a chick flick. That being said I enjoyed it thoroughly. I like Reese Witherspoon and she doesn't disappoint here. She has a lot of good lines to chew on and even in her silence it's not like watching trees grow. Her story zips back and forth between her travel, her bad times and a lot of scenes with her, her brother and mother (played by Laura Dern) so you get a good feeling on why she is doing this to begin with. Good attention is paid to the landscape. Going from the desert of the southwest, then further north when things start to turn green, then hitting the Pacific Northwest, where things get really lush, the viewer feels as though they are on the journey as well. The folk she meets along the way help things along as well. They are of all sorts but their dialogue is very plain. You don't feel the writer's pen intruding and trying to show off.

This is shot well and the music is almost invisible. All aspects of the production melt smoothly with one another.

Whatever good you've heard about this movie is true. And whatever small criticisms someone could make, that turn it into less than an astounding movie-going experience, don't lessen the fact that this is better than a lot of other films out there.",1421366400,11,2011,4.298153034300792
6959348,5,B00S6MBGY8,"In a recent interview, actor Reese Witherspoon said something to the effect that she started her own production company in order to make films she and her partners wanted to make and that they would have a strong female influence.  If ""Wild"" is any indication of what will come, I can't wait.  This film is based on the memoir, ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"" by Cheryl Strayed and was scripted by Nick Hornby.  With Witherspoon as Cheryl, the film is directed by Jean-Marc Vallee (""Dallas Buyers Club"") with drama, humor and a deep look into the soul of the troubled woman.

The film opens with a hilarious scene of neophyte hiker Cheryl trying to attach her over-stuffed backpack to her shoulders.  The backpack is literally as big and heavy as the woman.  The film manages to go back and forth between events on the trail and those that led up to the woman attempting such a daunting test.  That is, to walk a 1000 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail to Oregon.  During the 3 month journey we learn how earlier events in her life led to a failed marriage, drug addiction and random sex.  Seeing a brochure in a store, Cheryl decides to strike out on her own on the hike to Oregon where she has decided to settle.  Along the way, she meets strangers, some friendly, some not.  The journey is painful, both physically and emotionally, for both Cheryl, and I suspect Ms. Witherspoon.

There is a strong supporting performance by Laura Dern as Cheryl's mother Bobbi, but Witherspoon carries the weight, literally and figuratively in this award-worthy film.  I can think of no stronger performance this year.  The film is beautifully shot, using locations in Oregon and Washington.  Cinematographer, Yves Belanger mixes the ruggedness of the wilderness with its natural beauty.  Witherspoon and her business partner Bruna Papandrea were also heavily involved in this year's ""Gone Girl.""  They are off to a terrific start.  I love this film.",1421280000,25,1957,4.773809523809524
6959349,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Anytime you compare a book to a movie, you might be setting yourself up for a let down. I am a hiker and enjoyed the movie and have highly recommended it to my family, coworkers and neighbor. My neighbor today thanked me for recommending the movie. She had taken her mother and they both enjoyed it. It seems that each viewer takes away different inspirations from the movie. The music was especially enjoyable to me. If you think you would enjoy an inspirational movie about a journey to becoming your best self, then you will enjoy this movie. A great way to kick the new year off. It does have adult content so may not be suitable for everyone.",1420934400,24,647,4.445378151260504
6959350,1,B00S6MBGY8,"As I watched this movie, I started out at 3 stars, then down to 2. By the end I was at 1-star and wishing I hadn't wasted nearly 2 hours.

To keep it short, I don't think the screenwriter even read the book. Maybe someone just told him what it was about. The movie dwells on a very BORING hike (and I'm an avid hiker!) Things scarier have happened to me on hikes started in the dead of night than in this movie. Instead of the complex story of Cheryl, her mother and her 3 siblings,( 2 of which were ""killed off"" to save money I guess ) the movie  dwells on the absoultely boring, FORGETABLE hikers she meets up with..

Laura Dern as author Cheryl's mother is a giggly loon, obnoxiously giggly like she was in ""Jusassic Park "" when she'd first fallen in love with Jeff Goldblum on set . Cheryl's mother was a bit of a free spirit but not a nut-case like Dern portrays. This very important story of family is portrayed in flashback ""maching gun editing"" and is very confusing. Chery'ls mother's horse is old and dying but the kids don't have the money to pay a vet, so they have to kill it themselves after several horrific gunshots. They just skimmed that part and if you didn't read the book, you don't know what's going on.  My 90 yr old mother was with me, didn't have a clue what the story was about and she's still mentally sharp.

Cheryl's life choices were terrible. She became a heroin addict who conceived and aborted a baby that would have been addicted. I'm sure she will regret that to the end of her life. But in the end, she has redeemed herself. I definitely not a feminist, but I  think a woman screenwriter and director could have put more heart and soul into this one. (Angelina, you should have grabbed this one!) At the end, the sparse audience seemed to wake up and leave before the end titles.",1420934400,12,1815,4.30791788856305
6959351,4,B00S6MBGY8,"ain't no legally blond. RW continues to show her talent. The movie has taken, the warts and all tale, and told the story of a woman's journey back to the best of herself. Well done.",1420761600,3,181,4.2
6959352,4,B00S6MBGY8,"""Wild""(2014) stars Reese Witherspoon as Cheryl Strayed, a young woman who walks the Pacific Crest Trail from California's Mojave Desert to the Bridge of the Gods at the Oregon-Washington border. Cheryl is the gritty survivor of a troubled life; the long walk is an escape from that life and a journey to a hoped-for personal salvation.

As the movie begins, Cheryl has no idea of the dimensions of the challenge she has taken on, not least the need to master the oversized pile of gear stuffed into her huge pack. The movie tells her story in a series of flashbacks as a determined Cheryl walks north, day after day, challenged by the environment and wrestling with her personal demons. Her encounters with other people on the trail are part of the interest, and the drama, of the story. The scenery is fantastic, the story is heartbreaking in places, humorous in others, and ultimately delivers on its premise in a convincing way. It is the kind of movie that may stay with the thoughtful viewer for a while. Strongly recommended.",1420675200,4,1031,4.759776536312849
6959353,4,B00S6MBGY8,"With a Golden Globes nomination for this role already under her belt, Reese Witherspoon has been doing things right lately. Many other awards are pending from film festivals, etc., for Ms. Witherspoon, Laura Dern and their director, Canadian Jean-Marc Valle (""Dallas Buyers Club""). The script by Nick Hornby (""About a Boy"") is based on Cheryl Strayed's memoir: ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail.""

Our distraught heroine sets out on a one-woman 1,100 mile trek along the Pacific Crest Trail, through California to Oregon. Her beloved mother has just died and we can see she clearly is overloaded with both camping and emotional baggage. Flashbacks teach us just how wild she has been, AND we learn how she came by that last name. Over the course of the movie she meets people along the way, some generous and kind; others ...not so much. We also see the elements in her life that shaped her and hurt her.

The cast:
  * Reese Witherspoon (""The Good Lie"") There's very little Cheryl hasn't done and her psychiatrist can't get her to admit she's sorry.
  * Laura Dern (""The Fault in Our Stars"") Bobbi is determined that her children will not have their lives scarred by their drunken, abusive father. She is incorrigibly upbeat...to her daughter's dismay!
  * Keene McRae (""CBGB"") Leif refuses to believe his mother might die, as though thinking might make it so.
  * Gaby Hoffman (""Veronica Mars"") is Cheryl's best friend, Aimee. Hers is the voice of reason as she watches her friend come undone.
  * There is a wide assortment of men who appear and disappear, both along the trail and in flashbacks. Suffice it to say, Cheryl is seldom alone for very long....

The first I encountered anything like this was when I watched ""The Way,"" with Martin Sheen. If I watch enough of these movies, eventually I will come to understand these ""trails."" Evidently they are marked out, with rest stations along the way and guest books for hikers to sign (Cheryl's comments generate interest among other hikers). Packages can be sent ahead from friends and family to intercept the trekker with replacement items, such as new boots (from REI), fuel, and/or money. She also receives letters from her ex, for which she is deeply grateful.

This is R-rated and rightly so! Expect drinking, drug use, sex, nudity and a heavy barrage of ""F"" bombs. I had to remind myself I was really watching Reese Witherspoon pull off that bloody toenail! And take off all those clothes! And topple over with that enormous back pack!

Finally I realized that I like the movie, but just don't warm to Cheryl Strayed's character. I was glad I had the option of closed captions, as much of the dialogue consists of interior thoughts as she hikes. Eventually she decides she'd rather be a hammer than a nail and the music on the soundtrack echoes her thoughts.",1420675200,5,2839,4.777096114519427

6959379,5,B00S6MBGY8,"to start with , this movie is based on a true story , that cam e from the book,
and the real cheryl in the book is on set  while this movie was made,
cheryl lost her mother at a young age and  and her and her brother had no one else,
after her mother( laura dern) passed, cheryl went through the some really hard and bad times,
she was shooting drugs,  having sex with any man that would have her and other bad things,
you will see in this movie, only to decide she needed to find herself and  she decided to hike
1100  miles over the pacific crest, she  went through a lot to just make it day to day , but with
her flashbacks of her life with her mother and all the reminders and advice her mother had given her over  her years
 and being able to live those things and meet some good and bad people on the trials along the way
she was finally able to make it  and she was alive and well and  what happened to afterwards was even better,
watching this movie , may make you think of your past life and how  you could have done better  or maybe do better in the future
and you can pass this this on to your kids or whoever, but if you watch this movie, after the show itself is over
watch the credits , you will get to see  some of the pictures of the real cheryl  as she was hiking,
and  there is  the extras you always see  at the start of most movies, after the movie , go back and watch it,
there you will get to see and hear cheryl and her friends and see Reese and her talk and cheryl really tells the story again!

Overall, the movie was powerful. I had more teary-eyed moments watching the movie than I did while reading the book. Some parts and people that were visible in the book were skimmed over or left out of the movie, but not in a way that I felt retracted from the overall story.  Reese Witherspoon was excellent. I was afraid that some parts of the book would feel forced when translated to film, and some lines were a bit pushy and leading (ie: Lady saved my life, remember, when I left your dad?) in order to summarize instead of demonstrate... but for the most part it was well done.

I enjoyed how the director, went back in time as she was moving and dealing with the memories, pain, fun and love.  My only thing, I would have liked to have seen was pictures of 'where she is now'.  Reese was profound, intense and memorable.  I fell in love with her as a person as a woman...

6959460,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Not at all what I thought, ...although I did watch it to the very end,....I rejected watching it at all.

  Most of the world lives in a pretty dark, depressed, angry, or sad place.  If you are there...this might give you something.  For others that are in a positive or hopeful place, this will most likely leave you in a negative place.  After watching this movie, and I wanted to go hiking, now I never want to hike ever more than four miles ever.  After, I was left with this feeling that all life sucks.  And I tried to walk it off.... It has been 24 hours of trying to come back out of that dark place.  I'm half way back to my usual self, not totally, still feel crappy.  Now taking the time to warn others....don't watch this if you are in a good place!!

The director and writers keep this ""really dark"" and low throughout.  I heard the book was better.  But now. I will never read it.
The movie focuses on the death of the main character's (cheryl) mother...and she has flashbacks, horrid flashbacks, she she
The main character is not likeable, and I love Reese, he stays in the dark place throughout.  The men in the movie are all portrayed badly, rapists abusers, sleazy,.....not one good thing happens.
I do love Reese, but she has already proved herself as an actress.  I don't know why she took such a low and lost part.

I wish I could unwatch this.  I only stayed because, I love hiking, I thought there would be a turning point, and hope, but NOPE!  Some will argue that the last scene on the bridge there was some hope, but Cheryl was still left in a horrid place, yay for her for making it, but not good enough directors!!!

This is about, a woman without self respect,..does everything she can o numb herself, does horrible things...sleeps around a lot, heroin, has no love for herself.  Maybe some of you can relate to that.  I can relate to pain, but not like this. I guess I value myself too much.

6959464,1,B00S6MBGY8,"This movie could have been a classic on the order of ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Alas, Hollywood Rot killed this potential classic in the cradle.

The basic plot line is inspirational -- the attempts of a troubled young woman (Reese Witherspoon) to overcome the childhood traumas of her parents' divorce, poverty as well as her mother's early death at age 45 -- traumas which crippled Reese's character, preventing her from finding beauty in life. Laura Dern as the mother gives an appealingly nuanced performance of a mother who loves her children and does her best for them; she rises above their troubles.  Reese Witherspoon as the daughter makes us care about her struggles even when she descends into ugly, self-destructive behaviors.. After Reese's character reaches rock bottom emotionally, she decides to take a long, hopefully spirit-renewing,  hike along Western trails as a means of re-connecting with her best self -- the self that is reflective of her mother's ability to express joy despite discouraging circumstances.

Reese begins her healing journey against the backdrop of stunning Western scenery. The beautiful scenery in this movie could have provided the subtext for Reese's discovery of the same indomitable, life-loving spirit that infused her mother.  But nooooooooo.  That type of feel-good narrative would be too positive, too life-loving, too humanity-affirming for the mangy human gargoyles who roam Hollywood and churn out the soul-destroying Hollywood Blight.

Hollywood movies cannot be allowed to be beautiful.  A Hollywood movie must poison Nature's natural healing powers and Reese's every human encounter.  The majority of  WHITE men that Reese meets on the trail are not allowed to be normal.  No. ... Hollywood's gargoyles must infuse the threat of rape into Reese's every encounter with WHITE men.  Her every encounter hints at danger. Her dialogue with the WHITE men she  meets -- even those who turn out to be helpful -- is laden with sexual innuendo. In addition, Reese's memories, which we see in flashback, are filled with nasty sexual debauches with nasty WHITE men. Every WHITE man is portrayed as a potential rapist.

As a result, watching this movie of self-healing and self-discovery along a trail of spectacular scenery, becomes a prolonged, agonizing cliffhanger of  ""Is our cute Reese going to be raaaaaped by these leering, red neck WHITE men?""  ""Wild"" becomes a poster child for the usual Hollywood smut and smear campaign that portrays WHITE men as red necks and bullies.

The movie does have ONE hero -- albeit not a human one.  The hero turns out to be the outdoors company REI which replaces Reese's hiking boots for FREE!  What a deal!  Vat's not to like?  A movie with violent sex, male nudity, and free hiking boots.

Hooray for Hollyweird. . . .Too bad for Reese and Laura Dern.  This movie could have been  iconic.",1513987200,4,2875,5.0918803418803416
6959465,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Almost six years ago the Vine program offered me the book version of Cheryl Strayeds hike along the Pacific Coast Trail. I gave the book a 5-star review, and used the same subject title as I am using for the movie review. The subject line is Doug Peacocks title to his memoir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walking-It-Off-A-Veteran-s-Chronicle-of-War-And-Wilderness/dp/0910055998/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walking It Off: A Veteran's Chronicle of War And Wilderness</a>&nbsp;on overcoming his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after the Vietnam War. He took to the wilderness, and long hikes. Peacock served as the model for George Washington Hayduke in Edward Abbeys environmental classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Monkey-Wrench-Gang-P-S/dp/0061129763/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Monkey Wrench Gang (P.S.)</a>.

The biggest appeal of watching the movie, since I already knew the story, lay in the hopes of some stunning scenery along the Pacific Coast Trail. I found that the movie largely tracked the book. Strayed had a troubled life: a father who disappeared too early in life, a mother who died early also, of cancer, a marriage that did not provide the support and meaning that she needed, leading to heroin addiction and mindless couplings or, as one character said in the movie: you give yourself to any man who asks.

The solution? As Peacock discovered: Walk it off. Virtually no preparation, which can be maddening, and although I am a big advocate of belts and suspenders (i.e., some redundancy) when on ones own, and a bit of planning, she largely winged it, with predictable consequences. Reading the directions to the cooking stove, for the first time, at the first campsite, and then realizing you have the wrong fuel, is a leading indicator that would predict an early bail out. True Grit prevailed though, and I sure admire her for that. She gets the right fuel, and lightens her load, with the help of a wise trail angel.

The movie depicted well the incident in the book of the classic problem of women alone: not rattlesnakes or bears, but jerk men or worse, who see you as an easy prey. It is enraging, and as a man, embarrassing, that just one man can intrude, and even terrorize, when there are all those other matters to deal with like securing the next dry campsite.

I did not get the stunning landscapes that I had hoped for the cinema graphics were just OK. The principle problem of the movie (as well as the book) though, is that one did not get the sense that she overcame the PTSD, as it were.  Far too many flashbacks, as though she was still having to relive it. There was no sense that she developed a feel for the natural world, the plants, the topography, obtaining some solace there that heals the trauma. The hike was mainly a slog, humpin that pack, like in the Nam. Enduring. Yes, the slog was a significant achievement, and I will continue to admire her for that, and her long walk, thereby restored a sense of self-worth, but did it encapsulate the demons and dilemmas of the past in a shell, still accessible, but relegated to a small portion of your thoughts, as you hope to discover what is around the next curve on the trail? And has she taken a long-distance hike since? Her website says that hiking is one of her favorite activities still. But there is no hint that Wild II is in the foreseeable future. Her story apparently resonates, with 13,000 plus reviews of the book at Amazon, and 4,000 plus for the movie as opposed to 24 for Peacocks book which might correspond to the ratio of people who have had those two very different versions of PTSD. For the movie, 4-stars.",1513728000,4,3720,5.081833060556465

I'm shocked that an actress like Reese felt obligated to make this trash with her baked boobs constantly on display, her main character screws anyone and everyone, in lurid detail, and despite her ""I am woman, hear me roar, bitchibess, she constantly depends on the kindness and supplies of the middle class working man.

I suppose it is a story about someone finding themselves and causing a lot of pain to others along the way because she didn't know herself to start out with. Many people live their lives not knowing who they are and hurt others along the way as a result. She didn't do this intentionally of course. It is too bad she didn't go see a shrink or read some books like, ""The Road Less Traveled."" She might have salvaged her marriage and not hurt so many people.

Each of her encounters is teased as a threat but actually turns out to be an aide on her journey. Having said all this, I still quite enjoyed it. As a story it lacks propulsive force but man oh man does it have moments. Vall&eacute; does an excellent job eliding past and present. Jumping from moment to moment the way the mind does, associations of senses and songs and words. It's a devastating account of grief.

I think the production was excellent.  The story, told in flashback, at some points required attention to keep it together....attention which I gladly leant as the story itself was about the sloppiness of life and sometimes soul-homicidal treatment dealt us by 'life' events (such as death of a loved one or of a relationship), deceptive and manipulative relationships with others, and (eventually as Cheryl Strayed recognizes) with our 'self'.

6959641,1,B00S6MBGY8,"I can honestly say that anyone who has ever backpacked would say this movie showed a woman who did no research and embarked on an adventure to walk a 3 month trail. Many of the things that went wrong could have been sloved by going on the Internet for just a few minutes or any outdoor store. To walk that trail is incredible, and many people couldn't, which in that aspect is impressive. But the movie showed the weak points of preparing for backpacking and really, a beautiful woman having people help her along the way. Its a film about pretending that you can find something in yourself when really you have to figure out how to best find yourself, which may not be hiking. It could be as simple doing something out of routine. I'm not impressed by this movie, I've had many more interesting backing trips myself.",1489190400,4,817,4.489932885906041

6959697,1,B00S6MBGY8,"Unnecessary, graphic nudity of Reese Witherspoon and unnecessary scenes of Reese having graphic sexual-intercourse attack the hearts of men and boys; soliciting men and boys to lust, and leaving an image in their minds forever. Reese, the feminist, clearly does not care about harming men and boys, and rejects responsibility and accountability; at least until she stands before God to give an account.

Why does Reese Witherspoon bother going to Catholic church when her actions are contrary to the Bible; contrary to God's ways; contrary to the moral-values she claims to promote; contrary to caring about men and boys. Imprinting the hearts of men and boys with graphic nudity and sex is contrary to God's ways. Reese claims to be outspoken, but has only been outspoken for immorality and has never been outspoken for Jesus. This film is a true story. The film dismisses the character's use of heroin and promiscuous-sex with acquaintances as a lot of fun and harmless. Reese was a vanity producer of this film in name only. Others are influencing her for the worse; rather than her ever being a positive influence of morality upon others.

Only some of the locations were on the Pacific Crest Trail. The film filmed elsewhere to save money. This film should have been all about the beauty of the Pacific Crest Trail; friendships made on the trail; positive experiences; and what to carry and how to make the trek a good one. Even without the graphic nudity and graphic sexual-intercourse; this film would be no more than 3-stars. A pretty woman hiking the trail alone is foolish, because of sexual-predators and robbers; another thing this film whitewashes over. Hiking the 2,600-mile trail; through deserts without water and over 13,000-foot snow-capped peaks is a great accomplishment. I bought this film for that adventure, but was not inspired.

There is some good scenery on location. Reese makes a few friends on the trail and has some experiences. The hike did not bring the character any closer to God, but was only a lucrative book deal and movie deal. I'm throwing it out.",1485043200,,2086,4.954285714285715

6959712,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Probably one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen.
I got this because I love watching Reese Witherspoon. I think she is a great actress, and can act many different rolls.
Her acting was not lacking at all. All performances were great, the nature scenes were fantastic. If I could give stars for the acting performances and then separate stars for the actual movie overall, I would give the acting many more than two stars.

I just kept waiting for the movie to take a turn and start to be uplifting or empowering. It never did take that turn, and when it ended, I just felt empty and depressed. I don't really go for those kind of movies any longer.
Life is too short and depressing to watch someone else's depressing life and their mistakes. And boy were the mistakes doozies! But I felt that at the end, she didn't really learn anything.
Was hoping for at least some funny or sweet moments. Those never came.
No moral, no lesson learned, nothing. No epiphany, etc. Very disappointed...
And almost 2 years after seeing it, I still get that infuriatingly stupid hammer/nail song stuck in my head! If anything, save yourself from that!",1484352000,,1144,4.607843137254902

Sure it has elements of it but it's really a book about ""my life as a drug addicted slut"".  The porographic scenes added nothing to the story and for those of us wanting to avoid that disease infesting our souls it was dissappointing to see them put so much in there.  Sure, one scene at the beginning to enphasize that she was a slut.  Why inject more and more of it as the movies goes along?

The movie lacked so many stories that made her trip interesting. The flashes of her sucking d@#ks was not necessary to sell this story..I understand it had a lot to do with how she got her but it was totally not needed in the movie.. I was watching the movie on an airplane and quite shocked when the scenes appeared on my screen.. I was ready to turn it off right then but figured is was over and I was safe to keep watching..nope several more later I just think it cheapen the whole movie.

6959808,3,B00S6MBGY8,"I read the book and wondered, ""what was she thinking!"" Talked to a friend about the movie. He liked it, so I watched it. What I enjoyed most about the book was the hiking challenges and give-and-take with other hikers-- NOT the gripping sadness of Cheryl's life. While reading, I began to skip over the sad parts, and move on to the hiking and the challenges with nature. After awhile the hiking and the self pity became redundant. Maybe three stars is too many. Reese acted this out well -- it's just not a very good story for adults. This is a book for twenty-somethings, not for the mature adult who has already struggled through so much of this personal angst.",1480118400,,664,4.4958677685950414

I definitely plan to read it. I can identify with the effect that her mother's death had on Cheryl, since my mother's death was one of the most traumatic events of my life. I did my own version of a walkabout, nothing so strenuous as hiking a thousand miles, but almost as drastic. I can see how that kind of constant physical activity, with only occasional mental stimulation from meeting other people along the trail, would force a person to face all the painful memories they had been suppressing. I'm sure it also helped to clear the drugs out of her system. I wish the movie had shown how she prepared for the trek (if she did any real preparation at all besides buying a lot of stuff she didn't need). Maybe the book goes into more detail. I read ""Into the Wild"" and also saw the movie, and that guy didn't prepare at all, and of course he ended up dying. It sounded like he had some mental problems, though. Cheryl may have had a bit of PTSD from her mother's death and then from her divorce (which she caused by her acting out after her mother's death) but otherwise she seemed pretty stable. I am eager to read the book and get all the details.",1480118400,,1306,4.270161290322581

What I wish I had known first, was how this story wasn't properly researched and many people believe that Cheryl Strayed is a fraud, me included.  So many things did not add up, how does a heroin addict just walk away from that drug and embark on a hike?  No withdrawals whatsoever?  And she is so broke after her drug binging, but has money to buy an abortion and drugs, and camping equipment, but DOESN'T have money to put her mother's horse down humanely, so forces her brother to shoot it 4 times and watches it suffer to its death?  Seriously, I wanted to see redeeming qualities in this woman but I think she is a lowlife and somehow duped Oprah and Reese into thinking she had a meaningful story to tell.  What a CON and hello - animal cruelty and her lack of regret tell me everything about this depraved, nasty woman.

The writing itself wasn't bad, but not great. It's lyrical in places, there's humor, and some suspense, (albeit a little contrived feeling) and it IS a good story, but I was shocked to learn that this was not a debut for the author.

Everything that led Ms. Strayed to the trail was part of the promotion for the book, so much so that the rest, as outlined in the book was excruciating, superfluous detail.

I got hooked quickly and easily, and then it fell flat and I got bored. The first 2/3 were meticulously detailed, then she seemed to warp speed through the rest, in that tell-tale ""deadline is looming"" kind of way.

I was under the impression it was more about the trail, and less about the events that led her there, but I can let that go. But, being an avid hiker, there was this nagging unease about its authenticity leaving me to wonder how much of the trail was REALLY hiked? Just enough to depict the setting of a good story? We're those conclusions really learned ON the trail?  We all deserve a fresh start from time to time, and it's great that she pulled herself up by the bootstraps and lived to tell about it so if there needs to be any embellishment, I guess that has to be ok.

Overwhelming grief at her mother's death affects author Cheryl Strayed deeply, first setting her wildly out of control and into bad choices and regrettable decisions, and finally, into the journey of her life.  She sets out to walk the Pacific Crest Trail from California to Canada with an impossibly over-loaded backpack nick-named Monster (symbolically, the huge load of sorrow and grief she is carrying) and, as expected, goes through an internal journey of self-discovery and ultimately, healing as she doggedly hikes along the Trail.

There is really only one argument I have about the film, and that is that it was far less detailed than the book; in most cases, this would not be a problem, but when you're watching the solitary journey of a single person, with little dialogue and only memories to ""explain"" everything, you lose a great deal of motivation. You can't understand the complicated feelings Strayed had to deal with, the consequences of her own actions, and the grief. You just can't get it by WATCHING. You have to LISTEN to Strayed herself, and the only way to do that is to read her book first. Then, and only then, does the film come together and shine as the little gem it really is. You're able to see how well Witherspoon does her job, and what issues she walked through. I recommend the movie for a brief entertaining glimpse, but the real diamond is not the film--it's the book it was made from.  Despite the good acting, the fabulous scenery and the amazing story, it needs more. But even with that criticism, you will enjoy the ride.",1474070400,,1177,4.525821596244131

It is a shame Hollywood puts out such terrible movies and a shame the actors who contribute to them make millions of dollars spewing out this trash.

Enjoyed both book and movie very much.  Excellent description of problems the heroine faced while hiking the PCT.  This book and movie have motivated a huge increase in PCT hikers.  (Kudos to anyone trying and/or completing the PCT-what an achievement!).
  The movie is better than a simple documentary of hiking the PCT.  This is also a story about a person dealing with the slings and arrows life throws at us.
  Only wish is that Amazon would add to Prime.

I imagine that the true journey of self-discovery was probably a lot more meaningful, but to boil down a 6-month hiking trek into a 2-hour movie makes the whole story seem trite. The main character isn't developed enough to be relatable, and there isn't enough time to understand her emotional journey.
Some life events can be profound and meaningful in a way that teaches a lot to you, but that doesn't mean that they will appeal to anyone besides yourself.",1473033600,3,574,4.693069306930693

READ THE BOOK!! ...and since I had read the book, that may have tainted my viewing of the movie, but I knew what was going on, and it was confusing to me. There is no emotional investment into the character, like there is in the book, and it didn't look like the trail was pummeling her at all. It's too bad - we are Reese fans.

6960057,4,B00S6MBGY8,"A dramatized glimpse into the mind of someone whose outward life has taken on the appearance of her inward strain, and her journey to fix it.  The movie is hard to watch in moments, her running from the pain, into anything that will numb it.  I felt as if the disjointed flow, the flash backs, not always clear, not always complete, felt like an attempt of portraying her mind.  I took her removing herself from everything, everyone, to be forced into facing the issues that haunted her.  Rehab doesn't work if you won't deal with the underlying causes.  He trip forced her to face it.  Sure it was dramatized, a bit rushed (I would have liked another 30 minutes of her journey), but I loved the ending.  On the vagueness of the story: maybe that was done so that we can apply the struggle to ourselves or loved ones.  The director's idea to make us relate.",1464825600,,857,4.448717948717949

6960063,5,B00S6MBGY8,Awesome movie!,1464393600,,14,6.5
6960064,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Like this movie, but don't consider it Academy Award.  Not a fan of Reese's more recent films (her early ones were excellent) that I felt mostly wasted her talent.  But after not liking this initially as a chick flick, I finally watched all of it, and found it a little slow, but quite good.  I love seeing challenged people overcome adversity.  My lay counselling background has given me a great appreciation of success stories, having seen many of both success and failure.  The few brief nudity scenes certainly show how beautiful this Texas woman can be, but are only flashes, and actually lend gravity to the story.  Reese is very good in this.
Initially, the BD (from Amazon) would not play.  It would get to the initial blurb, but wouldn't go to the movie.  I'd read that some copies of this BD were ""bad"".  So sent it back, and Amazon replaced it.  Put the new one in and got the same initial problem.  Being stubborn sometimes (?), I fiddled with the Cyberlink Power DVD Ultra, my favorite player.  I have a brand new Dell laptop with 6th Gen CPU, plenty of RAM, etc., but only a DVD player/burner.  I added an external BD player that has worked with a number of BD disks, but not ""Wild"".  But my stubbornness paid off: I discovered that the Ultra had preset ""2D to 3D"" in the taskbar control, so unchecked it.  For some reason, I got the 3D (with multi-pictures) version on my non-3D laptop screen.  Since that is not usual, went into the Cyberlink's master controls and found the same item still checked.  I unchecked it, and voila!, the BD played flawlessly (except it doesn't fit the laptop screen well, seemingly letterbox with upper and lower black spaces).  So did the original, so not Amazon's fault, not the BD's fault, just a misplaced presetting.  So will donate one of the copies and not hit Amazon for the return.  My apologies, Amazon, this was a first time problem and solution for me, and leave the charge on my card.",1464307200,,1942,4.557803468208093

You didn't get a good sense of the type of people that were in her life or the people she met on the trail.  I also felt that in the movie Strayed lacked the personality and sarcastic humor that shined in the book.

In an effort to jam everything from the book into the movie, we're left with a disjointed story with jarring flashbacks.  Do yourself a favor and read the book--skip the movie.",1464048000,3,568,4.423076923076923

6960068,5,B00S6MBGY8,"I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected.  I'm sure the book is very good (which I have not read YET).  For the reviewers who said the flashbacks of her relationship with her mother were not powerful enough,  I would imagine none of them have trekked through 120 degree heat, through rivers, snow, rain, etc. carrying 50-75 pounds on their backs for a thousand miles.  These memories were a constant part of her journey, and no she didn't remember only the happy times.  She had a lot of regrets for taking her mom and husband for granted.
The part that saddened me was when she reverted to sleeping with the guy I believe in Oregon.  I did think she would try to abstain for purposes of transforming herself during her journey.  But, that's so true of all of us.  Rarely, do people completely let go of old habits.  She accepts her past and decides to let it go.  That is definitely part of the healing process.  I can imagine the book which I will read this summer was amazing.",1463961600,,985,4.416666666666667

6960070,3,B00S6MBGY8,"We don't witness her learning anything out on the trail. No transformations. There are a few moments when strangers are kind and that feels redemptive, and a couple beautiful moments with a fox, but other than that almost nothing happens and then in the last minute, as she approaches the end of the trail,  we get a gorgeous brief inner monologue wherein she figures out the deep meaning and sacredness of her wild and wooly life.

I also felt no longing or love for her mother in any of the flashbacks. I could not feel any sense of loss because the love for her mother was not set up, every scene with her mother was either ugly, them arguing or cliched and ordinary. And I have no idea why people say that Reese's acting was so good. I have seen her do much better work than this film required. She basically had a blank, tired expression for most of the film. Some nice scenery but the pacing was boring.",1463961600,2,909,4.372781065088757

6960164,1,B00S6MBGY8,"This movie ignores the compelling story of HOW a woman would hike the pacific coast trail solo, to instead tell the narcissistic story of WHY a woman would hike the pacific coast trail solo.  There is more footage in this movie dedicated to taking drugs and having sex than there is about surviving in the wild. This is not an exaggeration.

Brave Reese Witherspoon shines in this brave portrayal that is so un-stereotypical, mysterious, and brave.

This movie scores points with feminists and man-haters alike who are unable to recognize when movies are preying on their low-hanging fruit vulnerabilities, prejudices, and fears.  If you've ever wondered what the exact polar opposite of a Rambo movie was, this is it.  Two hours of cinema dedicated to exploiting the base impulses and desires of women. What should have been an interesting story is suffocated by one-dimensional characters, clich flashbacks, stale dialog, and easy shock value.

The 'Wild' script in a nutshell:  Woman takes a glorified spiritual journey starting out as a dried up disgusting egotist, evolving at the end into a dirty, dried up disgusting egotist.",1455840000,,1132,5.119565217391305

6960171,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Witherspoon does a good job and really appears to work hard - but, frankly, to make a movie about a hike is, well, kind of boring.  The flashbacks are well done but, overall, this movie really doesn't connect (even close) to what Strayed shared in her book.  Probably just 'had to be written and read' to really get it.",1455580800,2,319,4.389830508474576

Reese does a great job connecting to the emotions of the book and bringing this story to life. So many stories about women are about their search for a man.  This story is about her search for herself after losing her mother.  It's beautiful and inspiring and refreshingly honest.  Why haven't you ordered it yet?",1455321600,,435,4.468354430379747

6960183,5,B00S6MBGY8,"I've spent my life pushing boundaries, hiking trails, running mountains, seeking lonely places. What a remarkable film. The authentic story delves deep into childhood pain, adult dysfunction, sacrifice, and healing. Raw and real, Witherspoon is a dynamo. Frankly, I had resisted watching this sooner. I continue to break trail in mounds of snow, crunch across frozen rivers, and hike to that high edge of wilderness where mountain meets fog and sky, and the earth meets the soul. I go miles to see bald eagles, porcupines climbing trees, mice tunneling snow, bears, trails with wolf tracks, and I can't recommend this film enough. Thank you.",1454976000,,641,5.173076923076923

6960205,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Reese Witherspoon movies can vary, IMHO.  In some roles (like June Carter in ""Walk the Line""), she is transcendent. This, likewise, is one of her great roles.  The story is fairly ""basic"" -- a troubled woman tries to make peace with herself and her life by taking a long solo trek through the wilderness.  It's what happens ""between the lines"" that makes this film meaningful -- through expressions and gestures, Reese fully conveys the pain and complexity of this woman.  She is totally ""real,"" you forget that you are watching ""Reese.""  She is Cheryl Strayed, and you will stay with her every step of the way!",1453939200,,611,4.726415094339623
6960206,5,B00S6MBGY8,Great read... Could not put down... 5 stars,1453939200,,43,4.5
6960207,1,B00S6MBGY8,"Anyone who can ascribe the least amount of credulity to this film...or the book upon which it is based for that matter...deserves to be sentenced to watch it in its entirety.  Come on you folks!!!  Your readers and/ or viewers are not dumb enough to buy any of this inane garbage.  Looks like Cheryl Strayed pulled a fast, ""we feel your pain"" con job on the producers as well as her readers.  Sorry, but we who read and observe critically are not that naive.",1453852800,2,458,4.416666666666667
6960208,3,B00S6MBGY8,"The best word to describe this movie is ""EH.""  I mean, it wasn't awful - and yet....it certainly would never be one of my favorites.

The Plot:  A woman by the name of Cheryl Strayed (played by Reece Witherspoon) sets off to hike the Pacific Coast trail to walk off her grief after losing her beloved mom to cancer.  She also needs to ""find herself"" after the dissolution of her marriage - due to her own drug abusive ways and many infidelities.

My Take:  The movie is riddled with endless depressing flashbacks of her crumbling life.....but this wasn't the worst thing about the movie.  What I didn't like, was how unbelievably dumb this person was to just set out by herself with no knowledge of how to handle yourself in the wilderness - and all by herself, no less.  Naturally, she runs into some very predatory men (I won't tell any more about these men, since that would create a spoiler alert!)...

.But where was the cougar?  I thought for sure there would be one!  Actually, the ""wild"" in this movie did not seem very wild, at all....except for one lonely old rattlesnake shoved in.  And why was Cheryl's ex-husband sending her boxes of goodies with loving little notes attached that she collected along the way?  Does that even make any sense?

Another aspect of the movie that didn't sit well with me, was that Cheryl seemed so....aimless.  She didn't have any goals in life --- and wait?  Doesn't she have two children?  She did not seem like a mom at all in this movie...not contact with her kids...I mean, isn't that weird?  I thought so.  At the end of the movie, there is this weird philosophical utterance that seems completely out of place and doesn't even make much sense.

Bottom Line:  This movie is okay to watch ONCE...but that's it.  I'm not completely sorry I saw this movie...but I certainly would never watch it again.  There's really no point....just like the plot, itself!  My advice....do a Pay Per View for this movie or buy...... only if you can get it really cheap in a 5 dollar bin, or used!",1453766400,,2026,4.563888888888889

6960210,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Based on the book which I read and reviewed previously. One who has walked for a living and gone backpacking finds this gal's navet&eacute; incredible. As usual the movie needs must leave out much detail included in the book or shows it in passing. Telling a story in flashback rather than in narrative fashion seems to be the current vogue. The star of the show is the Pacific Coast Trail and time plus financial constraints limits the  capture of the scenery in all its moods particularly what must have been glorious sunrises and sunsets, the stars at night, and moonscapes. In the end this movie is not about the trail but the author's subjective journey. My Welsh friend accuses her of being a whinger. This is the second movie in which I've seen Laura Dorn portrait dying onscreen, she did so in October Sky.",1453680000,,814,4.652777777777778

6960214,5,B00S6MBGY8,"If one views this as a crucifixion story where our culture so degraded purposefully by a sub group in control of electronic dramas where, a good young women descends into extreme carnality in reaction to her Mother's Love and her Mother's own victim-hood  by the same processes... and then the daughter's journey back to the spirit, to deliverance back into a spiritual life... then WILD ... goes over the threshold of very good movie making... into great art.

Simply made, in fact the cinematography is not particularly notable, I think to keep the story in the young women's head mostly.

To say this is a departure for Reese Witherspoon is understatement. She is wonderful here and given at times the raw subject and some scenes she allows herself to be used for in the higher purpose of spiritual inquiry...  she deserves admiration. Her acting is more raw than obviously good and yet she exactly portrays the character.

As most of us know, the screen image psychically... of a movie actress is extremely important to career and can easily affect the public's perception forever. Reese has been a big movie star for so long now that she can choose to risk for art's sake.

This is a deep deep movie. If one loves hiking and the outdoors then, her trials are familiar and anticipated and sometimes very funny. I have not read the book but I am considering it.",1453507200,,1364,4.7100840336134455

The Trail, which I know well, was at best a footnote but never a clear metaphor for Cheryl's journey.

6960241,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Reese Whiterspoon stars as Cheryl Strayed in the film version of the acclaimed road memoir about a woman at a crossroads after losing her mother to cancer and who sets to hike the Pacific Crest trail without any prior hiking experience.
Wild is a long road trip about a woman about to find herself and although we know that she will change at the end of the trip, the movie itself has many incidents which make us want to complete this hike with Strayed. Grief does strange things to people and Strayed is completely devastated when her mother succumbs to cancer. She embarks on a path of self abuse, which leads her to find the person in her that her mother truly wanted her to be.
Wild is a very scenic trial and has been directed very well by Jean-Marc Vallee and is a decent film but I found it just OK as a road movie. Release date: December 3rd, 2014",1451692800,,856,4.3229813664596275
6960242,2,B00S6MBGY8,"I am floored that people refer to the original person this is about as a 'heroine' and 'likeable' in the reviews.
This might be a spoiler alert so proceed with caution:
The lead 'lady' is someone with mommy/daddy issues yet lucky enough to have a stable job, friends, and a faithful, caring husband.
So what does she do? Starts using hard drugs (and sleeping with the other user of course), screws every guy that looks her way (even goes out of her way for illicit affairs by hanging out in hotel bars to hook up with strangers) , screws the customers at her job, tells her friend that she is preggo yet doesn't know the dad from all the affairs she's had (so she has to terminate pregnancy) and when she wants to go on a 'spiritual journey' of sorts - oh, THEN she needs her supportive husband to send care packages and other things she needs all the while screwing hippies she meets along her trek.
Does she feel remorse or guilt by the end of the trail? Nope - just chalks it up to ""I am woman hear me roar"" and ""oh, this is just all a learning experience"" never the mind the personal relationships she has betrayed and ruined along the way. The fact that this person is considered a hero in anyone's mind is mindboggling.
I was ashamed and embarrassed for the lead role by the end of the film. The movie makes her out to be an independent pioneer of sorts when all the while she made no attempt to rationalize how her decisions have impacted the loved ones that were there for her in the first place.",1451692800,,1504,4.318021201413427

It's a fabulous story about finding yourself, overcoming obstacles, challenging yourself and finding that you've healed your soul along the way.  Cheryl Strayed shows the true strength of the human spirit and its ability to rise above grief and your own limitations, even and especially those you placed upon yourself by making some of the worst mistakes a person can do.

6960257,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Disappointed but perhaps it was over-hyped. Nothing in particular to fault with Reese Witherspoon's acting. I am sure she followed the instructions to the letter. I will say that other reviewer's have mentioned not finding inspiration in her character and I too was not inspired by the whininess and self-destruction. I know it's a story about loss and grief and how this woman came through the other side but there were so many cliched portions of the plot regarding women and men that a quarter of the way in I began trying to guess what the next one would be. Then at 1:41 an expected but nonetheless disappointing event and I threw in the towel, wondering why I'd hung in there hoping to identify with a woman who'd lost her parent and was simultaneously self-imploding and rebuilding herself via flashback sequences and periods of ""Here is where Cheryl learns how to...""
I did enjoy Laura Dern's work in the movie. She's one who has stayed true to herself but managed to bring something new from outside herself to each role she took on. I don't see this so much in Reese Witherspoon. It seems that she is simply acting HARDER in each movie. I expected more. I don't even want to watch the last 10 minutes, which are probably the most important. Bummer.",1450569600,,1258,4.645739910313901

6960259,5,B00S6MBGY8,"This was just an amazing movie.  Reese Witherspoon gives a profound performance.  I see a lot of the reviews here and on IMDB are hot and cold on this movie.  Well, I think there is a good reason.  If you have not had any interpersonal relationship strife in your life you might completely misunderstand this movie.  I am not saying it is a requirement to understand the movie, but I strongly suspect the reason some people don't really like this movie is because they can't relate to the reaction Cheryl (Reese Witherspoon) has to events that take place in her life.  Obviously, not all people would take it anywhere near this extreme, but I understand what Cheryl was doing.

I'll say it like this a lot of us have issues in our lives.  Some bigger than others.  Some handle it well and others have to push through their issues with more work.  What I loved about this movie is that instead of sitting and pouting about life.  Cheryl goes out and tries to force a change in her life.  Her journey is quite powerful and I found it profoundly moving.  I highly recommend you see this movie, if you like immersion stories.  Ones that really delve into a character and how they feel.  Even if you can't personal relate to Cheryl.  Maybe consider that you are getting to see quite far into someone else's point of view.  Something I love in a story and really liked about this movie.  I found it life changing.

The message of the movie is to let go of emotional baggage.  To be free to make decisions that will broaden your life.  I think far too many people are getting caught up in the actions of the character when she was down.  Look at where she ends up.  Life is a journey and I think it's a very valuable lesson to be learned here.  Think of how many people just live hum drum lives and never challenge themselves.  They never act up but they never really live.  I don't recommend people set out to live the beginning of her life.  I do however recommend that people in trouble or in doubt consider the lesson in this story. I loved it.

On a side note:  Why are people comparing this to Into the Wild??  I find that just inaccurate.  I can't stand Into the Wild.  Christopher McCandless' story is completely different.  Cheryl does this to grow.  She has an end game.  She has supplies and food.  A plan to stay in touch with friends.  She has some money.  She's not running away she's learning to live her life.  I felt that McCandless lack of planning and lining up resources was just plain unwise.  The outcomes of the story prove my point.  McCandless seeks adventure but has no realistic plan to end his journey or successfully survive.  I don't what anyone could learn from his story.  Since, most people know not to make his decisions.

Anyway I don't see a connection between those films.  I think this story is far more inspiring.  I hope Reese wins an Oscar.",1450310400,,2874,4.429942418426104

6960280,3,B00S6MBGY8,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

What happens when you match a talented director such as Jean-Marc Valle (responsible for the very fine ""Dallas Buyers Club"") and the bathetic screenwriter Nick Hornby (known for the lame ""An Education"" and recent soap opera ""Brooklyn"")? The answer is: a mixed bag! That's exactly what ""Wild"" appears to be. Hornby's script is based on Cheryl Strayed's 2012 memoir Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail. It stars Reese Witherspoon who probably wanted to play an edgier role in contrast to some of her earlier efforts where she's been pegged as more of an All-American girl type.

Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed who took a journey of self-discovery, hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail without prior experience. Strayed's life had practically fallen apart after the death of her mother from cancer a few years earlier, her subsequent use of drugs (heroin in particular), and divorce from her husband due to her self-destructive behavior. The film is split into scenes featuring her foray into the wilderness and flashbacks chronicling her difficult earlier years.

Undoubtedly the more compelling half of the film is when we're with Witherspoon as she hikes (carrying a super heavy backpack) into the Wilderness. There is always an element of danger for our protagonist, not only from the natural world (Cheryl avoids a rattlesnake in one instance) but also faces the fear and threat of sexual assault from a few different men she encounters.

During her first encounter, Cheryl finds a gun inside a pickup truck belonging to a construction worker who offers her a ride back to his home for a shower and a cooked meal. It turns out that the guy is married and quite benign. More interesting events occur including a camper who helps Cheryl lighten the load on her backpack and advises her on how she can order a new pair of boots and have then delivered to the next way station.

More obstacles are put in Cheryl's way which she must overcome. After removing her boot to remove a loose toenail, she loses one of the boots as it falls down the side of a mountain. Now she must improvise by wearing sandals covered with duct tape.

The tension mounts when Cheryl almost runs out of water and then meets two hunters, one of whom appears to have a desire to sexually assault her. Again nothing bad really happens and she leaves the trail for a short respite in Ashland, Oregon, where she meets a nice guy named Jonathan (they attend a concert and then spend the night together).

The denouement is touching as Cheryl encounters a llama that had got loose from a young boy and his grandmother. After Cheryl mentions that her mother had died, the boy sings ""Red River Valley"" which affects her greatly. The second appearance of a red fox may be linked to the spirit of her mother, who is the catalyst for her recovery.

As I said, the wilderness part of Wild is the good part but unfortunately the flashbacks involving Cheryl's earlier life prove to be much less compelling. What's missing here is character development instead we almost have a group of generic family members: The mother dying of cancer and an abusive dad from even earlier days. The sympathetic husband is a bit of a twist but he's there only to support Cheryl as she falls into a generic drug haze.

In the end, ignore all the angst and focus on Cheryl's fascinating trek on the dazzling Pacific Crest Trail.",1448928000,,3426,4.754208754208754

Finding myself with nothing to do on a dreary afternoon I watched this movie and really enjoyed it.  Reese turns in a remarkable performance and is very believable in the role (I didn't think she would pull it off).  The flashbacks draw you into the movie, and while some are predictable the performances are great and when you cut back to the trail you are left wanting to know more.

The movie was hard to follow, didn't project the books wonderful humor/writing style/imagery, and many of the book details that made it a very rich story for me, were removed.  Such as how hard the hike was, the timeline was scattered, and why she might have been able to do this hike based on her upbringing.  Yes, I understand all details can't and don't translate well to a movie, but I was very confused while watching the movie.  Others who didn't read the book watched the Movie with me, and also were confused why I raved about the book. My lesson.  When I like a book, don't watch the movie.

6960358,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Witherspoon's character is very unlikable and doesn't seem to really go through any growth or change by the end of the movie. At the end, the monologue kind of comes out of nowhere and the dots don't really connect. I had no idea before seeing the movie that this is the same director as Dallas Buyer's Club. That story and film are much better.

After intravenous drug use, cheating on her husband multiple times with multiple partners, and basically treating her mother like crap until the day she dies, I found it difficult to believe that this hike turned it all around. At least that is how it is portrayed in the film. I am not doubting the real life story which this is based upon but the film does not seem very successful in portraying it or making the character out to anything more than a mean spirited person. I realize that flashbacks have to be used to tell the back story but they occurred too often and it became annoying going back and forth between the past and present constantly.

In my opinion, this movie tries to be very much like Into The Wild starring Emile Hirsch except not good. That movie is much more successful in telling a story and getting real empathy from the viewer. I realize they are different stories however a lot same basic themes apply; including self growth. Not sure what all the rave reviews are about....",1444608000,,1350,4.528688524590164

She just doesn't have that rugged, adventurous quality that was necessary for this role.

6960392,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed, a real-life woman who, having lost her mother (Laura Dern) and ruined her marriage, embarks on an 1100-mile solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail while having no previous experience with outdoor skills. Nick Hornby, British writer of such books as High Fidelity and About a Boy, turned her bestselling memoirs into a script.

The story of self-discovery through a long (and often grueling) journey is a pretty familiar topic for cinema. In fact, it could be anywhere, like in West Australia (as in Tracks starring Mia Wasikowska). Wild never goes into details as to what compels her to continue her journey, but Witherspoons strong performance convinces us of the heroines willpower, if not motive.

The film works best as a showcase for the talent of Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern, both Oscar nominated for the roles they play here, but as to the characters they portray, you may not be impressed as much as their acting. Hornbys screenplay frequently employs flashbacks, in which Cheryls troubled past is shown, but except one touching scene where Laura Dern speaks of her life, scenes are too fragmentary for us to emotionally invest.

Perhaps this is because of the style of Canadian director Jean-Marc Valle, who is known for Dallas Buyers Club, another film based on a real-life story. Valle is a kind of filmmaker who relies more on the leading actors realistic performance than on camerawork or narrative skills, to further the story, and Wild is no exception.

Thus Wild is about the personal redemption of the heroine, but is vague about how she won it. With brief but interesting interactions with men she encounters along the trail, the film is more like a character study and works as such, but whether you find her trek attractive or not is another matter.",1443139200,,1812,4.9311475409836065

If you believe in a higher meaning of life, i.e. religion or serving others, this is not the movie for you. In watching this movie, one is welcomed into a person's effort to reorient their life and deal with their issues by hiking in the wild. It provides a beautiful set of pictures, and is fast paced and not boring. The character engages in various acts which you may or may not agree with. All these things I can appreciate. What I found wanting it the fact that it is all this movie is, a woman hiking in the woods. There was not any revelation about the meaning of life, just a person dealing with life. That is not entertain to me, but rather just stressful. That is not what I want from a movie. I have a stressful job, and I want a few moments to escape from the stress. This movie did not provide that, and as a result, I have little use for it.

6960410,1,B00S6MBGY8,"An actress like Reese Witherspoon can be a draw for seeing a movie. However, I think she made a poor choice in choosing this role. I wouldn't want to play someone who was such a mess. I only got halfway through this and couldn't go on. I wanted to skip to the end to see if there was some amazing ending that would redeem the movie but it was on tv so I couldn't skip ahead. If I were Reese Witherspoon I wouldn't want my children to see this movie ever. She shouldn't be proud of this one. I thought this would really be more about her hike but it switched back so much to her memories, and the focus wasn't enough on the hike and it's impact. I never got to a part in the movie where it seemed to have an impact on changing her as a person. She had been cheating on her husband with strangers and it resulted in a divorce. It showed her memories of having sex with strangers and using drugs. Perhaps if I had stuck with the movie I wouldn't have gotten the point of why this was in the movie but I never did. This isn't what I want to see in a movie. What's the point? I hope Reese makes better choices in roles in the future.",1442448000,3,1128,3.995575221238938

6960414,5,B00S6MBGY8,"The scenery in this movie was beautiful but it was the story that I found riveting. Reese's portrayal of Chery Grey/Strays life is absolutely convincing and I think one of her best performances. The movie is based on a true story so there are a few scenes that portray how Cheryl fell into a destructive life after the death of her mother.

After hitting rock bottom and desperate to make a huge change in her life Cheryl got a big backpack and gear and loaded herself down and set off to hike the Pacific Crest Trail ""PCT"". She had no hiking or camping experience but had a lot of determination. She makes friends along the trail that help her (this is where I personally identified with her story because our family experienced the same thing and wonderful friendships made along the way).

Her goal was simple to say but not so easy to do--to find herself again, to become the woman she knew she was meant to be. Also the be the woman her mother raised her to be.

As Cheryl hikes she has a lot of time to be introspective and we flashback to the events of her past which show us her relationship with her mother and how she ran off the rails and hit rock bottom after her mother's death. These moments when she reflected on her past memories helped me identify with who she was, how she was brought up, her tremendous struggle and who she could be if she was successful in rediscovering herself.

I enjoyed the movie so much I have bought the book so I can read more detail about her experience.",1442188800,,1499,4.362007168458781
6960415,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Reese Witherspoon was a great choice for Cheryl Strayed, however the film lacked something that made it cohesive.  I feel like the emotional struggles that Cheryl experienced could have been described with more intensity, and the feelings of being in the wild alone, as a woman.  I was hoping for a poignant film such as this to take on the characteristics of ""Into the Wild"".  Instead, the film lacked the inner dialogue that I was hoping for.  I should have rented it first.  I wish this would have earned a place in my permanent library, instead I'll probably forget about it eventually.",1442188800,,590,4.745098039215686

I've created my own specially designed ultralight backpack with everything from sweat wicking shirts to a Lexen GP27 Juicer. You'd be surprised how much survival you can pack in 30 lbs of gear. When I watched this movie it took me to where I imagine to be once I give up on having a relationship. My alternate path. I really like the way it plays out, but in reality, whats the use of getting away from the world, and the problems you are having only to make it all the way to Oregon and sleep with some guy after most of the trip is through? I really thought a few things like that was ODD, but I really don't have the right to judge this girls heart either.

I guess all of us who have found ourselves lost in life would like to have taken these steps and it is inspirational to see the story of the woman who did it.  She doesn't make excuses for her mistakes in life, she doesn't ask for forgiveness, and she doesn't ask anyone to feel sorry for her.  She just wants to find herself and try to mend her broken life after the death of her mother.

6960446,5,B00S6MBGY8,"This is an amazing story about a young woman needing a change in her troubled life.  She needed a change within herself and went on a modern day walk-a-bout on the Pacific Crest Trail as a way of self-discovery and healing.  She hiked 1,100 miles from the Mojave Desert to a place on the Oregon-Washington border called Bridge of the Gods.  Completely inexperienced in hiking and this sort of trek, Cheryl Strayed struggles through the physical, logistical and mental challenges of this long hike.  Through her memories during the hike, we see her mother's death and the impact it had on her.  We see her grief and her acting out by shooting heroin and excessive cheating on her first husband.  We see her downward spiral.

As she is remembering these painful experiences, we also see her transforming into someone quite amazing.  That amazing person was always there, but temporarily buried by the pain and grief.

I can't imagine the courage it took to do what she did.  I only know it took tremendous courage and extreme willpower to keep going.

Cheryl Strayed's story is an amazing story, and Reese Witherspoon played her beautifully.

I highly recommend the movie.  It is full of Adult content, so may not be fitting for children.",1441584000,,1236,4.800947867298579

Cheryl Strayed is imho sort of an unsympathetic hero and the reason her work gets so much press is all the other losers who read it and want to believe that a hike can heal them from their selfishness.  I was unprepared for a story about a nature hike with the hero being a junkie. promiscuous, and selfish.  She is an impulsive person and a lot of the problems she encounters in this movie are entirely due to her. She triumphs over them because she is pretty and people help her.  It is also kind of annoying that her grief is such a ""big"" thing. My mom died in a similar way to her's and I got up the next week and went to work. Cause I am an adult with bills to pay. That was the the hard way. It would have been easy to just self destruct and then go on a hike until I felt better. .",1441497600,,875,4.017241379310345

6960495,5,B00S6MBGY8,I loved the movie. Very real moments captured on screen. It kept both of our interest through to the end. I have thought back on certain scenes since watching and a lot of moments were eye opening. Two scenes were favs. The one the child she meets sings and the one her mother is reflecting on never getting to be her ... Always living her life as a mother or wife and just finally getting to a place of her own and the tragedy of that thought with all that was taking place.,1440979200,,475,4.118279569892473

6960497,4,B00S6MBGY8,Loved the story...we can all identify in some way with this young lady. Our lives have all had a time where we felt we needed to get away and find our own truth. My only complaint is the audio is terrible. Most of the time when the main character is reciting something or reliving a life event you cannot hear what is being said. Then when she is in town or talking with another person the sound comes up and you have to turn it down. I had to have the remote in hand through the whole movie. It was very frustrating. I probably missed 25% or more of the dialog because of the erratic audio.,1440979200,,591,4.103448275862069

If I were the director of the film, I would have started the scenes both the good (her remarkable mother) and the reckless (the drugs, and sex) at the first part of the movie to get them over with and to set the stage for the long hike.  Then move on to the natural and appealing Appalachian trail experiences, so the viewer was over the reason why she took to the AT, and the rest of the movie could be her renascence.  Each time the walk on the trail was interrupted by past episodes of her life, it took me away from natures natural healing, and interrupted the enjoyment of the movie.  .",1439769600,,711,4.404580152671755

The problem i had was that they didn't sell the idea that Cheryl was a drug and sex addict whos mother had passed away or that she  was scraping the bottom. There were fleeting references to having sex with strangers and some drug use but it seemed mild. It would have built the story and her ultimate decision to hike the PTC by delving into the losses of her mother and marriage as well as her recklessness so the viewer understood how broken and lost she was PRIOR to doing the hike.",1439683200,,573,4.305555555555555

6960600,5,B00S6MBGY8,"I read the book first, and it is so good that I did not possibly think the movie could satisfy me at all the same way.  It wasn't the same way, but even though it was necessary for the writer and producers to leave out some of the book, they managed to make a beautiful, engaging movie, with an absolutely brilliant job of portraying Cheryl Strayed by Reese Witherspoon.  It was indeed satisfying, and I did something I haven't done in years now--I cried at the end.  The triumph of her trip was part of my emotional reaction, that she had visually shown us coming through trial by fire, in this case, extreme physical struggle.  Most of us do not think of confronting emotional and psychological problems by enduring such physical hardship; we think of the therapist's couch.  Not only that, a lot of us don't have the physical stamina to do it.  After reading the book, I wasn't sure that Reese Witherspoon looked like a person who could do that.  But she was convincing in every possible way.  Another hit for Reese--is this really the same actor who gave us the enduring Legally Blonde (I insist that my granddaughter watch it at least once a year!)?  I'm adding Wild to her list.

6960605,4,B00S6MBGY8,I liked this movie because of all of the trail stuff plus Reese Witherspoon is just awesome anyways. It's not boring because of her thinking back on her life while she's walking and how she just realizes and faces things in her life. I personally liked the movie.

6960622,4,B00S6MBGY8,"I was initially not very interested in watching this movie. I read the book and found Cheryl Strayed annoying and hard to like as a narrator. However, I really liked the movie!!  The scenery was a amazing.  Obviously that was missing from the book.  Reese Witherspoon seemed more likeable and sympathetic than Strayed - which is also odd because she does a lot of unlikeable things. I thought the flashback story telling was done well and Laura Dern was simply fantastic! You could imagine falling into a pit of despair if you lost a mother like that. Although if you didn't read the book, I could see that it would be hard to follow early in the movie.  My daughter's comments after the movie was, ""I'd be afraid the entire time that some men would kill or hurt me.""  I don't think that men have that thought watching this movie. Indeed, my husband said, ""What about mountain lions? I would worry about that or a bear."" If that kind of thought process following the movie makes it a ""chick flick"" um, okay...I guess. But I wouldn't call it that ever.  Fantastic soundtrack!",1439510400,,1074,4.567708333333333

6960629,5,B00S6MBGY8,"One of the  best movies that I have seen in a long time. Reese Witherspoon did an outstanding job. This movie had beautiful scenery as well. I think it goes to show us that despite the negatives that have happened in our lives, we can do something to give us a positive perspective. We can overcome the pain of our past and make our present and futures brighter and full of hope. It lets us know that we can always reflect on the negative events of our past, but we don not have to let those events haunt us anymore. It is about moving on and letting go. It is about telling the bad things in our lives, ""You are not going to control me anymore."" It also shows determination about not giving up. A person who set out to do something that she was inexperienced  with stayed with it until the end despite numerous obstacles in her way. I highly recommend this movie to everybody.",1439424000,,877,4.27710843373494

6960642,1,B00S6MBGY8,I'm certain the book was much better although I didn't  read it. I adore Reese Witherspoon but this movie was a bad choice. I understand that this movie is supposed to delve deeper into the inner thoughts and feelings of this character but it wasn't enough to become invested. It took 2 days to watch the movie because I found a movie all about hiking/walking very boring.

6960683,4,B00S6MBGY8,I enjoyed this movie but wouldn't watch it a second time.  My favorite part was when Cheryl (Reese) first packed for her trip with no preparation or knowledge of what she was getting herself into.  Of course one should always test equipment such as cooking devices and understand how to use them before hitting a trail.  You should not be reading the instruction manual when you already are in the thick of it or you will have already lost the war before it's even started.  Although the story was about adventure I wasn't really all that invested in the story line as the movie went on.

6960697,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Cheryl Strayed's 2012 memoir Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail is adapted for this film that tells the story of a woman who went on a thousand miles of hiking to overcome many things in her life such as her divorce,mother's death and many years of destructive behaviors that included drugs,alcohol and sex.

Reese Witherspoon starred in the film as Cheryl together with Laura Dern,who portrayed as her mother. The film written by Nick Hornby and directed by Jean-Marc Valle goes through the events of Cheryl's life as well as the challenges she overcame during the hike considering her lack of experience. It ends when she reached the end of her destination at the so-called ""Bridge Of The Gods"" wherein she started a new life with a new family and children.

This is definitely an emotional and powerful film about a woman who wanted to attain change in her life. Many viewers will find it to resonate in their lives especially during these tough times in the country. Added to that,it will also be inspiring for many people especially who have gone through difficulties in life like Cheryl and will find her a role model especially when it comes to living a better life.",1438819200,,1190,4.716346153846154

However, the movie just does not do justice to Cheryl Strayed's recount of her time spent hiking the PCT and what lead her to do so. Don't get me wrong, Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern give excellent performances. The movie is slow paced, andsadly leaves out a good portion of the book that is integral to the story as a whole.

6960726,5,B00S6MBGY8,"We loved this movie.  Reese Witherspoon pulled this one off almost single handedly.  I couldn't help but notice there are a few really negative ratings on this movie, but I really don't understand why.  It was a well acted story of a woman who didn't have a very good start in life, and had thoroughly ruined the rest of it.  At her lowest point she decides to do something she had never tried before in her life.  There is not a lot of dialog in the movie, since she is making her trek alone (which, by the way, would have to take a lot of bravery or a lot of stupidity, and I'm not exactly sure which it was).  Her character was not very likable, but since when do all movie characters have to be good guys for it to be a very good movie?  Granted it was totally different from any of her other movies, but most actors want to get away from the types of movies that they started out with and expand upon their character acting.  She did a fabulous job.",1438560000,,954,4.146739130434782

6960728,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Nice job by Reese Witherspoon - definitely Oscar performance - almost a one woman show - the family history flashback stuff was often either precious or shrill but overall a good  movie.

Good tension with the events and people on the trail, for me would have been just as good - maybe better - without the flash backs.",1438473600,,412,4.694444444444445
6960729,2,B00S6MBGY8,"I expected way more.  It was a typical ""find yourself"" type movie:  Woman experiences a tragic event, she goes out to find herself, she encounters all the expected obstacles, and in the end she finds peace.  I don't think that's a spoiler because how else could it end? No surprises.  I gave it two stars instead of one because it was a tiny bit interesting to see what it might be like to hike the PCT.  However, I kept checking the time to see if it was almost over.",1438387200,,468,4.213483146067416

Then she just runs away from life (and her responsibilities) and goes walking out in the wilderness to rebalance her life.  So what?  A lot of people have hard lives, but they don't use their pain to hurt others.  Many who watch this will say it's a story of redemption, but that viewpoint conveniently forgets (or ignores) the destruction she left in her wake.  What about the other people?  It's supposedly based on a true story?  Ok, well this is a person's life that we should not admire.  And since I'm on my soapbox with this one, I'll hazard a guess that it's attitudes like this girl's, which spur people on to commit heinous crimes against innocents because ""they're in pain.""  This girl didn't kill anyone, but she is not honest with herself about the emotional pain she inflicted.  Reese is beautiful, as always, but this movie stinks.

6960851,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Brilliant performance by Reese Witherspoon who plays Cheryl, not the brightest woman in the world who sets out on a long hike with way more stuff in her backpack than she needs. Cheryl has never even put her tent up in her backyard, or used her stove and other equipment, let alone done a short overnight trip or two before setting out on an epic hike. It is of no surprise of course that she has a lot of difficulties along the way and relies on others she comes across for help and advice such as get rid of most of stuff in your pack, wear shoes that are your size and not too small. Granted the real life Cheryl doesn't have Witherspoon's looks, but you do wonder if she would have made it as far as she did if she wasn't young and blonde as she also seems to get a lot of extra help from those she comes across due to being so, which is commented on by other hikers who get none.

The movie is more about the former pre walk life of Cheryl and the hardships and downward spiral (drugs and sleeping with anyone who asks) life that got worse when her mother passed away, than it is about the hike. We don't see a great amount of the trail but we do see some nice scenery. I did think the film ended rather abruptly, I thought she was walking to Canada from the Mexican border but she just stops at a bridge in Portland without explanation of why this decision was made.

The DVD comes with a lot of three minute or so extras, although granted a lot of them use the same footage and interviews. In that we learn all of the real Cheryl's family appeared in the movie including herself, and her daughter who played the younger Cheryl. We learn of the hardships of filming and that some of the trail wasn't shot on it due to respecting the pristineness of the place. We meet the real life Greg (I think that was his name, the first fellow hiker she comes across). I found the extras quite interesting although I never understand why they don't edit these things so they repeat the same interviews they've shown in other ones.

A lot of people compare Wild to the film Into the Wild, other than both main characters stupidly not preparing and researching how to do something that can kill you if you don't respect it, they are pretty different films. The Way with Martin Sheen probably would be more similar to this one with a solo out of depth first time long walker on an epic journey as a way to deal with loss of family member (son in that case).",1437264000,,2448,4.237687366167023

Some items regarding her hike, she planned quite well, but other Items she planned very poorly, yet she survived to tell the story.

The movie was pretty good, and quite true to the book, which I also read, but I would have preferred them filming it In California and Oregon, not just in Oregon.  Only a very brief section was actually filmed in California at the very beginning of the movie.

This is a quintessential American adventure.

6960891,3,B00S6MBGY8,"This film is made based on the novel written by a woman who experienced long track up Pacific Coast on her own.  Personally, I find it admirable when women travel alone without any companions, but when they do it in a wild with their backpack - it gives a whole new dimension to searching for one's own self.

The main protagonist is faced with having to accept a loss of her mother.  It is understandable how difficult that loss is when we learn that a man her mother was married to was abusive alcoholic who emotionally and physically abused both his wife and his own two children.  Protagonists mother finally leaves her abusive husband, gets divorced and starts a new life that includes her attending the same college her daughter is going to.  Other than love for each other this three persons family has not much.  Money is sparse, life is not easy but they enjoy every moment of their life together, until cancer strikes.  It is difficult for anyone to accept the loss of a parent, but when a parents gets sick and dies at the moment in their lives when they are finally free and happy than acceptance of a loss becomes even harder.  So rather than accepting, it is so much easier to look for escape in anything and anyone who can aliviate the enormous grief, sadness and sometimes even anger.

One day, heroine realizes that she cannot go on with her life as it was.  She is in a marriage that is not making her happy and emotional pain is dulled with drugs and as many sexual partners as possible.  Eventually, she chooses to go walk the Pacific Trail, thousands of miles of it on her own in attempt to reconcile her emotions and find inner peace.

Recently I read a book with a similar topic ""Walking Home"" written by Chicago's author Sonia Choquette.  Sonia completed her walk in Spain, also on her own in order to reconcile the loss of her father and her brother and slow but certain meltdown of her marriage. What both women would agree on is that solitude and nature can have healing and profound power on how we look at the world and ourselves.  Thousands of miles of hiking alone, leaves person with plenty of time for reflection and self reliance becomes a tool for survivor.  Although I love hiking, I like to do it in moderation.  Recently I have been walking various portions of the Appalachian Trails but I always stay cabins, close to the water (lake or a stream) because (as I was told) I am spoiled and like to sleep in a warm bed and have shelter over my head so I do not get eaten by a bear or bitten by a snake. I find nature just as healing in moderation if not more.  I am able to exercise, eat healthy, reflect, write, read, have local restaurant prepare food and meditate.  I like my feet and legs and use them for yoga practice.  I find loosing toenails less appealing.... And the results are just as profound.",1436918400,5,2842,4.430769230769231

It's as bad as Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Cheryl Strayed makes it to be.  Witherspoon is not a very stoic looking girl but she makes you cheer for her as she goes on her journey and begins to slowly but surely heal from loss, drug abuse, and failed relationships.  The cinematography is splendid and breathtaking and makes you feel that you are on the journey with her.",1436745600,,475,4.7560975609756095

I thoroughly enjoyed Strayeds excellent memoir of this title and the film does it justice.  Her mothers death threw Strayed into a tailspin involving heroin addiction and meaningless sex.  With no serious hiking experience, she made a somewhat desperate decision to hike the trail and her stubborn determination kept her going in spite of a naive lack of appropriate preparation.  This is one of the more profound and life-affirming films this year.  My personal advice is to skip Birdman, Foxcatcher, and Whiplash and see Wild instead.",1436745600,,623,5.128712871287129

6960950,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Yes Reese was very very good,...but unfortunately I didn't think nearly as much of the movie.  It just seemed like a glossed-over version of the story.  For example, Reese's body odor was referred to several times, but her hair always looked clean.  Most people don't have hair that looks that good even when they're not hiking thousands of miles.  Also - while the movie shows occasional flashes of what I'm assuming are meant to be pieces of perspective - ie Reese the waitress having sex in the alley, Reese arguing with her husband, Reese devolving into drugs - and ultimately the death of her mom - I just never got the connection between all of this and what really made her start hiking in the first place. Was she - as she mentioned once - trying to become the person her mother thought she would?  That's it?  I guess it was ultimately a journey about - finding herself - but the risk/reward of the endeavor wound up being lost on me.",1436486400,2,943,4.485380116959064

6960964,4,B00S6MBGY8,I have read the book and thought the movie would not be as good but I enjoyed it very much.  The book expanded more on what prompted Cheryl to strike out on her quest.  For someone who has not read the book the flashbacks during the movie might have been a hard way to piece that early history together.  Cheryl's adventure was wreckless and she was extremely fortunate to finish the trail without serious injury.  I would hope her story would not cause other women to put themselves in such danger.

The type of journey that Cheryl Strayed so honestly and beautifully describes in print is tough to translate to film.  Feelings of grief, desperation, self loathing, loneliness, sexuality, love - these are not exactly the car chases and champagne discos that Hollywood is so fond of.  But, Reese Witherspoon as the Star and Producer of this film does a wonderful job of bringing the story to life.

I also find it exciting that Ms. Witherspoon is taking a more active role as a Producer and working with other high powered Women in Hollywood to bring other compelling stories about Women to the screen.

6961000,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Reese Witherspoon has always been one of my favorite actors. However, there have only been a few occasions where I believed she was able to truly show the full extent of her talent. I forced myself to hold out on watching this movie until I finished the equally incredible book. After finally finding the time to finish it, I watched this movie on the same day.

I was so impressed. This movie is beautiful and unapologetic--just like the book. Reese plays the central character perfectly and the scenery is equally as important to this fascinating story of redemption.",1436313600,,569,4.8061224489795915
6961001,2,B00S6MBGY8,This movie seems to get lost on the trail. The main character doesn't grow along her walk. It just tells the story of how bad a person she is and at the end of her walk you feel she just travelled the distance of the trail but didn't change that much along the way. The scenery was ok. The flashbacks tell of her relationship with her mother but not to the point you feel any connection with any of the characters at all. Just not that great!,1436313600,,442,4.091954022988506

6961004,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Not what I was expecting. Reese Witherspoon is down-to-earth as a very troubled young lady who decides to try to straighten herself out by hiking the Pacific Rim Trail. Based on a true story, it's done in flashback style, bouncing back and forth between the hike and the woman's messed up life that led her to that point. Just doesn't quite pack the emotional punch that I think it had the potential to achieve because Reese's character is hard to like. The bonus features are as good as the movie, as they provide a lot of background about the Trail and the woman who actually hiked it alone.",1436313600,,593,4.5

6961006,3,B00S6MBGY8,"As a book nerd, I so appreciate how the director stayed true to the book by Cheryl Strayed. I didn't feel like anything substantial was left out although there were obviously some changes. I was wondering how they were going to create a movie based on a book with one character, but they did it quite well through Reese's inner-narration and the flashbacks. However, I just wasn't as intrigued with the movie as I was with the book. I can't put my finger why the book was such an easy read because I'm not a hiker and every time I explain the concept to people, it sounds like a boring book, but Cheryl Strayed presents her story in such an enthralling way that it's hard to put the book down.

It's not a suspense filled drama, but it feels like it, especially at certain times in the movie.  It's not a heartbreaker either, but you do sympathize.  It's a lot of things, surprisingly wrapped all up into a hike - a really, really long hike.

6961065,3,B00S6MBGY8,"WILD is an interesting film, a narrative of personal development during which Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) travels across the Pacific Crest Trail on her own as a way of escaping the miseries of her existence - the loss of her mother (Laura Dern), and her subsequent slide into sex and drugs, culminating in her eventual divorce.

On the route she encounters a variety of obstacles, including natural disasters as well as predatory men.  Cheryl manages to overcome them through a combination of luck and mental strength.  At the end she discovers herself, and can face the rigors of marriage and family with renewed vigor.

Jean-Marc Valle's film is beautifully photographed with a fine sense of place and time.  Cheryl walks for ninety days through all weathers, and finds ways of coping with the exigencies of having to survive on her own.  Yet the action is somehow banal; WILD tells a familiar tale, and there is little focus on Cheryl's character-development, even though the camera is obviously attracted to her profile, as well as to her naked torso on occasions.

The ending is a total cop-out, as it shows Cheryl willingly accepting the patriarchal order where she has to become a homemaker, to achieve ""respectability"" after the purgatorial process endured by her walk.  In the previous two hours we have seen her learning to fend for herself, and hence it's hardly likely that she would choose the security of home over further adventures.  Nor does it seem likely that such a strong character, who can look after her mother in defense against an alcoholic father, would so readily turn to drugs as a crutch to cope with her miseries.

WILD is an entertaining watch, to be sure, but is structurally flawed",1435708800,,1721,4.903448275862069
6961066,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Anyone who lost their mother when they were young can relate to this great true story. I saw it several times, and am just sorry I didn't buy the dvd.

It left me wishing I could hike at least part of this beautiful part of our country (the woods, not the desert!). It is a testament to the strength within (all of us, I suspect) that with determination & motivation, we can do so much more that we ever thought we were capable of, & in doing so, find the inner strength we may have not known we had.

6961169,5,B00S6MBGY8,"The film is inspired by a true story -
After a reckless lifestyle and haunted by memories of her mother 'Bobbi' (Laura Dern) - 'Cheryl' (Reese Witherspoon) makes a
decision to embark upon an 1000 - Mile plus trek following 'The Pacific Crest Trail' to re-discover herself.
Trouble is she has done no preparation whatsoever for the ordeals yet to come, she starts off with a back-pack she can barely
lift, on-rout the first nigh she has to read the instructions of how to assemble her tent, the same aplys to her use of burner to
cook her food.
She has to overcome the fear of being alone at night in the middle of nowhere and get used to the noises of the night the baron
desert encountered early on.......all this adds up to painfully slow progress.
She finds the unfamiliar creatures and the searing-heat quite challenging, there will be many more yet to come.
During her Trek she has frequent flash-backs telling the story of moments in her childhood, her wayward times leading to moments
of sadness and indeed despair.
On her journey her early progress is laboured, thankfully at a stop-over she gets some sound advice which will lead to her discarding
unnecessary baggage making her burden somewhat lighter along with acquiring more suitable footwear.........only 900 plus miles to
go -
She'll come across several diverse characters along the way.........
This again is a film that could easily pass one by, unless like myself you've read the many positive comments harboured in the reviews
of the film, the thought of watching a lone woman trekking over a 1000 miles maybe not conjuring up a interesting image, however because
of the flash-backs telling her story of the past along with the many characters along the way does make the film both work and indeed
interesting.
It really is an absorbing watch during which you can almost share the pain and frustrations of the trek - It is a story of true
courage and determination often against the odds.
There are also moments during the reflections that are very 'moving'
A truly remarkable story coupled with some stunning scenery along the way.
During the film there is use of colourful language, some nudity and brief scenes of an adult nature.
Well Worth A Viewing.

6961170,3,B00S6MBGY8,"I looked forward to this film, as I loved the book so much I wished Cheryl Strayed had circumnavigated the globe.  The only thing lacking in the book was photos, and so the film's scenery is appreciable.  But what made the book wonderful was Cheryl Strayed's personality, her companionable honesty, humility and wry, detached humor.  Unfortunately, such warmth and dimensionality seems lost in the film.  Also lacking was dramatic tension.  When, in the book, Cheryl comes upon the empty water cache, you feel the terror of dehydration.  In the film, it is just a moment......in the next moment she finds a water puddle, no problem.  Every challenge seems the same......problem/no problem.  The fear, loneliness, vulnerability, exhaustion, cold, heat, relief, gratitude, etc. of the journey are so fleetingly and shallowly portrayed, I did not get a sense of mileage, how the hardships of the journey changed Cheryl.  All dramatic arc is given to the backstory of memories.  Witherspoon did not even seem to change physically, no more muscular or tanned than when she began.

I had higher hopes for this wonderful story.  All I can say is, don't let the film replace the book for you.  If you liked the film, you will probably love the book even more.",1434672000,,1251,4.956730769230769

6961172,3,B00S6MBGY8,"I enjoyed this movie mainly because I recently took up hiking and can relate to some of the funny situations she found herself in. I thought the acting was exceptional and believable.

I rate this a 3.5, but round it down to three because I was really disappointed in the VERY graphic sex scenes. They were flashbacks and while what happened to our protagonist is essential in the telling of this story...the graphic way it was done added NOTHING. What it did do, was prevent me from being able to share with my teen daughter and I would actually be embarrassed to watch it with any other adult, too. Call me a prude, but there are just some things that bother me, and that is one.

SO...this is a gripping story with excellent filming, directing and acting. If you are not bothered by graphic sex scenes then I would recommend it, but beware: make sure there aren't any kids in the room!",1434672000,22,888,4.4753086419753085

6961175,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Pretty good movie...  definitely worth watching.  You got the basic idea of what it was like for a ""broken"" person to try and heal herself by re-inventing herself.  I've known people who hiked the PCT and it is NOT for a beginner, as she was.  I've heard people say there was too much sex, but really -- broken women sometimes try to find human touch wherever they can, to feel closeness.  Having gone through a divorce, and much loss in her life; her mom at a young age,, as well as no real relationship with a father figure, it is really understandable.  The movie tries to deal with this aspect without dwelling on it.  The focus is on her journey to heal.  I recommend.",1434672000,,673,4.370967741935484

6961252,1,B00S6MBGY8,"While Reese is welcome for dinner anytime - this movie is bad.
It isn't a backpacking movie - there is no romance with the outdoors or all the things that make backpacking enjoyable.
It isn't a movie to get into the motivations and feelings of the main character - because the main character is so under-developed one leaves with a G rated readers digest summary of what is surely a very interestintg , complex and at times woman who engaged in socially unacceptable behaviours - notably sex and drugs... but don't expect to be pulled in to her character - because that was all left out.
So - what do you get - a long movie with pretty photos of Reese walking around on a hike.
Very shallow.  Sadly so, given the opportunity to press everyone's ""escape"" ""how to cope"" ""how to overcome"" buttons...

Beautiful scenery and loads of symbolism ( spoiler - the fox is a main character ).  My main gripe was that this is all strictly from her point of view and without any real soul searching -- it is presented as this is what happened.

6961264,4,B00S6MBGY8,"WILD is the story of a woman from Minnesota named Cheryl Strayed (portrayed by Reese Witherspoon).  Cheryl comes from an abusive father and a loving, nurturing mother (played by Laura Dern).  When her mother passes away, she slips into a deep depression, does a lot of heroin and becomes promiscuous.  She finds herself looking for something, anything, that will fill the void.

When her marriage fails, she comes up with an idea that is ostensibly a sort of penance which will purge her life of past sins.  The plan is to hike the entire length of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT for short), which stretches from Mexico all the way to Canada.

In the most physically taxing role of her career, Reese is ragged, tired and minus makeup.  It's a far cry from the glamorous look she featured in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cruel-Intentions/dp/B004GIR0L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cruel Intentions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legally-Blonde/dp/B000VCLGBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legally Blonde</a>.  This role was the epitome of method acting.  I don't know how far Reese hiked, exactly, but I do know she logged a great many miles while wearing an uber large backpack.  Nonetheless, Reese Witherspoon remains a lovely young women, regardless of how ""raw"" she looks.

There are some who are wanting to know if Reese strips down.  The answer is yes.  There is a brief scene where she steps out of the shower in the buff.  You may want to have your pause button @ the ready as it's not central to the storyline.

This film is a remarkable juxtaposition of an introspective viewpoint (what Socrates would have called ""the examined life"") along with the panoramic scenery of the west coast.  People who enjoy movies with great cinematography will appreciate this DVD as it takes us from the desert of southern California to the mountains of northern California to the woodlands of the Pacific Northwest.

If you're in the market for a film that is something akin to a hero's quest motif, then this movie is highly recommended.  For me, it opened a door to a subculture that I never gave much thought to:  people who engage in what  I will call ""binge hiking.""  It did not occur to me that there would be places along the trail where hikers would be able to pick up stuff from their loved ones.  Interesting.

Above all else, the movie strives for authenticity.  The movie was actually Reese's idea > reading the book on which the movie is based.  She wears the exact same clothes that the real-life Cheryl did on her trek, and Cheryl's daughter portrays Cheryl as a little girl.  All-in-all, a well done flick.",1434240000,,2722,5.214285714285714

But Wild neither shows why she was drawn to this walk (except for seeing a book about the Pacific Coast Trail) nor develops believably the process of her healing. I had been looking forward to seeing Wild, but I was really disappointed. Reese Witherspoon probably did as much as she could with so little substance to work with.",1433721600,,480,4.658823529411765

One of the weird side effects of this movie is that after watching, I started wearing dresses and reading cosmo. but luckily that only lasted for a week.  Definitely for the ladies because I could not understand nor appreciate this story and definitely did not give a crap about it after watching it.  But enough about me.  The movie goes like this:  Reese is this girl who has inner demons.  She likes drugs and banging lots of dudes and other unhealthy behaviors.  After her mom croaks, she decides to take a walk on the Pacific Crest Trail.  On the walk she remembers old times, and cries, and laughs and is frustrated and is triumphant, and bangs a dude, and hangs out with dudes and meets some dudes that are helpful and gets some stuff from people (can't remember if it was a dude) back home.  At the end she feels better.  Oh yeah, she also threw her boot down a giant mountain.  The end.",1433721600,6,1002,4.391304347826087

Newbie and wanna be hikers will laugh and cry with Reese, and experienced/former hikers will have a trip down memory lane. I couldn't believe the movie was two hours long, because it felt so short. It ended, and I thought, ""What! Already?"" There is so much more about long-distance hiking that wasn't shown. I would suggest the AT for a first-timer, though. I was very surprised that Cheryl (Reese) ate AT her campsite throughout the entire movie, and never hung her food. These are both major No-No's. Even a newbie would have learned this from other hikers along the trail. By her gear, it looks like she did research, or at least spoke with a rep at REI. They would have told her that, too. Last I checked, ""bear bags/containers"" were a requirement along the PCT, so epic fail there. The ending could have been clearer, about her future life. I had to back up, and watch the ending again to make sure. Overall, a great, inspiring film. PS - Yes, a good water filter pump and purification tablets can fix ANY water source, and REI is actually a lifesaver on the trail.",1433203200,,1197,4.598130841121495

I cried, laughed, cheered and was scared for her more than a handful of times out there all alone. The ending although I understood why it was filmed the way it was - left me with so many questions - wanting to know more and what happened next - I wish it would have shown her return to living - although I know that is not what it was about.

I mean, I may appreciate your love for racquet ball, beekeeping or go-karts, but  watching a film about one of those subjects for two hours usually leaves me educated at best and bored at worst. To be successful, films like this have to use the chosen pastime as a backdrop-not as a story itself. The script does well in making it story about why this woman hikes 1500 miles rather than how. Both Reese Witherspoon (starring as the problem plagued hiker) and Laura Dern ( as her mother appearing through flashbacks) gave stellar performances and I cannot say their Oscar nominations were undeserved. I would if I could since I dislike hiking and saying anything that promotes it could seriously affect my rest. Its worth the 2  hours.

Unexpected sex scenes and drug scenes were startling and graphic enough that parents should be advised.  So glad that we didn't take our teen son to the theater when it was first released, because we would have had to leave.  (That's saying something, because our family is well grounded and our son is not sheltered from reality.)  Her self-debasement following her mother's death was shocking, but not understandable.  She clearly lacked a higher power to weather the loss of her mom, but we couldn't figure out if she found any higher power on the thousand mile trek.  We expected a little more in the way of redemption, but the story and journey came up short.

I mainly wanted to watch the movie because I had read about the beautiful scenes along the PCT and everything I read about that was true.  I was not disappointed.

The graphic sex scenes and nudity detracted from the movie as they were unnecessary to show where the lead character had been in her life; just seemed gratuitous, and maybe meant to be ""shocking"" but didn't really do anything to advance the story. Even though ""things"" happened to the main character, it still seemed like character development was not adequately portrayed. The character never seemed to connect with the wilderness and the beauty in it, just endured it.  You saw her reading books and leaving little snippets of prose at each trail station sign-in, and flashbacks show her mom and her discussing literature/books, but somehow it didn't translate into how self-healing this practice was.  The scenes with the mother's horse also did not add anything to understanding the characters; I think we got that her mother was a very gentle soul, and her daughter was more worldly and harsh without introducing the horse. It wasn't at all clear to me what the significance of the horse was to the main character--did it make her feel guilty, was she sorry about it, did she feel she betrayed her mom's trust?  It just seemed like a movie that had a bunch of disparate parts that weren't adequately meshed together for a cohesive and satisfying story of how a young woman went from a tortured soul to finding peace.",1432944000,3,1343,4.87719298245614

I also spent a great deal of time as an adult learning to camp, and working on being comfortable and safe in the wild. I didn't relate well to this character, who basically didn't do her homework and just entered the wild in a way that could put both herself and others in danger. People that do this every year put first responders and wilderness responders in danger. While, it's great that she was able to put a drug addiction, and horrible experiences, behind her, it felt like she threw herself into the wild in the same way she had thrown herself into drugs. With out a lot of thought, and with out a real idea of what it meant to herself or others.",1432944000,,736,4.190140845070423

Maybe everybody takes their own version of a long hike down the Pacific Crest Trail after a devastating personal loss. For us, the film is affirmative in its notice of the Earth's beauty and the intrinsic good in human beings, the two major things we lose sight of in despair. The entire route -- from desert to bridge and all the people in between -- mirrors the interior journey.

6961581,4,B00S6MBGY8,"This true story captures the journey of a long-distance backpacker and the personal issues with which she was dealing. The trip has an ulterior motive: to find herself and master her demons. During her odyssey, she evolves from painfully naive amateur to experienced backpacker. The memories of and grief relating to her mother, who tragically died from illness in her 40s, haunt her much of the way. Having backpacked myself, I can attest that her journey is set to film quite realistically, powerfully presenting the ""ugh"" factor of this activity. Sadly, her experience also reminds us that the potential for ""Deliverance""-like exploitation lurks in remote places for females who travel alone or nearly so, as it does in more populated environments.

The production is well done and presents some gorgeous scenery. However, some of the most spectacular scenery along this trail is missing--perhaps due to budgetary and logistical issues.

Actress Reese Witherspoon is quite effective in portraying Cheryl Strayed as a woman with grit and a fierce determination to confront and conquer her demons. It appears that with the help of nature and a few helping hands along the way, she accomplished her goals admirably.",1432857600,,1215,5.225641025641026

6961590,3,B00S6MBGY8,Reese Witherspoon did an excellent job with what she had to work with. The movie was disapointing. I expected more interaction with others on the trail which from an outdoors person I would have appreciated that. Books and movies on people soul searching on the Appalachian Trail put this to shame. Not until the last half hour did it meet any of my expectations. Not much of a plot. Reese was great but I wouldn't recommend this movie if you are expecting any outdoor trail interactions. Just flashbacks from her past. If you like that kind of movie then it may be for you. It didn't have much trail action.,1432857600,,608,4.536363636363636

I realize that a psychological drama, which the book was, is hard to shoot as a film.  However, I was dismayed by the fact that the movie left out key players in why she was such a broken person and needed to go in search of herself and who helped her heal.  It also moved events around within the timeline, which made absolutely no sense to me.

6961601,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Warning, spoiler alerts contained within this review: I had just finished reading the book of the same name and wanted to see if the movie would stand up. I have to say it was good. For those who didn't read the book, I can imagine you would be wondering what is going on some of the time. Who is this guy she is meeting the day after Jerry Garcia died and how is that significant to her story? Why is she and her brother killing a horse? For the former, I don't even think that was even very important in the book, though she wrote several pages on it. Perhaps it was the fact that she was self-conscious about what the heavy pack (Monster) had done to her hips, leaving with raw ugly skin on her hips. I don't know. It was a little interesting in the book, but certainly not worthy of time on film. She slept with a guy on her hike on the PCT. So what?

Of course it's always hard to translate a book to a movie, but I felt like the director/producer wanted to touch on a lot of the stuff in the book, when they would have been better off concentrating on a few important scenes and added weight to them. Otherwise it's just Strayed remembering one scene after another of her childhood and how tragic it had been. I guess it kinda works. But it was a little confusing for those who didn't read the book.

I also found the ending a bit anti-climatic. I understand it was a true story and that's what the director had to work with, but after such a long hike and the relief she found finding her own way out of the woods, it could have been crafted a little differently. And the fox. The fox kinda represented the past for her; a time when she was scared. I don't feel like that was conveyed in the movie very well. I can imagine movie-goers being like ""what the heck is up with the fox?""

I did feel like movie goers would get a good sense of how tragic her life had been and how the hike had helped her. At least a little bit. It could have used a lot more of her thoughts being played over top. It was too ambitious to try and portray all of her angst with simple scenes or flashes of her past. I just didn't feel like I knew her that well from the movie. And I was left hanging a bit at the end. Should they not have showed some pictures of her happy with her kids and husband 9 years down the road? Just standing at the bridge looking over the water saying ""how could i know that in 9 years I would marry...yada yada"" wasn't very moving. I will say i did like the line she said about finding her own way out of the woods. Great line.

Anyway, that's my two cents.",1432857600,2,2568,4.079207920792079

6961612,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Noting short of amazing, exquisitely put together story about simple folks and the reality of life.  Wild (2014) is the type of cinema America should be proud of...the type of cinema America should promote and produce more often.  This film is so good on so many different levels.  The story is told through a very personal backpack hiking trip of woman named Cheryl, with incorporated flashbacks of her life ever since she was a little girl.  The flashbacks reveal a lot about Cheryl and the type of environment she grew up in.  They help a lot in understanding the main character and where she is coming from, what she is going through, and where she is heading.  The flashbacks are shown in the style of Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life (2011).  The soundtrack of the film really makes this film emotional...the film left me speechless, honestly when I think about it now, this film is a great lesson about life and redemption or atonement if you like...an inspirational drama comparable to films like Into to the Wild (2007) or The Tree of Life (2011).

I don't understand why Reese did not receive an Oscar for her role as Cheryl. She really out did herself in this one. Just like some reviewer here wrote it is a ""performance of her career as an actress"", and it sure is.

Speaking of performances...the scene towards the end when Cheryl meets the little boy with grandmother in the middle of a national park, and the boy offers to sing for Cheryl the ""Red River Valley"" tune...is beyond words...for lack of words...beautiful...a real tearjerker moment...unforgettable.

It prob hard to depict what is mostly hiking/walking into a movie type venue; and being a backpacker, I found it hard to believe she carried so much stuff (even after the ""strip-down"", wh/also was un-authentic) over rough terrain for so far.  I found the flash-backs disjointed, the movie just didn't flow for me.  I also don't think this was very good work by Reese; too often I felt like she was groping for what she was supposed to be feeling, I got the feeling she's never back-packed in her life, and again, a tiny girl like her huffing around under this huge pack was ridiculous.  The idea of Strayer (author of the book) ""walking her way back to the woman she was (meant to be).."" was a good concept, I just didn't see Reesey doing that, anywhere.
Folks who will ignore the ""authenticity"" and be more drawn to the back- story will like this flic more.  It just seemed a little to ""set-up"" for me to believe.  I don't believe the murky water wouldn't have made her sick.  I don't get why she stayed, after meeting the ""bad guys"", instead of moving on, wh/ she finally did, but later.  Her ""slow"" tread, when exhausted, was obviously fake...did she talk to any hikers at all before making this film?  To me it reeks of old time ""girl fighter pilot"" movies, where the star never put on her oxy mask, because it would cover her beautiful face (and wreck dramatic close-ups).
As Elaine said, ""fake, fake, fake...""

I'd heard good things about Cheryl Strayed's book (which the movie is based on), but again, I didn't do my homework on the book either.  I was expecting a philosophically inspiring movie similar to <i>The Way</i> and instead got a dark and depressing film.

To help prevent anyone from making the same mistake I did, here is a brief description of what the movie is really about.  In a non-linear narrative, a woman loses her mother, then turns to heroin and promiscuous sex as a means of coping with her grief, and finally decides to hike the Pacific Coast Trail as a means of assuaging the pain from her terrible decision making.",1432425600,,752,4.631578947368421

Also, I am a psychologist, and maybe since I hear it all day long, I was a little burned out with the endless self analysis over the loss of a parent and other relationships in the film.  Maybe I just needed to be better prepared and in the mood.  For me it ended up feeling not like an enjoyable escape, but taking my work home with me.

 If you like watching Wild, then I would recommend watching ""Tracks"". The two movies watched side by side are a wonderful contrast of individual personalities and of the cultures and environments that surround  them;  extrovert and introvert, American and Australian, a wild path cut through civilisation and a trek through an ancient land. The American critics praised Wild more than Tracks, but perhaps couldn't connect with the uniquely Australian perspective of Tracks.  I won't rank them. They shouldn't be ranked.

6961744,5,B00S6MBGY8,"irector: Jean-Marc Valle

Writer: Nick Hornby

Cast: Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Gabby Hoffman, Thomas Sadowski

As a high school English teacher, I have a soft spot for films that look to inspire the individual spirit in the name of Romanticism and transcendentalism. Still, one can have too much of a good thing. Films like Cast Away, Dead Poets Society, Into the Wild, The Motorcycle Diaries, and 127 Hours are just a few films that successfully explored the dangerous beauty that is our natural world. Dallas Buyers Club director Jean-Marc Valle and writer Nick Hornby bring just enough passion, beauty, and emotion to their adaptation of Cheryl Strayeds 2012 memoir Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail to keep this film from being too ordinary.

Reese Witherspoon plays the real life Cheryl Strayed, a waitress and self proclaimed sophisticate who when life throws her a curveball, decides to ruin her life further with promiscuous sex and hard drugs. Marriage ruined, family and friends alienated, Cheryl finally hits rock bottom and when a Pacific Crest Trail guidebook catches her eye, Cheryl decides to drop everything and take on the 1100 mile hike in the hopes of reclaiming her life and finding some harmony.

Comparisons to Christopher McCandlesss story in the film/novel Into the Wild are hard to avoid. Similarly, like McCandless, Witherspoons character is trying to escape the corruption of modern life with a voluntary long-term immersion into nature. Much of what Strayed is running from directly relates to a catastrophic series of events involving her mother Bobbi (Laura Dern). Bobbi was a woman of considerable spirit and clearly what Cheryl is truly looking for is where, deep within her, is that same spirit that her mother possessed?

Wild is a surprising film of perseverance and beauty, and Witherspoon plays a character as far from Legally Blondes Elle Woods as possible. Unlike many films of this genre, Wild spends more time examining the human instinct and its conflict with reason. This is what makes it most compelling and oddly most relatable. We don't have to agree with Cheryls choices, and we don't have to understand them, but we can certainly empathize with them. At each mile marker on the Pacific Crest Trail (referred to as the PCT), Strayed leaves short passages from self-proclaimed Romantic poets like Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman as well as those labeled Romantics like Robert Frost and James Michener. The distinction is subtle, but far more relevant to Strayed as she searches for her identity amongst what her instinct suggests and how reason advises.

Wild is a real showcase for Witherspoon. Where Walk the Line demonstrated the actresss range and singing talent, Wild shows she is a real force. Laura Dern is superb as well, playing a mother but also a metaphor for idealism. The one area of disappointment with Wild is in its final scene, which strives for epiphany and comes up short. There is great strength in Wild and great heart. Quite honestly, this film resonated with me more than last years Oscar darling, Dallas Buyers Club, but originality does count for something, and this film does not have much in that arena. Still, Wild is an inspiring film and a great step forward for Witherspoon.  A-

Wild is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 55 minutes.",1431820800,,3345,4.9695885509839

6961756,3,B00S6MBGY8,The book was more interesting because it told more about actually hiking the trail.  I liked both but would not recommend the movie to anyone who had not read the book first.....,1431820800,,178,4.5625
6961757,5,B00S6MBGY8,"I really, really like this movie. It makes you think. The references and undertones are not all spelled out for you, especially in the character's memories of the past - so unless you're at least somewhat familiar to (either directly, or indirectly) experiencing similar hardships as she has, then you probably won't be able to identify with her situations as much as someone who has been touched by similar circumstances.

BUT bear in mind that on the path to adulthood, most people DO make some bad choices - and although they are probably not as extreme as what this person experienced, seeing a correlation between your own mistakes and the character's mistakes will allow you to empathize completely with the character. You will find yourself not judging her for her bizarre mistakes, but empathizing with her, and rooting for her to succeed on her hike.

In her past, the character had chosen the wrong turn in a few critical forks in the road. Her life became a downward spiral, and she was out of control. Fortunately, she was able to see a way out of her turmoil, and convince herself that hiking this trail would cleanse her body and mind - it would (hopefully) somehow absolve her of all of her wrong choices and bad decisions.

Please note that there are a few explicit sexual scenes, which could make the viewers feel uncomfortable if in mixed company; but the scenes are truly purposeful, and mere objectification is not an issue. The scenes are raw, and are for the purpose of keeping it real and honest.",1431820800,,1519,4.724528301886792
6961758,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Nothing against Ms. Witherspoon who did an adequate job in the lead role, but I find the story very weak. To begin with, the main character, Cheryl Strayed, did not hike the entire PCT, but only between 1/3 and 1/2 of it, and in very fragmented sections and yellow-blazed (hitchhiking) large part of it too. This is why I was initially baffled by the claim of hiking ""1,100 miles of the PTC"" which is more than 2,600 miles long. I don't think the hiking community would even consider her to be ""one of them"". To be sure, neither the book nor the movie claimed that she did; but the title and subtitle are suggestive enough.

But that is not the reason I give it a low rating. The reason is that I find the story insipid -- a female junky on a downward destructive spiral in life decided one day to hike the PCT with little preparation. Along the way she recollects fragments of her life, especially those of her time with her late mother who died of cancer. We are led to believe that her destructive lifestyle was almost entirely due to the death of her mother and her grief over it. But surely people all go through tragedies of losing loved ones, but not everyone has to resort to drugs and promiscuity?! At any rate, the recollections are very fragmented and inadequate, for instance, how did she meet and marry her husband? How did he deal with her cheating (there were some sporadic scenes, but we never came to know the character Paul, her husband)? Why and how did they come to the decision to get a divorce?

The character also comes out as a very self-absorbed, selfish, narcissistic and wholly unlikable person. It rather seems that she hated every minute of the hike. What it did for her was to give her some time alone to introspect and obsess with herself and her past. It is also not clear what she finally found out about herself and life. There is a soliloquy at the end which seems only to justify what she has done in life up to that point and absolve her of any guilt on her part. Okay then, you can't get more self-absorbed than that.

I did not read the book, but from the reviews I've read, it seems that the movie is quite faithful to the book.

The book, of course, is a best-selling and highly taunted by Oprah. I have a strong suspicion that there is a large overlapping of Oprah's ""book club"" members and those who buy junk from the QVC channel; I think that there is a strong contingency among us who want others to tell them what products to consume and how to live their lives.",1431820800,,2508,4.364025695931478

6961771,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Excellent movie based on the book by Cheryl Strayed.  The entire cast was superb including Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern who deserved academy awards. Supporting actors were also great including Michiel Huisman, Thomas Sadoski, Kevin Rankin, Gaby Hoffmann, W. Earl Brown, and Brian Van Holt as the Ranger. Director Jean-Marc Valle and cinematographer Yves Blanger who also worked together on Dallas Buyers Club did a great job. The movie is a masterpiece and much of the credit goes to Reese Witherspoon who was a producer. I would like to see the movie again to imagine being on the PCT where I have spent many years backpacking with my wife and family. If you have never backpacked the PCT or Sierra Nevada mountains, then you might want to check it out after seeing this movie. Obviously, don't hike in heavy leather boots (use running shoes or flip flops), and carry a light-weight pack.  Go to REI to get supplies (like Cheryl) but start with short day hikes to get in shape.

To give an idea of her ""wild"" past by letting us know that she was bonking every guy who would ask would have filled in a need in telling the story.  But to go to all the graphic bedroom (and alley) detail was totally over the top and unnecessary.  It spoiled the attempt at telling the promised story.  The promised story could have been a really good one, and certainly one that we were anticipating when we rented the movie.  But the story line was so weak that it got lost in the narrative and all of the time spent off the trail and in socializing with other hikers at the various lodges and at her curious stay in Ashland, OR.  Certainly there were some great moments on the trail, good and bad, along her 1000 mile trek.  Too bad the only moments we got to see were in social settings, off the trail. The ending:  It seemed like another of those movies where the director all of a sudden felt it was time to wrap it up.

6961824,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Reese Witherspoon's performance is convincing, but she picked a bad vehicle for her talents.  The story is about a woman who is trying to ""atone"" for her bad behavior by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. But that's not what the Pacific Crest Trail is about-- it's about exploring the wilderness, and, aside from straggling through it with her ridiculously huge backpack, the ""heroin- heroine"" hardly notices the wilderness-- she's much too busy thinking about herself, right from the opening shot when she calls it a ""bitch"" and flings her shoe into a canyon.
Most of the time, except for the Mojave Desert scenes, you don't even know where she is, although she passes through some of the most biotically diverse and fascinating terrain on the continent in the Siskiyou Mountains around Ashland Oregon. And there are way too many sentimental flashbacks-- movie is at least a third too long.
So, having learned nothing that she didn't already know, the heroine is somehow ""redeemed"" and lives happily ever after with her new husband and children.  I'll bet.  It may work on Oprah Winfrey, but it don't work on planet Earth.",1431561600,,1120,4.915343915343915

Sophisticated! This potty-mouthed loser is probably the most unsophisticated heroine since Thelma and Louise, and as self-destructive. The flashbacks are awful, and relentless, and repetitive. I suppose they're meant to show that Ms Strayed (Strayed? Really? Her name is STRAYED?) had a hard life, but hey, that makes her redemption on the Pacific Crest Trail all the more wonderful, right? Sadly, no. There's no redemption. She's as clueless toward the end as she was in the beginning. (At one point she's hopelessly lost in the snow, when two skiers go past. ""Where am I?"" she screams after them. They turn and reply, in a line I wish I'd had the opportunity to provide her: ""California."")

A woman goes on a post-divorce trek up the Pacific Coast on foot to, uh, re-invigorate herself (something like that). Certainly has it's moments, but the way the narrative moves back and forth from the present to the past is ultimately a little annoying and makes it harder to understand the point of the film.",1431216000,,586,4.485981308411215

6961946,5,B00S6MBGY8,"To many people, Reese Witherspoon is best known for her breakthrough role in ""Legally Blonde"". But long before the American Sweetheart became the ambitiously driven real-life-Barbie trading her peroxide hair bleach and Cosmo magazines for textbooks and degrees, she was an edgy 90s actress who established credibility in a series of meaty roles in darker indie films. They ranged from her critically praised turn as a irritatingly zealous and over-achieiving high school student in ""Election"", the object of Mark Wahlberg's obsessive affection in the MTV Generation's ""Fear"", the status-seeking Evelyn in the 80s consumerist tale ""American Psycho"",  and what I believe was her most memorable turn in a mind blowing performance as the illiterate, loveable poor girl hell bent on revenge in 1996's ""Freeway"". But after her overnight mainstream success in ""Legally Blonde"", her quality ballsy work and career choices began to disappoint as she ventured down the dreaded 'Cameron Diaz' route by appearing in rom-com after rom-com. She did, however, give a memorable turn as June Carter Cash in 2005's ""Walk the Line"", but it was her brilliant ability to portray almost unlikeable, or morally misguided characters, in beefy roles that set her apart from all the other Hollywood gals next door. She was refreshing, with a willingness to take on even the most disturbing work. By the 2000s, I began to miss this Reese, fearing I may never see her hang up her rom com a-plenty career for something more unsettling and thought-provoking.

So, when I heard she was starring in an adaptation of Cheryl Strayed's confronting but brilliant memoir ""Wild"", I thought that perhaps Ms Witherspoon was returning to her former glory. I had high hopes and they were certainly met. In fact, Wild blew my expectations. The film is faithful to the novel, and it is incredibly well made. A lot of audiences have (very predictably) complained about the pace. In their eyes, ""not much happened"". In actuality, a lot happens, but it's a slow build, it's not revealed in a big theatrical melodramatic fashion. I saw this in the cinema and it went for two hours, but could have gone longer. I was so drawn to Cheryl's plight, particularly because of Reese's excellence in inhabiting the character and so convincingly walking in Cheryl's shoes (no pun). The story is quite simple, but at the same time is full of intricate complexities. It's about adversity that all of us will meet at some point in life. Whether it be a painful breakup, the death of a loved one or family, we all have to stare our demons in the face. How we respond to the adversity depends on the individual and in Cheryl's case, she turned to mind-numbing drugs and promiscuous sex. Her struggles became so heavy to bear, that at her lowest she was shooting up heroin and having anonymous sex in a city alley. To turn her life around, or rather to search for the answer that she so desperately needs in order to turn it around, she decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail alone for some 3 months. It became her last resort.

But the film isn't presented in a typical Hollywood manner, that is, with a beginning where everything is good, a middle with a complication and an end with a resolution. We only learn why Cheryl has decided to put herself alone in the wilderness through flashbacks and fragmented, disjointed memories she experiences as she hikes through her journey. It becomes more and more apparent why she needed to leave her everyday life behind as her journey progresses. The strengths of this film are the performances and Witherspoon really shed her skin for the role, reminding me of that raw talent she showcased back in the 90s. I imagine that Hollywood pressure to please her female audiences with mindless romance flicks kept her away from this kind of work for too long. Additionally, having young children may have also been the source of Witherspoon's reluctance to take on controversial material like ""Wild"". But she's finally taken a bite out of the bullet and returned to challenging art-house cinema. She puts her acting chops on display, with no qualms about anything. She bears it all, tackling everything imaginable in the film and as a result, she's a marvel to watch: witty, fierce, brave and vulnerable at the same time. Her dirt-smeared face is knowing but desperate, beautiful, but broken and wistfully in search of something more than dull material-consumerist possessions, alcohol and other modern century comforts. In her own words, she chose to ""put herself in the way of beauty"". There is a scene in particular where Witherspoon breaks down, and without revealing much, she's so convincing that I felt her pain come over me like shards of glass. Laura Dern is equally as great as her happy-go-lucky mother Bobbi. Dern's characters plight to be a good mother and love her children in spite of her seemingly endless misfortunes is heartbreaking. The cinematography is another strong point... it's lush and rich. There are incredible sunsets, sweeping streams of water and dazzling wide shots of the Pacific wilderness that will really appeal to those who love scenery and the earth's natural beauty in general. I appreciated the fact that the story avoided annoying cliches, like tying up everything in a neat little package and spoon feeding the audience with answers, like ""oh, this is why this happened, and there's the happy ending"". Instead, Wild almost ends on a note of ambiguity, sweeping all expectations aside. It's not a cautionary tale or a tale about how broken us humans become. This film is no ""Castaway"" or ""Into the Wild"". It's much more than that and much better, too.

I implore people to see this film and decide for themselves what they think of it. Do not watch it on your phone, or on a computer, watch it on a television screen and make sure you have nothing to distract you, because you won't appreciate the film if you're not paying 100% of your attention to it. People just keep on trashing this film, but they really illustrate their lack of understanding about loss and grief in their reviews, which is so integral to this film. Dare I say these reviewers may be simpletons who cannot tolerate a humanistic film without some mindless explosion or gun fight. It just won't hit the same notes for a person who has had a simple life with few challenges. I believe it will connect most with people who have been down life's hard road one, two or three times. I certainly won't forget this film or Cheryl's story and I'm so glad Reese decided to be apart of it.

One of the best films of 2014 and easily one of Witherspoon's top three performances of her career. It might even be her best work to date.",1431043200,,6707,4.833768494342907

6961982,1,B00S6MBGY8,"Ok, but not great. The story really has nothing to do with the PCT and all about Stayed's self-absorption. Her descriptions of the terrain, flora and fauna and her dailey rituals on the trail are superficial yet she writes at length about her needs (sexual, chemical, emotional), so don't read it if you want a beautiful description  of human powered travel over North America's backbone. If you want real human conquest, without self-loathing, read Minus 148, Mountain of My Fear, White Spider, etc, etc, etc.
Cheryl Strayed was messed up and turns to nature to find herself. Old story, one that had been done a thousand times before. At least she was honest and admitted when she was in over her head, leapfrogging the high Sierras on a bus, whereas in the books mentioned above the authors tackled major challenges head-on.

She over packed the wrong  items, didn't know how to use her equipment and spent too much time with owner's manuals out in the field. Not the time to familiarize yourself on equipment use.

6961987,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Let's face it.  At some point each of us will face devastating loss. Crippling loss.  The kind of loss that seems insurmountable.  And yet, few of us will react to that loss by becoming a junkie and having unprotected sex with strangers.  But Reeses's character does.  And maybe that's why this movie just doesn't move the needle for me.  To begin with, I don't respect this person.  And count me among those who consider these treks of self discovery to be contrived, phony, and self-indulgent.  So given that I just don't buy the story line to begin with, maybe there would be no way to salvage this movie for the likes of me.  And, no, there isn't.  Reese does serviceable work here. But, even though she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role, Laura Dern is  just one of those too-good-to-be-true moms.  The film editing is tiresome as it switches from past to present, but that choppiness is broken up by long periods of nothingness.

The beginning peaked my interest, then the story plodded on for an hour and just fizzled out without ever reaching any sort of climatic point.

6962019,5,B00S6MBGY8,"I was weary of watching ""Wild"" because previous reviewers have stated that this film is slow and boring. Well I'm happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this heartbreaking and gut-wrenching drama. First off, I am completely blown away by Reese Witherspoon's fearless performance. Witherspoon is a versatile actress. You can feel her pain and anguish in her eyes and throughout her body, both emotionally and psychically. She is the essence of this film. She's a little spitfire in ""Wild"" from the opening scene until the last frame. Her character, Cheryl Strayed is rough-around-the-edges (she has a lot of inner-demons wrestling around in her head). Cheryl decides on a whim to hike the Pacific Crest Trial. She plans to hike over a 1,000 miles on her own in the wilderness. She is dealing with the death of beloved mother, a divorce, a reckless and destructive past including adultery and heroin addiction. The flashback scenes are quite graphic, especially the sex scenes. This film might not be everyone's cup of tea but I found the plot very truthful and raw. This is a film about redemption and inner strength. It's not a warm and fuzzy film so be forewarned. Bravo to Witherspoon for pouring her heart and soul into this unflinching film. And I loved the scene where that little boy sings ""Red River Valley"" to Cheryl. Such a beautiful and touching scene. I get teary-eyed just thinking about it. I haven't read the memoir so I can't really say if this film is better than the book or not. Sorry. Give ""Wild"" a chance.

6962049,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Despite a convincing performance by Reese Witherspoon, ""Wild"" should have been called ""Tame.""  Basically a young woman takes on the challenge of a long hike through the woods to exorcise her feelings of depression and aimlessness following the death of her mother from breast cancer.

Though released in theaters, it often feels like a ""Lifetime"" movie.  The problem is that the main character comes off as a naive, self-absorbed narcissist who chooses to take on a physical challenge simply on a whim.  Never a veteran hiker, camper or athlete, she makes the stupidest, most laughable mistakes as a camper.  Many of her early scenes made think this should have been called ""Legally Blonde Camper"", like the moment she collapses thanks to an overstuffed backpack to her including a box of condoms as ""camping necessities.""  As a result, it's hard to take her trek seriously - every step of her ""journey"" felt like a stunt or a form of masochism - suffering for the sake of suffering.

The film tries to prove to us that's she's tough - early on, she's shown painfully plucking off bloodied and dead toenails. The horror, the horror!  In the woods, it's so quiet you could hear a suburban mall girl crying, ""Ewww! Look what happened to my nails!""  Her experiences also reminded me of Goldie Hawn in ""Private Benjamin"" (an entitled, spoiled blonde princess who thinks roughing it is lying on polyester bedsheets).

Unlike ""Into the Wild,"" the Sean Penn film about the tragic Chris McCandless, Sheryl's journey feels trivial, selfish and devoid of a real spirituality (as to emphasize the point, she's shown having lots of sex in flashbacks).  The film is not interested in making a broader statement about the world and grief. Instead, it's all about her, her, her, and her very personal, individual grief about an ordinary dead mother and an ordinary drug and boyfriend problems.

What a disappointment.  Like so many memoirs turned into film, the viewer is left asking, why was this person's pedestrian and ordinary tale adapted to the big screen when so many other lives are more interesting? Is it only because the protagonist was pretty and blonde?",1430611200,2,2151,4.925207756232687
6962050,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Great movie.  Especially great if you have read the book, because the book fills in so much that the movie could not.  Even so, great film.",1430611200,,139,4.3076923076923075
6962051,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Sadly this film does capture the spirit of the book at all.  Touching scenes are omitted (or cut down into micro sized clips) along with touching relationships she made along the way while hiking the trail.  In the film a lot of the ""characters"" from the book are treated as one dimensional people just quickly passing through having no real impact, while in the book you can tell a lot of them she met on the trail were very special to her and helped her keep going. You come to love the people she meets in the book that help her along the way as much as you love her.  Sadly in the film a lot of people she meets are omitted or like I said, are just treated like throw away characters that are never developed.

Reese at the end of the day did a good job with bad material given to her by the filmmakers.  The book has tons of heart and soul, and I felt like that was what was lacking in the film.  And you really don't get a sense of how much Sheryl really struggled while hiking this trail and the physical pain she had to endure.  In the film its made to look pretty easy in all honesty.  Where was the feeling of starvation?  Where was the beating she took for days from the intense heat?  Or the bitter temperatures she put up with in the intense cold?  Or the extreme joy she had when getting to her next stop and receiving her resupply box and be able to eat a real meal?  Everything just felt rushed.  The source material being the book is excellent, which could have translated into a really amazing movie if it was put in the hands of better filmmakers.",1430611200,,1566,4.18

6962059,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Not a good movie. Not necessarily because of Reese Witherspoon. I thought she was pretty good at portraying a pretty bad character.

The protagonist, Cheryl, is a boring, self-indulgent narcissist who - with little planning - decides to hike the PCT, supposedly to escape her demons. The demons are her mother's death (sad but part of life), a foray into heroin and nameless, faceless sex (shown rather graphically), and I guess just her overall personality (perhaps the only real demon in this movie).

I kept hoping for some sort of redemption. Some sort of realization that life doesn't owe you anything. That yelling, swearing every other word, stomping and sneering are not good for the soul. She rarely shows the slightest kindness or empathy to others, and is excessively self-congratulatory upon completion of her hike. Evidently it cured all of the demons, with the exception of her personality?

Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh. She might be a very nice person in real life. I just don't connect with the whole idea that somehow I should admire her for hiking with broken toenails. Though I haven't hiked the PCT, so I guess it's easy to sit on my sofa taking pot shots.

I love the outdoors and the California-Oregon mountains and I was hoping for more inspiring views and scenery. It was well-shot but there was too little of it. Overall the film jumped between the trail and her past so often and with such quick flashbacks that everything felt disjointed and disconnected.

Two stars for me - one because Amazon requires you to give at least one star, and one more for Ms. Witherspoon's efforts. I had really looked forward to this and ended up disappointed.",1430611200,,1671,4.808362369337979

6962082,2,B00S6MBGY8,"Tom Brown, Jr., America's greatest nature writer, outdoorsman, and environmentalist makes the following comment about endless walking - you race to the finish line and miss everything in between. That's pretty much all that happens in this movie. The movie purports to be about the transformative experience of nature yet Ms. Strayed's character encounters nothing transformative during her journey. After endless scenes of Ms. Strayed trudging along, sweating, bruised, and withered, she arrives at the end seemingly triumphant. Why? The movie leaves us asking: what did she experienced on her journey that led to this transformation? what animals did she encounter along the way (a reappearing red fox that, unfortunately, is a metaphor and not real), what did she learn about the Earth, about herself, about Creation? what encounters changed her outlook towards life? Apparently none at least if one goes by the movie adaptation of her book.

There's not a single scene in this movie where Ms. Strayed appears awed by her surroundings. She never looks inspired by the beauty that's all around her not even while camping on Crater Lake! She never looks up to see the stars, she never stops to feel the water, play in the snow, feel the earth under her feet, or get to know the area she's in. There's no awakening to knowledge of the greater beauty of the Earth or that there's more to living than 'sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll'  all of which get more play in this movie than the wilderness. At the conclusion, Ms. Strayed mentions being inspired by the sight of fish in water but there is no such scene in the movie. It occurs off-camera demonstrating the unimportance of such moments to the film's creators. At its conclusion, most people would walk away from this film saying  'who'd do that,' meaning hike the full length of the PCT?

From this movie I would guess that Ms. Witherspoon, the film's producer, knows very little about the wilderness, cares for it even less, and avoids going there at all costs - not surprising for affluent individuals who surround themselves with the coffins of flesh. This is unfortunate since it's this attitude that has lead us to the brink of annihilation. I wish Ms. Witherspoon, who says she's an avid reader, would broaden her horizons. Perhaps she should read some of Mr. Brown's books.

When I go to the woods, it's to get away from the sterility and coldness of modern life; to see as much wildlife and grand vistas as possible; to swim in clear water; to behold the infinite cosmos that's blotted out by our urban lights; to smell clean air; to rise and set by the sun and not by an artificial clock. Watching wilderness from a hotel patio or observation deck is like seeing the Grand Canyon in a photograph - it's nice but doesn't come close to the real thing. Immersing oneself in wilderness is what makes it transformative. Sadly, Ms. Strayed does none of this. Oh, and I never bring literature as if I somehow that imparts ""meaning"" to the wilderness. Shakespeare, Faulkner, O'Conner, etc  may have been a great writers but they knew nothing about the woods.

Here's a tip: Mr. Brown's advice is that when you're in the woods 'slow down, better yet sit down.' Just look, listen, and learn, and 'saturate your senses.' The first time I took his advice an animal came ambling by oblivious to my presence. That was more wildlife than I had seen in a dozen ""hikes"" and I didn't even get ""dirty!"" I also remember that moment better than all the walking I had previously done. I've never again wasted my precious time in the wilderness with ""hiking.""",1430524800,,3595,4.77938808373591

Yet, she chooses to shoot heroin and sleep with any man who will have her. She is not any kind of hero. When I watch a story about a real person, I want them to have truly helped others and achieve something important to the world. As I watched the movie, I found most of the other people much more interesting and nice. I wanted to follow THEIR journey. The one woman she ends up visiting with, left her side pretty quickly. I imagine that as she listened to the Cheryl story all about Cheryl, she left quickly. I wanted to know about that woman and leave Cheryl behind to think all about Cheryl. That is why the ending was even more irritating. She has literally and figuratively screwed her way through life.

6962101,3,B00S6MBGY8,"From Jean-Marc Vallee (DALLAS BUYERS CLUB) and Reese Witherspoon comes WILD, based on the best-selling memoir by Cheryl Strayed. Dealing with issues in her past and what her life has become, Cheryl (Reese Witherspoon) decides to walk it out on the Pacific Crest Trail. These kind of personal journeys make for good dramatic fodder and are excellent star vehicles. Reese Witherspoon gives one of her best performances ever, but at the end I felt underwhelmed. Throughout the entire film there are no startling revelations or crises that require our main character to rethink anything or make meaningful change. Even the way the film unfolds is rather cliche and ordinary, relying heavily on flashbacks to flesh out Cheryl's character and story. Of course, given the talent behind the film everything is artfully composed and presented, but to little effect. The cinematography and natural scenery was beautiful and the score was pleasant to listen to, but I was left mostly unaffected by everything I saw since it all felt so familiar and unspectacular. There was one single moment towards the end that moved me in a special way, and that was when a little boy sings Red River Valley. While I would be foolish to dismiss this film out of hand simply because its story felt cliche and boring (at times), I can't say that it's a great film either. Reese Witherspoon gives this role her all and film is well-made on a technical level, but it had this ""been there, done that"" feel that I can't quite forgive.",1430438400,3,1503,4.852140077821011

I get it: people mess up; but taking a hike did what for her?  She found herself?  Are we to believe that if she loses another family member to cancer she's going to make better choices instead.  I just don't think there was any real resolution to her life, especially if nothing's changed.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I didn't get that feeling.

So if you don't mind the cursing, sex, drugs, and blasphemy, you may like this movie.  We all can use a little alone time sometimes.",1430352000,,841,4.516556291390729

6962136,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Having lived in Ashland from 1988 until last year I was looking forward to seeing it in the movie. Very disappointed that it was portrayed as a '70's sit in- love fest. While there are some hippy types in Ashland, it was not like that in 1995...I actually thought the whole movie was set in the 70's and was shocked that it was supposed to be the 90's.

6962139,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Although the DVD was good quality, I was very disappointed in the movie.  The movie is less about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail than about the difficult life struggles of the author.  Having hiked significant portions of the PCT in Washington State and smaller portions in Oregon, I was very disappointed that the movie ended at the Bridge of the Gods over the Columbia River, thus including no footage of any portions of the WA PCT.  It would be strenuous to get quality movie scenes in many portions of the PCT, especially those portions in wilderness and national park areas which have some restrictions on filming for commercial purposes.  However, I can think of several very photogenic areas that are outside wilderness and national park boundaries.  I think it is a shame that some of these areas were not included in the movie.",1430352000,,836,4.818181818181818
6962140,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Reese Witherspoon's makeup-free performance & spectacular scenery combine to create a worthwhile film experience.  This is not a feel-good flick, but rather, one that lets the audience share in the heartbreak of struggling relationships on several levels.  Supporting characters along the way of her trek contribute to a sense of the culture that springs up along the Pacific Coast Trail & they add a dimension similar to Elizabeth Gilbert's pilgrimage pals in ""Eat, Pray, Love.""  I'm trying to interpret the ending as an epiphany, but Witherspoon/Strayed's toughness has been so impermeable for almost two hours, it requires a suspension of disbelief.  So, on your next moody, rainy day or night,  enjoy watching it in the comfort of your home, which will never have seemed so comfortable.",1430352000,,790,5.238095238095238
6962141,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Somewhere along the trail, the romantic, wistful, daring notion of it all was lost in this movie adaptation of the book ""Wild"" by Cheryl Strayed.  While the movie is most definitely worth watching, it did not do the book justice.  Focus is everything and while her story was at times dark, an entire PCT of dark gets annoying.  There is also the idea that within such darkness one can find true magnificance, true beauty and true enlightenment.  What could have turned this movie around was a little more attention to such things as the deeply moving Dermout's ""The Ten Thousand Things.""  While some of Cheryl's trail messages were inspiring quotes, who could hear them through Witherspoons mumblings?  In fact, Dern mumbled too.  Perhaps some of the exchanges too silly?  I don't mean to be too hard on either the screenwriter or director, but I was disappointed that the movie did not reach the inspirational heights achieved by the book.",1430352000,3,940,4.867924528301887

6962236,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Jean-Marc Valle directs Nick Hornby's bumpy transcription of Cheryl Strayed's memoir and the result is a very long song. The two-hour running time feels as long as the time it took Strayed to walk the 1,100 mile Pacific Coast Trail solo.

For those few who aren't familiar with the story, `With the dissolution of her marriage and the death of her mother, Cheryl Strayed has lost all hope. After years of reckless, destructive behavior, she makes a rash decision. With absolutely no experience, driven only by sheer determination, Cheryl hikes more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, alone. Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddens, strengthen, and ultimately heals her.'

Everyone praises Reese Witherspoon's performance so finding it tiresome is not a possible response. Much of the problem with this film is that 1) it is just too long, 2) the time on the trail is repetitive and not really redeeming, 3) the jumping around from past to present is clunky though Laura Dern and Thomas Sadowsi do rescue those portions, and 4) other than words on the screen in the last frame, is there any change in this character that we have observed in the hopscotch fashion of telling the story that is noticeable? Girl and brother are devastated by their mother's death so girl turns to alcohol, drugs, and frequent anonymous only to recreate a mother's influence in a sort of warped way by getting out and hiking. Must have missed something in the details. Grady Harp, April 15",1430006400,24,1569,4.850746268656716

6962252,5,B00S6MBGY8,"I just finished watching Wild and it was a fantastic movie! It was emotional, intriguing, and full of adventure. The scenes of the Pacific Crest Trail that were in the movie were breathtaking and Reese Witherspoon as always did a phenomenal acting job. I didn't think it was as good as the book but then again, I almost always think the book is better than the movie. The movie left a lot of details out; however, if everything was included, the movie would be extremely long. For this reason, I would really recommend reading the book first to get a good idea of the circumstances leading up to Cheryl Strayed's decision to hike the PCT. I will definitely be watching this movie again and again, along with reading the book multiple times (I very rarely do that). I highly recommend Wild to anyone who wishes to watch a movie about a young woman who loses everyone dear to her including herself and discovers just how strong she is and how her experiences have shaped who she is.",1429920000,2,980,4.5423728813559325

I was reading articles about this movie and about Reese Witherspoon's plans with films and felt reassured prior to watching. I usually like Reese Witherspoon but the movie didn't offer enough time or events for character building.
By the end of the movie all I felt was exhausted after listening to all of the Reese Witherspoon sex noises. Ones she makes to exude physical duress from her time on the trail (at first I thought the male critics were just being donkeys..yes, it's that bad), then actual sex/sex noises (truly didn't need to be that graphic-Cinemax sees that much naked time after hours)",1429920000,,673,4.760683760683761

The backpack she started with and all of its hanging gear is a very relatable if you have done any long distance hiking. I can appreciate the shedding of weight as she became more experienced.
The scenery of the PCT wasn't done justice in this movie. There are so many wonderful landscape shots they could have done that would've yielded a magnificent backdrop...yet they didn't.

There are amusing notes of her naivet about hiking and camping and many somber recollections of past events and mistakes made.  In all, the film is entertaining and inspiring.

I still want to read the book, maybe even more so after seeing this movie.  Relying on one's self in the wilderness seems to create the kind of self-knowledge we could all benefit from, not to mention providing plenty of opportunities for sorting things out.  Reese Witherspoon shows that she's not jut another pretty face once again, and we believe her as she struggles with ill-fitting boots, an extra heavy backpack and the greatest loss in her life -- the mother that she adored who had passed away after a quick but valiant fight with cancer.  She walks the miles knowing she could quit at any time, but then what would be the benefit of that?  Scenery along the Pacific Coast Trail is spectacular.",1429574400,,807,4.615384615384615

So, apparently not going back to the husband she has seemed to be missing. She finishes the hike and the movie just ends with no resolutions, no happy ending,... Nothing. Scenery was nice.",1429574400,,564,4.485436893203883
6962394,4,B00S6MBGY8,"VIEWERS embraced Cheryl Strayeds memoir about her transformative 1,100 mile solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. So did the Academy Awards, where Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern earned Oscar nominations for best actress and best supporting actress. Witherspoon plays Strayed and Dern, her mother, Bobbi. Still, the biggest star is the Pacific Crest Trail itself captured by cinematographer Yves Blanger.

Blanger, who also worked with director Jean-Marc Valle on the Oscar-winning Dallas Buyers Club, captures the forest, snowscapes, mountains, deserts and waterways via the Alexa XT digital camera. Whether presented in day or night, rain or blinding sun, the scenery is magnificent. Together, Valle and Blanger also convey Strayeds isolation. Frequently, she is but a very small spec in a vast landscape. What you might miss on first view is a red fox that might be her spirit guide. We see it first against blazing white, snow. It then pops up again throughout Strayeds journey, and commentary from Valle and executive producer Bruna Papandrea point it out.

Strayed is on a mission of redemption, having lost herself to sex and drugs after the death of the mother she adored. Derns Bobbi is a wise and eternal optimist, who loved her children above all. In fact, she is so perfect, its hard to believe in her  especially when she justifies her choice of husband depicted as a brutal alcoholic that would use her and their children as punching bags. Witherspoon might have gotten the most press for her work, but its Dern who convinces us Bobbi is almost-real. Wild might have made a good family film, but graphic depictions of sex and drugs shown as flashbacks during Strayeds journey target a mature audience. Too bad.

The immersive DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack is very satisfying. Natural environmental sound surrounds us. Pop selections help set the time  1995  but Simon & Garfunkels El Condor Pasa is repeated to the point of madness.

Bonus features thoroughly explore the movie and its origins, with deleted scenes, featurettes about PCT and location shooting, interviews with Cheryl Strayed herself, Witherspoon and Dern, and a user-friendly, interactive map. The film was based on Strayeds memoirs, Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail; she provides a promotional piece, Experiencing the PCT: A Special Message from Cheryl Strayed.

There is no doubt many find themselves  or reset their lives  on a hike. Strayeds extraordinary journey covers both hardships and triumphs.

6962447,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Canadian screenwriter, film editor and director Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e`s eight feature film which was written by English screenwriter and author Nick Hornby, is an adaptation of a memoir from 2012 by American author Cheryl Strayed. It premiered at the 41st Telluride Film Festival in 2014, was screened in the Gala Presentations section at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival in 2014, was shot on locations in the United States and is a U.S. production which was produced by producers Bill Pohlad, Bruna Papandrea and Reese Witherspoon. It tells the story about a citizen of America who in the late 20th century started walking from the Mexican border aiming to reach the Canadian border situated more than one thousand miles ahead of her point of departure.

Distinctly and subtly directed by Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated by and mostly from the main character`s point of view, draws a densely literary portrayal of a twenty-six-year-old daughter, sister, wife, former waitress and aspiring writer and her sacred relationship with the person who brought her into this world. While notable for its atmospheric milieu depictions, reverent cinematography by cinematographer Yves B&eacute;rlanger and real locations, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about circumstantial human interaction and a person`s attempt to change her life and walk herself back to the woman her mother thought she was, which is inspired by the personal experiences of the person this narrative feature is inspired by and where life and the act of living holds the upper hand, depicts a heart-shaped study of character.

This reciprocally appreciative, naturally humerous, down-to-earth and life-giving retelling of an externally internal and transformational journey which is set in America in the mid-1990s and where an orphan whose father walked out of her childhood when she was a six-year-old and whose second maker went when she was a twenty-two-year-old, makes an autonomous decision and stands by it, is impelled and reinforced by its fragmented narrative structure, rhythmic continuity, evocative use of music, efficient flashback scenes, comment by a hiker: My kind of woman., by Cheryl: ..You are the center of me. Everything I am., courageously humane acting performance by American actress and producer Reese Witherspoon and the ephemeral acting performance by American actress Laura Dern. An increasingly heartrending love-story and biographically reflective poem.",1429488000,2,2541,5.631853785900783

When I read the book I found myself laughing out loud, at parts the movie is much more dramatic. The relationships are much abbreviated too. You simply cant go into that much depth in 2 hours.",1429401600,,446,4.137931034482759

6962451,2,B00S6MBGY8,"another movie about a loser. only this time the loser embraces being one at the end of her ""journey"". I am tired of movies about people who go ""wild"" just because something happened to them. Get over yourself and get control of your emotions. Things happen to all of us. That is life. This movie ws a movie about a girl who goes walking through the wilderness in search of herself after she wrecks her marriage with drugs and sleeping with indiscriminate men. Barring the drugs she still sleeps around on the trail. (What I found disgusting is that she had sores ll over herself. She meets this guy and jumps in bed with him. While she kinds recoils at undressing to expose all thse sores. He doesn't. He just starts kissing her body covered with these sores and has a one night stand. Just icky people.) Anyway of course this person doesn't believe in God. She actually curses Him and mocks him (and she wonders why her life is a mess). The seriousness of hiking in the American wilderness is the only entertaining part of this: almost starving, almost dying of thirst, almost freezing to death, almost dying of sun stroke, and the dangers from your fellow man and animal. The one silly part is that after all of the attempt of showing how really hard hiking can be this person doesn't have a hat or sunglasses. But she is in the ""100 degree desert sun"". And yet she is as white as a sheet. Perhaps if they had not focused so much on the self-pity aspects of this character maybe they would not have missed that part.",1429401600,,1518,4.444444444444445

Ban the F word from the writers lexicon.  Gratuitous nudity & sex---pointless.  A pathetic main character who became a drug addict for an unknown reason & rejoiced in dishonoring her marriage vows.
Couldnt figure out if Dern were beloved or hated.  Reese spoke several lines about loving her mama, but she & her brother didn't seem to have a loving relationship with Dern in spite of the interminable flashbacks.
Wish there could have been many more scenic views of the trail, but not to be.  Before Wild ended, found myself hoping Paul would be waiting at the end of the trail, and they could begin their lives anew.  Guess that was too positive a thought.",1429401600,3,705,4.653225806451613

Witherspoon does a fantastic job portraying the real life Cheryl Strayer, who struggling with her mother's death (at the age of 45 from lung cancer) decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail - alone.  As a woman traveling alone and unable to truly defend herself, Strayer must both rely on and necessarily fear what others want from her as she meets various people along the trail. The story is both stressful and inspiring and well worth watching.  A lot of the movie unfolds as flashbacks explain why Cheryl has ended up on the trail.

The film just seemed somewhat predictable and cookie cutter at times and it left me wanting more as it ended. I will note that the film used very little actual trail footage but I am not docking point for that.

For that alone, she deserves credit. All of us have demons from which we run. Yet, to believe that purpose of the hike was to resolve the character's feelings about her dead mother made it all too sappy of an experience for me.  I have been on long hikes and encountered far more scary creatures than two men with guns; for example a momma bear with three cubs,  What was up with that? The movie didn't get into it.  We just had to accept that the character would hitchhike and be happy to be picked up by men, yet be scared of some men only while on the trail. The story was scattered. I felt that, most likely, quite a few scenes relevant to the overall story were left on the cutting room floor. Then there were the ""self-talks"" going on in the character's head which were confusing at first when I first heard them. This movie was certainly not one of Ms. Witherspoon's finest.

The movie was a several month's journey in a little over an hour and encapsulated a woman's soul and heart fighting and loving the natural world either swallowing her hole or holding her gently.

I haven't a clue why reviewers would call this boring. It moves along at a very good pace as she meets benchmarks in her hike, meets the greedy and the lovely people around the trail and finds herself somewhere among it all -- alone but at one.

A must watch film for mothers and daughters. Oh, and I love that she claimed to be a feminist, it's not a dirty word. Female lead roles, especially for women over 30 are rare, and supporting the book and the movie needs to be of interest to 50% of the population that's not male.",1429142400,,830,4.314102564102564

6962585,1,B00S6MBGY8,"The most fascinating part about watching this film is the mind-numbing quagmire of trying to believe anybody would rave about it with 4 or more stars.  Which verifies unequivocally that there are all kinds of people in this world and there aren't any missing, because eating the Styrofoam picnic plate instead of the fried chicken or potato salad on it would make more sense.  It explains so much for me, about emphasis being made currently in politics, celebrities, sports, new legislation, and tax burden.  Those reviews praising this film HAVE to be written by people with investment money involved or close personal family to producers or something to be gained themselves by such nonsense.
The premise of the film alone makes me curious where fans of this film grew up.  How many people have the option to just drop out of life altogether to take a 1,000 mile cross country hike to sort through their thoughts?  While you ponder that, ask yourself what it takes to get a book sponsored by Oprah.  Now get back to work and reality because you know the consequences otherwise.  Or heck if you want to, buy this DVD and watch it.  Just remember I regretted watching it, and am telling you if you have an I. Q. in the double digits or above, youll regret watching it too.
This disjointed film never gets off the ground, never finishes, and never entertains.  Read the book Wild by Cheryl Strayed.  Skip the movie with Reese Witherspoon.  The movie isn't even worth watching for scenic outdoor Oregon landscape.  Read the book Wild by Cheryl Strayed, but skip the film with Reese Witherspoon.",1429142400,,1592,4.749090909090909

6962588,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Haven't read the book (yet), and just bought, received, and watched the movie today.
So I can't compare and contrast between Cheryl Strayed's written words and their evocation on the screen.
Taken alone, the movie is as riveting as the scenic wonders Strayed saw on her 1000 mile hike.
Like a few other reviewers, I've never been a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon.
While the physical Witherspoon showed the strength of independent forward movement, she also depicted the force needed to power through all the barriers God or one's past or life itself tosses in front of us.
The reasons I gave it four stars instead of 5?
There were a couple.
1. The flashbacks were necessary, but they didn't go into enough detail.  I knew (from reading articles about Strayed and reviews of the book) she'd done heroin and was sexually promiscuous and was divorced.  But I would have liked that part of her life to be told more linearly or chronologically.
2. The ending, when she reached The Bridge of the Gods, was wrapped up like a Christmas present done at the last minute before the kids come downstairs to open it.  Too fast.  And too much!  Couldn't her postscript have been spread out a bit more, maybe starting 5 minutes earlier?  Or been cut to two or three sentences?
Also, this happened 20 years ago.
Cheryl Strayed is now a world-famous, rich, together, intellectually and emotionally strong woman.
Is she anything like she was then?

6962590,3,B00S6MBGY8,"First, I loved the book and it's one that I will remember for a long time.  I'm an avid hiker also.  However, the movie missed the mark and didn't seem to translate well to the screen.  The flashbacks were confusing without much detail.  I found myself filling in the backstory for my husband the whole time.  It would have been so confusing and BLAND without knowing what was going on in her head.  The flashbacks left so much up to interpretation to regular viewers that didn't read the book.  It's a disservice to the book and Cheryl Strayed!  And, could they not afford to put one bear in the movie?  She had encounters with at least one bear and saw others!

I think that word pretty much sums it up.  Most will turn my commentary off with the next thought process, but, if you dare, bare with me.  This movie, to me, is much like Anchorman.  The story is so rich with opportunity for a successful movie yet the delivery fell so short.  Based on her interview on 60 minutes, I made the classic mistake I make with so many movies. I went in with high expectations only to get beat down to the reality of the bell curve.  Most movies are meh, no matter how much the marketing says otherwise.

Such a strong story line produced by a company with a great story of it's own.  I applaud their efforts to make more women-centric movies.  Both as protagonists as well as antagonists (Gone Girl). The movie never got out of 1st. gear.  I feel like the cinematography and soundtrack setup the audience for more adversity during the trek (rape, theft, etc.) which, when it didn't happen, kept us in first gear.  Instead of giving us skittle sized tastes of the past, maybe spend more effort in those times and use the cinematography there, hell, I don't know, I'm not in the industry.

Hopefully we get more Gone Girls than Wild from these lovely ladies.",1429056000,,1189,4.47906976744186

However, the story line is very good and the acting portrayed many human emotions to express why the main character was doing the Pacific Crest Trail.  It is quite obvious that she was not an experienced hiker, but looking for a way to a better life.  From my experience, being out in nature can certainly change ones outlook and I can see how doing a 1000 mile backpacking trip could transform a life.

Totally wrong. 2 Stars for Reese's acting (maybe she was still in-the-role when she got her DUI and acted like a self important diva?). It would have been 4 for acting but the movie plot and the self absorbed character could not lift this movie above a 2.
This is a true story? And she WANTS people to know she wandered off on a hike across the country completely unprepared? Her mother was the only person in this story with any redeeming qualities; I wish the story had been centered around her.
I was going to read the book but I am SO glad I didn't. I felt zero empathy with this woman. She goes off the deep end and then takes this unbelievable journey where she basically learned NOTHING except how to get through a hike through the kindness of strangers and a great REI policy.

I just couldn't wait to see where her each footstep would take her next.  There was a new adventure around every corner.  The lead character is a very strong and brave woman on her journey.  (We need more women like that!)  However, her flashbacks to her past reveal some very unsettling behavior by her as a woman.  On that matter, it was unclear how she went from grieving about her mom to becoming a full blown heroine addict who sells her body for drugs.  It was clear that she cared a great deal about her deceased and previously abused mom, but abusing herself as an expression of her grief was counterintuitive and sometimes disturbing.  However, the movie overcame that element by compensating for her sordid past with her current courage.  I think when she howled at the dogs along on the trail at night, it was clear that she was now braver than she ever thought possible; thus rendering it quite an inspirational film.",1428883200,,1053,4.5

The beautiful scenery and story will inspire anyone fighting for a chance at a happy life. Cheryl Strayed was dealing with the death of her beloved mother and a broken marriage. She had fallen into the realms of serious drug use and careless promiscuity when she decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail on her own. Here is Strayed's courageous journey to recovery.
WILD is an amazingly beautiful and inspiring story of a troubled woman's journey to redemption. Reese Witherspoon has never looked more beautiful  even without make-up and in the most physically strenuous role of her lifetime. The beautiful scenery and story will inspire anyone fighting for a chance at a happy life. Cheryl Strayed was dealing with the death of her beloved mother and a broken marriage. She had fallen into the realms of serious drug use and careless promiscuity when she decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail on her own. Here is Strayed's courageous journey to recovery.
WILD takes us on Strayed's journey  and tells her story through a serious of flashbacks. The always wonderful Laura Dern takes a wonderful turn as Strayed's kind-hearted and loving mother.
It's worth watching WILD simply for the gorgeous scenery but this is a real-life inspirational story of hope, courage and love.  Strayed's book of the same title might fill in some missing pieces to the story. We know that Strayed is grieving over the death of her mother but it's not clear why she fell so very low. Her marriage to a loving and kind man has come to any end and we wonder how it all got so bad for Strayed. Another unclear fact is why she chose to hike the difficult  Pacific Crest Trail rather than take a less strenuous journey. Maybe it was just Strayeds destiny to take on this monumental challenge.
Don't miss the extras on this DVD that give more insight into the film and Strayed's life. Above all, don't miss Witherspoon's remarkable performance from the heart.",1428883200,,2098,4.835654596100278

While I applaud the fact that she broke out of a mold, I never really bought into the fact that she was so damaged by personal events that drove her to go on this life changing trip.  The book did a really good job of weaving the personal issues in and out of the trip dialogue and the movie failed short of that.

6962794,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Cheryl Strayed's (Reese Witherspoon) life is in tailspin.  After her beloved mother (Laura Dern) passes at the tender age of 45 Cheryl finds cold comfort in the twin evils of indiscriminate sex and hardcore drug use. In a moment of clarity Cheryl finds inspiration in a pamphlet for exploring the Pacific Crest Trail.  Cheryl makes the  decision to hike the entirety of the Trail though she has no prior experience to prepare her for this daunting task.  When her trek begins Cheryl is making little headway but as time elapses Cheryl picks up small survival tips to help her go the duration. Cheryl not only has to battle the harsh terrain and unwanted sexual advances of men she meets on the Trail but ultimately herself.  Jean-Marc Vallee's film has an interesting structure in that as Cheryl progresses in her goal we flashback to her unsavory past.  This suggests that Cheryl isn't so much running from her past but attempting to transcend it making her a better person in the process.  Witherspoon's performance is wholeheartedly in synch with her director's artistic vision demonstrating guts, determination, smarts, and tenacity.  Witherspoon's work here is truly inspirational probably the best of her career.  In essence Witherspoon is flying solo but Dern shines in her few scenes.  ""Wild"" demands the same perseverance from its audience that made Cheryl's journey so transcendent.",1428796800,,1392,5.119469026548672

6962798,2,B00S6MBGY8,Reese Witherspoon is brilliant as always but the book and the movie were annoying.  The character is a victim and I have a low threshold for victims.  She made horrid choices in life and blamed them on a rough childhood and losing her mom --- WTF!  Get on the bus with millions of other people for pete's sake.  I wanted to slap the crap out of her throughout the entire movie.  She had money for a camera and things that weren't needed but didn't plan enough money for food.  File this under stupidity and don't get me started on having hiking boots that were too small.  I find it hard to believe that an REI employee would have allowed someone planning to hike the PCT to buy boots that were too small. I wanted this book and movie to focus more on the positive side of the journey on the PCT.  It might have been decent if it had been more about the miles traveled and less about the stupidity that got her there...The lessons learned with each step and the strength gained from taking them...not just on the trail but in life.,1428796800,5,1031,4.305699481865285

So I pre ordered the copy and it arrived on my doorstep the day it was released. I thought it was a great movie but I also thought it lacked a lot of things too. The book is always better than the movie of course but this one didn't quite live up to my expectations. I love Reese as an actor but I don't think her performance was worthy of an Oscar nomination. Laura Dern however nailed her part. All in all it is worth watching but maybe wait until it comes to redbox or shows up in the 5.00 bin at walmart",1428710400,,680,3.8992805755395685

Now the actress in her previous movies is cute and funny, and I believe a very good actress, playing a harlot of whore was over the top for her, nothing wrong with true love, that is good, and good romance is good, but pickup sex, not good.

6962843,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Overflowing with an exceptional sense of pain and beauty, ""Wild"" is a retelling of the age old tale of learning from the consequences a young person's mistakes. It's not as thoughtful as it could be, nor is it the grandiose masterpiece that it tries to be. But that doesn't mean that the obvious effort put into the substance of the story is any less impressive, wherein rarely is it that we are able to see a tale of such depth told from the eyes of a female protagonist. It won't be for everyone. There are obvious moments that are extraneous and deviate from the tone the movie takes as a whole, and some characters and moments are clichd beyond the need. But there's a moral tone that is unmistakable, and for those that are willing to watch it through, Reese Witherspoon's character will become as beautiful as the adventure itself.",1428710400,3,837,4.586666666666667

The time-splicing style of the director got a bit choppy through the middle, but things smoothed out and meshed fairly well by the film's end.  Not a good film if you're a male and want to build your self-esteem, but OK for Chick-Flick Night.  Also memorable for a cameo of what must be the Worst Ever Grateful Dead cover band.

The scene I was really hoping for was Cheryl/Reese accidentally running into Thomas Pynchon somewhere in southern Oregon, just as he was penning the last few paragraphs of ""Vineland.""  Now *that* would have been really cool...

6962878,3,B00S6MBGY8,"The true life back-packing journey of Cheryl Strayed is portrayed in Wild, which got Reese Witherspoon a Best Female Performance nomination for her simple and unflinchingly genuine turn as the aforementioned lead of this tale, in an occasionally intriguing but too often routine fashion. We see the pain in Strayeds eyes early on as she calls those who care about her, checks in and out of a hotel and bums for rides and from these commonplace scenes alone the movie takes on a position to tell a story that answers these questions as we reveal what she is running from, what made her go on this journey. For most of the first half the acclaimed film works in this fashion as we slowly peel away the intricate layers of Strayeds past and find the answers these commencing sequences originally posed.
 Up until about the hour mark Witherspoon, and the motion picture itself, is quietly fascinating. The power of her performance alone keeps us watching even when the film turns into the usual catalogue of flashbacks to flesh-out details of the backstory and the triumphs and painful lessons of her past are unveiled.
 It is once the movie hits the halfway point of its 116 minute length that the filmmakers seem to content to use traditional methods to address the questions which brought such intrigue in the early stretches and the proceedings are hindered greatly because of this action. What follows, we quickly realize, is that the rest of the cinematic duration sadly coasts on this easy route of addressing exposition and the story begins to wallow, lag and sputter to a falsely obvious conclusion.
 Strayed reads poetry, eats, meets several intriguing characters (one sequence involving a burly man who turns out to be friend instead of foe is strangely remarkable despite its mundane simplicity) and goes through the necessary points of transformation to get the narrative where it needs to be but it all seems hollow in the second half. Its as if the filmmakers abandoned the intimate feel which made these traditional hallmarks all the less glaring in the first hour because (a) they didn't trust the audiences patience or (b) they felt they had too much story (which is really not the case here) and needed to get things moving.
 Laura Dern, as Strayeds mother and fellow schoolmate, is solid in her scenes and the chemistry between her and Witherspoon do add a bit of the touch that made the early moments work in this, decidedly dense, second half.  Our attention returns, even though their shared screen-time is incredibly scant, during these moments but still the overall feel still seems a bit too comfortable. Its too predictable and still, even during these moments where these two capable actresses are together, one cannot help but think that these are all cinematic ingredients that we have seen far too many times before.
 The argument could be made that regardless of how acquainted most of the narrative feels it is a part of a true tale and, out of respect, doesnt deserve such criticism. This may be true in this context but surely there had to be a way director Jean-Marc Vallee and screenwriters Mark Hornby and Cheryl Strayed herself couldve presented this tale to audiences in a manner that wasn't so customary and straight-forward. Vallee had a solid story on his hands but, as it is, he squandered it by telling it in a format that becomes tiresome, is often unremarkable and gives the solid performances populating the screen often head-scratching, ridiculous dialogue and because of this the proceedings of this film that wants to be a piece of great, moving cinema is drug down to something we admire more for its bits and pieces than as a whole.",1428710400,,3681,4.844197138314786
6962879,1,B00S6MBGY8,"Why is it that the whiney journal of a somewhat broken woman who goes off the very deep end into chaotic, random reckless whoredom AND heroin addiction because she couldn't cope because her mother died, was supposedly interesting enough to (a) publish or (b) be made into a boring movie? Cheryl ""Strayed"" was such an overty weak young WOMAN (not a child) to sink that ridiculously low over the death of her mother (it was not her husband or not her child who was the avowed LOVE of her life)...huh?...how immature is that? Seriously. Cheryl ""Strayed"" was a married WOMAN when her mother died and she responded by screwing any strange man who offered his penis to her WHILE she was married BECAUSE she was thrown for a loop when her mom got a tumor and died in the month instead of year the doctor said she would have. Heck, my mother died within days of being told she have 6 months...I didn't go crazy and start screwing anybody. Nor did I turn to heroin. I didn't smoke a cigarette even though it was very upsetting and sad. So what makes this pathetic person interesting? Nothing that I could see. Especially not her trek along the Pacific Coast Trail. She complained to herself the entire journey! I wish I didn't waste my time with this ""f_ck"" ""f_ck""  ""f_ck"" ""f_ck"" ""f_ck"" cinematic nonsense.  And speaking of the dialog, the Cheryl ""Strayed"" poetry quotes that were written on the trail start journals were mumbled throughout and the font on the screen was soooo small that it was unreadable. So the part I would have found interesting was garbled. So much for that. Some of those flashback scenes were unnecessarily graphic. The scene with the closeup shot of the penis in Witherspoon's mouth...twice...was two scenes too many of a full mouth like that.",1428710400,3,1760,4.674193548387096

I just never found some magic solution or one moment that turned life around, and I kept my kid so I did not have the luxury of a 100 day journey to get it together.  More to the movie, it is slow going and disjointed.  I only choked up during the inevitable memory about the horse.  The rest was sort of run of the mill.

I watched this movie to see what hiking the PCT actually looked like. But so much was left out. And I watched the BluRay version which just wasn't impressive. The scenery she hiked through is amazing but the videography made it look washed out. The scenery didn't add to the movie.

6962904,3,B00S6MBGY8,"You get to see Reeses pieces, but other than that I didn't really take much from the film that I hadnt already gotten from shooting imaginary heroine in-between my toes and imagining what it would be like to be perfectly fine with getting tag teamed in a back alley by perfect strangers so I could feel absolutely anything other than relentless guilt and devastating loss.

Not sure who first said it, <SARCASM>perhaps Miley Cyrus </SARCASM>, but life is about the journey and not necessarily the destination. Wild is not about completing 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, its about beating yourself up over how s***ty a person you have been every excruciating step of the way, and about how disappointing you imagine that you are to the ghosts of your lost loves to abruptly end those rare moments when you almost forgive yourself, get lost in the present, and actually have a legitimate good time without feeling guilty for so doing.

We all get lost form time to time, but eventually we come out of the wilderness of our own suffering, conquer our inner demons (sometimes by letting them rape us while we are stoned and thus transmitting them VD  the delayed knockout counterpunch), and realize that we are exactly who we were meant to be all along  a crack whore.

Despite how terrible our past decisions seemed to be, they all helped shape who we were destined to be or whatever. Not a terrible movie by any means, but definitely not one that Id likely see again unless re-watching it was the only way that a mysterious benefactor would just give me their millions from the delusional fog of their deathbed.

6962948,3,B00S6MBGY8,"I have seen the movie, read the book, and hiked the PCT myself.

The book, and the movie, are much more about Cheryl Strayed attempting to ""find herself"" than they are about hiking the PCT reaching redemption or an epiphany.

Per most movies based on a book I would recommend reading over watching.  No surprise there--the book has the freedom to delve, and sometimes wallow, into much more lurid details if you have a predilection for that sort of thing.

Although most of the hiking sequences were NOT filmed on the PCT (and thank goodness because the trail is now extremely overcrowded--the longest I went without seeing another person was about 4 hours and I went all the way from Mexico to Canada) the depictions of the scenery, conditions, and struggles are authentic.  Although I didn't see anyone on the trail so woefully ill-equipped and unprepared there were still plenty of kids trying to ""find themselves"" between the watering holes and blisters.

Reese Witherspoon does an excellent performance and the movie is probably worth a rental for that reason along (the backpack scene in the hotel near Tehachapi conveys the ridiculousness of the moment on both tragic and comic scales).

But if you are looking for a movie/book about hiking the PCT (and why would you be?  Get off the couch and go for a hike instead!) then this is not it.  This is more about the author's overindulgences and self-destruction.

I'm a big Reese Witherspoon fan and have been for a while, but I think she's got it all wrong in this film. Within a few minutes, I was already sick of the bad attitude and whining of her character. She turned up for a 1000 mile trek with 12 condoms, hardly any water and the wrong fuel for her stove.

I didn't care about the character, and because of the way the films timeline is set out, you only get information in small flashbacks (which is annoying). This all means that you don't fully discover why this trek is being done until over an hour into the film. By that time I'd already mentally checked out and couldn't care less about the back story.

I'm not certain what this film is supposed to be. It fails as a self-discovery film as the character who is supposed to be a recovering sex addict sleeps with one of the first guys she sees on the trek. It also fails as a survival movie as no less than 8 days into a 'character building wilderness trek' is our character hitching a ride back to a man's house to have a hot dinner and shower??? As with most reviewers, I can admit the scenery is beautiful and the film is reasonably well shot. Although I suppose they couldn't go too wrong with the PCT as a backdrop. But even the physical aspects of the film don't add up. Reese has no sun tan/burn after weeks in the baking sun. Her hair certainly doesn't resemble the hair of someone who has been trekking for weeks.",1428451200,,1560,4.28135593220339

6962959,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Wildthe #1 New York Times best-selling autobiographical account of Cheryl Strayeds impulsive 1,100 trek along the Pacific Crest Trail following the devastating death of her mother and the breakup of her marriagewas also an Oprah Book Club selection. Its easy to see why. Its a story about one womans descent into hard drugs and promiscuous sex with anyone wearing pants, and the journey into nature that led to her redemption, renewal, and a recommitment to life.

Ive seen reviews in which serious backpackers have rolled their eyes and said that this is for wannabe backpackers, and here too its easy to see why. Strayed is like playwright Tennessee Williams Blanche DuBois, who always depended upon the kindness of strangers. She attracts assistance because shes a rare woman alone on the trail, and when the proffered help comes from men, theres always a price to paya sexual tension. But in a bonus feature on this Blu-ray, the real Cheryl Strayed says that the trail itself wasn't all that hard (which probably REALLY annoys serious backpackers). The hard part, she says, was the life she led prior to her decision to hike from southern California to Washington.

That may be true, but when that harder life is relegated to relatively brief, impressionistic flashbacks in the movie version and the burden of narrative falls on the present-time hike, were left with a single woman facing potential rather than real dangers, and a plot thats more the stuff of a plodding-along indie flick than the dramatic arc of a typical Hollywood movie. Think 127 Hours, because the focus is on a single character with flashbacksexcept that theres no real climax here, only an emotional one.

But Reese Witherspoon, who earned an Oscar nomination for her trouble, really does a fine job as Strayed. She gets it, and from one bonus feature that shows the real Strayed bonding with her on the set, you can see why. At the heart of it all is the loss of the one person who meant the most to Strayed, and Laura Dern manages to play her mother with surprising insight and compassion. And when we learn that Strayeds daughter played the young Strayed and interacted with Dern in scenes, it makes the story all the more poignant.

Thomas Sadoski, who played Paul, the man whom Strayed divorced (after she had had multiple affairs), also deserves a shout-out, as does Paul himself. In the film he comes across as a very understanding and supportive guy who doesnt play the victim game.

So where does that leave us?  Wild is a solid film, but not a spectacular one. The first act gets off to a slow start, and the lack of a familiar narrative arcrising action, crisis, climax, falling action, denoumentworks against the film. But theres something about Strayeds (and Witherspoons) journey that compels us to watch. Maybe its the promise of something more, but maybe, just maybe, its the whole reality-show feeling that we get from watching. Embellished or not, this really happened, and it feels more important than anything you see on Survivor.

The Blu-ray itself is nearly perfect, with a terrifically immersive DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio and a video (2.40:1 aspect ratio) that features the kind of dramatic scenery youd hope forbut with filmic grain and camera angles that support the surreal elements of the entire venture. Its definitely worth getting and watching againif for no other reason than Witherspoons sensitive and gutty performance.",1428451200,,3425,4.925476603119584

Not having read the book, I went into the movie with only a basic understanding of the plot: woman trying to discover who she is, where she has come from and where she's going, as well as coming to grip with the death of her mother.

Typically, in these types of movies you find that flashbacks occur maybe once in the movie to set up the following storyline. In ""Wild"" we are repeatedly visited by these flashbacks, one more graphic than the last, until we completely understand the depths of Cheryl Strayed's depravity.

I like how this journey along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), parallel's Cheryl's own life, venturing out into the unknown, learning as she goes, finally understanding that she IS capable of standing on her own. What was also interesting was her relearning to trust her own good instincts. Trusting people that ultimately helped her, and knowing when not to trust others that could harm her.

While all of Cheryl's problems are not solved at the end of the movie, we get a glimpse that going forward she's better able to handle the curves that life brings.",1428451200,,1153,4.669950738916256

Or if it can, this wasn't it. Frankly, if I hadn't read the book I would have had no idea what was going on half the time in the movie. It was is if someone filmed Cheryl Strayed's random thoughts and stuck them together on celluloid, without context or plotline. For example, the part in the book where Cheryl and her brother must face a dreadful task together and botch it horribly was so well-written in the book that I was literally writhing on my couch at home, so agonizingly was the scene depicted. The film's version of that pivotal incident is so patchworked and fragmented that I could scarcely understand what was happening (and wouldn't have, had I not read the book first). There are only two reasons to watch this movie: 1) you read the book and you're curious to see how it translates to film and 2) Reese Witherspoon. Except that she's way too thin, she IS Cheryl Strayed. (Remember how Strayed lost weight on the trail? When Reese-as-Cheryl begins the journey, she is stick-thin. If she lost any more weight she'd have to stand twice to see her shadow.)  She captures Cheryl's metamorphosis skillfully and admirably.

6963041,1,B00S6MBGY8,I expected much more.  Im sure there is a way to poignantly tell the story but im afraid Reese Witherspoon's portrayal fell way shory.  No matter how I tried I could not identify with her characterization hense felt nothing for the troubled grieving hiker.,1428364800,8,256,4.795454545454546

6963043,2,B00S6MBGY8,How about a movie that features a person who leads an exemplary life for a change? Instead we get a druggie and sex addict who tries to escape their life by taking a 1000 mile walk in a rather unprepared way and then writes about it. Nice scenery and good acting.,1428364800,,263,4.176470588235294
6963044,3,B00S6MBGY8,"OK, actually 3-1/2 stars. Love Reese, and she gives a spirited performance here, but the story line is a hard one to get too excited about, and the supporting performances are very good but not enough to lift this to another level. I think part of it was due to adherence to the book, and while it was quite a journey for the young woman by any measure, adapting it to the big screen is a tough task. Worth watching, just don't expect too much beyond the story line.",1428364800,,466,4.247191011235955

And yet the author describes meeting her Bill-Gates-doofus-looking husband as the most handsome man in the world. I say that to point out that the misandry the producers felt must be in the film to appeal to the most disaffected women.

As a guy whose done a lot of backpacking I had to see this movie because there are not many movies out there involving backpacking.  The movie has some gratuitous scenes and a certain ""chick-flick"" aspect that wasn't quite so strong in the book. Which is why I liked the book better I guess.

6963167,1,B00S6MBGY8,"Ugh!

Although brilliantly acted by Witherspoon, it was difficult to slog through and make it to the end credits.  What sold me on the film was the prospect of an uplifing journey of discovery on one of America's premier long distance trails.  What I found was endless drudgery through a very twisted woman's (well deserved) self-loathing  and presented to the viewer as flashbacks throughout her PCT journey.  FYI, there's more flashback than journey, and I was unable to connect with either the present storyline of the PCT trek, or the dis-jointed presentation of her disturbed past.  Most of tlhis movie seemed to be Strayed saying ""F-You"" to her life.  We only find out in the last scene that she eventually found some peace with her self-inflicted circumstances.  Good for her, in the end, but I wish I had not gone with her on this journey through this film.  100 steps, FLASHBACK, 100 steps, FLASHBACK, FLASHBACK, 100 steps.  This film would have done so much better if we could have spent the first 1/2 focusing on her past and mistakes, and then spent the last half on her journey and how it inspired her to heal.

If you like a 2 hour character study of a woman who ruined her marriage, lost her mother, and then went on a heroin binge, hiked 1000 miles, and then FINALLY found some perspective in the very LAST scene, then this could be your film.

If you think this film will have ANYTHING to do with hiking, or the PCT - You may want to reconsider.",1428278400,21,1462,4.559386973180077
6963168,3,B00S6MBGY8,"My wife and I watched Wild last night, and we were admittedly disappointed. Witherspoon's performance was genuinely solid, but the movie fell flat. Further, the film never really captured the grandeur of the PCT. In fact, most of the scenes portraying CA were filmed at Smith Rock State Park in Oregon. Spectacular stretches of wilderness that helped Strayed along in the process of self-forgiveness are never captured in the film version. Instead, we simply see Witherspoon meandering along.

After reading 'Wild' by Cheryl Strayed, the film was a let down. There was so much that was missing, that Reese Witherspoon in this role was not as believable as the real thing. The book was so engrossing, itvwas difficult to put down. There were parts of this film that dragged. Certainly Reese Witherspoon gave a fine performance, not quite Oscar worthy, but pretty good.

Wild begins with the new to hiking, Cheryl Strayed at one of the lowest points, screaming as her climbing boots fell down a mountain. This was the highlight of the 1,100-mile-long solo trek along the Pacific Crest Trail for me. It showed the real angst that Cheryl felt in her trek towards Oregon. Trying to figure out her life after her mother died, she list herself in one night stands and heroin addiction. Her ex-husband saved her, and she cleaned up enough to realize she wanted and needed something new. Trekking the Pacific Crest Trail seems a little outlandish, but itvwas enough for Cheryl.

The music if the times and the music Cheryl's mother loved us played throughout the film. The scenes and sights of the wilderness is superb. Some gorgeous sights. It seems now, that anyone who wants to rid themselves of a devil can find themselves in some sort of trek. Strayed's mission statement: Im going to walk myself back to the woman my mother thought I was. Seemed to be the jumping off point. The people Cheryl met along her trek were memorable all for different reasons.

Reese's and other cast members' outstanding performances, especially Laura Dern's, who we have not seen enough of in recent years, the
photography was beautiful throughout.  I have hiked on part of the PCT and in my opinion there is no question but that trail scenes were  shot
on the actual trail.  How they managed to keep other hikers out of the camera's view is a good question, since when I have hiked the Northern
California part of the trail I was hardly alone.  I give Reese additional credit for making the decision and effort to bring the original, very moving book to the screen.

And I wouldn't recommend it strictly as a movie about backpacking--not at all.  It did have that, and a person might learn a little of the realities of long thru-hiking, but it wasn't really about the PCT.  The hard backpacking was really a metaphor for the ruggedness and at times lost-ness of her journey and inner journey thru life to that point.  Her trip was a chance to process all her experiences and to somehow integrate them better, find more of who she is at her core, and what she's learned from her life experiences, and find her ""trail"" for the next phase of her life.  It did have some beautiful scenery tho.  I think that somehow the movie kind of unintentionally made light of what she went thru on the trail.  I think she showed a lot of resolve and ingenuity to get by as well as she did, especially until the point well into her hike where she got new boots.  I don't believe just anybody could attempt that and be as successful even as she was.  What she did was extremely hard and took a lot of commitment, resolve, and some good problem solving to get thru.",1428019200,,1191,4.447004608294931

Director: Jean Marc Vallee
Producer: Reese Witherspoon
Starring: Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern
Really good movie and a true story about a troubled young woman taking on the Pacific Crest Trail.
True makes it different to criticize, and for me closer to the heart because I spent much of my life in that country. I never did the Pacific Crest Trail.  Only parts of it. But from my experience Cheryl Strayed made a good guess in finding a place to heal.  I would give this film five stars for it's content, but this is the Pacific Crest Trail, and the camera doesn't capture what an awesome place it is.  Except for brief shots in the beginning and one fox, the film lacks birds, wildlife, meadows, quaking aspen forests, thunderstorms, waterfalls.  Certainly those things could have added richness throughout the story.  Especially when the story is about healing.

Cheryl's personal struggles add a lot of complexity to this outstanding story and those troubles seem to weigh her down as much as her oversized pack.  Her thoughts and the pain in her life are the demons she has to face as she walks into an overwhelming wilderness.  She seems like a loner and does not readily pair up with other hikers.  She begins her trek from Mexico to the Bridge Of The Gods over the mighty Columbia River.  Reese does a really excellent job acting as an inexperienced hiker taking on one of the toughest trails around.  There's lots of humor in the film which I enjoyed, especially the beginning.  I also like the way she just plunged ahead on the trail without even knowing her gear.  Sometimes you just have to jump in there. After some time with the film I started thinking this movie is more about Cheryl and her past than the Pacific Crest Trail .  Just as Cheryl struggles northward, she struggles with a variety of addictions and the devastating loss of her mom.  Special film if you've ever had a tough time.",1428019200,,1910,4.659701492537313

6963234,3,B00S6MBGY8,"I think Reese is a great actress and did a good job in the movie. However, I did not like the book and didn't like the movie. I think Cheryl either exaggerated her experience or is just a plain dimwit.  The character building was to scant. Too much of the hike was under emphasised...for example...did she really NEVER stop and take a look around and ""wow...think this is beautiful""  ?  Maybe then I would have felt a little more affection for her outcome if she wasn't so unlikable throughout. And what's with the orgasmic sound of her hiking in the opening scene ?

6963283,3,B00S6MBGY8,"I think the problem with this movie is the director really doesn't build a compelling argument as to why we should really be rooting for the main character other than the same reasons we generally root for anyone in life who chooses to take on a challenging long distance trek. The scenes which show the main character with her mother don't really paint an emotionally gripping portrait to which we can really grab onto. To be honest I didn't even buy into any mother daughter type of relationship there. I didn't see a good relationship, I didn't see a bad relationship, it just seemed all kinds of disjointed. I wanted to see childhood scenes where it was obvious why she loved or hated her mother. And we really don't see anything such as a kind of battle with herself before she descended into drug use and self-destruction before her journey begins. A scene where we see her make a 'choice' to go down the path of darkness would have been beneficial. All we seem to get is that we are left to draw our own cliche reasons as to why she fell into a period of decadence. Compared to other drug addiction movies this one gave a pretty tame representation of heroin addiction also. This movie could have really benefited from showing either a true consistent struggle between mother and daughter or a really profound bond there. Maybe knowing what kind of child she was too. And the lack of a storyline between the loss of her mother and the lead up to her descent into darkness is really a shame and would have given us more of a reason to identify with whatever internal battles she truly had. To me the intensity just wasn't there in the journey, it seemed the most nerve wracking part was at the beginning when her shoe feel from the top of the hill, otherwise there really wasn't any other strong 'oh no!' scenes in the actual hike to speak of. Maybe it was so true to the actual story that any embellishment for the sake of the audience experience would have been disingenuous but to me this movie really lacked a lot of depth and intensity.",1427846400,14,2047,4.490616621983914
6963284,3,B00S6MBGY8,Wild is a decent 3 star movie with some nice scenery and mostly accurate long distance hiking action despite Reese kicking her equipment when she got mad. No backpacker would ever kick their equipment.  The back story was just routine and could have been entirely done away with to make it a 4 star movie.,1427846400,,305,4.545454545454546
6963285,2,B00S6MBGY8,"I had much higher hopes for this movie. I had read the book a few weeks ago and enjoyed it, which surprised me as I never really liked Strayed's character. I think I enjoyed the adventure aspect of the book, the hiking, and her interactions with others but Strayed rubbed me the wrong way. Still, even the fact that she would embark on an adventure of such great magnitude impressed me and inspired me. The movie, I did not like at all. Many people have been singing Reese's praises as far as her acting in this movie, but I just couldn't buy her in this role. Of course, everyone has different tastes and opinions. The fact that I didn't like Reese in this role, didn't connect to the character much even in the book, and all of the choppy flashbacks really put a damper on this movie for me.",1427846400,2,793,4.328859060402684

This is a another loser movie, about a women who is a drug addict, bangs every man she can find, is an alcoholic and lacks character. She decides to ""find"" herself by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, which is about 2700 miles long, and finishes part of it. She buys equipment that she doesn't understand, does nothing to get in shape, basically does nothing to prepare for the hike and starts out. She survived the hike because of a lot of luck and masses of people along the way who took pity on her. The hiking part of the movie is sprinkled with flash backs of her screwed up past life which clearly demonstrate what a loser she is. Now it seems that to some segment of our society that she is some sort of hero.

6963293,1,B00S6MBGY8,"I grew up in Olympia Washington, went to college at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma.  I am well aware of the Pacific Coast Trail and while my hiking goals are modest, I am aware of the absolutely magnificence of the abundant natural settings that are found along the trail.
NEVER in my 63 years have I ONCE heard this wonder of nature referred to as the PCT. It sounds like a disease...'polycythemia thrombocytopenia"".
Hiking along this trail, with the enjoyment of the spectacular environs that are available to see and appreciate along the Pacific Crest Trail is done with passion and respect.  It is not accomplished by throwing one's shoe across a ravine and uttering a profanity.
The film was over promoted and the pathetic attempt to create a sympathetic heroine fell flat on her butt.  In my opinion I do not believe it is too harsh to dissect the poor choices made by the author and after ward conclude that her ""so-called"" corrupt life after her mothers death was anything close to true 'grief work'.  Grief work involves real emotional ""WORK"", with an aim toward healing one's pain by helping the soul become more like a nurturing adult for the grieving person. This has to be the worst Reese Witherspoon I have seen.  My disappointment in her performance which resulted entirely on a stupid 'who cares' narrative that she chose to breath life into, is simply CPR with no organs left to harvest.",1427846400,3,1413,4.727642276422764

I was complete unprepared for what transpired via Hollywoods' interpretation of her book.
There were several extremely graphic and slightly violent sex scenes that they incorporated in for shock value.
Although it was part of her experiences, they portrayed it in a way that left me feeling uncomfortable and uneasy.

6963329,4,B00S6MBGY8,Good movie.  I liked it but it is definitely not for everyone.  This movie is great if you love the great outdoors and hiking and love to watch people transform their life.  This is a movie that is geared more toward women and their issues.  It has some bad language so if that offends you do not watch.,1427500800,2,303,4.172413793103448

6963353,1,B00S6MBGY8,I watched this movie because all of Reese Whitherspoon's movies are awesome..... this one was very very poor.  One she as an actress does not respect her body to have sex with so many men on screen all for making big bucks.  I didn't know what this movie was about other than a woman on drugs a hiker by day hooker by night.  I wasted money on this one.,1427328000,5,353,4.086956521739131

6963355,4,B00S6MBGY8,I read the book first and I think that helped me to understand the movie.  There were some details left out of the movie that would have been helpful as basic information.  I watched the movie with two other people and had to explain a couple of scenes in the movie when asked why certain things happened.,1427328000,,305,4.333333333333333
6963356,5,B00S6MBGY8,Absolutely fantastic.  This was the first chick flick I've seen in along while that really caught my attention. There was never any mention of religion but there was know way of survival for her without the love and kindness of others.,1427328000,,235,4.7317073170731705

6963363,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Meh. Acting was fantastic. Cinematography as well. Script was a little bit ""High Fidelity"" on the trail.

6963364,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Wow!! I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this film: the performances, the nature, the music and the triumphant fact that it is truly an awesome true story of a woman's journey back to her true self. Reese Witherspoon is at her best here...I find her so compelling in stripped-down, humanistic roles (see also ""A Far Off Place"" & ""The Good Lie""). During and following my viewing of this film I found myself reflecting on my own life...great art does compel one to explore and ""Wild"" is great art! Recommended.",1427328000,,511,4.818181818181818
6963365,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Great the first 2 thirds of the movie.  The last of it did not translate from the book very well.  Even if you have not read the book, the end falls apart slightly.  Great acting though.",1427328000,,186,4.111111111111111

6963393,5,B00S6MBGY8,"I thought the movie was very inspirational, so much so that I have decided that I want to do the hike as well.  The plot offered a very raw look into what what life is like for many people of this generation.  A generation filled with so much written history in which to learn from, that we find our selves with all of the answers, but very little inspiration and intestinal fortitude required to apply such knowledge.  This movie helps show how sometimes the best inspiration for the future is finding out what really lies within our soul.  I feel like taking a few months to live by yourself, and appreciating nature in its purest form is a great way to accomplish such a feat.  I give the movie two thumbs up!",1427241600,,712,4.363636363636363
6963394,4,B00S6MBGY8,"I bought the movie after finishing the book.  I live under a rock apparently -- when I was reading it I didn't realize there was a movie.  Anyway half way through the book I was telling a friend about the book and she said isn't that a movie - huh???  Anyway, had to get the movie if for no other reason than I had to see the PCT and since I'm in Missouri thought it would be a good way to do it.  So the movie is good -- I like maybe it's Reese's best performance.  I always don't LOVE movies that are from books I've read - the book is always better -- but this was nice.  It was like coming home to see some old friends or something.",1427241600,,636,3.853846153846154
6963395,3,B00S6MBGY8,"The story with its multiple flashbacks (which seemed often to repeat the same sort of scene) made the movie seem a little muddled and difficult to follow.  I wasn't too convinced that it was a cathartic experience for her, but it was certainly a feat to stick with it and complete it.  I was also impressed by how well organized she was (she seemed to have thought of everything she could possibly need), her calm in difficult situations, and her ability to stand up for herself,  The topic is original, unusual for the subject of a movie, and  interesting.  The acting is excellent.  I was intrigued by the different types who go on the Pacific Crest trail and how well the trail itself is set up.  On gthe whole, an ambitious, original, courageous movie.",1427241600,,756,4.597014925373134
6963396,4,B00S6MBGY8,"It was really refreshing to see Reese Witherspoon play something other than an upbeat pretty girl for once.  She is gritty and grimy and real in this movie and I liked it.  Her portrayal of a woman struggling to overcome her demons and finally death with the loss of her mother is moving.  On her trek along the Pacific Coast Trail, she not only faces tests of strength, courage and endurance but must also finally let herself feel the pain and heartbreak that she has been running from for so long.  For anyone who's suffered the loss of a close family member, it feels true to the kinds of emotions that we all go through.  This is basically a one woman movie.  Other characters pop in from time to time as they cross paths with Reese's character, Cheryl Strayed, but she is this movie.  In a lesser actor's hands, this could have come off as forced or melodramatic but Reese Witherspoon makes it her bitch.",1427241600,,909,4.472727272727273
6963397,3,B00S6MBGY8,"A good, but non-spectacular performance by Witherspoon, and a narrative that suffers from being ""too close to the book."" The ending isn't adequately set up by the preceding story.  But overall worth the rental.",1427241600,,210,5.176470588235294

6963404,5,B00S6MBGY8,I enjoyed this movie for the journey emotional journey she took as well as the physical one.  Because I have a home in the Sierras and love the mountains I wanted to see the movie but it was so much more than just the place.  This is a movie that I will remember and a book that I loved.

6963433,1,B00S6MBGY8,This movie could have been soooooo good.....but it was not. Aside from Reece Witherspoons excessive use of the F word (it was uneccesarily overused - and added nothing to the film) I found the flow choppy with an ebb and flow that gave no time for tasting the moment and considering what was happening.

6963438,3,B00S6MBGY8,"not the best performance of reese witherspoon's career (walk the line, election) but not the worst either (four christmases, legally blonde 2). this one is somewhere in the middle. the film itself is about the same. thankfully it did away with the most annoying aspects of the book, of which there were many. unfortunately it also failed to fully capture the few profoundly moving parts. so, it all averaged out to be something, well... pretty average. part of the problem with the film is its hurried and fragmented structure. this is a story that needs breathing room, little of which was offered. the director, Jean-Marc Valle, tried to cram too much into just under 2 hours. we only spend enough time in cheryl's memories to understand what she did, not who she is. conversely, her time on the trail, which is the central narrative of the story, is too broken up by said flashes of her memories to really get a sense of the durational and epic experience that is hiking the PCT. the cinematography is perhaps the most interesting and beautiful aspect of the film, mostly handheld, capturing the unsteady trajectory of the main character and just enough awe inspiring wilderness to pique viewers' imaginations. go ahead and watch it but keep your expectations low and wait until it's available for rental. i bought it and now wish i had waited.",1426982400,6,1347,4.810344827586207

I wondered if the director and screenwriter understood what was really happening in Cheryl Strayed's life. We're fans of Reese Witherspoon but she was physically and emotionally miscast. The actress portraying Cheryl Strayed needed to be larger and have had a more athletic physique. In retrospect it should have been Cheryl writing the screenplay. Jillian Flynn proved how important it is for an author to have cinematic control over the story with 'Gone Girl.'

I am a bit saddened for Cheryl. Her story and memoir were remarkable. We had the good fortune to meet her and frankly she is more remarkable in person. She deserved something more than a film that felt like nonlinear segments misappropriated and badly glued together in the editing room.",1426809600,2,865,5.0

I did not feel bad for her or for the choices she made. I couldn't help get all ""Dr. Laura"" on his girl. Pick a corner and cry in it! She had NO business going alone in the wilderness for that length of time! Not entertaining for me because I just couldn't like the character!

Wasn't impressed by Witherspoon. This movie should have starred a ""no-name"" actress. I kept seeing Legally Blonde in the wilderness. Witherspoon's face is just too common for this movie.",1426723200,4,645,4.322314049586777

The book really moved me and changed the way I approached my recovery from brain surgery.  The book has nothing to do with my situation, but I felt like Cheryl had a sort of recovery she was trying to get through and because of that I was able to relate to her in some ways.  It is by far one of the best books that I have ever read.  Needless to say I was very excited about the movie coming out on video on demand (I didn't have an opportunity to watch it when it was at the theater).  I watched the movie yesterday and I am in the process of watching it again today.  I feel like the movie doesn't do the book justice.  The book goes into great detail about the relationships that she forms while she is walking the trail and the book gives you a lot better insight into her past and why she is on the trail.  I realize that there is only so much that you can pack into 2 hours and for that reason I still really enjoyed the movie and I am sure I will watch it multiple times.  I would just say that if you have only watched the movie, please read the book also.

6963466,4,B00S6MBGY8,"In sum, I found this to be a much darker version of Into the Wild, but that was only a superficial assessment. First, Reese Witherspoon turns in a compelling, engaging performance. Yet, as this film popped up as ""recommended"" and I'd never heard of it, I assumed it was going to simply be a predictable, female version of Into the Wild. But, it's actually a much darker, but also entirely different character study. I actually found it MORE interesting, having seen Into the Wild recently, than less. The contrasts and different lessons learned-tales told make for a stark, profound story - particularly the repeated, unfolding flashbacks to her earlier life, which provide much of the impetus for her decision to undertake her journey. I loved this film, though it was difficult to watch in places, which, I think, is one of the hallmarks of true art.",1426636800,5,852,4.842465753424658

She wants to be a better person, the one her mother wanted her to be, and believes this will help her.  Women can identify with this film more than men and rightly so because of the storyline and strong performances which brought both Witherspoon and Dern Oscar nominations.
For people that enjoyed this film I might recommend the Australian film ""Tracks"" a true story about a young woman who sets out to cross 1700 miles of Australian outback in 1977 with her dog and 4 camels that she accumulates along the way.",1426550400,2,800,4.619718309859155
6963469,4,B00S6MBGY8,"Certainly a freaking good movie and a rare affirmation of femme-power in a male dominated world. We're witness the rebirth of Reese Witherspoon as a capable actress after the horrible That Mean War and other uninspired efforts. Heck, even Laura Dern turns up with a decent role. This was based on a memoir of a girl who lost her mom and went ape, doing drugs and rampantly risking every STD/STI in the book with random hook-ups. I felt for her and Reese W made me empathize even if my religious beliefs permit me from sinking to her depths. I pitied her. There was no epiphany throughout, but I got the feeling that the ""Bridge of the Gods"" that Cheryl (the woman portrayed by Reese) is easily symbolic of a spiritual/religious dawning. The fact that she admitted to a happier marriage - one blessed by a Judeo-Christian lord. Anyway, it never gets too preachy if that's what you're worried about. Recommended for the holy, the hedonists, and the hell-raisers (though hopefully it was teach a thing or two to the latter two groups). There's a neat little product placement worked in for REI, because Cheryl (the woman portrayed by Reese W) has ill-fitting hiking boots purchased at that store. She even has to pull off her own toenails (super sick!) and REI ships a new pair to her at no cost. Huzzah!",1426291200,2,1301,4.636363636363637
6963470,5,B00S6MBGY8,"I never thought Reese would be able to pull it off but she and the director sleigh this book's adaptation about as masterfully as I could have ever expected. Reese gets down and dirty and the whole film seems super realistic as you feel her pain and journey, sometimes like you're in the tent with her. I talked with many hikers afterward who said it was just like that. The many flashbacks are woven in as memories in her mind and are a brilliant way of getting into Cheryl's head and keeps the story moving. Laura Dern, in a small but believable role as her mother, is so amazing as well. At this point, see it on bluray or Instant when it comes out (the quick flashbacks may make you wanna pause often - did I just see that?!?) - but definitely see it! I saw it 3 times in the theater, and each time I pick up something new. For those saying it's boring, you're just not paying enough attention to the many nuances or maybe you better prefer Transformer movies.",1426291200,2,964,4.302197802197802

Instead every frame and every scene of this film is drenched with the personal story that both needed to be told, and for Reese, needed to be embodied.  Self-deprecating humor and the sorrow of crushing loss flesh out the true story of Cheryl Strayed (how apropos that name) on her journey to a place often unknown to most of us  that truth which is deep inside ourselves.  @kmptop10",1426032000,,637,4.87037037037037
6963472,1,B00S6MBGY8,"I had the unfortunate chronological mishap of first viewing the 2013 Australian film ""Tracks,"" a tale identical to ""Wild."" Perhaps-- just perhaps-- I may have warmed to ""Wild"" without the exquisite experience of a vastly superior film, also based on a true story of a one-woman wilderness trek fueled by identity crisis, nourished by wild vistas and even more savage memories, with a narrator-caused death of a beloved animal, a stolen female parent, and a best-selling, one-word titled book that attempts to cast a fool's journey as a primal narrative that casts all humankind in its central role.

I urge everyone who has seen ""Wild"" to wait two weeks and see ""Tracks."" If you've only one searing, one-person travelogue in you for this year, again, see ""Tracks."" Every single detail of ""Tracks"" is more engaging on every level imaginable. And since the book ""Tracks"" came out 20 years before ""Wild,"" I am hard-pressed to not believe that it was theprecise, beat-by-beat template, if not the exact inspiration, for the author of the later, and much inferior tome. ""Tracks"" follows Robin Davidson's 1,700 mile solo trek across the outback deserts of Western Australia, twice as long as Cheryl Strayed. She too, became a surprising cause-celebre among male adventurers along a wilderness route that few, if any, women had undertaken. She too, embarked on a journey into rawest nature without a fully articulated reason that she would not understand until the physically exhaustive end of the trail-- also overlooking a body of water that symbolizes the regained ""flow"" of the main trekker's life essence.

But in ""Tracks,"" the physical transformation of walking for months under a searing sun is readily seen in sunburned skin and altered frame. The lessons she learns are solid and logical and deeply understandable. The grand ""scenery"" that drags the narrator along when her body can't seem to keep going is, without question, a visual siren. And, her trek really does provide her an accidental entirely new life as a writer, a life she had never before considered. Would that ""Wild"" could have replicated ANY of these instances of an authentic journey. ""Wild"" is as mind-numbingly boring as it is uncomfortable and confusing and suspiciously artificial. Here goes: An insane, mentally-ill response to grief is treated as simply ""natural."" The journey into a natural wilderness is taken explicitly to get a book out of it. This character wears her ""literariness"" as a badge.

A casual, sickening sexism is at work in every single scene (and there are a lot) of the female narrator interacting with any and all men-- she either lives in constant fear that they will rape her OR reject her advances; yet the film is not about her sexual oxymoranism, her inability to see the male gender as anything but a hideously weak yet threatening entity, as only existing to fulfill her desires of being parented, of finding an outlet for lust, or giving her children.

The film is also not about her physical transformation from heroine junky to expert hiker, with seemingly no bodily repercussions from either. And it's also not about how she learned to transform her experiences into the written word, or why, when she lived in a snowy city, she decided to walk a desert. Nor is it about how the landscape and its animal denizens and far and few between human wanderers specifically taught her to survive or gave her the inspiration to even want to survive a life where she was a horribly destructive, completely empty zombie of a human being. And, above all, ""Wild"" is not about the lessons learned. She simply finishes the walk and says in so many badly written words, "" I'm OK. All the bad stuff I did made me who I am today, so they couldn't have been THAT bad, y'know?!""

I honestly could not figure out What the film WAS about, as the narrative is completey framed by negatives-- the exact opposite of ""Tracks."" Redemption tales rise and fall on specifics, on hard-won details that are tricky to translate to a wider audience that hasn't experienced them; otherwise how could the minutia of an individual series of tasks become universal and far-reaching? In ""Wild,"" the narrator is as insulated at the end as she was at the beginning, and confesses repeatedly throughout that this story is only valuable insomuch as it is her story alone, utterly unique to her and cannot be duplicated by someone else. So she wins the ""Special Snowflake"" Award of a life that becomes as surface-happy as it was previously miserable. The hero of ""Tracks"" retains her bristle, and gains a human brush of patina as a reward for deeply interacting with landscape, animal, male human and past mistake and memory.",1425945600,14,4689,4.907944514501891
6963473,5,B00S6MBGY8,"WILD is a simple story, told with economy against a beautiful, but sometimes sparse and stark scenic background.  Reese Witherspoon plays Cheryl Strayed, a young woman torn apart by grief over the loss of her mother and the consequent behavior she embarks on including infidelity and drug-use.  She is a smart woman with a nice husband, but apparently without the emotional resources to weather the storm of her loss.  Her path could easily have taken her to an early and ugly death.

But by good fortune, Cheryl has at least enough on the ball to recognize shes near the bottom, and her plan for redemption is to walk the 1,000+ mile Pacific Crest Traila tough trek for experienced hikers, and a brutal one for Strayed, who doesnt have the know-how.

Despite this being a true story, the basic premise has the ring of clich.  A personal journey of redemption, as this troubled woman is both worn down and built back up by the impersonal harshness of nature.  And thats true.  But it is told amazingly well, has far more humor than you would think, and features the best performance of Reese Witherspoons career.  She is never anything less than magnetic, and her face shows you all you need to know about what shes thinking and experiencing.  Witherspoon clearly connected with her character, and shes a marvel to watch.  Its easy to take her for granted as a performer sometimes, but WILD will remind you that behind the frivolous faade of characters like Elle in LEGALLY BLONDE, Witherspoon has a unique presence that she can bring to bear for the right material.

I didn't know much about the Pacific Crest Trail, and I assumed Id just see one vista of startling beauty after another.  But a lot of it is desert, and it isn't always glorious.  Sometimes it seems dry, dusty, windy and unforgiving.  Watching Cheryl cope with the early days of life on the trail, trying to set up her tent, trying to make decent food, forcing herself NOT to give up, is much of the drama of the story.  But its done so well, and with such a strong dose of welcome humor that were with her all the way.

There are lots of flashbacks in the film, so that we understand to some degree what Strayed is going through.  Many feature scenes of her with her mother (Laura Dern, playing what seemed to me to be a variation of her nutty character on ENLIGHTENED).  Clearly, Strayed relied so heavily on her mother for love, courage and stabilityand when she loses that we see her unmooring.

Its heavy stuff, but I cant emphasize enough that Witherspoon and director Jean-Marc Vallee (the excellent DALLAS BUYERS CLUB) bring big doses of humor to this film.  Life on the trail also brings plenty of chance encounters with amusing characters and amusing circumstances.  The film never drags and while the journey of personal redemption theme is an old chestnutthe landscape, the approach and the lead performance make this a must-see, in my book.",1425600000,,2921,4.686274509803922

6963476,4,B00S6MBGY8,"One woman takes the long, hard (and literal) road to self-discovery in Wild, Jean-Marc Vallee's adaptation of the empowering memoir by Cheryl Strayed. A book club favorite and a phenomenon inspiring millions of loyal devotees, the book caught the eye of Reese Witherspoon some years ago, planning at first to merely produce rather than star as the much-younger (at the time) Strayed, but it's to all of our benefit that she took on the role as it's easily the best she's had since her Oscar-winning performance in Walk the Line.

Penned by the great novelist Nick Hornby, who has written a book or two about personal redemption, Wild details Strayed's extraordinary 1100-mile hike along the Pacific Crest Trail, an attempt to walk herself away from a history of bad choice and personal tragedies, in hopes of finding the woman she wants to be on the other side. We've seen these kinds of stories before, in fact one very recently in Tracks, which told nearly an identical true-life tale of redemption. The two share much in common from an aesthetic and thematic standpoint, but Wild is the more complete film by far, one that bristles with emotional resonance and enlightenment.

Beginning at a moment when her journey has taken an unexpectedly precarious (and bloody) turn, the story then splits two-fold, one in the present and another mostly in flashback. And there are plenty of flashbacks; flashbacks of every kind, in fact, but all are necessary to dot the points in Strayed's life that drove her to make such an audacious decision. She's not a hiker; or at least not an experienced one, and this is a dangerous trek for those who know what they're doing. What's obvious right away is that something terrible must have happened, either to her or caused by her, that led to this. When we see her struggling to even begin the hike, literally stumbling under the weight of her gigantic backpack (nicknamed ""monster"" by others), we know it's just the start of an arduous ordeal that she may not walk away from.

The particulars of her past are doled out in bits an pieces, flashes of memory blurred with reality. In actuality they aren't all that hard to figure out or understand. We see her loving and forgiving ex-husband (Thomas Sadoski), who she cheated on with multiple men while on a downward spiral of heroine abuse. The root cause of her self-destruction concerns her angelic mother (Laura Dern), whom Strayed both loves and begrudges. It's a little weird to think of Dern as Witherspoon's mother considering how close they are in age, but it works because their relationship they share is closer to that of siblings than mother and daughter. Casting isn't the issue; both women are phenomenal here, in particular Witherspoon in a grueling, captivating performance as vital as anything you'll see all year.

More troublesome is the fractured narrative and redundant use of flashback that makes it difficult for the film to find a steady rhythm. It's a small price to pay for a deeper understanding of Strayed, and we come to see the extent of her self-afflicted heartache. What's even more fascinating is her attitude about the choices she's made, suggesting at one point she'd do it all over again, the drugs and the random hook-ups, not because they inform who she is now but because they were enjoyable. They did what they were supposed to do which is serve as a diversion, but if Strayed wants a future those behaviors simply can't continue. Deeper shades of her personality peek out along the way,especially during her interactions with others, who are almost exclusively men. These encounters add a tinge of danger because, let's face it, she's a woman out alone in the woods surrounded by guys who may not have seen a female in months. So much about Wild works in just the right ways that what doesn't tends to stand out. Strayed's quoting of great poets comes off as a weak attempt at profundity which we never really see in Strayed, while the occasional appearance of a spirit animal is a little too on-the-nose for a film that strives so hard to stay grounded elsewhere.

Wild is another bold effort from Vallee, who directed Matthew McConaughey to an Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club. He seems to have the touch for pulling career-defining performances out of his stars (he gave Emily Blunt her breakout role in The Young Victoria), and Witherspoon proves more than up to the task. Raw, emotionally and physically fatigued, it's great to see her in something meaningful again. She may no longer be America's sweetheart like she was years ago, but roles like this could turn that around real quick. Beautiful panoramic views aside, there's little to the cinematography truly captures the dangerous terrain Strayed must tread; Mother Nature is never the constant threat we would expect her to be. She's not much of a threat at all, really. The real battle is within Strayed, urged by others and sometimes herself to quit; the perseverance she shows is infectious and makes us want to tag along on her journey.",1424908800,17,5024,4.837209302325581

And third, this is a woman's movie about her life and its challenges. How she comes to understand herself and change is the reward for watching a great performance and a great actress.

Her performance in ""Wild"" transcends time and space. Someone at The Academy needs to do a recount. I didn't think it was possible for Reese to top her Oscar Winning performance in ""Walk the Line"" or ""Legally Blonde"",  I was wrong.

It tells a great story with amazing acting, it shows redemption in the least cookiecutter way possible and it does not depict the main character as a crazy feminazi or a damsel in distress.",1424476800,45,646,4.52991452991453
6963481,5,B00S6MBGY8,"In a recent interview, actor Reese Witherspoon said something to the effect that she started her own production company in order to make films she and her partners wanted to make and that they would have a strong female influence. If ""Wild"" is any indication of what will come, I can't wait. This film is based on the memoir, ""Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail"" by Cheryl Strayed and was scripted by Nick Hornby. With Witherspoon as Cheryl, the film is directed by Jean-Marc Vallee (""Dallas Buyers Club"") with drama, humor and a deep look into the soul of the troubled woman.

The film opens with a hilarious scene of neophyte hiker Cheryl trying to attach her over-stuffed backpack to her shoulders. The backpack is literally as big and heavy as the woman. The film manages to go back and forth between events on the trail and those that led up to the woman attempting such a daunting test. That is, to walk a 1000 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail to Oregon. During the 3 month journey we learn how earlier events in her life led to a failed marriage, drug addiction and random sex. Seeing a brochure in a store, Cheryl decides to strike out on her own on the hike to Oregon where she has decided to settle. Along the way, she meets strangers, some friendly, some not. The journey is painful, both physically and emotionally, for both Cheryl, and I suspect Ms. Witherspoon.

There is a strong supporting performance by Laura Dern as Cheryl's mother Bobbi, but Witherspoon carries the weight, literally and figuratively in this award-worthy film. I can think of no stronger performance this year. The film is beautifully shot, using locations in Oregon and Washington. Cinematographer, Yves Belanger mixes the ruggedness of the wilderness with its natural beauty. Witherspoon and her business partner Bruna Papandrea were also heavily involved in this year's ""Gone Girl."" They are off to a terrific start. I love this film.",1424304000,126,1941,4.773809523809524
6963482,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Wild is quite an experience. We find ourselves side-by-side with Cheryl Strayed, played with fervor by Reese Witherspoon, as she hikes the Pacific Crest Trail and rediscovers herself after her mothers death. Directed with great care by Jean-Marc Vallee, Wild is an intimate and personal film, one that dives deep into our central characters psyche. With stunning landscapes and great use of flashbacks and storytelling devices, Wild is an unforgettable and emotional journey that leaves a huge impression.

Based on Strayeds 2012 memoir, which I greatly enjoyed, Wild puts us in the shoes of Strayed in her self-healing. We feel her pain, see her experiences, and we are up close and personal with her; everything she feels, we feel. With a great use of flashbacks to flesh out Cheryls story, Wild strikes a delicate balance of biographical storytelling. The more accessible scenes of Cheryls physically exhausting hike are paralleled with flashbacks of her past. We learn of her mothers death, her nasty divorce, and her reckless sex and drug abuse that leads her to make the decision to hike over 1,000 miles. If you're not a fan of flashbacks, Wild probably won't change your mind, but give it a chance because they're necessary to get the full picture.

Cheryls a likable character, to be sure, and Wild reminds us this fact several times along the trail. Her journey is funny, emotional, and altogether enjoyable. Any backpackers will relate with her struggles with her monster backpack, and her side journeys to towns and strangers homes gives us scenery changes that show Cheryls true colors.

Wild really excels at creating an emotional bond between the viewer and Cheryl herself. This wouldnt be possible without Reese Witherspoons outstanding performance, her best by a mile. Witherspoon connects with Strayed in ways unimaginable, striking a chord with anyone in the audience. Wild is a feminist tale, and its great to see a well-developed female protagonist in such a physically and emotionally empowering role. Witherspoon lays out all her cards on the table as Cheryl Strayed. Shes vulnerable, but also she isnt; Shes open to repair her emotional wounds because she understands herself. Her conversations with fellow backpackers along the PCT show us the true Cheryl.

Strayeds mother, Bobbi, played by Laura Dern, is also a great character. Despite being developed entirely in flashbacks, we know enough about her to know she was more than just a mother to Cheryl. Dern brings her A-game as well  her infectious smile and personality are enough to put a smile on anyones face with their well-developed mother-daughter relationship.

Cheryls reinvention of herself parallels her emotional turmoil of her past, and the film employs unique devices to create that bind. Director Vallee is smart in his framing and storytelling devices that book readers will catch, but also non-readers will be familiar with and recognize. Its some expert filmmaking that I haven't seen in a long time. With Dallas Buyers Club and now again with Wild, Vallee has solidified himself as someone to watch. The film is meticulously and beautiful crafted, with beautiful landscape shots that make the viewer want to be there alongside Cheryl, and a soundtrack with hand-selected pieces that mirror her journey, Wild is the complete package.",1423958400,303,3329,5.166975881261595
6963483,5,B00S6MBGY8,"Beautiful, original and truthful. I totally got this movie. Going into nature alone is perhaps one of the most meaningful experiences modern human beings can have. And its not a romantic experience. Wild seems conceived and executed by people who actually know what its like to be alone and have to deal with our internal turmoil. Its better than Into the Wild because the subject is not sensationalised: the drama is personal, simple and human. The chance meetings are convincing. I liked this a lot.",1423785600,,501,4.905882352941177
6963484,5,B00S6MBGY8,"I read the book about 18 months ago and found it to be a very compelling and engaging story, but couldn't really imagine Reese Witherspoon in the role. Though she has proven her merit as a serious actress over and over, she seemed too girly and feminine to take on this role in which the author revealed all of her warts and imperfections and past errors with blunt honesty. I'm glad to say I was wrong about Reese. She really inhabited the role, from the gruesome scenes of lost toenails, bruises and trudging for 2 days in sandals after she lost her boots, to the flashbacks of drug-induced days in flophouses. No soft soap was applied to the plot of the book and no sordid detail was omitted.

I was also concerned about how engaging the screenplay could be with just one main character occupying 90+% of the plot. The solitary days of trudging on the Pacific Crest Trail were interspersed with many flashbacks where Cheryl's past life is revealed - everything that lead up to her decision to attempt the PCT alone and relatively unprepared. That, combined with the occasional through hikers and other menacing characters that she met along the way, keeps the plot from being too repetitive.

I loved Laura Dern in the role as Cheryl's deceased mom. Her fun-loving quirkiness and devotion to her small family as a single mom, made it easy to see how her loss had devastated Cheryl to the point that her life went into a tailspin. There are some powerful scenes between these two actresses.

Though both the book and film can be viewed as documentaries about what NOT to do to prepare for hiking the PCT, she does manage to complete 1,100 miles unharmed and with the strength and resolve to get on with her life in a more productive and healthy fashion. It's a classic journey of healing and self forgiveness, something we can all relate to.",1423267200,,1843,4.612804878048781
6963485,3,B00S6MBGY8,"Author Cheryl Strayed's life experiences, both before and during the Pacific Coast Trail trek at the center of ""Wild,"" were atypical. The lessons that can be gleaned from her experiences are universal, and that is part of what makes her story worth knowing. Nick Hornby's script conveys those lessons reasonably well, but it also forces the parts of Strayed's life that are particular to her into a movie template that is too generic and predictable: adjectives that belong nowhere near the name Strayed.

Cheryl's relationship with her mother is an example. Laura Dern plays the infinitely loving, terminally-ill Bobbi Strayed with aching empathy. It is a subtle performance, and a good one, but not a believable one. She is too ready with the tear-jerking words of wisdom and the saintly reactions to barbs and blows. We see her again and again in one of those slow-motion, muffled, sepia-tinged moments of idyllic joy that movies always use to signify childhood memory. A storyline about Bobbi's beloved horse is hinted at throughout the film, and its obvious outcome is jealously withheld until the end, but when it comes it is anticlimactic. The memory focuses on Cheryl's brother more than Cheryl, and it has little relevance to the theme of self-destruction that colors most of the other memories we visit. It might have worked better in another part of the narrative, perhaps closer to the cringe-inducing, toenail-related opener.

Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as Cheryl for the teenage flashbacks and the punishing trail scenes, but the parts in the middle are too great a leap for someone who seems so fundamentally, undisguisably put-together. This is exactly the kind of role, with its physical and emotional extremes, that highly successful but highly type-casted actors like Witherspoon look for when they want to show their unused depth. She wears the trailworn look well, and Cheryl's mixture of trepidation and determination are always evident on her face. But depth has its limits for every actor, and it's hard to believe that Witherspoon's Cheryl could have been so totally cavalier about her health as the real Cheryl was in her darkest times. The script does Witherspoon no favors. In the flashbacks it saddles her with a frumpy, sassy best friend archetype and a hangdog ex-lover straight out of every romantic comedy Witherspoon ever headlined. Surely Cheryl's real friend and real ex (like her real mom) had more individuality than their on-screen versions. In the present day, the screenplay shoehorns in profanity like a teenager just learning to curse, and Witherspoon has the impossible task of making it sound like the natural, seasoned cursing of an adult.

Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is its mischaracterization of long-distance hiking. The real Cheryl Strayed did choose a terrible year to walk the PCT. Heavy snows in its upper stretch kept many hikers away and made it a more lonely and dangerous trip than usual. But for maximum dramatic impact, the movie pretends that female hikers are an endangered species forever hunted by predators. It plays the rape card again and again, dimming the music and focusing on Witherspoon's expressive eyes when danger approaches. But after one shot of a particular trail marker in Oregon, I heard a woman in the row behind me say with obvious pleasure, ""I've been on that trail many times."" I've been on long hikes, too (nothing nearly as long as the PTC), and even in the less-frequented corners of national parks and on strenuous mountain ascents there are always plenty of women. Cheryl, in her highly particular experience, may have felt threatened and marginalized because of her gender. If so it makes her great perseverance all the more admirable. But by acting as if ill treatment of women is the norm on trails, the film turns a triumphant and inspirational story into a dire warning. In this way and many ""Wild"" is an unpleasant and unoriginal adaptation of a unique and worthy memoir.",1423094400,3,3978,5.033383915022762

Who hasn't at some point had to learn how to forgive themselves for something or get though grief ? This is an honest look at a  women's journey inward that we view though her outward trek.

Damaged woman Cheryl (Reese Witherspoon), braves the long hike along the Pacific Crest Trail to reconcile her past, and change her future.

What did I think?

I left this movie wanting to start hiking immediately. It is based on the real life adventures of Cheryl Strayed, played convincingly by Witherspoon. Its never boring watching Cheryl walk from southern California to the edge of Canada, across deserts and snowy mountains, transforming from determined novice to seasoned hiker. The scenery is often epic, and frequent encounters with the passers-by along the way range from the sinister to the sentimental. But the stand out is a roadside encounter with an expert on all things hobo. Theres also a kid who is so sickly sweet, youll want to throw away your birth control. Flashbacks slowly reveal the events that got her here, including the pivotal relationship with her mother and troubles with her ex-husband.

To me, that background created a richer human experience of having done things in your past that you are not proud of, yet they helped to form the person you became.  Most people can probably relate to that.
