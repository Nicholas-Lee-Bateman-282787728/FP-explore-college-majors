8073877,5,B000A343QO,I look forward to seeing this DVD. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet though. Thanks again for the DVD.,1328659200,,107,3.909090909090909
8073878,4,B000A343QO,This is a very nice overview of Ms King's Wimbledon career with some additional info on her world-wide experiences. My only gripe is that I wish there had been a lot more focus on her Wimbledon career & save the additional stuff for another DVD. She has made such a huge contribution to the game of tennis that I simply don't think any singe DVD can really do a good job. This is a DVD worth owning if you either know about her life or want to see into the life of one of the greatest players in the sport of tennis.,1181260800,3,516,4.068627450980392
