There was only one Christmas song from this DVD,Bing Crosby White Christmas, the rest of the songs was before my time, the picture clarity was poor, I didn't watch it all. I don't recommend this DVD.",1357516800,,310,4.7592592592592595
8354238,3,B00277534C,"When you order this movie check carefully. This is not Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" the movie; it is a USO show. It has talented actors and singers, but it is not the movie.",1292198400,2,176,4.363636363636363
