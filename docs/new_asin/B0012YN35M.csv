3099668,5,B0012YN35M,"My Mom is a 73 year-old, bound to a wheelchair, not able to do most of the things she loved to do.  Her doctor suggested exercise.  I decided to purchase an at-home video.  I first bought one with a lady who did the exercises on a beach, which seemed ridiculous.  Plus she couldn't stand looking at the bleached hair and the fake smile on her face. She then tried one where a woman waved paper plates around.  It was OK, but the horrible computer-generated music drove her crazy.

I decided to do some research for the next video I would get so she would actually do the exercises on a regular basis.  I came across Anne Burnell.  She is not only a Certified Personal Trainer, but she is certified to train other trainers in many disciplines of exercise, including Senior Exercise.  She teaches at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the University of Illinois in Chicago. The program is recommended by some very prominent health professionals.

I then went to the Stronger Seniors website and was able to watch clips of her senior exercise DVDs.  They are GREAT! They are done in a group setting with other seniors, to music that is both relaxing and motivating. Anne explains each exercise, the proper body position, and why it is important to do.

My Mom does them every day, often with a friend and sometimes by herself.  Since starting the program, I have returned her wheelchair to the hospital store and she only uses her walker when taking long walks. She is gardening again and feeling wonderful.  Our family and her doctor are thrilled.

I have since bought Anne's other chair exercise DVDs, the Pilates one and the Yoga.  Both are terrific, and Mom thinks the yoga is so new and an absolutely wonderful experience every time she use it.  I do the Yoga one with her!",1225065600,247,1775,4.619808306709265
3099669,5,B0012YN35M,"I sometimes think people have forgotten about senior citizens needing to get some exercise.  Since it is difficult for me to walk for very long at a time and not wanting to lose what mobility I have...this is a blessing....PLEASE remember to not overdo but to do what you can...in moderation in any exercise.  God bless you all.

THIS would be a good gift for your parents...and it would encourage them if you encouraged them to try to keep flexible.  We all want to stay out of nursing homes and most of us don't want to be a burden on our children, so this a great gift to give someone you love.",1223596800,36,597,4.303571428571429
3099670,5,B0012YN35M,"After my father's passing last year, I moved my 85 year-old mother in with me. She's active for her age, but recently started having trouble with balance, getting out of her recliner, and out of the tub. I did a search on Amazon for chair exercises and came across this set. I ordered it a couple of months ago and it has made a tremendous difference in Mom 's mobility and comfort.

The set comes with two DVDs; one has a stretching routine and the other has strength and balance exercises. Each routine is about 45 minutes long and are mostly done in a sturdy kitchen chair. Although I got these for Mom's benefit, my partner and I (both in late 50's) have taken to doing the exercises with Mom. We alternate the two DVD's 5-6 days a week and we've all three noted that we feel much better. I've bought other exercise DVDs, but they tend to have young contortionists leading the program. The routines are usually too hard and we end up hurting something and quitting. With this set I feel like I get about 70 percent of the benefit of a more intense stretching and arm strength workout with about 5 percent of the pain and injury. For example, for the weightlifing section, Mom uses 3 pound weights and I use 5 pound weights. We've both seen significant improvements in arm and shoulder flexibility and strength. The most important gain has been in Mom's balance and stability. She can now get out of her recliner easily, and she's much less tottery when she walks.

I've been so impressed with the gains we've all made that I've ordered the set for my older sister and the mothers of several close friends. I've also shown the set to my physician and Mom's physician. They're both going to recommend to other patients. Given the high prevalence and serious consequences of falls in the elderly, I urge you to invest in this for any elderly loved one. My partner and I do other weekly excersises (walking, kayaking, Wii Fit, biking), but still find a lot of benefit in the exercises on these DVDs. My Mom likes the fact that the folks doing the exercises on the video are more like her than in most videos.

The only issue you might have is helping an elderly person set up the DVD player and change the discs every day. Mom couldn't get the hang of the TiVo and DVD remotes, so it's good that she has me here. Also, you might watch your senior the first time or two to make sure they are doing the exercises correctly so as to not strain anything. Mom took a little coaching on some of the forms. Now she's a pro.

I ordered two other DVDs in the Stronger Seniors series (Yoga and Pilates). Neither of those worked as well for us. The yoga was too hard for Mom and we didn't like the second instructor as well as the original instructor. The Pilates DVD uses stretch bands, but the exercises seem less intense and helpful. Surprisingly, Mom didn't like it as well because the workout is a few minutes shorter.

Sorry for the long review, but I can't over emphasize how pleased our family is with these DVDs. I urge you to get this for your own health or for any senior you care about. FYI, I had never heard of Anne Pringle Burnell before I found these DVDs in an Amazon search. Now she's a hero at our house.",1223164800,813,3212,4.391596638655463

Give the other ""popular brand"" a good run for the money! Easy to follow, safe but still offering a challenge.  Will definitely help develope balance and muscle.",1520812800,,293,4.528301886792453
3099674,5,B0012YN35M,"Believe we have all of Annes DVDs. They are all great! As a group even better because you can rotate, having a different one each time you exercise. This lets you emphasize different areas. To start might suggest this DVD set and one of the core/yoga DVDs. You can see samples of the videos on the Stronger Senior website.

We like these chair exercises because one of us has a foot that can fuss from too much use and another a knee/hip that appreciates less pounding. Anne has an pleasing way of doing the exercises. She offers modifications if you have less flexibility in an area and less strenuous ways to build up. She reminds you you can stop and finish another day. That is good and encouraging for both body and mind. There is no failure here. Doing only warmups for several days, or every other day, will get you stronger and more flexible.

Doing full Workouts, especially disk 2 of this set will give you a great workout. The DVD using the ball and another with the Bands are also great strength building workouts. We just got the HIIT DVD and believe those 3 workouts will add variety and increase our endurance. We can do the HIIT alone or add to another workout. There is great flexibility in how you use these DVDs.

Have no affiliation with Anne and bought our DVDs over several years.",1519948800,2,1302,4.485232067510548

I also have an autoimmune conditions which leaves me exhausted if I try to exercise in what people would consider a more normal fashion.  This does not make me feel like I have to lay down and recuperate.  I am becoming more flexible and stronger.  Just what I needed.

3099765,5,B0012YN35M,"-WHY I BOUGHT IT
- I am 62 and under chemotherapy for lymphoma and wanted exercise that I COULD DO as it is recommended to exercise during and after chemo.
- I have exercised on and off my whole life starting in my 20s and it always makes me feel better -- gives me a mental, emotional, and physical boost
- Due to the chemo I have lost (hopefully temporarily!) energy and stamina so standing to exercise is not an option for me now
- Wanted both stretch and strength as both are important as I have taken the shape of a chair after working in offices for 38 years and tend to carry a lot of shoulder and neck tension
- Positive reviews

PROS
- the Instructor! She is obviously a very kind and warm person with a calming voice. Important to me to have caring instructors
- the STRETCH routine works on the upper body (neck, shoulders, arms, waist) and includes hamstring stretches along with core strength
exercises so it is a complete routine
- music works underneath the routine and does not overwhelm it and is positive and calming to listen to
- you can modify the routine to suit your needs; today i just did the upper body routines as I strained a muscle in my lower back
- I felt a difference right away in my upper body and in my energy
- I would recommend to people of all ages

CONS
- Stretch is 44 minutes which may be a little long for the time conscious but the flip side is it does give you a total body workout.

I will review the STRENGTH video when I do it.

Well worth the money. A very well thought out routine with good visual cues to keep you focused. Thanks Anne! BTW I was given the all clear for the cancer. I write about it because there may be other cancer patients looking for something they can do while in therapy.

9/20/16 Strength Program
I found myself laughing while doing this program -- it is fun and uplifting. There are 3 parts: warm ups and aerobics, weights, and balance. I was able to do the whole thing and greatly enjoyed it. This week I am challenging myself to do the entire dvd with stretch one day and strength the next. I am looking forward to seeing the results. a great find and a great buy!",1472342400,27,2140,4.222493887530562

I did not watch it thru like I normally do when I purchase workout videos, because I thought it would be a breeze.  I have been doing the Walk videos and walking on the treadmill a lot and thought this would be great to give my feet/ankles a break.  And that is the only break I got.  I did this using a folding chair, although it is recommended that you use a kitchen/dining table chair because some of the moves will have you leaning and lifting in ways that will not work properly with a folding chair.

3099792,5,B0012YN35M,"There are many fitness DVDs out there, often purchase  then find routine too hard, too boring,so interest is lost quickly. However I was pleasantly surprised with this one!  The instructor, Ms. Burnell has a pleasant encouraging approach.  She often reminds you to do what feels good to your body.  No pressure here just relaxing yet beneficial workout.  Since I had major surgery a year ago exercise has not been a priority. Have been afraid that I might strain a muscle.  However, this is very gentle and since done in a chair, easier on your back. Modifications are offered as well for the more difficult moves.  After doing some light gardening my back was sore. Rested for awhile then did the stretching workout. Must say I actually felt better, could feel my sore muscles relax. Dont let the title Stronger Seniors scare you!  While not considered a senior myself yet, this routine is very good for those of us with back pain. Two discs are included.  The second disc uses weights or do the movements without any if you choose.  -Thanks Ms. Burnell for producing this gentle workout!-",1463788800,78,1090,4.780748663101604

The instructor is not only beautiful to look at, but she takes her time, and I like her comparisons of the exercise to actions - like pulling the curtain across, rowing the boat, pouring a drink, etc. I believe the exercises cover all of the body. Today I did the strength video which uses a weight. I could really feel it. She recommends alternating the two programs. The other one is stretching, which is thorough and nice. She shows you that you can get a great workout sitting on a chair. If I get bored with this set, I will no doubt order some of her other DVDs.

3099873,3,B0012YN35M,"Purchasing exercise DVD's can be very difficult, because those programs that would be appropriate for one person may not be so for another.  When reading 5-star reviews one might be tempted to think ""wow, this looks great"", but here's the question: what are the capabilities of the person writing the review?  What one person might find challenging and invigorating, another person might find boring.  I have a closet full of exercise DVD's.  Some of them were great for an earlier time in my life, but I cannot work with them now - I would injure myself.  I am 68, and I have disc herniation in my lower back.  I cannot get on the floor - or let me say if I did, it would be very difficult to get back up again!  I cannot do kicks, either forward or backward or to the side.  Therefore, I purchased this video.  Truth be told, I purchased ALL of her videos.  I like her perky spirit.  However, they are too easy for me.  Feels like a waste of my time.  I intend to keep them, however. I may find I need them in a few years.  If you're unsure about any exercise DVD, I recommend checking YouTube.  Sometimes you can find a short segment of the workout there.  Another idea is to check your local library, which I do very often.  Bring it home, work with it, and then, if you like it, come back here and buy it from Amazon!",1434585600,42,1322,4.266129032258065

(form of arthritis). it was easier to sit,&  not move because of pain.of course you then have more and bigger  problems with walking, standing and you are  just plain weak. sitting all day  your  muscles get weak very fast when not in use. I was crying because I couldn't even get out of a chair let alone walk a few feet with feeling like my legs would give out and the pain..I can't tell you how much I hurt.  the doctor told me to start exercising and to take it slow.  I was physically fit until age 70. when I was diagnose with PMR and asthma.  I had to look for senior exercise as I'm 74 and can't bounce around anymore.  I bought this exercise program because of the ratings.  its wonderful.  use this 5 to 6 days week. alternating discs.  i feel great.  i can now get out of the chair with no assistance and walk further than i have in a long time. I almost feel like myself again.  I recommend this to everyone 60 years and above (50's too) no need to jump around for exercise. Ann Pringle Burnell is awesome in leading the exercise.  I have been using this for two weeks.  what a difference in the way i feel and move. you get a total body workout sitting in a  chair.  I was so weak and now I'm getting stronger by the day.  do not hesitate to get ""stronger seniors"". My husband and friends notice the difference in the way I'm moving.

Some of the moves in the ""official"" balance routine on this dvd I can no longer do but I improvise where necessary.  I like Anne's voice (important to me) and find the pace perfect.

3099926,5,B0012YN35M,"I really like this series for my morning workout. My comments here is about the first disc on stretching. I may be a little stiff some mornings  and this gets me going gradually. The pace and direction is perfect, covers the entire body and I feel great and energized when I finish. I  like that there is not a lot of extra talk about the exercise but just clear cueing. I also especially like the visual descriptions of the exercises, pulling the curtains, picking flowers, khaking etc that let you tap into your personal memory bank for enjoyment. The simple elegant music is excellent also and subtly enhances the exercise...you can hear the waves or the sunlight at different times/exercises.

Of course I am way out of shape but this DVD makes it comfortable to get into shape while still working up a good sweat and getting your heart rate elevated. You can put as much or as little effort into it as you care to. I have lots of room for improvement but Anne Pringle Burnell really coaches you to do what your body can handle right now! Her directions are slow enough that you can keep up and the music fits so well with the motions you are doing at the time. I am not quite a senior but this was one of the only videos I could find that met my needs. I bought it based on the other customer reviews and I am so glad I did! The Stretch DVD is all sitting in a sturdy straight back chair. The Strength DVD is approximately 43 minutes of seated and 10 minutes of standing. You also need one dumb bell at a weight you'll be able to repeatedly lift with one arm. I have been doing this DVD almost every day for 2 weeks and I can already feel the changes in strength and flexibility! I must say ""thank you"" to Stronger Seniors and a special ""thanks"" to Anne Pringle Burnell.

One disc is for 'strength' exercises and the other disc is for 'stretching' exercises.  The only equipment needed for the viewer is a 1- or 2-pound hand weight (or can of peas) for a 15-minute segment during the 'strength' disc.  There is a short segment that requires standing up and holding onto a chair.  All other exercises are seated.

I was so disappointed and even if it would not have worked for my 59 year old body, I was hoping it would work for my cousin's 90 year old body. No go on both. Do not waste your time on this and if anyone can recommend one that actually is healthy for the body and shows proper techniques, I would love to know which ones to purchase.  I wanted one that does all the things this one says, but I have no idea which one that might be and was strictly going on reviews for this purchase.

Perhaps it is because I was a Kinesiology major that made me so critical of this video but I know that there are basics in exercising that cannot be ignored and if your form is not proper, you are wasting your time and also can injure your body.",1401321600,24,1001,4.149484536082475

The DVD is perfect because the instructor is easy to understand, the background setting is nice and the exercises are effective.

I didn't realize how out of shape I am until I finished the stretching.  However, after 2 more times, my body and lower back started to feel alive again and more nimble.  I liked that Anne, the instructor, was excellent to follow and gave some adaptations if a person needed to modify the stretching.  The ""strengthening"" video was really great too.  It moves at a faster pace, and some of the exercises are done standing up (with chair assistance).  I couldn't do all of them, but I still got a good workout.

I have had a desk job my entire career and I am paying for the lack of movement in my lower back and hips now that I'm older. Now, in retirement, I am trying to un-do some of the damage.

I have a dozen DVDs in this genre, and this is hands down the best I've ever run across. I highly recommend it.",1390608000,8,707,4.00709219858156
3100007,5,B0012YN35M,"Anne's DVD has 2 discs: 'stretch' and 'strength.' My 88-year-old mother performs 40 minutes daily with these discs, alternating each day with the two. She also does ""Ageless Yoga with John"" which is wonderful too. Increases circulation, works BOTH halves of the brain, raises mood/endorphins, empowers her and encourages her as she watches seniors and 'just everyday folk' (not young hot bodies) doing the exercises with her onscreen.

I highly recommend them for your loved one at home or at any senior facility.",1390608000,2,513,5.180722891566265
3100008,4,B0012YN35M,This works well for me as I'm overweight and have RA in my joints and can't stand for a long time.  The stretches feel good and I can do everything.  Yes it's slow and I could see where some people might think it's boring but for me it's great.  I haven't tried the second DVD yet.,1390262400,3,281,3.982142857142857
3100009,5,B0012YN35M,I purchased this for my 92-year old mother and she does the exercises along with the video every day.

I highly recommend this series.,1390003200,,310,4.6

3100011,5,B0012YN35M,"I ordered this because I am a 67 yr old senior and have a lot of knee and leg problems.  I thought that maybe it would be ""lame"" but was pleasantly surprised with the variety of exercises and that I felt like I had accomplished something when I was done. I wish the 1st disc would have a good place that it could be stopped and then finished later. The second one is great, it has segments that one can stop and either do later or the next day which is what I usually do because it is about 55 minutes long.  It has a variety of exercises for coordination, balance, cardio, aerobics and weights.  There are a few exercises that are done  standing but you can hold onto a chair so I did not find them difficult to do.  I would recommend this to anyone that has difficulty standing or with balance. I need something to motivate me to exercise so this works great for me. I just ordered her other Stronger Seniors with the bands, I have not tried it yet, but wanted a variety to change up so I do not get bored.  In my opinion I thought this was well worth the price I paid since you get 2 discs.",1388707200,3,1093,4.08411214953271

I read all these positive reviews about how good Anne Pringle's chair exercises are, I decided to buy the Stronger Seniors and the Stretch and Strength DVD's.  At first I thought it would be too easy for me, but I quickly discovered I lacked balance and stability. So I played her videos daily and slowly could feel myself gaining more confidence. Anne's voice is soothing and easy to listen to. I'm 62 and this is just what I need.

3100018,4,B0012YN35M,The instructor has a group of really old people sitting in chairs doing exercise. She runs a good class and puts you through a whole series of stretches then some chair weights. I felt the aerobics section was best done standing. There is no room for improvement if you are more fit. It seems geared to 80 year olds in chairs. I am 63 and would have liked to see some more advanced moves as well. Also more emphasis on knee exercises and balance would have been more to my liking.,1387238400,4,480,4.285714285714286

The workout is not very difficult, but would be good for someone who can't stand for long periods or who is just getting back into exercise.  Or for seniors.",1386806400,,380,4.626865671641791

3100025,5,B0012YN35M,"I purchased this DVD set for my overweight mother who is disabled and suffers from significant dementia. During the summer, we can take her for walks every day for exercise, but with the colder weather, it is no longer possible. Maintaining her mobility to at least walk with a walker is critical to keeping her at home, so I needed a way for her to get some exercise on a daily basis during the winter. This DVD set has been great! Almost all of the exercise segments are done completely sitting, Anne Burnell is a very calming and patient instructor and my Mom really enjoys doing the videos. She does the Strength video on the morning, then the Stretching video in the afternoon. It keeps her moving and stretching and she enjoys the mental stimulation of following the instructions. Her caregivers do the videos with her and love them as well! I'd recommend these videos for anyone who is not able to stand to exercise.",1384992000,2,923,4.6

3100027,3,B0012YN35M,"If you have Myasthenia Gravis, this DVD is not for you.  There are too many reps of a given movement, and too many movements back-to-back that exercise the same muscle groups.  You would quickly find your muscle strength used up.  This is true of both the stretching and the strengthening discs.  Otherwise, it is a well-done program and my 76 year old husband is eager to try it out.  I am 71, on a 3-hour regimen of mestinon, and I tire and become breathless easily.  I have found more benefit from Catherine MacRae's Gentle Fitness DVD.  Catherine herself has MS, and is obviously fit and flexible.  She is very positive, kind, and especially very clear as she demonstrates and guides you through her workout.  The number of reps is doable for me, and she moves you around from muscle group to muscle group so no one group gets overtired.  You get good stretches all over, some mild aerobics, plus a wide variety of short workouts to choose from, most done seated in a chair.",1384214400,6,978,4.568965517241379

It has been a challenge for me to get down and up off the floor for any exercises. Chair exercises seem to be the ticket, and when you travel, just take the DVD along. You might need a hand weight, and a resistance band.

The weights section is good, too. The aerobic section is done while sitting in a chair, but you could do it on your feet if you wanted to. On one DVD there are 4 sections that you can do individually or you can do the whole program which is warm-up, aerobic, weights, and stretching. The other DVD is a longer stretching routine.

I am unable to do the balance section on the second disc, as I am unable to stand for a long time without my walker, but will try this as soon as I feel stronger with the other parts.

Over the last year or two it has become almost impossible for me to stay on my feet (without excruciating pain) for more than a few minutes at a time. I've never been an athlete but I've always done ""something"" be it walking or swimming or aerobics classes and I had reached the point where I really couldn't do any of those.

I have used the strength video mostly. The stretch only a few times but  I do the entire strength video three times a week. In between, I do the warm-up and balance portions of the strength video. I'm always amazed at how the seemingly simple moves that Anne uses get to every part of your body. We all know to lean forward to stretch our back but how many of us think to put our hands on our thigh and lean to the right and then the left? It exercises a whole other area of your back!

I have recommended this to an 83 year old friend of mine who is even more chair bound than I and have sent a set to my sister and her husband who have similar problems.

The strength program is exercising the entire body.  The exercises are not so hard as to have sore muscles the next day but seem to be very effective.  The strength exercises are very good, little stretching, little arobics, a little lifting weights, and a little balance. Each disc is 40 min. so the exercises are done at a fairly slow pace.

He has been doing these excercises for about 4 weeks now and likes the sessions and the fact that it is getting easier for him to move and not get winded.

The thing I didn't like is the fact that she is not consistent with the count. Sometimes she will do 12 movements with the right side & when you switch you might only do 8.

I also like the fact that the disc starts immediately after you put it in the dvd player.  My mother can't read English very well as she's a Chinese Immigrant, so she always gets stuck in DVDS where people have to hit play, which is practically all DVDS.

I have started doing these exercises while sitting on my chair in the office. Couldn't believe that my back pain has reduced to a great extent and its just been a month i have started doing it. Besides, after starting doing these excrs i am now able to experience a sound sleep. Every night i use to have a considerable discomfort or rather pain in my back when i use to lay on the bed. But these excrs have surely helped me to strengthen my back making my home to offc travel much less frustrating and a sound sleep as well.
These excrs seem simple but are way more effective than what they seem to be.

well, in only 2 weeks, this set of DVDs has begun to change my life by increasing my flexibility, strength and balance!  i have tried MANY other videos before now, but the increased knee pain indicated that either the exercises weren't for me and/or i wasn't doing them correctly.

the stronger seniors series is a keeper!  i've even lost 10 pounds during this same 2-week period!  now, that could be due to being more aware of my health and fitness combined with the additional motion - i don't really care WHY it happened, so much as being ECSTATIC THAT it has happened!  yay!

i recently bought a house with my mom, and tonight is our first shot @ exercising together, using the Strength DVD - this is the one that just about covers it all!  i could easily forego using the other DVDs & stick to using the 2 DVDs in this set - but, hey, i already have them AND they're good, so i know i'll keep using them ALL!

as a matter of fact, i created my own DAILY work-out schedule, by assigning a DVD rotation day-by-day, in hopes that the variety [AND RESULTS!] will keep me going!

now, i'm looking forward to sharing a different type of mother-daughter time with my mom!  she's still young at heart & is open to a new challenge that will benefit her health - so, it's definitely a win-win for us!

i heartily recommend ANY of these DVDs for folks young & old with physical challenges who want to either get started and/or keep it going!  get going & good luck MOVING closer to your healthy goals!!",1331856000,24,1747,4.254545454545455

We can, without reservation, say we've benefited in both capacities, in our own personal home use, and as seniors doing senior fitness instruction (chair standing and mat based.)

Anne provides a complete spectrum of useful movements, including mentions of precautions and modifications.

If you are using these for personal use, the pacing and information is invaluable.

If you are teaching, all the above plus observing the amiable sometimes humorous manner that Anne approaches her class, is something to take, internalize, and make your own.

And, if you are a person more fit than the (unfortunately) typical senior, these chair-based workouts are absolutely perfect as a cross-training recovery set.  Many times we are too tired to do another full set of Jazzercise or Zumba, and these are perfect for recovery, stretching, and toning.",1330992000,8,940,5.151315789473684

I am very impressed with the sessions.  Our residents find Anne very easy to follow and understand.  While the workouts leave them feeling like they've just exerted themselves, they haven't expressed that the exercises are too difficult or strenuous on them.

Our residents are used to exercising for 30 minutes at a stretch so I think the 45 and 50 minute timeframes are a bit of an adjustment - and perhaps a little long - for them, but they're able to complete the whole workout just the same.  I also was slightly disappointed to learn that there are standing exercises at the end of the strengthening DVD; I was under the impression that the whole workout was done from a seated position.  Some of the standing exercises seem to be somewhat difficult for someone with poor balance.

At present I have little to no stamina, and it is a struggle even to walk from one room in my home to another. Standing up for more than a minute and going up stairs are both very, very difficult for me. I am confident, however, that these exercises will help me regain strength and stamina. Since I have osteoarthritis in my knees, it is ideal that most of the exercises may be performed while sitting down. I find the pace of the video, the music, and Anne's personality and teaching very pleasant and helpful. The seniors featured in the DVDs are just great also. There were a couple of the exercises I tried that caused some discomfort due to my having rotator cuff injuries. However, when I felt the discomfort, I just quit and skipped that exercise. The other exercises seemed to be fine though, and I could feel those muscles working.

3100228,3,B0012YN35M,"I purchased the two-disk Stretch and Strength set.  Iam a 71 year old woman who has osteoarthritis. I am ambulatory, but unable to walk for exercise or do strong aerobics.  I have used the Stretch disk once and found the exercises to be comfortable and invigorating for the most part. Most of the stretches were doable for me except for one where you put you leg out to the side.  I had to adjust the leg position on that one.

However, I thought 44 minutes of nothing but stretches was too long. There is no logical break in the routine so you have to finish it at one sitting. In addition, the exercises were performed very very slowly, which is good for some, but I found it boring after a while.  I kept watching the display to see how much time was left - thought it would never end.

Variety is what I am looking for - 5 minutes of stretching combine with strength and mild aerobics and cool down for a total of 30-35 minutes for one disk would be perfect for me. I don't have time to spend longer at one stretch (no pun intended).

I haven't used the strength yet, but I'm guessing I'll have the same problem with it since it is 51 minutes long.",1245110400,222,1152,4.232876712328767
3100229,5,B0012YN35M,"As an experienced fitness professional, I bought this video to get some ideas for working with seniors who are in need of strength and balance assistance.  I have to say, Anne did a terrific job.  The workouts/routines are uncomplicated yet interesting, basic but still challenging (from what I could tell), and they should be safe for this population.  I particularly liked the strength progression; the transition from body resistance to the use of weights was smooth and the increase in intensity seemed appropriately challenging.  The camera work was also done well-zooming in to the lower body and feet when a step could be a bit complicated.

These chair exercises are performed in a perfect pace, with music that is great- you do not grow tired of it after playing several times.  The Stronger Seniors exercise programs provide so much variety, I never get bored.  I feel better, look better, think better and feel much happier.

3334165,5,B0012YN35M,"My Mom is a 73 year-old, bound to a wheelchair, not able to do most of the things she loved to do.  Her doctor suggested exercise.  I decided to purchase an at-home video.  I first bought one with a lady who did the exercises on a beach, which seemed ridiculous.  Plus she couldn't stand looking at the bleached hair and the fake smile on her face. She then tried one where a woman waved paper plates around.  It was OK, but the horrible computer-generated music drove her crazy.

I decided to do some research for the next video I would get so she would actually do the exercises on a regular basis.  I came across Anne Burnell.  She is not only a Certified Personal Trainer, but she is certified to train other trainers in many disciplines of exercise, including Senior Exercise.  She teaches at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the University of Illinois in Chicago. The program is recommended by some very prominent health professionals.

I then went to the Stronger Seniors website and was able to watch clips of her senior exercise DVDs.  They are GREAT! They are done in a group setting with other seniors, to music that is both relaxing and motivating. Anne explains each exercise, the proper body position, and why it is important to do.

My Mom does them every day, often with a friend and sometimes by herself.  Since starting the program, I have returned her wheelchair to the hospital store and she only uses her walker when taking long walks. She is gardening again and feeling wonderful.  Our family and her doctor are thrilled.

I have since bought Anne's other chair exercise DVDs, the Pilates one and the Yoga.  Both are terrific, and Mom thinks the yoga is so new and an absolutely wonderful experience every time she use it.  I do the Yoga one with her!",1225065600,247,1775,4.619808306709265

Since it is difficult for me to walk for very long at a time and not wanting to lose what mobility I have...this is a blessing....PLEASE remember to not overdo but to do what you can...in moderation in any exercise.  God bless you all.

THIS would be a good gift for your parents...and it would encourage them if you encouraged them to try to keep flexible.  We all want to stay out of nursing homes and most of us don't want to be a burden on our children, so this a great gift to give someone you love.",1223596800,36,597,4.303571428571429
3334167,5,B0012YN35M,"After my father's passing last year, I moved my 85 year-old mother in with me. She's active for her age, but recently started having trouble with balance, getting out of her recliner, and out of the tub. I did a search on Amazon for chair exercises and came across this set. I ordered it a couple of months ago and it has made a tremendous difference in Mom 's mobility and comfort.

The set comes with two DVDs; one has a stretching routine and the other has strength and balance exercises. Each routine is about 45 minutes long and are mostly done in a sturdy kitchen chair. Although I got these for Mom's benefit, my partner and I (both in late 50's) have taken to doing the exercises with Mom. We alternate the two DVD's 5-6 days a week and we've all three noted that we feel much better. I've bought other exercise DVDs, but they tend to have young contortionists leading the program. The routines are usually too hard and we end up hurting something and quitting. With this set I feel like I get about 70 percent of the benefit of a more intense stretching and arm strength workout with about 5 percent of the pain and injury. For example, for the weightlifing section, Mom uses 3 pound weights and I use 5 pound weights. We've both seen significant improvements in arm and shoulder flexibility and strength. The most important gain has been in Mom's balance and stability. She can now get out of her recliner easily, and she's much less tottery when she walks.

I've been so impressed with the gains we've all made that I've ordered the set for my older sister and the mothers of several close friends. I've also shown the set to my physician and Mom's physician. They're both going to recommend to other patients. Given the high prevalence and serious consequences of falls in the elderly, I urge you to invest in this for any elderly loved one. My partner and I do other weekly excersises (walking, kayaking, Wii Fit, biking), but still find a lot of benefit in the exercises on these DVDs. My Mom likes the fact that the folks doing the exercises on the video are more like her than in most videos.

The only issue you might have is helping an elderly person set up the DVD player and change the discs every day. Mom couldn't get the hang of the TiVo and DVD remotes, so it's good that she has me here. Also, you might watch your senior the first time or two to make sure they are doing the exercises correctly so as to not strain anything. Mom took a little coaching on some of the forms. Now she's a pro.

I ordered two other DVDs in the Stronger Seniors series (Yoga and Pilates). Neither of those worked as well for us. The yoga was too hard for Mom and we didn't like the second instructor as well as the original instructor. The Pilates DVD uses stretch bands, but the exercises seem less intense and helpful. Surprisingly, Mom didn't like it as well because the workout is a few minutes shorter.

Sorry for the long review, but I can't over emphasize how pleased our family is with these DVDs. I urge you to get this for your own health or for any senior you care about. FYI, I had never heard of Anne Pringle Burnell before I found these DVDs in an Amazon search. Now she's a hero at our house.",1223164800,813,3212,4.391596638655463

3334171,5,B0012YN35M,"Believe we have all of Annes DVDs. They are all great! As a group even better because you can rotate, having a different one each time you exercise. This lets you emphasize different areas. To start might suggest this DVD set and one of the core/yoga DVDs. You can see samples of the videos on the Stronger Senior website.

We like these chair exercises because one of us has a foot that can fuss from too much use and another a knee/hip that appreciates less pounding. Anne has an pleasing way of doing the exercises. She offers modifications if you have less flexibility in an area and less strenuous ways to build up. She reminds you you can stop and finish another day. That is good and encouraging for both body and mind. There is no failure here. Doing only warmups for several days, or every other day, will get you stronger and more flexible.

Doing full Workouts, especially disk 2 of this set will give you a great workout. The DVD using the ball and another with the Bands are also great strength building workouts. We just got the HIIT DVD and believe those 3 workouts will add variety and increase our endurance. We can do the HIIT alone or add to another workout. There is great flexibility in how you use these DVDs.

3334262,5,B0012YN35M,"-WHY I BOUGHT IT
- I am 62 and under chemotherapy for lymphoma and wanted exercise that I COULD DO as it is recommended to exercise during and after chemo.
- I have exercised on and off my whole life starting in my 20s and it always makes me feel better -- gives me a mental, emotional, and physical boost
- Due to the chemo I have lost (hopefully temporarily!) energy and stamina so standing to exercise is not an option for me now
- Wanted both stretch and strength as both are important as I have taken the shape of a chair after working in offices for 38 years and tend to carry a lot of shoulder and neck tension
- Positive reviews

PROS
- the Instructor! She is obviously a very kind and warm person with a calming voice. Important to me to have caring instructors
- the STRETCH routine works on the upper body (neck, shoulders, arms, waist) and includes hamstring stretches along with core strength
exercises so it is a complete routine
- music works underneath the routine and does not overwhelm it and is positive and calming to listen to
- you can modify the routine to suit your needs; today i just did the upper body routines as I strained a muscle in my lower back
- I felt a difference right away in my upper body and in my energy
- I would recommend to people of all ages

CONS
- Stretch is 44 minutes which may be a little long for the time conscious but the flip side is it does give you a total body workout.

I will review the STRENGTH video when I do it.

Well worth the money. A very well thought out routine with good visual cues to keep you focused. Thanks Anne! BTW I was given the all clear for the cancer. I write about it because there may be other cancer patients looking for something they can do while in therapy.

9/20/16 Strength Program
I found myself laughing while doing this program -- it is fun and uplifting. There are 3 parts: warm ups and aerobics, weights, and balance. I was able to do the whole thing and greatly enjoyed it. This week I am challenging myself to do the entire dvd with stretch one day and strength the next. I am looking forward to seeing the results. a great find and a great buy!",1472342400,27,2140,4.222493887530562

I did not watch it thru like I normally do when I purchase workout videos, because I thought it would be a breeze.  I have been doing the Walk videos and walking on the treadmill a lot and thought this would be great to give my feet/ankles a break.  And that is the only break I got.  I did this using a folding chair, although it is recommended that you use a kitchen/dining table chair because some of the moves will have you leaning and lifting in ways that will not work properly with a folding chair.

3334289,5,B0012YN35M,"There are many fitness DVDs out there, often purchase  then find routine too hard, too boring,so interest is lost quickly. However I was pleasantly surprised with this one!  The instructor, Ms. Burnell has a pleasant encouraging approach.  She often reminds you to do what feels good to your body.  No pressure here just relaxing yet beneficial workout.  Since I had major surgery a year ago exercise has not been a priority. Have been afraid that I might strain a muscle.  However, this is very gentle and since done in a chair, easier on your back. Modifications are offered as well for the more difficult moves.  After doing some light gardening my back was sore. Rested for awhile then did the stretching workout. Must say I actually felt better, could feel my sore muscles relax. Dont let the title Stronger Seniors scare you!  While not considered a senior myself yet, this routine is very good for those of us with back pain. Two discs are included.  The second disc uses weights or do the movements without any if you choose.  -Thanks Ms. Burnell for producing this gentle workout!-",1463788800,78,1090,4.780748663101604

The instructor is not only beautiful to look at, but she takes her time, and I like her comparisons of the exercise to actions - like pulling the curtain across, rowing the boat, pouring a drink, etc. I believe the exercises cover all of the body. Today I did the strength video which uses a weight. I could really feel it. She recommends alternating the two programs. The other one is stretching, which is thorough and nice. She shows you that you can get a great workout sitting on a chair. If I get bored with this set, I will no doubt order some of her other DVDs.

I've noticed when I do this tape my blood sugar is better the next day. I am unsteady (balance issues) and use a walker, so the seated exercises are good for me.  Ms. Burnell also has a calming pleasant voice; which helps.  I had some walking tapes (done in your home) and the person leading the group became very annoying to me after a while.  I had to start playing it with the mute button on.  I had done it enough times that I could view only and keep up.

3334370,3,B0012YN35M,"Purchasing exercise DVD's can be very difficult, because those programs that would be appropriate for one person may not be so for another.  When reading 5-star reviews one might be tempted to think ""wow, this looks great"", but here's the question: what are the capabilities of the person writing the review?  What one person might find challenging and invigorating, another person might find boring.  I have a closet full of exercise DVD's.  Some of them were great for an earlier time in my life, but I cannot work with them now - I would injure myself.  I am 68, and I have disc herniation in my lower back.  I cannot get on the floor - or let me say if I did, it would be very difficult to get back up again!  I cannot do kicks, either forward or backward or to the side.  Therefore, I purchased this video.  Truth be told, I purchased ALL of her videos.  I like her perky spirit.  However, they are too easy for me.  Feels like a waste of my time.  I intend to keep them, however. I may find I need them in a few years.  If you're unsure about any exercise DVD, I recommend checking YouTube.  Sometimes you can find a short segment of the workout there.  Another idea is to check your local library, which I do very often.  Bring it home, work with it, and then, if you like it, come back here and buy it from Amazon!",1434585600,42,1322,4.266129032258065

(form of arthritis). it was easier to sit,&  not move because of pain.of course you then have more and bigger  problems with walking, standing and you are  just plain weak. sitting all day  your  muscles get weak very fast when not in use. I was crying because I couldn't even get out of a chair let alone walk a few feet with feeling like my legs would give out and the pain..I can't tell you how much I hurt.  the doctor told me to start exercising and to take it slow.  I was physically fit until age 70. when I was diagnose with PMR and asthma.  I had to look for senior exercise as I'm 74 and can't bounce around anymore.  I bought this exercise program because of the ratings.  its wonderful.  use this 5 to 6 days week. alternating discs.  i feel great.  i can now get out of the chair with no assistance and walk further than i have in a long time. I almost feel like myself again.  I recommend this to everyone 60 years and above (50's too) no need to jump around for exercise. Ann Pringle Burnell is awesome in leading the exercise.  I have been using this for two weeks.  what a difference in the way i feel and move. you get a total body workout sitting in a  chair.

The instruction is very clear and the instructor has a pleasant, soothing voice.

My husband's only complaint was that it is a ""little fast"" between exercise changes, but I know once he has completed this a couple more times it will be natural for him.",1421798400,2,491,4.444444444444445

I may be a little stiff some mornings  and this gets me going gradually. The pace and direction is perfect, covers the entire body and I feel great and energized when I finish. I  like that there is not a lot of extra talk about the exercise but just clear cueing. I also especially like the visual descriptions of the exercises, pulling the curtains, picking flowers, khaking etc that let you tap into your personal memory bank for enjoyment. The simple elegant music is excellent also and subtly enhances the exercise...you can hear the waves or the sunlight at different times/exercises. I have most of the DVDs in this series, using different ones on different days and I think these are the best senior exercises out there.",1420934400,7,834,4.705479452054795

Of course I am way out of shape but this DVD makes it comfortable to get into shape while still working up a good sweat and getting your heart rate elevated. You can put as much or as little effort into it as you care to. I have lots of room for improvement but Anne Pringle Burnell really coaches you to do what your body can handle right now! Her directions are slow enough that you can keep up and the music fits so well with the motions you are doing at the time. I am not quite a senior but this was one of the only videos I could find that met my needs. I bought it based on the other customer reviews and I am so glad I did! The Stretch DVD is all sitting in a sturdy straight back chair. The Strength DVD is approximately 43 minutes of seated and 10 minutes of standing. You also need one dumb bell at a weight you'll be able to repeatedly lift with one arm. I have been doing this DVD almost every day for 2 weeks and I can already feel the changes in strength and flexibility! I must say ""thank you"" to Stronger Seniors and a special ""thanks"" to Anne Pringle Burnell.

The only equipment needed for the viewer is a 1- or 2-pound hand weight (or can of peas) for a 15-minute segment during the 'strength' disc.  There is a short segment that requires standing up and holding onto a chair.  All other exercises are seated.

I was so disappointed and even if it would not have worked for my 59 year old body, I was hoping it would work for my cousin's 90 year old body. No go on both. Do not waste your time on this and if anyone can recommend one that actually is healthy for the body and shows proper techniques, I would love to know which ones to purchase.  I wanted one that does all the things this one says, but I have no idea which one that might be and was strictly going on reviews for this purchase.

Perhaps it is because I was a Kinesiology major that made me so critical of this video but I know that there are basics in exercising that cannot be ignored and if your form is not proper, you are wasting your time and also can injure your body.",1401321600,24,1001,4.149484536082475

I didn't realize how out of shape I am until I finished the stretching.  However, after 2 more times, my body and lower back started to feel alive again and more nimble.  I liked that Anne, the instructor, was excellent to follow and gave some adaptations if a person needed to modify the stretching.  The ""strengthening"" video was really great too.  It moves at a faster pace, and some of the exercises are done standing up (with chair assistance).  I couldn't do all of them, but I still got a good workout.

This DVD makes me feel wonderful by the time I am finished. I personally use the Stretch DVD much more than the Strength one, but they are both good. It's just that I feel so darn good after finished the stretches. And it honestly feels like I've just received a full body massage.

I have had a desk job my entire career and I am paying for the lack of movement in my lower back and hips now that I'm older. Now, in retirement, I am trying to un-do some of the damage.

She also does ""Ageless Yoga with John"" which is wonderful too.

I wish the 1st disc would have a good place that it could be stopped and then finished later. The second one is great, it has segments that one can stop and either do later or the next day which is what I usually do because it is about 55 minutes long.  It has a variety of exercises for coordination, balance, cardio, aerobics and weights.  There are a few exercises that are done  standing but you can hold onto a chair so I did not find them difficult to do.  I would recommend this to anyone that has difficulty standing or with balance. I need something to motivate me to exercise so this works great for me. I just ordered her other Stronger Seniors with the bands, I have not tried it yet, but wanted a variety to change up so I do not get bored.

Maintaining her mobility to at least walk with a walker is critical to keeping her at home, so I needed a way for her to get some exercise on a daily basis during the winter. This DVD set has been great! Almost all of the exercise segments are done completely sitting, Anne Burnell is a very calming and patient instructor and my Mom really enjoys doing the videos. She does the Strength video on the morning, then the Stretching video in the afternoon. It keeps her moving and stretching and she enjoys the mental stimulation of following the instructions.

Otherwise, it is a well-done program and my 76 year old husband is eager to try it out.  I am 71, on a 3-hour regimen of mestinon, and I tire and become breathless easily.  I have found more benefit from Catherine MacRae's Gentle Fitness DVD.  Catherine herself has MS, and is obviously fit and flexible.  She is very positive, kind, and especially very clear as she demonstrates and guides you through her workout.

Over the last year or two it has become almost impossible for me to stay on my feet (without excruciating pain) for more than a few minutes at a time. I've never been an athlete but I've always done ""something"" be it walking or swimming or aerobics classes and I had reached the point where I really couldn't do any of those.

I have used the strength video mostly. The stretch only a few times but  I do the entire strength video three times a week. In between, I do the warm-up and balance portions of the strength video. I'm always amazed at how the seemingly simple moves that Anne uses get to every part of your body. We all know to lean forward to stretch our back but how many of us think to put our hands on our thigh and lean to the right and then the left? It exercises a whole other area of your back!

Right now they are gathering dust.  I may see if I can re-edit them to another CD but more likely will just chalk it off to a bad experience and give them away.

I have 4 days off a week, so I do the stretch program one day, and the next day off I do the strength program. Within a week I could feel a difference in how much I could do. The strength program is exercising the entire body.  The exercises are not so hard as to have sore muscles the next day but seem to be very effective.  The strength exercises are very good, little stretching, little arobics, a little lifting weights, and a little balance. Each disc is 40 min. so the exercises are done at a fairly slow pace.

He has been doing these excercises for about 4 weeks now and likes the sessions and the fact that it is getting easier for him to move and not get winded.

The thing I didn't like is the fact that she is not consistent with the count. Sometimes she will do 12 movements with the right side & when you switch you might only do 8.

Now that she is back on her own she hasn't touched them.  Not because she doesn't want to- she just can't remember how to make the dvd player work. That's how it goes with seniors.  :-)

*I should add that my mom is an active 74 year old who has always enjoyed life.  When she was younger she could walk so fast I could barely keep up with her.  She is only now starting to slow down, but still exercises at least three times a week.  The length of the dvd's were just fine with her and she seemed energized after completing them.",1355097600,3,681,4.067669172932331

I watched it through first and it was just what I had hoped it would be and the instructor seemed lovely too.

I have started doing these exercises while sitting on my chair in the office. Couldn't believe that my back pain has reduced to a great extent and its just been a month i have started doing it. Besides, after starting doing these excrs i am now able to experience a sound sleep. Every night i use to have a considerable discomfort or rather pain in my back when i use to lay on the bed. But these excrs have surely helped me to strengthen my back making my home to offc travel much less frustrating and a sound sleep as well.
These excrs seem simple but are way more effective than what they seem to be.

well, in only 2 weeks, this set of DVDs has begun to change my life by increasing my flexibility, strength and balance!  i have tried MANY other videos before now, but the increased knee pain indicated that either the exercises weren't for me and/or i wasn't doing them correctly.

the stronger seniors series is a keeper!  i've even lost 10 pounds during this same 2-week period!  now, that could be due to being more aware of my health and fitness combined with the additional motion - i don't really care WHY it happened, so much as being ECSTATIC THAT it has happened!  yay!

i recently bought a house with my mom, and tonight is our first shot @ exercising together, using the Strength DVD - this is the one that just about covers it all!  i could easily forego using the other DVDs & stick to using the 2 DVDs in this set - but, hey, i already have them AND they're good, so i know i'll keep using them ALL!

as a matter of fact, i created my own DAILY work-out schedule, by assigning a DVD rotation day-by-day, in hopes that the variety [AND RESULTS!] will keep me going!

now, i'm looking forward to sharing a different type of mother-daughter time with my mom!  she's still young at heart & is open to a new challenge that will benefit her health - so, it's definitely a win-win for us!

We can, without reservation, say we've benefited in both capacities, in our own personal home use, and as seniors doing senior fitness instruction (chair standing and mat based.)

Anne provides a complete spectrum of useful movements, including mentions of precautions and modifications.

If you are using these for personal use, the pacing and information is invaluable.

If you are teaching, all the above plus observing the amiable sometimes humorous manner that Anne approaches her class, is something to take, internalize, and make your own.

And, if you are a person more fit than the (unfortunately) typical senior, these chair-based workouts are absolutely perfect as a cross-training recovery set.  Many times we are too tired to do another full set of Jazzercise or Zumba, and these are perfect for recovery, stretching, and toning.",1330992000,8,940,5.151315789473684

While the workouts leave them feeling like they've just exerted themselves, they haven't expressed that the exercises are too difficult or strenuous on them.

Our residents are used to exercising for 30 minutes at a stretch so I think the 45 and 50 minute timeframes are a bit of an adjustment - and perhaps a little long - for them, but they're able to complete the whole workout just the same.  I also was slightly disappointed to learn that there are standing exercises at the end of the strengthening DVD; I was under the impression that the whole workout was done from a seated position.

I find the pace of the video, the music, and Anne's personality and teaching very pleasant and helpful. The seniors featured in the DVDs are just great also. There were a couple of the exercises I tried that caused some discomfort due to my having rotator cuff injuries. However, when I felt the discomfort, I just quit and skipped that exercise.

3334721,5,B0012YN35M,"I purchased Stronger Seniors Chair workout for my 76 year old mother hoping it would help her body be as strong as her mind. Unfortunately, my mother got sick and has not been able to use the workout DVDs. I tried them though and found them to be a great workout for my injured shoulder and lower back. At 41 years old I didn't mind working out with the older crowd. The in instructor is my age so that helped. I hope that mother will get to feeling better soon so that she can try the workout. She'll like it, I'm sure.",1252281600,6,520,4.107843137254902

If Anne Pringle Burnell has other Videos for Seniors, I would buy them in
the future....Now, when I want to buy exercise Videos, I check with Amazon.com, first.....
Thank you for letting me express my feelings about these DVD's...

3334724,5,B0012YN35M,"This is a wonderful motivational dvd that exercises the body and the mind. My dad is ill and his movement is limited at times. This is perfect for him to do because he never has to leave ""his"" chair. It gets the oxygen pumping in his body to improve his breathing and overall movement. It great!",1247356800,6,295,4.285714285714286
3334725,3,B0012YN35M,"I purchased the two-disk Stretch and Strength set.  Iam a 71 year old woman who has osteoarthritis. I am ambulatory, but unable to walk for exercise or do strong aerobics.  I have used the Stretch disk once and found the exercises to be comfortable and invigorating for the most part. Most of the stretches were doable for me except for one where you put you leg out to the side.  I had to adjust the leg position on that one.

However, I thought 44 minutes of nothing but stretches was too long. There is no logical break in the routine so you have to finish it at one sitting. In addition, the exercises were performed very very slowly, which is good for some, but I found it boring after a while.  I kept watching the display to see how much time was left - thought it would never end.

Variety is what I am looking for - 5 minutes of stretching combine with strength and mild aerobics and cool down for a total of 30-35 minutes for one disk would be perfect for me. I don't have time to spend longer at one stretch (no pun intended).

I haven't used the strength yet, but I'm guessing I'll have the same problem with it since it is 51 minutes long.",1245110400,222,1152,4.232876712328767
3334726,5,B0012YN35M,"As an experienced fitness professional, I bought this video to get some ideas for working with seniors who are in need of strength and balance assistance.  I have to say, Anne did a terrific job.  The workouts/routines are uncomplicated yet interesting, basic but still challenging (from what I could tell), and they should be safe for this population.  I particularly liked the strength progression; the transition from body resistance to the use of weights was smooth and the increase in intensity seemed appropriately challenging.  The camera work was also done well-zooming in to the lower body and feet when a step could be a bit complicated.  I'd definitely recommend this DVD to other fitness professionals and especially to seniors.",1244937600,21,740,5.184873949579832

So it is important to try to do some exercising.  This video helps.  You do most of the exercises from a chair, so it is easy on the knees.",1244419200,17,309,3.935483870967742

She cheerfully does them about 6 days per week, alternating the two as recommended. Due to Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, her balance and ability to pick up her feet are very poor.  These chair exercises are perfect for her and Anne's sensitive leadership
is very pleasant and enjoyable.  I plan to purchase another in the series soon.  Highly recommended!",1242604800,9,463,4.987012987012987

I looked for the same video on DVD, but it was old enough that it didn't come in DVD.  So, I ordered this one for her.  She found that this Stretch and Strength DVD was an excellent mix of the exercises she found helpful.

These chair exercises are performed in a perfect pace, with music that is great- you do not grow tired of it after playing several times.  The Stronger Seniors exercise programs provide so much variety, I never get bored.  I feel better, look better, think better and feel much happier.

I have since bought the Pilates and Yoga DVDs and they are both excellent.

My parents, who are 87 and 90, have benefited greatly from the class, and they enjoy it enough that they are going to order this DVD set for themselves to use when they are back up North during the summer. I went to the class with them (for moral support and encouragement) several times, too. Even though I'm 64 and very active and fit, I got some benefit from doing these exercises (particularly from the stretching). I found the instructor's instructions to be quite adequate and reasonably entertaining. She periodically reminds viewers not to do anything that is uncomfortable or unsafe and points out ways in which participants can modify the exercises to be suitable for any limitations they might have.",1523145600,,834,4.798611111111111

Doing sitting practice, upper and lower body strength workouts and lower body stretching tracks. I had to work up to the strength tracks, but felt I was ready to do some other exercise, more aerobic stuff. So I got this DVD and just did the seated Stretch workout one time. BOY what a difference. She rarely gives posture instructions and there is a lot of weird stretches for back. Bottom line is my back was killing me to point I had to take muscle relaxers for 3 days to allow them to heal.
