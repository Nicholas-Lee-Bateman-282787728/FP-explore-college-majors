1996870,5,B0001FT50A,"THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
This is the best Bible movie I've ever seen. It's sad but not surprising that the film didn't get a fair shake with mainstream reviewers. Everything about it was done professionally with beauty and heart. When a three-hour movie flies by and you are moved and wishing for more, you know it's worthy of five stars. Don't miss this one, whether or not you are a Christian.",1069804800,15,389,4.492957746478873
1996871,5,B0001FT50A,"The book of John is perhaps the most well-known book of the Bible. It is the the only non-synoptic gospel and is written in a style very different from the other three gospels.  THE GOSPEL OF JOHN is a movie version of the book that translates the words on the page unto the screen word by word.
The film is surpisingly well done. The cast is comprised of mostly ""nameless"" actors, but they do just as good a job as any ""name"" actor could ever do. Instead of the just playing characters on the screen, the cast actully seems to be playing real people. Every experession, gaze, and movement is vivid and real. The Bible truly seems to come alive upon the screen. Also, the music of the soundtrack is well done: it doesn't overshadow the action on screen, nor is it so minor that it is insignificant. Instead, it adds to the action going on, incorporating itself as an important part of the film.
Besides the acting, the thing I was most impressed about was the props, costuming, and scenery.  The movie is very accurate with the details of the era in which Jesus lived.  From the clothes the actors wear, to the boats in which the disciples fish, to the way in which Jesus is crucified, every minute detail appeared to be historical accurate. It is the way people dressed, walked, lived, and died.
In the glory days of Hollywood, Bible movies used to be made on a routine basis. The media moguls of the day knew that the Bible was rich and ripe with material that would not only make great movies, but also appeal to a large part of the population and would not offend anyone. Then the 1960s came and everything changed. Hollywood stopped making Bible pictures. They were no longer seen as being ""content"" worthy. In the past few years, Movie Land has seemed to be testing the ground again. This resurgent interest in Bible films has been lead by small, independent companies trying to make high quaility films without forsaking the messages of the Bible. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN is such a movie and if it is a foretaste of the type of Biblical movies to come in the future, we may well seen a Biblical cinematic revival.",1068940800,24,2115,4.488311688311688
1996872,5,B0001FT50A,"I was blown away by the beauty of this movie and the accuracy of the dialogue.  Coupled with the awesome THE ROCK & THE RABBI, which is a live performance showing in Orlando, one does not need to see anything else to make a decision whether Jesus is God.
This movie should be seen by everyone interested in what is happening in the Middle East right now, and those searching for answers about God, Christ and Isreal.  It is a must-see for all humans!",1068940800,15,450,4.345238095238095
1996873,5,B0001FT50A,"A word-for-word enactment of John's gospel of Jesus.  It captures the struggle between Christ as the unknown commoner  and the religious powers of the day as He declares Himself to be the Son of God. The message of the gospel comes forth clearly:  believe in Jesus and know the Father, or refuse the Son and lose the Father.  No compromises, no apologies.
The ""I Am"" declarations of Christ come to life.
It's well worth your time.  A mountain-top experience that will last for days.
I sincerely hope the team will consider similar projects for the other three gospels and the book of Acts.",1068508800,68,589,4.679611650485437
1996874,5,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John is, in my humble opinion, the best Biblical-based movie since The Gospel According to St Matthew. The Gospel of John was filmed in Toronto using unknown actors and a British director. The intent of the Producers was to present the text of the book with no embelishments or viewpoints, letting the words speak for themselves and leaving the viewer to draw their own conslusions. The film accomplished this beautifully. The result is a powerful presentation that, while three hours long, seemed to fly by. I never got bored or tired, and felt like I had been there 2 hours or less.
Sadly, it gets mediocre reviews from the ""sophisticated"" reviewers who cannot appreciate the simple beauty and power of the words as written by John without the aid of post-modern interpretation.
I understand it is only showing in limited theaters in the South, then going straight to video. If it is in a theatre in your city, go see it. If not, get the video when it comes out. It is well worth the price.",1067212800,239,1006,4.625698324022347
1996885,5,B0001FT50A,"In the Gospel of John, Jesus is demonstrated in his writing as almost God himself or to the extent that he is as powerful as God.  Johns Gospel demonstrates this in his writing style and his wording throughout the gospel.  In the other synoptic Gospels, they are filled with many miracles that Jesus did throughout his life.  However, in Johns Gospel he only writes about a certain view all of which give Jesus God like powers that no human could ever be able to do and that is what John clearly wanted to focus on.  For instance, John 2:11 where he turns water into wine which proves his powers of changing elements of the world, also in John 11:44 John raises Lazarus from the dead which is truly one of the most powerful God like things he could have ever accomplished.  In the Gospel of John, it is also important to note that he never comes out and says that Jesus is God but his use of wordplay I AM makes you feel that he believes it so. The director gives us his interpretation of I AM meaning being an agent of God. Later on he points out that he is here on Gods behalf and describes him as Gods manifest to the world. The other synoptic gospels show Jesus follows a different path and demonstrate Jesus as an amazing powerful prophet but a prophet nonetheless.  This gospel to me shows a side of admiration and respect which makes me feel that this gospel may have easily been written by someone who knew and had communications with Jesus himself.  One of his disciples is the clear favorite and John is usually the most consensual pick, but it is also believed that the final version of the gospel happened over time within 100 years after the death of Jesus.",1523145600,,1670,4.402597402597403
1996886,5,B0001FT50A,"I listen to this every year during Lent/Easter. I love the slightly British accents, the clarity of what John the Baptist and Christ were really saying, the meaning of the words and who they apply to are very clear. Seems realistic for the time period of that day and the actors who play John the Baptist and Jesus are perfect.",1522886400,,327,4.466666666666667
1996887,4,B0001FT50A,"My family rented this for Easter. I wanted to provide an accurate telling of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. This was well done as far as Biblical accuracy goes--it's pretty much John word-for-word. Some of the acting was a little odd, but I actually think that was a directorial influence rather than talent. There were a few strange shots and odd closeups, and it was really slow. If it had been an audio book I'd have increased it to 1.25x speed, if that makes any sense. Transitions took a long time, so what is a 3 hour movie easily could have been a more manageable 2.5 without losing any text. I was glad we watched it, though. If the same group did The Gospel of Matthew, I would probably buy it because it gives more of the parables and miracles with insight into Jesus' daily life.",1522713600,,797,4.465753424657534
1996888,1,B0001FT50A,"Only well rated because of zealot Christians. No sane person would watch this for knowledge, cinematography, or entertainment; only blind faith.

They could have, you know, in some  openair  greek amphitheater. because some of the first christian churches were in greece.

Most if not all the time the harsher things Jesus says or does is swept under the rug, primarily focusing solely on only His love. Don't get me wrong, that is crucially important but you need to present Him fully, as the Bible does. This is part of the reason non believers have issue with Jesus.

1996917,4,B0001FT50A,"This is a good, accurate representation of the events described in the Gospel of John, and I have to say that the director did manage to resist trying to fill in the gaps with extra-biblical scenes; so on that basis I can certainly recommend it. But as much as I appreciated its careful attention to detail on some levels, I was left puzzled at the way the actor portrayed Jesus. I found myself wondering if Henry Cusick (or was it the director?) really understood the gravity of what he was supposed to be saying at times, because it often looked like he was smiling just to smile. For me, that smiling sometimes detracted from the impact and significance of the words. His portrayal certainly didn't match Isaiah's description of Messiah as a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. In light of that description, you might expect Jesus to show in his manner and countenance the effects of those emotions, especially at key moments along the way. Then there were his encounters with stiff-necked, scornful Pharisees and other haters -- some of which could not have been nearly as civil as they were portrayed. So, as I said, it's worth watching, but try not to let the unnecessary smiling get in the way of the message.",1515024000,,1222,4.662037037037037

Movie Review
Rusti Goins

The movie the Gospel of John starts out with John in the river Baptising people. And it says that John was sharing with the people the word of God. Then John sees Jesus and he tells two other disciples that is Jesus. So they go over and follow him. Jesus then goes to a temple in Jerusalem and sees that people are selling goods and animals in the temple which makes him mad. So he knocks over all the tables with the goods and scatters the coins and his reason for doing this is because the temple is his father house and it should not be disrespected like that. Jesus goes on throughout the movie and performs many miracles the first miracle he performed is when he tells his disciples to go draw water from the buckets. So they do and when they pour the water out from the pitcher it has been turn it to wonderful wine. The next miracle he performs is when an Official from Galilee rides on horseback to see Jesus and asks Jesus to heal his son who is ill and might die of a fever. Jesus then tell the offical your son is healed and when the official returns home in two days his son is healed. The third miracle Jesus performs is when Jesus heals a blind man who had been this way since birth for 38 years. The next miracle Jesus performs is when a crowd of 5,000 gathered on a hill to listen to him speak Gods word. He wants to feed the crowd but is only given 2 fish and 5 pieces of bread by a little boy, which he then turns into enough to feed the whole crowd. It even stated the whole crowd had all they could ever want. He goes on to perform many more miracles that lead up to Mary washing Jesus feet and then finding out Judas will betray him. Next to Palm Sunday where he rides on a donkey through Jerusalem, to the Last Supper,to him being captured by the romans to Jesus being crucified and after three days he rises again. This movie relates to world religions because it tells the story of Jesus which is whom the Christian believe is the Son of God that was sent down to live on this earth and to die for our sins. Which is a very important part of the Christian belief. The last supper is also where Christians get the practice of Communion from and still practice today. The Story of John is very consistent with other teachings of the new testament as it stated at the end of the movie, that John had the most vivid and accurate descriptions of Jesus life while he was on earth. The movie accurately tells of all the miracles Jesus performed, how some people did and did not believe in him and how he was crucified and then rose again in three days.",1510444800,4,2614,4.186507936507937
1996944,4,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John walks us through the final events that occurred before the Crucifixion of Jesus. What is incredible about this movie is that it it is a word for word basis from the good news bible. It strictly follows John's Gospel exactly how it is said to be depicted with no adaptations or add-ons just for the sake of creating more drama or stretching out the story. I definitely recommend this movie, especially to those who are Christian or very interested in Christianity. I thought it was incredible how this movie did not need to include anything else for better content. We see many key events in this movie such as part of Jesus's childhood, Mary's reaction to the crucifixion. All of the characters were portrayed very much how they are known to look like. I think the best thing about this movie is the actor who played Jesus which was Ian Cusick. His look was perfect and his expressions and motions really gives you that Jesus feel of purity and holiness of a god among men. I am surprised I never saw this movie in a history class before because this movie teaches us a lot about Christianity in just three hours and also gives us a good sense of who these people were and what it may have been like to be a part of these events that occurred. It also shows the well known miracles Jesus performed such as turning water into wine and the famous last supper scene the day before Jesus was crucified. I am not a Christian so it was definitely more surprising for me. The crucifixion although was not as detailed as the Passion of Christs was but it still showed us what was necessary to still put us in the time period and moment.",1510444800,,1647,4.421052631578948
1996945,4,B0001FT50A,I thought this movie was a great example of what a lot of Christians believe in. It really does a good job in showing how powerful Jesus really is. I thought the actors in this film were also really good. Especially the person who played Jesus. You could tell he had a lot of passion and took his job very serious. I think this is a perfect religious movie if that is the type of film you are looking to watch.,1510444800,,410,4.074074074074074
1996946,5,B0001FT50A,Very well made.  Really enjoyed it.,1510012800,,35,4.833333333333333
1996947,3,B0001FT50A,"I chose to watch The Gospel of John because I watched The Pasion of Christ and wanted to compare the differences. I thought that watching this movie would be a good learning experience for me. This is a story about Jesus and His adventures through the eyes of the disciple John. This movie is very much like The Pasion of the Christ. Jesus performed many miracles such a changing water into wine and feeding thousands of people with just two fish and some bread. He also made a man walk and made a blind man see. Throughout his Journey, he was able to lead many people to become followers and believers of God. He was beaten, mocked, and tortured. Then, had to carry his cross up the mountain, Mount Calvary. When he reached the top of the mountain the soldiers nailed him to the cross. Two nails, one in each hand, and one in his feet. They placed a crown of thorns on his head and put a sign above his head that read King of Kings. He hung on that mountain for all the people of the land to see him. When he died they took him down, wrapped him and placed him in a tomb. Then the soldiers rolled a big stone in front so no one could get on or out. But even though there attempt, on the third day, Jesus rose from the dead. This was a miracle that no one had ever seen. When the stone was rolled away his body was gone.
 This was an interesting movie. I like the storyline and it is cool to hear it from one of the twelve disciples, who narrated the movie. I compared this a lot to Pasion of the Christ, as they were very similar. But there were several differences. I like how this can relate this to what I am reading in my religion class. There are many things that are culturally different from this movie to the world around us. The graphics could have been better but overall this was a pretty good movie.",1509926400,,1812,4.177142857142857

1996950,5,B0001FT50A,I absolutely love this depiction of the word of God verbatim. The man who played John the Baptist does a beautiful portrayal of this great prophet. Although he is seen much older than the Jesus actor which isn't the true age difference between them on earth (~6 mos.) I couldn't think of a better man to act out John the Baptist it was a powerful Re-enactment loved it,1508889600,,368,4.426470588235294
1996951,3,B0001FT50A,"Aside from all the general misunderstanding of the bible and how its interpreted, this film seemed to miss the mark.

Props: everyone in the film was freshly bathed, beards trimmed, and their clothes were freshly washed.  This in turn makes everything look fake.  In order to be quoted, someone other than Jesus had to be present, like for example John.  In far too many scenes Jesus was speaking out a verse without any of his disciples being present.

While He had the inner strength of a lion, Jesus was at heart a humble man, and almost certainly more serious then what was depicted.  He did after-all know he was to be crucified soon, and of course the immense burden and responsibility he carried.  Its more likely to find humility among the poor and downtrodden, this aspect should have been studied maybe even spend some time among poor tribes, in farm land, and in a 3rd world country.  These people have a vastly different look to them.  While an impossibility to play the part of a God realized man, it felt that things were not well thought out.

Jesus spent a lot of time in prayer, and no doubt encouraged the same from his disciples that seemed to be missing.  Payer; what do we really know if this word?  In certainly isn't what people call payer today, where they go on asking for one thing after another.  Jesus had no need for this, as he could have had anything He wanted.  It is however known meditation was practiced throughout that region.  Owning to the bible being an incomplete teaching, we are left with bit's and pieces of man, Word made flesh.",1508198400,,1572,4.564285714285714

1997018,5,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of john is a book of the bible that tells of Jesuss life, his purpose and his death, which is very significant. The story begins with John the Baptist, who was a prophet who prophesized of Jesuss coming. There in the lake that John the Baptist had his ministry, in the movie, it shows that Jesus baptized himself. John the Baptist told his disciples that the messiah had arrived. Immediately, Johns disciples left him and followed Jesus home. From there Jesus began his choosing of The 12 disciples. The Gospel accounts also describe Jesus as a charismatic teacher who spoke with authority on the scriptures and urged repentance and baptism in anticipation of the coming Kingdom of God (Invitation to 404, World Religion). Jesuss message described something that most did not understand, which was the baptism of fire.  John answered them all, I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire(Luke 3:16). Jesus performed many miracles and preached of salvation, being saved through the blood of Jesus Christ. Jesuss adversaries, who were the Pharisees, persistently came against Jesus, saying he was blasphemous. Eventually, Jesus prophesied that Judas, one of the disciples who would be filled with Satan, betrayed Jesus, leading the Roman guards to where Jesus would be. In closing Jesus, Jesus was crucified on the cross, and he rose 3 days later. He is the way the truth and the life.
 This relates to world religion because, it describes the beginning of this religion and why it believes what it believes, the purpose, rituals and practices.
The movie was consistent with the book, but failed to add key events because of space I am presuming. For example, Peter walked on water to Jesus, but that wasn't added. The movie also shows Jesus baptizing him self, but in the bible Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. These were the main inconsistencies of the Gospel of John.",1478908800,,2019,4.832369942196531
1997019,4,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John is a magnificent visual retelling of Jesus life from Johns eyes. John was sent before Jesus to prepare the world for the birth of the savior. John told curious people that he was not the Messiah or a prophet, but still baptized with water because that was how Gods chosen one was to be revealed. This two-and-a-half-hour story follows Christianitys Savior, Jesus Christ as he embarks on an incredible journey. Jesus begins by finding his disciples and calling them to follow him in his quest to bring light into the world. Once all twelve of his disciples have been gathered Jesus begins to prove to them that he is glorious. He performs miracles such as turning water into wine at a wedding, healing a blind man, as well as raising the dead. There is also a scene where Jesus finds merchants selling inside of a temple and becomes enraged. He turns over tables, scatters coins on the ground and releases the livestock. This act gained the attention of many, some critics, and is important to show the devoted character of Jesus. To prove to the cynics that he is the son of God, he orders them to destroy the temple and he will replace it in three days. With each miracle, he performs more people begin to place their faith in him. However, there are still some who do not like that Jesus has so much power and conspire to sentence him to death.

The truly wonderful things about this movie is how closely it portrays the Christian faith. In the first few minutes of the movie the narrator actively includes how Christians view their God and beliefs. Throughout The Gospel of John, the settings as well as the traditional clothing were close representations of what life was like in the time of Jesus. It also contains religious traditions such as Passover. In addition, there are many quotes from the bible. This movie is extremely important to the people of the faith, just as any religious movie is. It is wonderful that the directors prided themselves to make it as accurate as possible.

Jesus looks natural in this movie; his hair and robe is what I expected it to look like.  Jesus has no weird make-up or obvious wig; that I find distracting in some movies about Jesus.  Jesus' nature is seen through the actor.  ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and this movie ""The Gospel of John"", I would not want to be without.

My one year old sits enraptured whenever I put it on. We don't have TV and hardly ever watch movies so the few things we do watch really capture his attention. I feel good knowing that God's word is being hidden in his heart and the repetition is actually a good thing as I often play it while preparing dinner as a mental break and wind down time for us both. There is enough action in John's account to keep the attention of a young child from the wedding feast to the scourging in the temple to the many miraculous accounts, this production is first-class.",1463529600,,733,4.318840579710145

Many have criticized it but if you read some of the older 2007 reviews, you get the idea that they used bible
translations, some of which I have and are familiar with.  We use primarily the King James Version for church
and bible study but, for the record, you can get much out of the story line and if you have ever read the Book
of John, read it again.  You will find this film enjoyable.  The PC13 rating, of course, was for the segment of
the crucifixion.  As with the Passion, I as a  woman, did turn away, just hearing it is painful enough but
reminds us that Jesus took our punishment upon himself.  That is what he came for.  The be our Kinsman
Redeemer.  If you research the film, and you're interested, you can check out the translations to see if
you feel that they changed the original gospel.",1457913600,,925,4.294797687861272

1997074,5,B0001FT50A,"I am currently taking a World Religion class and this course has opened up my mind  about different religions and cultures all around the world. Christianity may be one of the most debated religions in history. There are many consistencies and inconsistencies with the stories about the  recorded gospels. The Gospel of John is a great story about the teachings,healing and prophecies of Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus is the light of the world and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. One of the quotes from this movie that stand out in my mind is ""The light has come into the world but people love the darkness. Those who do evil things hate the light and will not come to the light, because they do not want their evil deed shown up. Those who do what is true come to the light in order to show what they did is in obedience to God."" Jesus fought and preached to many some believed others did not. John tells stories of Jesus baptizing people and preaching the word of god prophesying to the people who came in contact with him. The believers went out and told whoever would listen about the savior Jesus. Jesus traveled and preached his prophecies to the people of Galilee,Canaan, and Judea. One example of Jesus grace there was a young boy who was about to die the child's father came to Jesus and asked him to save his son,Jesus told him your child will live by the man believing Jesus words the child lived. This was one of many miracles Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee. Jesus had many death threats and was persecuted and stoned by the non believers. Jesus walked the earth to let people know that those who believe in him will live even though they die. This movie is a great depiction of the Gospel of John and the work and teachings  of Jesus Christ.",1447545600,,1808,4.5060975609756095

Having been a Christian almost 40 years, and even having been saved out of a pit of hell, this movie just changed my life, making him seem so very much more real.  I have always been a movie watcher - not so much anymore now that I am older - but I relate to movies well.  Not all people do.  I have bought many copies of this and given them away - that is an indication of how highly I recommend it.

There is a longer 3-hour version and a shorter 2-hour version. Both have quality production and a clear presentation of the Gospel message and are highly recommended! Mr. Cusick delivers an extraordinary (tender, poignant, dignified, humble, passionate) portrayal of Christ. It is our family tradition to watch this in portions in the weeks leading up to Resurrection Sunday every year. We also used this DVD alongside of our family's inductive Bible study of the entire Gospel of John. We cannot recommend this film enough! (Sadly, the company made film versions of the Gospel of Matthew and the Book of Acts as well, however, those do not compare to the well made film that this one is.)",1418947200,,834,4.957142857142857

Someone who thinks they are saved based on church attendance alone. I don't see how someone can watch this film and walk away feeling like they have a personal relationship with Christ if in fact they do not. This is very powerful, very accurate and should cut to the heart of anyone who claims to be a Christian - and is not. Many churches in America do not actually teach the bible - so for some people very close to you - this could be the only bible they have ever read, once they've watched this film. Spend the $10 and then pray your head off. Salvation comes by hearing and hearing the word of God. This is the word of God on film. AMAZING.

This three-hour epic feature film follows it precisely, without additions to the story from other Gospels, nor omission of complex passages.

The movie is a word-for-word dialog (with a few omissions for time) of the Gospel of John in the Good News Bible, it contains many historical nuances, and it is superbly acted.

Gone is the spacy drugged Jesus portrayed by Robert Powell in Jesus of Nazareth, the frivolous Jesus portrayed by Jeremy Sisto in Jesus, the anhedonic Jesus portrayed by Max von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, or the dark and grimy Jesus portrayed by Jim Caviezel in The Passion of Christ. Henry Ian Cusicks portrayal of Jesus is eminently believable. Jesus smiles appropriately, he walks without affectation, he ponders with the normal momentary removal from the immediate and as if genuinely considering something in his mind's eye, and he rages with authentic emotion measured to the issue. Additionally, the subordinate characters are equally well portrayed, neither overly dramatic as if having ""their moment to shine"", nor stiffly as if removed from the reality of the events.

The editing of the film is near perfect, with meaningful scene transitions and camera angles. One particular scene that showed a real historical awareness on the part of the costume designers and the direction was the quick cut to the hem of Christ's garment in the scene portraying the conversation between the Samaritan woman and Jesus. Historically there was a difference of opinion and practice between the Samaritans and the Jews, and the director capitalized on his knowledge of that seemingly small detail to bring a true sense of reality to the Samaritan woman's interaction with Jesus.

If you want an enjoyable and truly superb film on the life of Christ, buy this film.",1414627200,2,1846,4.945161290322581

1997222,5,B0001FT50A,"This is a superb presentation of the Gospel of John.

I have watched it I don't know how many times, and each time, I hear something more.  It is wonderful to listen to something like this, knowing that not one word is changed from how it was written - how it is supposed to be.  I even watched the disc of the interviews with the producer and actors twice.

I had read the Gospel many times, but never saw as clearly as during this presentation, what Jesus was up against and how he so boldly confronted the powers of darkness embodied in the religious authorities of the time (where are the Elijahs of God in THIS day?). The portrayal of John the Baptist, the man born blind, Jesus' talk to his disciples in the garden, his prayer for them, his talk with Peter at the end, all stand out - superbly acted and directed.  Very moving.  It was excellent.

Sparked by a desire to re-visit older movies about our Lord,  I saw that nothing compares with this, except the first scenes of Zeffirelli's, until that weak anemic looking mystic of a Jesus character came on. The Passion, which I watched and wept through twice when it came out, just looked like a very dark horror movie.

I was so sad to read that the same crew could not continue on to produce the Gospel of Mark (and other books of the Bible) because of finances.  There are finances aplenty for many far lesser works - the Passion made millions - but hopefully, God will raise up others to produce many fine works of art that will bring glory to His great name!",1412121600,9,1520,4.358156028368795

The acting was superb, the characters were wonderfully cast and extremely believable.  And though it was the gospel of Jesus Christ from over 2000 years ago it was extremely modern in the way the story was directed and produced without losing any of the integrity of the gospel.  This movie is word for word the gospel of Jesus Christ as told by John the beloved in the Good News Bible put out by the American Bible Society.  I found this movie to be very inspiring and found this Jesus Christ  to be the most believable as to what I believe Jesus would be like.

My only problem with it was the scenes of the Passover and into the Garden of Olives with the inclusion the woman.  I understand that the director was suggesting that she portrays Mary of Magdala and that this movie is a silent nod to the feminine public demand, but why change what John wrote at this moment in the otherwise actual book?  It was very jarring and causes one to lose focus of the visual presentation of Jesus' lifestory from John's point of view.

1997325,5,B0001FT50A,"Overall review:  Devastatingly beautiful portrayal of Christ.

Director, Philip Saville, created an intelligent production where every scene is well thought out. For example, the woman at the well is believable and age appropriate to have had five husbands.  Different camera angles and conversational positions give this scene a depth normally not found in other productions.

Much thought is given to detail.  When the Twelve travel with Christ, they walk with the crowds doing kind acts such as assisting the elderly. In stark contrast to the Pharisees, Jesus wears appropriate clothing for a carpenter from Nazareth and what location he may be, such as in the temple or traveling.  He greets people with a smile and touch.

Narrator:  Christopher Plummer  - cherry on top!

Supporting cast:  Superb.  Genuine.  I was introduced to the film by viewing a YouTube clip and it was Martha's (Miriam Brown) touching conversation with Jesus that drew me into the film initially.  Subsequently, purchasing the DVD and now giving to others as the opportunity arises.

HIC's portrayal is natural and nuanced.  No overacting, theatrics, or sentimentality.  Christ is portrayed in such a way that we are able to see beyond His compassion into the heart of God. When we see His heart we see Him.  The fiery confrontations with the Pharisees, while showcasing HIC's considerable talent, bring out what Christ endured such as being told He was a liar (8:13) and had a demon (7:20).

Three attributes of Christ are clearly seen:

His Majesty - There are several scenes where His Majesty is displayed.  A holy reverence came over me at the raising of Lazarus.
His Peace -  I find myself immersed in waves of permeating peace.
His Beauty -  The resplendent beauty of Christ radiates throughout the film.

The Gospel of John is known as the Holy of Holies of the Bible.  His delivery of the High Priestly Prayer in a quiet, intimate, yet earnest and reverential manner stays within the boundaries of the sacred text.

This film drew me into His word and inspired me to know and love Jesus more deeply.  I recommend the film to everyone, but especially His sheep who hear His voice and follow Him.

  ""...but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.""

1997327,4,B0001FT50A,Very insightful treatment of the Gospel.  Helps viewers to understand the conflicts between Jesus and the common people and leaders of the time.  My only complaint is that the film-makers at times treat Mary Magdalene as if she were the 12th apostle after Judas left the last supper.  Overall it was a very well done rendition of the Gospel of John.,1397606400,,349,4.688524590163935
1997328,4,B0001FT50A,"Great film.  Although I wish the narrator had said that Jesus died on the Preparation Day of Passover, Thursday, Nisan 14, instead of ""Friday"".

Jesus died at 3PM in the morning (our afternoon) on a Thursday (Nisan 14) after having celebrated the TRUE Passover the evening before of Thursday Nisan 14.  REMEMBER:  Evening (6PM to 6AM) comes before Morning (6AM to 6PM).  The Jews did not eat the Passover that year until the evening of Friday Nisan 15 combined with the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.  The reason for this is evident.  Jesus was able to eat the Passover himself (or not himself, but with his Disciples as they did), then die on the PREPARATION DAY (Nisan 14) when the lambs (goat or sheep lambs) were slain for the Nisan 15 combined Passover/Unleavened Bread celebrated the evening after Jesus died.",1397606400,,828,4.748251748251748

1997331,4,B0001FT50A,"I watched the 3 hour theatrical version, but it was really too long, but I wanted to see the entire original.  Well acted, but perhaps too much of just the Gospel itself, without any in-depth look at John himself.  I was over half way through the film before I figured out which actor was John and which was Peter.  Never did get most of the others straight. I think more of a story of Jesus from the viewpoint of John would be better.  As a straight Gospel narrative, in modern English, it was good.  As a film, it failed in quite a few areas, and it was difficult to keep persons straight among the Disciples.  The actor who portrayed Jesus was a bit weak, didn't really do as good a job as I had expected.",1397088000,2,708,4.207407407407407
1997332,3,B0001FT50A,"Unlike most movies based on writings, religious or otherwise, The Gospel of John does not stray from the text it is based on. It follows the life and teachings of Jesus, point by point, as told in the Gospel of John.  This gospel starts in a dissimilar fashion compared with the other gospels, which start with the birth of Jesus. Instead, John begins with the creation of the world stressing that the word was with God and that the word became flesh. This seems to be in accordance to the fact that Jesus divinity is stressed throughout the gospel of John, as opposed to the other gospels which seem to lay a heavier emphasis on Jesus humanity.

The gospel of John then moves on to narrate the miracles and teachings of Jesus and his disciples. It also focuses on the friction between Jesus and the Pharisees, who are enraged by Jesus teachings and claims. From there, the gospel tells of the Jewish authorities plotting to have Jesus killed by the Roman rulers of the area. It moves into telling of the capture of Jesus , his crucifixion and  rise from the grave.

The gospel of John skips the nativity scene and the virgin birth, mentioned in the other gospels, and instead moves straight on to speak about John the Baptist and his testimony of the coming of the Messiah, Jesus. Despite, this gospel giving attention to John the Baptist and his actions, no mention is made of the baptism of Jesus, unlike the other gospels.

The oration style of Jesus also varies here from the other Gospels in that Jesus gives what amounts to speeches, whereas he speaks mainly in short parables in the other gospels. Here he focuses on his own divinity compared to speaking mainly of God and the kingdom of heaven. He also seems to challenge Judaic tradition more in this gospel than the others. In the other gospels he stresses how he came to uphold the law.

Even the miracles which Jesus performs vary in the gospel of John. Here he mainly performs healing acts and actions such as turning water into wine and multiplying the amount of bread to feed followers. In the other 3 gospels, they mention Jesus performing exorcisms, but that is missing here.  In the gospel of John, Jesus ministry among the people lasts 3 years, as opposed to the 1 year mentioned in the other gospels. Another difference is in who goes to the tomb, after the crucifixion; in John it is Mary Magdalene only, while the remaining gospels say she was accompanied by others.
There are, of course, similarities between all of the Gospels. The general theme is unchanged and they unsurprisingly claim Jesus as the Messiah, mention numerous miracles performed by him, the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, the torture and crucifixion of Jesus by the hands of the Romans and at the behest of the Jewish authorities. So while there are numerous differences, there are the obvious similarities.

This movie is relative to a well-rounded World Religions class for obvious reasons. Christianity is the worlds largest religion and many of those followers hold the gospels to be inspired by God, though written by humans. This movie gives an easy to understand Christian perspective for believers of this religion and those who do not believe. The style is perfect for those studying World Religions because it stays faithful to this particular gospel, instead of taking liberties with it in order to make a more watchable film.",1397088000,3,3377,4.741056218057921

Their reactions are always positive; the film unlocks their minds; adds meaning and depth to their quest to know God. Two superior aspects of this film are: first, the loving, smiling, compassionate depiction of Jesus Christ (admirably portrayed by Henry Ian Cusick); second, the actors' conversational, flowing use of Scripture. Reading the Gospel of John in Chapter/verse structure tends to reduce the Gospel to isolated quotes and scenes. This film gives you 'the full picture'.

1997371,5,B0001FT50A,"The gospel of John is one of the four narratives (gospels) regarding Jesus Christs ministry. John the Baptist had a ministry that was founded upon repentance, baptism in water, and preparing for the kingdom of God. It begins with John paving the way and painting a vignette for Jesuss arrival, origin, and purpose. In the prelude to his ministry, Jesus compiles a group of men whom he calls his disciples. The gospel continues to follow him throughout a variety of lands teaching and preaching to people about repentance and the kingdom of God.  He challenges those from religious leaders to the average person on a variety of religious topics. As Jesus travels from one town to the next, he stops to have meals with sinners, perform miracles, and also heal the sick. Proclaiming himself as the son of man, he was instantly an enemy and threat to the Pharisees in that time.
In those days Jesus proclaiming that he is the messiah was seen as blasphemous to the religious leaders. The Pharisees were expecting a king who had riches to arrive as a messiah and not a humble man who blended in with the people at the bottom of the ladder. They made fun of him, questioned the validity of his spiritual power and stance, and also used harsh treatment on those who followed him. Jesus was teaching something completely different from the Jewish teaching that everyone grew up on and knew.
During Jesuss ministry he stoke through a variety of parables. These parables were used as a teaching tool to help people understand salvation, morals, or things of a spiritual context. He spoke with such conviction and often sought adversity. People were reluctant to accept Jesus as the messiah and many rejected him and physically assaulted him. During that time blasphemy- one believing or representing them as God- was an extreme offense in the eyes of the people and religious leaders.
As Jesuss ministry evolves, the religious leaders begin to orchestrate a plan to kill Jesus. Jesus begins to prepare his apostles for his impending death and reassures them that he is going to be with the father and prepare a place in heaven for them and continues to teach them his ways. Jesus is betrayed by one of his disciples, handed over to the religious leaders, and then tried in court for blasphemy. He is physically assaulted, humiliated, and ultimately convicted and sentenced to crucifixion.
Jesus was crucified with two other men and died on the cross. After his death he rose and visited many of his disciples and left them with final words before he ascended to heaven.",1392508800,,2559,4.802721088435374

I have seen, probably, all the Bible movies 'out there' (tons of secular ones, too) I cannot say enough good things about this one!  If you will allow yourself to get immersed while watching it, you will understand.  I do not know if any of the people involved in the making of this movie are Christian, but I believe that this is the closest to the *real deal* as ever can get.

Amazingly true to Scripture, the acting and Actors are fantastic.  The nuances and subtleties portrayed are captivating - actually, a little startling.  I went in without expectation but found myself wondering how can this movie be great for 3 hours?!  Well, it left me speechless.  As a Christian for many years, I NEED this movie in my life as a tool and reminder of who Christ is.  Philip Saville directed a crazy blessed script - And I think Henry Ian Cusick,  (and all the original cast), pulled it off!!  I thank them from the bottom of my heart.

I pray that Mr. Saville will be able to complete, ""The Gospel of Mark"".  This project is so needed, as such a time as this... Blessings, Lisa  ......oh, I will be watching it AGAIN tonight...",1391990400,2,1213,4.420814479638009

I will have to see this several more times to self reflect. I bought this because I am tired of watching TV filled with non teaching drama that only encourages poisonous traditions to make us more distructive. I love all experiential experiences of the Divine. Dogma and preaching points of views are outside of oneself.

It is a great teaching tool-- I showed this film to my high school students after we studied this book of the Bible and it held their attention. It helped give them a picture of what it was like when Jesus ministered to the people with compassion and how He changed the course of history with his sacrifice for our sins.,1389052800,3,491,4.326086956521739
1997413,2,B0001FT50A,"The focus is on miracles, miracles, miracles. consider this If you can change your table into an elephant is it any good to the person who is getting raped right now or the child who is getting abused or the person who has CHF, or HIV+, Hep C+, or a child who is mentally challenged. If you separate the miracles from the actual teachings that bring transformation from ego state of mind to Consciousness the teachings are very basic to mid level and you can find much much higher teachings in eastern teachings of Hinduism Jnana yoga, Buddhism, Sufi teachings, Taoism. Also the focus is on being saved by remaining as ego mind that depends on someone to be saved in this case Jesus (big Daddy's son). No wonder Christian nations preach love and are responsible for the maximum number of murders. How about two nuclear bombs on 80+% civilians, Agent orange that is showing third generation  teratogenic  birth defects and on and on. This is because currently taught Christianity keeps humans in infantile id based state of mind. Same as Islam and Judaism. The real path is to transcend ego and for that miracles are worthless, in fact quite cheap, and one needs pure teachings to understand ID,Ego, Super Ego, and how to transcend ego layer of mind.
Friends we need to change the current focus of Christianity from depending on Daddy to save us to taking personal responsibility. and for that I have heard, not read it yet that teachings of Mary, Thomas and James are Great.
also the emphasis of Jesus saying trust me, trust me, trust me in this DVD is a bit much. Buddha gives the teachings by saying you don't have to trust me but apply the teachings and find out for yourself. This is the method of putting forward teachings in a scientific way. also understand and differentiate It is the theory of relativity that made Einstein and not the other way around, it is Tao te Ching when we read it we say who ever wrote these statements must be a great saint and not the other way around. Thus let us practice and bring about transformation and if it does than we can say Jesus or Buddha is great and not the other way around.
Christianity as it is needs serious help. It's time to bring forth James, Mary, Thomas are other gospels that were rejected that put responsibility on individual practitioner of Christianity and empower the person rather than the priest, church or those who go to schools to learn Christian philosophy and attain priesthood. Did St Frances go to university to gain diploma to be a priest or did he take personal responsibility of observing his thoughts, emotions, actions which brought about conscious state of mind that transcended ego layer of mind.",1388793600,,2678,4.659619450317125

During this movie I learned some things that I didn't know and some things that were very interesting because I would have never knew it was done the way they did it. This movie is about Jesus. Jesus comes in and starts to gather a nice little entourage of disciples, Jesus decides he will travel with them around Judea bringing Gods truth and racking up an impressive list of miracles. They start turning different things around like water into wine, healing blind people, raising a guy from the dead, and he does it all without even hurting himself. But everybody don't like the coming of Messiah (Jesus).The religious people in Judea then starts gossiping about it saying stuff like theres a walking man around who can raise people from the dead. They then talk about it and come up with an evil plot to have Jesus killed and then we assume they start practicing their laughs for when they decide to do it and the day come. The next time Jesus comes to Jerusalem they figure thats the day but he is arrested instead because one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, conspires with the religious authorities. He was taken to the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, and sentenced to death by crucifixion. Jesus then dies but comes back to life. He then appears to some of his disciples and even gives out good advice, and tells then to keep his story going around. They oblige and the rest of history of the western world. This movie relates to world religion because in this movie Jesus himself does things that happens in world religion like healing people when the doctors have gave up on them. Another, thing is the killing of Messiah happened something like that instead he was nailed to a cross.

It points out how Christ conquered death and how the apostle John says that if you believe in the resurrection, you will have eternal life.
This movie also shows in heart wrenching detail how the Romans of the day mistreated Jesus and how the Jewish Pharisees saw Jesus as a threat and what lengths they would go through to see him crucified.
This is a very accurate portrayal of the book of John and the life of Jesus.  However, you won't see a lot of the parables that Jesus said like in other books, but this movie stays true to the book of John, said to be written word for word from the bible.  The movie was very moving like Jesus walking on water and when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead.  It was hard not to cry watching these things.
Christ was on a mission and this was a great story that you should see with your family.  This movie relates to our World Religion class and Christianity in a big way; Jesus being the center of Christianity and how this short lived ministry turned into a major world religion.  It is amazing how people hated Christ then and hate his teachings today and his claim to be God.",1384646400,2,1490,4.315412186379929

2. The portrayal of Jesus is wonderful. In some Bible movies, Jesus is portrayed as boring, cheesy, etc. In this movie, He is so loving. He has depth.

I could watch this movie over and over and never tire of it.",1384473600,,356,4.313432835820896

Most of all, I love the Word being used without any additions.  I can use it in teaching and know that our ladies are hearing God's Word.  We remember what we hear, and His Word is perfect.

I use it at the end of teaching a lesson on the Gospel of John.  Having already studied and listened to the Bible truth, our students seem to find the video very helpful.

By the way, this is my second copy...I gave the first to another person who will also be able to learn and to help others learn more about Jesus.  To me, this is a beautiful gift to give anyone who wants to know about Him!",1382486400,4,767,4.205479452054795

This is a sort of visual commentary on the book of John.

If you are an audio or visual learner and would like to understand what the Bible says about Jesus, this is probably the best place to start! I've probably watched this movie 30-40 times and it has helped me to understand and memorize large portions of the book of John.",1382486400,3,692,4.672131147540983

True to the story of the bible from writing in the sand when a woman is accused of adultery - and that is very significant believe me, it is a delight spiritually to watch.

I really enjoyed this video a lot and it stuck true to the bible without adding lines or verses. Great for seeing the word and memorizing it while still enjoying the movie while doing so! With all movies, its the directors interpretation and I feel like the acting is almost too good and professional while it misses true intimacy that Jesus has with people through the Holy Spirit and a prophet lens to it. I would love to see a film where Jesus acts the way he truly is, passionate, out-of-the ordinary and Beautiful and this kind of lacks his uniqueness and beauty that one can only find with an actual life with Him.

1997512,4,B0001FT50A,"""The Gospel of John DVD"" is a visual Bible using the Good News Bible translation of the gospel of John and has a 3 hour runtime. The dialogue and narration are directly from gospel of John, like an audio Bible, which means that events that John didn't talk about aren't shown. The costumes, settings, and actions attempt to give a visual idea of what it all might have looked like.

There were a number of small things that I suspect are more modern Western ideas rather than what it actually would have been like in Jesus life, but I think they did the major things very nicely. The actor played Jesus as mostly solemn and serious. I found ""Jesus'"" tendency to show off his chest a bit distracting, but, hey.

In the Person of God the Son, He would stand in harm's way for us to receive the blows of God's wrath to redeem sinners.  There are so many attempts to dramatize the Bible that are SUCH a disappointment as they add their so-called poetic license to distort Scripture for theatrical effect, which have served to cheapen the majesty of Scripture.  THIS FILM STANDS ALONE, in my opinion, in its beautiful testimony and respect for the Word of God so faithfully represented in the narration and the dialogue of our Lord Jesus and the characters that surrounded Him.  Our Savior's beautiful zeal in the temple, His thoughtful discourse with Nicodemus, His tenderness with the woman of Samaria, are examples of this masterful work so carefully scripted and so credibly portrayed in every encounter.  The music scores have a majesty and mystery that appropriately paint the mood of each moment.

1997515,5,B0001FT50A,"One of the problems of creating film versions of Bible stories is the tendency of filmmakers to portray the story according to their interpretation, leaving out the parts they don't like or understand, or trying to make it more entertaining by exaggerating certain plot points, etc. That is what sets this film apart - it is the word for word depiction of the Gospel of John. Not only that but this film, IMO, was anointed by God.

I first saw this film on the big screen and it was the first time I'd experienced audience members leaving the theatre as they were being convicted of their sins! Others could not take their eyes away and were completely overwhelmed. When I walked out I told some of my friends it was like hearing a whole years worth of church sermons in 3 hours. I, of course, bought the DVD when it came out and have recommended to every Christian I know. I recently bought a second copy because the first was getting worn out from so  many plays

Recently our home church finished going through this gospel together and each time we met we would watch the scripture portrayed in this film, and then read and study the passages. I know that this film helped many understand the passages better and what it would have been like to have been there.

Sometimes I'll put this film on while I'm doing something else - because it can encourage me and fill my mind with the scriptures while I'm cleaning up or doing some task that doesn't take much thought. Buy it!",1366588800,,1476,4.4758364312267656

It also includes study tips for the Bible student. I love The Gospel of John movie; it had me in tears yearning for my Lord Jesus the entire time I watched it. It inspired me to go back to my Bible and re-read many of the things Jesus did and taught. I highly recommend it. Wow!,1366502400,4,455,3.9565217391304346
1997517,5,B0001FT50A,Very educational.  For the most part - verse by verse to your Bible.  Of course nothing completely replaces the Bible - this is a great visual ad.  Always great for Bible studies.,1365897600,,179,4.53125

1997519,4,B0001FT50A,"Henry Ian Cusick has done the impossible (miraculous?) by portraying Jesus in a genuine, believable, warm manner that no other actor has ever accomplished. The aloofness of other portrayals is gone. He's real.

Also, this is one of the only depictions that involves accurate (imo) crucifixion where the nails went through the wrists. Perhaps a non-essential detail to some, it does lend all the more credibility to the research that went into this version when all other lemming productions erroneously (imo) put the nails through the hand.

Not everything is perfect. A few beefs with the script...

Narration is always a risk. Overall, it works; it keep things moving from tension to tension without losing momentum, but then it stops where it's most needed. The scene in the garden, important as it is, feels like it will never end, destroying all the tension of the impending doom. There are also a few times when the voice-over is gratuitous. Either too much or not enough.

It's all about John's supposed POV, but we're hardly ever aware of who John is on screen. We don't see through his eyes, but hear through his narrative voice. Odd & disjointed.

The ad nauseum redundancy of ""I tell you the truth"" is tiring, but again Cusick's heartfelt portrayal saves it from driving the viewer too insane.

Also, the best way to stomp on the emotions of the moment is to flash back to scenes already viewed, and it seems every story about Jesus' crucifixion does this, and this version is no different.

Despite these shortcomings, it gets 4 stars, thanks mostly to the obvious care and consideration for the original text, both from a historical and a spiritual perspective. From script to screen the pure intention is clear.",1365465600,,1725,4.8668941979522184
1997520,5,B0001FT50A,"This is by far the best depiction of Jesus on film I have ever seen.  Henry Ian Cusick is so believable, I was completely enthralled.  The entire book of John is covered from beginning to end, word-for-word.  Every word is either narrated, or spoken by the actors.  You can follow along with a Good News Translation Bible.  I own 2 copies of this film, and continue to buy more to give away to friends.

The scenes take artistic choices in the sense that the Gospel of John does not give detailed settings (i.e. the terrain at the feeding of the 5,000). In some scenes, people who are not speaking (in the Gospel text) may appear in the background of a scene. I did not find these artistic choices objectionable. The transition between the various Gospel sections can be somewhat choppy, but that is how the Gospel of John is written. I found the movie very good overall. It had fine acting. Good sets and costumes. Good musical score. True to the text and still maintaining cinematic interest. The greatest complement that I can give is that my wife who is a very stern critic said the movie was great. We showed the movie for some church folks and I have not heard a strongly negative comment. Get this movie. It is very good!",1364774400,3,894,4.4573170731707314
1997522,5,B0001FT50A,"Mr  K. Taddei has a different translation; so he probably thought something strange was going on... But he is correct in that and the other stuff mormons teach, Mormons say that Christ and the devil are brothers, Christ isn't enough to save from certain sins, and that God was man and man can be god, they get all their wives in heaven, dark skinned people are cursed, you can be god and get your own planet and be worshiped, etc... But all of that is not scripture.

This movie is based off of the Good News Translation.. and you can see from Biblegateway which shows the good news translation version that the words are same as in the film:
[...]
You can change the translation to almost any other you want...
See Bible.cc for additional commentaries, studies, and notes of the passage that K.Taddei is referring to.
[...]
Some translations are no doubt clearer than others... Both of these sites are great information tools to see the differences between translations and to help understand certain passages.

Terrific movie, with great acting, and done in a way that pulls you into the film. I enjoyed watching and following along in my bible. And have watched many many times! A must see!

1997529,4,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John stays close to the original source material but strays from the original in the tone adopted by the director for some of the words Jesus speaks, particularly when dealing with various scribes and pharisees. Some moments do require righteous anger, such as when Jesus drives the money changers from the temple. However, when Jesus speaks with the scribes and the pharisees who challenge him for healng on the Sabbath, we can expect him to take a tone more appropriate for his title as rabbi; that is, to point out the errors in the scribes understanding of what is required in the law and to gently lead them toward the truth knowing that argument is futile and beneath him.

In order to believe that Jesus is the Son of God we must posit three things. First, that he has perfect love for mankind. ""God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son to suffer and die for our salvation."" Jesus knew from the beginning that death on the cross was his mission and he accepted his mission to the end and forgave his enemies with some of his last words on the cross.

Second, Jesus must be the most patient of men. He knows all things including the heart of man. He loved everyone in spite of what they might have done or might do in the future and he offered forgiveness to all right to the end when he said to the good thief that he would see him in paradise that very day.

Third, Jesus is completey understanding. He loves uncondtionally and has the highest regard especially for sinners such as the prodigal son. Some might argue that what is required is for the sinner to turn to Jesus for forgiveness and that the scribes and pharisees are confirmed in their sin and are unable to repent. This point of view would be a Calvinistic interpretation of the Gospel and one not warranted by the film under discussion. For God to be God, God must be love and love does not condemn but seeks endlessly to forgive. God's love is so powerful and overwhelming (see The Hound of Heaven) that it is never possible to say that salvation is impossible for anyone.

For this film to be accurate, Jesus must be completely without sin -- ""one like us in all things but sin."" To be strident in tone or impatient in action would be inappropriate for Jesus and the viewer must determine if the director properly demonstrates humility and love in all that Jesus says and does.

""It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eyes."" Jesus saw rightly with his heart. The viewer must decide if the filmmakers are true to his vision.",1362960000,,2580,4.4576271186440675

The LIGHTER colored [front] dust jacket is the 3-hr (180 min) Theatrical Version 'only' (`Special Features' is only the Trailer). The DARKER colored [front] DVD contains both the 3-hr version AND (a 2nd disc) the 2-hr version (129 min) (`Special Features' include all those you see listed on the back of the dust jacket in the photo of this version).

I think this 'Gospel of John' (most recent of the 7 except for the very good animated 'Jesus: He Lived Among Us' (2011) is the best one. It takes all the guess work out of the inflection/meaning of the words, and one's visualization of the settings; it makes the story so perfectly clear that it helped me understand the meaning of Jesus' message much better, which [depending on your perspective] is THE most important thing to ever happen on earth. All the words spoken by people in the Gospel are recreated by the Jesus character and other actors, and the non-spoken words have really excellent resonant and easy-to-understand Narration by the great actor Christopher Plummer. *There is a brief interesting article on Wikipedia that tells about the production, and has links at the bottom to the other 2 word-for-word (NIV) productions of 'The Visual Bible: Matthew' and 'The Visual Bible: Acts' which I am anxious to see.

1997564,4,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John was written two decades after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, in the time when the Romans Empire controlled Jerusalem. The Gospel of John provides viewers with a clear vision of the path that Jesus Christ took along the path that God had ordered for him.

John was sent by God as a messenger to tell the people about God and his light. John was not the light but one who had come to tell the people about the light who was Jesus. John spoke about God and the spirit that was given to him to spread about Jesus the true Messiah and Prophet. God gave the law through Moses and through Jesus Christ he gave grace and truth. God loved the people because they loved Jesus, for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son so that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life, John 3:16.

John continued to speak openly and freely to the high priest and messengers who questioned him about Jesus. John baptized on the east side of the Jordan River and there is where he first saw Jesus. The next day John saw Jesus walking and two of the disciples went with him, all of Jesus disciples had already been chosen for Jesus already knew his destiny. Jesus performed many miracles to convince the people that he was indeed telling the truth and the light. One of the first miracles was when Jesus turned water into wine. In Jerusalem Jesus was asked to perform a miracle for the Jewish authorities to see. Jesus told the men to tear down the temple and within three days he would build it up again, not knowing that Jesus was referring to himself.

Over time Jesus performed many more miracles. Jesus saved the son of a king who was on his death bed, and then he healed a man who had been paralyzed for over thirty-five years. Jesus healed the man and in an instance the man was healed and able to walk. Jesus continued to try his hardest to convince the people that he indeed was the son of God, that he was who God had written about in the scriptures. Again Jesus spoke of John who was a witness of his comings and one who believed Jesus was the son of God.

The people still did not believe that Jesus was the bread of life. They felt that Jesus' teachings were too hard to follow so they still did not believe. Jesus knew from the beginning who would stay true and follow him and the ones who would not. The Jewish authorities still searched for Jesus but it was not his hour. The night before the next Passover Jesus sat and had supper with his disciples and ate the last supper. The next day Jesus was taken to the high court's where he was beaten and condemned for his claim of being the Son of God. Jesus was later crucified with two thieves. Three days after Jesus death the tomb that he was laid to rest in was found empty. Jesus had risen from the dead. After forty days Jesus led his disciples to Mount Olive and spoke his final words to the people, and told them they would receive the power of the Holy Spirit.
Jesus spoke of John as being the disciple that would be the one who he wanted to live until he returned, and asked what is that to you. People thought that John would be the disciple that would not die but that is not what Jesus meant instead John was the one to write about what it was that Jesus did throughout his lifetime.

Overall I really enjoyed the movie; it put a lot of things into perspective for me besides just reading about the life of Jesus this movie brought the reading all the reading to life.",1354406400,,3480,4.282674772036474

1997568,3,B0001FT50A,"The gospel of John is an epic religious film that made an attempt to accurately follow the gospel according to John. The film was comprised of four major sections , one of which was the initiation of the existence of Jesus, as he goes through different ""run-ins""with various colorful characters of the bible from Nicodemus to the rebirth of Lazarus,all the while maintaining steady interaction with his disciples. Jess was known for the miracles he would create all throughout his journey; turning water into wine, feeding the multitude with two loaves of bread and five fish..etc..All of which leed to the name of Jesus Christ being held in high rregard. These miracles along with the assertion of the disciples made up the second segment of the feature. Concurrently some of the testimonies were act against Christ. Woefully this sets up the third portion of the film, the last supper and the crucifixion where we (the audience) witness the somewhat demise of Jesus Christ. After three days Christ resurrected, the final section of the film which I believe to be the most important of all because in my opinion the sight of Jesus being hung upon a cross with his lifeless body drenched in blood bearing a crown of thorns on his head, followed buy the dramatic shift (which is nothing short of a miracle ) that is life coming on to Jesus once more was the main point of Christianity. The fact that the holy ghost of Jesus Christ died for the sins of his people. Through it all the son of God had shown compassion and constantly forgave his followers.

I don't think Jesus would have walked around with his chest completely exposed as the actor does. There are several scenes where the actors tunic is completly opened to the waist. People in that part of the country, then and now, wore robes and wraps to hide the body and I don't think Jesus would have been an exibitionist as portrayed in the movie. In that respect I was disappointed in the movie.",1351382400,5,747,4.304964539007092

I have read the new testament MANY MANY times, but for the first time I got a clear picture of what actually happened.

The DVD comes with two versions, a 2 hour one and a 3 hour theatrical version. I watched the 3 hour one. I'm Catholic and I hold the Blessed Mother with particular reverence. I think any Catholic who sees the actress who played her would be sadened. I also think that the actor who played Jesus was entirely miscast. His beard and mustache were neatly trimmed and cropped, the first few buttons of his shirt were always undone and open showing off a masculine and defined chest and at times he seemed to walk and hold himself with almost a ""swagger"". He looked more like he belonged on stage with the rest of his 80's hair band than our Lord and Savior.

What really struck me as just wrong about this movie was during the scene when the actor playing Jesus disrobed to wash the feet of the disciples. The director focused more on the disrobing and the reactions of the disciples as they watched him take his clothes off, than the washing of thier feet. The camera even focused on the actress playing Mary Magdelene looking on with even a glint of ""interest"" as the robe dropped to reveal his, albeit skimply clothed, posterior. The rest of the film sort of chugs along with the same monotone narration and eventually ends leaving you with the thoughts and contemplation of tossing it in the trash.",1342915200,23,1532,4.547101449275362

It is well done, but can be rather redundant at times, especially with the translation.  ""I am telling you the truth!"" is said over and over again instead of ""Amen, I say to you.""  It got on my nerves after a while because of how many times it was said.  Also, I would suggest watching this up until the Garden of Gethsemane.  Everything up to that point is worth watching, but then it gets a rather ridiculous and play-like.  I would suggest the ""Passion of the Christ"" for the Garden through the death of Christ because it is acted better.

1997589,5,B0001FT50A,"The book of John is perhaps the most well-known book of the New Testament. It is the the only non-synoptic gospel and is written in a style very different from the other three gospels. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN is a movie version of the book that translates the words on the page unto the screen word by word.

The film is surprisingly well done. The cast is comprised of mostly ""nameless"" actors, but they do just as good a job as any ""name"" actor could ever do. Instead of the just playing characters on the screen, the cast actually seems to be playing real people. Every expression, gaze, and movement is vivid and real. The Bible truly seems to come alive upon the screen. Also, the music of the soundtrack is well done: it doesn't overshadow the action on screen, nor is it so minor that it is insignificant. Instead, it adds to the action going on, incorporating itself as an important part of the film.

Besides the acting, the I was also impressed by the props, costuming, and scenery. The movie is very accurate with the details of the era in which Jesus lived. From the clothes the actors wear, to the boats in which the disciples fish, to the way in which Jesus is crucified, many of the details appear to be historical accurate. It is the way people dressed, walked, lived, and died.

In the glory days of Hollywood, Bible movies used to be made on a routine basis. The media moguls of the day knew that the Bible was rich and ripe with material that would not only make great movies, but also appeal to a large part of the population and would not offend anyone. Then the 1960s came and everything changed. Hollywood stopped making Bible pictures. They were no longer seen as being ""content"" worthy. In the past few years, Movie Land has seemed to be testing the ground again. This resurgent interest in Bible films has been lead by small, independent companies trying to make high quality films without forsaking the messages of the Bible. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN is such a movie.",1338768000,,1983,4.502777777777778

1997592,5,B0001FT50A,"When I first heard about a film made using all of the words from the gospel according to St. John -- and only his words -- I was skeptical. Didn't think it would work. I was delighted to be proved wrong.

Henry Ian Cusick plays Jesus Christ with great warmth and charisma. In this film adaptation of the most mystical of the gospels with its strong message of Jesus' divinity, Cusick's performance somehow suggests that divinity while at the same time showing Jesus as fully human and lovable, a man who relates to others with compassion, a man who preaches, feasts, shows grief, anger, and joy, is on the one hand a man who spends time with a circle of intimate friends and on the other hand a mysterious being, misunderstood by all, who unwaveringly claims that he is the son of God. I cannot praise Cusick's portrayal enough.

Apart from his performance, the best things about this film are the haunting, evocative musical score, the detailed, fully realized world of first century Jerusalem, the narration by Christopher Plummer, and the deeply moving performances from the actors who play the disciples. The wonder, joy, and love on their faces as they realize who this man is who is gathering them together are priceless.

St. John, because of his presumed youth, is traditionally portrayed as beardless and rather feminine looking. It's a nice change to see him here played by a man who, although youthful, is decidedly masculine.

The actress who plays the Blessed Mother makes the most of her brief appearances. At the Wedding of Cana, she comes off as a delightful, gracious, sensitive woman, neither otherworldly nor vulgarized. A woman full of staunch faith in her son (and with probably excellent taste in wines!).

My only complaint is that the other female performances were rather lackluster. Martha and Mary of Bethany seem a little deadpan for women who have just lost their beloved brother. Mary Magdalene's role at the Last Supper, as portrayed here, is theologically questionable. But these are small complaints.

I am puzzled by the objection of one reviewer that this film is told from a Mormon point of view. It certainly is not. The Bible translation used is, I believe, a mainstream Protestant one and I had no idea the verse to which he objected was so controversial. I'm afraid he has misunderstood it.

Incidentally, although in general I'm not a big fan of the more informal Bible translations, I do think the more conversational tone of this one worked very well in context.

All in all, a moving and visually stunning film interpretation of my favorite gospel. I'd like to see more movies made, religious and secular, that are so true to their source material!",1336780800,5,2692,4.836956521739131
1997593,4,B0001FT50A,"I purchased this DVD after having a delightful experience viewing, Worldwide Media's, ""Matthew"", and ""Acts"". These two productions follow word for word, the NIV version of the Bible. I personally don't care for the NIV, because it waters down the true Gospel of Jesus, leaves out the blood of Jesus in certain passages, and contains errors that can mislead those who do not know the Bible well. But at least with these, you can follow in a KJV without much problem. This one, The Gospel of John, doesn't follow, word for word, any version that I'm aware of. As I began to watch it, I felt some disappointment welling up inside of me. I wrote the first version of this review prematurely. I apologize. I can follow in the KJV quite well. What impressed me were certain scenes where Jesus used divine power to remove himself from harm's way. They were depicted so well, that I had to go back and watch them over, just so that I could admire, once again, the way that those scenes were done! I am sorry if my previous review turn away anyone from this DVD. It is truly a blessing indeed. The acting, the costumes, the settings of the whole production were excellent.

1997597,4,B0001FT50A,"I've already had a few people ask me if this movie will ""ruin"", ""conflict"" or ""hurt"" Mel Gibson's movie ""The Passion"" (which will hopefully be released early next year). I even read a quote that said, ""There are other Jesus movies in preparation, but 'The Gospel of John' is the one that most Christians have been waiting for."" Folks, please forgive me for bluntly expressing my opinion but shame on any of us for thinking that way. Christians should be thrilled that there are a couple of movies portraying Jesus and his ministry coming soon to a theater near you. Just as there are four different Gospels with four different interpretations of Christ and his ministry, so can (and should) there be a multitude of distinctly different movies telling the truth about Jesus.

I have seen Mel Gibson's movie ""The Passion,"" and it is a completely different story, focus and interpretation from ""The Gospel of John,"" so why would anyone think one would hurt the other or that one would be better than another? Isn't that the beauty of telling a story and that there are many different ways to do so? Hollywood is famous for releasing movies with similar themes and storylines around the same time. Just this summer we were inundated with comic book heroes from ""X2"" and ""The Hulk,"" futuristic heroes from ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Terminator: Rise of the Machines"" and within a week of each other we were given two very different pirate movies:  ""Sinbad:  Legend of the Seven Seas"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean:  The Curse of the Black Pearl."".

At a time in our culture when Hollywood is most comfortable using Jesus' name as religious profanity in their movies, the church needs to rally behind the filmmakers who dare to give Jesus honor (and a platform) by making a movie about him. Provided they are good movies and the content is worthy of our money and patronage, let's pay each film, its director and producers the respect they deserve by supporting their movies and the ultimate ""good news"" message that will reach the world.

Plot:  This is a three-hour epic feature on the story of Jesus' life as described by His disciple John from the New Testament book of John. It is the first major theatrical picture of an entire book of the Bible adapted on a word-for-word basis and narrated by the actor Christopher Plummer. Along with the narration, Jesus (Cusick) is shown interacting with his disciples John (Bunce) and Peter (Kash) as well as Andrew, Philip, Thomas and Judas. There are several scenes where Jesus clashes with the leading Pharisee (Lintern), goes through his trial with Pilate (Russell) and meets up with Nicodemus and John the Baptist.  Many will recognize familiar characters:  Jesus' mother Mary, the sisters Martha and Mary and their brother Lazarus, Mary Magdalene and the blind and lame men Jesus healed.

Good:  I sat in awe while watching this movie because it took Scripture that I've been familiar with for most of my life and transformed the familiar into a profound and intimate look at Jesus. I came out of the screening appreciating Christ, his teachings and his radical personality on a whole new level. Cusick portrays Jesus as an intelligent, manly, charismatic soul who has a tender heart towards women (saving one from being stoned), compassion on those who are sick, lame and blind, a righteous indignation when money changers invade the temple and a bold authority that challenged the pious religious authorities of his day.  Scriptwriter John Goldsmith (""Victoria and Albert"", ""Return of the Saint"", ""Great Expectations"") unfolds the story of Jesus in an easy-to-understand language using the American Bible Society's Good News Bible translation combined with Saville's (""Metroland"", ""Hamlet"", ""Oedipus the King"") keen directorial talents. The result is an entertaining, compelling and inspirational movie about Jesus that clearly explains why Jesus and his followers were at odds with the religious leaders of his day. As Jesus makes his messianic claims before the Pharisees and Sadducees, it's like watching Shakespeare for the first time and actually understanding what the dialogue means. The impressive cast of about 75 principal actors from the Canadian and British stage and nearly 2,500 extras creates an international version of Jesus that doesn't have an ""American"" look to it but instead feels as if you're watching a documentary as it actually happened. The original score was recorded by the world-renowned Philharmonia Orchestra of London, using ancient instruments to achieve authentic sounds of the period. The music emotionally moves the film and is a perfect addition for this kind of story.",1335052800,4,4654,5.045572916666667

This film has a cinematic beauty that is on par with any Hollywood full-lenth feature films.  I was really impressed with the attention to detail and commitment by the cast and crew in creating and portraying life in Israel during this period in time.  Henry Ian Cusick portrayed Jesus as a man of action!  A man of destiny who wasn't afraid to confront those who opposed and rejected him.  I was really impressed with the way Cusick depicted Jesus, ""The Son of God"", as a man of both authority and compassion.  The film based on the Good News Translation (GNT) version of the Bible was beautifully made.  The GNT version of the Bible is one of my favorite translations and it proved to be the best translation for the making of this film.  My only regret is that it's taken me this long to finally see the movie (being that it came out back in 2003).  But, that's my fault.

Cusick comes across as authentic, passionate and convincing. This is pure Gospel brought to life that will leave you never the same!

1997607,4,B0001FT50A,"""The Gospel of John"" is a very accurate, word-for-word account of the life of Jesus from his first meeting John the Baptist until his crucifixion. Although this movie is very accurate, it is also extremely long and at times can be somewhat boring. If one is not familiar with the Book of John or anything related to the life of Jesus when he was developing such a strong following and gathering his disciples, I feel that it is very easy to get confused as the narrator only focuses on the Book of John. The movie follows Jesus through his journey and recreates the moment he meets John the Baptist and gathers his disciples. The movie also portrays Jesus' first miracle of turning water into wine and shows him curing a man's blindness. I had to watch this movie for my world religions class in college and it does tie into the chapter we are studying on Christianity by diving deeper into the life and death of Christ. I know this movie was made several years ago, so I tried to keep that in mind while watching it. I felt at times the actor who portrayed Jesus over-acted and exaggerated the part of Jesus. He almost seemed more of a magician and storyteller than the man who is supposed to be our humble Messiah. I feel also that at times the narration was a bit too much; telling a story when the events taking place on screen should have been the story. I don't think that watching this movie will turn a non-believer into a believer as it is too old-fashioned for today's audience. Overall, I guess the movie was portrayed very accurately, just a bit exaggerated.

Cusick is superb; he gives John's Jesus a warmth and humanity than can sometimes escape us when we look at the naked text of that Gospel.  There are plenty of flaws, as there are in most Bible movies, but if it's Jesus you're after, this is a fabulous film.  It does total justice to his courage, to his ability to provoke simply by being who he is, to his generous, life-changing love. I have already purchased a copy of the DVD for one friend and have lent my own to another. And the film score:  DO NOT MISS IT.  Positively ravishing!

ADDITION:  I completely agree with Kim Boykin's view that the other Visual Bible films are really poor...I only saw ""Matthew"" and it was embarrassingly bad.  Couldn't even get through it.  ""John"" is as good as that one is bad.  By the way, Kim, if you are the same Kim Boykin who wrote ""Zen for Christians,""----I love that book very much :)",1321747200,,1055,4.38659793814433

1997614,3,B0001FT50A,"I thought this was very well done on all counts except one, the physical appearance of the men who played their parts was unkempt and their hair was mostly long and very soiled looking. Jesus looked as if he had not washed his hair in months. It was very distracting and I felt a dishonor to Him. After all he wasn't a street bum, He is a King!  Even in those days they did honor cleanliness and they had access to water.  Another thing I can't figure out, it states in the bible 1 Corinthians 11:14 that it is a dishonor for men to have long hair, the Hebrews considered long hair on the head and chin to be a sign of manliness, showing different strokes for different folks,.....  but the way of God was a dishonor for men to have long locks so why does everyone insist on giving Jesus long hair?  1 Corinthians 11:14 also says it is a glory to women to have long hair. From the rear even in these days it is difficult to distinquish male from female because of the fetish of long hair on some men. Maybe next we will see Jesus painted with body tattoos just so we can justify the fetishes of human nature",1313539200,,1107,4.183098591549296
1997615,5,B0001FT50A,"This movie is an extremely faithful rendering of the Good News translation of the Gospel of John, and
there are some stellar moments. For example, the interpretation of Jesus seeing Philip under the fig tree is beautiful,
and the scene in the temple (John 5) where Jesus confronts the Pharisees & crowd is powerfully effective (Moses wrote about me!
If you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?!). The 'lead' Pharisee role is especially well done.
My favorite scene is at the end when Jesus appears to the disciples on the beach and Jesus asks
Simon Peter three times ""Simon, son of John. Do you love me?"". It brought tears to my eyes.

The movie is very, very good and worth buying (I bought it!). It will help burn the Gospel into your brain!

More wide shots and less reliance on close-in shots would have been nice. Another minor observation is that the individual disciples do not stand out as they
do in other movies such as the 6 hour epic ""Jesus of Nazareth"". However that movie is a blend of all the Gospels (though mostly Luke and Matthew) and various liberties were taken for cinematic effect. This movie, however, remains extremely faithful to the Gospel (of John) that focuses on the good news of the eternal
Christ, his divinity and his teachings.",1313193600,2,1286,4.611353711790393

1997622,4,B0001FT50A,"This is a review of the quality of film making in this dramatization of the fourth Gospel in the Christian New Testament.

The very best thing we can say about the film, as a tool for teaching the Bible, is that in the three hour unedited version, it has virtually every word from the Bible. This alone is worth three stars, because this is the first time I've seen such fidelity to the text. The second best thing is that for those scenes which are suitable to good dramatization, such as the trial scenes with Pontius Pilate, the direction is well done. Third, overall, the locations and set decorations and all other crafts which go into the look and feel of the movie are above average for an audience which is prepared to accept far less than Hollywood grade quality. The only place where they may have overplayed their hand is in the interiors for Pontius Pilate's Governor's quarters. Pilate was not a governor, he was a prefect (magistrate) and procurator (tax collector). That means it was a second rate position in a third rate posting for an Imperial diplomat. His business quarters would not have been quite so splendid.

I was tickled by the fact that the one character who stood out ammong all others is Pontius Pilate. That may have been because he was only in the most dramatic scenes, or, the actor, Steven Russell, did a decent job. He was the perfect lower middle level Roman official. Imperious, but with far, far less gravitas than Ciarn Hinds the actor who porttrayed Julius Caesar in HBO's series ""Rome"". But like his ""palace"", I suspect his wearing what appeared to be a Centurian's uniform was not appropriate to his role or posting. I beleive prefects wore togas similar to senators, but without the wide maroon stripe signifying their rank.

Some scenes were weak, but that was due to the limitations of the narrative. The fourth Gospel has lots of long speeches by Jesus. The film presented this as being spoken while Jesus was on the road. Both I and my NT professor believe those would have been delivered around a campfire or a table.

The one scene which required much imagination was the meeting between Mary Magdalene and the risen Jesus. Mary's mistaking Jesus for a Gardener is not handled very cleverly. He is partly hidden behind a bush he seems to be planting. I have seen a picture of this scene where the mistake is attributed to the way Jesus is dressed. It would have been really daring to picture this as a vision by Mary. At the very least, the director seems to have missed the sense that there was much confusion, appropriate to a dream or vision.

Overall, this is a super production for presentation as part of a Bible study for virtually any grade or age.",1305676800,2,2705,4.615384615384615

1997624,5,B0001FT50A,"FINALLY! A representation of a strong, courageous Jesus someone would actually follow! Henry Ian Cusick, FINALLY gets the Jesus of the Bible right, real & balanced, and the kind of Man/God-Man that you could imagine someone would follow or die for.

Almost every attempt that Hollywood has tried gets Jesus Christ completely wrong & unbelievable. Henry Ian Cusick, however, must have studied Jesus well, and/or been very vary carefully directed to get this portrayal right. Only someone with intense courage could stand up to the religious hypocrites of Jesus' day and gotten right in their faces, yet still showed that he could care for them as people who mattered to God. Cusak does EXACTLY this. His courage in this film is what is described in all the written Gospels, and is so different than the Dreamy, Mysticical, and the androgynous Jesus in films like ""King of Kings"", ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", or even the embarrassingly two-dimensional Jesus of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" or ""Last Temptation of Christ"". Christopher Plummer's magnificent baritone voice adds weight and Dignity. And Jeff Danna's music is mysterious, captivating, and it captures the mystery, awe and a true Middle Eastern colouring. Astonishingly well filmed.

I used to think that the only film about Jesus that even came CLOSE to the Jesus described in the Bible was ""Jesus of Nazareth"". Even so, with that film, Franco Zefferelli got it only ""half-way"" right; because Jesus still seems, at times other-worldly, and not capable of every HUMAN emotion; or of laughter! (Which is the whole point of the Gospels...Jesus, though God, was also a Man, capable of feeling joy, laughter, anger, sorrow and fear.) Zefferelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" was a breakthrough in showing honest, believable followers of Jesus Christ, and a magnificent, courageous Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. Still though, I felt even that film did not show the courage & bravery & sheer magnetism that Jesus must have had to make someone give up his or her life as a fisherman, prostitute or tax-collector. In ""The Gospel of John"", even Pilate is believable, and sees that Jesus had something about him brave enough, and honest enough to strike fear & doubt in someone who was a cynical ruler, who almost does the right thing. But in the end, believably, he tries to save his own skin.

This film is as good as it gets. Buy this, or at least rent it. I'm sure and you'll actually believe someone like Jesus existed. And you'll soon forget all the pale, blonde/blue-eyed Messiahs of Hollywood & Sunday school paintings.",1304380800,3,2572,4.9906759906759905
1997625,5,B0001FT50A,"Of Course The king James version Is The only True Holy Bible and To Everyone I Recommend Reading It, Read The New Testament First.

  If You are like Me and can Not stand to Read that much then get It on Audio. That being said Even though This movie changes The Words that are In The king James version of The Holy Bible It does Not change the Meaning as many of the modern day books and media does which even deceptively teaches People to worship the government of satan the devil and as You look around You can see many People worship the lies of satan the devil.

1997628,3,B0001FT50A,"""The Gospel of John"" is a story written about Jesus from the perspective of John in the book of John in the New Testament. This movie is a visual story about Jesus, the Messiah and his disciples. John knew from God that the Messiah was coming and John began to interact with Jesus more and more.  Jesus was a nice, humble man who traveled and preached the word of God and performed many miracles to help the people see and believe that he is the Messiah and that through him, one can become in closer relation with God. Jesus influenced positive actions such as giving and praying.  Jesus had to come to face with many non-believers and was highly criticized and he had also been threatened.
I thought that this was a great movie to watch. By making the book into a film, the story is a lot clearer to me than it was before. Another thing is that the movie made the story a lot more uplifting and moving. I really felt a lot of inspiration. One thing that I thought was interesting was how my personal view of Jesus changed. Usually when I think of Jesus, I think of him in a spiritual and non-physical form but being able to see someone acting as Jesus made me realize that Jesus was actually an ordinary human being who walked this earth the same way as we do now but with much greater intentions of course.
One thing that I notice about the movie versus what I read in the book is that the movie doesn't place any emphasis on that fact that Jesus is believed to be the flesh of God as a human being.  Yes, it is clear in the movie that Jesus is the Messiah and all that he says are the exact words from God but the movie doesn't mention anything about how and why Jesus is able to purify his followers and perform miracles. I do think that the movie was on point with all of the key facts although, I am not familiar with the readings from the Bible, therefore, I'm not sure about how accurate the movie is.",1302393600,2,1910,4.227397260273973
1997629,2,B0001FT50A,"The movie The Gospel of John is a faithful recounting of the actual biblical book. In fact, it is exhaustively so. What happens in the Gospel of Saint John happens in the film. Anyone familiar with the New Testament will already know John's gospel as portrayed here. The story begins with a narrator (who frequently fills in the gaps without action or dialog) establishing both divinity and humanity of Jesus. Not strictly chronologically, but John the Baptist declares the lamb of God is coming and has several interactions with Jesus as such (including baptizing him). After his baptism, Jesus begins to gather his disciples, continuing until he has all twelve (plus his other followers). Watching the film you see the Christian history of the temple cleansing, the performance of miracles, declarations of divinity, the persecution of Jesus, the trial and condemnation, denial by Peter, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, the appearance of the risen Saviour, and Peter's questioning and death foretold. Though this is a faithful adaptation, it sometimes comes of melodramatic. Also, for me it's hard to picture history so easily, when many actors had vaguely British accents and some were blue eyed and fair.

 I am currently a student taking a course on world religions and using the text World Religions. The section on Christianity covers the basics of Jesus' life, of which The Gospel of John details. The stories match so well as to be congruous, but that is what I would expect from the most popular religion in the modern world (demographically speaking). In what was does the movie reinforce what I have learned? The incarnation of God into flesh is covered in the introductory narration. The narration continues throughout and falls flat with toneless interjection. I can understand wanting to cover a subject faithfully, but every word? The Bible is not a very action oriented read to begin with, but an expository recitation. As in my reading, Jesus is prepared to begin his adult ministry by John the Baptist. Jesus travelled on foot for much of this ministry. The film portrays Jesus meandering along through the wilderness and civilization. I believe the actor portraying Jesus tries to appear thoughtful often. My class has emphasized Jesus speaking in parable. This is shown again and again in The Gospel of John. The text I use does not have space to go into deep detail on the problems Jesus had with the Jewish and (by extension) Roman authorities. (In fact, the film seems to make it look like it is Pilate's child that Jesus heals early on.) The film does dwell on the debates Jesus has with priests and Pharisees, as covered on the original gospel. The film does also have a ""passion"" narrative and crucifixion as described by the gospel too. Its rote repetition of the words in both the Bible and my text, nothing added or embellished. This produces an anticlimactic result.  Again, the resurrection and consequent post-death conversations (including elucidation about Peter) seem somewhat of an addendum. Also again, my text covers the minimum that is prescribed to know the Christian narrative. All in all, The Gospel of John is true to the biblical book. As a film it leaves much to be desired. I feel it a bit too faithful and lackluster. It does feel like it tried very hard though.",1302393600,,3313,4.965765765765766

There are scenes where Pharisee and Jesus clash and he goes to meet up with Nicodemus and John. There are characters in the movie such as Mary who was Jesus mother and Mary Magdalene, and the blind men that Jesus also healed during the movie. This story displays many scriptures for example, the wedding where Jesus turns the water into wine, it also goes and shows where he picks who he wants for his disciples. People soon to realize that he is the messiah after all and that they did not know he was the person they were looking for all along. Jesus performed miracles and through the help of his Father God he was able to provide for his people and complete the test of faith. This movie showed how Jesus loved all regardless of where they came from or what they may have done in their lives. This movie portrayed the pain, suffering, and sacrifices that Jesus had to go through in order to be the ""Almighty"" Messiah of God. Jesus was a healer, performed miracles, saved lives with his teachings, and John the Gospel displayed this throughout the entire movie.

This movie gave me a new insight not only on reviewing over the Bible but the scriptures and a new appreciation for Jesus alone for the struggles he went through for all human kind. This movie reflects the world of religions that Jesus and the Bible remains to live on through Christianity. Till this day all Christian faiths remain to utilize the Bible for Jesus Teachings may it be through the Old Testament or the New Testament. This movie was a very good movie that displayed the Good News Bible and I think everyone should go and watch it.",1290297600,,1979,4.593220338983051
1997648,5,B0001FT50A,"This movie was quite interesting and was a very entertaining and interesting take on Jesus' life and ministries. It's mostly a summary of Jesus, his teachings, through the eyes and perspective of John. This story being named The Gospel of John summarizes Jesus' life and presents the story of his life through the perspective of a disciple of sorts...and does show many of the most popular and well known stories such as the wedding Jesus and his disciples attended where he turns the water into wine, how he chose his disciples, his frustration with the people and the use of the temple when they were using it as a ""marketplace"" together with the story of many people in various areas discovering that he was in fact the Messiah that they had waited so long for. The narration was at first strange but helpful with many scenes that needed further interpretation. The movie also notes stories such as the crippled man waiting on his own miracle so he would be able to walk and Jesus healed him. There as a governmental official whose son was dying and Jesus was able to heal him. He was able to prove himself as the Messiah via his miracles he preformed. The story of the loaves and the fishes is one of the most famous stories of Jesus which is also noted in this film.  Through the help of God, he was able to provide, and perform miracles so that others could eat and drink without having to go without. All of these miracles were a complete test of faith. The entire movie is very emotional as Jesus is strongly trying to spread his word of love and it's a very interesting story line even for those who are not of the Christian faith. The movie is very easy to follow, and it's definitely authentic as to the teachings that are truly in the bible. The movie shows a very dramatic and attention-grabbing end to Jesus' life, via the crucifixion, and portrays the pain and suffering that he went through in order to act as the Messiah of God, and the earthly proxy to ""The Almighty"".  The resurrection is also the last impression left upon the viewer and the hope that God did in fact allow him to rise again and join him in Heaven.",1290124800,,2135,4.471794871794872

The turd in this brownie is that they discredit the authorship of John for this book at the beginning.  There is much to say about that.  Considering the church went hundreds and hundreds of years knowing it was authored by John, for them to come out and use modern critical foolishness to discredit the book at the beginning really makes me angry.

It's crazy hard to extract the content, remove the offending intro & reburn the dvd.  that is the only way I'll be able to keep this in our household.  Otherwise it is going in the trash.

More important, the dialogue is verbatim what we find in the Gospel of John.  And when you see this fantastic Gospel put into action with realistic settings, great production and acting, it becomes even more alive and inspiritional.

1997656,5,B0001FT50A,"IMO, The Gospel of John is the greatest movie ever made.  It is word for word from a modern Bible translation.  I have never seen a Bible movie where the deity of Christ came out so strongly as in The Gospel of John.  Of course no one can portray Christ accurately, but this was a good job.

The movie could be improved by

1) bringing in elements from other gospels visually.  None of the pictures are in the Bible; they are the film-makers attempt to show something like what was seen in AD first century.  Where there are parallel passages in other gospels, better attention should have been made to what the other gospels indicate would have been seen.

2) The story of the woman taken in adultery is apocryphal & should have been omitted.  (It is from John 8, but not well-supported from the ancient manuscripts).

3) The arrest of Christ:  The text indicates that those who arrested Christ were astounded when he uttered the Divine Name, ""I AM!""  ego eimi in Greek.  When Christ identified himself at his arrest, he uttered the divine name (I AM) as several other times in the Gospel of John.  The reaction indicated in the text is that the arresters fell back & fell to the ground.  The visual presentation of this was lame and inaccurate.

4) There is a misleading preceding statement injected just prior to the movie, a statement added to submit to modern Jewish objections, perhaps required to get the show into theaters.  One can just copy the disc & cut out that baloney for one's own use.

As an aside, it may be noted that the Gospel of John several times refers to Christ's opponents as ""Jews,"" which is remarkable since Christ and most of His followers were all Jews.  The modern translation chosen does not translate the Greek word literally for Jews as ""Jews.""  This is justifiable, since that Greek word must have a more specialized meaning in view of the context.

So, nothing man makes is perfect. Nonetheless, The Gospel of John is the greatest movie ever made.",1283212800,2,1983,4.592592592592593

1997662,5,B0001FT50A,"In this age of politically correctness, it is hard for anyone to express their own opinion without being bashed for it, but I do believe this is an excellent movie. As close to the truth as we will ever know until out time comes.
The movie itself, maybe not a Spielberg, but all in all a movie with a budget was done very well. The actor that played Jesus did a wonderful job, his acting, his voice along with his range of emotions from anger at the moneychangers to the love you could see in his face for his diciples.
The plot, coming from a very traditional religious background, I do see things in a different light. I don't ever remember any mention of the Jewish faith or how our religion connected to any others in our church. There were pictures of Jesus with his diciples at a huge grand carved table having a feast, but as I see it, I do think things would have been simple in that time. You grow up with a picture that has been painted by others for you and it's good to see things outside of your box for a change.
The message was pretty much the same as what I was taught, Gods love, his willingness to forgive, and to have faith even when you can see something.
I do wish it would have gone into more detail on Jesus and Mary.
I do highly recommend this movie for anyonewho has questions or wants to see things in a different light.",1278979200,,1346,4.2007722007722
1997663,4,B0001FT50A,"This movie follows the exact wording in the gospel of John and shows us a Jesus not seen in Matthew, Mark, and Luke.  Cusick (Desmond from ABC's ""Lost"") manages to capture the charisma it would have taken to make people drop whatever they were doing and follow Jesus, and to stop religious authorities in their tracks.  We see the miracles and hear the parables of Jesus, as recorded in the gospel of John, brought to life by a great actor with inflection, emotion, and delivery in ways that bring new understanding.

It would be interesting to eliminate the narrative and fill it in with action and dialog.  The narrative detracts from what the movie could be if that were done, but it must be included in order to faithfully render the original wording.  The supporting actors don't come close to Cusick's level of performance.  This also takes a little away from the production.  Overall, Cusick's performance is so riveting that it overcomes any of the movie's shortcomings and makes the movie is well worth seeing.",1277078400,,1019,4.788571428571428

1997666,5,B0001FT50A,This is the best Biblical drama I've seen yet. The Gospel of John is already my favorite book in the Bible because it describes Jesus in a more personal way than any of the others. This film does a very good job of carrying that personal intimate side of Jesus to the screen. Most films of the gospels are very dry and Jesus is depicted as austere at worst and boring at best. But this film draws you right in and creative presents the story in a realistic way. Also the characters are approachable and easy to relate to. What is most impressive is the film caries all this off meanwhile staying true to the text word for word. I give this film two thumbs up!,1274918400,,659,4.238095238095238

1997670,5,B0001FT50A,"I must say ""The Gospel of John"" brings the Bible to new life.  The acting is superb and Henry Ian Cusick does a fantastic job of portraying Jesus Christ.  The entire gospel including the Passion of Jesus is acted out so beautifully.  In my opinion, the movie is the most biblically acurate portrayal of John's gospel. Furthermore, the music in the film is beautifully orchestrated by composer Jeff Danna.  I have the CD soundtrack from the film and play it often.  The music is very original. Also the soundtrack is moving and exciting in parts and serene and peaceful in other parts of the film.  I love music and the music helps me get more out of the movie.  I have read the Gospel of John in my Bible and after watching the movie, this book of the bible makes so much more sense and is so easy to understand.  There is the 3-hour original word-for-word version and then there is the 2-hour highlight version.  In my opinion, watching the movie will move you closer to Christ. The 2 hour highlight version is great for people who don't want to sit through the full 3 hour version.  Im very much a visual person and seeing something that relates to or depicts something I have read solidifies what I have read in my mind.  The Gospel of John is my favorite book of the Bible because to me, its the easiest to understand.  However, seeing the movie ""The Gospel of John"" brings this book of the Bible to new life.  The movie is based on the American Bible Society's Good News Bible.  However, you can still follow along in any version of the Bible you might have.  The movie is narrated by Christopher Plummer and he does and excellent job.  I have been a Christian since 1993 and my walk and relationship with Jesus Christ is always moved to a higher level each time I view ""The Gospel of John"".

I was so impressed by the soundtrack alone that I bought that too! It was music that was of the time using instruments of the time - very authentic! Overall this is a great version of a story done over and over again, but this one has some character - not as graphic as ""Passion of The Christ"", which covered the last 12 hours of Christ on earth, nor as light hearted as ""Jesus"" which showed Jesus in a happy light.

Also when Jesus got arrested, Judas is supposed to kiss Jesus to show the soldiers who Jesus is but this didn't not happened here either and the place looks different too, they are in some kind of stairs instead of the olive tree garden.

Not only does this film do a decent job of incorporating the culture and atmosphere of ancient Israel, it achieves a natural depiction of Jesus' personality and character by portraying him in the way the Gospel account describes.  There are some geographical aspects of the film that are somewhat exaggerated (e.g., the Lake of Galilee appearing like the ocean front on the Oregon coast, elaborate housing structures in villages where Jesus walked).  But the message is maintained and this film does an incredible job at incorporating realistic graphics of Herod's temple in Jerusalem, the rolling hills leading down from the Mount of Olives, and structure of the wall surrounding the temple.

This film is entertaining, but can also be a great learning tool to visually relate to the Gospel of John.",1265328000,,928,5.125827814569536
1997692,5,B0001FT50A,Combine this with Passion of the Christ ending and you'll have the best movie.  This movie depicts Jesus' disciples more than Passion of the Christ and tells more of his miracles.  Passion was basically about the Crucifiction and this tells more of Jesus' life before that happened.  Very touching and very emotional movie.  If your a disciple of Jesus you will love this movie.,1265241600,,378,4.859375
1997693,5,B0001FT50A,This has become one of my favorite movies.  It follows right along with the book of John.  Great actors!,1263686400,,104,4.421052631578948
1997694,5,B0001FT50A,"This is an awesome rendition of the Gospel of John. YOu can sit with your bible in front of you and watch this movie and learn so much. I recommand this for anyone children and families, church youth groups and adults or Anyone doing a detailed study in the book of John. I really gained a visual and beautiful understanding of Jesus my Lord and Saviour. I watched with my kids and they couldn't remove their eyes from the tv. ALso a very excellent quality of film sound and acting. I pray I am able to find other gospels so well done.",1263600000,,535,4.254901960784314
1997695,5,B0001FT50A,"This is the only movie I have seen where I have read the screen play years before this movie was ever thought of being produced. Christopher Plummer brings the narrative of the Scriptures alive with his calm and captivating delivery. Plummer begins with ""In the beginning"" just as Genesis the first book of the OT begins. Henry Cusick role as Jesus was wonderfully portrayed. I found myself reading along as the movie progressed and although I do not have a copy of the Good News Bible I found my NJKV and NASB to be close enough a translation to follow along. Talk about the pages of Scripture coming alive, WOW! This movie opens a window, a window to the past, which gives the viewer a glimpse of what it must have been like when the Messiah came into the world and the privilege to have lived and believed in the Lord when He walked on earth in the flesh. In these dark and last days it is refreshing to view something as wholesome as The Gospel of John, which promises through the Word of God that eternal life with the King of Kings is free to all who will simply believe in Him. I highly recommend this movie be seen by believer and non believer alike...

The movie contains both a three hour and two hour version. The three hour version is literally a word for word adaptation whereas the two hour version has been edited for television slots. If you have the time to invest I suggest viewing the full three hour version of the entire Gospel, you won't be disappointed.

For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Hebrews 4:12",1262822400,,1709,4.4222222222222225
1997696,5,B0001FT50A,Loved the movie. I have seen alot of christian movies and this one is awesome. Word for word. You can have your bible in front of you and watch the movie and follow with everything that is being said. The acting was great. You could definaltey tell it wasn't low budget. Looking forward to buying the peter movie and paul movie. I informed a few people about the movie and they were going to buy it soon. My daughter is 9yrs old and she loved it. But then again she is a big J.C. fan. :),1262822400,,487,4.083333333333333
1997697,5,B0001FT50A,"This word-by-word Good News Version narration and dramatization of the Apostle John's gospel is a masterpiece. I have the Visual Bible's versions of Matthew and Acts and this one tops them. After watching the film, I was inspired to utilize it in my adult Sunday School class as a point of departure for discussion. (I did have trouble trying to find the source to receive approval for showing it, but was finally successful. I got the ""OK"" to use it in a Sunday School setting, but if you plan to show it to the entire congregation, you must pay for the license.) The actor portraying Jesus, Henry Ian Cusick,  does a wonderful job of presenting the Incarnate Savior. The entire cast is so believable that you feel that you are experiencing the gospel firsthand. The optional interactive helps provide a valuable tool to help you understand the geography and the customs of the day. I ordered the Ministry Version and the extras on the second disc give you insights into the production of the film. A new Visual Bible film, ""The Gospel of Mark"" is coming soon and I will be among the first to order it.",1262822400,,1103,4.598984771573604
1997698,5,B0001FT50A,"You can follow this movie through the Book of St. John in the New Testament, and see that it is a word for word representation of that book.  What a wonderful blessing to find a movie about Jesus Christ that has not been ""adpated"" to someone else's interpretation.  I have watched this movie more times than I can count, as I love to hear the Words of my Lord being spoken to me; I often turn it on at night as I climb in bed, and find comfort falling asleep to His words, with the assurance that they are true to the Bible.

Thank you for making this film true to His Word!  Very well acted and produced; very realistic; really brings the Book to life.",1261872000,,653,4.158730158730159
1997699,5,B0001FT50A,"There has always been plenty of movies about Jesus and His life here on earth. I was hoping to find this movie different
in some ways, being that it was His life according to John only. I was very pleased with it. For the first time they
depicted Jesus as looking Jewish which He was- and very believable in character. The two hour version seemed to ""skim""
over details a bit- but obviously because of time constraints. So much to say in so little time. Over all this was a
beautifully done movie, and I was very glad to have gotten it. Am planning on passing it around my family. Thanks",1261785600,,587,4.297297297297297
1997700,5,B0001FT50A,As a keen bible student I was impressed with the accuracy of the presentation. I followed the wording and emotional content as it was rendered in the Bible. The movie was both educational and very enjoyable. There appeared to be no attempt to deviate from the bible in any way. Nothing was sacrificed by adhering faithfully to the text of the bible translation used. A must see for any serious student of the bible particularly in these LAST DAYS.,1261612800,,447,4.670886075949367
1997701,5,B0001FT50A,"Many people suggest sending new Christians to read John as their first foray into the Bible. It will introduce them in the important tenets of being a follower of Jesus. This DVD is by far the most accurate and revealing portrayal of John that I have seen in a movie version. Kudos to the acting - especially of Jesus' character - it even revealed some new facets for me, and I am a longtime book of John fan. I am sending copies to my loved ones who want to know the Lord more.",1260835200,,478,4.150537634408602
1997702,5,B0001FT50A,"This was an excellent production of the book of John. The narrative went verse by verse and the dramatization was extremely well done; professional and engaging. I'd highly recommend this video, but especially to anyone who is a visual learner like my daughter.  We used it for a family devotional time once a week, watching a chapter or two at a time and discussing. Both my kids enjoyed the film very much and I was amazed at how much they retained from week to week, especially my daughter.",1260316800,,493,4.6022727272727275
1997703,5,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John has always been the hardest for me to understand of the four gospels.  I have read each of them over a dozen times but only after viewing this DVD does it all come together for me.  Watching the facial expressions and body language of the actors clarifies so many parts of the gospel.  No expra interpretations take away from the truths of the book.  My husband is a pastor and he too finds this a wonderful, factual account of Jesus as told by John.",1259539200,,469,4.295454545454546
1997704,5,B0001FT50A,"I was stunned how this film moved me.  I did not know what to expect, but I did suspect it was either 'Hollywoodized' or mediocre, as a result.  Instead, I found it to not only be true to scripture (in fact, you can sit with your Bible and follow along, word for word)--- but performed with rare a depth. The acting, setting, costumes - everything, enhanced the story in meaningful ways.  This is an excellant way to introduce those who are visually-oriented (as well as addicted to 'Hollywood' caliber drama) to the Gospel.  A final note - by all means, watch the 3-hour version.  The 2-hour one is good - but critical (in my opinion) verses are left out (i.e., when Jesus explains how the Judgement works).",1259020800,,708,4.543307086614173
1997705,3,B0001FT50A,"When I realized this was a three hour movie, I thought I was going to be losing intrest by the end. The movie was intresting enough to keep me watching with some sense of excitement. On the other hand, I would rather read the Gospel of John and see all the details and the exact words of the Lord Jesus Christ than watch a movie that paraphrases the holy words of our Savior.
Overall, this movie tracked along with the Gospel of John. It showed many of the characters intorduced in the book and gave a bisic description of the life of Jesus. The movie showed Jesus healing the sick, raising Lazarus from the grave, saving the womans life who was caught in the act of adultry and many other stories taught in the Gospel of John. The movie showed the struggles that Jesus and his disciples faced while presenting the fact that He was the Messiah that those in times past prophecied about.
I have been active in my church for my entire life. Because of that, I am very familiar with the Gospel of John. The movie, somewhat realistic, did not tell all the details associated with the story of Jesus Christ. Oner for example, What happened to John the Baptist. Another is after Judas betrays the Lord, the movie does not show him hanging himself because of the guilt he feels. One of the biggest, most important things left out was Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane praying and asking God to let this cup pass from him. This is one of the greatest parts of the story of Jesus. Christ knew no sin, yet he took the ""Cup"" which contained the sins of the whole world and drank it. Although of some of the scenarios seem minor, anytime you are duplicating the Bible and Jesus, there are no small details.",1258848000,,1694,4.398089171974522
1997706,5,B0001FT50A,"I agree with the individual who said the two-hour version is very good but the three-hour version is great, because the latter has a whole lot of the biblical narration used to place the actors in context.  Of course, it is difficult to perfectly perform a written description of history, with all of its God-breathed emotions and descriptions and significances, through the eye of a camera lens.  We are, after all, just human.  BUT this is the most loving, moving, engrossing attempt I have ever seen.  Cusick is passionate about bringing the human side of Jesus to the audience, and it pays off.  I turn on this movie (or even fall asleep to it) when I want to hang out with Jesus, as a friend.",1257120000,2,697,4.544

1997708,5,B0001FT50A,"Like the film title said, ""It's a faithful presentation of the Gospel by John.  Word by Word!!! No kidding.  It's like someone reading the entire book of John to you in a film with cast and everything in 3 hours.  This is the ministry edition.  I haven't seen the regular edition (under 2 hours), I guess much was cut to reduce it to under 2 hours.)
This is by far the best gospel film; bible based, I've ever seen.  It out did Ten Commandments (not exactly to word).  It is also far better than the other two ""visual bible"" series--Matthew and Acts.
The other 2 has problem in quality. (save it for another review).
This one, has features on the DVD when a little sign comes on, you can click on it and look at the historical background information of what that scene or the particular statement means in the historical context.
Extremely educational and very good for bible study classes.
At first, I didn't like the cast starring Jesus.  But as the film (it's not a movie, in my opinion) progresses, I grew to like him and think he did a wonderful job portraying Jesus in this gospel.
The director did a wonderful job blending the Biblical text with the different scenes and it just seems so smooth--all of the transitions.  It doesn't tell you like the other two films in the series, verse by verse.  It's a streamlined, smooth presentation of the entire gospel.
I've seen it twice already in one week.  (I rented it from Netflix first, then I decided to buy a copy for myself because it is so good.)
I think if I watch it once per month, it will help me memorize the book of John much better.
The DVD sold at Amazon is above list price ($22), then it lowered to $19.99 (sometimes).  CBD is selling at $14.99 but I bought it at Amazon because I get free shipping with Prime membership.
Buy this DVD. It's good for all ages.
It is good also for elders at home or disabled, just have the movie play continuously, it will let them listen to the word of God all day long.
Everyone who watches this film will be blessed.",1256169600,56,2019,4.371657754010696

My wife and I now have more than twenty bible based dvd's, and this was, (and is) our favorite.

Very realistic, powerful and moving.  Well acted, well cast, literal, professional and entertaining.  Riveting, never boring, (we watched the 3 hour version).

A suggestion for those new to Christianity:

We were fairly new to our faith when we first watched this film, and found it very helpful to refer to a good study Bible after watching the movie to better understand some parts of the graphically powerful message delivered by the movie.

We use the Life Application Study Bible and The Quest Study Bible.",1254787200,,688,4.829059829059829

Detailed attention is given to historical and cultural background.  Scholarly support provides credibility to its presentation.  Helpful special features.  Jesus is presented with full range of emotion as indicated in the Fourth Gospel.

The video makes some assumptions about Mary Magdalene.  Since she is not mentioned in the Fourth Gospel until the passion and resurrection narratives, the producers felt it would be important to introduce her sooner in the presentation.  This is certainly helpful.  However, they assume her presence at certain dialogues (the farewell discourse for instance).  One drawback (minor as it is) is that occasionally the narrator speaks in the place of a known character in the dialogue.  It is understandable at one point or two, but on other occasions it takes away from a participant who has been represented by an actor.",1254787200,,976,5.2387096774193544
1997711,5,B0001FT50A,The best representation of Jesus that I have seen.  The woman at the well and the raising of Lazarus were the best scenes to me.

Also appreciated that the accuracy of the words are 100% since no words but what is in the translation they chose is spoken.  Many other movies like this take editorial liberties.,1254787200,,399,4.5

While on the other hand, if you stay completely true to the scripture telling, you run the risk of a dry presentation.

That being said, this is the best adaptation of the bible to film I have seen.  My only complaint about this video is the actors seem to pause while the narrator (Christopher Plummer) reads the scripture.  It makes the film drag a bit at times, but otherwise this is a great little film to watch.  Henry Ian Cusick does a powerful job of performing Jesus in the film, and the other actors do a fine job as well.

I am not part of the ""if you don't interpret it my way you are wrong and you are going to hell"" group.  Who put them in charge of the interpretation of the bible anyhow.

It is definitely a rendition from the disciple who loved Jesus whole heartedly, the one who saw and remembered Jesus a little differently from the authors of the other gospels.",1231804800,2,526,4.5473684210526315

The dramatization brought a new perspective on these verses. I remember telling my husband that I never had a concept of seeing Christ smile, but you see human emotion in this movie. The crucifixion is not especially gory, but the piercing of Jesus' side and breaking of the theives' legs caught me a little off guard.

The verses are quoted verbatim from the Good News Bible and none are left out in the three hour version. We have not watched the shorter version, but a guide is included for both to show you the chapters.

1997747,4,B0001FT50A,"The movie begins with the claim that ""this is a faithful representation of the gospel"". I certainly found it to be a faithful representation of the teachings of Jesus the movie was good not as good as some of the other religious movies I have seen but it was still very heart felt. I did really enjoy the quality of this movie even though it didn't seem to fit the description of Christ. However having seen little to no previews about this movie I did grasp the whole concept pretty well. Jesus' character was so real and touchable he makes the viewer unable to resist wanting to know this Jesus of the Bible story. Overall, from the information I have received they did a great job of taking the Gospel of John and recreating it. In a very easy to understand format the gospel is given in power and love. The movie is rated PG-13 because of the violence of the crucifiction scene, but I don't believe there is anything in this movie that can't be viewed by all because it promotes compassion and understanding unlike what we see in the movies today. This would absolutely be the perfect movie for the whole family to see together. I feel that it is absolutely a reminder that all of us must remember the true teachings of Jesus Christ. As he resurfaced the point  in the movie that we must love one another. I hope that the message of this movie will reach everybody who watched it and change them for the good. My husband said to him this was the best film he had seen since the Ten Commandments. Most people haven't read the bible and there are some who have attempted but seem to still have very strong opinion about it.

The times I didn't read along, I found myself asking (more than once) ""The bible doesn't say that, does it?"", and sure enough, it did - and I had read John a couple of times!! The acting was more than adequate with some irritating exceptions (noted below), but overall I enjoyed the enthusiasm and fire that the actor brought to this Jesus. Mostly, I enjoyed the accuracy and the different perspective compared with reading in regards to when narration was taking place vs. Jesus speaking and to whom.

So, what's the exception? Well...where my bible would quote Jesus as saying ""I solemnly tell you"" or ""I assure you"", this movie each and every time translated all of those types of statements into ""I tell you the truth!!"" - but the actor did it in a way that sounded argumentative, annoyed and/or whiney, not in a reassuring or confident way or making a statement as fact, but rather as he was trying too hard to convince his listener. And other parts he seemed almost arrogant, condescending and smug. Assuredly, this is not the type of feeling I get in my heart when Jesus comes to me personally!

I recommend the 3 hour version as being the more complete rendering.

Over all excellent, good cinematography and excellent costumes.
I had some issues with the rendetion especially the part where Jesus is depicted as stripping off to his underwear in front of a woman and his overall demonstration of chest throughout the production . I understand the producers did this due to the number of pieces of clothing the soldiers threw lots for but they have numbered incorrectly. Their depicted Jesus should have had one more piece of clothing.

Also the movie introduction states that these events were recorded two generations after the fact which is an easily disputable stance, they are known to have been documented well within 37 years of the death of Jesus and this is sufficiently supported by much evidence.
There are some translational issues like where Jesus is depicted as lying about going to the Passover in Jerusalem, (my 9 year old noticed this one straight off) the correct translation should be that Jesus was not ""yet"" to go up to the feast.

Overall it's really good, my 9 year old has sat down and watched this and chosen to re-watch it several times from a selection of DVD's. Likewise my 13 & 15 year olds have choosen to watch it at least twice.

1997764,5,B0001FT50A,"This movie is sooooo spiritually deep it just touched my heart! You have to take off your carnal way of thinking or you'll miss the spiritual side of it. This movie made me cry three times. Christopher plummer is the absolute best actor to play the role of JESUS OUR LORD. Through the subtle expressions in his face (like when he says ""I have chosen the twelve of you yet one of you is the devil and how he looks at Judas), he captures JESUS perfectly. The way JESUS deals with the prideful pharisees and the people. This movie shows how much control Jesus had, no matter how many times they tried to take him, his time was not yet. I also love the fact that it shows Jesus was not a soft push over but yet he was serious about doing his father's will as we all should be. He expressed anger when the people disrespected his fathers house, he showed humbleness when he washed the feet of the desciples, and he showed authority when he put the pharisees in their place. Like when he tells the chief priest ""I have much to say about you"" and the way he looked at him and the fact that they do not understand that he's talking about the judgement day when he judges them because he is the judge and the pharisees reject him and in turn reject the FATHER. This movie would tip the scales if it were combined with ""THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST"" because the only thing it lacks is the severity of the suffering he went through for us. No one takes his life...he lays it down = John 10:17-18 & Mat. 26:50-53. Jesus is on point with all that he says and all his responses to the pharisees. You will see that in this movie.

This is a faithful recreation of the book of John. Every word and event is true to the Bible, which is what we need in movies that are based on Bible stories... ACCURACY!

The acting was great, as was the scenery and emotion.

The crucifixion scene wasn't as graphic as that of 'The Passion of the Christ' but it got the message across that our Lord and Savior went through agony on our behalf.
Older kids, over 8 yrs., could watch this and not be too disturbed.

I cant recommend this movie strongly enough.

If you're a 'new' Christian, this movie will help you understand why we believe as we believe.

If you're a more mature Christian, this will make for great devotional time with your family.",1209340800,3,811,4.52054794520548
1997766,1,B0001FT50A,"With all this high reviews of this DVD I had great hopes it would inspire. Instead I was sadly disappointed.  I have to believe that Jesus would have spoken with more authority, perhaps like a wise and thoughtful professor, but in this role the Jesus speaks more like a zealous college kid parroting the rhetoric of someone else.  He swaggers across the screen more like a propagandist, that needs to learn more about life.  When I saw him overturn the money changers in the temple, he acted like an out of control mad man, not like the son of God.  This is in total contrast with other depictions of Jesus such as in ""Jesus of Nazareth""  or ""the Greatest Story Ever Told"", which I feel are infinitely better depictions of Jesus.  Honestly I could not even stand to watch all of this movie, because to me, it made a mockery of Jesus.  In my mind Jesus would had to have a much greater depth of character than what we see in this movie.  This movie may be partially ok for historical reference, but the acting is terrible.",1208563200,20,1021,4.422459893048129
1997767,5,B0001FT50A,"This is a great film.  At first I thought the actor who portrayed Jesus lacked sufficient seriousness or authority, but I liked him better as the film went on.  And the second time I watched I enjoyed it even more.  This film is not 100% Gospel of John but it comes close.  So if you are too lazy to pick up the book and read you should at least watch this film, and several times.

Another reviewer wrote that Mary in the film was too old.  It is possible that she was only ca. 15 years older than He, however Jesus was likely born ca. 7 BC and so was near 40 before he was lifted up in 33 AD.  (See Luke 2:1.)  Additionally, realize that the vast majority of people in 33 AD did not live their lives like we do now, fat and sleek, living in plywood McMansions, driving in Lincoln Navigators with GPS and going to the beauty parlor every week.  These people lived off the land and their bodies showed it.

Now, on the other hand I did not appreciate the 3rd DVD included with commentary from ""scholars.""  E.g. a ""scholar"" commented that the ""idea"" of the Messiah was ""around"" for about 500 years prior to Jesus' birth.  The ""idea"" was around much longer than that; it was first documented in Genesis 3:15.  See also Deut. 18:15.  But is this not exemplary of ""modern scholarship?""  ""Scholarship"" today is nothing more than purposeful obfuscation and if any of it is to be understood at all, often it is in contradiction with the fundamentals.  However I am glad that this unbelief did not contaminate the main feature.  But throw out the commentary DVD lest your kids get hold of it and turn into atheists.",1208044800,6,1607,4.375

1997769,5,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John presents the story of Jesus as it is narrated in one book of the Bible. The actors provide the dialogue, while narration is read.  The goal of the movie was to dramatize scriptural events.  The setting of the movie is from the time of John the Baptist to the death of Jesus.  It is a time when the Roman Empire controlled Jerusalem.  John speaks of Jesus as the one who will come after him being the greater of the two of them.  The costumes, and set used in the movie were very convincing of Biblical times.

At the beginning of the movie, John is speaking when Jesus appears.  Jesus is portrayed as a calming and welcoming being.  John the Baptist tells his followers, ""there is the Lamb of God"" and Andrew and John immediately follows Jesus. When Jesus turns around and sees them he has a welcoming smile as they shyly ask him where he lives, and follows him. Philip, another disciple, also rushes from a doorway and he is greeted by Jesus' warm and welcoming smile.  One of the most moving greetings was that of Jesus and Nathaniel.  When Nathaniel asks Jesus how he knew him, he is shocked when Jesus tells him he saw him under the fig tree.  In this scene, there is a flashback of Nathaniel under the fig tree.

In another scene when Jesus is speaking to the multitude on the side of the hill he was presented with the challenge of feeding his followers.  Jesus is presented with a little boy with five loaves of bread and three fish wrapped in a cloth.  Jesus took the bread and fish, prayed over them, they multiplied and Jesus was able to feed everyone.  Throughout the movie Jesus performs many miracles such as healing the sick, calming the storm, and turning water into wine.

Watching this movie and thinking about the Bible I found very few things that would cause me to question the validity of the film.  If anything I was able to visualize the passages of the Bible as I watched the movie.  This movie brought the Bible to life.  Throughout this film you see great attention to detail, both visually and in the mission of Jesus. We see the conflict between those who accept Jesus as a loving Son of God and those who are threatened by his message and continually want to persecute him.  The Gospel of John depicts the life of Jesus from the beginning of his ministry, his dramatic confrontation with moneychangers in the temple, his teachings, his miracles, death and resurrection.  Anyone who is looking for a movie about the life of Jesus will be moved and fulfilled by this film.",1207440000,5,2518,4.49010989010989

The GOSPEL OF JOHN is so close to scripture that it is an accurate portrayal of the actual Gospel of John. Jesus says in the scripture so  many times, ""I tell you the truth...""

1997772,5,B0001FT50A,"With all due respect to K. Taddei, who feels the movie has Mormon undertones, I have to disagree with his overall review of the film.

You cannot take one speech out of a three hour film and say ""Aha! There is the proof. They are trying to brainwash us into Mormonism!"" I have watched this movie many times, it has quickly become my favorite film.  I have yet to be swayed towards Mormon beliefs and philosophies.  The quote K. Taddei references, ""God called you gods"" is not a major part of the film for me.  You cannot categorize a three-hour film based upon a 30 second sound bite.

This is a wonderful film in that it portrays Jesus as a man with emotions; anger in the temple, frustration with the authorities, sadness for the people who don't believe, and love for his Disciplies and followers.  This movie has opened up John's Gospel in a way that reading it never could.

I would, and have, recommend this movie to anyone.  You will not be dissapointed, and if you are like me, it will work in your heart.

I, too, did the Google search that Mr. Taddei reccomends and the only hits that came up were references to this movie.  NOTHING about a Mormon conspiracy!

I had a small problem with the rest of the cast, like why wasn't Peter (Daniel) playing Judas, (wouldn't have to over and under-act so much) and the supposedly intelligent Nathanael was played by an actor who looked just the opposite...my little daughter said: well, he's gotto be the laughingstock.

Whoever screenplayed the Jesus character made an excellent choice. He is not too serious, yet not silly (like another I am thinking of). Not ""macho"" looking yet not effeminate either, as many paint him. I was very impressed by the fact that the words are 100% from the Gospel of John. I cannot add anything else, it is and excellent movie!

The only regret is I hear that the company that produced it is going through some very difficult financial times and may not be able to produce The Gospel of Mark, as expected. I was SO looking forward to this.",1202860800,6,907,4.142045454545454

I was blown away by the power of the visual representation of this word-for-word presentation of this New Testament Gospel, and I have watched it about 4 times already. If you are a Christian or not, and if you are looking for perhaps a little deeper comprehension of what Jesus taught and how he did what he did here on earth, this movie is a great place to turn. The scenes of Jesus rebuking the spiritually blind in the synagogue are jaw-dropping; and leaves no doubt about the truth claims made by Jesus Christ -- when he calls those there the sons and daughters of the father of lies, and then lays claims to being God -- you can feel the hatred boil. Simply amazing. In my opinion this is simply the best film about Jesus that has ever been made.

I was shocked to see that others think the video has a Mormon slant.  I just had to investigate these claims.  After watching over and over the scene where Jesus says ""you are gods"", I came to the conclusion that this is exactly what the Bible says, and I didn't see any sneaky attempt to put in the Mormon teaching.  Obviously this movie isn't claiming to be scripture so it shouldn't be treated as such.

Ive compared the KJV and its meaning and intent to the quoted scene from the movie and do not find the deviation that was claimed in that review.

That said, we find this to be one of the best movies about the life of Christ on the market.
Obviously it is a MOVIE and NOT a study bible, so make sure that you're not doing as some and expecting for a movie to be the word of God.
Watch the movie to get a better feel of Christ in a visual aspect.
Then Get a BIBLE to study with.

My wife Laura has watched this movie probably a dozen times since we got it just a couple weeks ago. She watches it pretty much when she gets up and going for the day, then throws it in again after working all day.
It has caused her to really start digging into her bible and if for no other reason, that alone has made it worth the purchase.

The ongoing interaction with the Jewish leaders was utterly painful to watch. I remember being so excited about this film, I thought about buying it even before watching it. So glad I only rented it. Believe me, I had heard so many positive things about the film, it made finally watching it even more disappointing.  Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" and the recent ""The Nativity Story"" are so superior in production value, with the finest movie on the life of Jesus Christ remaining Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth."" I'd certainly recommend these over ""The Gospel of John.""",1196380800,16,735,4.825396825396825

Among the different gospel stories I've watched by each of Jesus' disciples, this film represents the best interpretation of the disciple John's gospel of Jesus. It surely touched my heart and made me understand Jesus' sacrifice for mankind and made me love God with all my heart, my soul and my strength. I owned this movie (with 3 discs) and each time I watch the movie over again, I'd get more revelations (wisdom and discernment in understanding more of God's Word) from God. The story telling of Christopher Plummer in this movie was the best. If you are seeking God sincerely and want to know Him more, this is the best one to watch. The actor who played Jesus was superb, very convincing. I love this movie. You may want to rewind each time Jesus talks to analyze what He is conveying. But don't miss out on the real message of the Gospel--that God came down to earth, through His Son, to save mankind from eternal destruction. Plain and simple message of God's LOVE for His creation. How can anyone not love God in return? How can anyone not see God's unconditional love for us by sacrificing His own life for us? This is what the message of this movie has conveyed to me.

On Holy Week, I would watch this movie, stop at where Jesus was arrested and was being questioned by the Roman honchos. Then play the Passion of the Christ where Jesus was beaten and crucified. Then I go back to the Gospel of John when Jesus was resurrected until the end of the movie. It gives me the feeling that I was there and makes the Holy Week more meaningful to me. It becomes a week of reflections on how God planned a bridge, a way for us to have a restored relationship with Him, through Jesus, my Savior and my Lord. Truly an Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me!",1193529600,5,1897,4.404558404558404

You felt Jesus' frustration of continuously explaining Himself and constantly having to prove Himself.  Even His own people turned agaisnt Him.  It's comforting that He says, ""They hated Me before they hated you.""

The subtle changes can be easily missed if the viewer hasn't read the bible but anyone that does study will quickly see the major faults. Keep in mind that all of the makers of this film are connected strongly to the Mormon church (LDS). If you know that Mormons are not Christian and that they believe that they will become gods, then you will see why they have changed scripture.

I'll cut to the chase and point out the most obvious scene, where Mormons try to mislead the viewer. In and around the acting of John 10: 34-38, terrible changes were made. There is not a single Christian Bible that would ever state that God said that ""you will become a god"" yet here it is to see. ALL CHRISTIAN BIBLES read something extremely close to this if not exactly this:
John 10: 34 Jesus answered them, ""Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'? 35If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came--and the Scripture cannot be broken-- 36what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? 37Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does. 38But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.""

This Mormon rendition does very nasty things. The dialog in this series of scenes plays out as follows and claims to be John 10: 34 on but is clearly as far from it as can be. IT READS EXACTLY AS FOLLOWS with the actor for Jesus saying:

 ""IT IS written in your Law that GOD SAID YOU ARE GODS! We know that what the scriptures says is true forever and GOD CALLED THOSE PEOPLE GODS - THE PEOPLE TO WHOM HIS MESSAGE WAS GIVEN. As for me, the father chose me and sent me into the world. How then can you say I blasphemed because I said that I am the son of god. Do not believe me then, if I am not doing the things my father wants me to do. But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, you should at least believe my deeds in order that you may know once and for all that the father is in me and I am in the father.""

I would not want anyone to feed money into the Mormon machine. I am not really telling people to rent this movie for fun. I am telling you where to find the most obvious abuses to the Bible that was put there for blatant, purposeful propaganda in favor of Mormon recruitment. If you must watch this film, at least read the Bible first and know what it really says. Also, be ready to catch all the other subtle changes throughout.

The actor for Jesus was a little overly happy most of the time, even smirky at times; I guess I just envisioned a more serious, compassionate Jesus.

Show me in any of the New Testament Scriptures where a woman was at the Last Supper with the 12 Apostles.  Well, there wasn't any, because it would have been mentioned if true.  As soon as I saw this, I stopped watching it. Jesus was without sin, for all you almost-Christians, and as the Son of God bringing salvation to Mankind, had no reason to marry or have a girl friend.

It was long and boring, but worst of all, Jesus walks around the whole time with this odd, vacant half-smile on his face, as if this is just a game.  If you want to see a realistic view of Jesus' experience, watch The Passion.  Gross, but true-to-life.

1997813,5,B0001FT50A,"It is so nice to finally have a modern film about the life and ministry of Jesus Christ!! What I mean by that is while I love films like ""The Nativity Story"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"", they focus on the parts of Jesus' life that almost every human being knows, has already seen, read about, heard about etc. It's like Christmas and Easter. Christians always show up for church for those two days out of the entire year and thats all they know or care about because those are the ""glamorous"" parts of Christianity. What I love about ""the Gospel of John"" is that it spends more time on the LIFE of Christ, emphasising His ministry, His teaching...really the true heart of Christianity. For those of you who want more than the Nativity Story or the Easter Story this is the film for you. The actor who plays Jesus is perfect. While I appreciate the interpretation of Jesus in films like ""Jesus of Nazareth"", I always wanted to see a Jesus that was less ""scary"". In ""The Gospel of John"" Jesus is human, accessible, inspirational, beautiful, tender, strong and one can definitely see how he was able to capture our hearts and really tick off a lot of the religious scholars of His day! The rest of the cast is quite good as well with the exception of Mary (the mother of Jesus). I think she must have known the director or something because she was seriously miscast. Fortunately she is barely in the film.

Another reason I enjoyed this film is that it includes Mary Magdalene in almost all the scenes with the disciples. I appreciate that because I believe she usually gets stuck in the whole prostitute role (which I don't believe). Here I think she gets a little more credit but still not as much as she probably deserves.

When you go back to your bible to read the book of John you will be able to better visualize everything because it's so well made.",1181779200,8,369,3.8684210526315788
1997815,3,B0001FT50A,"Unlike most Jesus films, which tend to be harmonizations of all four gospels, this movie attempts to be strictly faithful to the Fourth Gospel. And that's just what's wrong with it. John's gospel insists that faith in Jesus as the Son of God is what's necessary for salvation. Those whom he calls will believe and be saved; everybody else is damned. Unlike Mark, Matthew and Luke, in which Jesus is an apocalyptic prophet proclaiming the coming kingdom of God and the way to behave until it comes, John's Jesus is a self-aware God demanding faith in himself, and he's plenty angry at those who won't give it. Thus John has no Beatitudes, fewer miracles, no eucharist -- but plenty of long exhortations.

The movie The Gospel of John stays very close to this portrayal, and the results are quite disappointing. Cusick does what he can with the role of Jesus, but the script demands that he spend so much time scolding his fellow Jews and proclaiming his own divinity that it's hard to understand what anybody sees in this guy.

Moreover, many of the episodes we've come to expect in a Jesus movie -- episodes that tend to add drama and sympathy for the character of Jesus -- are missing from this film. Where's the nativity? The temptation in the desert? The baptism by John? The agony in the garden? They're not here -- because they're not in the gospel the film is based on. Instead, there are plenty of interminable speeches, many of which are circular and redundant.  By insisting on sticking to the text, the film winds up being very uncinematic, despite all the lavish production values. Unfortunately, you can't fire a screenwriter who's been dead for two thousand years.

By the time the Gospel of John was written, Christians were facing a growing straightforward rejection by mainstream Judaism, and the gospel reflects the bitterness and recriminations of the community for which it was written. So if you're looking for real anti-semitism in a Jesus film -- one in which Jews are truly depicted as hard-hearted dolts squandering their last chance for salvation -- forget about The Last Temptation of Christ or even The Passion of the Christ. For anti-Jewish antagonism, nothing beats The Gospel of John.",1181779200,6,2214,4.83377308707124

There may be a few inaccuracies in the film, I have not checked them out yet, but regardless it is a true masterpiece.  Highly recommended and well done for a 'religious' film.

Powerful. Awesome. Amazing. Incredible. Nothing but the Gospel according to John. Can the Spirit of God write a movie script or what?

But of course it must have taken some talent to put all the technical and artistical ingredients together. No doubt. And the director did a great job. I suppose everyone could have a different choice for who would play John or Peter, or where he would put the camera in a certain scene, or many other things like that. There are as many versions as people. But what we do have is just excellent work. I can't wait to see other books in the Bible told the same way, literally. And one entertaining activity for me is going to be in the next few days imagining how the classic directors would have done it. Imagine Antonioni? or Visconti? or even Vidor or Welles? I know, I know... what's the use of winning the world and losing your soul... Let's be thankful we at last have this great cinematic opportunity to ""see"" the Word of God. May it be for His glory.

I did not watch the shorter version. I don't see the use having the real thing (the 3-hour version). Wouldn't it be great to have Acts filmed also word-by-word? This is the one book I really would like to see filmed literally. Oh, what a great script writer the Lord is, and we didn't know it!",1178323200,9,1458,4.376383763837638
1997819,4,B0001FT50A,"This is the best movie I've seen for portraying Jesus as a truly attractive person - not just physically attractive, but as a man whose goodness and compassion and pleasant personality shine through.  Jesus of Nazareth presents an unemotional Jesus, and while the flashbacks in The Passion of the Christ show an attractive Savior, they are not the focus of the film.  This film presents a Jesus that you would not only want to know, but would believe you could know, as he is so friendly and approachable.  The big disapointment for me was in the scenes between the Last Supper and Our Lord's arrest.  Mary Magdalene is prominently featured in these scenes, with the camera focusing more on her than on any of the eleven remaining apostles.  There is no mention in the Gospel of John of Mary being there at this time, and it seemed obvious that a statement was being made by focusing so much on her presence.  It also struck me as strange that if they wanted to include women, without the support of the gospel, then why not include more women?  Why just a token?  If I were not Christian, I would wonder what this individual's relationship with Jesus was that she would be the only of his female followers to be included.  Why use those scenes to make a statement about women, or about that woman in particular?  In a film that was a word-for-word presentation of this Gospel, why throw in this unsupported visual image?",1177977600,13,1421,4.603174603174603

intellectually dishonest and quite simply

inaccurate.  Even the lowliest of Bible scholars, if honest, will realize this.

So... I asked the lady behind the counter if the movie was any good and she said it was.  I decided to try it -- I never do stuff like that (show up at the movies and just 'pick something').  I'm glad I tried it.  This movie was so beautifully done.  It was simple and it moved me so much that I actually cried.  I am not a religious fanatic.  I do not like overly preachy religious movies.  I loved this version of the Gospel of John.  It portrayed Jesus and his followers in a sincere, simple, loving way -- which is how I view Christianity.

Started out ok but at the end it seemed that the director wanted to finish this movie as soon as possible.

I think maybe this movie was made more with human reasoning than ""spiritual"" reasoning. I don't like the way Jesus was portrayed here, uncombed hair and sort of ripped old dress. I believe Jesus was poor but He had more ""presence"" when He came to this world in the flesh as being the Son of God.

John the Baptist's character looks too old for the role, bearing in mind he was only months older than Jesus.

Ok, I could let those details pass, but then, what is Mary Magdalene doing with the Apostles?...in the last supper?... She was one of Jesus' disciples but that doesn't mean she was following Jesus with the 12 Apostles.

The Gospel of John doesn't mention if Magdalene was there with the Apostles during the last supper; however, Matthew (26:20) and Mark (14:17) DOES mention that; Jesus was there with 12 Apostles *only* so I don't see the *need* to include her at that private moment. This bothered me because this can make the assuming to some people that Magdalene could have been something ""more"" to Jesus which obviously she wasn't. Anyway, to me, she wasn't there as simple as that.

Other than that, a good Jesus film if you focus on His teachings only but not the best film for me.

1997858,5,B0001FT50A,"I must agree with the person who wrote ""Reasons This Is My Favorite Jesus Movie"".

I saw The Visual Bible's ""Gospel of Matthew"" and I was sorely dissappointed. This ""Jesus"" smiled way too much and he was too touchy/feely. When he says to Peter, ""Get the behind me Satan,"" he is hugging him. It felt like more of an apology than a rebuke. Again, when he is teaching Peter about how many times he should forgive his brother they end up acting it out with Peter doing most of the teaching not Jesus. I had a difficult time taking him seriously.

Not so in the ""Gospel of John"". I must say that Henry Cusick did a marvoulous potrayal of Jesus. It was especially touching when he prayed for the diciples the night before the crucifiction. It really bought the scriptures to life for me.

Henry Ian Cusick is simply amazing and real and heartfelt as Jesus.  I've never seen a better rendition.  The main Pharisee was excellent as well.  If you didn't know this movie was a word for word portrayal of the bible you wouldn't think anything was strange about it. It simply comes off as a world class major motion picture. And then after you do know, you are so glad that they did it that way.  I do have to disagree with one point of a reviewer that it ""made no apologies"" in portraying that the Romans and the Jews put Jesus to death.  I thought it was quite clear that God the Father sent Him to the cross and Jesus accepted that role.  The Romans and the Jews were simply instruments of God and that comes across loud and clear.  I can't recommend this movie enough.  You will get a lot out of it each time you watch it and you will watch it over and over.

1997861,5,B0001FT50A,"Here's a few reasons to get this movie--
1.  Artistically, it's believable and well-done (only quibble: John the Baptist was portrayed not just rugged, but with crazy-looking eyes and came off a bit Charlie Manson-esque).  In contrast, 'The Gospel of Matthew' also by The Visual Bible, was unbelievably portrayed to the point of distraction.  I could not focus on the word for word (NIV) script since the acting  did not match the message of the words of the Gospel--for ex, in The G. of Matthew movie, Jesus wouldn't stop smiling--even when the message was sober, say pronouncement of ""you are in error,"" ""vipers,"" woes, or endtimes judgment or a showdown with religious hypocrites--He'd do a smiling, touchy feely shoulder or hand grasp, even kiss a Pharisee, then casually with a smile ( or occasionally choking back tears) quietly and quickly speak the words of rebuke.  But in 'The Gospel of John' the actions match the words.  No interjection of a suspiciously high amount of endearing gestures, child-cuddling or playfulness that would make the movie incredulous.  Nor are there obvious unbiblical, much less occult, influences or biases as there were with The Passion.  (Even though Gospel of John is marketed as being in the spirit of The Passion, it is not, it is more biblical, no hints of Catholicism or spiritism.).
2.  Substantially, this Jesus film is based on John, the one New Testament gospel book (out of the 4) that so highlights Jesus' deity, includes Jesus outright claim to be Messiah, and strongly assures the believer that salvation is secure and cannot be lost.
3.  Personal reason:  it worked for me!  I bear testimony:  When it came out in the movie theatres I was trying to get a deeper hold on John's gospel, so thought that taking in a visual and audio presentation of it might shed new light that reading did not. Sure enough, each of the 5 times I saw it before buying it a new insight came to me.  Now, I can't say whether this movie is good for evangelism, as I haven't tried it and it's very long, but it certainly is good for Christian growth, mine anyway.",1149638400,14,2093,4.745856353591161

This film would be an incredible teaching tool for a new believer (young or old), since it clearly explains (in God's own words!) the deity of Christ and His message.

1997875,5,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John is in many ways a much better film than The Passion of Christ.  It is much more nuanced, the characters are better developed. Christ is more human without detracting from His divinity.  He is more human because The Gospel of John's focus is not on the few hours surrounding His crucifixion as was Gibson's The Passion of the Christ.

The Gospel of John is not as dark as Mel Gibson's work. Not nearly as dark.  It does not need the intense violence of The Passion.  Jesus is scourged off-camera.  He is bloodied but victorious.

Henry Ian Cusick does a stunning presentation of Christ. Cusick powerfully accomplishes this by simply portraying Christ's love for people. Here us another aspect of Jesus that Gibson's film lacked.  The Gospel of Christ has ample opportunity to portray this quality in His encounters people: with the woman at the well, the woman caught in adultery, the blind man who Christ healed, but also with Cusick's appealing smile or simple gestures that reveal a caring heart.

This film follows the entire Gospel of John from the Good News Bible and could have easily stalled due to Jesus' lengthy ""farewell addresses"" but director, Philip Saville, pulls it off by ingeniously using a combination of stunning visuals, Cusick's great acting and John Goldsmith's masterful screenplay.

The Gospel of John is easily the most historically accurate portrayal of the life of Christ.  It captures life as it was lived by the average person on the streets of Palestine two thousand years ago.  Paul Saville and his team did what Gibson could not--present a believable, warm and dignified portrayal of Christ.",1140998400,12,1642,4.930909090909091

An excellent presentation of the Way in which God saves us. If you are looking for the truth contained in a visually entertaining format here you are.

While Jesus of Nazereth is an excellently acted & filmed movie, amidst Biblical truth it mixes false non-biblical doctrines. Passion of Christ aims at exciting the flesh and emphasized Catholic dogma, missing the point that God's word is living and powerful, that salvation and the complete washing away of all your sins comes by simple faith in Jesus Christ, not by man's endeavours. The Passion of Christ adds much which is not Biblical (obvious by the reading of God's Word). Gospel of John is the best Jesus Christ movie I have seen yet and far surpasses them.

No pithy parables as in Matthew or Luke.  No traveling miracle show as in Mark.  John asks you to talk one on one with Jesus.  So it is in this movie.  But the very traits of the book of John is what makes the movie version so good.  It is personal, in your face and one on one.

As far as shots, costume, acting, locations, effects  . . . . it sets a new standard.

The only gripe I had was the version they used.  But that is purely a personal choice.  Would love to see a movie use ""The Message"".  It would match the beauty seen on screen with phrases of equal grandure.",1129161600,6,711,3.8541666666666665
1997885,2,B0001FT50A,"The idea of using a literal reading of the Gospel of St. John around which to build a film of Jesus was wonderful.  However, I agree with another reviewer that the Good News (GN) translation may not have been the best textual choice.  As averse as most people may have become to such translations as the King James, the Revised Standard, or even the Douay-Rheims, these are the memorable translations that most folks quote (especially John 3:16!)--when was the last time you heard anyone quote the Good News translation?  (Having read the Psalms in the GN version was enough to make me reach quickly and gratefully for something else.)  For a more up-to-date alternative, perhaps the New International Version would have worked well, too.  (As a Protestant, I preferred the NIV, although now, as a Roman Catholic, I wish the NIV would offer the seven, missing Old Testament books.)

The depiction of Jesus, offered by Henry Ian Cusick, had merit with regard to possibly showing us at times a ""joyous"" Christ, but in short while it seemed to become excessive and turn into happy-go-luckiness.  I was distracted to the point of keeping track of the relatively few number of times when the (now annoying) smirk came off Cusick's face.  Consequently, the charaterization of Jesus became rather flat, or mono-dimensional, more like a hand-shaking, campaigning politician than a suffering servant.  In addition, Cusick's stature and physical carriage (that nonchalant gait and girlish waddle) were weak and unmasculine, I thought, lacking the single minded purposefulness of the Savior.  Across the board, The Passion's James Caivezel portrayed a more believably human (and more believably divine) Christ than did Cusick.

Diana Berriman, as the Blessed Mother, was--to be quite blunt--rather ugly, old and stupid-looking in her appearance, and aloof from her Son in her behavior, in this film.  I'm not sure how much of this was intentional, as a kind of Protestant (and almost reflexively anti-Marian) rejoinder to The Passion's powerful, moving and believable depiction of the Virgin Mary by Maia Morgenstern.  If the goal of The Gospel of John was to politely denigrate Our Lady of Angels, then it definitely succeeded.  Berriman's Blessed Mother is a painful hue and cry short, for example, of the endearing portrait that the Church Fathers extract from the Canticle of Canticles.

The oh-so politically correct, and unbiblical insertion of Mary Magdalen into the Last Supper and succeeding pre-Passion scenes does, as another reviewer obeserves, play right into Dan Brown's da Vinci Code nonsense.  The film took inordinate efforts, which I found quite bothersome, to frequently and centrally place the camera lens on Mary Magdalen where, when and how she didn't belong, serving more to solidify the nefarious fiction of Dan Brown than to advance the cause of the Gospel.  Perhaps another anti-Catholic ""hipshot""(?).  This was perhaps the most irritating element in the film for me, making me think: Are we selling the Gospel, or preaching it, here?

Admittedly, my Catholic sensitivities were on high alert while I viewed this film--as they would be for any film portraying Jesus Christ.  Having countered Protestant attacks for some time now, I realize that much of what Protestants vehemently protest stems more often from an honest misunderstanding of the Catholic Church rather than a genuine hatred of Her.  Many anti-Catholic postures subconsciously sieze the mind of the Protestant detractor, such that he is usually unaware of when, why and even if at all he has come to assume one of them.  That much--which really isn't a whole lot--I do understand; pictorially fictionalizing the Gospel I do not understand.

To reiterate, the film's basic premise--to literally follow St. John's Gospel--was excellent.  However, other choices for the scriptural text itself (-0.5 star), as well as better casting and more reverent and believable performances for Jesus and Mary (-1 star) would have, I think, done more justice to The Gospel of John.  Finally, the gratuitous pandering to political correctness and the witting, or unwitting, allegiance that this film gives to Dan Brown's absurd fiction about St. Mary Magdalen and Jesus was perhaps the last straw (-1.5 stars).

I realize, too, that The Passion and The Gospel of John are different films, but the former did seem to get most things right with respect to its casting and direction whereas the latter seems to have gotten very few things, if anything, right.

1997893,5,B0001FT50A,"I am telling you the truth-- this is probably the best biblical movie ever made. Usually, biblical movies have at least one glaring inaccuracy, or a non-biblical addition that stands out like a sore thumb (e.g., the non-biblical additions about the plot by the priests with Pilate in ""Jesus"" (1979), or the numerous bits of historic fiction related to Herod Antipas in ""Jesus of Nazareth"").

This is the biblical text. The only complaint I have is the interpretation of ""the sixth hour"" as ""about noon"" in the passion history. Cusick's performance is subdued, but lively when it needs to be-- driving the merchants from the temple, dealing with his enemies.

In this movie, you will meet Jesus. John closed his Gospel by saying, ""These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and by believing, you may have life in his name.""

I have to take a minor issue with those who knock the film due to an unusually 'happy' Jesus. While enjoying the company of his flock, Jesus was happy and thus naturally smiling.  He is the Son of Man and of God.  He knows the paradise he came from and where he is going - who wouldn't be full of joy with that kind of security?  While in the midst of the false teachers, Jesus was annoyed, angry and blunt.  Seems natural to me.

1997898,3,B0001FT50A,"Don't get me wrong, the depiction and story line was very much in line with the Gospels. The settings, costumes, mannerisms were all very realistic. However, compared to Robert Powell in ""Jesus of Nazareth"", Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus comes across as a none-spiritual public relations man. His line deliveries simply fell dead without heart of conviction as a seasoned actor could provide. He smiled constantly as if selling a product or hosting a show. I can't imagine Jesus being all smiles all the time, ""He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering"" Isaiah 53:3... not ""smiles everyone, smiles"" from Fantasy Island. I'm sure the real Jesus had joy of the Spirit that superceded the typical human response to trials, but even with compensators like being ""God in the Flesh"" he still suffered much and was a man often aquainted with grief.

Another person here reviewed writing ''The Gospel of John' is so tepid and literal that it drains all of the passion, love, and conviction from Christ's words.' I can't agree more. I simply expected so much more in the way of 'heart"", but it was not there. If you want to view the movie for the sake of biblical exposure, then it is doctrinally stable.

Two criticisms that I read about prior to purchasing, and which gave me pause at the time, turned out to be of no account whatsoever. The first, that the actor that plays Jesus smiles even when uttering criticisms, is false. The actor that plays Jesus is fantastic and presents the full range of emotions appropriate to the matter at hand. The second, that Mary Magdalene shows up on screen too much, requires qualification. It is clear that the director uses Mary as a point of contact for female viewers; as such it is appropriate and effective.

Throughout it all, the scenes are re-enacted fairly well. With all of this attention to detail, it is a shame that it can be fairly boring.

The parts are often portrayed with excitement and enthusiasm by the actors but that same excitement does not translate itself to the viewer. This is a sad fate for the ""Greatest Story Ever Told"".

It is well directed and keeps your attention as every word of the Gospel of John is either narrated or spoken by the characters. All the actors do an excellent and believable job, but the one who plays the title role of Jesus Christ is the best I have ever seen. It is difficult to play such a role because the Bible clearly teaches (as one would especially find in this Gospel) that Christ was not only man but God. Christ is portrayed as a regal figure, manly and compassionate. Unlike many other Hollywood movies, this one avoids the weirdness of making him a super-spiritual being and missing his manhood, yet also avoids making him look like the favorite-uncle comedian as portrayed in ""The Gospel of Matthew"" Visual Bible.

I appreciated the way he smiled so frequently, as if his mercy and love for the people around him -- whether friends or enemies -- shone through.  I think Jesus probably did smile quite a lot, so this made the portrayal even more personal for me.

I would have liked there to be more intensity in the trial/crucifixion/resurrecton section. It seemed a bit withheld to me, for an event of this magnitude, particularly in the crucifixion scene, where I felt that his followers and his mother would have been quite a bit more emotional than the actors and actresses played it.

I think the film will along with the free 'Jesus' film being distributed by Billy Graham are good tools in presenting the message of the Gospel.  My middle son who has dyslexia and finds it hard to read his bible without help especially likes it.

Since it is an almost direct word for word presentation of the Gospel of John it does suffer somewhat in entertainment value but the original source was written to inform not entertain.

It is definitely a more graceful telling of the Gospel than 'The Passion of the Christ', and is probably a better medium for reaching unbelievers.

The only quibble I have with the presentation is that Mary Magdelene seems to appear everywhere.  She is in the upper room, she is at Gethsemane, places where it is not mentioned she actually was.  It is as if she is the 13th disciple.  It is almost as if they are trying to play to the Davinchi Code mania.",1117065600,8,1038,4.426315789473684

1997907,5,B0001FT50A,"What a wonderful movie made about Jesus. This is an extremely powerful and riveting film. It is a word-for-word adaptation of the 21 chapters of the Gospel According to John. Christopher Plummer narrates parts of the film. Henry Ian Cusick is the most realistic Jesus I have seen portrayed on film. My other favorite Jesus performance is by Robert Powell in ""Jesus of Nazareth"" - a mini-series that first appeared on TV in 1977 and is 382 minutes long. That is also an excellent movie and worth buying on DVD.

The directing, acting and musical score are done extremely well. This is an inspirational movie with a positive message and I highly recommend it to everyone.

I recently bought the 2-disc DVD set of ""The Gospel of John"". My only complaint about this new 2-disc DVD set is that they got rid of the 3-disc DVD set and replaced it with the 2-disc set. So far, the only difference between the two sets that I can see are that this new 2-disc set dropped the DTS audio track but kept the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Also, this new 2-disc set includes a new 2-hour version of the film plus the original 3-hour theatrical version. I have no idea why someone would want to only watch a cut up version of a ""word-for-word"" movie version of ""The Gospel of John"".  I'm assuming that because they included this chopped up version of the film, they dropped the DTS audio track to make room for this other version of the film. I tried to buy the 3-disc set version of this film but I waited too long. I cannot find it (brand new) even on the film's website. But I'm still glad I bought this 2-disc set - It's a lot less expensive than the 3-disc set was. I haven't finished watching everything on it yet so I hope it has all the extras that the original 3-disc set had. It seems to have most of the extras except the DTS soundtrack.

This movie is HIGHLY recommended for anybody and everybody but especially those who prefer to SEE and HEAR the Gospel of John in a ""visual"" way in addition to reading and studying the Bible. It's a treasure to keep forever. I think the Gospel of Mark is coming soon to theaters made by the same people that did this movie.  I hope they do as good of a job with that movie as they did with this one.  My rating: A+",1114387200,11,2251,4.334916864608076

It is well worth taking the time to watch this DVD. We did it in 3 sessions, and it was worth taking the breaks, so that we could absorb it as best we could.

This is the best film of Jesus' life I have seen. I haven't watched many, though, and have not even seen Mel Gibson's recent film. Another Jesus film I recommend is the excellent Miracle Maker, which was created using puppets and some animation.

It covers my favorite Gospel, and does so absolutely stunningly.  Others on this page have had great comments to this end, and I concur wholeheartedly.  My primary focus for the remainder of this review will be on removing confusion from the minds of other shoppers who have seen the Visual Bible project's ""Gospel of John,"" have had trouble acquiring it, and wonder if this is the same production, and would like to know before they plunk down the cash.

The quick answer is ""Yes,"" this is the same movie.  It was $50, now it's half-priced.  Buy it Now!  Although I cannot tell from the technical details if it includes the exact same material as the original 3-disc set (I imagine the menus & end credits will be revised), if it holds to the word-for-word mission of the Visual Bible project, then it is the same 3-hour feature presentation.

You may have seen this movie on shelves in mid to late 2004.  You may have wondered what this movie was like, 3 disc set about Jesus for $50, you never know what you're getting into with these....(Take the popular ""Jesus of Nazareth.""  Could they have made Jesus look any more miserable and self-centered in his own bitterness?  Well, that didn't happen in this movie, probably the most realistic caricature I have seen of Jesus since ""Jesus (2000)"" and the video to Michael W. Smith's ""Secret Ambition (1990).""  Ok, I said I was going to focus on confusion for shoppers, let's continue)....Maybe you watched the movie, fell in love, ran to buy a copy, only to find it had been yanked from the shelves, sent to ""The Movie Graveyard;"" and even the sales associates who shared this information were puzzled, ""That normally only happens to Disney Movies.""

After hours of searching on the internet, the truth unfolded; for various rea$on$, the Visual Bible project ran low on re$ource$, and DI$NE (yes, DI$NE-who owns Buena Vista distribution), threw their hat in--presumably in a bid to improve relations with the conservative customer contingency.  They apparently plan to continue the Visual Bible project's mission of bringing the entire Bible to film, from what I've read.  The Visual Bible, already begun with the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of John, and Acts of the Apostles, now has a good prospect for completion.

What does all this mean for consumers?  Well, to recap:

1) You now can buy these for half the price previously offered.

2) Disney may rediscover their own strong conservative roots.

3) There is a good prospect of the monumental project being completely finished at a high standard of quality.

4) Disney's marketing experience and market presence will mean more people than ever before can experience the Good News (""Godspell"" and later ""Gospel"") the Jewish Apostle John shares with readers of all nations; what we call today the ""Gospel of John.""",1110240000,13,3024,4.8671875
1997915,2,B0001FT50A,"If one were to take the 'Gospel of John' as a truthful depiction of the life of Christ, one would have to conclude that Jesus never stopped moving or talking long enough to let anyone else get a word in edgewise. Also, he apparently smiled. A lot.

That's the gist of the three-hour cinematic mess that totes itself as a contrast to Mel Gibson's 'The Passion.' Unfortunately, the movie succeeds in this respect-- where 'The Passion' was gratuitously violent but embarrassingly entertaining, 'The Gospel of John' is so tepid and literal that it drains all of the passion, love, and conviction from Christ's words. The movie's blandness brings to mind that often-quoted passage from another one of John's great works -- that the worst punishment is not reserved for those who are hot or cold, but for those who are neither. Those who are lukewarm get spewed out of God's mouth.

The movie suffers from a number of flaws, the first and foremost being the director's conviction that a written work can be translated word-for-word for the screen. The idea to narrate nearly every passage of John's Gospel is by far the most hubristic directorial move I've seen in years, and the result is that 'Gospel' ends up being a book on tape with visual accompaniment. There's no need for acting because the script doesn't allow it. Apparently we as viewers are incapable of inferring anything from subtext, so we need an omnipresent narrator to tell us that ""Jesus sat down"" or ""Thomas said"" or ""the crowd grew angry."" It's enough to please any bible-thumping fundamentalist who doesn't like his Jesus book tampered with by artsy heathen Hollywood types, but for those of us who want to see an actual movie? Well, it sucks. It feels like a grade-school play.

Also problematic is the misunderstanding of the material. While John's Gospel gives us some fabulous insights into Jesus, not to mention some of the most memorable moments of the New Testament, it is not intended to be read as a narrative of the life of Jesus. This book was written as an addendum to the synoptic Gospels, and it also serves as a deeply felt philosophical treatise on belief and non-belief, light and dark, truth and falsehood. While a great director could make a masterpiece of this sketchy, essayistic account, Philip Saville flounders with the material, and what we get is a grinning Jesus who delivers long-winded, controversial monologues that no one cares to interrupt. People get angry, sure -- but they typically wait until Jesus is finished before objecting. In the meantime, they sort of moan and groan together and make faces, and the product is so poorly acted and directed it borders on pantomime.

Because this disc set is so ridiculously overpriced, I recommend that people check this out of the library before deciding to buy it. If you're expecting something as inspired and character-driven as 'Jesus of Nazareth,' look elsewhere.",1109116800,16,2911,4.898580121703854
1997916,5,B0001FT50A,"No... this movie is not made for entertainment... but it is spellbinding to almost everyone who watches it.

I saw the Passion 3 times  and found it to be a gut wrenching emotional portrayal of the suffereing of Christ possibly the best made ever.  In contrast, the movie The gospel of John balances the Passion,  with a similar portrayal of Christ with less artistic licence sets the person and teaching of Christ in perspective  and this movie is possibly the best portrayal of a gospel ever made.  Highly artistic and dramatic.

Not as visually graphic in terms of violence as the Passion  and PG13 more suitable for a wide range of viewers  but just as the apostle John had few words to say as he watched his friend die on the cross for 6 hours,  the gospel of John leaves much of the suffereing to speak for themselves.

This is the third of the visual Bible movies.  Matthew and Acts are both excellent,  but this sets yet a yet higher standard for artistry and acting.  Every actor in the crowd was terrific!

This movie was highly successful in faithfully portraying the gospel of John,  the most theologically pointed gospel  and from an apostle who, as all the apostles were, as  the book of Revelation claims names we nice Jewish boys whose names are written in the foundations of the City of the New Jerusalem to come down from heaven someday who told thier storied about Jesus being faithful unto death.  This movie is no exception,  it was a faithful portrayal of John's gospel.

I have watched this movie 8 times with a variety of gorups  and found both children teens and adults spellbound.  I think it's the kind of thinkg you would want to watch in  2 or more sections.  Children like it 15 min at a time...  teens  watched it in 45 min sititngs... adults watched it in two halfs.  This movie is made with two parts... the first is up to the ressurection of Lazarus and the second  is more simmilar to The Passion and ends at the end of the book of John

In my opinion... EVERY CHURCH ... should get a copy  and I bleieve there is a Theatrical version out for easter 2005 coming which may have both the  3 hours movie and a 2 hour theatrical verion made by the same group.",1108944000,14,2190,4.424623115577889
1997917,2,B0001FT50A,"In all the furor over ""The Passion of the Christ,"" almost no one seemed to notice ""The Gospel of John,"" a film that slipped in and out of theaters without causing the slightest stir almost six months prior to the release of Gibson's controversial opus.  Using the Good News Bible as its source, this three-hour film is a near word-for-word adaptation of the book believed by many scholars to be the most theologically advanced and least historically reliable of the four canonical gospels.

Although the idea of providing so doggedly literal a translation might have seemed like a good one on paper, the fact is that the concept fails for one very obvious reason - which is that the narrator (in this case Christopher Plummer) becomes utterly superfluous as a storytelling device.  Since film is largely a visual medium, the narrator keeps telling us things we can clearly see with our own eyes.  If Jesus is shown looking at his disciples, the narrator informs us that ""Jesus looked at his disciples""; if the crowd finds a grassy hill on which to sit down, the ubiquitous voice intones ""the hill was covered with grass and the crowd sat down.""  And this sort of pointless iteration of the obvious goes on throughout the duration of the film.  The result is that it not only draws the story out to an unconscionable length, but we actually find ourselves snickering at wholly inappropriate moments.  My own personal favorite comes when we see Jesus rising from a crouching position while the narrator enlightens us with the information that ""Jesus straightened up.""  Another problem with this approach is that the very words of Jesus, being entirely unedited, come out as turgid monologues.  Somehow, all these speeches don't seem quite so longwinded when you`re reading them.  (It should be noted that the ENTIRE text has not actually been reproduced in the screenplay, for we are at least spared most of the ""he said""- type fillers in the dialogue scenes).

Henry Ian Cusick does what he can with the role of Christ, but since John's account provides us with the least ""human"" Jesus of the four, the actor has a difficult time bringing the Savior to life as a flesh-and-blood human being.  Many of the other actors - particularly Steven Russell as Pilate and a large number of the crowd-scene extras - turn in surprisingly amateurish performances.

It would be interesting to see filmmakers take this same literalist approach with Matthew, Mark and Luke, if only to observe how they would deal with the discrepancies between John's account and the other three.  For instance, John sets the cleansing of the temple early on in Jesus' ministry instead of at the start of Passion Week as the Synoptic writers do.  Moreover, Matthew shows Mary Magdalene on Easter morning learning of Jesus' resurrection from an angel in the empty tomb, while John has her find out from Jesus himself.  The poor servant of the high priest who falls victim to Peter's sword, doesn't even get his ear reattached here, as he does in ""The Passion.""  The film also cheats a bit by showing Jesus being baptized, even though, in John's account, the event is neither mentioned nor recorded.

The movie has been handsomely shot on location, and there are a few effective moments along the way, but the literal-minded rigidity of the exercise ends up draining all the life and passion out of the story (particularly in contrast to Gibson`s work).  The crucifixion here is so utterly mundane and undramatic that it`s hard not to be bored during the event (where are Matthew`s darkness, earthquake and resurrected bodies when you need them?)

Like a cinematic version of Books on Tape, ""The Gospel of John"" might be appropriate for use as a Sunday school primer, but it has very little to offer in the way of either inspiration or entertainment.",1106438400,15,3814,4.8474576271186445
1997918,5,B0001FT50A,"I really love this DVD! The Gospel of John features an outstanding cast, most notably Henry Ian Cusick, an actor in his 30's who brings out the human side of Jesus but does it in such a reverent yet dynamic fashion. Here is a strong rather than wimpy Jesus. Here is a Jesus who is serious but who also laughs and shows his anger. This human portrayal of Christ does not detract from the divine side of Christ; rather it enhances it. The Bible speaks of Jesus Christ, both as the Son of God and the Son of Man - the Word who became flesh. Cusick makes the words of Christ come alive through his dynamic portrayal.

Cusick's acting is just as outstanding as Robert Powell (Jesus of Nazareth) and James Caviezel (The Passion of the Christ).

Another outstanding actor is Daniel Kash, who plays Simon Peter with a lot of feeling and passion.  He brings out the different sides of Peter.

The only actors I felt were miscast were: the actress who played the Samaritan woman (she portrayed the Samaritan woman like a homeless person with a slight mental problem); the actress who played Mary the mother of Jesus (she looks more advanced in age than Mary seems to be).

Even though this film is taken word-for-word from the Good News Bible, the actors speaking make the words flow dramatically so that it does not sound like people just reading a script in a play, they make it into a real feature-length movie. I also enjoyed Christopher Plummer's outstanding narration -- Plummer is a perfect choice as a narrator since he is so accomplished an actor both in film and in the theatre. His eloquent narration holds the whole narratives together and guides the viewer smoothly along the verses and chapters of the Gospel without distraction.

This movie helped to give me a better appreciation of Jesus' work and teachings. It brought out the whole theme of the Gospel of John: Jesus truly is the Son of God; through believing in Him we may receive eternal life!

I enjoyed the special features on the 3rd disc.  It offered interviews of Henry Ian Cusick and Christopher Plummer and also gave us a glimpse of how the movie was made.

If you want a movie that does full justice in portraying Jesus according to what the Bible says, look no further.  This movie is excellent and gets better through repeated viewings.  I hope you will be blessed as much as I was through watching it!",1106006400,14,2373,4.57311320754717
1997919,5,B0001FT50A,"After watching the DVD and reading some of the reviews on this movie I have to wonder. Why do some people tear a movie apart while others love it?

Simply put, there is a division and that is what Christ said there would be in this world, a division between believers and non-believers. I'm not saying that the people that didn't like this film are non-belevers, I saying just as we have different opinions on this movie so does the world with Christ. I thought this movie was excellent, far above the recent Mell Gibson film ""The Passion"" on the same subject.

Most people think they can be saved anytime they want to but in this movie you hear Jesus say ""work when you have the light"" meaning the spirit but a man cannot come to me unless my father drawls him"" just think about this and this is what the sinner man needs to hear because many are being miss-lead by other movies, preachers, teachers all over this world ""the blind shall lead the blind and they all shall fall in the ditch"". If you want to know the truth about Christ read the ""King James Version"" not the International or another version of the bible that has been altered for easy reading. Read Matthew through Revelation and then read it again and again absorbing the scriptures and most of all pray whenever you get the chance from the depths of your soul (heart)-cry out and he will hear you. You must be very sincere though!

This movie I believe is the most-true to the Bible film that has been made thus far. If you can't read or just don't want to read the Bible then I would advise anyone that is not saved to watch this movie and keep on watching it over and over and praying with all you have.

If an unbeliever sees this film and is led to read the actual word of God, I am all for it, even if there are mistakes made in accuracy!! One does not need to fully understand EVERYTHING about our Lord to be saved from wrath, only that Christ is the Son of God, that he made the acceptable and final sacfrifice of himself on the cross for his/her sins, that he was buried, and that he rose from the dead on the third day! Growth and understanding will surely come as God nutures HIS relationship with the sinner according to HIS GRACE. These movies in my opinion are more for the unbeliever.

1997922,4,B0001FT50A,"Let me say first that I don't think ""Jesus films"" are a good idea at all; you'll find out why shortly. But because this one is better than most, let us proceed...

Mostly because of the music featured on the Web site's original previews, I've seen THE GOSPEL OF JOHN -- both the movie (in theatres) and the DVD. Also, I'm very familiar with the recordings published by Esther Lamandier that were cited in the movie. I was pleased with the richness and diversity of Jeff Danna's film score, and thus bought the soundtrack (reviewed elsewhere).

First, the positive qualities of the film: Henry van Cusick brings an energy and =joie de vivre= to his role that one doesn't often see in portrayals of Jesus. (He actually makes us believe that someone as skinny as I used to be could drive out the money-changers and their cattle from the Temple.) The other parts seem well-cast too; the chief Pharisee in the Sanhedrin (who carries so much of the film's villany) very nearly steals the show through his =gravitas=. Much attention to physical detail exists in the film, which (if you know what you're looking at) can be very educational. And by purely human standards, the film is very emotive and uplifting.

Unfortunately, for me the negative qualities of the film are far more numerous. First, and most severely, portrayals of Jesus in art are clear violations of the Second Commandment -- something even the Catholic Church as late as Tertullian's time understood. Second, the portrayal we are offered is the same old skinny, long-haired, dirt-poor icon that was compiled centuries after the New Testament was written -- an icon which has nothing to do with the Bible or history (and which does not limit its errors to mere appearance). Third, many other historical details -- far too numerous to list here -- are completely overlooked by the film. Since when was the Passover celebrated with =leavened= pita bread, for example? All these lacks don't exactly build my faith in the film makers or in their supposedly expert consultants in religion and culture.

One nit I especially want to pick is the way Mme. Lamandier's musical contributions are described. You may read a longer critique elsewhere, where the soundtrack is offered. Suffice it to say here that Mme. Lamandier's melodic renditions (contrary to advertisement) are almost entirely not in Aramaic, but in biblical Hebrew. The Hebrew melodies themselves were restituted from the Masoretic accentuation by Suzanne Haik-Vantoura, who thankfully is mentioned properly in the film credits. (See my reviews of the book and the recording called THE MUSIC OF THE BIBLE REVEALED, sold elsewhere on Amazon.com.)

There are reasons why in antiquity, the Hebrew Bible was sung aloud (Ps. 119:54) and the Greek New Testament was read aloud (Rev. 1:1-3). One of them is that ""faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God."" Faith typically doesn't come by seeing (as Jesus noted for Thomas' benefit!), let alone by seeing a false and self-limiting concept of Jesus. But at least this particular false concept of Jesus is less perverse than that given to us by THE PASSION.",1097971200,7,3131,4.922348484848484

1997926,5,B0001FT50A,"Definitely a treat. Not only is this word for word from the Bible, but they went to great pains on the sets and costumes. This Jesus is more realistic - one you can take seriously, unlike the happy-go-lucky ""smiley Jesus"" of the Visual Bible's Matthew video (In ""Matthew"", Jesus laughs as he calls someone a hypocrite, or jokes around in comic relief while he's talking about how it would be better for a person to be drowned in the sea than to cause a child to sin.)
I found The Gospel of John absolutely riveting. I couldn't stop watching it. What a great way to actually listen to and understand the words that Jesus said, as recorded by eyewitnesses. In my opinion, it is the best movie about Jesus' life, ever.",1083283200,12,715,4.465648854961832
1997927,5,B0001FT50A,"Using the American Bible Society's Good News Bible, this word-for-word production is meticulous in its detail, and exquisitely acted and filmed. The Gospel of John emphasizes the divinity of Jesus, and has some of the best loved passages of scripture, and perhaps the most well known verse in the New Testament, John 3:16, ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life"".
The superb cinematography, the authenticity of the costumes and sets, and the marvelous acting make this production a must in every Christian film library, and it would also make an excellent teaching tool.
Henry Ian Cusick is brilliant as Jesus; an actor with extensive theatrical credits and a varied life experience, being born in Peru, raised in Trinidad and Scotland, and now living in England. He has a face of depth and beauty, with much expressiveness and a voice that is a joy to listen to. There are scenes with a wide range of emotion, from the sensitivity before the raising of Lazarus, to the driving out of the money changers with passion and rage. This is a strong, vital Jesus, not the ethereal slender man that is sometimes depicted in films, and one that I am sure is more like the Jesus of history.
Other splendid performances come from Scott Handy as John the Baptist, Daniel Kash as Simon Peter, Richard Lintern as the Leading Pharisee, and Stephen Russell as Pontius Pilate.
The narration by Christopher Plummer is masterful.
The lovely outdoor locations were filmed in Southern Spain, and the score by Jeff Danna, using native instruments, is wonderful, and includes the ney, a middle-eastern flute, and an ancient fiddle called a rebab. Soprano Esther Lamandieu adds much to the music with chants in Aramaic, especially during the final credits. Total running time is 3 hours.
The Special Features: ""Behind the Scenes"", total running time 1 hour and 39 minutes.
1: History of The Gospel of John, with comments from the Academic Advisory Committee of Visual Bible International, Inc.
2: Director Philip Saville, who explains why he chose Cusick for the part of Jesus and the difficulty of filming a word-for-word script.
3: Screenwriter John Goldsmith tells how the script was constructed and talks about the absurd charges that the Gospel of John is anti-semitic.
4: Director of Photography Miroslaw Baszak.
5: Production Designer Don Taylor, on building the sets and finding the outdoor locations.

1997928,4,B0001FT50A,"This word for word adaption from the Gospel of John is one of the better Jesus films available.  I love the scenes at the wedding of Cana, the woman at the well, the healing of the lame and blind men, the feeding of the 5,000, and the interaction between Jesus and the Sanhedrin and Pilate after his arrest.  One gets to know the various disciples better in this film than most.
Although never stated in the dialogue of the film, the film portrays Mary Magdaline as a former prostitute who gradually changes over time (all done by the clothes she wears).  Of course, no text in the Bible ever calls Mary a prostitute.  Mary is also portrayed as being present at the Lord's Supper.  That may have been true, but it is not mentioned in the Bible.
The one negative critique I have is that the character of Jesus appears more confrontational than I have viewed him.  One can either read the biblical lines in a confrontational tone of voice, or in a pleading tone of voice.  Here the film tends to take a confrontational tone in the interaction between the Jesus and the Jewish leadership.  Either way would upset the religious leaders because of Jesus' attempt to point out the inconsistencies of the leaders.  But it is the softer approach that better fits my view of Jesus.
All in all, it is a very well made film and I love the fact that computer generation now allows entire biblical towns to be created on screen.",1080000000,6,1415,4.49609375

1997930,5,B0001FT50A,"It has been nearly 6 months since I saw this film.  I have also recently attended Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ.""  Many people have been asking the question, ""If this is really how Jesus died, what was his life like?""  Millions of people these days are longing to SEE Jesus.  ""The Gospel of John"" satisfied that hunger in me.  The film's depiction of a beginning-to-end, word-for-word, Johannine account (I brought my Bible into the theatre to confirm.) helped me to see Christ clearly.  I enjoy hearing sermons and talks on passages from the book of John in church and Bible studies--the movie simply had an edge.  Its wholistic view of the gospel naturally conveyed more of John's inspiration and purpose for the book itself.  We see the famous stories of water into wine (ch. 2), feeding the 5000 (ch. 6), and the raising of Lazarus (ch. 11) in their context.  In such a panoramic encounter these stories are less religious; they become real, personal, powerful.",1079481600,12,975,4.790419161676646
1997931,5,B0001FT50A,"If you are looking for an accurate version of the gospel of John, then this is your DVD. It's well acted and enjoyable to watch. It's a little long to see in one sitting--it's some three hours in length--but what's nice about the DVD is that you can shut it off and come back next time. This is the entire gospel, or 21 biblical chapters in total. It beats reading it on your own, and in three hours you have lived through a book of the Bible! Henry Ian Cusick is a bit serious for the part, as I'm not convinced Jesus was as dour as he portrays, but generally he does a fine job. The crucifixion portrayl is nowhere near as graphic as The Passion of the Christ, yet the DVD box says that it receives a ""PG-13"" rating because of ""violence involving the crucifixion."" However, I had no problem letting my three young girls see this film in the theater.
One minor criticism is the choice of Bible translation that was used, which was the Good News Bible. I'm wondering why a translation like the readable NIV wasn't utilized. The NIV was used in the Matthew videos, and I just think it reads much better. The weakest chapter was the reading of John 1, which was disappointing, to say the least. Otherwise, this is a fine film and is worth the price to keep this set in your library. I also recommend the Matthew videos.",1079395200,10,1317,4.336032388663968

1997933,5,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John Film is an excellent portrayal of the life of Jesus Christ.  It is a faithful word-for-word account of the Book of John, using the Good News Translation (while this translation may not be as sophisticated as some others, it does not compromise any doctrinal truths).  One may watch the film with his or her Bible and follow along verse for verse.
With a totally Inspired script, the Gospel of John Film, accurately proclaims what Jesus Himself proclaimed; that He is God Incarnate, the only Way of salvation.  Not a politically correct claim in this day and age but a timeless Truth for those who hold to Biblical inerrancy.
The cinematography and acting are first rate, on par with Hollywood's best, and capture the unique glory and authority of Jesus.  Scenes such as John 8:58 where Jesus declares, ""Before Abraham was born, I AM"" are powerful indeed and force the viewer into the classic ""trilemma"" of C.S. Lewis (Jesus claimed to be God; Is He a lunatic, a liar, or is He Lord?).  This tension is witnessed by the simple yet dramitic scene where a Pharisee, awestruck by Jesus, asks Him, ""Who are You?""  Who, indeed!  Watch this film and find out.",1078704000,10,1171,4.682926829268292

1997935,5,B0001FT50A,"Is a movie ""bad"" just because it makes us uncomfortable? Interesting how one is either ""for"" or ""against"" this movie. No gray area. I think debate is healthy and enlightening. But I do find the comment that the movie is ""a piece of fiction based on a work of fiction"" to be puzzling. Is this a reason to disqualify a movie? One of my all time favorites is ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" -- should it be disqualified as fiction based on fiction? Then let's throw out Forrest Gump, Trainspotting, 2001, and all of Star Wars.
  Although I do not worship or follow the teachings of Buddha, I find  Siddhartha to be interesting. Same for movies about the Book of Mormon and the Koran.

1997938,5,B0001FT50A,"I just saw the DVD and was surprised at the power of this film.

The Book of John is treated like the finely wrought piece of literature it is. The material is adapted with fidelity as a self-contained work. Seeing it as a complete story is much different than taking elements of the life of Jesus out of context.

A lot can be said about the adaptation, directing, acting, production design and music -- but what stands out is that the sum of these parts is much greater than the separate elements, as fine as they are. Dare I say this is a work of inspiration?

The role of Jesus in world history deserves consideration in the light of the extreme religious fanatacism rampant today from the so-called People of the Book. Who was this person who claimed to be Son of God and Son of man? Factually, the apostle John details only a few points in the life of the Man who conquered death. But John says ""Believe in the resurrection and you have eternal life now."" How radical is that?

""The Gospel of John"" does not shy away from a blunt account of the role of the Roman and Jewish powers in the murder of Jesus; however, the movie makes it abundantly clear why the Pharisees saw Jesus as a threat. In today's world He's still a threat to those who seek power alone,

For me, what jumped out of the film and still echoes in my mind is the several times Jesus asks, ""Why do you hate me?"" That question reverberates in today's headlines.

In a politically correct world, we no longer have public conversations about the subjective truth of the life of Jesus. Or the meaning of that solitary life. With advances in quantum physics, we consider the fundamental nature of of matter, time and consciousness. The Gospel of John touches on all these things with sublime power and insight.

Like in any other movie, this one richly rewards the suspension of disbelief. Surrender to a remarkable film that will haunt you long after final fade out. Finally I understand why those early followers of Jesus said: ""We are not as those who have no hope.""

The original DVD release (quickly out of print) has three discs with detailed extras that cover all the major production elements.

A later release has a two hour version of the film, very nicely edited, as well as the original three hour theatrical version.

Both versions of the film are beautifully transferred in a widescreen format that fills newer 16:9 screens.

1997941,5,B0001FT50A,"When I heard that the movie was three hours long, it concerned me. However, the time went by quickly. In fact I saw the movie three times.

I think the movie was well made and very refreshing to see. I especially liked the fact that it was a word for word depiction from the Bible. This brought down some of the walls of discernment and allowed me to focus on the ""point"". The ""point"" that Jesus was making over and over again, the fact that the only way is through Him. If you know the Father, then you will know Jesus, and if you know Jesus, then you will know the Father.
I most strongly recommend this movie to everyone.",1073260800,7,624,4.2
1997942,5,B0001FT50A,"I saw this film last night and could not believe the caliber of acting, directing, cinematography, music and most important of all, an absolutely amazing portrayal of Jesus and his life as per the Gospel of John.
This is a true film, not just another religious movie that falls a bit short on acting or directing because of just focusing on getting out Jesus' teachings on film, No.  This is truly a film of Oscar caliber.  Even a complete non believer would have to admit to the brilliance of this film as a cimematic accomplishment of groundbreaking proportions.
When you watch it, you're watching a strong Shakespearean-esque cast and a director that has an awesome command of the dialogue and acting choices the cast makes.  It takes a 2000 year old ""script"" word for word and translates it into pure genius on film.
All the scenes are beautifully crafted and the actors all made very strong creative choices that were always in line with the spirit of the gospel.  Jesus was portrayed with a great balance of power, conviction, compassion and even fierceness when appropriate. No one note acting cliches of ""look how holy I am"" in this version.  He was portrayed very multifaceted.  <BR
>Some may find this film hard to watch because it stays completely devoted to The Gospel of John, so that means we don't get to see a fusion of many of Jesus famous parables or known sayings as we get to see in for example the film 'Jesus of Nazereth'.  However, that is part of the brilliance of this film, that they stayed only with the John gospel and found amazing ways to keep it alive and creative.  For example, you would think that the narration might be a bit bland, what could you do with the narrative details in the John Gospel?  Nevertheless, it was done in the tone of a great storyteller weaving out an exciting and moving story that keeps you entralled with a great unfolding story of a great man-Jesus.
There has never been a Jesus film like this one.  A real artists film that is free of controversy (unlike The Last Temptation of Christ which is artistic but very controversial)and glued to the text.
It almost saddens me that this film doesn't seem to be headed towards major release.  If you can't get to see it on the big screen, it's very well worth buying on DVD.  This film truly deserves the overused expression ""Masterpiece"".",1072137600,16,2344,4.621686746987952
1997943,5,B0001FT50A,"I read about ""The Gospel of John"" in the newspapers, and the first thing that crossed my mind was, ""Why another Jesus movie?"" With ""The Passion"" coming just around the corner, ""The Gospel of John"" seemed a bit overshadowed by all of the hype Mel Gibson's movie was getting. Still, I did my research, being a fan of Jesus movies, and found some pretty good reviews. I still didn't expect it to be as good as it was, and as soon as I popped the DVD into my TV I was mesmerized for the entire three hours of the movie.
Henry Ian Cusick is absolutely amazing in his role of Jesus Christ. His only competition would be Robert Powell of ""Jesus of Nazareth"", but Cusick's performance was unlike any I'd seen before (and I've seen ""Jesus"" the miniseries with Jeremy Sisto, ""Jesus"" with Brian Deacon, ""Matthew"" with Bruce Marchiano, ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" with Max Von Sydow, ""King of Kings"" with Jeff Hunter, ""The King of Kings"" with H.B. Warner, ""Jesus of Nazareth"" with Robert Powell, and both versions of ""Jesus Christ Superstar""). His potrayal of Christ is absolutely effortless, which is even more impressive considering the fact that he's speaking word for word from the book of John. Not only does he do wonders with the script, but his overall interpretation of Jesus is unique and, for me, very inspiring. Cusick's Christ knows his mission and carries it out with determination, and, most of all, authority; but this doesn't hold back his human side either, and he is very believable as a loving, caring Christ (the single tear running down his face during the raising of Lazarus was so touching and convincing that it made ME cry). Some may believe that his attitude toward the Pharisees was harsh, and I'll admit that I was a bit taken back when he raised his voice more than once throughout the movie-- but as it progresses, his emotions seem appropriate for someone desperately trying to teach a message of salvation that no one seems to want to accept.
The special effects were very well-done. The scene where Jesus is walking on the water is finally convincing...
The only problem I had with the movie was that it seemed to shy away from the crucifixion. I was a bit disappointed at the way the movie zipped through one of the most crucial parts of the Gospel, especially with Cusick's passionate performance throughout the first couple of hours of the movie. The end result is about two hours and thirty minutes of beautiful cinematography and brilliant acting, and a really ""blah"" finale. The directors really missed the chance to make an impression by failing to utilize the most dramatic part of Christ's life. Cusick could have worked wonders with it.
As for the rest of the cast, each member was perfect. Even the minor roles were believable-- the Pharisees and the people on the street gave very in-depth, and occassionally passionate, performances.
""The Gospel of John"" was one of the best potrayals of Christ I have ever seen. I highly recommend it, and just a heads up--the ""Special Features"" addition to the DVD set is a great bonus!",1071532800,16,3059,4.719626168224299
1997944,4,B0001FT50A,"This movie, based on one of the modern langauage versions of the Gospel of John is fairly accurate and nicly filmed.  Christopher Plummer narrates and the actor portraying Jesus does a fine job.  The strength of the movie is that while it is filmed on a limited budget, the director, Eric Till, is up to the task of trying to get everything he can out of the sets, sights,and people in the movie.

The movie does have some drawbacks, and since most reviews have focused on the positives,  I'm going to briefly mention a couple of negatives: (1) the casting of Mary is just downright poor.  The women is way to old and appears more like a great-grandmother than a mother.  After all, Mary was probably only 14-16 years older than Jesus and this puts a lot of things into historical context (albiet, probably not that important for this film); (2)  Refering to miracles as such and not as ""signs"" misses an important point. The word ""signs"" pointed to something about Christ and John used the Greek equivalent for a reason.

The greatest positive for this movie are the post-resurrection appearances.  This film, unlike others, takes a good 20 minutes or so and focuses on the appearances of Jesus to his disciples after the crucifixion.  I enjoyed these scences very much.

1997946,4,B0001FT50A,"Without question, this is a tremendous overview of the Gospel of John in the New Testiment. The naration throughout the movie, brings the scriptures to a very personal level with its audience.  Jesus is wonderfully portraid as never before with Christpher Plummer showing not only the love that Jesus had for the people, but the wisdom Jesus had from God.  The smile on Christopher Plummer (Jesus')face is refreshingly warm and contagious but, when he begins to ""preach"" the scriptures, its as though the anointing of the Holy Spirit falls apon the actor himself and its amazing the power that comes forth on the screen.
  Unfortunately, the supporting cast, although in appearance they looked good, many were poor actors and brought the over all level of the movie down a bit.  One bad cut of the movie is the last scene showing the three ""dead"" on the cross from a long shot away, unfortunately the actor on the cross to the left of Jesus, looks up, then at Jesus, then quickly realizing the camera is on, lets his head drop.
  Overall though, this 3 hour movie is a keeper and much better than I expected.  The Gospel of John needs to be released for purchase as soon as possible, not only on DVD and Video, but it needs to be release in an Audio formate as well.
  Anyone who is physically blind and unable to  see, will be blessed with this movie by the way it has been produced with the naration.  To the Producer of this film, please get this out to the book stores in all these forms as well as the Wal-Marts and K-Mart stores.

8012004,3,B0001FT50A,"I'm not at all familiar with the Good News version of the Bible--KJV all the way for me as most others I've read have too much modern interpretation for their own good (times change but God and His word never change)--but I think overall this is a good performance, as time and again I've thought of the frustration Christ must have felt when trying to get his message through to those stiff-necked pharisees, and if there's one thing I see in this it's frustration at their stubbornness and unwillingness to listen.

As I watch (and mostly listen) further the dialogue gets so repetitive! He repeats the same exact scripture three, four, sometimes five times before moving on to something else. The constant ""I'm telling you the truth"" become so annoying after a while I have to take a break.

Having said that, I would like just once in my life to see the role of Jesus Christ fulfilled by someone of Jewish heritage because I'm well past a point in my life where a white man is believable to me as Christ.",1523750400,,1008,4.532967032967033
8012005,5,B0001FT50A,One of the best versions of the Gospel on television ever made. I saw it in the theater initially on its debut. Everyone is well casted and convincing. Narration is wonderful. Christopher Plummers voice is soothing and comforting. I hope that one day we will see a bluray since it appears there is an HD master as that is what Amazon Prime streams. I have the old 3 disc DVD set that came loaded with special features. I believe the new packaging is much more condensed with the availability of extras. This is highly recommended.,1523318400,,530,4.589473684210526
8012006,5,B0001FT50A,The gospel of john movie recounts the life of Jesus Christ were Jesus started his mission as the son of God to fulfill the promise made by God  to bring his only begotten son to die for the world to  reminder that he cares for them. The movie describes how Jesus was prophesied  to come and save the world from the worlds sin .Christians  believe that Jesus is the son of God who sits on the write hand side of God interceding  on behave on his children which is us. They also believe that  Jesus is the son of god iwas conceived by the Holy Spirit,1523145600,,548,4.122641509433962
8012007,5,B0001FT50A,"The Gospel of John that was written by John was done so in order to portray Jesus as God in the flesh. This movie honors that in many ways and we are led there from the start as the movie begins with a pure 1st century setting and the narrator reading directly from the Gospel, word for word that is very close to the NKJV version. And right away we get that Jesus is the Word and was at the beginning and that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. ""God in the flesh"". Clearly significant here is that no other god of any other world religion is said to have walked the earth among us humans like Jesus did.
  From here the movie tracks exactly with the written Gospel event for event and including the red words of Jesus with each event. Not all of Jesus words are included but what the movie maker included in order to make the movie realistic without sacrificing truth. This is especially true in the 13th through the 17th chapter where Jesus words are the vast majority of what is written there.
  The Gospel opens with John the baptist baptizing and then doing so with Jesus. We then see Jesus collecting disciples, John the Baptist educating the stubborn Pharisees and Jesus moving with his disciples until He gets to the temple and gets angry with the money changers and sellers in there as He says My Father's house shall be one of prayer. At this point Jesus has established His authority and is on his way to gaining much more following.
  Jesus then gains many followers through his performing miracles of turning water into wine, healing the boy with fever, healing the paralyzed man, feeding the 5,000 with little bread and fishes and healing the blind man. And all along the way with these miracles there are many truths told by Jesus to certain people and groups that cement him acting and talking only as God could. This includes the born again story with Nicodemus, the lady at the well with 5 husbands that only God could know, Peter confessing the Christ, the answer to the Pharisees concerning the adulteress and Jesus continual use of His ""I Am"" statements that liken Him to the I Am of the old testament as in God.
  No other world religion has a figure(their god)  that walked with humans who by so doing proved that their god was truly a god. This is what sets Christianity apart relative to this point. And at this point in the movie Jesus speaks more and more truth to the crowds following Him and to his disciples so we get much of His ministry from the Bible in the movie. This goes on to Jesus entering Jerusalem for Passover prior to the last supper and Judas betraying him before he gets crucified on the cross as He dies for the sins of the world as was God's will for him.
  Next, the resurrection and is the centerpiece of Christianity for Jesus rose from the dead just as He raised Lazarus from the dead earlier in the movie so people would believe that that did happen. What other religion in the world did their god die for those who would come to believe? None. Not only then does the Gospel of John and this movie that represented the Gospel in chronological and finite detail prove out the divinity of Jesus but establishes the uniqueness of the Christian religion.",1523145600,,3209,4.449744463373084
