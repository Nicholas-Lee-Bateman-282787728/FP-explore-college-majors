5312266,5,B009B6XJVQ,"This gives the story of the Lakota uprising held on the Pine Ridge, SD, reservation at the site of Wounded Knee that took place in 1973.  Enter Russell Means and Dennis Banks, two major Indian activists.  With their leadership, they got the Lakota at Pine Ridge to stick together and gather for months in protest of how their nation was being treated then and in the past.  People from other nations throughout the country joined, and it was a serious protest that showed an incredible event of a formidable, proud group of solidarity. With it, the American Indian Movement (AIM) was born and is still active today.  They wanted what was fair:  the removal of the allegedly dictatorial group that was their police; a present-day going-over of some of the Indian treaties that were not honored or unfair.  The FBI was there with guns; the Indians had guns; a few people on both sides died. The Indian nations had been forgotten.  Things were bad for many on the reservations. This showed how they could get together in numbers and in strength for future generations.  Told thru current-day interviews and a lot of original film footage, it did accomplish a change in how Indians are treated and brought their situation to the forefront.  A major learning experience when viewed.",1389484800,6,1277,4.821100917431193

I am Caucasian and am absolutely horrified at the treatment the American Indians have received since the Europeans settled in this country.  We all should bear the responsibility of atoning for the past and present injustices we have dealt the American Indian. This film does a very fine job of explaining the plight of the American Indians during the early years of the formation of AIM and the second ""battle"" of Wounded Knee.

5312274,3,B009B6XJVQ,"A Good Day to Die is a documentary about Native American activist Dennis Banks and the American Indian Movement (AIM).  It covers the difficulties facing Native people  in the 1970's and the ways in which Dennis Banks, among others, led AIM to take a stand against injustice.  The film touches on Banks' early life, the founding of AIM and its many acts, including: petitioning Washington, D.C., Custer South Dakota, and the occupation of Wounded Knee.
  I would say the purpose of this film is to provide some historical context and to inspire people, native and non-native, alike, to be brave enough to make a difference.  This film shows the plight of urban Indians and shows the way their people, specifically Dennis Banks, rose up to take a stand.  This film provided almost entirely native voices, which I think is important, because rarely do Native peoples get to explain their own history.  They did include a few with opposing opinions, but it was clear who was in control of the content.  I loved seeing the way Indians embraced the civil rights movement because that is rarely mentioned in today's academia.  They included actual live footage from riots and sit-ins, which was really fascinating.
  A major focus of the documentary was how Native people were affected by the injustices in America.  There were a lot of emotional anecdotes that left me moved and concerned.  There was a lot about politics and policies and activism.  They discussed language, but this film really focused more on the political aspects rather than the cultural aspects, but then again, it is rather difficult to separate the two.
 I think this documentary would be a great fit for an American Indian Literature and Culture class because of its strong use of native perspectives.  There is so much to be learned by looking at a situation from a different perspective, and this piece provides that alternative perspective.  You can see just from listening to government representatives' stories versus the Native Americans' stories that much can be lost when the native perspective is not fairly represented.  Though there were parts that dragged on a bit, this documentary implies that the founding of AIM and their work in the civil rights movement helped change the culture of Urban Indians.  Something so defining certainly deserves to be included in a course such as ours.
This documentary was appealing in many ways.  There was history on Dennis Banks and his childhood.  I found that part really endearing.  Hearing from Native people's about abuse they suffered in boarding schools definitely tugged at my heartstrings.  I  also found the live-action footage from the sit-ins and the petitioning particularly compelling.  It is one thing to hear firsthand accounts of these things happening, but it is a whole other to see and hear them for yourself.  The members of AIM do not paint themselves out to be passive victims, nor is it completely anti-white.  This film lets you decide how you feel while presenting a history.  There was something appealing and interesting for everyone:  men, women, young, old, natives and non-natives.
The main themes prevalent in this film were activism, resistance, and memory.  Viewers can tell how intensely emotional these memories are for the interviewees.  This is the story of one man, and the way he and his group demanded to be treated equally.  Even though it could be a bit repetitive or tedious at times, this film was overall inspiring.  I learned a lot about native history during the civil rights movement.  In school, when we talk about civil rights we talk a  lot about Martin Luther King Jr., and even groups like the Black Panthers, or the Klu Klux Klan, but rarely (if ever)  have I learned about AIM or the gross injustices caused against Native Americans.
Overall, I believe A Good Day to Die is an important Native American text.  I learned a lot about history and the trials and tribulations of urban American Indians.  Although it was not always the most exciting documentary, and perhaps a bit on the long side,  it was interesting and informative.  It had some unforgettable moments and moving monologues.  I would certainly recommend this film to someone who is interested in learning a little about Native American history and the strength of its people.",1365724800,24,4315,4.96094839609484
5312275,5,B009B6XJVQ,"When all is said and done, the stories of the Native American freedom movement contain all the courage that makes for true heroism. This film captures the spirit of those who began the American Indian Movement and turbulent times that they struggled in. Filled with newsreel clips and historic photos and video, this is a very balanced telling of the events that defined the Native American civil rights movements of the 60's and 70's. Though focused on Dennis Banks, many other leaders from the movement are included here, too.

5312285,5,B009B6XJVQ,"For the ""Novice"" person on Native American Indian affairs, this is a MUST SEE"" film. I have studied this subject for many years since I was U.S.Secret Service in Wash. D.C. in 1974 after Nixon left office.(Ford & Carter)
Our Government has committed ""Genocide"" against our own Native Americans ever since Spanish and English
explorers landed since 1492.
Instead of working with People's of a different culture, we had ""Treaties"" that have been agreed to but OUR Government has FAILED and LIED and consistently Violated Native Americans treaties Ever since George Washington was President. All Treaties to my knowledge have been violated and there is still no current treaty at this time.
Federal Civil Rights lawsuits that were won by the Native Americans are still not resolved and over $100,000 Millions dollars is to be paid out but it is NOT enough for the Lives of past killed Native Americans and Lands that have been taken due to the Mineral rights(Gold, Radium, Silver, Oil, and other natural resources, etc..)
Dennis J.Banks was/is the leader of the AIM American Indian Movement, but there hasn't been any real publicity for years probably due to ""Illegal"" acts by the FBI, U.S. Marshall, Military since 1973 when the ""Wounded Knee Incident"" was the staging area back in 1973. 2 FBI agents were killed by Leonard Peltier and has was convicted over it and bragged about it to others. Anna Mae Aquash an AIM member was killed cause high ranking members Including women, thought she was an FBI informant and was also killed. A black man named Ray Robinson was also killed as well as many others on both sides. Research this as I have: [...]  Since then, Russel Means and John Trudell have just recently died. Dennis J. Banks is one of the original founders who is left. Banks ran for VP in the 3rd party in California. [...] There are still many unanswered questions and America needs to take a hard look at Protecting Our Native Americans. There are many Secrets to many other things going on in our Universe right under our own noses, but the ""White Man"" has ignored Nature and he suffers due to the Ignorance. The Native Americans are an ancient and wise culture and we need to protect them, not slaughter them. I do not have Native American blood in my veins, but I was born in sacred Indian Lands in the Heart of Oklahoma which is still part of Federal Land that WE took from Native Americans. We are ALL Native Americans at some point. Do not hurt our Native American sisters & Brothers. Support them in their struggles.",1482019200,,2532,4.728506787330317

The leaders and organization of AIM have had this elaborate dream that they were the saviors of the Indian people in South Dakota during the 1970's.  Him along with Russell Means, Leonard Peltier (serving life sentences for the murder of FBI agents Jack Williams and Robert Coler) are nothing more than frauds who should be erased from any form of civil rights history or American Indian History/Studies.  There are numerous cases, eyewitness accounts, Federal/State court case dockets regarding this man and the organization American Indian Movement that TERRORIZED the people of the Oglala Nation, Pine Ridge South Dakota during the 1970's.  Please research and read into the facts before you are duped into the haze of misinformation by these individuals.  Yes the story of the assimilation of Native Americans is tragic, but it should NOT be told by Dennis Banks or anyone associated with AIM.

5312308,5,B009B6XJVQ,"Through interviews, A Good Day to Die, gives us the background for the AIM and the struggle for recognition and civil rights for Native Americans. When you hear about how Native American culture and peoples were treated in the early 20th century -- removing children from their families and bringing them to boarding schools that were more focused on removing the culture and language and tracking the students into vocational jobs, etc. it's heartbreaking.  The interviews show how the different individuals came together to speak out -- the failed attempts to reach out to Washington D.C., the confrontation and violence, the court trial, and the work that the leaders of the civil rights movement did throughout.

I didn't know that the AIM existed, much less that they continue to do work on behalf of Native American tribes and people.  This is very important part of US history. We learn about the African American struggle in popular culture and schools, it is just as important to give time to learn about the civil rights movement and the Native Americans, to take steps to treat them better and share resources.",1452902400,12,1121,4.952127659574468

Most are native peoples but there are good interviews with non-natives such as US Marshals, the Judge from the Custer trial, a sheriff, etc...  There are other reviews that provide more info, so I'll only ask this question.  I saw the copyright as 2010.  Russell Means passed in 2012.  I don't know why there weren't any interviews with Mr Means for the movie.  Mr Means was a co-founder of AIM with Dennis Banks, directly involved with Mr Banks in leading AIM in the experiences shown in the movie, and was shown in the older footage of AIM in the 60s and 70s.  I watched the movie and kept wanting to hear Mr Means perspective reflecting back on AIM in the 60s and 70s.  But, ...???  So, I don't know why there were no interviews with Mr Means, but that's the one omission that I noticed and didn't understand.  Yet, overall the movie is excellent.

5312330,5,B009B6XJVQ,"Co-Founder of the American Indian Movement Dennis Banks narrates most of this DVD in which Native-Americans have fought for the dignity and respect denied them by such agencies as the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management.  Abuses such as being denied speaking their own language and retaining their cultural values they describe being bullied to the point where you must respond to the bully before anything is going to change.

The takeover of Mount Rushmore, the riot that took place at Custer, South Dakota, due to the murder of an Indian, and the 1973 takeover at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, are fully covered.  Banks along with Clyde Bellecourt, and Russell Means were all instrumental in the American Indian Movement.  Banks discusses his imprisonment and subsequent release.  This DVD is 1 1/2 hours long and I found it to be very worthwhile and not at all boring.  In fact it was very educational.  I organized a trip to the Black Hills of South Dakota in 1974 for a group of Little Leaguers and one of our stops was at Wounded Knee where Clive Gildersleeve, the owner of the Wounded Knee Trading Post came from his home in Rushville, Nebraska, to relate his views of the takeover of the previous year.  He mentioned that several of the protesters were from other parts of the country and he had warned those responsible for the historical marker that the language stating what happened in 1890 was offensive to Native Americans.

This DVD also contains numerous interviews with various Native Americans including the daughter and grand daughter of Dennis Banks.

5312336,4,B009B6XJVQ,"Very good movie! I believe Dennis was and is a very good man who is older and wiser, now. I'm not sure that, looking back, he would change the way things were done.  The US government has NEVER lived up to their treaty promises!! Sometimes, one must do what has to be done to get others (the government) to take notice and to listen to reason.  It is my hope and my prayer that sometime soon, before it is too late, our government will do the right thing and rectify the wrongs that have been inflicted on all Native People!",1404777600,,524,4.23

5312338,5,B009B6XJVQ,"I am from Northern Minnesota and happened to live on 13th and Franklin in Minneapolis in 1969. I was involved in Numerous actions as they were called. Dennis Banks and Clyde were what we would call shot-callers. They knew the ultimate goal was to call attention to the American Indian cause by any means necessary. All these other organizations of darker color were getting big money from the government. Who were we, except Indian people who went through the courts to try and mediate issues versus taking to the streets like this other race did. We went through the court system much to long without any resolution. Dennis and Clyde the visionaries they are, realized a different more direct action needed to be implemented. This video chronicles the genesis of a great group. The video is outstanding as are the messages and stories contained within.

Dennis remains a hero to our Anishinabeg people, and this video is a tribute to a great man.",1401235200,4,947,4.809815950920245
5312339,5,B009B6XJVQ,"It's been a while since I've seen this film. Brings back too many painful childhood memories, memories of my uncles,cousins, relatives drunk on alcohol, high on drugs ,any thing to numb the pain of our people lost between two worlds with out hope or direction.
For any one wishing to see a sliver of the daily issues Native Americans face on reserves across the U.S., then by all means please watch this film with an open heart. I want to set one point straight right here though. I read in another review where the writer was writing about A.I.M. in the past tense and I beg to differ. The issues are all the same, and there are still many of us still fighting any way we can for Our lands and Our rights, for Our Voices to be heard! We have Not gone away, we will never go away. We will fight for Our Rights until we have either won them back or the government buries the last of the Lakota and we can fight no more.
This film should be shown to every history class in the U.S. IMO to show the truth of the American government and how far they will lower their moral standards to gain what they wish to own.  I'm using my wife's sign in so I'll put my name to this here ,

5312341,5,B009B6XJVQ,"This is an excellent well done history film. From the 60's and 70's in which most of the historical coverage is about the American Indian Movement or AIM as it is mostly refer to. What were the reasons for its creation?
Since 1492 Indigenous Peoples have been and continue to be mistreated by foreign invaders who have a complete disregard for the rights of Indigenous way of life let alone the People.
Greedy, fork tongue, and "" they gave us the bible and took the land"" are but a few reasons for the formation of AIM. Of course much is left out and a lot people who were part of it. Still what it did cover is in the amount of time of the film is a lot of historical coverage.
The United States has a habit of pointing their finger at other countries as to their human rights abuses. Well perhaps they should start by cleaning up their own abuses. And not just in feel good words, ""actions speak louder than words"" This is what film is all about, the Indigenous Peoples taking a stand against the historical injustice.
Today two key issues are Keystone and Washington Redskins mascot issue. ""Free your mind and the rest will follow"" Free the People..",1396742400,8,1152,4.438679245283019
