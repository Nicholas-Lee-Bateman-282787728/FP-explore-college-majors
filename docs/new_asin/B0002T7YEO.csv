8031551,2,B0002T7YEO,"Very Disappointed. I was expecting something like the caliber of The Celluloid Closet, a good documentary of gay cinema but it was rather a joke.",1385078400,,145,4.84
8031552,5,B0002T7YEO,"In response to the post from the person who was disappointed in HOMO PROMO, I just wanted to briefly explain that HOMO PROMO is a collection of original LGBT movie trailers and it really offers a very entertaining way to experience the history of LGBT representation in cinema in just over an hour of viewing time. Personally, I am a trailer fanatic. I love seeing vintage movie trailers -- they really don't make them like they used to! So, speaking as the curator of this collection, I hope you'll enjoy it for what it is! The DVD also includes a fabulous extra feature which is the short film QUEENS AT HEART (a 1965 short that gives a terrific portrait of four male-to-female transsexual women talking about there lives in New York City). Thanks!",1228348800,6,750,4.646616541353383
8031553,1,B0002T7YEO,"This is possibly the worst DVD I have ever seen.  It's not a movie.  It's not even a documentary, as it claims to be.  It's nothing more than an endless collection of movie trailers purporting to be somehow gay-related.  The sound and picture quality of all these trailers is uniformly atrocious, to the point where it is frequently difficult to know what you are watching.  There is no narration, no analysis and no explanation as to why some of these trailers are included.  If you have absolutely nothing to do, your time would be better spent staring at a blank TV screen.  Save yourself the pain of watching this abomination.  I only wish there was a ""no star"" rating, because this bomb doesn't even deserve one.",1116892800,7,717,4.634920634920635
8031554,5,B0002T7YEO,"Queer Filmmaker (2005's The Joy of Life) and Sundance Entry Blue Diary, film historian (2004's The Queer Movie Poster Book & 1996's The Ulimate Guide to Lesbian & Gay Film & Video) curates this collection of trailers for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer movies which charts the history and marketing of gay and lesbian films.  The hysterically funny, occasionally infuriating, and ultimate moving trailers mirror society's attitudes towards queer people over time. What's remarkable is how few of these trailers tell you explicitly what the film is about, relying instead on titillating exploitation or subtle inference to convey the film's essence.  Includes trailers for Ed Wood's Glen or Glenda, Dirk Bogarde's Victim, Mart Crowley's The Boys in the Band, the camp classics The Gay Deceivers and Norman, is That You?, and dramas such as The Children's Hour, The Damned and Sunday, Bloody Sunday and The Sergeant. Entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny, if you love gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender filmmaking, you must own Homo Promo (and companion The Queer Movie Poster Book).",1095033600,16,1099,5.383720930232558
