2855764,5,B000R17RQM,"Once again HBO has produced a film for television that will doubtless be a success not only in its televised version but on theater release and/or DVD.  LIFE SUPPORT as written by Nelson George, Hannah Weyer and Jim McKay and directed with power and restraint by Nelson George has the courage to delve deeply into the problem of AIDS in the black community and the result is a film that is not only informative but also a story of tremendous power about the sequelae of HIV infection on the lives of those infected and their families.

Based on the true story of a mother who as a crack cocaine addict became infected by her boyfriend's indiscriminate use of a shared needle and with the discovery of her sero-positive status turned her life around to become a powerful positive role model and AIDS activist in the black community.  Ana Willis (Queen Latifah in a sterling performance) is married to Slick (Wendell Pierce), both of whom are HIV positive and both work, living with their young daughter Kim (Ravelle Parker) and trying to cope with their estranged daughter Kelly (Rachel Nicks, a true find of a young artist!) who elects to live with her grandmother, Ana's beleagured mother (Anna Deavere Smith, once again proving she is one of the premiere actors of the day).  Kelly and Ana are at odds and their strained relationship is one of the evidences of the cruelties of the aftermath of ex-addicts manner of going straight.  Kelly's closest friend is Omari (Evan Ross, gifted actor son of Diana Ross!) who is gay and is very ill with AIDS. Kelly asks for Ana's help when Omari disappears and it is through this act that the story plunges forward into the self help groups of AIDS patients Ana chairs, Ana's visit to Omari's boyfriends such as MJ (Darrin Dewitt Henson) who is very much on the down low, and Ana's ultimate finding herself as a mother, a wife, a caregiver and a fine activist in doing her part to prevent the spread of the dread disease form which she suffers.

The large cast is excellent with outstanding performances by Queen Latifah, Anna Deavere Smith, and Rachel Nicks and strong work by Evan Ross, Tracee Ellis Ross (another of Diana Ross' progeny) et al.  The beauty of the film is the avoidance of grandstanding and overacting: the message is driven home quietly and with respect. It is a fine film that should be seen by everyone.

2855801,4,B000R17RQM,"Though Queen Latifah is less known for her dramatic skills, films such as Life Support drive home the point that this singer turned actress has the chops to build a serious career in movies.

Thanks to her work on the sitcom ""Living Single"", everyone knows that she's funny & musicals such as ""Chicago"" and ""Hairspray"" prove that her singing talent extends far further than rap. Here, Latifah captivates the audience with her understated performance. Based on the true-life story of writer-director Nelson George's HIV-positive sister, Andrea Williams, Life Support stars Latifah as Ana, a recovering junkie who tries to atone for her seedy past by being a loving mom to her 9-year-old daughter.

In addition, she takes care of her husband, who also has HIV. But Life Support, an AIDS awareness facility that is an integral part of her life, is where Ana feels most at home. As the movie unfolds, we see how far Ana has come from her rocky beginnings, and how much more she has to accomplish before she can repair the damage from her past.

One that seems irreparable is the sticky relationship she has with her estranged teenage daughter, who lives with Ana's mother (Anna Deavere Smith). While there are some moments in the film that are overly maudlin, giving it more of a Movie of the Week feel than that of a feature film, Latifah's deft touch--as well as superb acting by the supporting cast--make Ana someone we all would like to help, yet are wary of befriending.",1391558400,,1471,4.783464566929134

And she also had to put up with her mother's criticism. And she has to earn her oldest daughter's love and trust because of her drug habit. And of course her husband's mess.

I just think she's a positive person that has contributed alot. She not only contributes to the black community, but she reaches out to women of all colors and backgrounds.  This movie is a must-see and crosses all color barriers.  HIV is something that can affect any and everyone in the human community.  It definitely made me see a doc to confirm my own health and peace of mind.  Unfortunately not everyone's status will be negative and this movie shows what life can be like for someone who is HIV positive.  It was an enlightening and realistic view of a woman's life as she struggled to maintain her family relationships as well as her health.  I highly recommend this one.",1338249600,,855,4.653333333333333

It shows that there is a lot of pain, unforgiveness, forgiveness and redemption out there. In all, I feel this is a must see movie and highly recommend it.",1321660800,,616,4.3304347826086955

I can't say that guys would really get into this movie, I didn't. For the women, positive or not, this is a movie that will touch heartstrings. Life Support does have a few lighter moments. Combined, when a movie makes me laugh and also shed a tear, I rate it as a good movie-and that is purely personal.

2855833,5,B000R17RQM,"Before I ordered Life Support from Amazon, I caught the film on late night cable television. As the mother of an adult son who died from AIDS two years ago, I was naturally interested in the content and the message.

Initially, I wanted to see if the characters and the information about HIV and AIDS was as close to accurate as I needed them to be, but I became absorbed in the characters and their individual stories, which is the way this disease happens. One person at a time.

There may be an epidemic among certain races and ages, but getting down to it, is the fact that each person affected, and there are numbers that statistics do not cover, including scads of children, parents, friends and relatives who do not HAVE the virus, but are affected by it's devastation for the rest of their lives, after losing someone they love so dearly.

I appreciate this movie and would recommend it to anyone. Not just a family who is affected by AIDS but to those who for the moment, have not been touched by it.

The circle of those affected draws tighter and tighter. We cannot allow ourselves to be silent due to the fact that it has not come knocking on our doors yet. If it has not, I am pretty sure that in one way or another, just like drugs, we all get affected by this killer of dreams and usurper of hope.

2855842,5,B000R17RQM,"Life Support takes a frank and interesting look at the AIDS epidemic and its effect on African-American women and other people in the United States today. The plot moves along well and the acting is very convincing; Queen Latifah leads a fine cast and the cinematography is excellent. Life Support truly proves that Queen Latifah can not only handle a serious dramatic role--she can truly make it into a tour de force.

The movie begins with us seeing Ana (Queen Latifah) who is a former drug addict who apparently caught HIV from her husband Slick many years ago. Fortunately, Ana's children are not infected with HIV; but Ana's older daughter Kelly (Rachel Nicks) lives with Ana's mother Lucille (Anna Deavere Smith) because both Ana and Slick were too dependant on drugs at the time Kelly was born to properly raise her. On the brighter side, Ana and Slick do have custody of their younger daughter Kim. In addition, Ana works at a social service agency that serves women with HIV to make their lives go as smoothly as possible. Ana is appropriately aggressive in making sure people get educated about HIV; she goes around Brooklyn, New York handing out condoms so that people can have safe s** and she always reminds people they can get counseling at the clinic where she works.

The plot thickens! Kelly's childhood friend Amare (Evan Ross) is essentially homeless after his parents died and tough minded Lucille threw him out of her own home about a year earlier for stealing some jewelry. Kelly wants her grandmother Lucille to take Amare back in but Lucille simply won't hear of it; meanwhile Amare continues to ""get high."" Worse yet, Amare causes Kelly and Ana some serious concern when he leaves his own HIV medicine at Kelly's house after he sneaks in one day to hang out with Kelly when Lucille isn't home.

The plot can go anywhere from here. Will Amare be able to get his life back in order--and how can Ana and the others track him down if they even can track him down to get his life back in order? There is also a lot of tension between Lucille and her daughter Ana over Ana's drug abuse all those years ago--it seems that Lucille hasn't truly forgiven Ana even all these years later. There's even trouble between Ana and Slick when they have their own frequent disagreements. No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!

Life Support is a fine movie that deals with the HIV crisis with a refreshing, unapologetic honesty and we also get some mighty wonderful performances. The music that goes along with the film fits in nicely; and I recommend this film.",1234483200,,2589,4.6960352422907485

I was really excited when I learned earlier this year that she was to play this role. As HBO doesn't screen in this country I knew I was going to have to hope that it made it to DVD and luckily, it eventually did. I ordered my copy without a second thought.

This is a real life story based on director Nelson George's sister Andrea Williams who is HIV positive. Latifah plays Ana, a character based on Williams and we watch Ana as she works hard as a community AIDS activist to spread the safer sex/HIV prevention message through Life Support, the organisation she works for in Brooklyn, New York. We also watch her while she struggles to redeem herself for her past life decisions (she was a crack addict, apparently) not only in her own eyes but in the eyes of her mother Lucille, played by Anna Deavere Smith, and of her teenage daughter Kelly, played by Rachel Nicks, custodial rights to whom she had to give up to her mother as a result of her troubled past. We also watch her as she negotiates another challenging relationship in her life, i.e. with her husband Slick, played by the excellent Wendell Pierce, who is also living with HIV. It's an amazing piece of work and we get a glimpse into what it's really like for people (mostly women though, interestingly enough - I was like, where are the men?) whose lives have been impacted by this virus. It's not always easy to watch. Look out for a brilliant performance by Evan Ross who plays Amare, a troubled young HIV+ gay man who is best friends with Kelly. It's truly gut wrenching to watch him flounder, trying to deal with a whole range of issues, without the support he so desperately needs.

On a lighter note though, Brooklyn is one of my favourite places on the planet and it was really fun to see the various great location pieces Nelson George used in the movie. I think it is noteworthy though, that this movie hasn't had the profile that I feel it deserves. It makes me wonder why not. It could be that the message I got from the movie (that HIV is out there, it's real and we're all at risk) might not be one that audiences are willing to take on board. Given that HIV/AIDS are collectively a bigger problem in our communities than they were when they first appeared 25 years ago (and not a smaller one as one might have hoped), I wonder if we have the right attitude. People are still getting infected, people are still dying and it's not just gays, drug addicts or people from sub-Saharan Africa either.

Soapbox minute over, I think it was incredibly brave of Andrea Williams to put herself forward like this, of Nelson George to tackle the issue head on and of all the actors who agreed to participate in this project, Latifah most of all. But then she's never been afraid of taking on a challenge. I've invited friends round to watch it and have lent it to others so they can invite their friends round to watch it. I truly feel this is a movie we (especially black people) all need to see. I highly recommend it.

Latifah received a well-earned Emmy nomination for her performance but was pipped to the post by an equally deserving Helen Mirren who won for her performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prime-Suspect-7-The-Final-Act/dp/B000R349HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prime Suspect 7 - The Final Act</a>.

2855850,5,B000R17RQM,"I'm a clinical social worker working in a residential substance abuse program, and this movie depicts the reality that people, especially women experience. In looking at it through the recovery part, you see the main character (Queen Latifah) go through some defense mechanisms and shows some relapse behavior, but it also shows the importance of having a support group, regardless if it's for addiction or for HIV support. It makes you want to explore with clients the attitudes, beliefs, and myths of people living with HIV and also exploring the attitudes, beliefs, and myths of addiction and addicts as well. It also shows a great scene between a grandmother and a granddaughter that gives insight on the pain and hurt, the consequences, that the family members of an addict go through. This film shows the true meaning of living life on life's terms and that one is powerless of what others think, say, and do. All the actors did a superb job in this film.

2855852,5,B000R17RQM,"With the release of Life Support, officially selected in the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, HBO Films further establishes itself as the go-to location for powerful actors looking for solid, unflowery, unapologetically good films. Following in the tradition of Geoffrey Rush and Charlize Theron in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers and Annette Bening and Ben Kingsley in Mrs. Harris, Queen Latifah has become a part of the tradition of excellence with her turn as HIV positive AIDS activist Ana Wallace.

In the deeply personal and profoundly moving film based on the life of writer/director George Nelson's sister Andrea Williams, Queen Latifah not only has the opportunity to help explore the effect of the HIV/AIDS crisis on the African-American community, but to display her tremendous acting talent along the way. As Ana Wallace, Latifah has never been more human, more endearing, or more inspiring. Equal parts stubborn selfishness and selfless activist, Latifah portrays Wallace (and the real-life Williams, who makes an appearance in the film herself) as a real woman with real problems, who learns to rise above it all in order to help herself and her family.

Using real people in key group discussion scenes, Nelson gives his film an almost documentary feel, and the strong performances from Anna Deavere Smith as Wallace's stern but loving mother, Wendell Pierce as her supportive and honest husband, and Rachel Nicks as her estranged daughter make the screen crackle with emotion and energy. Darrin Dewitt Henson (of Darrin's Dance Grooves) even steps in for a surprisingly powerful turn as a hotheaded record producer. Throughout the film, no actor misses a beat. Either the casting director should be thanked profusely for such ideal casting, or Nelson just has a special knack for getting exactly the right performance out of each of his actors.

The acting is phenomenal, the story is moving and engaging, and the backdrop of the Brooklyn streets never fails to deliver. In short, Life Support is a triumph on all accounts. Latifah will doubtless be looking at some nominations for this role and perhaps she'll begin to be offered the kind of roles her talent truly deserves. In George Nelson's video diary (included on the disc), viewers can clearly see his mood and feelings towards the film changing and growing as the film progresses and each scene is captured on film. Audiences will feel much the same way as they watch the film head towards its dramatic and poignant conclusion.",1186272000,,2501,5.095121951219512
