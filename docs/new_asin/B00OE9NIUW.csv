8683337,4,B00OE9NIUW,"In this case, two girls; the gun, which is almost another character, enters the film in an unexpected manner and is brandished infrequently yet effectively. In Bloom is a real slow burn, which undoubtedly will not please everyone. A central theme from the opening (that remains in place) seems to be the stifling socioeconomic climate during a bitter civil war, expressed on the screen as dysfunctional family life, bread lines, and the threat of violence from boys too young to be called men.

The heroines of In Bloom are more or less jaded by the age of 14 (obviously growing up too quickly, by most contemporary Western standards) but still celebrating their lives whenever and wherever possible. At first it is difficult to connect with them, but after you become acclimated to their surroundings it is tough not to admire their perseverance when so much is rigged against them. Not a complex plot, it is nonetheless potent as a snapshot of history that will otherwise be forgotten.

Another reviewer posted a comment about the picture quality being on par with illegal copies. Point taken, but it's actually not all that bad for a DVD. Then again, I own a Region 2 pressing (check the price, it is much cheaper) released by Fusion Media Sales / Artificial Eye, so it may be of different quality than the Region 1 release.",1440201600,3,1327,4.790393013100437
8683338,2,B00OE9NIUW,"This movie is about as accurate a depiction of Eastern Europe that you can get on film (it's actually even bleaker in real life). People are outwardly rude and unhappy and have a lot of reasons to be that way. They live in poverty, they have very little prospects (especially the women). The women are treated like garbage and even if they want to do something with their lives some disgusting despicable criminal usually gets their hands on them first. It's no different then today with the online scamming with 70% coming from Eastern Europe through fake dating sites, etc. The problem with this movie is right when it starts getting interesting the movie just ends. As if the directors were trying to copy the new unbelievably frustrating indie faze where the movie just ends with no closure and even less sense. It's become the new in and I hope it goes out real quick. This could have been a great movie but instead it is an hour and a half of the misery that is Georgia, Ukraine, or any of the ex-Soviet countries. It paints a vivid and honest picture of life there but I think we all have a general idea of what life is like in a forgotten country of the old iron curtain. MISERY. Just as a warning- this really isn't a spoiler but the ending really disappoints (Did I say that already!?). I wouldn't waste your time.",1426809600,,1324,4.475206611570248
8683339,3,B00OE9NIUW,"Some parts of the movie were very poor quality pictures, as I have seen with illegal copies. High price for such compromised quality. The movie itself was very good",1425686400,2,164,4.689655172413793

8683341,5,B00OE9NIUW,"Set against the backdrop of the war in Georgia in 1992 we meet two fourteen year old school friends Eka and Natia. They both have dysfunctional families; one dealing with an absent father and the other wishing hers was as he is an alcoholic. They lead a bleak existence where bread is rationed yet everyone seems to be able to get hold of cigarettes, sexism seems to be rife and life can be quite cruel.

The story unfolds around Natia being wooed by more than one suitor and the consequences of making the wrong decision. This is set against the background of the real World and every day life existence. Told in a kind of docudrama way, we have some upsetting scenes and some show stopping performances from a very young cast. The whole thing has a vibrancy and believability that just grabs you and makes you go with it. It is also one of those films where you may think certain scenes are `fillers', but if you bear with it they always reveal more of the characters and deepen an already thick plot.

In Georginan with good sub titles and a run time of around 100 minutes. This is a powerful and understated film that deserves a wider audience. Co-writer and director Nina Ekvtimishvili has made a big screen debut with a film to be proud of and I think we are going to see a lot more from her and I for one think the next film can not come soon enough - absolutely recommended.",1421366400,3,1382,4.373540856031128
8683342,4,B00OE9NIUW,"A low-key, tender, and, in the end, disturbing story of female adolescence set in a time and place not often depicted in cinema:  post-Soviet Georgia circa the early 1990s.  The overcast instability of the environment, with its frantic bread lines, civil conflicts, and general atmosphere of potential doom, lends extra fascination and immediacy to the subdued story of teenage best friends (Lika Babluani and Mariam Bokeria, both graceful and natural) and the cruelties visited upon them by ambivalent adults, chauvinistic male peers, and the dire economic and political state of their country.  Among these cruelties is an act of so-called ""bride kidnapping,"" which is troubling in and of itself, but even more gut-wrenching are the resigned responses of people who should protest.  The film's cinematographer is Oleg Mutu, known for his European Film Award-winning lensing of the monumental 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days.  The visual quality here is similar:  shots are long (at times extremely so), hand-held, and largely in dowdily evocative shades of grey.",1419811200,2,1061,5.323353293413174
