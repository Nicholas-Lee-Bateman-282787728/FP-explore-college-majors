2569566,5,B000FJH5JU,"I really liked this anime.
As mentioned, there's a huge difference between this short anime series and the manga.
I've read up to volume 22 of the manga and while they toss in a lot of cool new weapons and bad guys and details that aren't in the anime... they direction is totally opposite after (SPOILER ALERT) everyone but kurono dies.  In the manga he pretty much forgets about everyone until he get his hundred points 6 months later, at which point he ditches them immediately anyway... which I found pretty lame.
The manga is just too busy for the character development and attachments you make in the anime.
All in all, both an awesome series and an awesome manga.
Very disturbing, however, at points, I'd only rank it second to Berserk.",1207785600,,743,4.628787878787879
2569567,4,B000FJH5JU,"Season 2 of Gantz all in all was good entertainment. A lot of fantastic action, full of blood and gore. What I didn't care for about this is that the first couple minutes of each episode replays the ending of the previous episode and the scenes are a bit drawn out. It reminds me of the Dragonball series. Also the ending is a bit disappointing as I was watching it I had high anticipation to see what happens. Otherwise I found this anime to be very entertaining and very colorful characters.",1182384000,,493,4.428571428571429
2569568,5,B000FJH5JU,"Season 2 has more sex, gore, and violence.  It is a great anime that is so much fun too watch.  Ending is confusing to some but I think you will still be satisfied.  Extras are great on the set and animation is top notch.",1177200000,,221,3.977272727272727
2569569,2,B000FJH5JU,"As time goes by and I learn more and more about gantz I have to say that I don't like too much about it. I'll explain, most people know that gantz released the anime before the beginning stages of the manga was even done. So it's like they release this anime to us that looks amazing with a very hard and unique story but the anime goes nowhere. After the first season so much has not been covered and so many of the players have not made it this far. As beautiful as gantz is it is too far advanced for itself. You could say that this series is way ahead of its time or you could say its creators had too much on their plate. In the second season some new players are added and some new weapons as well but other than that not much is new. Kei's lust for Kishimoto gets more intense and Kato's pain increases as well.

That's basically all you really get from gantz and as my friend Antonio said the ending is too ambiguous and I know why, it's because it's done but it's not done. The anime is done but the story is way far from done. Here is a good example, in the anime the characters just die but in the manga you find out that most of the characters that died can be revived. There are crazy weapons like the Gantz bike that are never introduced, and characters you never see, everything is hurried to just end the anime. They have almost ruined any chances of actually releasing a classic gantz anime because they didn't write the manga and use it as the guide for the anime.

This isn't like other anime where they used the manga to make the anime and left out some details, this is just some slop someone put together to keep people occupied until the manga came out. Even worse they're not making the manga for Americans yet so who knows how long people will have to wait to know the truth about gantz. The manga has 20 volumes and is still ongoing but still none licensed for the U.S.. I really don't know what to tell fans except to learn Japanese and try to get a Japanese copy of the manga but other than that you'll have to wait out until it gets licensed in the U.S.. This is still an ok anime but it just is ahead of its time and really needs to be done over or at least continued the right way.",1175644800,3,2212,4.129930394431555
2569570,4,B000FJH5JU,"Well again I find myself saying that this is a exceptional anime that I persoally love, but I do say that the way they ended the anime was alittle disapointing. I still recomend buying this but if your left with a gapping hole in you for more then check out the manga (even though its not done yet).

Also just as a side note the 4th battle was different in the manga.",1167523200,,368,4.111111111111111
2569571,5,B000FJH5JU,"Goku and Kenshiro were really cool,

but your way cooler Kei!",1162425600,4,61,4.545454545454546
2569572,4,B000FJH5JU,"In the first season of GANTZ, we get a kind of introductory package that shows us all of the characters in their everyday roles as well as their GANTZ roles. It also presents us with the stark setting and ultra-bloody, unflinching look at violence. This season decides to step up the ol' ultra-violence and puts a whole lot of emotional impact behind the blood and guts, making this a breathtaking and somewhat difficult series to watch. Yet it's so addictive, it's almost impossible not to watch...

Season two presents two of the final battles. I say two because, for a lot of the GANTZ gamers, the final battle just so happens to be the first battle. Kei, Kishimoto, and Kato face a duo of giant statues that appear, at first, to be impossible opponents to defeat. Yet when things seem to start moving in their direction, new opponents present themselves and make the task that much more difficult to complete. This battle also introduces a few more key characters to the story, as well as bringing back some more of the survivors from the previous battle with the bird alien. And finally comes the actual final battle, one in which I will not describe here so as not to ruin any of the surprises that come along the way.

What I will say, however, is the final outcome is too ambiguous to be satisfying, which is why this box set gets a 4 instead of a 5. To add, the story in this season slows down a lot from what it did in the first season.

This box set contains volumes seven through ten, representing the time when ADV decided to release GANTZ in a more consumer friendly format:

Vol. 7 Fatal Attractions

Vol. 8 Deathwatch

Vol. 9 Judge, Jury, and Executioner

Vol. 10 Endgame

No anime series I've seen has been as disturbingly violent and mature as this, especially in this season, as it kind of takes a step in the direction of soft-core porn. Still, that is a brief moment in the story, and also kind of an important part of the storyline, so the not-so-graphic sex scene doesn't feel forced. As a series, though, this is definitely one of the better ones to have been released in the past couple years, and as long as your of age, I highly recommend this box set along with its first season companion.",1149379200,21,2217,4.483870967741935

8123628,5,B000FJH5JU,"This is a good series for older people mostly adults and heres why

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) If you seen the first season then you know what im talking about if you have NOT heres a quick recap, Kai Kurono and Masaru Katou were friends who died but come back to life and now become part of a sick game where people people who recently died come back to life but to return to the normal world they need to kill aliens in a bloody and violent manner.

Pros: Very fast action in some place, NEVER a dull or borning moment in the whole show. You can get deep into characters and their development to feel like you really know them. If you are a blood and guts fan then this show is for you! it is full of blood, guts and shooting. Also there is a minor hentai (aka) sex scene in this season.

Cons: if you HATE blood, guts, violence, nudity then stay away because this show is full of it. People are dieing in horrible bloody manners all the time. People in the show are still evil and only caring about them selves.

Netural note: When I said there is nudity in this show I really mean it. Girls boobs are shown uncensored, also as I said before there is a minor hentai aka sex scene in the show where one of the main characters is having full uncensored sex with a girl for 20 seconds in a hall way. They NEVER show the down stairs privert parts but that dosnt mean they don't show everything else, the motions of sex, the positions, the screaming and everything else you can think of.

Audio: the theme song rocks!

Over All: if you can get past the cons and netural note I left, you will like this series, its good, intresting, BUY IT!!",1406160000,,1654,4.218354430379747
8123629,1,B000FJH5JU,Apparently they thought I hadnt actually seen season 2 or wouldnt be stubborn enough to actually call Amazon and demand a replacement or refund. Well surprise surprise I did both.,1391644800,,179,5.0
8123630,5,B000FJH5JU,Box set came in perfect condition. I'm thankful to finally have this series added to my collection. Thank you a lot.,1366761600,,116,4.571428571428571
8123631,2,B000FJH5JU,"First off, let me say that I love the series and I wanted to own a little piece of it, but buying the anime was a big waste of time. I couldn't even watch the whole thing, the plot(filler), the voices, just, were too much. I'd stick with the manga. But the boxset it's self was very nice, not made out of cheap cardboard like all the others, I do like that about it. I recommend buying it episode by episode before you buy the whole season, to see if you like it first.",1299715200,,469,4.0
8123632,5,B000FJH5JU,"So I love Berserk and was looking for something similar and dark (since dark, graphic and cynical anime is more of my style). I was recommended Gantz and it was right on the money. This anime shows just how diverse human society is and the way people think. Some characters are good, some scumbags, and others fight within themselves between doing what is right or just looking out for themselves. Very realistic. The story is bugged out but in a good way. Finally, the ending is strange but really cool, as opposed to many animes that have strange supposedly ""philosophical"" endings that really are just so ridiculous that the ending ends up killing the series.

Must have for dark/cynical anime fans.",1284163200,,702,4.801652892561983
8123633,4,B000FJH5JU,"now this is a really good anime adaptation of the manga, however, if you are really interested in the show, i suggest you read the manga, whether it be by buying it or online, because the way the show ends (i'm not gonna spoil it) is NOT the way the manga ends, as far as i know the manga is still going, and is alot more exciting. yes it's kind of disappointing finishing the show thinking you have a complete grasp of the series only to realize that it ends differently in the manga but it's nice actually watching the characters come to life. so i say buy it.watch it.then pick up where it left off in the manga.",1268438400,,615,4.176470588235294
8123634,4,B000FJH5JU,"well i have to say that this is a very good anime... a bit slow at times, like some reviewers say... but all in all its a good anime... a bit frustrating also for the simple fact that it is true that the characters do engage in meaningless debates instead of taking action against the aliens sons of bird bi@$%& like its said in an episode lol... the whole series is great but the end is inconclusive as of to what in the world the Gantz is? why is it doing this to them? and where the hell does it go at the end?... these are probably the questions that u will be asking at the end... if you go to wikipedia the character explanation there leaves you even more confused then the anime itself... i don't know if it was the anime or the manga that they tried to explain but i guess if u want some type of answer then read the manga they seem to always be more detailed... but all in all it was a great anime and i really enjoyed it until the last episode... i do recommend it to avid anime watchers... not for ppl that detest gore, violence, sex and not for kids... other than that this is a great series to watch... i have seen many anime and the drawing and animation is great and colorful... i recommend to get the anime its worth a watch...",1263427200,,1243,4.098360655737705
8123635,1,B000FJH5JU,"I'm gonna have to give this the lowest rating.
Maybe because I read Gantz comicbook first, maybe because it stretched what's worth 2 comicbooks into a 6-DVD series.

Excuse my English, I'll try to do my best.
Story line is 99% same as the book. nothing new or indepth story line. Some of the still shots are exactly the same as the manga.
But it contains so much empty stares and still moments (reminds me of Dragon Ball series) it is really annoying. Even the characters movement sometimes is unrealistically slow (ie, standing up from a chair or reaching for something)
When it ""finally"" gets to action sequences, movements gets little better, but not much. And again, empty stares while groaning and yelling, (charaters just stands there and groans and  makes mean faces when they should move on to the next sequence) It really cuts the flow of the movie and makes me yell ""What the fvck are they doing!!!!!""
Like I said before, 2 books worth of storyline stretched into freaking SIX DVDs..

Next complaint is the Illustration Quality.  It just SUCKS. Not much effort went into the drawing of this animation.
Characters sometimes appear cross-eyed and out of proportion. Their shapes constantly change.  Eventhough some CG's were used for background, they aren't that good. This animation reminds me of poorly funded TV anime series from 90's.

Oh, by the way, Comicbook Season 1 (which is known as Phase 1) does not correspond with Animation Season 1.  Animation Season 1 and 2 contains about 2/3 of the Phase 1 storyline.  Again, not much effot went into this anime.  or the producer decided not to spent much effort on this project.  I guess they figured that the name ""Gantz"" was enough to return the revenue.

For such an amazingly original manga, this anime was a huge disapointment.  If Evangelion scored 8/10 in my book, Gantz would score 3/10.",1253577600,,1855,4.79874213836478
8123636,1,B000FJH5JU,"Let me start by saying I have not even finished this anime, nor will I.  I stopped around episode 16, with the giant statues.  I also won't go into further detail on plot because I do not want to give anything away to those poor souls who are actually looking forward to this garbage.
I heard great things about this series in my scouting of new shows to watch so I decided to give this one a shot.  Boy was I wrong to even consider this.  It's not the asinine plot that goes nowhere episode after episode that disappoints me.  Or the ""state of the art"" animation which blends CG and hand drawn about as well as scat and ice cream.  Its the ridiculously slow pacing.
In some cases, the character spend half the episode (no joke) debating whether or not to shoot an alien that is threating their lives.  In the show, the characters are granted these amazing weapons that appear to have unlimited ammo, no recoil, really no faults.  So what do our awesome heroes do?  Nothing.  Thats right, nothing!  The creators are obviously trying to build suspense, but ultimately fail and, instead, create a very boring and uninteresting cartoon.
Despite what most say, the animation is horrible.  The CG is primarily used for scrolling backgrounds when the characters run.  Its more of a lazy trick than an actual attempt to do something worthwhile.
If you have morals or a weak stomach (both of which I lack) than steer clear of this train wreck regardless.  It has everything from rape, to gory deaths, to very questionable ethics.  If these things disturb you, don't say I did not warn you.  It doesn't bother more so than infuriate me with the way they use these shock tools.  An example is the main character.  All he thinks about is getting laid.  Its entertaining once or twice to throw that in there.  Its funny!  But the protagonist literally eats sleeps and breaths this obsession.  Its sad to watch.  No one, I mean no one acts like that.  Nice try to spice it up team Gantz.  I'm not buying it.
Speaking of which, neither should you.  I give this the lowest rating I have ever given anything.  At least the opening song is catchy...",1208217600,3,2132,4.52755905511811
