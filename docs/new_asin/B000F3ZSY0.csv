8117260,5,B000F3ZSY0,"To die at the age of 55 is a tragedy for anyone.  For Terry to have died at that age is not only a tragedy, but a great loss for the martial arts community.  This class, videotaped on 1990, just two years before his death, shows how wide-ranging Terry's skills were and how much he hoped for and expected from his students.  This DVD, remastered from the original VHS tape, is far from perfect in its technical aspects, but it does give an excellent view of Terry.  I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the broader issues of martial arts.",1285718400,3,552,4.330097087378641
8117261,4,B000F3ZSY0,"I consider that this video is very good for advance people that wanted to go deep onto aikido`s path, but may be not so usefull for beginers because is not really basic, it is about ki, and mind, also technics but from this points of view that is also difficult for senior students. So is great material from a person that was a direct student of o`sensei Ueshiba, and also one of the few westerns that practice under the master, that makes unic the video. I wish this can help your desition of choosing this DVD.",1186531200,6,513,4.354166666666667
