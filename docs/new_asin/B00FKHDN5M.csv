8616328,2,B00FKHDN5M,The quality is so bad that it's nigh unwatchable. I only gave it two stars because it did excite my daughter's interest.,1412726400,,120,4.5
8616329,2,B00FKHDN5M,The quality of this video is not good.  It's kind of blurry and it's boring.  I was hoping it was more like a song CD rather than a DVD with fuzzy dull characters.,1409788800,,163,3.909090909090909
8616330,1,B00FKHDN5M,I was really excited to find these as a gift for a friends 3 year old. I learned the video quality is very poor. I viewed the dvd on various devices and all still look distorted. Inexcusable.,1402185600,,191,4.1891891891891895
8616331,5,B00FKHDN5M,My son absolutely LOOOVES this dvd!!! I remember the letter people when i was in kindergarden (25yrs ago) and was so happy to hear my son has the letter people in his class all these yrs later. Awesome way to learn the abc's and sounds each letter makes. Very pleased :),1384387200,3,270,4.313725490196078
