2875741,1,B000RW3YVI,"I purchased this video hoping for a believable, moving version of the life of this beloved saint. What my family and I encountered was a poorly done movie, with very little attention to detail, and obviously cheap in its production. This was so obvious that we were moved to laughter, for example, when we noticed that one of the leading characters always wears the same red costume
and never ages, even when, according to the plot, 30 or so years went on since the first moment of her appearance. The acting was equally dismal. This film may be good to entertain children, but not for adults that seek some level of inspiration through a video version of the life of a great human being as San Martin de Porres was. This film dishonors his legacy and memory.",1220659200,6,759,4.547445255474453

2875743,1,B000RW3YVI,"Contrario a los comentarios anteriores, esta pelicula es bastante mala, actores fingidos y dialogos rebuscados. Fray martin aparece aqui casi como hechicero, brujo, agitando un manojo de hierbas a los enfermos. la ridicula voz que le ponen a los a animales es otro punto que mas que risa, me da trsiteza. Nada que hacer con la hermosa y llena de contenido pelicula ""Fray Escoba""",1210896000,2,378,4.921875

2875745,5,B000RW3YVI,"For all Christians and those who BELIEVE - A MUST SEE MOVIE!!  At times we may complain about our own sacrifices and pain when in reality we forget why perserverance and patience is so important in life.  Fray Martin de Porres is a movie of TRUE LOVE FOR GOD, true sacrifice and perserverance which evidently gives TRUE HOPE IN GOD.  Treat your heart, soul and mind to this beautiful food of love, devotion and sacrifice - your faith can only increase.",1199664000,15,452,4.555555555555555

8202667,4,B000RW3YVI,"Fray Martin de Porres is an inspirational story about a miracle worker who rises above the evils of discrimination and heals thousands.

Martin de Porres was a lay brother of the Dominican Order who was beatified in 1837 by Pope Gregory XVI and canonized in 1962 by Pope John XXIII. He is the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony. He was noted for work on behalf of the poor, establishing an orphanage and a children's hospital. He maintained an austere lifestyle, which included fasting and abstaining from meat. Among the many miracles attributed to him were those of levitation, bilocation, miraculous knowledge, instantaneous cures, and an ability to communicate with animals. It was directed by Raymundo Calixto Sanchez.

This was a very authentic, well acted movie on the life of St. Martin de Porres. Even though it was in Spanish with English subtitles, the acting was done so well that you easily understood what was going on without the subtitles. It is a great portrayal of a famous saint.",1417910400,,1039,4.9655172413793105

8202669,5,B000RW3YVI,These videos meet with my expectations. It's all about the love of our Catholic faith and these individuals who have set an example for us to follow in order to gain the highest possible merit in heaven,1389916800,,202,4.486486486486487

Neither of the two films above have any indication of the Region suitable for viewing.
Can anyone tell me if these two films are suitable for REGION 2  (Europe) please?

8202671,5,B000RW3YVI,"A beautiful portrayal of a favorite saint. His deep humility shines through every scene. The movie brings out his love of animals, especially the mice and rats that overran the monastery. I will watch it again and again.",1225843200,3,220,4.815789473684211
8202672,3,B000RW3YVI,"This movie is excellent in portraying Saint Martin de Porres as a holy and pious man who had great gifts and graces from God.  It portrays the racism of the era, but also shows that much of the white population of Peru were not racist at all and treated Martin quite well. It is also very cute in showing Saint Martin's love of everything, even poor lowly animals (which is a true part of his biography). It is an interesting movie to watch, but it plays more like a made for TV drama that drags at some points, but that is not too annoying.  What is annoying is its gross inaccuracies which shows that the director of the film has very poor knowledge of Catholicism.

The movie shows Martin de Porres being recognized by his superiors and despite the racial laws of Peru, he is ordained a priest.  First of all, Saint Martin de Porres was never ordained a priest, but was only a lay brother.  Second, a priest can only be ordained by a Bishop, not by a priest like it is portrayed in the movie.  Third, even a Saint cannot be just ordained a priest without going through seminary studies, and Martin is spontaneously ordained in the movie.  Finally, Martin's superiors announce to him in the movie that he can now take the 3 vows (chastity, poverty, obedience) and then make it seem like it is the same as ordination to the priesthood, which it is not.  Saint Martin did indeed take these vows, but he was never a priest.

I would not show this movie to children, non-Catholics, or poorly cathechized Catholics, as it may confuse them too much.",1225843200,5,1545,4.450354609929078
