7011069,5,B00TJF3Q9O,"Seen Mr. Vai on this tour back in 2013 in Knoxville, TN and it was absolutely incredible. It was lacking Beverly and the chick that played the harp because of personal matters they had to address, but none the less an amazing show. It was me second Vai concert with the first being in Asheville in 2005 on the Real Illusions tour. Such an incredible musician and all around kind and wonderful man. I'm sure this release will not disappoint..hell it's Steve Via!! So it cannot disappoint",1425859200,4,486,4.597701149425287
7011070,5,B00TJF3Q9O,"I saw Vai in Chicago at House of Blues on this tour.  It was one of the best concerts Ive ever been to.  Also I'm pretty sure this show was televised live on axis TV. Anyway,  Steve Vai and his band are incredibly gifted musicians,  check this out and see for yourself.",1425686400,7,269,4.115384615384615
7011071,5,B00TJF3Q9O,A big heads up to everyone disappointed with the the DVD resolution as there is a HD version on Amazon video! The quality is as good or better then that of the last Vai blu ray release and has all the bonus features! Some of you sound so bummed out that I had to say something...if your a music fan and guitar guy like me we know and share the love of a live freakin Steve Vai show!!!,1454025600,2,384,3.9358974358974357

C'mon... It's awesome. Total epicness. Go and purchase this. Now.

[ATTENTION: If you care about this stuff even though this isn't Star Wars movie or similar, it's good for you to know before your purchase - these DVDs are NOT HD, video is in standard DVD resolution and it only has 2 channel stereo audio, no 5.1 and no additional audio tracks like commentaries - you have simple menu with 3 options - PLAY - CHAPTERS - CREDITS, and that's it. I personally like this experience, it reminds me of good old days when I was younger and in love with every move that Vai made - there was no BAD QUALITY VIDEO when it came to master himself - I breathe it all - and it showed me I still am in love with everything related to him - I saw this show live in 2012 and to see these amazing people bring it ON on stage again - perfect. Focus on music and on overall experience, don't be spoiled by pixel number these days, there are plenty on this DVD, more then enough to feel the vibe and to be happy you own this piece of art and that you can watch it over and over again.

In attachment you can check out the unboxed package, screenshot and video sample taken through VLC player and FVC converter on my laptop, no image enhancement and scaling.

""...and remember, LIFE IS GOOD..."" ;)",1453420800,4,1949,5.191082802547771
7011075,5,B00TJF3Q9O,"Great show, great picture and exceptional sound quality as usual from Vai.",1451692800,,74,5.25
7011076,5,B00TJF3Q9O,"At the end of this recorded L.A. show, Vai stays on stage for a short last goodbye for the public he so much loves. His last words are ...remember, life's good!"" (end of the track ""Warm Signs"" from the Fire Garden album).
This whole show is a living proof of the love Vai has shared -and still shares- with us for so many years. To complain so angrily about this show not being released in Blu-ray is being harsh and utterly unfair, to say the least. Vai produces the show, so I guess he was okay with the decision not to release this on Blu-ray. And I am totally okay with it. I watched it on my big screen and stereo system, and the sound is excellent, and the image is more than fine ... (you know ... life's good!). Bear in mind there are a couple of extra hours of extra footage of backstage material (some of it with actual real bad sound -it is credited as such), but at the same time priceless material to help us fans grasp what goes on in putting a show together. You get to see almost everything there is to a show from the point of view of someone who is touring with the crew all over the world (there are birthdays, eating, sleeping, gooding around, and rehearsing, including rehearsing with an orchestra for his composition he did for Netherlands. There are also a lot of personal appeareances of Vai with his wife, etc. etc.) This is much appreciated, and it helps me greatly give this DVD a 5 stars rating.
About the musical show per se, there are moments for everyone. I was absolutely mesmerized by the moment Vai dedicates to bring someone up on stage and creating a new song. That is just mind blowing! I did not like other moments that much (for example the interlude with the mini circus-drums), but that was just me and I still do get the point. The drummer is a killer, by the way, and so are the bass player and the accompanying rhythm guitar player. Not a fan or the harp, but it's fine, it's a Vai show, so it has to be unique, and it is! Oh ... and this is filmed in a small venue, so it's got this aura that is so hard to accomplish in most venues nowadays (as a matter of fact, I do not attend rock shows anymore because of that. I wished they would all take place in venues with maximum 3,000 people, and everybody would have a seat so we all can see what is going on on stage...).
Vai is an Artist, not only a virtuoso guitar player, not only a songwriter ... I appreciate the effort he puts in the stage movements, the dresses he uses, the sounds he crafts from his guitar, his dancing with the guitar, etc. I really think he is someone with great gusto ... Not easy to accomplish without falling into the clich&eacute;. And he is not, he surpasses anybody's expectation by continuously raising the bar.
Other reviewers have pointed out this is a rare chance for fans to get to own a live show, and I'd have to agree with them. Get this while it is available. And for fifteen dollars, I say this is a steal!
Life's good!",1448496000,,2954,4.24866785079929
7011077,3,B00TJF3Q9O,"One of the DVD's is a great compilation of pictures in video format. However, in 2015 I do not expect to see pictures in DVD resolution.

I loved all the behind  the  scenes . Steve genuinely cares for  his fans. So gracious and kind which I happen to know  about  first hand. I was on stage with him in Baton Rouge  attempting to sing his guitar  part. Talk about the dream of  a lifetime!  Can't  wait till hear  what he comes up with next!

The Harp player and the overall show put together is fantastic, believe me. I highly recommend this DVD, there are no enough words to describe the emotion and the virtuousness of Vai and his band mates.",1433980800,,387,4.6231884057971016

7011096,4,B00TJF3Q9O,"You will notice everyone else complain about the same thing. Video quality ;-/  Yes it is better than your old
VHS  tape but why it was not filmed in HD or processed properly is beyond me. An iPhone can shoot video
sharper than this! When you are filming a Guitar God and at the level of perfection contained here, it should
have been done in full 1080 HD.  But hey, I'll take what I can get from Steve.",1431388800,5,403,4.141025641025641

7011101,5,B00TJF3Q9O,"I'm not a huge Vai fan, but I respect his skill, enthusiasm, showmanship, and generosity toward his fans and the guitar community.  This show is a fine example of Vai and his band doing what they do best.  The on-the-road documentary is enjoyable and delivers a genuine feeling of being along for the ride.  Overall, Stillness in Motion is an entertaining package that I'd recommend to any guitarist or music lover.",1430697600,,415,4.816901408450704
7011102,5,B00TJF3Q9O,I've been listening to Steve Vai ever since he came onboard the Zappa Ship. This DVD take have the same playlist as his latest concert in Gothenburg Sweden.

Opened the door to see that the corner of the package was damaged. I saw that it was not my regular driver and asked if he needed to to sign anything. He just said nope and drove off! The dvd case was cracked on the corner when I opened it but the dvds were okay. Other than the ups  guy who was not the regular guy the dvd is worth the money!",1430524800,,490,3.803921568627451
7011104,2,B00TJF3Q9O,"I'm pretty indifferent about this release; I've liked Vai since I was in middle school, so I'll buy anything he puts out just because he was such an influential musician to me when I was younger...but this release is garbage in my opinion due to the highly compressed looking video quality and what I feel is a poorly mixed 2 channel audio track.",1430438400,2,346,4.507936507936508

7011110,4,B00TJF3Q9O,"Steve Vai is certainly one of the most creative virtuoso musicians in the world and Stillness In Motion is his great new DVD documenting his world tour for his amazing last album The Story Of Light. Joining him for this tour was Jeremy Colson on drums, Philip Bynoe on bass, Dave Weiner on guitar, and Debora Henson-Conant on electric harp. The DVD contains two discs with the main concert split over both discs and a very comprehensive tour diary featuring lots of behind the scenes footage of the band travelling around the world. The set list contains lots of Steve Vai classics including ""Building The Church"", ""Animal"", and ""For The Love Of God"", along with songs from The Story Of Light including ""Velorum"", ""Gravity Storm"", and the vocal track ""The Moon and I"". A great part of the concert is where audience members come onstage to inspire the band to write a new original song on the spot! It goes without saying that Steve Vai is always going to deliver an awesome performance surrounded by other amazing musicians whilst throwing in interesting twists like adding electric harp and some Vai-based humour. Whilst many reviewers have complained about the lack of high definition sound and vision that the DVD offers, it will certainly not disappoint fans who may have missed out on seeing this world tour. I was lucky enough to watch this band nail these songs live in Sydney and this concert DVD is a great document of the tour along with extensive bonus footage. A true musician and artist such as Steve Vai deserves all the success he has achieved and I am always looking forward to a new studio album from this unique virtuoso and his band - 4.5 stars.",1428624000,2,1664,4.7020547945205475
7011111,3,B00TJF3Q9O,"Steve Vai is one of the greatest guitar players to ever pick up the instrument and a huge inspiration to me as a guitar player..  I saw this tour in Chicago at the House of Blues and I have been waiting for over 2 years for this concert video to come out.  I was so excited when Steve announced it was ready.  I pre-ordered it and when it showed up yesterday I was so disappointed.  On my 55"" tv the DVD looks so blocky. It might look fine on a 27"" tv, but not a modern sized tv.  Where is the Blu-Ray?!?!  We can record HD video on a three year old cell phone, but we can't see the best guitar player on the planet in HD?  That is a shame. I am sorry Steve.  If I didn't care so much about it, I would not be so disappointed.  Please push for a release on Blu-Ray!  I would pay $40 for this on Blu-Ray and sit back with a huge smile on my face.",1428624000,16,845,3.8045977011494254
7011112,5,B00TJF3Q9O,"Steve does it again, shows us he's still at the top of his game, and gives us an incredible live show!!!

7011113,1,B00TJF3Q9O,"I was disappointed with the release of Where the Wild Things Are because it was only 720p, not 1080p and had no HD audio, just old legacy Dolby Digital but I bought it. This time though, no Blu-ray then no buy for me. I'm a huge Vai fan and his live performances deserve both HD video and HD audio and I'm sure his performance this time is top notch as usual and would be deserving of 5 stars but the release is only worthy of 1. Steve should be following Joe Satriani, for example Joe's Saturated: Live in Montreal had 7.1 Dolby TrueHD and not that we needed it but it was also in 3D",1428537600,5,584,4.086956521739131

Color me disappointed as previous releases Where The Wild Things Are (Blu Ray/mulitchannel) and Visual Sound Theories (DVD/multichannel) are top quality.  This release is a 2-channel mix only, it's a damn shame as I was looking forward to being surrounded by Vai in my home theater.  If you can live with 2-channel only, then go for it.

I just bought a Bluray of the tribute band Australian Pink Floyd.......Hey SONY........does Steve Vai not deserve a top flight Bluray release that even tribute bands are getting??? Vai is arguably the best guitar player in the world.......yet another reason for me to loathe Sony....I have despised their products for quite some time now. Denying Steve a Bluray release is a debacle and insulting to say the least. I hate to buy this inferior media, but I respect and like SV so much that I will. Like a previous user said.....ZERO STARS FOR SONY

5 Stars for VAI......!!!!!!

7011117,5,B00TJF3Q9O,"Vai recently confirmed in a FB post that Sony has made the decision NOT to release this on Blu Ray. That means for now at least we all get DVD quality video and audio. Vai has put out some of the best sounding engineered releases out there. To not release this in a Hi Rez format is insanely stupid. Really bad move on Vai's part. Screw Sony. Release the thing yourself Steve! I will not buy this if there is no Blu Ray version. I refuse to take a step back 20 years in quality. This thing was recorded almost 3 years ago. Plenty of time to get it done.
