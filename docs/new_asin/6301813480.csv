As a Hulk fan I consider this film not as a masterpiece but as a good action movie. I wouldn't have written the story this way.
This episode has (almost) nothing to do with the Tv series from the seventies anymore. Only Hulk Lovers will like this.",1014336000,2,363,4.27536231884058
368853,3,6301813480,"When you play this DVD you will find that the title is in fact, The Incredible Hulk Returns, not the Return of the Incredible Hulk.  It was a made for TV movie.  Bill Bixby is David Banner as he was in the TV series.  This story also introduces Thor, the Thunder God, and his earthly counterpart, but the introduction was badly written.  Breaking into Dr Banner's lab just as he is about to cure himself from turning into the Hulk and stopping the machines just to tell Dr Banner about how he is able to summon Thor doesn't make sense.  There are no extras on this bargain basement DVD, and my copy had some glitches in the encoding when it tried to play the closing credits.  This DVD is mainly for the fans of the TV series as it doesn't have much else going for it.",1012521600,4,768,4.226027397260274
368906,5,6301813480,The return of the Incredible Hulk and the trial of The Incredible Hulk. The return of the Incredible Hulk came on TV in 1988 how was in 11th grade at the time and I remember Thor being on this so I had to buy this and I was glad I did they were trying to get on a spin off TV show with this movie but it didn't work. The movie was still good the idea of the Hulk teammates with Thor was really cool. The trial of The Incredible Hulk in this one they are putting the Incredible Hulk with Daredevil as I was trying to give Daredevil a spin off TV show. This movie came out in 1989 on television. I really love these two movies because it shows Marvel once again was trying to get their superheroes on TV and not just Saturday mornings but in live action shows. Two great movies on one DVD you can't go wrong period plus Lou Ferrigno was bigger in these two movies that he was on a TV show his muscles were huge in these two movies.,1491091200,,929,3.9732620320855614

If I had to compare the series to this, I would say the series on TV was better. The movie became more like the cartoon.  The TV series and Bill Bixby's great acting had you feeling his character's pain as he struggled for a cure.

He is still performing in plays across the USA and in-between does club tours, singing and telling stories about life on the road called Confessions of a Former Teen Idol.
This isn't the first time for the Hulk.  Rick Springfield and Gerald McRaney guest-starred in an episode in the series that was supposed to be a spin-off, but Rick got General Hospital and Jessie's Girl and Gerald got Simon and Simon.  The eps that were filmed were never shown.

You will come to find yourself cheering the Hulk on as he saves people countless times, and you will find yourself hating Jack McGee for not leaving him alone to live his life.

369123,4,6301813480,"This double feature gives fans Hulk vs Thor, plus Hulk and Thor vs terrorists.  Then gives Daredevil and Hulk vs the Kingpin and his organization.

""Return"" turns Thor into a Viking Warrior condemned to never enter Valhala until he'd performed a number of Heroic deeds.  Thor remained disembodied until called.  Then he appeared, flesh and blood.  Possessing combat skills beyond modern understanding and a mystic hammer.  Thor's guide knew Banner before he became the Hulk.

""Trial"" substituted Daredevil's ""Devil"" costume for a Black Ninja costume.  Matt Murdock's senses and training seem to be the same as always.  Murdock became Banner's lawyer after banner stumbled into Kingpin's world.

369125,5,6301813480,I love Bill Bixby and this show in particular.  These movies are part of a three part set of movies.  I only wish they put all three together in one set instead of making us buy two different packages to get all three.

369126,3,6301813480,"My review and thoughts are based on the fact that I own the Anchor Bay release of these films (which came out in 2003).

The reason I am giving this a 3 star rating is due to the lack of bonus material.  Now I am a huge fan of The Incredible Hulk, and loved the series as a kid.  These movies are made-for-TV, and a far cry from the 2000s version of The Incredible Hulk (which I found abysmal).  So the budget was that of a TV series, and not of a major studio.  So some of the stuff (especially with The Trial that stars DareDevil) is pretty cheesy (mainly the dialog).  I do love that the great John Rhys-Davies plays Mr. Fisk.  That was pretty epic (loved him as Sallah in Raiders, and Last Crusade).

Bill Bixby was such a fantastic actor (taken from us far too soon) in the role of David Banner (yes they changed the name to David from Bruce for the TV series.  You'll have to research as to the reason why they did that, and it is kinda stupid as to the reason).  Now if you have never watched the TV series (at a minimum watch the original pilot) it might feel a bit weird seeing these first.  The thing with Bill was that he was David Banner.  He embodied the character, and to me his acting was top notch (watch My Favorite Martian to see him as a comedian).

One thing you have to realize is that the pacing of these films is much slower than what is out these days.  As I said these were NOT big budget films, and due to that fact you will see that things were a bit on the cheap (especially with the FX).  Also Lou's version of the Hulk is more realistic (and to me more ""human"" compared to the cartoony version they did in the 2000s (where that was more like the comics).  The quest to cure himself (he meaning David) is at the center of the first film as it should be.  You can tell it is VERY 80s by the electronic score they created.

The second film is a left turn from the last and has David caught in the middle of something very sinister.  I was not all that impressed with Rex Harrison's portrayal of DareDevil.  The back story of the character is cool, but I just don't think he was the right fit.  They hired him because Rex was a very in-demand actor at the time.  Again John Rhys-Davies portrays Mr. Fisk, and in some areas he really shines, but in others the writers I feel let him down.

Understand that I am not giving a lot away from the stories because I want you to experience them for yourselves.  They are NOT a waste of money.  They are part of the lore of this character, and are still fun to watch if you are or were a fan of the original TV series.

Again.  I will point out that I own the Anchor Bay version of this double feature which DOES contain bonus material.  So if you can find that version (which might be harder and cost a lot more since it is out of print) you get the exact same movies, but you get bonus goodies.  It's the one I would recommend.  It is very sad that this 2011 release has absolutely nothing for bonus material.

This is what Anchor Bay release included:

Disc One:

Muscling In On Movies: An all new Interview with Lou Ferrigno
The Marvelous World of Stan Lee: All new interview with Stan Lee
Poster and Still Gallery
Talent Bios

Disc Two:

Stand Tall: 84 minute documentary of Lou Ferrigno (this was when he got back into body building to compete in Mr. Universe.  It also has some narrative with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and gives you an insight into the Mr. Universe body building world).
Poster and Still Gallery
Talent Bios

Finally I would strongly recommend getting a copy of The Death of the Incredible Hulk.  That rounds out Bill's version of the Incredible Hulk (and capped off the show as a whole), and despite it being made-for-TV there are some very wonderful moments (very sad in places too).  Also there is a copy of the pilot of the original series which came with an extra episode about David getting married (if you don't want to invest in the complete series), and you should watch that first to fully understand these movies.  This is the only series/movie that you can watch the pilot, jump into these films, and fully understand what is going on without having to watch every episode.",1413072000,,4173,4.2729591836734695

The Incredible Hulk Returns was good entertainment. We got to see Thor, another Marvel Superhero team up with Hulk. Many of us had hoped Thor would become a new TV series.

The Trial of the Incredible Hulk was good also. Daredevil (Matt Murdock) appeared in the movie. Matt Murdock was the Hulk's attorney. I hated this version of Daredevil. He's nothing like the Marvel comics version. I didn't like this movie as much as ""Hulk Returns.""",1384128000,,700,4.592
369282,5,6301813480,"After The Incredible Hulk was cancelled by CBS in 1982, everyone thought they'd seen the last of The Incredible Hulk but that was not to be. In 1988, NBC resurrected The Incredible Hulk for 3 made for tv movies all directed by Bill Bixby himself! The first of these 3 tv movies was The Incredible Hulk Returns

The Incredible Hulk Returns: David Banner has been seemingly living the semi-good life. It's been 2 years since he's transformed into the Hulk, he's living with his beautiful girlfriend and co-worker, biogeneticist Dr. Maggie Shaw. Banner (under the name David Banyon) works with Maggie at the Joshua Lambert Institute  and he's very close to ridding himself of the Hulk with a new Gamma Transponder he recently, personally built. However, his life is suddenly thrown back into chaos when a former colleague, Donald Blake, comes to David with his own ""problem"".  Blake has been magically bonded with the Norse warrior deity The Mighty Thor after unearthing him during a mountain hike in Norway . To make matters worse, a group of murderous Cajun criminals have been hired by Josh Lambert's son, Zack to steal the Transponder. When the crooks find that Banner has been hanging around the Transponder more than they want him to, he becomes a target on their hit list and kidnap Banner's girlfriend and hold her at ransom. From that point on, Hulk and Thor must put their differences aside to track down the crooks, and save Maggie and the Gamma Transponder.

Sidenotes: A few things I want to point out is that this movie is all action! Constant action and drama left and right that is bound to leave everyone hanging on the edge of their seat the first time watching the movie.

- The stylish wig used for Hulk in the late 70s and early 80s were replaced with an ugly mullet wig for Hulk to get with the mid-late 80s style and culture. Unfortunately, the wig looks pretty horrendous on Lou and am surprised they couldn't have found a better mullet wig for him.

- The Incredible Hulk Returns was a set up to begin a TV series featuring Thor but it never came to fruition.

- This film was written and directed by Nicholas Corea who wrote a lot of the show's greatest episodes throughout the series. This was his last affiliation with the Hulk series before Gerald Dipego began writing the final 2 Hulk movies

- The Incredible Hulk Returns was also the last time viewers witnessed Jack McGee in pursuit of the Hulk, which was sad, considering McGee helped carry the show. So I guess you could say that McGee ultimately retires from pursuing The Hulk after this movie.

- This was a completely new era of the Hulk. New producers, new music composer, etc.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Trial of The Incredible Hulk: The film begins with Banner, under the name David Belson, moving into a big city and renting an apartment room. The big city is corrupted by evil crime boss, Wilson Fisk aka Kingpin. David Banner is now being portrayed as a rather broken and bitter man, who's given up on himself and life and wants to ""stay buried"". However, fate refuses to leave Banner alone and it's only a matter of time before he's caught in the middle of yet another altercation. This time while on a subway, Banner attempts to stop 2 thugs (who happen to work for Wilson Fisk) from sexually assaulting a woman, Ellie Mendez and pays the price for it. This leads to The Hulk showing up and tossing around the 2 baddies like neighborhood garbage. The Hulk gets more aggressive in this movie, as one of the thugs is taken down with a clothesline. Banner is found by police shortly thereafter and taken to jail and accused of the sexual assault as well as the death of a man who was accidentally shot during the altercation. His lawyer just happens to be Matt Murdock, who unbeknownst to David is secretly trying to tear down Wilson Fisk and his tower as night hero, Daredevil! While in jail, Ellie is in the hospital, healing from the assault on the train. She's eventually kidnapped by Fisk's henchmen and taken hostage to his tower. The anxiety of standing trial takes its toll on David who Hulks out and breaks out of jail. Murdock tracks down and convinces a reluctant Banner to join forces with him to bring down Wilson Fisk's tower. After hearing Matt's story on how he went blind, David agrees to join him save Ellie for Matt, himself, and everyone else he owes it to. While Banner and Murdock form a brother bond due to their mutual conditions, Hulk and Daredevil team up to confront Fisk, rescue Ellie from his tower, and take the first steps in tearing down his powerful criminal organization.

Sidenotes:

- For the first time since the season 1 Death In The Family episode, Banner is sporting a beard, yet when he Hulks out, the Hulk has no beard.

- They gave Lou a shorter version of wig he wore in the previous Hulk film. Unfortunately it still looks bad.

- While this movie is called The Trial of The Incredible Hulk, Banner/Hulk never stands trial except for in a dream Banner has where he Hulks out before the entire courtroom and goes on a rampage.

- Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the movie during Banner's courtroom dream sequence

- Speaking of the Hulk, I want to go back to mentioning how aggressive he was in this movie. In the tv show episodes, Hulk never did more than toss his foes around BUT not anymore! In this film particularly, Hulk goes all out! As I mentioned, he clotheslined one of the thugs on the subway then in the dream Banner has, Hulk slams the bailiff through a table, knocks another one out of a high window, and proceeds to choke an attorney to death. There was also a fight scene where Hulk knocked someone out with a right hand! No lies! Must be seen to be believed! This was perhaps the most violent, Banner's alter ego ever was in the history of the show!

- Viewers were robbed of a final Hulk-Out when Daredevil and Banner infiltrated Kingpin's Tower to battle Fisk and his cronies.

- Similar to how The Incredible Hulk Returns was supposed to be a kick-start for a Thor tv series, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk was supposed to lead to a tv series for Daredevil, but that also never happened

Nonetheless, it's a great movie with tons of action, drama, and even a few violent scenes! Sure it may be cheesy in many aspects, but most low budget movies in the 80s were cheesy. The Trial of The Incredible Hulk also had perhaps the best music score from Lance Rubin out of all 3 films.

Overall: Both of these movies were great in their own way! I prefer Return over Trial as there's more exciting action while Trial tends to drag at certain times. It saddens me to know that scores were never released for any of the 3 films, as composer Lance Rubin adds such a feel-good, can't have enough score sheet to the 3 Hulk films. And last but not least, I recommend you buy the 2 disc Anchor Bay versions of this set. You get a lot of cool extras such as 2 awesome documentaries on both discs, a still gallery, talent biographies, and a mini-booklet in comic book form that's your personal guide to both films",1383264000,,7155,4.61369000786782

369401,3,6301813480,"After a five-year absence, Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno in 1988 resurrected their most famous TV personas as Dr. David Banner and his monstrous alter ego, the Incredible Hulk in the fun reunion flick, ""The Incredible Hulk Returns.""  It is first established that Banner has kept his cool and not ""hulked"" out in two years while re-inventing himself as a research scientist, David Bannion, working on the illustrious Lambert Institute's Gamma Transponder in some unidentified coastal city.  Utilizing the potent Transponder, it appears that Banner may at last free himself from the curse of the Hulk.

Enter an unwanted visit from Banner's former student: Dr. Donald Blake, who has his own superhuman ego problem, as he is now the unlikely possessor of an ancient, enchanted war hammer that channels the arrogant Norse warrior, Thor.  Like any standard TV series concept, a repentant Thor must complete an unspecific number of good deeds to make up for his arrogance in order to gain access to otherworldly Valhalla, with meekly physician Donald Blake as his handler.  This first-ever, live-action Thor is simply a brawny, not-so-bright warrior with a magic hammer  - make no mistake: he is not the God of Thunder here, but he still answers to the unseen Odin.  Eric Kramer's amusing interpretation is almost a precursor to the de-powered Thor that Chris Hemsworth portrays in much of Thor's 2011 feature film.

Meanwhile, local thugs are scheming with a Lambert Institute insider to steal the Gamma Transponder (presumably, to sell to the highest black market bidder).  Of course, it is up to the reluctant David and his new allies to rescue kidnapped love interest, Dr. Maggie Shaw, and still keep nosy tabloid reporter Jack McGee at bay.  This film co-stars Jack Colvin as Jack McGee (in his final appearance); Lee Purcell as Maggie; Steve Levitt as geeky Donald; Eric Kramer as the not exactly Mighty Thor; as well as old pros Charles Napier and Tim Thomerson as the stock Cajun mercenary villains.

Overall, the film is simply entertaining, despite numerous TV cliches and budget constraints (i.e. the cheesy special effects and minimal footage of the Hulk's transformation) for repeated viewings for the age 10 & up crowd.  This movie is clearly geared more for children, as the intelligent TV series' poignancy and dramatic ""Fugitive""-like tone are no longer part of the formula.  Intended as an obvious back-door pilot for a proposed Thor series, the film doesn't generate much interest in the hammer-wielding guest star.  Instead, per the film's title, it ultimately succeeds in re-introducing Ferrigno's Hulk to a new generation.  Sadly, the poorly acted, campy reaction shots of Lambert Institute employees witnessing the Hulk are unintentionally hilarious.  One can only wonder how different or better this movie would have been if TV series creator Kenneth Johnson had actually participated.

The sequel, with Rex Smith as blind defense attorney Matt Murdock / Daredevil and John Rhys-Davies as crime lord Wilson Fisk, carries a potentially better story, but it is not as re-watchable as the ""Returns"" installment.  In this 1989 flick, reclusive and now-bearded David Banner is falsely arrested for attacking a mysterious woman (Marta DuBois) on the subway unaware of her underworld connections to crime boss Wilson Fisk (who isn't acknowledged as ""the Kingpin"").  As the fearless, nocturnal acrobat in the black bodysuit and as Banner's legal counsel, Rex Smith offers a passable performance in his dual role.  At least, Daredevil's portrayal comes closer to the comic book character than Thor did.

The main problem is that, like last time, far more emphasis is given to the guest star hero (again, a back-door pilot) than to co-star Ferrigno.  Inexplicably, Ferrigno is reduced to only a few scenes and not even an appearance in the climax of his own character's movie.

A few side notes: 1. The violence quota is still cartoonish, but the Hulk is surprisingly vicious with innocent court personnel in the ""trial"" dream sequence.  2. There isn't really a trial in this film (except for the dream), which makes the film's title deceptive.  3. Couldn't director-producer Bixby have at least considered the dramatically poignant possibilities of Banner's secret life finally being exposed to the public during a trial re: the bogus murder charge Banner fled from in the series' pilot episode?  Then again, without Kenneth Johnson's involvement, I imagine that is why this movie chose the Daredevil storyline.  4.  There is an amusing gaffe, as the Hulk doesn't retain Banner's beard during the dream sequence.  5. Stan Lee makes a cameo as a juror in this same sequence.  6.  The cringe-worthy FX shots of Fisk's getaway vehicle in the finale mark an all-time low for this once-proud TV series.

All in all, the Incredible Hulk returns in two cheaply made, live-action cartoons, but at least they are entertaining and generally harmless enough for kids.  However, the ""Trial"" has a few dark moments (i.e. violence against the female guest star) that deserves some thought by parents before letting an impressionable kid watch those scenes.  Ultimately, the late Bill Bixby's reliable acting (though not nearly his best) anchors the formulaic storylines enough to retain the original program's fan base.

Rating: 7/10.  The bottom line is that undemanding viewers will get their money's worth.",1311638400,,5402,5.1689655172413795

Even as a kid I knew that Thor was missing his cape and that Daredevil dressed in red, not black, but the excitement and creativity of the interpretation kept me glued to the set.

369515,3,6301813480,"During the 70s, the Incredible Hulk was my favorite non-space sci-fi series. Like Doctor Kimble of the 60s Fugitive series, Doctor David Banner was forced by circumstances beyond his control to wander like a fugitive from state to state and city to city, seeking low-profile work and a way to undo the serious condition that an extremely high dose of gamma radiation has left him with. While Kimble sought the one-armed man who killed his wife, Banner, on the other hand, must discover a way to reverse his condition. The condition is a physical transformation which he experiences whenever his anger turns into an uncontrollable rage; the huge green beast which Jack McGee, the reporter that hounds him, has labeled the Hulk.

Of the two movies included in this package, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk is the better one. The Incredible Hulk Returns was okay, but somehow, pairing him up with the Mighty Thor, another comic book hero, while obviously a bit of fun, didn't quite make the kind of impression that the original series did. It was interesting to revisit Banner's situation almost a decade later, after the series ended, but having Thor enter the scene at the lab and suddenly begin breaking things didn't go over so well. It was too much like, oh, here we go again, so close but yet so far, poor Banner gets set back again...

Apparently, Doctor Banner had worked for years with a very highly advanced scientific company experimenting with a new source of alternative energy, and suddenly, Blake appears with Thor and begins to smash it all to pieces. Hasn't Banner suffered enough already? This kind of treatment, while obviously part of the story-line, was simply very difficult to sit through. After that, it was just another overdone story about an insider in the company selling industrial trade secrets and getting in too deep over his head with the wrong kind of criminals. An attempt at theft at the company is thwarted by the Hulk, then his girlfriend is kidnapped, and Thor and the Hulk rescue her, etc...

But The Trial of the Incredible Hulk was much more than all that. In this movie, we see the Doctor Banner that we learned to sympathize for and love for his amazing ability to tolerate what so many of us know too well; the down-side of human society, where hard knocks and poverty combine to make a very cruel reality. Right from the start, Banner is seen working in an irrigation ditch, on a large farm, with a gang of roughians, in the cold of the late autumn or winter, and a bully pushes him into a small pool of cold water and laughs, then urges Banner to start a fight with him. Banner is tempted, but declines, and leaves, obviously sick of being bullied by the brute.

From there, he collects his last pay and heads for the nearest city. In the city, while Banner checks into a seedy, low-rent hotel and goes out to look for work, we're introduced to a blind lawyer, entering his office, who basks in the sunlight of the window while he updates the situation with his secretary and partner. From them, we learn about an extremely powerful crime-lord that has been corrupting the city-government, whom they are determined to take down. Later, we see the blind lawyer change into the Dare-Devil, a local super-hero, destined to meet the Hulk.

In the next scene, we see some of the crime-lord's team in action, as they rob a large cache of diamonds from a jewelry store in broad daylight. After the heist, 2 of the main thugs escape the scene on a subway and one begins to make a move on an innocent female passenger. Unfortunately, Banner is sitting quite close to the woman and she asks for his help. The thug is obviously a very egocentric fool that thinks he can take whatever he wants in the city, including any attractive female he sees on a subway. A few other passengers are scared away, but Banner caves in to the pleas of the woman and confronts the man. Seconds later, both of the men are on Banner and he gets tossed behind some seats. Enter the Incredible Hulk, and the story begins.

What happens is the incident results in the accidental death of an innocent bystander when one of the thugs tries to shoot him and when the cops enter the scene, the Hulk runs off into the dark subway tunnel and gets lost in some dark corner. When the cops find him, they arrest him for the killing of the innocent bystander, and the thugs get to the girl in the hospital and threaten her family, so that she is forced to place the blame on Banner. While Banner is being held, the blind lawyer talks to him and agrees to defend his case, because he knows that the crime-lord's thugs are the real problem and Banner has given them a lead on them.

Well, I'm not going to tell the whole story, but the point is, it is much more interesting than The Return and the plot isn't so thin. It has some fascinating characters and a much thicker plot with deeper implications.

""Trial"" just didn't seem as interesting to me. The story was adequate, (for a Hulk show), but it dragged quite a bit. OK, I'll also `fess-up that Rex Smith's portrayal of Matt Murdock/Daredevil grated on my nerves too. I'd throw it a bone of 3 stars as bonus curiosity material only.

""The Incredible Hulk Returns"", is where the fun lies in this two-disc set. We have the usual drama of the David Banner character but with the relief of a boisterous Thor!!! I like Bill Bixby's acting but it seemed unusually depressing in these movies. Oh, he's good but he's almost too good for the B-movie material he's confined to on these productions. It's kind of like having a new Rolls Royce on a beat-up used car lot. It looks good on its own but it doesn't fit the environment it's residing in. Eric Allan Kramer's portrayal of Thor, in ""Returns"", really helps add some needed levity to the story. He wants to lock-it-up with Hulk and is a wreckless bar brawler to boot. This humor is sorely lacking in ""Trial"" which is just a plain downer.

Just on the merits of, ""The Incredible Hulk Returns"", I give the set 4 stars. Again, treat everything else beyond this particular movie as filler. After saying that, I would add that the bonus material is generous and a nice addition. What more can you ask for? Extended features on Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno! It would have been sweet to have a little homage to Bixby, but you can't have everything. Enjoy it for what it is - goofy super-hero frolicking.",1197590400,,1626,4.565068493150685

I mean, c'mon... the series made an intelligent and successful effort to legitimize the idea of the comic character, The Hulk, and later someone comes up with him meeting a Norse God?!? So much for the legitimizing.  Anyway, the ""movie"" that is advertised here on Amazon ISN'T THE ONE YOU GET!  In Amazon's credits and description, they are advertising the SECOND TV movie that came AFTER the original pilot movie of the series, that was later broken down into a two-part episode called ""Death in the Family"", which was considerably better than the movie with THOR.  ""Death in the Family"" is NOT for sale all by itself, as this ad suggests, but is ONLY available in the ""Best Of...""

2. Where's the original series?

I mean, I *love* the Incredible Hulk. Bill Bixby does a fabulous job as the tortured David Banner.  Everytime I watch the scene where Elana caresses the Hulk's cheek and says, ""My poor David.  I have loved you for so very long..."" it brings tears to my eyes.  Lou Ferrigno is the exception to the rule that musclemen can't act.

I've only got the pilot on DVD and I want more.  Bring back the series!  Bring back the haunting title music that almost makes your cry in of itself, and the angst and drama and action.

Not to mention, I was a kid in the eighties and I have a fondness for those wonderful eighties t.v. shows. I own Dukes of Hazzard, Knight Rider, The A-Team and Magnum P.I.  I would buy Incredible Hulk in a flash if they came out. Its one of the better shows to come out of the eighties.

369589,4,6301813480,"An incredibly affordable 2 disc set with great extras highlights two TV movie adventures of the Incredible Hulk.

Bill Bixby & Lou Ferrigno's hit TV series set a milestone for comic book characters.  Before that, arguably the only superhero who had a hit was Batman & Superman in the movies.  TV movies and TV shows of everyone from Spiderman to Captain America to Dr. Strange had all either failed outright or fizzled quickly.  With Kenneth Johnson's drama of the Hulk, the creator turned Stan Lee's green pulp hero into something even grandmothers could love - and mine LOVED the Hulk TV series.

Purists might object to the way the two guest star superheroes are treated and portrayed here.  I have no problems with either.  Both Eric Kramer (Thor) and Rex Smith (Daredevil) manage their respective roles nicely and have pure fun all the while - especially Kramer who turned an almost stiff, stodgy comic book Thor into a CA beefcake surfer dude with a love of mead and bar brawls.  Rex Smith turns in a three dimensional performance and honestly I like his portrayal of Daredevil much more than Ben Affleck's big screen turn.  Bill Bixby realizes his tortured Jeckyl & Hyde David Banner character as poignantly as he did in the TV series and the production values for both flicks are top notch all around.

Comic fans must make concessions when their beloved heroes play up on the big or small screen.  When film director Bryan Singer toned down the X-Men's costumes for the theatrical film, many a true believer cried.  However when they saw the film, Singer was off the hook.  These TV movies are NOT the comics we grew up on and so much the better because they've become unique interpretations of them for us to enjoy alongside the classic comics, cartoons or the video games which will be created for generations to come.

Anchor Bay has outdone themselves with excellent extras, packaging that evokes a comic book and even a booklet that at first glance makes you believe you're holding a collectible comic.  Fantastic price & fantastic set - thanks Anchor Bay!",1154476800,20,2070,4.775280898876405

Mr. Colvin all but carried the series and deserved a much larger role than a measly walk-on.
""Returns"" is rubbish.  The idea of Thor and ""the power of Odin"" makes my stomach curl.  There is absolutely no redeeming qualities or anything slightly resembling the Kenneth Johnson series at all here except the Mcgee and Thor scene with is absolutely brilliant and hilarious.  Colvin's acting has aged like a fine wine and once again he proves his genius and wit.
""Trial"" though a slight improvement over ""Return"" should have actually been called ""Daredevil (featuring the Hulk)"".  The original Idea for the Trial was for Banner to be on trial for the murder of Elena Marks from the original pilot episode but I think that Bixby might hung out too much with Elvis in his lifetime because these movies resemble an Elvis movie at it's worse.

While not the best of all the movies it does have a charm and good message to the story to be true to yourself.  The second; The Trial presents Hulk fighting along with Daredevil against the Kingpin. This version of Daredevil is superior to the movie becuse it presents Daredevil as he should be. Without the CGI of the modern versions this one one still has legs and still holds up.

In those two years, he has been working on the cure to his ailment and living with a fellow scientist named Maggie Shaw. All hell breaks loose however when a colleague from the past named Donald Blake shows up with his own problem named Thor! That, along with terriorists that want to steal the very device that may free Banner from his Hulk curse, makes it a good thrill ride!
In ""Trial"", we see that David has moved northwest to a city that's never identified. Once there, he tries to help a woman who is sexual assaulted by two thugs that work for the crime boss The Kingpin! During the melee, he turns into the Hulk and is later arrested for the attack! Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer, comes to David's aid both as a lawyer and as his vigilante alter ego DareDevil.

He lives in a world were crime runs all over the place even in a blue uniform and it's all run by The Kingpin, and he hates it.

369660,4,6301813480,"In former days, that is to say from 1978 to 1982, there was a television series called ""The Incredible Hulk,"" which served to answer the question what if you crossed ""The Fugitive"" with the Jolly Green Giant.  David Bruce Banner (Bill Bixby) was a brilliant scientist who was studying the effects of stress on physical strength.  In a classic laboratory accident he was exposed to a massive dosage of gamma rays.  The result was that when Banner became angry, he turned into the Incredible Hulk (Lou Ferrigno).  Banner spent four seasons traveling around the country trying to find a cure and stay one step ahead of Jack McGee (Jack Colvin), the tabloid reporter on his heels.  Of course, at every stop he made his alter ego would announce his presence with authority at some point and save the day.
""The Incredible Hulk Returns"" was the 1988 television movie, which, despite its title, was also a test run for a television show about another Marvel superhero, the Mighty Thor.  The two were clearly kindred spirits since you had ""normal"" Dr. Donald Blake (Steve Levitt) and the Norse god of thunder (Eric Allan Kramer), who is actually now downgraded to an ancient Viking warrior to avoid religious implications.  Banner is now working at the Joshua Lambert Institute (under the name of Banyan) on the development of a gamma transponder, a device that will provide cheap, clean energy for the world (good) while getting rid of the Hulk forever (even better).  ""Banyan"" is involved with Dr. Maggie Shaw (Lee Purcell), but cannot get series with her until he curbs his inner monster.  Then his old colleague Blake shows up with his own inner creature (who is most decided NOT the noble Thor of the Stan Lee & Jack Kirby comic book).  Blake shows Banner what happens with his magic hammer, which triggers the transformation of both into their alter egos and leads to a big fight.  Then, just for fun, we throw in Maggie being kidnapped by Jack LeBeau (Tim Thomerson) who wants the gamma transponder as her ransom.  You can figure out the rest from this point.
The good news here is that ""The Incredible Hulk Returns"" is not simply a rehash of the story.  Banner has actually tried to rebuild his life while looking for his cure instead of continue to wander from town to town.  This actually breathes some new life into the character.  The bad news is that Thor is now suddenly a super-macho beer guzzler, and even despite the fact he has been downgraded from being the Norse god of thunder (he is a god, he just does not play one on TV), there are still lightning effects (pretty good ones too).  The plot is pedestrian, which is par for comic book superheroes, but it does not just rehash the television series, which is a point to the good.

The Incredible Hulk Returns ***
In the time this title takes place it has been two years (TV time) since the series ended.  In that time Bruce Banner (Bixby) has not transformed into the Hulk (Ferrigno) in some time.  In that time he has worked for a major scientific corporation under a different identity hoping to find a cure for his other half. He has a beutiful girlfriend and he seems to be on the right track.  However an old face from the past emerges one day and turns his life upside down.  The young man then spills out this incredible tale about a journey into the mountains of Norway and how he was chosen by Odin to be the guide of fallen Norse Warrior Thor.  When the boy summons Thor the end result is that once again Bruce transforms into the Hulk.  Meanwhile the machine he is working on is the target of a set of thieves run by Tim Thomerson.  In the end it is up to the Hulk and THor to stop the thieves.
The reason this only gets *** stars is because it is more focused on THor and it's to campy.  The story is good but the script and presentation just made me laugh.  Thor was a joke in this movie but it turned out OK.  In the end it had a sad ending that was kind of a downer, until trial.
Trial of the Incredible Hulk *****
In Trial, Bruce is now working small jobs across the country.  He is making little money, just enough to survive.  Time period seems to be about a year and eventually he arrives in an unnamed city.  This city is run by an evil mob boss called Wilson Fisk, aka the King Pin.  However in this town another Hero lurks out there trying to put an end to Fisk and his criminal Empire, that man is Daredevil.  After Bruce rescues a woman from being raped (accidentally turns into Hulk in the process) he is arrested for attempted Murder.  MAtt Murdock (Daredevil) takes his case on the basis that the men work for Kingpin.  After Bruce finds out that Murdock is Daredevil they team up to stop the Kingpin.
This is a good made for TV movie on the basis that the plot is well made, the feel is not that campy, and the action is well coreographed.  In the end there is a sense of Hope for Bruce as he is finds out another company is working on a similar project like in the return and he is off.
Overall this is a solid collection to own, if they had just included the Death of the Incredible Hulk this would have been perfect.  Hoever in the end this is a solid collection to own.",1051747200,,2694,4.190291262135922
369727,5,6301813480,"Bill Bixby returns as his most requested television character role.  I don't think anyone could get beaten up as well as David Banner.  The Return of the Incredible Hulk, is a great way to bring back the beloved television characters.  This film has David Banner hoping to finally cure himself of the Hulk, but he doesn't.  Not only does the Hulk return, but now Thor is in on the action, and throughout this movie, there is plenty of action!
  The follow up to this movie, is even better!  The Trial of The Incredible Hulk.  This film has the Hulk paired with DareDevil. The story was excellent, and had plenty of action from both characters.  What I liked best about this movie was at the end.  David Banner, was able to control the Hulk, was not beaten up, and he even put a forceful hold on a bad guy!  I'm sure that some fans wanted more Hulk, but for once it was nice to see Bill Bixby get tough on his own.  (Thanks Bill, for putting so much into your character through the years, and for helping bring back a legend!  We miss you, God Bless...",1046390400,6,1051,4.328205128205128

369729,1,6301813480,"I'll be brief. I LOVED the Hulk in all his iterations. The comic, and the original run of the series, heck I even give the cartoon on Saturday morning credit.
HOWEVER, this movie [wasnt good].
Using the Hulk to push this spin-off vehicle for Marvel's Thor was a terrible idea and totally ran against the grain of what was a decent sci-fi drama TV series, even with the token appearance of Jack McGee.
The subsequent Daredevil idea in the ""Trial of The Incredible Hulk"" was equally weak.
Only in the third movie, ""Death of the Incredible Hulk"" did they come even close to the flavor of the original series.
I would say only the most hardcore fan with blinders on could really appreciate this movie.",1034640000,3,697,4.584

7815845,4,6301813480,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1988 and written & directed by Nicholas Corea, The Incredible Hulk Returns is the first of three movies in the wake of the TV series that ran from 1977-82.

PLOT: Bill Bixby stars as Dr. David Banner, who is working incognito at a research facility in Southern California and on the verge of curing his gamma radiation-induced curse. Meanwhile Banner reunites with younger colleague Don Blake (Steve Levitt), who has found a magical Norse hammer, which can summon Thor (Eric Allan Kramer), an ancient Viking warrior. When a vital piece of technology is nearly stolen and David's sweetheart is kidnapped (Lee Purcell), the Hulk (Lou Ferrigno) and Thor must team-up to save the day. Jack Colvin returns as nosy reporter Jack McGee.

Despite the TV-budget limitations, this is a very entertaining Hulk movie, even better than the pilot movie from 1977. This is mostly due to the inclusion of Thor, whos pretty close to the Marvel Comics version (Stan Lee was a consultant), albeit with a brown costume rather than dark blue. This is because Thor here is (evidently) NOT the god of thunder from Asgard, but rather a mighty Viking from the distant past aided by the mystic hammer. His personality isn't like Thor in the comics (i.e. one-dimensionally noble and boring), but rather like Marvels Hercules, where hes hearty, loves a good fight, women & brew. Kramer knocks the role out of the ballpark with his merry & mighty charisma.

The biker bar episode is a highlight with Peisha Arten standing out as one of the Whoa, Mama biker babes. The ending is kind of sad accompanied by Joseph Harnells melancholic piano theme.

THE FILM RUNS 93 minutes and was shot in California (Malibu, North Hollywood and Los Angeles). ADDITIONAL DIRECTING: Bill Bixby. ADDITIONAL CAST: Charles Napier, Tim Thomerson and Jay Baker.
