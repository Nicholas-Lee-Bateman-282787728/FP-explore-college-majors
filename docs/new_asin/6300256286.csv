283967,5,6300256286,"""I'm a retired spy."" -- Deborah Kerr to Trevor Howard

If ever a film about a young Irish lass so passionate in her distaste for the English that she ends up working as a German spy during WWII could be described as airily charming, this is it. A pleasant Irish lilt can be heard and felt in Deborah Kerr's enchanting performance as the feisty but quite naive Birdie Quilty. Regaled by her father's tales of the Irish from the time she was a wee lassie, as a young woman she sets out to find the man he supposedly fought with and join in the rebellion. Her father's tales were pure blarney, of course, and when rebuffed, she becomes a spy for the Germans simply because they're against the Brits!

Frank Launder and Sidney Gillant concocted this tasty Irish stew as pleasant to look at as it is to savor, thanks to photographer Wilkie Cooper, and a breathtaking Deborah Kerr. Birdie's inner thoughts are given voice by Kerr throughout the film and offer more than a small amount of humor. Trevor Howard proves quite likable as the Army Intelligence Officer who is quite smitten with Birdie, despite her bewildering behavior. Even knowing she dumped a body into the ocean for some peculiar reason can't keep him from chasing her. He was already a goner, of course, and had asked her to do it to protect herself.

Birdie ends up way over her head and once she realizes Irish lives are at stake, has a change of heart. It's not so easy to just quit, however, especially when those bad guys want the information you've destroyed. A fun escape through an Irish funeral procession and mad dash for Eire, cap off a unique film. But just because she's one of the good guys now, doesn't mean she's a bit less Irish! Once the viewer settles in to the special mood of this delightful and pleasant film they'll have an excellent time. A must for classic film fans.",1267920000,5,1852,4.522388059701493
283968,5,6300256286,"Lovers of old, black and white mystery movies should get a kick out of this one.  A young, idealistic Irish girl sets off for England during WWII to do something...ANYTHING... to further the Irish cause against England.  Her naivete and zeal cause her to be secuced into aiding German spies against the Allies.  Trevor Howard portrays the man who eventually saves her from herself.
  Altogether a delightful story of intrigue, murder, humor, and romance with a peppery mix of Irish/English politics brought to life by an outstanding performance by a youthful Deborah Kerr.  The film was produced at a time when excellent screen writing and outstanding acting were the things that captivated an audience, rather than computer-generated special effects.
  This is an exceptional film.  Grab a DVD of it for your collection while you can still get one.",1262044800,3,849,5.094202898550725
283969,4,6300256286,"The rise to prominence in American films during the forties of an outstanding British beauty with dazzingly red hair, and intense, sparkling green eyes is a twice-told story. The first go around is with Greer Garson, the second is with Deborah Kerr. Of the two Kerr's was the better, longer career. Garson was a fully matured and highly touted stage actress of 35 nearing the top of her skills when she first hit Hollywood. She was all charm and lightness as financee to Robert Donat's Oscar-winning shy Mr. Chips, and Garson herself won an Oscar soon thereafter as wartime icon Mrs. Miniver. Garson then proceeded to perform at a respectable level for another dozen or so years in increasingly unremarkable films. By contrast, Deborah Kerr started in films at a far younger age than Garson; Kerr was not even twenty when she made her first film appearance, and she developed and grew into an highly accomplished screen actress as her career progressed over the course of nearly another quarter century before leading roles ended. Kerr was still barely a little over thirty when she broke ranks from the usual Hollywood type casting that found her playing a British lady - as the sexy adultress washing in the waves with Burt Lancaster in ""From Here to Eternity"".

In ""I See a Dark Stranger"", a surprise hit of 1946, Kerr is asked to carry the entire film's human sympathies. Suspense and plot both advance the story and offer her scene after scene to take over, which she unfailingly does. Given the seemingly impossible task of eliciting sympathy from post wartime audiences for a headstrong young Irish girl who hates the British so much she moves to Dublin to join the IRA, Kerr wins over the entire audience to her complicated young woman. Moreover, she continues this emotional bond when after failing to find a home with that stalwart organization, she joins up instead with the Germans as a spy against the Brits! In many ways this part asks way too much of any actress in a Britain only just relieved of ending a dreadful war with Germany, but Kerr certainly rises to the challenge.

How Kerr achieves such an acting tour de force at the tender age of 25 astonishes. The film's success as film makes most sense within the context of other Kerr's roles, and particularly other recent roles, more provocative roles than normally associated with her today. What one notices immediately about Kerr here as actress is her God-given gift for evoking a deep heart-felt sympathy from an audience, while never at any time explicitly asking for such sympathy. It's a remarkable balancing act! Although her reputation in America today remains that of a lady-like person, in fact her best roles have shown Kerr a far more determined and delving student of troubled human character. Her Irish spy in ""I See a Dark Stranger"" is one of these roles.

In her prior big success, ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"", Kerr plays three roles - the first finds her a turn of the century, self-assured suffragette and patriot, who loses a governess job in Germany over her principles. In her third role in the film, with the unnerving militaristic masculine moniker of Johnny Cannon!, Kerr not only bests her lover in argument, but while he's in full military gear loses her patience, strikes him over the head knocking him out, and dashes off forcing him to groggily give chase. Throughout the film her proper but determined characters struggle with inner conflicts, and it is always her courage that wins us over to her.

This is precisely the great charm of her role in ""I See a Dark Stranger"". Kerr's quietly determined Irish revolutionary looks beyond herself, and dreams of reawakening the stories of 1916 and the native struggles against the onerous British Rule. Once caught up in the true realites to such a stance in a world at war Kerr's character discovers she's losing control of her life. Her existence turns into a dangerous and scary world of uncertainty and fear, of confusing ambiquities, and growing threats on her own person. It's all a fabulously entertaining young Bildunsgroman, and Kerr plays her dominant role to the hilt. Watching her complicated reaction to Trevor Howard's attempt at an embrace on an Irish hillside exemplifies all that is so marvelous about her acting. With an offhand touch of her original Scott's burr, Kerr looks back and forth, eyes raised in effrontery, as she wiggles away announcing in a countrified manner, ""I must be sittin' on a thistle!""

Set alongside her very next performance, as the shy Irish nun gone to the Himalayas in the unforgettable ""Black Narcissus""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Narcissus-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004XQN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Narcissus - Criterion Collection</a>, Kerr as spy acts far more confidently in challenging her world. But certainly both portraits draw from the same heart-felt confusions and difficulties confronting a perplexed young person with a confusing morality of the world. Her flashbacks to life in Ireland in ""Black Narcissus"" are among the finest in all of film, expressing in a few minutes her entire reason fo ending up a sister at the roof of heaven. (Naturally the American Catholics, for whom the idea of nuns with a prior life was intolerablee, demanded these scenes be removed when the film was released in America!)

A lovely performance all round by an actress who never receives the full attention she deserves. Don't miss the entirety of Kerr's great long scene with the wheelchair - worthy of the best moments from the screen writers previous efforts for Hitchcock, it deserves credit as memorable film-making.

Note: For some reason this very British film is only available on DVD in the Region Code for North America. The quality of the print is about average for films of this era. I've watched it twice, the second time on a state of the art television and using a Blurray DVD player to up the image. The results were a marked improvemment - giving a far better image quality, sense of depth. Scenes set in darkness or low light - there are a several crucial ones in this spy thriller - no longer left me squinting to see what was going on.",1257984000,4,6217,4.960652591170826

283972,4,6300256286,"A post-WWII B&W film featuring the beautiful Deborah Kerr.  There are a couple of other significant names from that era in the film (Raymond Huntley, Trevor Howard), but this is really The Deborah Kerr Show.

Kerr superbly takes on the character of a 21 year old Irish girl, in 1944, with a chip on her shoulder against the English (which she inherited from her late father).  She makes a fumbling attempt to get into the IRA, is rejected, but then later recruited by German spies.

An entertaining spy story with some GREAT historic and landscape footage from Ireland and Britain during the period. Also is an interesting look at the politics of the time.  The plot is not really rocket science, but is a vehicle for Kerr to turn in a remarkable performance as the young Irish  would-be revolutionary.

The transfer was a little jumpy in the first few minutes, but then crystal clear black-and white throughout.  The soundtrack was adequate, but with the music typically ""tinny"", of that film era.  Very British.",1205625600,4,1013,4.809248554913295
283973,4,6300256286,"This comparatively little known film may not bear comparison with the very best, but it certainly does not justify the comparative neglect it has been subject to, at least in this country. It is a very satisfying comedy-thriller, and well worth watching, with a good performance, as usual, from Deborah Kerr.",1127520000,9,308,5.0588235294117645
283974,4,6300256286,"Deborah Kerr and Trevor Howard costar in this unusual spy story, wherein Kerr plays a young Irish lass, raised on her dad's romantic self-mythologizing ""war stories"" of the 1916 Irish rebellion, who goes to England to fight against the British oppressors.  It being the middle of World War Two, she decides the enemy of her enemy is her friend, and she hooks up with a German spymaster, gathinging information from the jovial soldiers that frequent the local pub... She comes around, of course, once she realizes that passing on the information about the upcoming D-Day invasion may cost the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers, but in between she is a uniquely unsympathetic protagonist.  It's amazing that this particular story would have been filmed so close after the close of the war, when the extent of German barbarity haad been so clearly exposed; the bigger point seems to have been to diffuse and sideline Irish political separatism... Still, as a silly spy film, this is reasonably enjoyable... it's just a little weird around the edges.",1066867200,4,1051,4.965909090909091
283975,4,6300256286,"The team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliatt specialized in smart, witty, quintessentially British thrillers of the sort that made Hitchcock's name-- and not only did they write one of Hitchcock's first big successes, The Lady Vanishes, Gilliatt really invented the minigenre of the droll train-based thriller with 1932's Rome Express while Hitchcock was still learning his trade.  (After The Lady Vanishes they wrote its sort-of-sequel, Night Train to Munich, which I for one think is even better.)
Deborah Kerr stars as an Irish lass with stars in her eyes for the Irish cause, which get her caught in the intrigues of a Nazi spy (the scarily cold Raymond Huntley).  It was Kerr's breakthrough performance (and one that may seem familiar since Maureen O'Hara copies it closely in The Quiet Man).  Especially compared with today's sub-Republic-serial action films, the suspense scenes are well thought out and present believable problems (how DO you get rid of a body from the second floor of an inn in a small town where everyone knows you?), and the comic touches (note the surreal ""twin"" bureaucrats) are sharply observed.
The presence of Trevor Howard as a light romantic lead in this film reminds us that as British thrillers got more serious after the war-- in such films as The Third Man, The Clouded Yellow and They Made Me a Fugitive, all starring Howard and making use of his dour, seen-awful-things-in-wartime manner-- Launder and Gilliatt weren't really capable of following.  But when it comes to amusingly British, skillfully exciting entertainments in the 1930s and 1940s, they were first-rate and deserve to be better remembered.",1057881600,24,1647,5.134328358208955

7807722,5,6300256286,"PLOT: young Irish girl decides to become a spy for Ireland but becomes part of a Nazi Scheme.

Young impressionable ""Bridie Quilty"" (DEBORAH KERR) listens to the mostly ""made up schemes"" of her father Danny Quiilty who very much impresses and even brain washes Bridie of his IRA tales.  At the age of 21 Bridie sets off to ""join"" the IRA. As she finds a job in a England as a barmaid she is soon ""recruited"" by Nazis Agents who use her hatred of the Brits. She is used to ""distract"" Trevor Howard a royal artillery officer who is mistaken for military intelligence. He is there for a vacation and decides to romance a very reluctant Bridie. The spies release a Nazi who knows the details about the invasion of France ...The Spy ends up shot but not before he passed ""secrets"" to Bridie who is soon on the way to the Isle of Man to retrieve a black book complete with Invasion Secrets. Bridie is clever enough to have a conscience and discovers she has been duped. But is soon kidnapped along with Howard by Nazi Agents. This is a fun little spy thriller. Bridie is both indoctrinated with false ideas and silly enough to act on them. She at times is brilliantly clever when she dumps a dead spy into the sea during a rainstorm. I give this one 5 STARS~ for excellent plot and even more brilliant is a young Kerr who keeps us glued to the spy adventures of Bridie.",1466121600,,1363,4.362204724409449
