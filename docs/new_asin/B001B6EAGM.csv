8282001,5,B001B6EAGM,"If ever you are looking for a product than can succinctly but respectfully explore the concepts of the Transcendentalists, this is a film for you.  The readings are great. The visuals excellent and, best of all, the menu of choices to be used: long narrative form, chapters, or even extremely short vignettes, makes this a very versatile product for home, classroom, even church discussion group usage.  We have used the short vignetters of Life in Nature, Awake, Aware, Alive, and the excellent interviews with world leaders in UU church services this summer.  The scholarly discussion and curriculum aids are lengthy and very helpful.  I hope the production team does more of this sort of thing for other Transcendentalists - specifically, Emerson, Fuller, Peabody and Alcott. Can't rate this product highly enough!",1309478400,,817,5.213740458015267
8282002,5,B001B6EAGM,"Thoreau has several things to say about life and how to live it.  First and foremost he advises that we should be ourselves and not a product that others would shape us to be. ""He who trims himself to suit others will shortly whittle himself away."" Not a quote from Henry David, but it does reflect his thinking.

""Life With Principle,"" the title is taken from the essay Thoreau wrote in his early years, ""Life Without Principle,"" is an excellent introduction for young and old to the wisdom Thoreau gave the world during his short life. This video is especially suitable for classroom use at the middle school level and above.",1237766400,,627,4.63963963963964
8282003,5,B001B6EAGM,"Life with Principle has  a special feauture  film ""Thoreau's Concord/Walden Pond"" which is great. Also on the ROM content of "" Life with Principle ""there is the best of ""The Thoreau Bulletin"" from 1941-2000. Selling on a CD at the Thoreau shop for US$50.
This DVD-ROM is an Educational marvel.",1228348800,,293,4.84
