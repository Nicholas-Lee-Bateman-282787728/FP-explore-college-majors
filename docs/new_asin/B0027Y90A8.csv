8355260,2,B0027Y90A8,"I purchased the Beginner/Intermediate and the Advanced DVDs from HAL Leonard which were mastered by BCI Media LLC. The DVDs were recorded improperly. The camera shots are fine, if somewhat pedestrian which is normal for how-to videos.

However, when the narrator is showing computer screens, the capture program cannot lock the horizontal stabilizer. The computer screens jittery up and down so much my eyes were bugging out. I was trying to watch the DVD lessons on the computer then try to execute the same tasks on the computer. This was not possible.

It DVD is watchable in the TV but still has noticeable horizontal stability problems. This defeats the purpose of watching and practicing since you would have to move from the TV to the computer each time you wanted to try something.

The DVD should be called ""Beginner Video Recording Project"" since it is a very amateurish production, hardly one expects to get stuck with these days.",1264464000,,941,4.943037974683544

I have described this book as the ""War and Peace"" of Sonar.",1260835200,,254,4.3125
