8137445,5,B000H7K9MK,"THE STORY: A rousing pirate adventure story, the Mooncussers were real-life pirates who lured merchant ships at sea onto the treacherous rocks of Long Island in the 1840's. The name Mooncusser is a result of their cussing the moon for it's brightness, since it's glow allowed ships to see the shoreline and possible pirates.  They used false lights, and shut off the real lighthouse to trick ships as to the distance to shore. When the ships crashed they claimed the goods as salvage. The pirates are planning a very big haul this time, the clipper ship Emily of the  E.P. Hallett line.  But wealthy ship-owner E.P. Hallett (Robert Burton) sends his strapping son who is also a ship captain, Dan Hallett, (Rian Garrick) to investigate since he has already lost one ship in the area and does not plan to lose another. He moves into town to start his own secret investigation. They suspect foul play and Jonathan Feather (Kevin Corcoran)  is a 12 year old boy who witnessed the destruction caused by the pirates and is willing to fight against the plunderers. The show combines mystery, suspense, period drama, romance, comedy, and action/adventure. Winner of an Emmy Award , the show has an authentic period flavor, and is non-stop fun and an overlooked classic gem in the Disney Studio library.

BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA:  Walt Disney liked to bring together people he knew and had worked with before for his projects, and this was no exception. Bill Anderson co-produced this for Walt Disney, originally created as a two part episode for the television show, Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. Anderson had headed up productions before for Walt when he produced the ""Swiss Family Robinson"", the Zorro television series, and the Swamp Fox series. Directed by James Nielson, who had directed other Disney hits including the popular Scarecrow of Romney Marsh, Moon Pilot, Moon Spinner, and Summer Magic. Young Kevin Corcoran was a star who performed ably in 9 Disney theatrical releases, and another 8 films for television while working for Disney and was instantly recognizable in Disney shows. The script was adapted by Lowell Hanley from a book called ""Flying Ebony"", by Iris Vinton.

The famous song writing team the Sherman Brothers that worked on Mary Poppins and so many other Disney studio projects were asked by Walt to write ""a sea chanty about land-locked pirates"" according to their biography, and this became the title song, ""The Ballad of the Moon-Cussers"". The song helps move the story along introducing you to the background of the plot. Long time Disney studio composer George Bruns wrote the rest of the score music for the film. The show won an Emmy Award  for Art Direction, for the work by Carroll Clark, and Marvin Aubrey Davis. With their work, the costumes by Chuck Koehner, and the set decoration by studio veteran Emile Kuri the look is authentic to the period. The show was first seen by the public when it aired on the Disney television show as a two part episode appearing December 2 & 9, 1962. The first episode was titled ""Graveyard of Ships"", and the second was ""Wake of Disaster"".  The episodes aired as a repeat on August  4 & 11, 1963. Following that the two episodes were re-edited into one complete movie at 85 minutes in length for a European theatrical release in 1966. That is the version that was released to VHS in 1987 for the first time, and the only version available today that I am aware of. It is definitely worthy of a DVD release. All in all a very fun family friendly action/adventure film that has terrific period sets, and costumes.",1213315200,15,3591,4.805510534846029
