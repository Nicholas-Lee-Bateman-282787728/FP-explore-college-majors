6333305,5,B00J4LMKMW,"Lorenzo (Gary Moore) is a tough/successful collection agent. He's also on the lam being personally in deep debt, and currently in Norfolk, VA. He is threatened by `Uncle' Frankie (Danny Trejo) whom is owed thousands. The crime boss's nephew thug Omar (David Krusen) is assigned duty to keep an eye, or kill if necessary. Lorenzo comes up with a plan to use a local street aid mission (LEC) people to get the thousands needed for his own life saving benefit. From there it gets comic. Really.

Omar finds faith's salvation through Jesus preached at the mission. A plan proves that Lorenzo is truly a louse as lousy as they come. He collects funds in cash in amounts less than half below the company's goal keeping it for himself--even gambling with it. But just when Lorenzo thinks he's free it gets worse. The humor quickly adjusts to second chances and hope for others, including a homeless mission guy drunk, former aide to Bush the father, played by Christobal Krusen, who also manages to write, direct, and produce.

Multiple roles are common in these low-budget faith based films. I like to review them for what they are, a film as a mission, with a message. This DVD is Dove Approved, but does have some violence scenes. I was pleasantly surprised, as was my wife. A message to goodness and hope but light on the preaching. It's not high dollar Hollywood, not professing to be, but gets an entertainment job done well, and more. It's a mix of new and seasoned cast. Hollywood could not do this on the same budget, I suspect. The story was inspired in part by the real LEC -Life Enrichment Center of Norfolk.

There is CC and Subtitles but they seem to lag behind the scene. Maybe too much for those who truly can't hear. Other bonus includes 3 behind the scenes segments: 4 min of cast/crew commentary; 2 min of the shoot out scene; and 3 min of a dock scene. 7 advertising trailers are also included.",1325980800,9,1907,4.602941176470588
6333306,5,B00J4LMKMW,"It was a good movie.  I liked the innocence of the black church willing to put their name on the line and stand up for a person of bad reputation.  It's pretty much like REAL LIFE, probably my mother would say if it was so much like life as we know it that we have to laugh to keep from crying.  When I watch movies, I always try to identify with someone in the movie, and Ron Kenolly played his part extremely well.  It pretty much turns out the way a person would hope it turns out, only in the movies do we get these pleasant endings, but it is well worth 3 bowls of caramel popcorn. I think I'll buy a couple of copies to give away as Christmas gifts.",1319414400,3,655,3.9770992366412212

Way too much manipulation going on in just about everything he does.  The villian I liked better as he was true to form and predictable.  The hero, I kept waiting for him to do something good for the sake of doing good..... I'm still waiting....

This flick does show us what we can get ourselves into when we leave the Lord out of the equation.

6333342,4,B00J4LMKMW,"This intriguing little film is not exactly what a viewer would expect from seeing the picture on the case. That is a big reason why it has a 4-star rating and I considered a three. It's better than a four but not quite a five. Stop reading now to avoid spoilers.

From the cover, I figured The Bill Collector would be a Danny Trejo action film. Being a big Danny Trejo fan and having just about the runtime of the film available, when I saw the title I opened the film. It started out a little differently than I expected but after a strange set-up, my man came stalking in and I expected everything to hit the fan - or at least Lorenzo (Gary Ray Moore) to go flying across the room and bounce off the wall. After all, he does owe Frankie (Trejo) money. Wrong. The threat is delayed but Frankie leaves big giant Omar (David Krusen) with Lorenzo while he rounds up the money to pay his debt.

Lorenzo sets out to collect the money any and every dishonest way, taking advantage of his boss' trust and the good faith of the reverend who runs the mission that he and Omar just happen to find themselves in. But his best laid plans don't turn out exactly as he thought they would. No one is just what he appears - especially Omar. He's a surprising character.

The Bill Collector is a strange little film. Uneven in texture, it lacks consistency. It requires enormous suspension of disbelief and there are some glitches you could drive a semi through. It's obviously a low budget, personal film. However, once you realize this is not a crime drama/action film but a story of Christian faith and the way God uses the most unlikely people to bring good where evil was the intent, it's hard to deny its charm or turn away from the wacky cast of characters.

Even before I caught on, I watched a good deal of it with a silly little grin on my face - partly because of its improbability and partly because it amused me. For whatever flaws it has, it still delivers a powerful message for those who will hear it.
I liked it. (Everyone won't.)  I was glad I chanced upon it.  Thank you, Danny Trejo, for suckering me into it with your image on the cover.",1417910400,,2142,4.3425

6333345,2,B00J4LMKMW,"I would give this one star if it weren't for the fact that they tried to make a decent movie.  Honestly just horrible in my opinion.  Some might find the underlying Christian theme one that warms the heart.  I'm sorry, to me it seemed forced and contrived and Danny Trejo was about the only good actor in this movie.... meaning his scenes were about all that were believable while everyone else seemed to really not understand how to act in the least.  Bad direction, bad story, bad script, horrible acting and just simply a waste of time.  Sorry, but just bad!",1417651200,,561,4.514851485148514

I won't leave out the possibility.  I have to admit I am a sucker for a Danny Trejo flick.  I don't know what it is about the guy that makes me want to watch his movies.  The unique acting ability he possesses makes any film he is in worth viewing.  In the end, this is a movie with a lot of heart and good messages for living throughout.

I tried again a few weeks later in case I was being too harsh but I only made it to the 15 minute mark.  Combine terrible acting with poor writing and you have this mess.

Don't believe the shills posting reviews here.  Trust the IMDb rating more than Amazon because it really is not a good movie.  After reading through most of the reviews I quickly saw the Christian undertones skewing honest opinion.  I just wish I would have seen this before I started watching.

6333356,1,B00J4LMKMW,"Who doesn't dig B-Movie legend Danny Trejo? That's why I watched. When I realized it wasn't going to be a typical Danny Trejo shoot-em-up, I thought, OK, I can always use a break from that. So then I thought I'd be able to get into this film when the setting turned out to be a Call Center, because it reminded me how much fun working in a crazy Call Center was, and how it used to be a great way for recent college grads, comedians, actors *between jobs* and everyday folks to make an OK income all over the West Coast. No more, that's been outsourced to the Philippines or Bangalore. So back to this very disappointing, badly done movie.

Because The Great Trejo's in it, I'll shout out the positives.  Numero Uno, one, single almost-good card game scene featuring Danny Trejo in a maroon zoot suit! Numero Dos: the movie poster is damned fine.

But not even Don Trejo in a stylin' maroon zoot suit, or my really, really wanting to get into this film because of the whole crazy Call Center thing, none of that could keep me watching. This *dark comedy* ==which was neither funny nor noir-ish== was plagued by mostly terrible acting and an even worse script...which may have been the reason for all the bad acting. Just awful. It was a strong example of what they call ham-fisted writing [or directing, hard to tell which] that also seemed to move the focus artificially to some sort of religious conversion that just didn't seem believable.

I gave it a chance for longer than I should've, and watched  40 very YAWN minutes.  Sad to say, this movie's not even worth it for free.",1415923200,3,1580,4.506993006993007

The cover with Trejo in a black suit holding a pistol is totally misleading, but you are lead into a sweet little moral laden ""feel good movie"".

6333364,2,B00J4LMKMW,"Lorenzo Adams (Gary Ray Moore) works hard for a debt collection agency in Norfolk.

While his boss is gone, Lorenzo comes up with a scam to get money using the collection agency and illegal methods. Lorenzo was a completely unlikeable protagonist in spite of his redemption.

This is a faith based film. I never read about films before I watch them wanting to view them as the director intended, not knowing what it is about, gathering in any surprise that typically are revealed on the reverse of the DVD insert. It is a risk I accept. Had I done that, I would not have watched this film.

The acting and script are marginal. Not much in action scenes as one might surmise by the cover. Plot is extremely improbable.

Both the Hero and Uncle Frankie are debt collectors, although the hero does his debt collecting through a collection agency, and Uncle Frankie does it with threats of violence and muscle. Yes the ""hero"" isn't much of a hero because he is running away from ""Uncle Frankie"" a loan shark played by Mr. Trejo. Even though the hero engineers a scheme to pay off his debt, he ends up helping numerous down on their luck people, including having a positive influence on Uncle Frankie's ""muscle"", ""Omar."" The movie has a lot of very funny situations.  Now for the majestic Mr. Trejo: Not only does he play a slightly comedic part, he gets to dress in expensive suits with his lovely long shiny hair pulled back or hanging freely. My favorite scene was at a poker table with Mr. Trejo dressed in a red suit with a red fedora and his beautiful shiny long hair hanging freely about his shoulders!  This man should take on a modeling career  but I don't know how he'd fit it in with all the time he donates and spends working.  I'd take him either dressed to the nines as he is in this movie, or slightly undressed as we've seen in so many of his other appearances.

6333369,5,B00J4LMKMW,"My wife and I viewed this video last night and were pleasantly surprised.  I expected a retelling of the Gospel story of the Shrewd Manager (Luke 16).  What I didn't expect is an insight to the parable that I had missed all these years.  The ""moral"" of the Gospel story was: ""I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings"".

I had, all these years, concentrated on the manager using dishonest means to gain future employment with the people whose bills he discounted.  Somehow I missed the importance of using the worldly wealth to gain a spiritual reward.  This video demonstrates just how that could be done.  The protagonist is, well, pretty much a jerk.  But his corrupt aim is twisted into a good, almost in spite of himself.  There is redemption at the end, but not in a cloying fashion.

Outstanding performances by The Professor, Omar and Frankie add a great professional touch.  I look forward to viewing other works by the director, as he, like Tolkien, has mastered the ability to teach a Christian moral lesson that is not preachy.",1360713600,,1129,4.680203045685279

Many jokes are made in the business of receivables of collecting with a baseball bat and a gun. However, the most effective techniques used in the movie, by those who had once been down and out themselves was 'listening' and 'empathy'. It is worth viewing the film just to enjoy the approach used by the former literature professor, now debt collector, quoting Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's, ""The Villiage Blacksmith"".
The film is about redemption, but to me, not so much the main character, but all of us, who but for fortune could be in the same situation as the clients of 'Lump Sum Collections'.
