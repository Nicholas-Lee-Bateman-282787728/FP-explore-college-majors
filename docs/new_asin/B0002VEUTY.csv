2124417,4,B0002VEUTY,"I just got back from seeing ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" in a sold out theater and it seemed like everyone loved it. This is the easily Vin Diesel's best role as it was playing the same character in ""Pitch Black."" The story is a little too detailed for this type of film, but it actually makes the film seem more for us people with an IQ of at least 100, which is much better than seeing a pure brainless Sci-Fi affair. There is some comedy (Diesel has some great one-liners) and the Special Effects are very good. The 100 Million dollar price tag on this film obviously went to Vin Diesel and the SFX. I was worried the PG-13 would detract from the enjoyment I had of actually seeing a little gore like in ""Pitch Black,"" but the action scenes were full of so much energy and Diesel's powerful movements that I did not miss all the blood and guts that really were not needed in this movie. So in short, grab a few of your friends and head to see this Sci-Fi/Action Adventure while it is still on the Big Screen!",1086912000,17,1010,4.265625
2124418,3,B0002VEUTY,"Fight scenes substitute for coherent storyline in this sci-fi action pic.  As an ardent follower of the sci-fi movie genre, I also really liked Pitch Black, the movie Riddick is supposedly a sequel to.  But the connection to P.B. is a very loose one (Vin Diesel's Riddick encounters a couple of fellow survivors from the previous movie).  And this ""sequel"" is radically different than Pitch Black in many ways.  It's basically a space opera with a lone good guy (Diesel) fighting against an evil overlord, ala Star Wars.  There is very little suspense - we know the movie will end with a showdown between the two main characters - and what there is of a plot is pretty convoluted and muddled.
I gave this flick 3 stars only because some of the sci-fi ideas and effects are interesting and imaginative.  (Although one of the effects I liked, the wraithlike Elemental and the head bad guy's ability to turn ghostly, was done better in the 2nd Matrix movie.)  Overall, though, it was a pretty disappointing letdown from Pitch Black.",1086912000,3,1029,4.747191011235955
2124419,4,B0002VEUTY,"Do you like to look for holes and idiosyncrasies in plots of movies? Well, then this may not be the movie for you. My wife is that type of person, and after the movie, she could not stop talking about the plot holes. Yes, there are many.

Now, do you like all out action sci-fi a'la Fifth Element and Independence Day? Then you will love this movie. It has everything you could ask for. Tons of futuristic gadgetry, multiple planets capes, space battles and great production values. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and cleverly edited. The sound removed and replace with high-octane drum and bongo tracks. Yes, I know it does not sound good, but trust me it works.

I will liken Vin Diesels performance to that of Keanu Reeves in The Matrix. That is- he has very little dialog and the lines he does have are exactly that: one-liners. He does a great job by just using his presence.

I highly recommend this film. Just leave your wife at home.",1086912000,2,955,4.508670520231214
2124420,3,B0002VEUTY,"Well I got to see an advanced screener of this so the review I am writing is on what I have seen and not necessarily what the finished product will be.  The direction was very good.  The action sequences pace the whole movie not too fast but not too slow.  Vin Diesel delivers countless one liners which is good for his acting ability.  Lets face it he is a great action movie actor but i don't expect him delivering shakespearian monologues.  The Lord marshal was played really well he is a bad guy you love to hate and you hope for his demise.  Lord Vaako the aspiring underling is also done really well.
This is going to be a movie that is going to rely on its action adventure and special effects to get it by on most counts.  The story line had quite a bit to be desired.  It showed us a glimpse of the necromonger religion but made you wonder about its apparent hierarchy.  Like in a society of Drone soldiers what is the Purpose of Lady Vaako to Lord Vaako especially since to replenish troops they convert conquered armies.  Also the elementals are a race where you wonder how much interaction with the necromongers there was previously since there is some sort of respect for that race and a disregard for all others.  Also the Furians the race that Riddick is decended from,  he has dreams suggesting that he reunite with his other furians and take revenge on those that destroyed his people. however the furian contingency doesn't appear as they had tried to foreshadow it in the movie.  Oh and the cliff scene were the sun comes up on the cliffs but then it is dark 10 seconds later on the other side and stays dark just was really unbelivable.  cut part of the cliff scene and just leave someone behind and cut back to it later.  it really screws up the sense of timing for the upcoming sunrise.  The ending also had alot to be desired and i am figuring that is why they were test screening the movie so early.  What I wouldn't give to have a day with the writers and let them know How I think this movie could be soo much better.  from what I saw this is going to be a good movie on action and special effects however unless they make some change the plot isn't gonna win them picture of the year.  But I sometimes think that we as a society don't expect great things from an action movie anymore.  (...)",1081382400,22,2318,4.309468822170901
2124443,5,B0002VEUTY,"who knew?  now i know why everyone likes Vin Diesel.  I love science fiction,  the wilder the better.  The second film is better than the first,  I think, but i saw it first so...  this one is good too.  fun,  imaginative,  violence but not like .. disturbing that I recall.  big adventure and this guy is a bad ass hero from another planet where they apparently talk alot like we do!",1517097600,,384,4.28169014084507
2124444,5,B0002VEUTY,"I am a fan of Sci-Fi and I found this movie to be very good. I purchased the BluRay version for my video library. The quality of the video and sound was excellent. I also purchased a VUDU HDX streaming video version to play on our familys Apple and Android products. I also streamed it to our digital projector onto a 12 foot diagonal screen and the quality was impressive.

I owned the DVD version of the film and I wanted the directors cut on BluRay. There are some slight variations in the movies but the presentation was still entertaining and fun to watch.

Vin Diesel does a good job in this film playing the role of the super bad convict from the planet Furyan.  The film features him as the villain and the hero and as the only chance to save the human race.

There is a lot of action in this film, as you would suspect, and that made it entertaining for me. I enjoyed the Sci-Fi part of the film and the look into the spacecraft and weapons used by the warriors and other fighters. For me it was a good film and I enjoyed it. I would say though that I liked the movie Pitch Black better.

I am glad I added it into my video collection.",1516752000,2,1144,4.158371040723982

riddicks' story is crazy but it's the other themes that tie me to this movie as well as character progression.
The depth and attention to detail to the Necromongers is amazing.
Vaako, what a baddass, a true believer, who has achieved transcendence.
Riddick wasn't a bad movie but was basically pitch black 2.0, which dissapointed me.

I need to see Riddick transcend the underverse to become the holy half dead grand marshall of the Necromongers. Both the end of chronicles and the extended ending on Riddick teased this... please Vin",1498176000,,566,5.0212765957446805

It's always a curiosity to me why gothic sci-fi adventures like this often dress up in medieval cloaks, or employ Nazi overtones for the bad guys, etc.  There's ample reputable precedent, of course, from Star Wars to LOTR to Matrix (""Matrices"" ??).  and it's well-done here, too.

2124649,3,B0002VEUTY,"It's still pretty Riddickulous, but at least this director's cut makes more sense than the shortened theatrical release. The reinstated scenes don't add much length, but they do explain some plot points that were terribly murky in the original. Both versions are silly. The Underverse is a dopey concept in either version, Colm Fiore is badly miscast as the dark overlord, Riddick fiddles way too often with his goggles in both, and a lot of the dialogue is painful. (Best line in the movie: ""If I owned this place and Hell, I'd rent this place out and live in Hell."") Still, it has an awesomely Rococo over-the-top design, like Dune on meth, and if you like sci-fi action flicks it can be goofy fun. Diesel has made far worse movies, like the hideous bad sequel to this one.",1456012800,4,775,4.6231884057971016

Riddick just isn't the save the world type, for any reason.

However, I make an exception in this case.  I have started to make it a habit of finding the director's cut or unrated versions of movies.  I had only seen Chronicles of Riddick on cable and did not realize what I was missing.  This widescreen version has maybe 9 or 10 extra minutes of material which makes a BIG difference in the story line and fills some gaps in the story.  There are flash-backs to prophecy which explains more of Riddick's past.  There is an entire section where at the hangar where Riddick has some sort of power surge and wipes out almost all of Necromongers.  This explains how he got left behind instead of killed and it also explains Lord Vaco's respect for Riddick.  These small snippets help flesh out the story better.",1444348800,,912,4.484848484848484

Why do I feel like most of his movies contain his line, ""you made three mistakes; one, you came after me, two you came alone... for ME, are you f-ing crazy? Three ..[depends on what the movie concerns]"". Like Bruce Willis, Vin Diesel has to get his ""I'm cool, I'm bad"" lines in most movies. I look past those, and the movie is not bad; Diesel always proves to have a heart and be the actual good guy.  If you're familiar with any of the Riddick films, I'd say Pitch Black was better.

2124809,3,B0002VEUTY,"Chronicles of Riddick is one of those sequels like Highlander 2: The Quickening, where you wonder why they needed to make a sequel. After all, Pitch Black was never anything great. It was a sleeper hit that they should've let alone, or at best, if they had to make a sequel, why did they have to make Chronicles? Chronicles is watchable in a tongue-in-cheek way. The dialogue, costumes, names and plot are silly. The film tries so hard to be cool: ""Necromongers"" ""Lens him out and cleanse him"" ""You keep what you kill"" ""Quasi-Deads."" You laugh and cringe when the actors have to say their lines without smirking.

Chronicles also suffers from the fatal error of more is more. Hollywood decided to give Riddick the huge budget it supposedly deserved, based on nothing more than the mild cult status of Pitch Black. So here we go: make it all bigger, badder, over the top. Instead of a tight, focused flick like Pitch Black, let's expand this thing into a galaxy-sized smorgasbord on par w/Star Wars and Star Trek. Include an array of races and tech and some kind of abstract concept like Underverse, tons of locations, ships, people. Chronicles gets out of hand fast and is crushed by its own weight.

If you happened to see the third and final Riddick (creatively titled ""Riddick"") you will be pleasantly surprised. It's entertaining, worlds better than Chronicles, because it keeps it tight and falls back to the smaller structure of Pitch Black, fewer characters, one planet, one plot. It's well done.

Despite my complaints, Chronicles is decent. It's pure escapist shlock I'll probably watch again if it's on tv.",1405900800,,1616,4.8267148014440435

Excellent story(if you can under stand it) reminds me of ""Dune"" this movie is completely another scale from ""Bitch Black"" or the new ""Riddick"" movie.  Your dealing with the entire Universe and pertaining to another place called ""Under-verse"" which is referenced but never visited. Riddick, as usual deals alot with mercs, and outside the confilct with the necromongers and their deep and complex backstory, he is mostly what he was in ""Pitch Black"" and the new movie, a smasher of merc heads(or more creatively done so). I was most fascinated with this movie however I like all of them and the two computer games as well which tie in with the Riddick story.  Chronicles is a much deeper story than just mercs or monsters unlike the prequel or the sequel. If you like Pitch Black or ""Riddick"" you may find this a little weird if not, it is the best movie of the three.  Though ""Riddick"" has some added scenes to tie this movie with that one, it is another ""Pitch Black"" on a wasteland with mercs.",1405382400,,1150,4.678217821782178

2124818,5,B0002VEUTY,"It is 5 years following the adventure in Pitch Black and Riddick finds himself up against the Lord Marshall and his army of Necromongers who seek to convert or kill mankind.

Riddick is approached by Aereon (Judi Dench), leader of Helion's ""elementals,"" who pleads with him to aid them in their fight against the Necromongers

Hoping to learn of his past as a member of the Furion race, Riddick agrees. Along the way he is briefly reunited with Jack Badd (Alexa Davalos), the runaway he saved in Pitch Black who now goes by the name Kyra.

Hungry for power, Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) plots to use Riddick to help eliminate the Lord Marshal and thereby elevate her consort Commander Vaako (Karl Urban) as the new leader of the Necromongers.

I have loved the Riddick movies since Pitch Black.

Vin Diesel does a terrific job in his portrayal of the character and is supported by an excellent cast including Judi Dench, Karl Urban and Colm Feore.

The special effects are outstanding as is the stunts and choreography of the fight scenes.

The only issue I had was with the DVD itself. When playing in my Panasonic DVD player, it will only play with the audio commentary on (rather annoying). This occurred in both Convert and Fight option. I found no way to turn this off.

2124840,5,B0002VEUTY,"This is such great classic sci fi, it's hard to believe it is from 2004.  Vin Diesel was born for this role.  This is one of my favorite all time movies, the opening scene gets your heart pounding and it just doesn't stop:  almost non-stop action from there on out.  Costume, set design, all top notch and the acting is excellent too!  If you think about the plot, it gets a little sad, be like his character, stick to action.

Also, somehow, the movie is composed almost entirely of excellent one-liners.  Must be Vin Diesel's excellent, yet under-appreciated, acting.  ""It's a tea cup, actually."" He makes the statement ""29.4 kilometers"" sinister and hilarious at the same time.  Truly amazing.  The action really does distract away from his acting, so Mr. Diesel, there are those of us that do appreciate both your ability in your stunts, who enjoy your material, who do also appreciate that it does distract, but without the excellent acting, the stunts are just stunts.

The entire movie, however, is moving poetry.  Thandie Newton nearly steals the show from him.  The Purifier is mysterious and sad and one of the best death scenes ever.  I have been a fan of Karl Urban since his Xena (Eros/Caesar) days (hope he plays Erak in the rumored production of The Ranger's Apprentice), his character is so powerful and so pious, yet so mixed up and impotent.  The set design is truly other wordly and the first time I saw the Lord Marshall and he removed his face covering I nearly fainted!  So creepy!  This is one of the best done movies ever.

2124848,5,B0002VEUTY,"Does anyone know why critics hate this movie? I can't see why.

The sequel to Pitch Black redefines this series with the kind of power and expansion that makes a movie universe great.
I don't know where to begin with this film, between the designs, the planets, and the characters, I'd just say buy and watch it.
Theres to much to talk about and not enough space to give my testimony, so i'll put it in a retrospect as short as possible:
-The Characters: Some are developed really well, some not, and some not at all
-The Plot: It's an awesome concept, event though it gets a little messy half way through the film, before it refocuses for the final act
-The Details: Beautifully designed and rendered, the Riddick-verse is a true mark of imagination
-The Script: So-So, despite good writing in some areas, it drops off a few times

And in the end, Riddick is contender for the next Star Wars, and it's easily 77%-
Expanding on the Universe that made the first installment great, The Chronicles of Riddick redefines it's own series and takes the audience for one hell of a ride, even if it doesn't impress a certain horde of tasteless critics.",1392422400,,1143,4.570731707317073

The story is both deceptively simple and outrageously complicated.  The only thing everyone agrees on is ""catch Riddick and kill Riddick.""  A pack of bounty hunters is on his trail, twice.  There are marauding Necromongers rampaging through the solar system (apparently any solar system, take your pick).  An Elemental pops up to confuse things further (no wonder she's wispy, her character is totally insubstantial.  An incredible waste of Judi Dench's considerable talent).  And surprise, Riddick may or may not be a Furyan (who-what-where and since when!?).  There are also half-dead telepaths called Quasi-Dead (sure, why not, the more the merrier) wandering around.  Naturally, there's a prophecy involving a child who spells DOOM for the Lord Marshal (played with one facial expression by Colm - does this helmet make me look like a fathead - Feore.  There are schemes galore, backstabbing (literally), conspiracies, and some gobbledygook about some place or state of mind called Underverse.  Lost in the midst of all this excess is Vin Diesel.

They are powerful, have overwhelming numbers, and are feared by everyone. A few scenes with Dame Judi Dench are worth noting also as I am a fan of hers.

But you have to give credit for trying! The fact that Jack was involved in acting AND directing, the good cast and the recreation of the period. It was a GOOD follow up.  But you stuck through it because of Jake/Jack!!  You really liked the actor/character!!

Now, like ""The Two Jakes"", ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was a good, not great, follow up. Not nearly as great or original as it's predecessor.  They tried to come up with a story to TOP the original and, while giving them an ""A"" for effort for all the special effects and costumes, the story train certainly went off the rails, took some dirt roads and treaded a little water(which ain't easy for a train) to JUMP BACK ON the rails and try to end it with some modicum of coherence.

2124947,3,B0002VEUTY,"Riddick is one of my favorite anti-heroes. The first movie introduced a new character I could really get behind. Reminded me of my child hood and the juxtaposition i found myself in realizing that two of my favorite star wars characters were essentially 'bad guys', they of course being Darth Vader and Boba Fett. (OT of course).

The quote 'you are either on my side or in my way...' rings very clearly for Riddick. The lifer convict who has spent so much time in the 'slams' that he had a prison doctor do a surgical shine job on his eyes so he could see in the dark was simply awesome to me. It raised so many other questions as a back story, I mean what kind of person would be able to subject themselves to an eye surgery in prison like he would if he were getting a prison tattoo?  Riddick that's who. Just that knowledge alone makes scenes like resetting a broken arm with a slight look of discomfort on his face all the more in character. In short, loved the character and couldn't wait to see what future adventures awaited.

Enter The Chronicles. Take everything I wrote above and toss it out the window as it never applied. Basically a character re write on the level of an infant superman fleeing krypton. I also found the whole concept of the necromongers completely over kill, from the gothic ships and armor to the story of the underverse, it just didn't seem to fit the original movie in tone or scope. I didn't hate the chronicles, far from it, I was just disappointed in the direction Twohy went with the character.

Hopefully the new Riddick coming out soon we'll get back to the basics and loose the super hero overtones present in the sequel.",1383004800,,1663,4.4605263157894735

In many ways, this was better than the original but both are fun movies to watch and Vin Diesel did a great job in helping to create this anti-hero.

2124964,4,B0002VEUTY,"This review is targeted towards the people who know what ""lawful evil"" and ""neutral evil"" mean in the D&D sense.  (As Diesel was a former player, I think its relevant as he produced this movie...)

Evil campaigns (where the protagonists are bad guys pursuing their own ""evil"" agendas) are really designed to try to explore characters and moral conflicts from a completely different perspective.  We're all socialized to cheer for the good guys, but campaigns on this kind of theme put the characters in the position where all options are ""evil.""

Riddick comes off as a textbook ""neutral evil,"" and in this story--in fact what I believe to the point of the entire film--is to contrast that alignment type with the lawful evil that make up the Necromongers.  And the evil of the prison guards.  And the Mercenaries.  (All various neutral types.)

Most people who don't consider this will probably write off Riddick as simply a ""tough guy"" who's really a ""good guy.""  (Considering the fact that he willingly goes to prison in order to break out ""Jack."")  There's definitely a hint of some kind of code of honor in there, but putting both this one and ""Pitch Black"" into plain view, its clear he doesn't attach an automatic value to any human life but his own.

That's really about all I can say... I can't read 400+ reviews, and if you managed to read this far, feel free to say this review helped you if it made you consider the film from a different angle.",1381622400,,1456,4.6484375

This movie is not as good as the first one, but I give it 5 stars because at least try to be that good and don't fail completely at it. Maybe the necromongers don't look as scary as the ""monsters"" of the first one and that's why I didn't like it that much.

Uh, no, Pitch Black doesn't have a plot in comparison.  This movie is EPIC.  Not exactly original but epic nonetheless.  Extremely underrated, sadly.

I understand how some people could be upset that Riddick does actually have a heart in this sequel to Pitch Black.  It does take away from the antihero that is Riddick, but not much.  He's still pretty heartless with little redeeming values.

My favorite part of this movie is the ending.  I won't give it away if you haven't seen it, but it's one of those endings that I always want but never get.  This time I got it....and LOVED it.

2124977,3,B0002VEUTY,"Here's a surprise, I actually liked this movie a bit better than I recall the first time around.  I'm not sure why.  Perhaps it was the unrated version that I watched.  It added 14 minutes to the theatrical cut and although I'm not sure what was added (or deleted), the story (still ridiculous) seemed to flow better.  Perhaps it was because I've gotten Riddickmania recently having re-watched 2000's ""Pitch Black"" (still the best), the animated ""Dark Fury"" (2004) and the new ""Riddick"" (2013).

Riddick (Vin Diesel) abandons his loner status in ""Chronicles"" agreeing to help some ghostly species (Judi Dench, earning a paycheck) fight off the Necromongers who are taking over the Universe, one planet at a time.  The invading `mongers are led by the evil Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) and his hunky commander Vaako (Karl Urban).  Vaako is married to Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton, hamming it up for all she's worth) who is one of those wives that pushes her hubby into power, clamoring for it herself.

The planet currently being taken over also houses the Imam (Keith David) who is one of the 3 survivors from ""Pitch Black.""  He's now married and has a cute pre-teen daughter.  Of course she brings out a trace of Riddick's humanity.  The other survivor if you recall was Jack, the pubescent boy/girl Riddick outed.  She's now a very hot (and not just sweaty hot) prisoner located on/in a foreboding planet called Crematoria where it hits 300F degrees.  She's now known as Kyra (Alexa Davalos) and is really pissed at Riddick for abandoning her years ago to go do whatever it is Riddick does between films.

Riddick is eventually and conveniently captured by some mercs and sent to the same prison.  All of this becomes a bit convoluted perhaps with the purpose of showing off Riddick/Diesel's muscles.  And while the production is certainly bigger and in some ways better, some of the CGI also looks fairly primitive.  Landscapes for example.  While I don't think this ""Riddick"" is terrible, it's not great either.  It does have an ending that pretty much sets up the new (2013) film.

2124992,4,B0002VEUTY,"The Chronicles of Riddick, in my opinion, is a highly underrated sequel.  I admit when I first saw the film as a kid I did not care for it.  I thought the film was quite boring, especially the middle portion.  However I gave the film another chance and now I really enjoy the film.  It is not as good as Pitch Black but is still a kickass film.  Riddick is still awesome, the effects are amazing, the fights are great, and I even like the story.

The film takes place sometime after Pitch Black.  Riddick (Vin Diesel) is still a wanted criminal.  He makes his way to the planet called Helion and meets Imam (Keith David), the priest from Pitch Black.  We are then introduced to this race of aliens called the Necromongers who are determined to wipeout humanity across the universe.  Riddick now has to find some way to stop them.

This film is not quite as enjoyable as Pitch Black.  One main reason is that the cast is not as good.  Riddick is still badass, but he is the only character I really like.  Keith David's character, (who I liked in Pitch Black) is killed off very early in the film.  You also have this annoying girl in the film that was actually in Pitch Black named Kyra.  In Pitch Black she was a little girl who admired Riddick and wanted to be just like him.  In this film she is more grown up and still wants to be like Riddick.  I did not really care for her character in Pitch Black and I do not care for her here either.

Another problem is that the middle portion can get boring.  During the middle of the film Riddick gets captured and put on this prison planet which is where he meets Kyra.  The parts on the prison planet just drag on a bit too long in my opinion.  The middle portion of Pitch Black dragged as well, but you had likable characters that made seemed less draggy.  Here the only likable character is Riddick.

This film does have a lot of good points though which is why I like the film.  Again, Riddick is awesome and it is nice to see him kicking ass again.  We also learn a bit more about Riddick like a bit where he comes from.  The effects are amazing.  They are even better than Pitch Black.  I will even say that the effects in this film rival the Star Wars prequels.  The Necromongers I think are cool villains.  A love their design and goal and power makes them a real threat.  I love the fight scenes in the film especially the final fight.  Action upped tenfold from Pitch Black.  While I did not really care for the stuff with the prison planet, I have to admit when Riddick and Kyra are making their escape it is a fun scene.

Overall, if you are a fan of Pitch Black, then definitely give this a look.  I suggest you watch Pitch Black before this film or you will be lost.  It is a fun movie with a great main character, great effects, and great action.",1378598400,,2807,4.228301886792453
2124993,1,B0002VEUTY,"Vin Diesel did well in the movie ""Pitch Black,"" where he had a limited role and didn't say very much (he just ran around in the background and looked tough). Vin Diesel is only capable of playing secondary characters. When you try to put Vin Diesel front in center, Diesel's limits as an actor crack open and glare up.

A good metaphor is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold was good as the terminator, because all he had to do was look awesome and say a few one liners. However, any movie where Arnold actually tries to be the lead actor and depict a real character with complexity--the film is forgettable. Similarly, all the movies Vin Diesel have made other than Pitch Black are really bad.

In this film, Riddick said he was ""a monster"" and on and on about how bad he is. A real ""bad dude"" would not say these things about himself once, let alone over and over again. There are other wildly stupid dialogue flaws. The dialogue destroyed the mystique of the character as well as the quality of the film.

The choice of making Vin Diesel as the lead was bad enough. The dialogue was a nail in the coffin.",1378598400,,1101,4.4405940594059405

It is just make believe, but for 2 hrs. and a bowl of popcorn I really enjoyed myself.

2125014,3,B0002VEUTY,"That pun cannot be avoided. This film is absolutely crazy. But I have to admit that it is enjoyable in a weird sort of way. When you swing for the fences and throw everything possible into a film, the end product is bound to have some virtues amidst its chaos, and that is true of The Chronicles of Riddick.

First of all, it is nothing like Pitch Black, aside from Riddick himself and a couple of other returning characters. Pitch Black was a tight, intimate story in the vein of Alien. Chronicles is an over-the-top epic space fantasy, kind of crazy attempt at a Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings experience. There are plenty of derivative elements and eye-rolling names (Necromongers, Quasi-Grotto, Crematoria), and there is plenty of shamelessly grandstanding dialog and arch-overacting. And what the heck is Judi Dench doing in this film?

However, the complete lack of restraint winds up being the saving grace of Chronicles. It is a fantasy gone wild, and in that, a wild adventure that is watchable in spite of its ridiculousness. As the Amazon review says, David Twohy has created a B-movie here, but possibly the most ambitiously insane B-movie ever.

And this film has some of the most incredible production design that I have ever seen in any film. The Necromonger sets and costumes, in particular the Basilica Ship, are sheerly overwhelming in their ornate grandeur. And darkly creepy as well - this is not a cute film. Visually, this film although a bit uneven, is something to see. Just don't expect another Pitch Black.",1377561600,2,1535,4.806818181818182

2125016,5,B0002VEUTY,One of Vin Diesel's best movies. I like his other Fast Furious movies but as Riddick this it the Best!,1377129600,2,102,4.15
2125017,2,B0002VEUTY,"Wow, where to start with this one. OK, first of all, if something that I am complaining about was explained in some other source material, a comic, a cartoon, a long lost radio show? I don't care. For me this was a live action movie and it needed to be able to have some ability to stand on its own, at least within the realm of its predecessor, ""Pitch Black"". Now, down to business.

This movie is about Riddick. He's a bad, bad man. As shown in ""Pitch Black"", Riddick is an escaped convict who can see in the dark and, because of years spent fighting for his very survival in the worst hell-hole prisons, is the most capable killer the universe has ever known. In ""Pitch Black"" he saves two people out of a whole ship load from horrible monsters that come out of the darkness to devour them. It was simple, to the point, and though not brilliant, was a decent piece of entertainment.

Here, Riddick is more of a hyper-real version of the character we used to know. He is now the ""child of prophesy"" who will destroy the ""Necromongers"". Necromongers are world destroyers who worship death and want to reach the ""Underverse"". They even sacrifice their mortal lives to convert to the Necromonger religion. What is the Underverse? How can the already-dead warriors be killed by Riddick if they are already dead? Who cares?! Time for an action scene! *punch* *kick* *thud*

The Necromongers are led by the Lord Marshal, played by Colm Feore, who was chilling as the demonic ""Linoge"" in Stephen King's ""Storm of the Century"". Here his job seems to be to smirk, walk around in uncomfortable looking plastic armor, and collect a check. But, I digress. Playing the Lord Marshal's second-in-command is the wonderful actor, Karl Urban. Wonderful elsewhere actually, as here he seems so unsure of who his character is, how he feels, or what his motivation is that he acts more like a schizophrenic off his meds than a solid person. That is not entirely his fault because the script has him bouncing around like a wad of flubber.

Trying to convince Riddick to follow his destiny is an ""Elemental"", played by Dame Judi Dench. Why, Dame Dench? Oh, why did you lower yourself to be in this schlock? *sigh* Some questions are better left unanswered. As far as I can tell, Elementals are non-corporeal humans who are beyond our realm of physical reality and hold great power, but for some reason need a silver-eyed convicted murderer to take care of the Lord Marshal because for some reason they can't get directly involved. They can also be held by physical chains even though they don't have to hold physical form. Why? How? Huh? Who cares?! *kick**thud*

Since the story doesn't make any sense, let us lose ourselves in the action sequences. But here we are groaning and smacking our hands to our heads in frustration as well. Is it a law that when bad guys have a clear advantage and advanced weaponry that they have to do hand to hand combat with sticks and knives? At one point Riddick is trapped in a pit on the enemy ship. The guards in the balconies are ordered to kill and him, and rather than, I don't know, pull out a gun and shoot him, they dive into the pit and get slaughtered like sheep. And why did Riddick walk willingly into that pit to begin with? He had time to make good his escape. Think, movie, think!

In another scene someone FINALLY thinks to shoot Riddick and while he's on his knees helpless, a spirit/memory/whatever the heck she is, shows up and touches his chest which, for some reason, causes him to be able to emit a giant weaponized pulse from his body that flattens the enemy soldiers. How can he do this? Why doesn't he do it later in the movie when the Lord Marshal is kicking the tar out of him? Nothing? Here's a hint, movie; we need there to be a REASON for ACTIONS to HAPPEN. Otherwise you are just letting the ""Plot Convenience Fairy"" run amok on your screenplay.

Then there is his sidekick, Kyra. I won't even go in to her personal history because at this point I don't care anymore, but suffice it to say that the movie sets her up as pretty much a female version of Riddick. Why is it then that this incredibly dangerous and capable young woman succumbs to ""Disney Damsel"" syndrome in which a previously established strong female character becomes a simpering wimp at the whim of the screenplay just so the male lead can save her? When fleeing from prison she ends up last in the line of escapees at just the wrong moment even though she was A: right behind Riddick the whole time and B: she is obviously in way better shape than any of the other convicts. This of course is so Riddick will have to save her so he can show his ""good guy side"". Never mind the fact that he comes away from direct contact with a type of solar heat that has already set fire to a man and he doesn't even get a sunburn. Oh, that's right. He dumped a half a canteen of warm water on his head before he got in the sun, so it's OK.

There is one, and only one, half believable shot in the movie. That is the scene where Riddick is hanging by a rope deep within the prison planet and he uses his agility and strength to cleverly break his manacles. It was far-fetched, but more in working with the character than almost any other scene in the movie.

This movie was terrible. It did not make sense even in its own universe. The stretches of logic and the outrageous plot conveniences we are asked to accept would have made the writers of any given James Bond movie blush. I didn't even get into the pillaging of other sci-fi canon or the idiotic terminology like the fire planet being named ""Crematoria"". That's like the hard to obtain metal in ""Avatar"" being named ""Unobtanium"". This movie wasn't even bad enough to be funny, it was just a dull and nonsensical bore, and it insulted me just to watch it. Do yourself a favor; watch the far superior ""Pitch Black"" and forget this movie was ever made.",1377043200,,5906,4.466172381835032

For example scenes not included as extras, but in HBO version: Scene with girl in prison in very early part of movie, full sequence of the invasion and reason the imam gets killed, communication between the heir apparent and his wife in different star systems confirming Riddick's importance, and most importantly the fullest sequence of the geas girl of the Furyians and the geas laid upon Furyians, etc for much more.

We also enjoyed, not that we're big into these kinds of things - the way they filmed this.

First thing is first, if you don't like sci-fi, action, fun, muscles or general bad assery you need not read further or watch this movie. Chronicles is a movie you should not go into with expectations of award winning acting or tear jerking character development. Chronicles is a movie that will both make you laugh because of it's absurdity, i.e. Riddick ripping off his goggles for dramatic effect every .5 seconds and also draw you into its imaginative futuristic universe full of action and adventure. Don't look too deep for plot, because you won't have to dig to far, but there is just enough to be entertaining and fun (in the case if the theatrical release the plot is convoluted and can be hard to follow so stay away from it).

2125065,2,B0002VEUTY,"The Chronicles of Riddick ruins the momentum Pitch Black carried. In CoR, solid character development went out the window. You can tell the director's focus went from good story and character development in Pitch Black, to cool special effects. Don't get me wrong, Chronicles of Riddick LOOKED cool, but as a story, it was cheesy and forgettable. Furyans? Necromongers? C'mon. The movie went waaaaaay overboard with it's universe. I like sci-fi movies with broad universes, but not to the point where they're just throwing in random species and places. And since when can Riddick fight off a whole army and walk away without a scratch? I know it's a movie, but some realism would be nice. That's what made Pitch Black such a classic. I would love to see Pitch Black with Chronicle of Riddick's effects. If you're new to the franchise, I suggest you see Pitch Black and avoid this movie. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it definitely put a cloud over the Riddick franchise.",1351728000,,986,4.805882352941176

2125078,4,B0002VEUTY,"""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is a very watchable Sci-Fi action movie that is the last in the Riddick series (following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pitch-Black-Blu-ray/dp/B001RTCP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pitch Black  [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Fury-The-Chronicles-of-Riddick-Animated/dp/B0001O3YA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Fury - The Chronicles of Riddick (Animated)</a>). While it does have a few characters from the the first two movies, it could almost stand on its own since the back-story really isn't too important to the main plot line.

No spoilers from me; Vin Diesel reprises his role as the fugitive Riddick, a very tough, no nonsense survivalist in the truest sense of the word. There are a lot of new elements added the Riddick universe, including a few new races, and issues much grander in scope than the previous movies. While Riddick is a very cold killer who is capable of explosive violence, he also is very loyal to those he considers worthwhile.

The special effects are very impressive in places and I really liked the feel of the environments created for the movie, with some of the Necromonger technology being the creepiest I have ever seen. The various fight scenes are all well done and are some of the best in any movie in this genre.

Recommended!

2125080,4,B0002VEUTY,"I've read several reviews for this film, but only a few seem to truly understand the subtle allegory of the plot itself. Bear with me, now. Don't write my interpretation off as ""reading into"" the film until you've read further and watched the film with all this in mind.  From the first opening shot of a three-faced statue subtly alluding to the Christian Trinity, to the Necromongers, who are dressed like stylized medieval Crusaders, taking over a Muslim city, the allegory within Chronicles of Riddick plunders its images from Christian history and theology.

The Chronicles of Riddick is a sci-fi retelling of the Catholic Church's Crusades against the Muslims during the middle ages.  Clearly, the director is offering plenty of criticism of the Catholic church: the dogmatic authority of the pope (represented by the Lord Marshall), the misguided militarism of forced conversion, and the apparent morbidity of a worldview that hopes for a life after death.  In Riddick, we see Christianity through the eyes of its enemies.

But what about Riddick himself?  As I watched his character unfold, I realized that this movie was not about CONDEMNING Christianity, but REFORMING it.  Riddick is a highly-structured Christ figure in the vein of Neo (from the Matrix).  He has been prophesied to restore the balance of evil and good (and is himself portrayed as ""evil"" but not in the diabolical sense found in Scripture, but in the dynamic sense found in Nietszche).

Plenty of Biblical images are assigned to Riddick. From the Old Testament, we see Moses-like Riddick lead exiles out of captivity. We see him survive in a den of alien lions in imitation of Daniel. As an infant, he has survived a slaughter of the innocents, as did both Moses and Christ.  The final scenes show Riddick assuming his Messianic Role: he ""dies"" and returns to the living.  He descends into Hell (a burning planet called Crematoria), he fights and defeats the Lord Marshall (the pope) and assumes the throne of leadership (Christ as the true head of the Church).  Strangely, the movie ends there and does not explain whether Riddick reforms the Necromonger religion (as Martin Luther did) or whether he abolishes it and replaces it with something else (as Christ did with Judaism).

One thing is certain, though.  This is no ordinary action movie.  Watch it again and see if you can disagree.",1290988800,7,2370,4.964556962025316

2125084,4,B0002VEUTY,"This is the third installment in the ""Riddick"" series, keep in mind the 2nd installment was a vague attempt at a filler story to give a little follow-up story to the characters from Pitch Black and basically introduce the character ""Toombs"" so his appearance and apparent relationship with Riddick in this movie doesn't seem completely out of nowhere leaving the viewer feeling like they missed something... Van Helsing did the same thing.

Anyways the movie is ok... personally I don't feel they needed to really clarify the Riddick character that much since the mystique of the character is kind of what I liked about him. I also felt the Goku/Frieza Dragonball Z aspect (if you're a DBZ fan you'll know it as soon as it comes up in the movie) feels out of place and the Conan moment near the end of the movie feels like they left the movie unfinished and are planning another sequel.

Anyways the movie in my opinion is worth a watch, but I honestly liked Pitch Black more. Sure this one is newer, has better production quality and a ton of explosions but it's just my personal preference.

I've seen some reviews on the 2-for-1 pack complaining that their movie locks up on their blu-ray for the ""director's cut"" but mine played fine and I have a cheap POS blu-ray player that doesn't even support firmware updates.

2125090,3,B0002VEUTY,"Chronicles of Riddick: 6 out of 10: This movie reminded me very much of Dune. Not because of the opulent sets and costumes but simply because for the first 30 minutes or so I had absolutely no idea what was going on.

Now keep in mind I saw and loved the previous film Pitch Black (And if there was any justice in Hollywood Pitch Black star Rahda Mitchell would be getting 20 million dollar paychecks and Van Diesel would be doing walk on roles in Colin Farrell vehicles) and I saw that 30-minute anime that was supposed to fill in the plot (needless to say it doesn't).

The film Dune was criticized for its ponderous 15 minute opening narration and while I wouldn't inflict that particular torture on any other movie some idea of what is going on was clearly in order. Chronicles of Riddick on the other hand starts of mired in confusion. Even for those that had seen the previous film(s).

It then quickly hits a low point with seizure inducing battle flashes and a little girl melting Riddick's heart in a scene right out of the Grinch that Stole Christmas. But as soon as I was reaching for the eject button the movie strangely morph's into Alien 3 (or Star Trek VI the Undiscovered Country take your pick.)

See Riddick was going to save Jack the twelve year old girl who pretended to be a boy and now looks and dresses like a supermodel because she is safely located in an otherwise all male prison. Yeah that one kind of lost me too. However the action scenes pick up again and enough back story drifts in so that the biblical/Shakespearian plot comes into focus.

You see Riddick was born on a planet called Krypton, and then he was placed in the reeds to escape the pharaoh or was it King Herod'. anyway the guy married to Lady MacBeth. No! Not the one with the Billy Ray Cyrus mullet. He was Lady MacBeth's lover Lancelot. See clear as day.

Sure the bad guy wears that mask from Amadeus and his troops look like Gwar started a dance troop. But many of the sets and costumes carry the day. The special effects are very well done (with the possible exception of the CGI Hellhounds) and the music certainly could have been worse.

The basic problem is the three main characters left over from Pitch Black have gotten the warm and fuzzies. I've explained supermodel Jack above and I understand why the Imam character had to be significantly toned down post 9/11 but why change Riddick?

He hugs puppies (okay Hellhounds) and children. All the appeal of the character from the first movie seems to be missing. He still talks the talk but the walk is very different. Looks like someone lost a pair.",1257379200,4,2604,4.4789029535864975

A relative told me it reminded him of ""Dune"" which I scoffed at because I love David Lynch's ""Dune"" because
A) I'm a David Lynch fan and
B) Also I did NOT read Frank Herbert's famous book which maybe would have spoiled the movie if I were to demand it be a faithful adaptation.

ANYways, what he meant was that Chronicles of Riddick had aesthetic similarities with Dune, which is to *some* extent partially true, but Riddick is a cgi movie and so doesn't look the same.
I prefer sorta fake models to sort of fake digital ships. I don't quite get how people look at cgi and think it looks real.
I suppose it is a very willful suspension of disbelief. Give it a few years and all these cgi movies will look fake and terrible and people will laugh at them.

The plot is messy, the dialog not too bright. The acting campy. But it is a fun ride. I admit it grew on me. Saw some on TV and it doesn't stink as much as I first thought. It looked as if a boardroom in Hollywood had come to the conclusion they need a more urban, ""hip"" hero for today's youth market or something. Like the scene with the pitbull alien beast.

2125108,2,B0002VEUTY,"""Pitch Black"" was a brilliant piece of sci-fi -- dark, brutal, eerie, bloody and full of moral quandaries.

But even when you don't compare ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" to ""Pitch Black,"" the former comes out lacking. It's a ponderous, bloated expanse of special effects, with a plot that is stretched to the breaking limit. They're just hoping audiences don't notice.

After killing off some pursuing mercenaries, Riddick finds that someone has put a bounty on finding him -- it's Imam, the man he saved in ""Pitch Black."" When Riddick arrives on Helion Prime, Imam and the Elemental Aereon (Judi Dench) explain why: the death-worshiping Necromongers are sweeping through the galaxy, destroying whomever they don't convert.

And when the Necromongers invade Helion Prime, Riddick learns that he is a Furian -- and that it was prophesied that a Furian would kill the Necromonger Marshal (Colm Feore), the ""Holy Half-Dead."" He escapes the Necromongers, and has himself shipped to a brutal prison world where Jack/Kyra (Alexa Davalos) is being held captive. But even with her help, he may not be able to defeat an army of death-worshiping warriors.

Basically, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is an extension of the story in ""Pitch Black,"" but grown much more bloated and self-important. In fact, there's a very basic, simplistic plot once you strip away the creepy visuals and CGI -- and an end that just feels like ""To Be Continued.""

It has to be admitted, there are some truly great creepy moments -- panoramic views of burning planets, high-octane chases, and the eerie use of half-dead corpses as communicators (although it gets silly when they start screeching ""KILL THE RIDDICK!"") and even kissing through them. Weird, freaky stuff.

Unfortunately, overdone CGI is spread as thickly as peanut butter on this movie, and much of it is less than convincing. The scriptwriters also got lazy in places, loading down the dialogue with excruciatingly lame dialogue (""I'll kill you with my teacup"") and a distinct lack of plot for long stretches.

As usual, Vin Diesel can't act -- he basically smirks and growls his way through, just as he did in ""Pitch Black."" But he can't, can't, can't pull off some of those cheesy one-liners (""It's been a long time since I smelled beautiful"").

The Necromongers aren't much better, although the idea of a death-worship religion is intriguingly original, but Feore is just a basic baddie, Thandie Newton is a 2-D vamp, and Karl Urban just seems totally confused by what's going on. At least there's Judi Dench, even if she seems as confused as Urban.

""Chronicles of Riddick"" is both too much and too little -- too much action and CGI, too little plot and dialogue. Sister, they didn't know what to do with just one Riddick movie.",1243382400,,2760,4.956709956709957

2125110,5,B0002VEUTY,"I think this movie has gotten a bad rap by most reviewers. Maybe they are expecting too much or maybe they just don't understand what's being done here. Chronicles of Riddick (CoR) is an entertaining movie with just little bit of subtle sophistication and even a misunderstood pedigree. It's essentially an action/adventure kind of science fiction that doesn't go too terribly deep, but deep enough to get the story across and end up being an enjoyable experience.

I don't know if this was where the director was going, but I saw a lot of elements you would see in one of those classic 50's space operas. If you have seen any of the classic Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon serials you might get what I'm saying. The movie gives you the impression of being on a grand scale without actually being on that level. The plot itself is rather simplistic and that's why it works. The beauty is in the subtle complexities most probably won't even notice. The side plots in this movie don't seem to fit right, but by the end they show as being essential.

On a less glamorous note certain things that lend themselves to that 50's matinee style of Sci-Fi do seem cheesy like how stuff is named. You have villains called Necromongers. You have planets with names like Crematoria and races with names like Furyans. Names like that kinda kill the whole Riddick coolness. Riddick himself, on the other hand, is still the ultimate coolness he was in Pitch Black. I have to hand it Vin Diesel. He definitely has this character down. While Pitch Black did a decent job giving this anti-hero some development this movie further expands on it. You get a little more into his motivations and drives in this movie, which are mostly personal. I do believe this is the best anti-hero character I have seen in science fiction.

The action on this movie is sweet, but in the first few scenes it does go by VERY fast. After a while the action settles to a better pace, which will delight the bruisers in the crowd. The imagery is definitely worth watching and the set design is awesome. There is this medieval style to the Necromongers that give it both a familiar and unfamiliar vibe to them. Locations like Crematoria (I hate that name) are both fascinating concepts and nice looking design-wise. You get to see a lot of different types of special effects here and generally they look very solid. The computer-generated effects aren't in any way top notch, though they are several degrees better than movies like Van Helsing.

They have released a theatrical cut and an ""unrated"" director's cut. Supposedly some of the content that would have given the movie an R rating was put in the director's cut, but to be honest I didn't see anything that would have changed the rating in my eyes. I guess the MPAA are very picky about some things. What are the differences? Well for one there are about 14 more minutes added to the movie. Some of it just little details. Some of it totally new content that changes some scenes (and the storyline) completely. Some of it useless. The biggest and best change is the addition of a sort of Furyan destiny laid out in front of Riddick. Not awesome, but it is interesting.

The sad thing is some good stuff that was in the theatrical version is lost. One in particular is the big Necromonger (sigh...) fight scene in Crematoria (ugh...). The theatrical version was a shorter and apparently the sound editing would have been horrible if cut with the same audio. The result was a music only scene that I call the ""ballet of death"" that to me carried a higher sensory impact that the uncut, full audio, fight. I suppose less is more for me. Another cut I would have liked to see stay was Riddick's ""back of the bus"" monologue, which was replaced by a completely useless (although sexually suggestive) scene with one of the mercs.

Previous releases of this movie only gave you one option in regards to which version of the movie you wanted to see, including the HD-DVD release. This Blu-Ray release gives you both versions of the movie. That in of itself is a big bonus for a guy like me who sees good stuff from both versions. The good times don't stop there. The video is a VC-1 codec taken directly from the digital master (same as the HD-DVD release). I'm not going to say it's the absolute best transfer out there, but it is really nice and definitely is head and tails above any Riddick DVD release. The audio, on the other hand, gets the full praise with DTS-HD 5.1 lossless surround sound. Not even the HD-DVD had that. You also get DTS 5.1 surround in French and Spanish (subtitles in all three languages).

The extras are a mix of content that was available in the DVDs and HD-DVD along with a little more (I did say this was the best release to date, didn't I?). Here's the breakdown (all in 480p standard definition):

Intro by David Twohy - Just an explanation of the transfer of the Director's cut. It almost sounds like an apology to those who may notice the cuts in editing. Same intro as in the Extended Cut DVD and HD-DVD.

Director's Commentary - Actually pretty informative as David doesn't seem to shy away from share all the details in making the film. Same commentary from DVD and HD-DVD (essentially the previous releases).

Virtual Guide to Chronicles of Riddick - A few entries on the Riddick universe as told by the characters in the movie. Same feature from previous releases.

Toombs Chase Log - A personal log chronicling Toombs' hunting of Riddick up until the start of the movie as told by Tombs himself. Same featurette from the previous releases.

Visual Effects Revealed - A short featurette on the special effects of the movie. I believe this is brand new, but it's pretty brief (about six minutes) so not much of a new bonus.

Creation of New Mecca - A look at the various set pieces from the movie. Same as the HD-DVD and it seems this featurette replaces Riddick's Worlds from the DVD. Alas... no more 360 degree views of the more impressive sets.

Vin Diesel's Guided Tour - Vin walks you around the sets showing you behind the scenes work on the movie. Same as in the previous releases.

Riddick Rises - A discussion of the Riddick character by Director David Twohy and Vin Diesel. The two people who effectively created the character give more background info on our favorite anti-hero.

Keep What You Kill - Very cool analysis of the Necromongers and their culture as well as film details like costumes and props and such. Same featurette as in the HD-DVD.

Complete Chronicles - A U-Control feature with picture in picture narrative of Riddick. Includes both video footage and text trivia. This is aBlu-Ray exclusive.

Chronicles Compendium - Another Blu-Ray exclusive that is also a U-Control picture in picture feature that delves into pretty much all the other things in the Riddick universe that Complete Chronicles doesn't cover. In the same format as Complete Chronicles as well.

Anatomy of a Fight - Yet another U-Control feature exclusive to Blu-Ray. This one focuses on Riddick's combat strategies and methods.

Deleted Scenes - Same as all previous releases. Some are alternate scenes. Some would have been nice to have added to the Director's Cut. Some definitely best left off the movie. Commentary by Twohy also available.

BDLive enabled - Of course this is a Blu-Ray exclusive. If you want to share Riddick comments and stuff that's what BDLive is all about.

Chronicles of Riddick is a good solid story with the look of an epic film but with the sensibilities of a good old 50's Sci-Fi adventure. If you are into action then you should be happy with this movie. This current release by far offers the most from any previous release with both versions of the movie, lossless audio, and a few extra features not previously available. If you have a Blu-Ray player this is the version to get.",1238544000,17,7854,4.6555956678700365
2125111,4,B0002VEUTY,"Good show, but like most shows I've discovered that I don't like to watch them more than once.",1234137600,,94,4.277777777777778
2125112,2,B0002VEUTY,"""Pitch Black"" was a brilliant piece of sci-fi -- dark, brutal, eerie, bloody and full of moral quandaries.

But even when you don't compare ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" to ""Pitch Black,"" the former comes out lacking. It's a ponderous, bloated expanse of special effects, with a plot that is stretched to the breaking limit. They're just hoping audiences don't notice.

After killing off some pursuing mercenaries, Riddick finds that someone has put a bounty on finding him -- it's Imam, the man he saved in ""Pitch Black."" When Riddick arrives on Helion Prime, Imam and the Elemental Aereon (Judi Dench) explain why: the death-worshiping Necromongers are sweeping through the galaxy, destroying whomever they don't convert.

And when the Necromongers invade Helion Prime, Riddick learns that he is a Furian -- and that it was prophesied that a Furian would kill the Necromonger Marshal (Colm Feore), the ""Holy Half-Dead."" He escapes the Necromongers, and has himself shipped to a brutal prison world where Jack/Kyra (Alexa Davalos) is being held captive. But even with her help, he may not be able to defeat an army of death-worshiping warriors.

Basically, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is an extension of the story in ""Pitch Black,"" but grown much more bloated and self-important. In fact, there's a very basic, simplistic plot once you strip away the creepy visuals and CGI -- and an end that just feels like ""To Be Continued.""

It has to be admitted, there are some truly great creepy moments -- panoramic views of burning planets, high-octane chases, and the eerie use of half-dead corpses as communicators (although it gets silly when they start screeching ""KILL THE RIDDICK!"") and even kissing through them. Weird, freaky stuff.

Unfortunately, overdone CGI is spread as thickly as peanut butter on this movie, and much of it is less than convincing. The scriptwriters also got lazy in places, loading down the dialogue with excruciatingly lame dialogue (""I'll kill you with my teacup"") and a distinct lack of plot for long stretches.

As usual, Vin Diesel can't act -- he basically smirks and growls his way through, just as he did in ""Pitch Black."" But he can't, can't, can't pull off some of those cheesy one-liners (""It's been a long time since I smelled beautiful"").

The Necromongers aren't much better, although the idea of a death-worship religion is intriguingly original, but Feore is just a basic baddie, Thandie Newton is a 2-D vamp, and Karl Urban just seems totally confused by what's going on. At least there's Judi Dench, even if she seems as confused as Urban.

""Chronicles of Riddick"" is both too much and too little -- too much action and CGI, too little plot and dialogue. Sister, they didn't know what to do with just one Riddick movie.",1233273600,,2760,4.956709956709957
2125113,4,B0002VEUTY,"This is a popcorn flick, but well above average. Its really a re-working of Flash Gordon but with Flash being ""meaned-up"" and without a big camp sound-track. Which is a shame really. Oh, by the way, this review is a bit spoilerish, so if you are sensitive to plot details, look away now.

The plot starts with Riddick being hunted by Hellboy who is a Bounty Hunter. Failing to track down any coconut flavoured chocolate bars, he turns his attention to Riddick who has spent the last 5 years on the Planet Chillywilly 5, playing the steel drums in a Caribbean calypso band. Riddick promptly offs the crew and steals the ship leaving them only some jerk chicken and a chorus of ""Island in the Sun"" as he zooms off into the ether. He is soon to bump into the baddies.

The baddies, the ""Necromongers"" (who thankfully didn't hail from an aquatic planet which would have made them the less terrifyingly named ""Fishmongers"", ""We carry the word of Cod""!) are so remorseless, they are like the Borg from Star trek without the wooden tennis racket, long permed hair and headband. And like the Borg (the tennis player, not the Star Trek ones) they are cool and remorseless in their quest to destroy civilisation. The whole quest is a little vague, the main bloke once went on his holidays to a place called the ""Underverse"" and thought it would be a cracking wheeze for everyone else in the Galaxy to go there whether they like it or not. You know, a bit like that place in The Beach that got ruined when everyone wanted to go there after the film. Anyway....

The assault on the main planet at the start is fantastic, with the lacklustre French like defenders collapsing weakly within a day of the attack. Riddick who had been unfortunately caught up in the invasion when he had stopped off for a packet of cigarettes, zaps a couple of the Necromongers and in a quite hilarious sequence takes down one of their baddest boys with no effort whatsoever.

Escaping the Necros, Riddick is recaptured by Hellboy and they all whiz off to a prison planet called Crematoria, and bloody brilliant it is as well. Its all hot and that. And the guards are really mean, and Riddick and his youthful Ward (from Pitch Black, but I don't think it was the same actress) escape and then they go and have a bit fight with the Necromongers and Riddick kills the main chap, King Necro the 32nd or something ands they becomes King Necro the 33rd or something like that. Then get this, he has command of the entire army of millions of serious Necromongers who have nothing to do with themselves now. The comedy possibilities are endless. Riddick turns up at restaurants and then refuses to pay as he can destroy the entire planet when faced with an irascible Maitre'D, it really needed the Queen sound track though...",1232928000,,2784,4.5843373493975905
2125114,1,B0002VEUTY,"Pitch Black was no masterpiece but atleast it had some mystery and maintained some moments of unpredictability. here in this suposed sequel we have an over blown big budget sequel that doesnt resemble the original in anyway.

this sequel takes place some years after the events of the first movie. this time around Riddick is on the run from some mercenaries who want to capture him alive. Riddick in search of refugee finds help from one of the survivors of the first movie Abu ""Imam"" al-Walid (Keith David) it seems the refugee is futile, this is due to the unexpected attack by some outlanders known as Necromongers; their task is to conquer,conquer like the romans..funny thing is they are dressed in a similiar fashion.

anyways the movie does have some good points,such as descent visual effects,nicely choreographed fight scenes. but the rest is stupidity beyond imagination. the acting is stale,the lines are that of someone with no experience. the ending is abrupt and tedious. Its beyond me how both Thandie Newton and Judi Dench acepted to work in this garbage. as i said the effects are cool,so is the designing of the whole movie...but thats it;the remaining of the film is just crap and more crap. the editing is also very cheap..which is wierd for a big budget movie like this one. just watch it if you are a fan of the first,dont exprect a masterpiece,expect a dumb sci-fi movie.

It is very different than the first movie and the cartoon middle tale.  The scenery on each planet visited is beautiful but very different than the other settings.  Riddick's character has grown.  So has Jack's.  (I wish they could have used the same actress as the first movie.)  This movie is less the immediate danger of fighting monsters and more about religion and old-style conquering.  Riddick prevails in the end, and I think we are set up for more sequels.  Yay!  I am looking forward to them.",1216080000,,680,4.583333333333333
2125121,5,B0002VEUTY,"I must admit at first I didn't like CHRONICLES.  But little by little the movie grew on me.  I kept coming back and re-watching the DVD many times a year.  Honestly, I didn't realize I was even doing it.

Every time I re-watch CHRONICLES, I pick up something I missed the previous 30-40 times I watched it.  The movie is different and now I've come to see the genius of the writer who made this film.  CHRONICLES was ahead of its time.  It's a thinking film with a big budget.  It is definitely darker with no moral goals like Star Trek.  It's like Mad Max in outer space.

I can see why this movie did better on video.  It is a movie you have to buy because you'll need to rewatch it a few dozen times to get the whole picture.  It is too overwhelming and thought provoking to get in just one sitting.  At first, you won't like it because you won't understand most it the first time.  You need to watch it again and again.

This is just my opinion.  I can't wait till it comes out on Blu-Ray for a great price.",1215129600,,1011,4.107692307692307

2125125,4,B0002VEUTY,"[Spoilers abound, so be forewarned.......]

  The pulp fantasy/sci-fi approach is nothing really new.  Lucas flirted with it with Star Wars, 1980's Flash Gordon gaudied it up, and John Milius pumped it up with his take on Conan the Barbarian.  However, it's been sort of dormant recently, with movies opting for a ""serious"" epic treatment (Lord of the Rings), playing it safe (Chronicles of Narnia), or aiming for a post-modern, grim tone (The Matrix).  2004 saw the release of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", an unlikely sequel for the modestly performing ""Pitch Black"", a science fiction survival movie about the survivors of a crashed transport on a desolate planet.  Unlike Pitch Black, ""Riddick"" is not a smaller movie in the line of Alien.  For some people, this is why they don't like it (which is understandable).  For me, Riddick was great as a revival of the pulp sci-fi style of movie-making, with the obvious benefit of modern special effects delivering the visceral appeal needed for this kind of movie.

""The Chronicles of Riddick"" sees director David Twohy fleshing out the universe hinted at in ""Pitch Black"", where humanity's rapid expansion throughout the Galaxy has resulted in both the creation of a sanctioned mercenary/paid criminal storage system of law enforcement, and the rise of some bizarre fringe cultures, one of which is a nomadic army of crusaders called the Necromongers.  Cloaked in the trappings both medieval and futuristic, the ""Necros"" have been going from planet to planet, laying waste to worlds and ""converting"" survivors into new members for their ranks.  Meanwhile, Riddick (Vin Diesel), one of the three survivors left at the end of ""Pitch Black"", has been hiding on an ice-covered world for years, due in part to the fact that he's a ruthless killer.  When a ""merc"" named Toombs tries to nab him, Riddick hijacks his ship and goes to the world of Helion Prime to find out who put a private bounty on his head.  It turns out to be the Imam who he left with at the end of Pitch Black. The Imam, along with an ""Elemental"" called Aereon, think that Riddick is the ""right kind"" of bad guy to stop the Necromongers from wiping out humanity in their crusade.  As it happens, the Necros are already heading for Helion Prime, and end up conquering the planet.  Riddick, who wants nothing more than to slip through the cracks, ends up being swept into the conflict, and barely escapes the Necromonger's mobile citadel, only to end up being captured by Toombs, and sent to Crematoria, a hellish prison world, where he runs into Kyra, who was the other survivor of the ""Pitch Black"" incident.  It's only a matter of time before the inevitable confrontation occurs between Riddick and the Lord Marshal, leader of the Necros.

Visually, this movie is something else.  The movie's massive budget was partly used to build massive sets, with computer graphics shouldering the rest of the burden.  It's the visuals that keep the movie pumping along as Riddick heads from one situation to another.  While there's a sort of underlying thematic unity to the movie's universe, no one motif is overused.  The harsh, purple-lit, arctic wastes of Planet UV-6, the sun-drenched sands and Middle East-inspired city streets of Helion Prime, the gothic, metallic blue of the Necropolis city-ship, the grimy caverns of the Crematoria prison, and the weird, frozen lava floes of Crematoria's surface (where Riddick tries outrun a 700 degree sunrise)- these various settings keep the viewer from losing interest.  Where the visuals end, the two-fisted action picks up.  Whether it's the massive (if too short) battle for Helion Prime, Riddick trying to evade capture, or Riddick and other prison escapees making a desperate stand at dawn against a Necromonger squad, the movie delivers some kinetic scenes.  Even many of the ""quieter"" scenes, such as the Imam talking with Riddick on his balcony about the coming crisis, or the Necro Vaako searching for Riddick's trail in the sands of Helion Prime, kept my interest.

With a pretty good cast at hand, including Colm Feore, Keith David, Judi Dench, Karl Urban, and Linus Roache, it's surprising that the dialogue doesn't really rise to the actors' level.  There are some groan-worthy lines here, and not necessarily in a ""so bad it's good"" sense.  Sometimes characters will try to talk tough, only to have it fall flat in a big way.  On the other hand, it's the naked contrast involved in putting prison bull Riddick smack in the middle of the high-falutin' pretentions of the Necromongers and Helion Prime that ends up keeping this film light on its feet.  David Twohy keeps you guessing whether he takes this too seriously,  is playing things for laughs, or is balancing both approaches.  The ongoing interplay between the Dune-on-steroids, Byzantine attitudes of the movie's macroverse, and the sweaty, more earthbound hijinks of Riddick, the mercs, and the goons who run Crematoria keep things from ever getting too esoteric or conversely too mundane.  By the end of the movie, when the ending of Milius' ""Conan the Barbarian"" is expressly referenced, I felt I had gotten my money's worth.  Though the often stiff dialogue handed to characters like the Imam, the Lord Marshal and Vaako dares you to laugh at what's happening, the overall package delivers the pulp, sci-fi novel experience in high doses.  Those who have only seen the movie in the theater or cable will notice changes and additions, including scenes that add a bit of ""pseudo-mystic"" to Riddick (and his true origins) that may aggravate fans of Pitch Black's gritty approach, but do serve to help the movie's epic pretentions. Star Wars or Lord of the Rings don't have to worry about being replaced, but there's plenty of room for a newcomer to at least share the same shelf space.  I only hope that the not so great initial box office return won't discourage studios from giving the green light to another Riddick movie of the same scope.",1207958400,,5969,4.945891783567134
2125126,4,B0002VEUTY,"Surprisingly, this was my introduction to the Riddick series.  Watching this led me to Pitch Black, a truly great film.  It's true, the Chronicles storyline is skeletal, but the action keeps the pace moving along so there isn't a great deal of time to wonder ""why...?""  Its not until after the film that thoughtful reflection reveals how thin the plot is.  The ending was a surprise, which is a pleasure in this era of movie-making.  The special effects are stunning and believable, an especially impressive feat with Sci-Fi films.  Vin Diesel is great.  Granted, he doesn't need alot of range for the role, but he makes the most out of it. His marvelous voice conveys as much nuance as character development allows, and his physique is impressive.  He really is deft at conveying feeling (or lack thereof) through body language.

Vin Diesel is brilliant as the brutal yet tender convict Riddick who finds himself once more on the run across the Galaxy, this time with a bigger price on his head than before.

Enter an old friend from Pitch Black who has settled down with his young family, a planet about to be subjugated by the brutal Necromancers, an elemental race who predict probabilities based on cause an effect, Judi Dench is wonderful in this cameo role, elegant, stylish and full of secrets, she alone knows WHAT Riddick is and why the Lord Marshal fears him so much.

Karl Urban as the fanatical Lord Vakko of the Necromancers pushes all the right buttons to enrage Riddick and Thandie Newton as his scheming ambitious wife is a delight to behold along with a troubled Necromancer Commander, Linus Roache, an understated actor by the way, with secrets of his own along with an agenda that could the herald the end of the reign of the Lord Marshal. And then there is Kyra, the girl that Riddick loves but will never admit to loving, a girl he will go half way across the galaxy to find and save even if it means his own demise.

This is an action packed movie from beginning to end, with state of the art special effects, some fantastic fight sequences, some hilarious moments that make you laugh out loud, some briefly gross out moments and some eye popping stunts that have you on the edge of your seat, oh and the monster dogs on the prison planet are fantastic!

This is a great movie, get the Director's cut though, it rocks!",1202860800,,1717,4.455414012738854
2125130,5,B0002VEUTY,"by far my favorite vin diesel film especally with the return of Keith David as well, this is the 2nd installment of the chronicles of riddick series and the best one *until the 3rd movie release this year*
I own the regular version and unrated special ed dvd and yet I HAD to buy the umd for the portability and ability to plug the psp into your friends/girlfriend/boyfriend/insert friend/insert relative
a great item for taking on vacations etc.
superb for watching on a plane to pass the time quickly. this is an absolute must for psp owners because it's one of the best films on the psp. buy it here and now before it's too late. feed the Necromonger in you, keep what you kill and snag these films.
The film starts with someone (riddick looking a bit more furry then usual) running from a pursuing ship full of Mercs.
then riddick finds out there is a new bounty on his head and this time from the very holy man he took off that planet, he only told one man where he might go.
so off to planet helion prime (the planet of light) to confront the holy man (keith david) and find out why he has put a bounty upon him after saving his life.
riddick finds outfrom an elemental race that a sinister force only known as the ""necromongers"" are coming to ""convert"" or ""kill"" everyone everywhere unless riddick can stop them. sometimes it requires good to fight evil. and to fight a great evil sometimes you must use a greater evil.
a 5 star film all the way!

2125151,5,B0002VEUTY,"At the outset I will admit that I am really late with this review of this movie. I won't go into all the detail about the movie, as there has been many others who have already done that. What I can tell you is that this is the kind of movie that people either really love or really hate.

If you are expecting a completely fast paced action movie, this is not that kind of movie. If you are expecting part 2 to be exactly like Pitch Black, this is not that kind of movie. What this movie is would be best summed up as a continuation of the lives of the 3 characters who survived the events of Pitch Black. I liked it as a sequel as it didn't get into revisiting the alien planet, but instead you now see what the universe from this time period is like. You also see more of what drives the characters as they interact with each other.

I had a friend who didn't like this film mainly because he wanted them to go back to the alien planet from Pitch Black. He essentially wanted them to do the Alien and Aliens franchise. Based on Pitch Black doing something like that would have made no sense. So I for one am glad that they did not try to remake Aliens. I like the idea of taking the same characters and continuing on, since it is more realistic that their lives would not revolve around a planet where the aliens would only come out when it was night.

I liked this movie as an adventure more than just an action movie. Thus the additional scenes in the Director's Cut seem to explain things that wouldn't make sense without the additional 15 minutes that were added. I never saw the theatrical release, but based on the director's commentary the missing scenes really helped the movie. I also liked the special effects with the environments, since they looked really good and played into the mood of the movie. I also felt that this movie was more character driven and was also similar to the Greek tragedies. This is especially true in the context of Riddick not really being a typical good guy, but more of an anti-hero.

Some people say they didn't like the movie because it had no plot. To each their own, but I felt it had more plot than Pitch Black. I liked Pitch Black, but I wouldn't want to see a part 2 with the same Aliens and the same planet. Also, Chronicles to me had various plot elements found in Greek tragedies. It also can related to those who study Roman history as the Necromongers almost resemble elements of the Roman army. Also, this is a sci-fi movie so when people say certain parts of the movie are unbelievable, the question becomes how many sci-fi movies are actually believable?

You may have to rent the Chronicles of Riddick, Dark Fury cartoon in order to transition from Pitch Black to the Chronicles of Riddick. There are events that are somewhat explained in Dark Fury that help understand this movie. There is also a video game called Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay that explains things for both Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick.

I have watched this movie a number of times and I still enjoy watching it with the slow build up to the main point of the movie. This may not work for everyone, but it really did for me. I felt myself feeling connected to the characters, even the bad ones. The last fight scene is interesting in that it is different in terms of execution from typical action movies i.e. good guy mops the floor with bad guy for most of the fight. Watch it and see how Riddick transitions from being the one in control, to not having control, and at the very end gaining more control than he expected at a heavy price.

I really hope they make another Chronicles of Riddick. This type of movie has the potential to do a number of additional films or such.",1187827200,2,3729,4.372294372294372

2125153,2,B0002VEUTY,"If you're looking for a truly entertaining and well developed sci-fi movie, watch Pitch Black, the first movie in this series.  The first film explores an alien world with lethal creatures and pits survivers of a crashed space ship against them and one another.  Great characters, visuals, and story.  Chronicles doesn't hit even close to the high marks of the first film.

Chronicles can most easily be summed up as a brainless sci-fi action adventure popcorn flick.  Even the impressive visuals cannot save this film with its sub-par acting, bad dialogue and terrible story.  It's just too over the top and ridiculous, and if you don't feel that way by the time Riddick & crew are running from the scorching sunlight on Crematoria, then there is just no use debating films with you.

This movie is so painful to watch in light of the superior Pitch Black. A clunky storyline, with some of the most embarrassing lines ever to stain a movie. The FX is very good most of the time, but good FX does not make for a good movie.

The ""plot"" has been rehashed over and over so I will spare you. Riddick was a very interesting character before this movie. In this movie, he is turned into a shallow superhero with a bad attitude. Yeah, I know he changed at the end of Pitch Black because of ""the captain"", but this is not the same character at all.

If you are in the mood for a mindless action flick, this will probably serve you well. If you want a well written, interesting movie, look elsewhere.",1185148800,2,942,4.305084745762712

You can see and learn more and more with each and every viewing. Those that do not get it, simply don't want too.

2125168,3,B0002VEUTY,"Vin Diesel reprises his role as Riddick in THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK.  The character first came to life in the movie PITCH BLACK.  In the first movie, Riddick is portrayed as a cold-hearted killer who happens to have the skills to get himself and a few survivors off a deadly world.  In CHRONICLES, he gets remade into a brooding loner/anti-hero whose destiny is to save worlds.  It's a huge step, and not one most moviegoers -- including fans -- can take in a single swallow.

On the other hand, the upgrade to cutting-edge computer generated imagery is absolutely stellar.  When you see Helion Prime and the other worlds and sets on the screen, the tendency is to believe that they really exist.  The world just comes across as incredibly real.

The problem is that the film is somewhat lackluster, depending on the star power of Diesel (not a bad bet) and some of the other supporting actors and actresses to move the story along.  Unfortunately, not much character comes to light.  Riddick is busy telling everybody that the fight with the Necromongers (who come entirely too close to the Borg from Star Trek for my liking) isn't his.  He tells them this while standing in the doomed city the Necromongers are currently taking over.  Talk about timing!

Personally if I'd been Riddick, I'd have just found a new place to hide and disappeared for another five years.

Still, the film delivers on more than the CG and visual splash.  There are plenty of over-the-top fights and near-death escapdes that will keep you in your seat waiting to see how it all turns out.

There's a cliffhanger of an ending, though, but Diesel has stated that there will be two more films in the Riddick continuity.  He hasn't said when those will be coming out.  But for a B-grade SF movie night with your buddies and a generous portion of whiz-bang graphics to show off your new HD DVD player, you can't go wrong with this movie.",1164499200,7,1912,4.6398809523809526

2125171,3,B0002VEUTY,"After fending off a bounty hunter, Riddick decides to pay a visit on those that put a price on his head.  There he runs into old acquaintances and meets an Elemental (Judy Dench).  There is a terrible danger to the planet and they feel Riddick can help.  The danger is a group known as Necromongers.  They basically believer there is an underverse were death is perfect unlike the flawed life of the universe.  Their leader, the Marshal, has actually been to the underverse and returned a changed man.  They travel from planet to planet recruiting new members and killing all who do not join.  Now Riddick is on their next target.

Riddick's unique brand of self interest and order drives him through the movie and the conflict with the seemingly unstoppable foe.  We see political intrigue among the upper ranks of the invaders.  We learn more of Riddick's past (no mention of his being a government trained assassin).  We learn how Riddick and the Necromongers crossed paths in the past.  We learn almost nothing of the Elementals.  It all comes together in a somewhat confusing ending that leaves plenty of loose ends and unanswered questions.

This is a strange and confusing film.  Much of it seems like there was no real overall plan.  The Necromonger Marshal is one of the anomalies.  The Marshal is replaced every few years yet the current Marshal is practically a god.  Many of the Necromongers seem a little preoccupied by the pleasures of life.  I would like to have known a little more about the Elementals but there is almost nothing about them.  Then there is the ending.  Just what does it bode?  How does it resolve the situation?  What happens next?  We don't really know and it is frustrating.  Plenty of action and plot pieces but it just didn't seem to hold togther they way it should.

2125174,5,B0002VEUTY,"I must admit that had my doubts about this film. After all Vin Diesel? Come on. My friend - another sc-fi lover who can tell the difference between great Sci-fi (Alien, Bladerunner, 2001 SO) and [...] sci-fi (Total Recall) surprised me by recommending it and left it at my house for me. It sat there for weeks until I realized I had to get it back to him the next day. Anyway was intending to give the film just ten minutes of my life but soon realized I was in for a hell of a ride.

And boy what a ride. Sure, I can see why many people love or hate this film. Vin Diesel has no range as an actor other than to play a tough guy sort of role. Yet what limits him in other films works really well here; he's exciting, unpredictable, and yes tough and I guess not much more. But I don't want anything more. I'm not expecting anything else from Riddick other than to be tough and to get the bad guys.

The story is a hackneyed tale taken from any fantasy/history book - murderous, ruthless invaders being brought down by the actions of a single person. But the level of detail that went into the creation of the various civilizations, armies, and characters keeps one's attention. I loved the contrast between the relatively human/modern technology of the New Mecca civilization and the fantasy/ghostlike/medieval technology of the Necromongers right down to the corpse-tech communications system, and creatures the Necs used to flush out human beings.

And what about Crematoria? A fabulous creation - a planet that burns by day and freezes by night. The special effects - the Nec invasion - WoW! Stunning CGI done to a scale one couldn't imagine before in the old school days of Bladerunner or Alien.

No, this isn't cerebral, arty or original, but an exciting adventure, great to look at and a hell of a lot of fun.",1154131200,4,1815,4.490909090909091
2125175,5,B0002VEUTY,"Simply stunning flick on HD DVD.  Considering early reviews that downplayed the difference between standard DVD and HD, I wasn't expecting such an incredible image (and some HD DVDs aren't that much of an improvement over regular DVD; see SERENITY).  This is the disc I'll throw on whenever I want to show someone what HD DVD is all about.

As for the movie, this is what sci-fi should be: daring and way over the top.  After PITCH BLACK, who would have have thought Riddick's story would have taken such an epic turn?  I don't know whether it's an ego trip, creative cliff diving, or a just a return to ""old school"" sci-fi where writers created new myths, unique worlds, and bizarre technology (and tread dangerously toward embarrassment with coining their own vocabulary -- can it get any better than ""Underverse"" and ""Necromongers""?).

I hope it's the latter, but it doesn't matter.  Just enjoy the ride.  With all the tired sci-fi thrown at us by Hollywood, it's great to have something fresh given to us.  Forget what you've read from critics and the fanboys out there; THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK is the real goods.  Great HD DVD.",1153526400,5,1134,4.739795918367347

Plenty of goodies for the space addict including great ship/world designs, unique planets, etc.

On my list of best sci-fi of all time, this flick is in the top ten. It is the complete package, and brings a much needed darker space opera world to the big screen.

Call the Chronicles of Riddick the anti-Star Wars, if you will. I mean that as a compliment. I love Star Wars, but this is definately the anti-hero version. The Chronicles of Riddick is gritty, dark and intense. There are no ""beww, beww"" laser beams here. Nope. The good and bad guns fire hefty guns, and carry knives and axes. Here's hoping that 2-3 more Riddick films make their way to the screen.

2125192,5,B0002VEUTY,"This movie isn't perfect....but when you have only two hours to put together a cohesive narrative about a universe so complex, things get dicey.

As it stands, CoR is probably not the best sequel for Pitch Black...in fact it's a genre departure of collosal proportions, revealing  a universe which is almost infinitely more complex than the very restricted one seem in Pitch Black. PB was a man vs. nature type Alien horror movie. CoR is a sci-fi mythology...showing the bigger picture of where Riddick's destiny lies, as well some interesting clues into into his origins.

In the process, you get a glimpse into a universe which has a richness and complexity rarely seen in modern sci-fi space opera. It's a world in which medieval gothic motifs blend in seamlessly with futuristic steel and machinery....a world where magic and the supernatural meld in effortlessly with the science. The result is a movie which is hard to categorize...and yet is compelling enough that you want to learn more about it.

On the surface it's a story about balance, but adds the twist that enacter of balance (Riddick) is himself not so very balanced. Billed as an anti-hero, Riddick is really hard to pin down....however, the viewer knows deep down that he is just the hero...driven by passion and hatred, but also ultimately caring for the ones he loves.

Vin Diesel does a remarkably good job in the movie reprising his tough guy criminal Riddick, but he's also helped by a superb supporting cast. The dialogue in this movie is interesting and well paced. The effects and action are well orchestrated. Understanding the movie requires multiple viewings, and watching the Director's Cut is a must...it explains a lot of backstory.

Most of my friends panned this movie...for various reasons. Some simply had it in for Diesel, some wanted to see Pitch Black II, and some simply didn't understand it. Whatever the case, when I saw it, I was very impressed, impressed enough to buy the DVD and watch it multiple times.",1140393600,2,2000,4.902366863905326
2125193,1,B0002VEUTY,"I rarely watch a movie that is so atrocious as to startle me out of my usual good humor long enough to write a bad review, but this one succeeded, which is something of an accomplishment, if you think about it. Now, I am not a fan of  Vin Diesel's films at the best of times (excluding the HILARIOUS ""Pacifier""), but I always go into a movie with an open mind. In this case, a very open mind, since Karl Urban co-starred!

What a slap in the face! From the seizure-inducing beginning to the boorishly predictable finale, there was not one enjoyable moment, aside from the times that the dialogue veered on the side of unintentional farce. (""Take them before the quasi-dead."" I was so reminded of ""The Gods Must be Crazy"" that I fell off the couch laughing.) Judi Dench was completely thrown away on this travesty of film-making. Karl Urban, the Norse god from the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and the irresistably HOT bad-boy from the ""Bourne Supremacy"" seemed to be somnambulating, and what is worse, his disdain for his own character is highly visible at some points. If you must play an annoying half-dead man, at least have the artistic integrity to play him well! Not even Mr. Urban's breathtakingly good looks could survive the double onslaught of mohawk and ponytail. *insert hair-raising emoticon here*

Now, as regards Vin Diesel. I have nothing against him. I even found ""XXX"" reasonably entertaining, and was proportionatly upset when he was replaced in the sequel. The problem is, he always plays exactly the same character, with minor variations in the name. In this movie, he just didn't quite play the character as well (ha) as usual.

I love action movies. I am a sci-fi junkie. Well, maybe not ""junkie,"" but something close. Sit me down in front of a TV playing ""Stargate,"" and I'll love you forever. Just don't ever make me suffer through this film again!",1140307200,4,1873,4.701219512195122

That said, it's absolutely not a continuation of Pitch Black, but rather, another episode in the life of it's main character, Riddick. This movie moves away from the pure scifi of the original and incorporates an element of fantasy, as well. I'm never sure about the mixing of the two genres, but it mostly works in this instance. The only thing I really didn't care for was the implication that Riddick's eyes weren't something he got while in the slam. But even that can be looked at from the viewpoint of how likely would it be for a prisoner in a hellhole of a prison to be able to acquire the type of technological tools required for such a delicate operation, so maybe it's not so bad after all if his eyes were a gift of the gods instead.",1138665600,,801,4.382550335570469

Think of a very camp Flash Gordon crossed with Dune and add just a twist of Star Wars and you'll have a pretty good idea of how derivative The Chronicles of Riddick is. In fact it seems little more than a platform for Vin Diesel to strut his stuff. And strut he does! Holding those poses like he's carrying two rolls of invisible carpet under his arms.

The story is pretty irrelevant, but involves goodies (Diesel and a motley crew of hangers on) and baddies (boo-hiss fascists with a fetish for wearing pretty-boy armour).

Battle scenes are reasonably convincing, but gratuitous over-use of strobe lighting (especially in the extended opening combat sequence) is very irritating.

I've seen worse sci-fi movies than this, but not many.  The old formulaic cowboys and injuns in space can never do the genre justice as, I believe sci-fi should contain more mystery and wonder than this.

Oh and Judy Dench as a rather silly, wispy ""elemental"" looks downright embarrassed throughout.",1128729600,5,1149,4.984293193717278

2125213,4,B0002VEUTY,"Well, no, not really, I'm not. But Riddick's enemies---and by Furia, he has a passle of them in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", David Twohy's follow-up to the rousing monster-mash ""Pitch Black""---should be. Oh yes indeed.

Riddick (good old shaven-pated Vin Diesel doing his raspy, surly, growly thang), if you remember, is that amoral piece of space-trash, former Level 3 Max-Lockup prisoner, that intergalactic rogue who was all in it for himself, Devil take the hindmost, lead, follow, or get out of the way. Oh, and he had those funky eyes (chiefly covered up by his hip goggles) that fixed the old boy up with nightvision. So when the Going gets Dark, Riddick gets Going.

Boy does he ever: he slices, he dices, he does double flips, he twists and leaps and hurdles, he kicks and tears and shoves blades in just about every possible spot you'd think to shove a blade. So yeah, if I'm facing down Riddick, I'm afraid of the Dark.

It's a few years after the fun wholesome family carnage in ""Pitch Black"". Riddick has been camped out on the amusingly named UV-6, presumably chasing Taun-Tauns and making snow-angels. Bad boy bounty hunter Toombs shows up, Riddick does his thing, and ends up heading across the galaxy to Helion Prime, to find out exactly why somebody from his past put a very big bounty on his shiny bald head.

Riddick hooks up briefly with his old space-traveling Muslim pal Imam (Keith David, who looks like he's channeling up Malcolm X), and then gets a way impressive introduction to the Galaxy's latest Axis of Evil (they even bring their own Axis): the Necromongers. Convert or Kill, and Keep what you Kill: that's the Necromonger way.

The Necromongers are real party-poopers, by the way. They introduce themselves by crashing their huge phallus-shaped spaceships into your planet, kill or convert everybody, give boring speeches about ""verses"" (yeah, the Helion Prime people were scared, but when Linus Roache's Necromonger Purifier starts babbling about ""other verses"" you could see their eyes glaze over...mine did....zzzz...shut up or kill me), then burn the planet to the ground. Their leader, the Lord Marshall (Colm Feore), is also big into boring speeches and zig-zagging around his helpless victims. Show-off.

Not even the hotty Lady Macbeth-like Necromonger princess Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) has much fun: she works hard at giving her lover/pawn Lord Vaako Karl Urban a spine, and puts her eye-makeup on with a Bic lighter. Blegh.

Can't an old space pirate just find a little hooch and a place to flop? Well, you know what happens when you get between a rogue like Riddick and a hot meal: Riddick does what he does best, which is thrash.

Frankly, I saw ""Chronicles"" after about a case of very good Laphroaig, and it made no sense; after I sobered up, I saw it again. It still makes no sense. But frankly, that's all good: all I wanted was a movie in which Riddick would snarl, slaughter some foolish mortals, rinse, repeat. I got it!

And the movie is indeed a pretty thing: stuff blows up, Riddick and his buddies run across the prison-planet Crematoria from a really ambitious sun, there are gunfights and massacres and guttings galore, Twohy shows off all the eye-candy at his disposal, and Judy Dench floats around a lot. I still have no idea what she was doing, but hey: the point is, it all looks pretty. It has lots of slaughter. Alexa Davalos (Kyra/Jack) is cute and deadly, always a nice combo.

Diesel's goggles alone should win an Oscar: the man takes them off, shoves them back on, takes them off, and not once does he have to clean 'em! I want a pair.

2125214,3,B0002VEUTY,"First off, let me say that I do own a copy of this one, which is rare. In order to enjoy this film, one must forget that David Twohy is an embarassment to the sci-fi film world. Much of his story here is campy (if I could bold-face that, I would) and overblown in a cheesy sort of way. How else does one come up with ""Necromongers"", ""Quasi-Deads"", and ""Crematoria"" - couldn't SOMEONE have at least spoken to Twohy about taking a few minutes to come up with more believable and less cliched names for these elements?

Having said that - I found that I very much enjoyed this film. The rest of the cast and crew manage to take what is a terrible set-up from Twohy, and really worked to make the film the exceptional work that it is. Would I say it ranks up with Blade Runner or 2001, of course not. But, it is more than just a fun way to kill a couple of hours. The story as it is shown on the screen is visually stunning in places (especially on Crematoria and below).

2125216,4,B0002VEUTY,"Well, Riddick, our favorite dark hero with the freaky eyes and awesome goggles. This movie takes place after the sci fi/horror classic Pitch Black (2000), which first introduces Riddick( Vin Diesel), as he does some serious monster killing!!! From the beggining he is a rogue, a convict and scum of the earth, who is known for breaking out of Butcher Bay(see video game on xbox or pc,.... won't be sorry!!! In the end though he always seems to be the hero.

 Unlike ""Pitch Black"", a sci fi horror survival thriller, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", is more like a an straight forward action packed sci fi adventure that has your eyes jumping for joy!!! For any sci fi fan this is a must see especially Director's Cut!!! Riddick has his same old personalty as the tough guy, serial killer mad man, rogue, but with a new enemy called The Necromongers, and their religion, convert or die is their catch phrase, along with keep what you kill,...... as they sweep through the galaxy, unchallenged, well Riddick will stop that and bring them hell to their doorstep!!!

 Some critics bombarded complaints about the original version of this movie shown at theatres, just because it didn't make sense ,and they've never seen anything like it!!! Most people, by instinct fear change,.... just think that Elvis, ""the king"" wasn't always thought highly upon with his new breaking the boundary style, but look at him now, one of the most famous artists of all time!!! What I'm trying to say folks that some people may fear change but, it really doesn't have to be that way!!!

 I am a sci fi fan and must say that Riddick is a work of art, and visualy amazing!!! True the original version was flawed in some ways, yet still action packed and great!!! The Director's Cut is a whole new story!!! They've took the original version and have fixed every flaw and have added more to the movie, helping guide the story smoother, telling more about Riddick, and the history of the universe in general, along with some more action, and a great ammount of bonus material, that will please you greatly!!!

 If you didn't like the original version, try the Director's Cut, which is a must see!!! You will have fun, as Riddick easil take out mercs, break out a triple max security prision, and give those Necromongers hell!!! Riddick is a Furian, and is predicted to be the one that can stop the Grand Marshal, and the Necromongers reign in blood, forever!!! This movie will have you fearing the dark!!!

 The original Chronicles of Riddick is a very good movie, but the Director's Cut is an awesome movie ,along with some great bonus material!!! I will overall give this a 4/5,... it's not the best movie in the world true, but if you love sci fi you will really want to see this!!! ""Two Thumbs Up !""!!!!!

 You may also want to check out ""Dark Fury""(2004) an great animated Riddick feature that will give you more infor mation about Riddick's life, along with the classic ""Pitch Black"" (2000"", where the legend begins!!! If you play video games make sure to check out ""Riddick Escape From: Butcher Bay"" which is one of the best games ever made graphic and gameplay wise!!!

 I think ""The Cronicles of Riddick"" could have been better, being more of an hardcore sci fi which some people aren't familar with, but heck this is a great movie, slightly rushed and unstable, but still great!!!

I'm not sure if the character of Riddick (from Pitch Black) ever justifies the portentious deification Twohy affords him, but the possibly tragic ending is none the less intriguing. Beautifully shot, the story dares to be dark although I fear it may be too lumbering and lugabrious to withstand too many repeat viewings. I do think it was a mistake to recast Jack.

2125220,4,B0002VEUTY,"Just a quick review here to offset the previous review.

Chronicles of Riddick is campy, plain and simple. I can see where some people would be put off by that. Its a space opera, not unlike the novels of David Weber or William Dietz. One man faces terrifying odds to fix what's wrong with the universe. Its improbable and sometimes illogical, but its entertaining and goes places that most made-for-the-screen sci-fi simply won't go.

Its a shame that ""Riddick"" flopped at the box office. This is, by far, Vin Diesel's best character. He was born to play Riddick. And Twohy is a great action/spook film director (check out ""Below"" to see what I'm talking about).

This **could** have been a wonderful series of films. If you've seen this through to the end, you know what I'm talking about. That ending yielded many possibilities.

""Riddick"" is not without its flaws. The pacing of the Director's Cut is a little uneven, but not ponderous. You get much more backstory than the theatrical release. Karl Urban is in total camp mode (his haircut is simply criminal). You gotta wonder what drew Judi Dench to this project. She gives more grace to her underwritten role than it deserves, although I suspect her character would've been expanded had ""Riddick"" yielded a sequal. Thandie Newton, doing her best Lady MacBeth impression, is just terrible. Her scenes with Dench are a study in opposites. Colm Feore is somewhat menacing, but why do I keep remembering him from ""Chicago"" while watching this movie? And Nick Chinlund is always good for a laugh.

For all of its flaws, ""Riddick"" is a fun, imaginative space romp. I'd love to see more like it, but the audience just isn't there. Maybe Diesel will further expand this alternate universe like he did in his company's exceptional video game, ""Escape from Butcher Bay"".",1122422400,12,1817,4.848387096774194

2125227,5,B0002VEUTY,"I had no idea what to expect before I actually saw this movie. I had already seen Pitch Black and I still watch it. This is the continuation of the story of Riddick. He was found in a dumpster, as an infant, with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck. The question of why, is answered in this film if you watch carefully. Riddick is a Furyan, a different breed of human, born and bred for war and killing. He has been in and out of prisons almost his entire life. He has been hiding for the last five years on an uninhabited ice planet in order to protect two of the people he helped save when the Hunter Grazna crashed on a planet, and the ensuing nightmare of darkness and slaughter by the denizens of said planet.

Riddick treated like an animal in a cage for so much of his life and hardly knowing how to relate to the human race anymore, starts a slow painful journey to regain his humanity in Pitch Black and you can see his incremental steps forward with a few slips back, in this film.

That's what most reviewers forget. The entire thing is about Riddick. Everything else is icing. There are fewer words in the script, but if you recall, Riddick didn't speak for almost the first half of Pitch Black. Riddick is a thinker and a doer, not much of a talker, which is what I would expect if he had been tied up with a horse bit in his mouth for quite a long time. You have to figure out what's going on inside him. Riddick takes on the Necros because Kyra gets captured, not out the goodness of his heart. He fights the Lord Marshal to regain Kyra and to survive, not because the universe is in trouble.

He gave up his freedom voluntarily and lived like a hermit on one of the most inhospitable worlds in the known planets to protect Jack/Kyra and Imam from Mercs. The only thing that brought him out was percieved betrayal by Imam.

If you can look under the seemingly superficialness of the movie you will find quite a bit of the good stuff. The special effects are so big in the movie that you can become lost in them if you don't pay attention to the details. The special effects are great! But what I really enjoyed was watching Riddick actually continue to grow through this movie.

In previous prison escapes Riddick always escaped alone, on Crematoria he actually tried to help some of the others. He made a sacrifice of himself to go there and rescue Jack/Kyra. He had never willingly gone into a prison before, he was always escaping them.

I saw quite a bit in this film, and I haven't seen anyone else mention any of this. You can overlook a lot if you just look at the muscles and the action. I highly enjoyed this flick, it's one of the better films to come out of that year. Riddick is real, whatever else he may be, and he isn't so sweet a hero/antihero that he gves you tooth decay.

I liked everything about the film, the bad guys were original and not cookie cutter copies. The character was familiar and the story logically progressed from the last film. If Pitch Black had the kind of money in it's budget that this film had, I'll bet it would have been mind boggling.

The other thing reviewers tend to forget is that this is fiction. It's pure imagination and fantasy, just what great escapist entertainment is all about.

I want to see impossible feats, bigger than life action and all the frills that go with it. If I wanted real life, I'd stay outside the theater. I want to see the grand large sets and the great special effects, but at the same time I want good acting also. I believe everyone in this film did a credible potrayal of the characters they were playing.

After saying all that, I'll end with this.

I love this movie. I own it and Pitch Black and I watch both of them. I guess I must have watched the both of them more than twenty times already, and I'm still not tired of them yet!

I'll give this movie an excellent rating.",1118188800,29,3879,4.313186813186813
2125228,5,B0002VEUTY,"My mind hasn't been boggled in a while -> The very first StarWars did me in, and then various parts of The Lord of the Ring years later.  Other than that I'm not one who stares at the screen in awe of special effects.  In fact, the bore me very quickly.  What I likes about the original Riddick film, Pitch Black, was that, outside of the Alien knockoff monsters, there was very little in the way of large scale special effects.  In many ways, it was an intimate thriller rather than a vast drama.

So I really wasn't prepared for what appeared on this screen as the film unrolled.  It sneaks up on you as it opens with Riddick's attempted capture by Toombs, a bounty hunter.  The irritated (and very hairy) Riddick sets out to find out who put the bounty on his head and discovers that he is being recruited to stop the conquest of space by the Necromongers.  These latter are truly the knights of total badness.  Their goal is entropy - the total destruction of life and rebirth onto another plane, the Underverse.  The Necromongers, despite a truly heroic culture, are so bad that Vin Diesel comes up smelling like a rose.

Why hire Riddick?  The theory is that sometimes you need to fight evil with a different evil.  Riddick is one of the last Furyans, a people who met the Necromongers and lost.  An entire male generation was destroyed right down to infants strangled with their birth cords.  If anyone would want to destroy the Necromongers Riddick should.  Or he would if he cared, and starting out, he doesn't.  But as he walks out the Necromongers arrive.  Diesel gets caught in the combat, captured by Toombs and dumped on a prison planet where he finds Kyra (who was Jack in the first film).

When the Necromongers show up again hunting for Riddick, the whole thing falls apart.  Riddick, who has been pretty even tempered for a stone killer, gets really, really mad.  Now it is the hunters who are hunted in a spectacular display of violence, betrayal, and architecture.  Yes, I said architecture.

Whoever did the set design and effects for this film (hats off to director David Twohy) simply went insane.  The planetary and prison settings were delightful on their own (imagine being chased across a planet by a sunrise that will burn you to a crisp), but the work on the Necromongers is simply amazing.  They have been designed from the ground up.  Clothes, armor, spaceships, interiors, culture, etc., etc., etc.

Between the effects and the settings I had to watch the film twice to notice that there really was a plot, albeit a skeletal one.  And half the actors to reasonable jobs with a script of a maximum of 2,000 words.  Purists who demand great art and drama may be dismayed, but this film was downright fun to watch.  A sci-fi barnburner with all the stops pulled out.  If you like fast, furious, and dirty, Riddick is the hero for you.",1118102400,123,2863,4.576771653543307
2125229,5,B0002VEUTY,"I am a discriminating Sci-Fi fan, both literature and film, and I definitely do not agree with what professional critics had to say about this movie.  I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the reviews and watched it for myself.

The story includes Dune-like intricacies (prophecy, conflicting character motives, foreshadow, plots within plots, human weaknesses, multiple heroes, patience, questionable morality, rituals, inner challenges, sacrifice, etc.) but without the extended, drawn-out politics to slow the story.  It is fast paced and entertaining along with the important issues and messages.  The art in this film is breathtaking including the rocky fins and caves of the ice planet, the Necromonger ship; the sparkling seas, sands, and architecture of Helion Prime; and the brutal beauty of the jagged, glassy, and blistering Crematoria.  The DVD version really showcases the artistic elements of this movie.

The film has a Conan flavor with the non-traditional and non-innocent hero doing the right thing instead of the easy thing, and getting involved though he doesn't have to.  The superhero (and regular hero) qualities of the Riddick character are also a nice addition to the story: speed, protection of the weak, strength, ease of killing, frequent flying through the air during attacks/escapes, quick thinking, sense of humor, resistance to Necromonger mental intrusion, enhanced eyes for night vision (Achilles heel being light sensitivity), precision, gracefulness despite bulk, piloting skills, use of varied weaponry, respect for life, risk taking, etc.  The combination of weaponry is also interesting - unique craftsmanship blades mixed with Sci-Fi technology weapons.  However, the violence in this film is very tasteful, similar to the Zatoichi movies, where our hero is able to kill without a lot of blood and gore.  And he only deals out death when forced to, not at whim or randomly.  There is also a similarity to Kurosawa stories as well, specifically Yojimbo and Sanjuro regarding the flawed hero and the motives of the characters, with some events and symbolism corresponding to Throne of Blood.  The story of The Luck Child is also played out in this film, which is especially nice for those of us who love fairy tales.

The acting is first-rate.  All of the actors did a fine job, but Vin Diesel's performance is truly exceptional.  I had no idea he was so incredibly talented.  (I always thought he was mainly an ""eye candy"" actor.  Not so.)  He is amazingly expressive throughout the movie without the use of his eyes at all.  (They are surgically enhanced with no pupils and covered with goggles part of the time.)  And his voice, diction, and inflection are obviously a product of natural talent, serious training, and careful attention to his craft.  I now have a new appreciation for the quality of his work.

I would rank this film right up there with some of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all time including Metropolis, Blade Runner, and Forbidden Planet; and the story itself merits comparison to classic Sci-Fi books such as the Robot novels, Dune, The Chronicles of Amber, and the Foundation series.  I recommend people watch this film and judge its merits for themselves.  I don't think the critics of this movie watched it very carefully.

I have great difficulty choosing between Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick as far as a favorite.  The stories are both wonderful with important and profound messages, as well as unique and interesting elements; but they are so dissimilar that a side-by-side comparison is not really feasible.  The fact that the two are so different from one another is a good part of what makes them both incredibly special and a significant contribution to the realm of Science Fiction entertainment.  I truly hope that if more films are added to this saga, they are equally original and surprising in content and style, instead of relying on formula or cookie cutter repetition like many series seem to.

2125230,4,B0002VEUTY,"In 2000, writer/director David Twohy introduced the world to his dark hero character named Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) in the sci-fi/film noir film entitled ""Pitch Black"".  Four years later, he wrote/directed the sequel that was entitled ""The Chronicles of Riddick"".  In this action-packed film noir sequel, Riddick, after having been on the run for five years, has been captured by a group of bounty hunters lead by a man named Toombs (Nick Chinlund).  While en route to the planet Helion Prime (where the bounty on Riddick was initiated), Riddick escapes and takes over Toombs ship.  He lands on Helion Prime and goes in search for Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David, a returning character/actor from ""Pitch Black"").  Unfortunately, Helion Prime has also become the latest target of conquest for a group called the Necromongers that are essentially the living-dead (not vampires though).  The Necromonger attack fleet wreaks havoc upon the population of Helion Prime, whose survivors are then given the ""opportunity"" to become Necromongers themselves by their leader known only as Lord Marshal (Colm Feore).  Many refuse this ""offer"", including Riddick who is also present.  Riddick is taken by the Necromongers for further questioning at the request of a woman named Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton), who is the wife to a leading Necromonger general named Vaako (Karl Urban).  Using Necromongers conditioned to be powerful mind-readers, the Necromongers quickly discover that Riddick is a Furian, which is a race that Lord Marshal fears most.  Though Riddick is able to escape from the Necromongers, he is again captured by Toombs and his latest crew who decide to take him to an extremely inhospitable penal planet called Crematoria.  It is there that Riddick comes across the prisoner Kyra (Alexa Davalos), but Lord Marshal is determined to recapture Riddick, so he sends Vaako and a group of Necromonger soldiers in pursuit from Helion Prime.

With a combination of elaborate sets, CGI special effects, dark cinematography and good costuming, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is visually very entertaining.  The plot is interesting and the dialog is fair; but the editing was not as good as it could have been. Overall, though, it's an entertaining and interesting film that I rate with 4 out of 5 stars.  Other notable characters include the elemental human Aereon (Judi Dench), the Necromonger Purifier (Linus Roache), The Guv of the Crematoria prison (Yorick van Wageningen), Lajjun (Kimberly Hawthorne), Ziza (Alexis Llewellyn) and Eve Logan (Christina Cox).",1117065600,10,2560,5.288888888888889
2125231,4,B0002VEUTY,"I liked Pitch Black a lot, a simple Sci Fi plot survival against the odds in a harsh place. Succinct and to the point proper Science Fiction. Then we get to Chronicles and while character of Riddick is much the same the Universe appears to have changed rather, elements of fantasy fiction have crept in and the focus is slipping. Scenario, the Necromongers an army of invincible warriors are spreading across the galaxy, conquering worlds and then for reasons that remain unexplained blowing them up (Seems a waste of effort). They are lead by an unbeatable warrior with unexplained mystic powers, who can only be replaced by the man that kills him. This is where the plot becomes a bit familiar. He for various reasons is opposed by the sole surviving warrior of a vanished race, only here it's Vin Diesel, not The Rock. From this point on there really isn't that much divergence in the two plots. Vin Diesels love interest suffers one of those movie clichs and doesn't make it. But guess who's sitting on the throne at the end of the movie ? You can't, better watch it then.

It's fun , but the scripting is lazy and the CGI alien worlds, somehow look less alien than outback Australia. Enjoyable, but less than it could have been.",1116460800,5,1233,4.6045454545454545
2125232,4,B0002VEUTY,"So, now we're introduced to the epic world of Riddick's universe (underverse).  I think it's a little strange now that the titles of the three movies in order go like this:  The Chronicles of Riddick:  Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury, and The Chronicles of Riddick.  Anyway, I feel that Keith David's talent and character were completely wasted in this film.  It just seems like something Paul Anderson would do (not giving anything away).  Another thing is the fact that this universe is SOOOO different from the more dirty/realistic atmosphere of the first movie, and even Dark Fury really can't explain this.  Another thing is that there's no talk of superhuman armies taking over galaxies in Pitch Black, you'd think something like that would be big news but it just sort of jumps out at us in this film.  It just feels a little too epic compared to the first movie.  Anyway, the action and special effects completely make up for this.  One thing I don't understand is why Universal releases 2 seperate versions of the films.  Theatrical and Director's Cut.  That's really dumb IMO.  Well, when the 3rd Riddick movie comes out there'll be a box set, and that's when I'll get the DVD's.",1116201600,4,1207,4.7729468599033815
2125233,3,B0002VEUTY,"I'm a girl but I'm still a huge fan of action, fantasy, martial arts and even war movies, but this one almost put me to sleep.

I have seen Pitch Black, even though this is a sequel, the story is so intertwined and a bit boring that I didn't care how it ended. I did not feel any real interest in it, no connection!

I felt like my eyes were gliding over pictures on the screen, and not much was absorbed, my eyes weren't hungry for this movie at all.

The main character is a cool guy, and he kicks ass nicely, but other than that, I felt like I lost over 2 hours of my life on this CG movie.

Most of the background was done on the computer, and it had a cheap feeling/look to it.

One thing I liked was the costumes, the Necromongers had this great medieval/meets new age warrior stuff on, and it certainly saved this from being a totally horrible experience.

Really, the simple fact of writing a review of this is putting me to sleep. It's a bit of a dozer.....",1116115200,,966,4.111702127659575
2125234,4,B0002VEUTY,"Do you like to look for holes and idiosyncrasies in plots of movies? Well, then this may not be the movie for you. My wife is that type of person, and after the movie, she could not stop talking about the plot holes. Yes, there are many.

Now, do you like all out action sci-fi a'la Fifth Element and Independence Day? Then you will love this movie. It has everything you could ask for. Tons of futuristic gadgetry, multiple planets capes, space battles and great production values. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and cleverly edited. The sound removed and replace with high-octane drum and bongo tracks. Yes, I know it does not sound good, but trust me it works.

I will liken Vin Diesels performance to that of Keanu Reeves in The Matrix. That is- he has very little dialog and the lines he does have are exactly that: one-liners. He does a great job by just using his presence.

I highly recommend this film. Just leave your wife at home.",1115942400,2,955,4.508670520231214

It was a mistake FOR ME. Apparently this is a sequel and I was missing out on the origins of the story. The definitely handicapped my understanding and enjoyment of the events protrayed. What I did see was a fairly lavish action movie with some great lines and some great stunts. It meant very little to me, however. I think I need to see the prequel to fully appreciate it.

2125236,3,B0002VEUTY,"""Convert or die"" seems to be the overall theme for this film.  ""Riddick"" will either convert you over to believing that a night-visioned, hunky, escaped murderer is a misguided savior or it'll leave you dying for a film that actually makes sense.

""The Chronicles of Riddick"" has several things working to its advantage: namely Vin Diesel and Karl Urban (Eomer of Lord of the Rings), the introduction of the galaxy's greatest scourge (Necromongers), and some of the coolest special effects I've seen in a while (the planet Crematoria comes to mind).

Set these aside, block out the stunning visuals for a moment, and look at the story itself...the plot...or plots, I should say.  There are too many things introduced in this film to really make it enjoyable for the viewer and we are left with many questions at the end.

What is it about the Furians that the Necromongers fear?  Is it their defiant attitudes and fierce natures?  If so, then how were they able to convert at least one of them to the Necro faith?

Who are the Necromongers and what exactly is the ""Underverse""?

Why did the creators of this film decide to give Riddick a tender heart for kids and Kira?

Why should we believe that Riddick isn't just a ruthless escaped convict but is, in fact, the last free survivor of a proud race of warriors and a misguided savior to boot?

The character of Riddick, as introduced in Pitch Black, is a cool one...sort of an anti-hero.  I have no problem supporting a character such as this, in fact, I prefer my ""good"" guys to have a touch of ""evil"" to them.  However, taking a great character and trying to make him super-human and give him some type of ""great destiny"" when there was nothing to indicate that he was anything other than an escaped convict when first introduced is stretching the boundaries of believability.  I'm all for character development, but to go from sinner to savior in the span of ""five years""...give me a break.

""Chronicles"" is a stunning visual scifi film and seems to have a lot of potential in the beginning.  But, the story soon becomes mired in too many subplots which are never fully resolved.  I guess that's why it was left open for a sequel, and I can only hope that the loose ends are taken care of in the next film.",1115683200,3,2260,4.582089552238806

2125238,2,B0002VEUTY,"This movie was everything Pitch black wasn't. it was neither a thriller, suspensfull, action filled, or exciting. Riddick was the only link this movie had to Pitch Black otherwise the Cronicles of Riddick fell  into a confusing unfocused tangent.
Pitch black had a  simple concept of man eating aliens threatening the survival of the remaining people on the planet and Riddick becoming the unexpected reluctant hero. The story worked and the film kept you captivated.
The Cronicles presented none of these qualities. Instead it gave us a complicated story of some unbelievable soul  stealing pirates that conquer  civilizations yet the movie never goes in depth into showing us where they came from or how they originated. We never really gained an understanding as to where Riddick came from either. All we are told is that Riddick came from a certain place that caused a threat to the leader of the conquering hoard as a result of a prophecy. How corny is that?.
This movie would have been ok had it not been linked to Pitch black however, since it was, it will be percieved as a flop since it didn't approach the high bar Pitch Black set.",1115596800,3,1141,4.776649746192893
2125239,4,B0002VEUTY,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE UNRATED WIDESCREEN EDITION

I won't spend much time on reviewing the movie itself as there are plenty here for you check out. I will do a review on the ""director's cut"" version and the DVD itself. In a nutshell COR is a combination of action sci-fi and classic serial science fiction (or ""Comic Book"" sci-fi if you prefer). In other words lots of cool action, fantastic sets, nice special effects, and decent plot development is on one side. On the other side you get cheesy names for locales and peoples (Crematoria, Hellion, The Elementals, The Necromongers), a few 2-dimensional characters, and a somewhat condensed story. This kind of content would do well in a longer run time (in spite of that being taboo in Hollywood). While it is a completely different kind of movie than the previous one, for those who loved Riddick in Pitch Black you will love him here too.

Now for the special edition. To those of you who watched the theatrical version and complained about holes in the story a lot of them get filled in this edition. With 15 minutes of new footage lots of little loose ends get tied up and a new character is introduced. The new slant might seem a bit on the mystical side for some tastes, but I felt it appropriate. There are more than a few little things added to scenes to help flesh out development and I'm glad they did that.

Probably the biggest change was the big fight scene at Crematoria. It now has more of it and the scene now has full audio sounds of guns blazing and bodies busted instead of just music like on the theatrical release. As much as I enjoy the additional footage I kinda liked the silence of the theatrical release better. What with just music playing and seeing all that mayhem it felt more dramatic and even artsy (in a ""Ballet of Death"" sort of way).

They took out the ""Back of the Bus"" dialog in one scene, which i miss. Seems like they replaced it with a ""sexy"" scene that to me is a total waste of film. Don't ask me why they decided to put such a useless scene in (if you watch you'll know what I'm talking about). At least this is the only added footage that I recall that would have been better off in the deleted scenes section.

While I won't say they fixed everything and now COR is the movie it should have been I do have to admit it felt much better watching the Unrated Edition as opposed to the Theatrical one. That might just be that I picked up more the third time around (yes I saw it twice in the theater), but then again maybe the new cut is just plain better. As for the ""unrated"" rating it's no big deal. More violence but still little to no blood and gore. Maybe a little more bad language, but it didn't seem like it. I guess it could be an R movie now, but it's a light R. If I was the one running the MPAA I would still call this a PG-13 movie.

Quality-wise Twohy makes a comment on the introduction about how you might see noticeable fluctuations where they made the cuts for the new footage, but I didn't notice any. However I didn't see it on HDTV so maybe as you get to better quality TV's and bigger screen tv's you might notice it. DVD looks great and visually crisp with the audio being just as clear.

The extras are pretty good, but I've seen better. Here's a breakdown:

Audio Commentary - It's informative but not nearly as much as I had hoped. There is a fair amount of the crew just shooting the breeze comparitively speaking. No Vin commentary, which I would have liked to have heard since he apparently put a LOT of creative effort into this movie.

Two menus - The exact same menu but with different art and stuff. An interesting diversion, but not a dealmaker.

Toombs Log - Interesting, but doesn't really give you that much insight. As a primer for the movie don't bother, but as a little character development on Toombs' side it works well enough.

Worlds or Riddick - The 360 degree view of some of the sets is not bad. The sets are pretty neat and it's nice to know they didn't go all CG like George Lucas and actually built some wonderful sets. Extra feature-wise? Again I say... I've seen better. The tiny featurette with Vin Diesel was the most informative and entertaining of this set. That little snippet should have been longer.

Documentary - A pretty good documentary for its size. Definitely the most worthwhile extra on here. Again it would be nice if they made it longer.

Deleted scenes - Some of these scenes are not only cool, but I feel would have really given more depth to the movie. Those few scenes I wish had stayed, but most are approprately taken out for whatever reason. Still as far as deleted scenes go most of them are pretty nice with only one lame duck scene that never should have gotten past the script that I recall.

Virtual Guide - Practically useless if you are looking get more insight into the Riddick universe. Doesn't really tell you anything more than what you would find out in the movie anyway.

Facts on Demand Viewing - Haven't tried it yet, but it sounds interesting. Will update when I learn more.

Riddick X-Box game - Useless if you don't have an X-Box. No trailers or other teasers for non-X'ers to see.

All in all if you liked Riddick in the theater you definitely should be getting this version. Forget the theatrical cut. There is more to love here. If you never seen Chronicles of Riddick and are a sci-fi fan of any kind I recommend renting this. If you like what you see you can always buy it later. Better yet go to one of those used DVD stores that apply credit from rental towards a purchase.",1115164800,17,5574,4.385658914728682
2125240,4,B0002VEUTY,"I see some average reviews for this and some even said it wasn't close in comparison to Pitch Black, I don't see that though, this movie was much better in my opinion. It picked up pretty good from Pitch Black, this movie was long so if they walked you through the entire ""5 years"" since Pitch Black it would've been a 6 hour movie, instead they picked up in a good spot.

Chronicles Of Riddick has a much better story than Pitch Black, TONS of special effects and eye candy that anyone will enjoy watching, the acting was better, etc. You can tell the budget was a lot bigger for this sequel and it shows. I enjoyed this movie a lot and would recommend it to anyone that likes lots of action and that sci-fi futuristic twist.",1115164800,4,726,4.299270072992701
2125241,5,B0002VEUTY,"The villains are as over the top as you can get, but it works. It's never campy. Somehow we've been led to believe that if you go that over the top, it just looks bad if it's done seriously, and while it may be true to an extent, there is a balance struck here. When I say over the top, I mean that the Necromonger flagship, The Necropolis, has a throne room in it with these gigantic thirty-foot statues depicting torture and suffering. The whole room looks like it is carved out of black stone with gold accents where needed. It's completely insane, and anyone who takes sci-fi too seriously will pull their hair out at the idea of the ships having these tortured faces and relief molded into their outer hulls.

Anyone who thinks Dr. Doom is one of the great antagonists of modern literature (as I do) will eat this up with a spoon and demand seconds... and thirds. Lord Marshal is the best kind of villain, one who believes he's right, and believes it so strongly that he's willing to lead a crusade across the universe.

Anyone who hates the idea of turning a good bad-guy into a bad good-guy will love this, as Riddick is still a criminal. Not a scary-looking, but wholly misunderstood guy who has changed and become a lovable hero. He's a friggin' killing machine. He has no ""code against killing"". He can kill you with a tea cup, and he will if you start some crap with him. You can bolt him down, arms and legs restrained, and sit on his chest holding an automatic rifle right at his face, and he'll STILL find a way to kill you!

Riddick's universe isn't a pretty one. The good guys don't win. Nice, kind, and sensitive people are usually crushed underfoot by things like the Necromongers, and those who stand up to them thinking their words alone will stop them are usually the first to die. Riddick survives because he's the ultimate killing machine. Like Conan, he's the strongest, and like Conan, he doesn't really care about good and evil. If he goes after the Necromongers, it's because they did something to him, or one of the two people he might care about.

The visuals of this movie are outstanding. Everything from the Necromongers' ships, to the planets looks amazing. The acting in most cases is about as over-the-top as the concept and designs, but not so much so that it becomes campy. The ending, also, is one of the single coolest I've seen in a long time. It could end right here and still be one of the coolest endings ever, but it still leaves room for a sequel. One in which Riddick is still an anti-hero, or where he becomes the biggest threat to the universe.",1115078400,5,2592,4.462025316455696
2125242,2,B0002VEUTY,"Oops, should be one star. Why can't we change that?

First of all, the movie itself was tedious. Watching Diesel in those goggles is painful. Hearing him deliver those lines ... more painful. Not that anyone in this movie fares much better; there is a lot of grimacing and gritting of teeth - probably a physical reaction from having to deliver those lines - while the numerous sci-fi cliches play out (the prison being the most tired of all).

But in the core of the movie, there's a surprise!

Let's see ... the guards of Helion Prime look like Christian Knights ... there's that Muslim Imam from Pitch Black ... Judi Dench talks about fire and water, air and earth, perhaps representing paganism or Greek philosophy ... or, as she says, calculation, which would be cold logic ...

Oddly enough, this movie seems to be an allegory - Darwinism's (or liberalism's) long war against religion and reason - convert to our way or die. No other faiths are allowed, as in Richard Dawkins' wildest fantasies. (Dawkins has intimated that doubters of evolutionism are evil or wicked. As Behe has pointed out, it's not a big step from saying people are wicked to doing something about that wickedness.)

The Darwinist's weapons are technological, perhaps representing their faith in science and progress. Their reasoning is soupy and, along with their faith, is quasi-religious, demanding the surrender of individual reason and choice. Conversion is not of the mind of heart, but by coercion. Join or die; like join or your career dies, like that of Virginia Steen-McIntyre, whose radiometric dates for ancient tools were a couple of hundred thousand years too old and was banned from her field of science, or the hapless graduate students who dared to write papers pointing out Darwinism's flaws.

Thus the Lord Marshall's ""Take it on faith,"" the Darwinist mantra.

The Necromongers' fascination with death mirrors the neo-liberal culture of death, and Darwinism's faith in the creative power of death. The communication device using some sort of human being brings to mind Darwinism's and Marxism's machinistic view of human life - we are just tools to spread our genes, we are just instruments of the State.

As the Lord Marshall has seen the Underverse and returned, so has Darwinism died a thousand deaths, stabbed to death by evidence (""Forbidden Archeology"" by Cremo, OOPARTS, etc.) and reason (""Darwin's Black Box"" by Behe), only to be resurrected by unreason.

2125243,4,B0002VEUTY,"...living up to and probably surpassing Pitch Black in many regards, most of all plot.  Obviously TCOR had more to work with, but you know what I mean.

  First, acting.  Not terribly good, as this B-film territory, although it is nevertheless fun and adequately original (at least Riddick is).  Karl Urban was somewhat laughable as he tried to mold his voice to match his eye shadowed looks and his wife was basically eye candy.  Colm Feore did a good job in his role, kind of a classic villain portrayal.  Alexa Davalos (the grown-up Jack) didn't remind me too much of Jack, but that was ok, 'cause she did her job as Kyrra.  Vin Diesel, though not the greatest actor out there, has improved immensely concerning his character depth and emotional rapport with the audience since joining Riddick and company; his voice is still awesome, too.

  The plot is pretty good, spanning a variety of worlds and keeping it interesting, although some underlying plotlines have been recycled from countless other moviews.  Basically, a warrior consulted a seer and found that he was to be killed by a Furian (I refuse to spell it ""Furyan"") warrior, so he launched a crusade against them, and killed them all (I think), except one, Riddick, who escaped.  Here he winds up again, and Colm Feore, the Lord Marshal and leader of the Necromongers (death-worshippers who seek the planet system known as the Underverse) is determined to kill him once and for all.  Riddick, who was basically just an escaped criminal the last two outings (Pitch Black and Dark Fury) finds he has a higher calling in the role of the entire universe, and the ending of this movie is very original and should prove interesting for the sequels to come (Vin Diesel said there would 2 more!).  TCOR is robably one of my favorite sci-fi/superhero movies I've seen, up there with Spider-Man, Hulk, Daredevil, Punisher, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Hellboy, Van Hesling, etc (ok, just about every one recently made!).

  The action and special effects look great, although Riddick doesn't seem to be hitting anything while he's fighting, his blades' power seeming to come from his ""intention"" to hit someone.

  In regard to parental reservations about this movie, there is some cleavage from both Kyrra (Alexa Davalos) and Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton, mostly her).  There is some bad language sprinkled throughout this movie, including an F-word, but is very mild in comparision to the profanity filled Pitch Black.

  Overall, a movie worth your time, at least if you like the scifi/superhero/fantasy genre.  Vin Diesel's one of the coolest action heros out there.  I have one recommendation to make: watch all three movies in order: Pitch Black first, Dark Fury second, and the Chronicles of Riddick last, so that you get the full effect and aren't wondering what happened in the prequels.

Riddick's character is different, and there are too many things that are not explained. Just thrown out there for the public to make of it what they will. Such as Riddick's feelings for Kera, or where the Necromongers came from in the first place. Why did they just of a sudden pop up in the universe? Other than that, the movie was not too bad. The actors where ok, not great, just ok. The planets where pretty cool, especially the prison on the one sun where Kera was held. But the movie certainly did not showcase the best of Vin Diesel's talents. His lines left you pretty unsure at what they where trying to get at, or why he even bothered saying them.

Definatly better than the first one however, at least you could watch it a second time without being bored because you knew the entire plot. Still, it tended to drag.

Dame Judi: You're an Oscar-winner, your talents were wasted here.

Vin Diesel: Perhaps you should have insisted on a more thoughtful plot? The plot in this movie tried to portray itself as clever, but with exchanges like ""How did you know that's what they did?"" ""Because that was my plan."" you can't expect me to take the plot seriously, can you? Vin, it's a space opera, they're all about timing, and this movie had none, and tried to cover it up with ""cleverness"". Next time, check out Star Trek II for timing lessons and a more appropriate mix of action, contemplation, big ideas, and personal sacrifice.

Thandie Newton: Finally, I am convinced that you can act. Well, your tongue can, at least, in a non-speaking role.

Karl Urban: My comment is similar to that for Judi. After The Lord of the Rings, I expected better, at least in terms of movie selections.

Nice special effects were wasted on a poorly scripted and directed movie about a man who brings down a galactic jihad. This DVD is going out for resale.",1112486400,,1284,4.541125541125541

I just watched the DVD of this film (with the director's cut put back in) and as much as I enjoyed it, I have one question (actually one problem) concerning the DVD version:

With the Director's desire to put so much back into the movie, why did he take things out that were in the theatrical version?

I first saw this movie, like most people do, in the theater and I must admit I enjoyed it very, very much. I enjoyed it so much in fact, that I remember aspects and scenes from it even now. Sad indeed when I realized that some of these scenes were not on this DVD.

For example: there was a scene just after the mercs go deep underground on Crematorium (am I spelling that right?). They witness for the first time (as do we) what happens in the main office of the slam everytime the sun rises and outside temperature quickly rises to 700. Everything in the office rattles and the thermometer gauge rises higher and higher. (You can still see a bit of this scene in the Special Effects featurette ...along with a terrific scene of the super heated atmosphere exploding around the gate that Riddick, Kyra and company later escape through on their run to the hanger)

Remembering that scene makes me wonder what else was deleted from the film that I so much enjoyed in the theater AND therefore compells me to ask the question: would it have been so terrible to leave in everything that was in the original theatrical version while adding the additional 15 minutes to this DVD version?

To this question I suspect that there won't be an answer forthcoming (except maybe, the standard, ""creative license"" one) Oh well.

All in all I am still pleased with the film; the stuff the director put back in should be considered icing on the cake (the additional scenes of the woman (apparition?) from Furya were a very nice touch)...

2125259,4,B0002VEUTY,"1st off, this is the sequel to the sleeper, cult hit Pitch Black.  HOW this is a sequel, I'm not entirely sure, other than a handful of familiar characters.  Pitch Black seemed very low budget and gave NO inkling as to what shows up in Chronicles Of Riddick.  That's not to say it's a bad movie, it's actually very good.  The special effects are top-notch and the artists who designed EVERYTHING are excellent.  Chronicles is an exciting, action-packed sci-fi flick that gives us fans a reason to love sci-fi in general.

Ok, so we visit Riddick several years later.  He's still on the run and he ends up 'employed' to fight against the Necromongers.  The who?  A race who wants to take over the universe.  They are like Star Trek TNG's Borg except they are all about death as opposed to cybernetics.  Did I mention they look very cool?  They are creepy looking, their religion is creepy, and their spaceships are creepy.

Vin Diesel is in top shape, even more bad than he was in the 1st flick and get this, he has super powers!  (not that we had ANY clue in Pitch Black, right?)  Alexa Dvalos plays Jack, now known as Kyra, and is quite a fighter herself.  There is a bit of an emotional story between the two.  Riddick apparently dropped her off (she was just a kid in Pitch Black) to be raised by other people and ended up becoming a fighting convict.  There is tension over the fact that Riddick left her and it helps make the movie deeper.

Thandi Newton plays a pretty small role, which is a bummer.  Most people will most likely remember her from Mission Impossible2.  Judi Dench and Nick Chinlund (Con Air) also show up.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The scope of it is awesome and the CGI used is perfect.  It's a pure action, popcorn, great sci-fi flick all around.  The biggest problem I have with it is the notion of it being a Pitch Black Sequel.  This movie could have been called something entirely different and been just as cool.  Or better.

You can't go into a film with a name like The Chronicles of Riddick and not know it's going to be cheesy as all get-out. If you take it in that light, it's not a bad movie at all. If you go in expecting Pitch Black, however, you're in for quite a disappointment.

All the things Twohy did wrong about Pitch Black are still here (especially the confusing rapid-fire camera-angle cutting combined with lack of storyline; the same technique used to confuse and annoy the viewer during Pitch Black's crash-landing makes an appearance at the beginning of this film, as well. In Twohy's defense, he does a much better job of it about two-thirds of the way through this film), but a lot of what was right about the first film is missing. Some of that has to do with the scope of the picture; it's much easier to build complex characters when your whole cast is seven people. Riddick has a cast of thousands, and it shows; very few characters here are more than cardboard, including some of the main characters. Judi Dench is utterly wasted here (more for lack of screen time than anything inherent in her character), and Karl Urban, as the necromonger (I mean, come on, the movie has a race called necromongers. Cheese city!) sent to kill Riddick, could have had a wonderful part. Instead, he's played as two-dimensionally as possible. Etc.

Still, if you're looking for a turn-your-brain-off action flick, you could do worse. And did you ever think you'd see Vin Diesel with hair, much less dreadlocks? **",1108944000,2,1546,4.676470588235294

It is cliche and my teenagers were laughing at it, mocking scenes. ""Oh, here's the sexy prisoner! She can't fight, but she can sure talk tuff and hide blades on her body!""

2125264,4,B0002VEUTY,"I saw this movie in the theater and again on DVD. Lemme tell ya... The unrated director's cut is much better than what was shown in the theater.

The theater version had unexplained plot devices, character and plot references that were never completely explained or left out as if the viewer would just automatically understand them. I left the theater appreciating the action and effects but generally wanting to thwap David Twohy soundly around the head for the editing.

The fact that Riddick is an unrepentent killer and the theater release of the movie was rated PG-13 should have told me something. It seems like studio interference created a movie that was dumbed-down and edited to market to a broader audience, forgetting that most action and sci-fi fans make their initial opinion of a movie by the rating alone. In short, if it's rated R, it's worth more investigation. If it's PG-13, you may as well wait for video.

So when I heard the Unrated Director's Cut was being released on DVD, I was fairly non-plussed. I mean, they were only adding a few minutes to the overall length of the movie. How much could they reveal that would actually make the movie make sense?

Was I wrong. Those few minutes (and some judicious changes to existing scenes) made a world of difference. Many of my issues with the first movie were resolved. The plot points that left most people scratching their heads were re-included in the Director's release.

I admit, it's not art. It may not even appeal to everyone. It's a bit of escapism, but now it's decently-done escapism.

Do you need to see Pitch Black before seeing this movie? Not entirely, but it's a heck of a lot easier to understand some of the inter-relationships if you do. (The whole thing with Imam and Jack/Kyra is lost without PB.)

Do you need to see Dark Fury before seeing this movie? No, not at all. But it's some nice escapism too.

For the ladies in the group that just want some nice eye-candy, it's got that. For those that like explosions and vivid action sequences, it's got that too.

2125278,4,B0002VEUTY,"While this is supposed to be a sequel to PITCH BLACK, it really doesn't have that feel to it. I liked this movie, not as well as PITCH BLACK (which may someday hit ""classic"" status), but as a movie in it's own right. The sets and special effects were extremely effective and well done.

I loved Diesel in PITCH BLACK. Then xXx came along and I was very disappointed in the movie and his performance. Same for A MAN APART. It seemed for a bit that unless he was a supporting actor (KNOCKAROUND GUYS, BOILER ROOM, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) the movies weren't really good. Maybe it was just bad choices on his part, or producers rushing to cash in on what they saw in PITCH BLACK. I don't know.

At least with CHRONICLES you get an idea of what Diesel can do when given the opportunity and a decent script. The storyline was good, Judy Dench was great (as usual), and Diesel was perfect. I wish they'd used the original girl instead of bringing in someone so pretty. I liked the original. She'd have been just fine.

Like STAR WARS you get a better image of this movie on the big screen. Still, it's worth owning, worth seeing, worth writing a review about.",1106697600,,1149,4.384976525821596

I seriously think this should have been a parody of sci-fi and fantasy because this movie is THAT BAD.  Pitch Black was great but for this ""sequel"" they basically rewrote the Riddick character to fit into this jumbled mess of a movie.  The acting was laughable.  The story was ridiculous and it stole from movies like Star Wars, Star Trek, LOTR, Escape from New York, forget about it.  I don't want to continue listing because I think you should get the point.  Don't waste any $$$ or time on tis steaming pile of crap.  You might as well call Vin Diesel's career dead or on the same level as Seagal and Van Damme.

It could have been so good, if only the'd done a bit more reasoning and a bit less wandering around.

Riddick is living alone on an ice world when bounty hunters chase him down - blah, blah - the plot gets complicated (unnecessarily so) from there on out. Oh, I SO want to fix this movie.

2125284,4,B0002VEUTY,"Nope, this is not your standard sequel to a successful movie. The Chronicles of Riddick is based on the characters from Pitch Black, but the story is not really building on the events of Pitch Black.

In addition, the pace and the setup of the Chronicles are a bit different than in Pitch Black. This time it's all about Riddick (or should we say Vin?) and the movie is more action oriented. There are quite many physical fight scenes and an intense race against time (the rising sun).

While some reviewers complain about a missing plot, this is not really true. The plot is simple, straight forward and perfectly in line with the theme of the movie: fallen soon-to-be hero fights back. The scenes (locations) are spectacular, the CG is impressive and even the acting is solid. The outdoor (and brief outer space) scenes with the Necromonger ships and the Necromonger  invasion to Helion Prime is rendered beautifully and do a good job of visualizing the colossal power of this Son-of-Borg species. The three pictured planet (UV something, Helios Prime and Crematoria) look all very different and still fit the general tone of the movie very well.

Some complains that apply to almost all sci-fi movies apply here as well. The villains have been seen before (as mentioned above: the Borg) and, although I think the plot is appropriate for a move of this kind, it still is way too simple and constructed (Riddick after a series of surprising turns: ""It was my plan"") and how come he always shows up at the right place at the right time? But hey, it's an entertaining movie and not a documentary.

2125287,5,B0002VEUTY,"It takes a lot of work to make a film; it takes even more work to make a good film, one that has a decent storyline and enough memorable lines and events, even characters, and it takes an incredible amount of dedication and sheer talent to create something that transcends the film, it's series, and grabs a person in a way that leaves an indelible mark on their soul. Never, in my life, would I have expected this to have come in the form of an action film, but it has. The Chronicles of Riddick is a masterpiece. The sets, the art, the soundtrack, the lines, the characters, even the concepts, are so detailed, so elegant and masterful, that it blows away almost every other competitor completely. It's storyline is so fulfilling, so rich and delicious, that it allows the film to pull free from it's action-packed, gritty, and violent roots to become something not unlike Frank Herbert's own Dune. A masterwork, at the very least.

 Vin Diesel shines in The Chronicles of Riddick, far outdoing his performance in what amount to lesser films, such as Rob Cohen's The Fast and the Furious, and even Chronicle's sequel, Pitch Black. He plays an endlessly astounding and incredibly enigmatic convict, a ""Furian"" known only as Riddick, whose major talent seems to be for attracting trouble, and flawlessly avoiding it. Co-starring in the film is the amazing Colm Feore, a powerful, moving speaker who plays the endlessly powerful ""Lord Marshall,"" leader of the evil, destructive, and hell-bent faction known as the Necromongers, men and women who ""convert those they do not kill.""

If you're a fan of science fiction, action films, or even if you just need a good film to watch, I definitely recommend The Chronicles of Riddick. If any film is worth watching, renting, even owning, this one is.",1104624000,2,1792,4.811688311688312

The Chronicles of Riddick however, find Diesel and writer/director David Twohy in the center of a glorified B-movie with A plus special effects, and the character development of Diesel's Riddick, which really attempted to go somewhere in Pitch Black, gets thrown out the window here.  Riddick finds himself with a massive bounty on his head, and he is also thrown into a full scale war with a fascist master race bent on, what else, domination of the universe.  Colm Feore provides an antagonistical villain, while Lord of the Rings' Karl Urban is given a meaty role, and Thandie Newton and Judi Dench are wasted in their roles.  The CGI effects are spectacular, but Diesel proves to be the biggest special effect of them all; flexing his way towards a forseeable conclusion that leaves the door open for another ""Chronicle"".  This is the franchise that Diesel chose over his profitable XXX film, and even though I don't expect much from anything with Vin Diesel as the main attraction, I did expect something more from David Twohy.

They took a good premise a good movie and ruined it all in the last five minuites.  Vin might as well forget about a third Riddick cause the character has lost his edge and now leads an army of idiots.  Yeah sure I had no problem with the death of the Holy Man but why would you kill Jack(Kyra).  Throughout the movie it seemed like the could have taken the Riddick character to another level but it seemed throughout the movie that Vin was fighting the character trying to make him something he shouldn't be.

  However I kind of liked that whole thing it served the story well but not the character of Riddick.  I loved the relationship between Riddick and Kyra throughout the movie it is the one thing that I can say was done well.  The problem I do have is they killed Kyra(Jack) in such a way that it was overshadowed by Riddick's assention to lord of the Necro's.

  In the end they took Riddick the ultimate Anti-Hero one of the great movie characters and made him a useless Tragic Hero almost Greek Tragedy type of hero.  Point being if you liked Pitch Black at all don't and I repeat don't watch this movie.  Well I guess I'll just watch Batman if I want to see a Tragic Hero who ultimatly is useless.",1104451200,,1223,4.330396475770925
2125291,3,B0002VEUTY,"I actually love this movie mostly because of the story backdrop and special effects.  The special effects is just insanely great.  They put a lot of effort into the sets and CG effects.  They pulled it off really well in a big way.

And the wierd medieval allure of the necromongers and mysterious magical-like technology and culture really add substance to the universe.  The movie creators did an outstanding job.  I hope they can make more movies, and even consider using their magic to make some Dune flicks. :-)

I am not a big fan of Vin Diesel roles, but it works well for the Riddick character.  It seems the character and Vin Diesel were made for each other.  Nick Chinlund as the mercenary Tombs was done really well.  If only a slight small complaint, I wish there was more engagement in to the universe, and I felt there was a too much emphasis and spotlight in such these characters.

My biggest complaint though is not much with the movie itself (4 stars), but rather with the annoying DVD media (1 star).  For one they included this demo of video game.  On an X-Box, we COULD NOT WATCH THE MOVIE, but the video game worked. :-\  However, on the Sony Playstation 2, we were able to actually WATCH the movie.  What I really despise about many DVD movies, is that they FORCE you to watch commercials, and this DVD is no exception.

I would recommend if you have a DVD burner, to burn this movie without the fluff, and watch the copy.  We should be able to simply watch movies we pay for, without the promos and commercials.

Conclusion, great movie with great special effects and universe backdrop, e.g. Necromongers.  DVD media with its promos and adverts is really lammo.",1104451200,2,1685,4.556666666666667
2125292,5,B0002VEUTY,"Even if I have to apologize to my Friends and Favorites, and my family, I have to admit that I really liked this movie.  It's a Sci-Fi movie with a ""Mad Maxx"" appeal that, while changing many things, left Riddick from `Pitch Black' to be just Riddick.  They did not change his attitude or soften him up or bring him out of his original character, which was very pleasing to `Pitch Black' fans like myself.

First off, let me say that when playing the DVD, the first selection to come up is Convert or Fight, and no explanation of the choices.  This confused me at first, so I will mention off the bat that they are simply different menu formats, that each menu has the very same options, simply different background visuals.  Select either one and continue with the movie.

Chronicles Of Riddick takes place after Riddick's escape from the planet of monsters on Pitch Black, starting out with his recapture after being in hiding for many years.  Now we are going to get a glimpse of just what is going on in the universe during the futuristic time frame of `Pitch Black'.

A large sect of religious fanatics called Necromongers are moving from planet to planet, converting others to their faith and killing those who will not convert.  Necromongers are half-dead beings from many different original planets, kind of like Star Trek's Borgs except they do not loose their individuality when they are converted.  Some are made into ""Lensors"", very cool effect of once-humans with these round blue shields over their faces, under which their faces look a little skeletal and decomposed.

Riddick gets caught up with the Necromongers after he is taken to the prison planet of Crematoria, where daylight, rather than nightfall, is the killer.  Here he finds a grown up Jack (the girl from Pitch Black), now using her real name of Kyra.  The girl Jack was a strong addition to Pitch Black, the adult Kyra is rather whiney and annoying, and my one complaint would be that they should have done better with Jack's development.  He has to escape Crematoria and help Jack off the planet also.

Truthfully, the entire plot is Riddick running from people who want to capture him, but it's still a good movie made interesting with the addition of the half-dead race.  The Lady Vaako of the Necromongers is a very `Cleopatra' type of character, with her own Marc Anthony in the form of Vaako, one of the Lord Marshal's fiercest warriors.

In some of the scenes the Necromongers almost come across like Televangelists, wanting converts so badly, and desiring entire populations to kneel before them.  Just a funny comparison to mull over while you watch.  There is also an Elemental in the movie, a race of beings who can phase in and out of dimensions, whose job it seems to be not to inform the Necromongers but to distract them from Riddick, at least that is the feeling that I got.

The special effects of this movie make up for the slower parts about three quarters of the way through the movie, stunning visuals of cities that are half gothic and half futuristic, great flight scenes (including a cool shot of the underbelly of one of the ships), the sunrise over the planet Crematoria is spectacular (but not quite as good as the nightfall effect in Pitch Black), the power going out all over the city, the half metal-half squishy mind readers, and that is barely skimming the effects.

The costume and set designs are visually stunning, well made without going too far over the top, and the editing is not as choppy as David Twohy warns us about at the beginning of the Director's Cut.

My one other problem is that with a loss of midrange hearing, I had to use the English Subtitles to hear some of the conversations, so if you are slightly hard of hearing you will want to use that feature.  The battles are rapid and a bit confusing during the use of strobe lighting, but that is what the slow-mo button is for. ;-)

All in all, this is a pleasing sci-fi adventure movie, not to be confused with a work of art or a lesson in any socially redeeming values.  It is good old-fashioned fun and a relief to us sci-fi fans who tire of critics blathering on about how sci-fi and fantasy are not worthy forms of entertainment.  These are the same critics who thought The English Patient was a good movie. (gag)

As the Necromongers say, ""Humans are an unguided mistake.""

Enjoy the movie!",1104105600,100,4375,4.6248382923674

In this movie, he has almost super-human powers it seems, able to mow down dozens of Necromongers at a time.  As for the look of the movie, a bigger budget doesn't necessarily mean a better movie.  Everything is on a grand scale and some of scenary is awesome (but some isn't so great).  Also, the two other surviving characters from ""Pitch Black"" are killed off in this installment, one early on, the other at the end (boo!)  All in all, Twohy should have taken much more time to tell us this story (2 hours plus a few minutes just isn't enough), too much is crammed in.

2125296,4,B0002VEUTY,"4.5 stars.  It has been a long time since I've seen a Science Fiction film as ambitious and pumped with adrenaline as this one.  The huge sets and spectacular special effects are glorious, and the cast contains some interesting and highly memorable characters.  Although, this film is certainly not for everyone.  Those who expect perfection will be summarily disappointed; but those who don't mind the occasional flaw as long as the story moves forward at a brisk and entertaining pace should be enthralled.  I love reading epic Sci-fi novels that encompass multi-culture conflicts on a variety of planets host to a multitude of characters whose presence lingers on long after the final page is turned.  That is what has been accomplished here: the ultimate in Space Opera laced with fantastic action sequences and a lead character you just can't take your eyes off of.  There are many film influences apparently ""borrowed"" for this story, such as ""Dune,"" ""Star Trek,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" and even a few excellent ideas practically stolen from the animated film ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.""  The integration of all these sources should collide but they instead merge into an intoxicating brew of dazzling visuals and non-stop action sequences.  There is a scene in this film that I want to relate, in part, due to the fact it reminded me of another great scene from ""The Pianist"" which won the Oscar for Best Director for Roman Polanski.  In ""The Pianist"" there is a scene where a tank fires a shell into the vacinity of the main character and explodes; all of a sudden the sound cuts out except for a high-pitched tone and muffled footfalls leaving the viewer with an unprecedented feeling of being in same room.  In ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" director David Twohy uses a similar idea as an explosion hits and the entire battle is silenced, the score is absent, and all that can be heard is the muffled sound of armored soldiers crashing against the rocks.  It was another remarkable sample taken and seamlessly woven into the framework of this wholly under-rated film.  To get more background information on a couple of the characters in this film, especially Riddick, it is a good idea to check out the film ""Pitch Black"" first.  Both films are worth owning, this sequel starting up the story five years after ""Pitch Black"" ends.  This is a thoroughly entertaining film filled with fine action sequences, superb special effects, and an epic tale that spans three planets and all the space between.

2125297,2,B0002VEUTY,"I liked the movie...when I saw it in the theater.  I was incredibly disappointed with the Unrated Edition.  I might have liked it better if I hadn't seen the original.

The unrated Edition changes the movie too much.  Some of the new footage makes some things make more sense, but it also changes the story too much in my mind.  Some new footage makes the scenes too long and extremely dull.  It's like listening to someone talk a lot and say nothing.

They may have added footage, but they have taken a lot out as well.  They have taken out some of the great one-liners.  They have rearraged some of the dialogue.  Once again changing the movie too much.

If you really enjoyed the theatrical version, don't get the unrated version.  If you haven't seen the original, this one might be enjoyable for you.",1103414400,,805,4.513888888888889
2125298,1,B0002VEUTY,"You know, when you hear they're making a sequel to a movie like Pitch Black (which I loved), your first reaction is, ""Cool!"" and then you think, ""I hope they don't screw it up."" Well, they screwed it up.

""Pitch Black"" had a simple plot, believable characters, and an element of tension that never let up. This movie had cool costumes, nice scenery, a simple plot made needlessly confusing in an effort to be ""important,"" one-dimensional, stereotypical characters and really, really bad names for things. And Vin Diesel, of course.

Once again, he's our anti-hero Riddick, pursued by bounty hunters then enlisted to take on the evil invading ""Necromongers."" The Necromongers capture him, realize he's dangerous and, naturally, have to take him into the heart of their flagship to have a closer look. Yeah, that's what I'd do with a dangerous enemy if I were a one-dimensional comic book villain. Not.

They have to bring him into their ship to be examined by some kind of giant beetle-like creatures whose purpose is never explained and which you barely get a clear look at (because when you can see them clearly, they probably look a lot like big fake rubbery giant beetles). The bugs declare Riddick dangerous indeed and, since they can communicate in that annoying hissy echo-whisper voice the movies use to indicate that evil creatures are speaking telepathically, they insist that he must be destroyed!

But, before that edict can be carried out, Riddick somehow escapes and gets whisked away by the bounty hunters again. This time, they take him to the prison world ""Crematoria"" for the sole purpose of having him get sweaty during some ""Pitch Black"" style cross-country racing against time. (This was the best part of the movie, by the way. Too bad about the other 9 hours worth of misery.) Only this time, the enemy is the sun. Seems the planet's surface heats up to 700 degrees in the daylight, immolating anyone who doesn't happen to be standing in the shade or just inside the mouth of a cave. Apparently, convection doesn't work on this planet.

Finally, Riddick has to get back for his eventual showdown with the bad guys. I won't tell you how that turns out because you'll need a reason to stay awake once the interesting bits on ""Crematoria"" are over with. That and the fascinating action sequences where the camera wobbles around and everything gets blurry so you have to really pay attention to tell what's going on. Man I loved those.

I could complain more (about the campy-vampy ambitious chick, for example, or Judy Dench's weird character who seemed to be there only to add the illusion of class to the film), but I've already wasted enough time on this movie. I'm going to watch ""Pitch Black"" again to remind myself how much I really liked it, and try to forget I ever saw this mess.",1103068800,12,2806,4.7633744855967075

Are holiday shoppers pushing and shoving their way to the front of the check out line without conscience? Right in front of you! Can you believe the madness?

""The Chronicles of Riddick"" continues the story of a Furian boldly named Riddick (Vin Diesel). Riddick from ""Pitch Black"" fame emerges from hiding due to an aggressive, money hungry bounty hunter Toombs (Nick Chinlund). Riddick slashes his way back into the limelight on the planet Helion Prime. He confronts a world conquering Lord Marshal (Colm Feore), a Necromonger, who is trying to assimilate planets into his Underverse way of life. The Necromongers are ""Death from above"" brainwashed assimilated, conquered planet members. (What's that?)

Riddick jumps to the forefront to help save the world from being conquered. With his night vision sight and unfazed confidence, Riddick fights his way to the final showdown. (Sight unseen)

This movie has awesome special effects and fight scenes. The very hot, hot Crematoria planet jail escape is like putting your hand in a freezer for an hour, then in a butane blue torch flame.

2125300,3,B0002VEUTY,"Going for a vastly more grand scale than either ""Pitch Black"" or ""Dark Fury"". ""Chronicles Of Riddick"" hinges the fate of the universe on resisting the advances of a huge militaristic/twisted religious sect called the Necromongers who are overrunning entire planets, with a survivor from the first film, now politically influential, attempting to recruit Riddick to help with the battle.  Some have complained of a relative lack of story here; Ill take the opposite track and submit that there's a LOT of story, it just gets swamped by the constant rocket-fast pace.  I mean, what we have here is a story that should have been about 4-and-a-half hours, but running somewhere around two hours (and to think that the theatrical movie was actually 16 minutes shorter than the DVD!) it's got more angles packed in more tightly than ""Star Wars Episode 1"", to the point where the story actually does get in danger of disappearing from sight.  This is one you're really going to have to pay attention to in order to make sense of.  It's packed with some of the best and most dynamic action scenes ever (although sometimes of tenuous believability), but if the characters and multiple plotlines had been given proper screentime to develop, not only would they themselves have added to the movie but the action scenes themselves would have been more potent.  The tenuous believability is also a hampering effect at times.  Occasionally the movie straddles (thankfully briefly) the line of camp, which was definately Not the case with the first two.  It's like it's so big it just got away from the filmmakers a couple of times there.

  This isn't a bad movie by any means though, it's just not as great as it should have been.  If giving it three stars seems like it's a putdown it's not; when stuck between giving a movie 3 or 4 stars I think what I'd give it on a tenpoint scale (an extremely inexact science, because I think movies are hard to quantify with a numerical value) and this is a good 6.5 to 7.  Some reviewers I've noticed (not a criticism, just an observation) will say a movie is pretty terrible and then still give it 3 or even 4 stars; I guess it all depends on how good you think an 'average' movie is what would be signified by each rating.  In my view, based on everything I've seen in my life from the worst to the best, the 'average' movie (2.5 stars or 5 Of 10) is still pretty watchable, and I place ""Chronicles Of Riddick"" well above average. It's just not as great as it could have been, or as great as ""Pitch Black"" or ""Dark Fury"".

  I hope there's a sequel (before this came out I think I heard some where they wanted to do Three more after this) because, without giving anything away, it's wide open for sequelization, (having had a terrific twist ending that opens u a universe of possibilities) and could build on the strengths of all the films so far, including this one, and sidestep the slips in this one, perhaps with a longer running time.  If it's not financially feasible to do another mega-budget live-action one like this there are a number of less expensive routes they could take: original novels; animated features (actually I want more Dark Fury-type animated entries regardless); comic books; etc.  The series is too good to end on a slightly off-kilter note.",1102982400,,3298,4.647160068846816
2125301,4,B0002VEUTY,"If you take only one thing away from watching this movie, it should be that Vin Diesel thinks rather highly of himself.

If you take two things away from watching this movie, the second might be that Thandie Newton's performance (She's so Goth, she's dead!) is the kind of acting that a drag queen would be proud to make part of a stage show, a la Joan Crawford at her most flamboyant.

If you take three things away from this movie, third should be that the filmmakers ought to have decided exactly what ""The Underverse"" is, and what capabilities it gives the bad guys. They should have decided exactly what a lot of stuff was, and why, upon reflection.

The fourth thing would be that dialogue again, which tries for hip and hard-boiled and lands somewhere southeast of 50's Juvie dramas, which is to say it achieves unintentional hilarity at times. A sample: ""It's been a long time since I smelled beautiful,"" Vin tells Thandie while she prances around him.

Fifth would maybe be that Judi Dench plays a gaseous human about as well as can be played (except for the classic Japanese horror film The Human Vapor, or by Brando), not that she looks like she's enjoying the experience.

Sixth would be that the main baddie should have quit fooling around and just offed Vin when he had the chance, because, after all, Vin probably screenplay approval and didn't want to see himself die after he had worked so hard to make himself seem like the baddest dude in the galaxy.

A fun movie for a variety of legitimate AND silly reasons, lots of action, lots of FX, lots of 'splosions, very little sense is made of any of it. Watch it with some drunk friends and have your own MST3K riffing party.

To say that the movie is 'action packed' would not do it justice since many of the so called action packed flicks that I have seen recently only displsy action at the box office ticket counter! Same thing with 'special effects' .... trust me ... you haven't seen special effects until you pop this DVD into the player.

I am giving this a 5 star rating because of the nonstop action.  It would be hard pressed to find special effect any better.  The computer graphics are the best.

I must say Vin does his role as Riddick quite well.  He has this movie franchise down to a science.  Riddick in this movie as you could predict gets his way in this one.  However I felt a little flat on Riddick bridging the cultures.  Riddick does have those senses, (let alone those eyes) to be persuasive.  There are a few tense moments on his female killer cohort to put you at the end of your seat.  As a rule I am not into Sci-Fi much but this movie was so futuristic it could make me wanting more.  This is definately a good VS evil movie.  If we get that way in future as we colonize space type dimensions, leave me home.  It made the future look so bleak, and violent.  Although with military gear going more high tech, than from actual brawn one can see the future in this movie today.  Some of the battleship used looked alot like star wars, with a cross with the space shuttle.

I really think that Hollywood sometimes influences some breakthroughs in military technology.  There is even a show called Tactical To Practical on cable.  I do feel as we keep screwing with Biosphere 1, (the earth) we will colonize space.  There will battles there as well up in space.  I only hope by then we'll learned our lessons here to make a better Biosphere 2, and beyond.  In this movie to there was even obligatory sci-fi brand of erotica.

Unfortunatelly, here they can and they do.

After the first 10 minutes of this thing I was ready to go to sleep. It did not get much better afterwards. I guess making good movies is not that easy.

2125313,5,B0002VEUTY,"I am among those who The Chronicles of Riddick so I jumped at the chance to have the director's cut of the film, which includes 15 additional minutes.  The new footage may not be noticed by everyone but it does make a subtle difference.  For example, Kyra (Riddick's love interest) in introduced by a short sequence of her arrival at the planet prison Cremitoria.  The scene helps the viewer to connect later references to her before Riddick ends up at the prison.

The reviews here are sharply divided into those who like the film and those who don't see anything good in it.  The story is similar to other plot lines: an unscrupulous militaristic master race is taking over world after world and stripping it of resources.  They are also a group that forces the conquered people to become one of them.  This sounds something like a cross between Independence Day and Star Trek.  The Chronicles of Riddick has some very impressive special effects.  The Necromongers travel in space ships with anthropomorphic figures that lend them a coldness befitting military conquerors.  The ghost-like quality of Judi Dench's character is very well done as are the lightening quick movements of the Lord Marshall.  Calling this a realization of a lavish graphic novel is close to the mark.

The performances are good: Vin Diesel does a fine job as the Furian anti-hero; Colm Feore (as he is usually cast) makes a fine villain.  It was interesting for me to see Karl Urban as Vaako out of his Lord of the Rings makeup and Thandie Newton was a nice addition as his ambitious wife.  Judi Dench may be thought wasted in Riddick but must we compare her performance in this film to something like Shakespeare in Love?  Judging by what she said about making the film, Ms Dench had a lot of fun.  And, yes, Vin Diesel does wear goggles, but the reason he wears them is part of his character not just a mindless prop.  In other supporting roles, Nick Chinlund, who plays the leader of the mercenaries that capture Riddick, does a great job as the indecisive and sleazy Toombs.

I don't think critics care much for movie that just seeks to entertain.  So I can recommend this movie for the wild ride that it is - just plain fun.",1102377600,3,2207,4.627249357326479

2125317,4,B0002VEUTY,"This is an interesting followup to the Pitch Black movie.  A movie that was probably designed to be standalone, but generated such a cult following of the classic antihero Riddick, that producers were screaming for a followup.  Though it definitely suffers from plot oriented flaws,, it seems to survive all of them and end up being a highly enjoyable movie.

Goths are conquering the universe.  Well not technically speaking, but a group called the Necromongers, a strange theocracy are going planet to planet and forcing others to either submit to their ideals and join them, or die. They are preparing to go and conquer their version of the holy lands called the ""underverse"".  Their leader""the grand marshal"" has been there and returned something not quite human.  There is a rumor that a Furion will defeat them.  But that seems unlikely since the Necromongers killed them all off.

This is where Riddick enters.  He has been on remote planets to escape from bounty hunters.  When a group of hunters finally catch up with him he returns to civilization to figure out how they found him so easily.  So he goes to find the one person he told where he was going, a familar face from the last movie.  Then he discovers that it is more than just law departments looking for him.  He is apparently a child of destiney, though this is a destiney that he wants no part of.

This was a highly enjoyable movie.  It suffered from some flaws that slowed it down a bit.  The bad guys get little explanation, they are shown as fanatics, highly organized, possibly brainwashed, and high tech.  The Lord Marshal is shown to be supernatural in some way, but his character unfortunately doesn't get much screen time.

A lot of characters aren't developed as they should be, making them seem more like plot devices than people.

The plot seems pretty thin, but it feels as though there is going to be a sequel.  It is practically implied in the name, chronicles of riddick.

But overall the movie succedes in being a good action film, and science fiction.  The special effects and cinematography are all top notch.  The action sequences are well filmed and exciting.  Plus Vin Diesel is in top form as Riddick.  Who is offically in the ranks of classic anti heroes(ie: snake plisken, Han Solo, Leon the Professional, Frank Castle, and Blade).  The humor is dark and the characters gritty and mostly believable.  In short, watch it, you won't be moved, but you will enjoy the ride.",1102032000,,2466,4.727699530516432

That being out of the way, I really liked The Chronicles of Riddick. While some of the story is vague in explanation and depth, this is likely because David Twohy is partly expecting fans to have played the Xbox game, and/or to have seen the animated bridge Dark Fury. This isn't what I would call unreasonable, although I must admit that people who haven't experienced as much as they can out of the Riddick series will probably be left scratching their heads. The movie itself was stellar, in my opinion. The sets, acting, script, and production were all faithful to the first film, Pitch Black, which if you haven't seen yet, I advise you to run to the local rental store and grab it. This movie is far grander in scale than Pitch Black. Not better... not worse either. Just bigger. This is clearly a reflection of the high production values that were absent in PB, and I should add that I feel that often high-value sequels lose much of the unique indie feel of their lower-budget predecessor(s), and subsequently their quality, but this is handled tastefully and intelligently in COR. The movie, in case you don't already know, involves the character of Riddick (Vin Diesel) being dragged into a resistance against the massive galactic conquest by a race of religious fanatics under the rule of a Stalin-like tyrant. Not hugely original, but neither was PB, and both movies handle their derivitive features in an extremely competent fashion, and both, of course, benefit greatly from the addition of one of the most intense bad-guy-heroes in movie history. I absolutely recommend the film to anyone who likes any facet or sub-genre of action movies.

2125328,3,B0002VEUTY,"I normally hate to compare a film to its sequel(s), but for Chronicles of Riddick I will have to because it just doesn't stand on its own.  Having an understanding of the back story from Pitch Black is necessary to navigate through this choppy  plot - but since I assume that a large portion of viewers will be purchasing this film expecting a continuation of the characters and quality from that movie, I think it is my duty to point out how very much COR deviates.

COR takes place several years after the events in PB.  Riddick has been on the run from various people in that time, but at the opening of the film he is running from bounty hunters hired by a private party for a very choice sum.  Of course Riddick has to find out who and why, which takes him across space to look up an old friend.  Coincidentally, that very planet is attacked shortly after he arrives.  It would seem that an evil death-worshipping religion has been sweeping the universe, killing all who will not convert, and a rogue being called an Elemental has purposefully lured Riddick there so that she can enlist his help in fighting them.  Through various flashbacks and offhand remarks from other characters we learn that Riddick is one of the few survivors of a race from the planet Furia which was also devastated by the Necromags, so naturally, he'd want revenge, right?  And of course he can be expected to singlehandedly defeat an evil empire if he wanted to.  But Furions are also contrarians, and Riddick is a confirmed loner, baby.  He can't be tied down, has to be free, blah blah.  But then the Necromongers annoy him by killing his pal, so watch out, now it's personal!

I think that fans of PB will find that the pace, plot and tight storytelling of that first film is absent here.  COR shifts focus constantly, jumping around visions and events and leaving holes in the plot which I can only assume are due to bad editing.  The story tries to take on too much subject matter - a whole occultic warrior culture, Riddick's conflicted relationship with Jack/Kira from PB, the mysteries of Furia, Furions, and the race of Elementals - in too short a time.  I'm not any dumber than the average viewer, but this was a very confusing experience for me.

By far the thing that threw me the most was how differently the character of Riddick was portrayed by the same actor in this film  Our anti-hero lost his mystery and much of his appeal this time around.  Vin Diesel was chilling and unfathomable in PB; now he starts to seem like any other super alpha male on an ultraviolent killing rampage.  Oh yes, there's lots of that going on, but this time humans compose the body count instead of monsters.  Riddick is now a modern action movie clich&eacute;.  I found it hard to root for him.

The most impressive part of COR was evident in the high-budget art direction.  The set and costume designs for the Necromongers were convincingly dark and beautiful in the tradition of Giger (Alien/Aliens).  The special effects were good, the fiery scenes on the surface of the planet Crematoria were believable.  Lots of eye candy to be had.

The end of this film strongly suggests that there is an opening for another sequel in the works.  Gads, I hope not...unless the editor can get his act together.  I suspect that the director's version  of COR is better than this theatrical release, and that maybe the third film will learn from the mistakes of the second.  My advice:  if you are still fan enough of Riddick to brave COR, check out the director's cut and skip this one.

I'm a big science fiction fan but there isn't many movies that I really like however I really, really liked this. Can't really compare the original and this one because they are totally different. chronicles of riddick is sort of a cross between Dune and Star Wars but with characters and special effects that are a lot more entertaining than either one of those movies.

2125330,4,B0002VEUTY,"I think the Riddick character is great and this movie goes into much more detail on his origins.

It was interesting to see how the kid from Pitch Black grew up into a similar ""animal"" called Kyra.  Unfortunately, she and just about everybody else wind up dead before the movie ends.  The only character that is still around for Part III is Riddick.

The Necromongers are overdone.  The ""verse"" and ""under verse"" part confused me.  Seems like the writers could have come up with a better set of bad guys.

Overall, it's a good Sci-Fi flick.  Not the same quality as Pitch Black, but they compensated with really expensive special affects.  Personally, I would have preferred less of the effects and more focus on the story.",1101254400,,723,4.674603174603175
2125331,3,B0002VEUTY,"Decent sci-fi flick. I watched the directors cut which has 15 extra minutes of scenes that were deleted from the theatrical version. I haven't seen the theatrical version yet. I like the Riddick character. That character made the movie Pitch Black. Compared to Pitch Black, I thought this story was weaker. The Necromongers aren't believable characters. Their culture and religion are out there. I couldn't figure out if they were supposed to be dead people walking around or if they were half-dead or what. I just couldn't figure out what they were other than a race of conquerors. Some of the stuff Riddick does is pretty cool. His character is larger than life. However, he was a bit superhuman in this movie. Some of the fight scenes are overdone. Poor writing and directing in my opinion. He's supposed to be a real bad ass, not a circus performer. So, I have to give it a mediocre rating for that stuff. The special effects were good. But then you have to be a real buffoon to get that wrong these days. Overall, the movie is worth seeing for the Riddick character. Maybe Vin can get better writers next time. Thandie is hot all dressed up in tight outfits. But her part is woefully underwritten. She is a far better performer than that. Alexa Davalos is great as Kyra. She played the role well. One fight scene has her whipping her feet at Necro's while she is twisting in the air. When the twisting is over and it is time for her to land, you, the audience, can easily see that she is being lifted by an apparatus. That is just poor editing. If the story and the writing had been better, it wouldn't have mattered.

I didn't like the commercial stuff included with the DVD. True, I can ignore it if I don't want it. Too many trailers and advertisements. I like the extra bonus features though. That stuff is always a fantastic inclusion in a DVD. They even included the first level of The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay Xbox game. To bad I don't have an Xbox.

My suggestion is wait till the price comes down before buying Chronicles of Riddick.

I enjoyed this movie. My wife didn't.  Says a lot about my taste in movies. A lot of things blew up.",1101168000,,416,4.608108108108108
2125333,5,B0002VEUTY,"Ever since Pitch Black I became a huge Vin Diesel fan enjoying the movie that had the unique concept of fighting evil with evil or the idea of the anti hero if you will.

The Chronicles of Riddick takes place some five years after the events of Pitch Black (side note: If you want to know what happened following the events of Pitch Black check out the short animation ""The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury"") where Riddick has lived a life of isolation on a planet of ice until mercs show up one day looking to reap the rewards of Ridicks bounty but what they get is Riddick at his best, a guilt free killer.  Riddick gathers information that leads him to New Mecca to confront the Holy Man from the first film who put up the bounty of 1.5 million for his capture.  As the movie unfolds we see many sides to Riddick, caring, sensitive, and of course flat out bad ass.  But we also learn of his past, the true origin of his eye shine, and many more details I won't give away.  If you loved Pitch Black or Vin Diesel in general this movie is a must see.

A note on the directors cut, I first saw this film in theatres and some things seemed to be missing and you could almost tell things had been cut out to fit into the two hour time window but with 15 minutes of restored footage to the film it actually feels complete and is more satisfying that why I'm endorsing the ""Unrated Directors Cut"" vs. the original theatrical release.

I'm not making this up, three-headed phallic ships that crash tip first into the ground, then spurt out a blue-white ball of power.  Tell me this screen writer doesn't have some issues.

Pitch Black was a good-enough hard science fiction story that did a watchable job of shoehorning a group of people into a pretty crappy situation, and then getting a few of them back out.  This sequel abandons the hard sci-fi premise of the first outing for an undescribed, inconsistent, unwatchable goon-fest of ""Battlefield Earth"" proportions.  Lots of angry simpering and posing and preening by the bad guys.  No real explanation of why anything works the way it does, yet it's still very predictable.  Its apparently some kind of death cult demanding total obedience, but if you change your mind, well that's OK too.

There's alot of ""subtlety"" in how things are named.  There are these guys called Necro-mongers (they're the bad guys)  Judy Densch who just kind of floats around (she's an elemental) and then there's Riddick.  He's a ""Furyan"".  Guess why.  Yeah! 'cause he's furious.  Get it!

I based my buying decision, in part, on what I remembered of Pitch Black (some of which I enjoyed) and some of the positive

reviews here. My mistake.

It's a shame because the opening narrative suggested an interesting film was about to follow:

""...in normal times, evil would be fought by good, but in times like these, it should be fought by another kind of evil""

<Sigh> The premise was interesting at least.

The movie in a nutshell:

Rip Vin Diesel's character out of Fast and Furious, plop him down on an alien planet, add some bad scripting, poor directing, Borg-like bad guys, along with some excellent special effects, and you have The Chronicles Of Riddick.

Rants ahead.

Some foolish moments (in no particular order):

Bad guy with dagger lodged in his back, doesn't notice. Neither do his buddies. But stab him anywhere in the front and he dies. Hmm, note to self...

Riddick can tame wild animals just by staring at them, after which, they like him. ""It's an animal thing"", he says. Huh? Ok.

He can accurately measure distances, while lying down on a transport sled traveling at high speed, with some mercenary sitting on his chest. ""29.4 kilometers"", he says when they stop. Wow, where do I get one of these for my car?

Bad guy jumps at him from a blind spot, our hero grabs him by the throat...all without looking. He's just too cool.

I could go on.

The movie apparently has appeal to some people, so go rent it. If you like it, buy it.

In the end, great special effects cannot compensate for one-dimensional throwaway characters with corny lines and acting that just doesn't make you care for any of them.",1101168000,3,1866,4.538922155688622
2125336,4,B0002VEUTY,"This is a series that has continually impressed me.  I was very fond of the film Pitch Black due to the intense sci-fi fun and very interesting story.  I was pensively waiting to have a sub-par sequel and a low-grade version of Pitch Black.  I was wrong.  Director David Twohy proves that he has mastered this genre and created worlds that will appeal and entice even the novice sci-fi fanatic.  His worlds are vast and his characters are unique and genuine.  Twohy doesn't falter and doesn't hold back.  His graphics are intricate and only helps paint a stronger cinematic picture.  Don't get me wrong, The Chronicles of Riddick is an action film to the highest degree, but those stepping in because of their passion towards Pitch Black will be surprised.  This was a genuine film.  It reminded me of the Alien films and how they continually raised the science fiction bar.  There was something about Ridley that kept me drawn to those films, similar to Diesel's performance as Riddick.

Twohy isn't the only one working hard to build the story and characters in this film, but the cast also lends a huge supporting hand.  Riddled with screen veterans like Judi Dench (whom I think is spectacular for the sci-fi genre), and a cast of C-grade stars, Riddick never once feels cheap.  Everyone, even those who do not have huge amounts of screen time, holds up their end of the bargain.  I especially enjoyed Karl Urban and Colm Feore in their roles as the leaders of the Necromonger people.  They are wickedly evil and only help build their destructive passion.  Finally, I thought this was the role that Vin Diesel was born to play.  With fewer words and more fighting, Diesel proves that he can manage an exciting action film.  So many times we witness the same story, followed by the same stunts, coupled with the exact same language in nearly every action film.  This is not the case with Riddick.  I was captivated with Diesel's portrayal of Riddick.  I say this with as much excitement as I can because I am not a Diesel fan at all.  xXx was one of the worst films ever, and to see him cry just proved that he had sold his soul for Hollywood.  I thought that Diesel portrayed Riddick as this tough guy who embraces evil, but sometimes finds that he grows tired of the day to day drudgeries of being evil.  That is why he decides to fight another evil force, and save the lives of others.  There was a definite character study involved with Riddick, and Diesel did it to the best of his abilities.  He is not a great actor, but neither was AH-NLD, but The Terminator films are still great.

With Twohy's impressive eye and Diesel's simplistic, yet enjoyable, role, The Chronicles of Riddick slowly transform into one of those memorable sci-fi films that you cannot wait to watch again and again.  The imagination just poured out of it like a leaky pool.  I wanted to gobble everything up and fully immerse myself in this world.  The CGI was spectacular, the story was not bulletproof, but it did provide a couple hours of entertainment.  This is not my favorite sort of film, but for some odd reason Riddick caught my eye and wouldn't let go.  Perhaps it was the quick shots during the fight sequences, or the consumable questions about the truth behind this anti-hero, or perhaps it was the spiritual nature of the Necromongers.  Maybe it was all of these put together, but for me it worked.

Overall, I was very impressed.  I guess I could say more impressed than what I originally thought I would be with this film.  I was half-expecting a very debunked Hollywood sequel, but instead what I found was a piece of imagination that was funded by a passion for the characters like no other.  This is a great sci-fi film for anyone that seeks just a bit more action.  It was eye candy, and I needed sugar bad!!  I suggest this film to anyone that loved Pitch Black, but needed more.  It was impressive to the final scene.

This is probably the only time I have seen a director's cut that actually wrecks the movie instead of improving it. I loved this movie in the theatre and was excited about getting 15 minutes of extra footage in this unrated version. All you get are the things the studio rightfully chopped. A lot of ill-placed plot spoilers and unecessary scenes that really detract from the overall experience.

2125340,4,B0002VEUTY,"Chronicles of Riddick is great for a summer movie, fantastic special effects and computer graphics that are seamless. Those ""dog creatures"" were very well done!  MY only complaints are based upon how little the entire premise background of the movie (or the Riddick universe) is explained to the audience. Just who are these ""Necromongers"" and how did they rise to power? How is it that Lord Marshall has those slick agility powers? How is it that he is able to take a person's inner SOUL from their bodies? Too much is just unexplained and it left me kind of at a loss for background details.

It also just barely hints (on screen) that it is the sequel to ""Pitch Black"". If someone wasn't really really paying attention to that brief ""mind probe"" sequence with Riddick and that Elemental lady showing those alien creatures from the first film,

an average viewer might miss that little tidbit, not that it matters for enjoyment of the movie.

Chronicles of Riddick IS very enjoyable. It has breathtaking action sequences and an incredible screenplay.

My only other unanswered question is about the unrated dvd.

According to the director, he digitally re-entered 15 minutes of restored footage to the film, yet I saw none of these ""picture shifts"" that he referred to. In fact, the deleted scenes in the bonus material were NOT included in the main running of the movie (if this material was the restored footage, I don't know).

2125342,4,B0002VEUTY,"The Chronicles of Riddick is an excellent science fiction story that transverses the universe.  Simple story line is good vs evil.  Didn't get a great rating from the critics, but you shouldn't let that stop you from enjoying the movie.  I can promise you, you won't be bored.

In case you slept through the release of Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick is the continuing story of Riddick (Vin Diesel), the bald-headed, night seeing convict who escaped from prison, and is now being sought by bounty hunters and evil doers alike.  These ""Cool"" eyes, which were bought in prison that help him see in the dark, seem as though they can see right through to your soul.

This time out instead of battling aliens, Riddick and crew battle the evil Necromongers, a race determined to convert the entire universe and beyond to the ""UnderVerse"" religion - sort of a death worship.  But these guys are not just bad, they are down right evil, thereby setting up the whole ""good vs evil"" showdown at the end.  You might be tempted to compare the Necromongers to the evil Borg from Star Trek fame, but don't let these guys fool you.  This is not simply a story about a race determined to take over and rule the galaxies, but one that is prophezied for 30yrs, placing Riddick in the role of ""savior"" of the human race and who is predicted to kill the ruler of the Necromongers, Lord Marshall, by his own knife.

This movie ties in MacBeth whereby you have the plot to kill the ""king"".  But the reward here is ""keep what you kill"", and whoever kills Lord Marshall shall rule the entire legion of Necromongers.  The characters placed here are Vaak and his scheaming wife, whose plot to take over and rule place them right in the middle of Riddick's phophecy.

Unlike Pitch Black, this movie delves into Riddick's life more and his past is somewhat revealed.  You learn that he is a the ""last of his kind"", a race known as the ""Furions"", who were wiped by the Necromongers.  You also see a tie in from the first movie whereby old characters are re-introduced in new settings.  Imam, the holy man, and Jack, the little girl disguised as a boy, are seen here.  Jack, of course, is no longer a little girl, nor is she innocent or defenseless.  So seen here more than in Pitch Black is a discovery of relationships and how they affect Riddick's decisions and alter his path from refusing to have anything to do with his prophecy, to fulfilling it.

Edge of your seat suspense.  A must see.",1100995200,,2471,4.534988713318285
2125343,4,B0002VEUTY,"While I fall short of championing ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", I didn't find it as bad as most critics did when it was released. The theatrical release, most likely at studio insistence, was handed a PG-13 rating. The DVD version is the director's cut, which runs 15 minutes longer and would undoubtedly have gave been given an R rating. [It's unrated.] Perhaps this more violent version is also more cohesive.

I don't condone violence. I'm of those wimps who believes in some sort of gun control and who was against the invasion of Iraq. But I know ours is a society that has always condoned - and, in many ways - lionized violence.

The movies have always reflected our values. Gangsters - and, later, the Mafioso - were enshrined as cultural icons. Westerns gleefully depicted the near genocide of Native Americans. Cartoon shorts, which I love, are quite violent. [Bugs vs. Elmer, The Road Runner vs. The Coyote, Daffy Duck vs. anyone who crosses his path, etc.]

This movie is violent, but the killing is more in synch with today's video games than it is with the real world. [Again, Hollywood's reflecting today's culture.]

The story is nonsensical, but is no dumber than the plots of either of the two modern ""Mummy"" movies or of ""Starship Troopers"". If anything, the movie is far more sumptuous visually than any of those movies. The screenwriters may have been asleep at the wheel, but the digital special effect people were not.

The main reason for the failure of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", both with critics and with the public, may be the Hollywood publicity machine. The machine is now totally corporate. Said machine has been intent on making Vin Diesel an action star a la Arnold Schwazenegger or Stallone. What the machine does not understand is that, while Diesel may be a true action star, he is being propelled by a machine, rather than by a series of wise career choices.",1100995200,,1896,4.7682926829268295

Buoyed by the unexpected success of PITCH BLACK, we get Vin Diesel back in a special effects laden mishmash of scifi plotting, wooden characters and repetitious battles.  We even get Oscar winner Judi Dench as Aereon, some kind of ""elemental"" guru who pops in and out to offer her whimsical comments on what Riddick is all about.

Hats off to a superb special effects crew who create fantastically realized other worlds, state of the art spaceships and also to the editors who managed to keep things brisk and flawless.  Alas, special effects do not a movie make.  This unrated director's cut is too long, and only a tru scifi afficionado could watch it with total interest.

Twohy has introduced a remarkable universe and an intriguingly simple, yet complex character in Riddick. This is a character that you can see Vin Diesel really put his heart into. I cannot wait to see how this character evolves, as well as seeing more of this universe, not to mention the infamous Underverse, as well as more on the Furyans. I've heard that Universal will base their decision to continue with a sequel depending on the sales of the unrated director's cut.

2125348,2,B0002VEUTY,"What happens when you mate Dune with the Mad Max films? You get Chronicles of Riddick. Riddick picks up five years of Pitch Black with Riddick being hunted by mercenaries. They fail but he finds out where his bounty comes from and so he goes there and ends up on Planet Egypt. There he meets Imam, still played by Keith David of Gargoyles fame. Then there's some quasi-mystical stuff with elementals who seem to be Mentats from Dune with some magical powers thrown in. Riddick finds out that the Necromongers, another quasi-mystical bunch are out to convert or destroy everyone in the universe. Their leader the Lord Marshal and apparently a worshipper of Transformers' Quintessons can only be killed by a Furian and conveniently Riddick is the last Furian. Then Riddick decides that he's gotta go rescue Jack from Pitch Black so he goes over to the prison planet and finds her played now by the delicious Alexa Davalos. As for what happens after that, I can't say for fear of spoiling Amazon's review guidelines.

The Good: The special effects are quite nice.

The Bad: Ok let's take it from the top. The dialogue is atrocious. I was able to say the dialogue from the movie before the characters said it themselves. Riddick is especially dire, spouting such predictable lines as ""There's only going to be one speed here. Mine."" Riddick acts like a man whose read the script and knows that he's going to survive no matter what. This sort of invincidble character is just bad for creating any kind of drama.

Riddick is the last Furian and once the Lord Marshal discovers his existence he pulls out all the stops to kill him. The Lord Marshal is also the man who waged war on the Furian homeworld to destroy them all 30 years ago. However, we find out that one of the Necromongers is a Furian who converted. For the necromongers, where promotion is apparently gained by killing someone, wouldn't that make the Furian who is also a necromongers more dangerous to the Lord Marshal? I think that some things fell through the cracks during the script rewrites.

Riddick's character has been shredded beyond all worth. Pitch Black was horrid plotwise but at least had an interesting character study with Riddick. Unfortunately he really is the guy with the heart of gold that I was dreading that he'd become in this film. In the first film, I am convinced that Riddick went back for the other two people because he likes challenges. He's one of these guys that gets off on living on the edge. The fact that he had a thing for the pilot also enters into it I think. He also liked Jack because her imitation of him stroked his ego. He never had any respect for Imam though. This movie makes it out like Imam is like his one friend in the world and while I guess they could have bonded after the movie that just doesn't seem right to me. He also rescues a bunch of the prisoners from the prison that Jack is in, even coming back for them when they're in danger. Nothing seems right about that to me.

Whoever wrote this movie has the dumbest grasp of Physics that I've ever seen. First off, it lacks all credulity that a planet where the surface temperature varies from 700 degrees to -300 degrees (we're never told if this is Fahrenheit or Celsius) is going to have a breathable atmosphere. But even giving them that, we have them all cowering in ths shade on this planet while everyone is getting melted whose in the direct lines of the sun and we act like as long as you're in shade, you're ok. Um, if ten feet from you the air is 700 degrees then you're going to get fried. Sure it might be only 650 in the shade but you're still going to die. I swear that Riddick stands about ten feet from a guy that melts, but because Riddick is standing in the shade he remains ok.

No one in the world is ever going to believe that this is the same Jack as the Jack from Pitch Black. Sorry but even given five years that sort of transformation isn't going to happen.

The quasi-mysticism just doesn't work. The elementals just seem placed in here to make a cool effect, not for any plot reasons. The Necromongers keep echoing the idea that they ""keep what they kill"" but what this means exactly is never explained. Apparently it means that you get the title and position (and perhaps possesions) of those that you kill. Yet, even that seems strange. The Necromongers seek the ""Underverse"" which is most likely their name for the Underworld but because its sci-fi we'll call it the Underverse to make it sound sci-fi. However, instead of it being another universe as the name would seem to denote they say that it's ""dark star systems"" which also doesn't make sense. Black suns? The Lord Marshal is the only man whose been there and come back and it's given him super powers because he's both dead and alive at the same time. Of course, this is never really explained either as to how any of his physical abilities come from being dead and alive at the same time.

The plot just flows in magical ways. Riddick apparently set up his escape by being recaptured by the Mercs, but how could he have known that he'd need to go rescue Kyra from prison when this all started. Also, when Riddick first escapes from the psychics that identify him as Furian, how did he get out of the spaceship so effortlessly? I think that A LOT of things fell through the cracks during the scrip rewrites.

The fight direction has the same problem that I've had with a lot of films lately. Basically there are a lot of closeups during the fights and lots of cuts. That makes them disorienting and gives you a hard time telling what's going on. It of course gives the director the benefit of not needing to have their actors actually choreograph anything or learn any fighting techniques, but it seems shoddy. The other problem is the director's penchant for speeding up the camera for a couple of seconds. Doing this normally is ok although weird, but during fight scenes it just adds to the mess.

The Ugly: Everything except Kyra. The cast mostly looks like rejects from the Mad Max films.

The Bottom Line: I liked this movie way more than I thought that I would and I think that it's head and shoulders better than Pitch Black. Sure it abaonded the one good thing about Pitch Black but at least this is a halfway decent adventure film whereas Pitch Black never decided if it was a horror film or an adventure film and sucked as both. I hardly recommend it compared to anything else that I've seen recently and is out on DVD.

I was surprised by the ending because I knew that they wanted to make this a trilogy so I wasn't expecting the plot threads to be wrapped up at the end of this movie. However, the ending does give me hope for the next film. If Riddick is completely devoid of all morality and is just a conqueror then I'll like the next film. Then the third film can be about any sort of redemption or whatever they think that he needs to do. I doubt that they'll do it, but we shall see.",1100822400,,6960,4.471653543307086

But I began to daydream about the story and proceeded to watch it another 3 times in the following days. The more I think about it, the more I can appreciate this movie as a Gem.

Of course it does lack in certain areas (it's a ""VinDiesel flick"" after all), but it's an extremely ambitious story, and I give them a 9 for the effort. They went all-out with the Production Value and the story is an absolute masterpiece. The  Baroque imagery of these crusading death zealots, the realism of the sci-fi, the visuals of New Mecca, and Vin is actually not-bad as the anti-hero. There are so many great things about this movie. My only complaint is that the history behind the Necromongers is too brushed-over in the movie. The Special Features explain alot about their interesting evolution and mission.

Totally worth the price of admission.",1100736000,,969,4.688235294117647
2125351,5,B0002VEUTY,"15 extra minutes doesn't sound like much, but it really improved this film.  I think the theatrical version didn't do as well because it took a character people were familiar with (from Pitch Black) and expanded it to the nth degree without any background explanation!  What makes a ""Furian"" so special? Where the heck did Necromongers come from! These 15 minutes go a long way to fleshing it out (not to mention the deleted scene with Aereon that should've gone in the director's cut). A new character is included in the footage that gives insight to the Furians and the extras provide a deeper mythos for the Riddick world, making you beg for a sequel.

Critics panned Diesel's performance, but really, was Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in the Terminator any better?  No.  Diesel acts as well as any other ""action"" star--see this movie for the action and adrenaline, not an oscar performance. Buy it!

One thing: the movie begins with an introduction by the director explaining that when new/expanded scenes appear there will be some disruption to the scene.  I never noticed anything of the sort.  The movie flowed seemlessly.",1100736000,,1130,4.941798941798941
2125352,5,B0002VEUTY,"An EXTREMELY limited 2 disc version of this DVD was exclusively released by a retail chain. It contains over 50 minutes of bonus features in the form of 4 excellent documentaries not listed on the cover.  The first is RIDDICK RISES, interviews with cast, directer, writer, production team, ect. all about the development of the Riddick character.  Then there is KEEP WHAT YOU KILL, interviews and production shots all about the Necromonger race.  Next is CREATING NEW MECCA, primarily a production featurette with interviews and compelling revelations about the designs and story line.  Lastly, a really interesting feature called the INTERACTIVE PRODUCTION CALENDAR which allows you to highlight given days throughout the production to see behind the scenes clips of what they were working on that very day.  These 4 features provide invaluable insights into the world of Riddick and I can't believe they are left off of the standard version. The package is IDENTICAL to the 1 disc version. Nothing on the outside indicates it has 2 DVDs. The ONLY way you can tell the difference is the UPC sticker on the back of the slip cover. In the upper right hand corner,  the 2 disc version has the numbers 00027 and the standard 1 disc is 00001.

2125353,5,B0002VEUTY,The unrated version definitely added to the theatrical version.  Making the story more fluid and filling in some more of the back story to the furions.  It also changed some of the original scenes making the added scenes fit very well.  Hopefully more directors cuts will be made for future movies allowing the directors show all of what they want to.,1100563200,,351,4.721311475409836
2125354,4,B0002VEUTY,"I didn't expect much from all the bad reviews but I really enjoyed this movie. I liked it even more than Pitch Black surprisingly. Riddick is Vin Diesel's best character period. He's super cool and  deadly and Diesel plays him extremely well. The villains are weak with this silly name. They look like a rip-off of something from Stargate.

  I don't know why Judi Denches performance gets knocked though. She's a lot better than a lot of the other supporting actors. Colm Feore (Storm of the Century) as the head villain is a lot worse. Thandie Newton (Mission Impossible 2), is bad too as this sneaky 2 faced women who is conspiring against him. Alexa Davalos isn't bad though as the Jack character from the first one all grown-up. Her character wanted to be like Riddick in Pitch Black and now her fighting skills a lot like his and she's pretty deadly herself. Anyway this movie is a lot of fun and always entertaining due to Diesel's performance. Script wise though, the Riddick video game even has a better story.",1100563200,,1019,4.644444444444445
2125360,4,B0002VEUTY,"The Chronicls of Riddick takes place many years after Pitch Black and the Chronicls of Riddick Dark Fury.  In that time Riddick has since moved on his own avoiding Mercs and surviving on his own.  However he is eventually found by the Merc introduced in Dark Fury and that brings him to return to Hellion Prime where he dropped off the Preacher and Jack.  While there he is asked to help defend the planet from the oncoming threat known as the Necromongers.  Riddick of course tells them to (censored) and prepares to leave.  However after the Necromongers arrive he must fight for his life.  He is eventually captured by the Mercs he escaped from earlier and is taken to a Prision Planet where he heard Jack has been at.  After a less than Pleasent reunion with Jack Riddick prepares to escape again only to be thwarted by the Necromongers eventually he must return to fight for the sake of the Universe.

The Problem with this movie is not the story, by no means is the story bad in fact it is a great story.  The problem is that the villians are paifully shallow, and the story eventually turns into the proverbial Man who would be King story.  However the Action sequences and the simple yet entertaining story makes this worth watching.

2125362,4,B0002VEUTY,"With ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" director David Twohy takes the same approach as James Cameron did with ""Aliens""--change the focus of the story and don't make a sequel as much as an extension of the first film. While the first film borrowed from ""Alien"" (as much as ""Alien"" borrowed from ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"" or the atmospheric ""Planet of the Vampires"" and other B-movies), ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" builds a mythology for Riddick, Jack and Imam. Riddick is very much an anti-hero in the mold of the Man with No Name. Like that character it appears that Riddick develops a conscience--coming closer to his abandoned humanity through his encounters with Jack, Imam and others.

Five years have passed since ""Pitch Black"". Riddick, still on the run, is being hunted by more Mercs for a big payout. One of the people searching for him is Imam one of the survivors who befriended Riddick in ""Pitch Black"". Imam needs Riddick's help in opposing the Necromongers a race that worships death and destruction. The Lord Marshall (Colm Feore marvelous as always)has plans to conquer the known universe and using those resources to take his followers to the Underverse a mysterious place that changes the essential nature of humanity in a dark way.

Imam knows the legend that only a Furion may defeat the Lord Marshall. He hopes that Riddick will help the people of his adopted world fight back and survive the coming attack. Urged on by one of the Elementals (Judi Dench), Riddick considers their offer and rejects it. He just wants to get on with his life. As in ""Pitch Black"" Riddick gets drawn into the conflict because those that he learns to care about are threatened by the Necromongers. When the Lord Marshall discovers Riddick's identity he tries to have him killed when he won't serve him.

Now Riddick must find Jack (Alexa Davalos)now known as Kyra who has gone to a prison planet in search of him, save her and get revenge for the killing of those he cares about.

A marvelous space opera, Twohy has crafted a suspenseful film that manages to channel the best elements of the Spagetti Westerns, 50's science fiction space operas like ""This Island Earth"", science fiction pulp stories from the 40's and 50's and has merged them into an entertaining larger than life story that provides the epic scope of a ""Lord of the Rings"" within a space opera context. It's a fun movie that has great action, stunts and optical effects. It's not meant to be deep although, like Sergio Leone's westerns, there's more here than meets the eye and dismissing it out of hand is unfair.

The ""Unrated Director's Cut"" is the better of the two versions. it has fifteen minutes of additional footage, character development and background on Riddick's people and what happened to them. While the picture occasionally jumps when segueing from the theatrical cut to the ""Director's Cut"" (due to cuts made to the negative), it's not disruptive enough to disturb the story. Twohy has proven himself an adept director with supernatural thrillers (""Below"")and other science fiction thrillers (""The Arrival"") to his credit. He creates a compelete world for Riddick that was lacking in the suspense thriller ""Pitch Black"". It's a much bigger film with a much different type of story but, essentially, the same character at its core.

The film sports an outstanding high definition transfer. There's also an audio commentary track full of fascinating tid bits featuring Karl Urban (also from ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" as well as a deadringer for a young David Gilmour of Pink Floyd fame), Alexa Davalos (""Jack"" or ""Kyra"") and director Twohy. It's full of interesting trivia about the genesis of the project through the end of production. There's also quite a bit of discussion on the background of characters, changes to the script prior to production and some of the physical challenges the actors and director faced during production.

The featurettes include ""Toombs Chase Logs"" (he's one of the Mercs aka Mercenary bounty hunters hunting Riddick), a virtual guide that pulls in viewers into Riddick's world from the various perspectives of the characters. ""Riddick Insider Facts on Demand"" provides scene specific trivia about various parts of the film and the characters. ""Riddick's World"" features Vin Diesel on a tour behind-the-scenes along with 360 degree virtual glimpse at the various sets from the film.

A marvelous and underrated space opera adventure, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is quite a different film from ""Pitch Black"" and the anime prequel. The fact that Twohy wasn't willing to just repeat himself and came up with new and challenging material is to his credit. It's also why the film is as solid an action adventure saga as it is. Give ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" a chance and disregard the mainstream critics. You won't be sorry you did.",1100563200,4,4872,4.947432762836185
2125363,1,B0002VEUTY,"I'm not quite sure just what I missed in this film that other reviewers seemed to see.  What I saw was a film that looked really good: superlative effects work, good production values, original creatures (especially the cat/hyena/wolves, which appeared only briefly), and far-out costumes. The problem is, it is hugely overblown, and is just NOT INTERESTING.

Frankly there is little real substance to this movie . The convoluted plot made no sense whatsoever; characters are referred to when the viewer has no idea what is being talked about.  Every scene is some kind of grandiose statement, sort of like 'The Ten Commandments' in space.  There are lots of giant ships flying around, gargantuan statues, huge doors, and earth-shattering explosions.  Hordes of armorclad soldiers are on the march, a kind of 'Lord of the Rings/Star Wars' hybrid, but not as good as either (Hey-it's even got a real serious-looking Karl Urban!).  Something about this movie reminded me of that all time classic, 'Battlefield Earth'.

The writing (David Twohy, director/writer) really takes the cake.  There is one scene in particular that really sums up the whole mess: The ultraserious 'Necromongers' (whom my wife was making jokes about during the whole movie), make a long diatribe to the planet's residents about 'conversion' or something to that effect.  The residents look at each other like 'what is this idiot talking about?'  Vin Diesel seems to take himself so seriously that it is geniunely comical, as if his character is a self-parody.  It seems the prequel ""Pitch Black"" (which was a far better film) motivated the film moguls to give Twohy unlimited power to go overboard with this one.

Sorry folks; there is no way in the world this Hindenburg of a film deserves an average of 4 stars.  'Riddick' is a conglomeration of filmwork previously done better by others.  Unfortunately, too much power can be a bad thing for a filmmaker; Twohy did fine work with 'The Arrival' and 'Pitch Black', but this one doesn't even come close to matching them.",1100563200,3,2042,5.002958579881657

Sure, the movie has very little to do with Pitch Black, other than sharing a few characters.  Sure, the movie has some goofy names (Necromongers just doesn't have the sinister ring of Sith Lords, for example).  Sure, the movie does try to throw a lot of background info at you, about this new advanced universe.

But, it all comes together nicely!  The story has enough uniqueness to stand out from other sci-fi works.

Too bad the movie sales weren't higher.  I think this movie was originally planned as the first of a trilogy, but that seems unlikely now.

If you are a sci-fi fan, don't miss this one.",1100563200,3,740,4.455223880597015

I thought another film with Riddick might be fun, but it wasn't a lot of fun.  This is an overlong, overexposed, and over narrative sci fi yarn that looked good, but was empty inside.  The film made little sense, and took itself far too seriously.  Judi Densch must have lost a bet to stay in this dribble that is only saved by some well staged fight scenes and some brisk direction in spots to move it along.  The acting is wooden, and the screenplay introduces a lot of new characters, but fails to develop them, nor make them likable enough that we care what happens to them.

It full of large and minor changes including dialogue and scene replacements. Overall, this Director's Cut adds at least 15+ minutes of extra footage. I feel this version works best compared to the thin plot the theatrical version has to offer. The show is somehow darker now and Riddick seems cooler and more mysterious like he did in the first movie. I was also happy they reinstated scenes showing Riddick's 'special power' and some unrated action.

To you I say: ""You are entitled to your opinion.""

This is a fun movie for anyone who's ever wanted a modern space opera, even if certain parts of the film certainly do not stand on their own very well. A scene here, a scene there... they seem strange, isolated, or out of place in the large context of the movie at times. I promise, though, that this film really is more than the sum of it's parts.

I understand the uneasy feeling the slightly disjointed nature of the movie's beginning can cause, and I can see why it might turn some people away, but for me the movie really began to come together after the first 45 minutes. I really, at that point, began to feel the level that the director was attempting to work on: this is a universe of adventure, where confidence and strength can give you power, where fear and uncertainty make you weak, and where the laws of physics take second rank behind the laws of dramatic movement.

Make no mistake, it's not Shakespeare and some people just can't get into the right frame of mind to enjoy this film... but if you do get there, you certainly will not be dissapointed.

The characters here fight on frigid planets, hunt soldiers in a bombed-out desert civilization's capital, do battle in draconian prisons, and defy empires... all with style and raw power, depending on what the situation demands.

An entire universe, opened like the doorway into a too-bright afternoon, is revealed and hinted at in the movie... this movie is NOT Pitch Black, but if you look at it from the right angle you can see Pitch Black's setting as the agrophobic cousin of this universe.

Conan in a space opera (paying homage in a way that The Scorpion King didn't quite manage, but with many of the same shared elements; born of a savage people, deadly in battle, one man in a huge world, destined for greatness...) is as good a way as any to describe it, whether you mean the old Conan movie or the original tales.

2125388,4,B0002VEUTY,"Mixing elements from David Lynch's Dune, David Fincher's Alien 3, The Fugitive, Gladiator and The Man With No Name Westerns, Chronicles of Riddick is definitely worth watching just for the bad-azz title anti-hero and lavish production design .

It's basically about a wanted Furian convict who's destined to topple a feared galactic empire. Vicious and remorseless, Vin Diesel's character is definitely  not in Luke Skywalker's Friendster page. Along the way, he visits a prison planet and hooks up with the survivors of Pitch Black.  It's stuff of every fanboy's fantasy, but Riddick's detours make the story a little bit scattered. It's not as tight and efficient as his first appearance in Pitch Black. But it's still fast-paced and thrilling.

As expected, Riddick, just like Van Helsing, was lambasted by critics when it was shown in theaters. Maybe one must have had a steady diet of comics and sci-fi books growing up to fully appreciate the said movies. So if you're looking for heady sci-fi fare in the vein of  Gattaca, 2001: Space Odyssey, Twelve Monkeys, stay away.

While Vin made Pitch Black a passable movie (cause the character is so damn kewl), Riddick wasn't enough to carry this movie. The idea was great of an expanded universe and different worlds (ala Star Wars), but it seemed the director just didn't know what he was doing half way through the movie. After 45 minutes into the movie, you start to ask yourself ""where is this movie going"", it just seems to lag and drag on. It had no real direction and the story was poorly told. As I said before, the movie had promise, but it was poorly executed in every aspect, plot, character developement, everything. In all honesty, this is a movie you wait to come on HBO, Sci-fi Channel, Spike TV, TNT, or TBS... not even worth renting because that leads to spending money and this movie really is just a waste of money.

2125392,4,B0002VEUTY,"The Chronicles of Riddick shows b-movies at their best.  Anyone who rates this movie badly just doesn't like b-movies.  Don't hate them, just nod and understand sometimes we don't need plots like A Beautiful Mind when we want to watch Vin Diesel kill things.

In all fairness, it could have been a ""good"" movie.  The plot could have been fleshed out, and it really could have been the start to, say, a trilogy.  But as it is, it is awesome entertainment with ridiculous scenes that look so cool and have so much suspense that the fact they are ridiculous doesn't matter.

The one flaw is the Riddick himself.  The character is great, but he isn't the same guy from Pitch Black.  Once you distance the Pitch Black Riddick from the Chronicles Riddick (Human vs. Furian? Yeah, right), the character fits right in.

By the way, for you haters, you really shouldn't rate movies in genre's you don't like.  If you hated Friday the 13th, Halloween, Scream, then you just don't like slasher flicks.  Same thing here.  If you don't like Starship Troopers, Battlefield: Earth, and Chronicles of Riddick, you don't like b-movies.  Just don't rate them.",1098662400,4,1141,4.760204081632653

This was my favorite movie of the summer, barely edging out Spiderman 2.  I highly recommend this movie for those action lovers out there.  It was extremely entertaining, and I can't wait to buy it!

The concept is great, but there are so many plot holes and the characters are so uninteresting that I could have cared less. It seems to be a wasted effort, though I appreciate the ambitious storyline. The whole thing seems to come off as mediocre at best. I thought it could have been done much better and they COULD have achieved the original grand sci-fi film that they were hoping to make, which would be nice  considering how many movies these days are rehashed from comics and books. Perhaps the DVD release will make up for what the theatrical release lacked. Better luck next time guys.",1098316800,3,750,4.597014925373134

Nice special effects and frequent action scenes make this movie very enjoyable to watch.  Sure, there was some REALLY REALLY corny dialouge (""It's an animal thing!"") at parts, but I still loved this movie, along with the first Pitch Black.

2125396,3,B0002VEUTY,"Judged by almost any standards, ""Pitch Black"" was great: a smart, inventive and glorious unpredictable B-movie that plundered all the good riffs from the Alien franchise and made them its own. It was also - lest we forget - the movie that brought Vin Diesel to the attention of the world. His gruff, laconic turn as the amoral psychopath Riddick was the stuff that popcorn was made for - which, perhaps, explains the chilling inevitability of this sequel.

First things first: this is nothing whatsoever like its predecessor. Where ""Pitch Black"" was all sass and low-budget charm, ""Chronicles of Riddick"" is a bloated, po-faced sci-fi epic - a bit Star Trek, a bit Star Wars, a bit Troy. It'll be hard to watch the first movie again, knowing that writer/director David Twohy had this one in mind all along.

Still, there's fun to be had here - albeit in a faintly naff, ""Terminator 3"" kind of way. Anyone who claims this is the worst film of 2004 obviously hasn't seen ""Aliens vs Predator"" - ""...Riddick"" may lack brains, humour or decent SFX, but it's certainly never dull. The action scenes have plenty of fizz and sparkle, British thesps Judi Dench and Linus Roache are both hilariously wasted in their bit parts, and then there's... Vin. Quite how this man (briefly) charmed the pants off Hollywood is beyond me: put simply, he is the new Arnie. One-riff charisma and delivery, impeccable torso, flatlining sex appeal. Don't get me wrong: he's great. Here's looking forward to an illustrious string of ""Vin movies"", wherein our hero gets to flex his pecs, waste an army or two of baddies, never quite get the girl, and deliver a few naff one-liners like he's suffering a particularly strong bout of constipation.",1096761600,3,1716,4.813559322033898
2125397,4,B0002VEUTY,"this movie was huge. what i mean by that is that they took the approach to jam pack as much as they can into as little space on film as they could. this movie jumped around alot. loose ends were left all over which i can only hope that they will tie up in the sequels.

i loved the fact they used an antihero to get the job done. the last movie i seen with as good of an antihero was payback with mel gibson. riddick was obviously the center of attention in this movie which made it a little difficult to describe where some of these other characters came from. it would have been nice to know a little about the elemental race or even the necromongers origins. they are not even properly introduced except for as an invading army who destroys the planets they land on, which is what the producers were going for.

i liked the scenery they had on planet crematoria, but this was insanely over the top acting. it was as if there were only a few guards on the entire planet so that the criminal population outnumbered the guard population immensly.

the new mecca scene of the necromongers coming was extremely confusing, just as it is supposed to be. a insanely huge army swept through the streets killing almost anything in their path. this is where they focused in on the preacher where the story could have just avoided this confrontation. well at least one of the loose ends was tied up in this movie.

the coincidences were the only real problems i had. it just seems that if it weren't for these little things happening here and there, there would be no way riddick did what he did. i am not going to spoil it, but you will see what i mean when you see it.

overall, good movie, over the top acting, great action sequences, and interesting characters who just leave it wide open for a better description in the upcoming sequels.",1095033600,2,1833,4.379411764705883

Mr. Diesel is the new muscle man on the spot nowday (some people say that he's the heir of Sylvester Stallone).

This movie has all the time a frantic but far fetched timing, with lights exploding everywhere and you will think that this is not a movie but just a nonsense teenager party. This is the main problem with 'Chronicles of Riddick': the movie tell us an absolute confused, dull and unconvinced story, all the time narrated upon a bad narrative. After twenty minutes of the beginning of the movie, any viewer with a minimum good taste will find that this is just another awful and sensacionalist production of stupid sci-fi, following the path of others misfires (as 'Battlefield Earth, for example).

Another problem (and a great one, to be sure) is Mr. Vin Diesel with an another zombie-like performance. In fact, Mr. Vin Diesel is playing one more time his best characther up to date: Mr. Vin Diesel. Even the presence of some good actor, like Colm Feore (a convincent villain) and honorable Miss Judy Dench, can save the day.

He does have an intimidating pressence that makes the bad guys miss, or perhaps they are all just bad shots.

2125401,4,B0002VEUTY,"I was really looking forward to THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK. PITCH BLACK was one of the most innovative sci-fi movies to arrive in theatres in a long time and it is, after all, the movie that really ""made"" Van Diesel. However, I was somewhat disappointed by the film. The movie tried to fit in all the surviving characters from PITCH BLACK and place them in a life and death situation with an invading species that is threatening the known universe, assimilating and annihilating entire worlds at the same time on their quest to find the Underverse. Riddick isn't quite the same person he was five years ago when he blasted off from that planet of darkness. He's got compassion in his soul now. Nevertheless, he's still as smart, speedy, and strong as ever. With a kick-but character like Riddick and a fairly decent story line, you would think the movie would be top notch.

But, it's not. Instead of building on the originality and creativity of the first movie, THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK tries for something safer and rips off some of the best stories in epic sci-fi (the Necromongers are a rip off of STAR TREK's Borg and much of the second half of the movie is suspiciously similar to DUNE). Not only that, but though the movie CAN stand on it's own as a movie, I don't think there are many people out there who will enjoy the movie if they haven't seen PITCH BLACK and know who Riddick is, which kind of defeats the purpose.

Still, the film was interesting enough to keep my attention and even though it's largely a set-up for a third film in the series, there's enough there to make me watch it again and want to see the next movie to see how things play out. There aren't many movie sequels that can do that.",1093910400,,1715,4.476038338658147
2125402,5,B0002VEUTY,"In recent years, sci-fi has taken a very serious hit. With such outings as ""Solaris"" being sent out to compete against such stellar works as the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it's no wonder we've seen such a dramatic reversal. Now, the fantasy movies are the top-notch and the sci-fi movies are crap.

I've been a sci-fi fan all of my life, and I have to admit that as much as I love LotR and HP...I kept a wary eye on my sci-fi movies, waiting for them to return.

This summer, it's really happened. We had ""I, Robot"" and ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" and I hope the trend continues.

I am both an avid writer and reader, and like many of them, I can tell you that a movie doesn't need to dramatically alter my life. Give me a rip-roaring good time, make me laugh and I'm happy.

Riddick does that. The director was very aware of ""cool shots,"" and frequently throughout the film, Vin Diesel's title character stands or fights in such a manner as to look really cool. And that's fine because...it looks really cool. :)

Corny though they may be, I've always enjoyed one-liners. I will admit, I giggled like a small child when Riddick said, ""I hope you don't mind the darkness...the light hurts my eyes,"" as he snuffed out the candles and launched into his foes. This is COOL to watch. That's fine, that's also very important. Even if you have the greatest story in the world, if it's not interesting to watch/read...well, what good's it going to do you?

Story-wise, though, I very much enjoyed Riddick. It was a good follow-up to Pitch Black, while still being solely independent in and of itself. Admittedly, I also thought that they really could have done more with the stellar talent...but what they did was fine. Being a serial movie installment, I have no doubt we'll see more from Madam Dench and the others in future installments.

The story flowed well, one scene to the next, one step to the next. The ending made me laugh, left me in a state of disbelief, and ensures I'll be back in the theater for Riddick 3 the day it comes out.

In fact all Vin diesel does is trash talk, show his muscles, and adds no demension to the character. I want to know more about Riddick, I want to think more about Riddick, did he have a family before he became what he is, or are they just going to subject us to mindless action and no plot. Hopefully they'll add a third intallment, so I can find out. This film needs better acting and more meaning behind the action. ""Kill Bill"" showed that behind all of that blood thirsty action that there was a love story in the middle of it all.

All the critics are not realizing there is nothing wrong with his character; this is how he was meant to be from Pitch Black. He isn't big on talking, he will kill anyone who gets in his way. From Pitch Black we saw this, but we also saw that he isn't a cold blooded murderer because he won't kill the kid to save himself.

I, however, find Riddick's cheesy one-liners and cool-guy persona to be his main redeeming qualities.  What the critics don't realize is that many fans of this genre would prefer that the main character (the tough guy who beats everyone else up)not be overly conversant.  We do not want riddick to launch into an explaination of his motivations, nor do we even care to know what his motivations are.  All we, as fans of the genre, really need to know is that Riddick is mad (furious?) and he'll beat up whoever he wants whenever he wants.  And that's cool.  We do not need a meaninful plot, we just need the director (David Twohy) to shuttle Riddick around the cosmos, for whatever reason (who cares) and put him somewhere where he can kick some butt, that's it.  And he does.  And Riddick does!  And we are pleased.

Sci-fi is a horribly neglected area of film that rarely gets anything made that isn't loaded with cheese and stupidity. Why do you think everyone keeps watching older films like Blade Runner and THX1138?

I give much credit to The Chronicles of Riddick. It seems that they decided to make the film they wanted and audiences can either love it or wait for Jurassic Park 4.

Much is the case of The Chronicles of Riddick star Vin Diesel.  Sadly for him and unfortunate for you, if this fits your view of him, but this film is grossly underrated.  It is a truly well developed film. (As far as Sci-Fi's go)  If you think back to some of the classic otherworldly Sci-Fi film's such as The Planet of the Apes, Aliens, Blade Runner, the Star Wars saga-all of these films take the audience to their world.  A world full of their own genre, style, socialogy not alike to our own, yet not too far off either. (Granted some better than others)  The film is full of rich characters, planetary races, war-mongers, and ethereal beings.  It is a tapestry of classic fantasy noir.  And out of the films I mentioned above TCOR mimics the mythos that the Star Wars saga holds.  It represents the 'coming of age' or growing into 'destiny' that truly great fantasy films capture.  I personally believe people have become too serious with themselves to allow themselves to immerse in the different worlds a film like this introduces.
Keep in mind that I do believe that the film should have ventured for the 'R' rating and had left some of the more ""intense"" battle sequences, as the MPAA put it, in and pushed the Riddick universe to the limits.  Unfortunately a PG-13 rating somewhat ""hammed-up"" the credibility of TCOR, but I do hope that the Unrated version on the DVD measures up to this potentially fantastic universe paving the way for perhaps the future 2 chapters in the Riddick chronology.",1093132800,4,1678,4.673469387755102

  This is the best movie I have seen this year.

 The Story:

  Five years have passed after the events of Pitch Black and Dark Fury, and a New Religious Empire is conquering every single planet in a crusade to share the knowledge of a another universe.

  Five years running away from mercenaries bring Riddick to New Mecca (mentioned in Pitch Black) to know this empire and seek the only being who mean something for him, trying to avoid the battle with the Lord Marshall, who knows something about the past of riddick.

  About the movie: If you like Riddick, you will love the movie. The special effects are great even when the main part of this is used not to action sequences.

  It has all: great story with some of the best actions sequences I have seen in a science fiction movie (and invasion far better than Starship Troopers and Independence day), and of course many secundary characters who make this an incredible film for those who miss the adult scifi (not so great like B5 but better than Star wars)",1092960000,12,1101,4.50761421319797

It was like Blade meets Star Wars... or something... True, I had a little difficulty with Jack/Kira's sudden development/growth in just 5 years, and the ending was a little... open for me (leaving obvious room for another episode), but pushing that aside (and some little holes of plot) it fully redeemed my faith in Vin Diesel as a capable action star. XXX had lead to his falling from my graces. But Riddick brought him back up to me with a smile.

The scenes are great. They are so surreal and visually interesting that they are just breathtaking to look at. The special effects are top notch (especially the scene with the wolf things and the climactic fight at the end). The visual problem i had was with was the armor some of the main baddies.

2125444,4,B0002VEUTY,"I don't like sci-fi films on the whole, and I try never to watch any. But I think that Chronicles of Riddick (and Pitch Black) outdid itself.
Sure, some of the names are corny, and some of the side characters didn't get as much screen-time as I'd have liked them to have, but on a whole, Chronicles built wonderfully upon what was created in Pitch Black.
Having followed the subtle transformation of Riddick from a pure I'm-just-saving-my-ass kind of guy to someone who had feelings by the end of the first film, I think that I (if not many of us) have been able to identify with him a whole lot.
Chronicles deals not just with effects, names, and action scenes. It is a continuation of a person alienated from ""humanity"" to finding a redemption of sorts, to finding his place in this world, and to find that he is able to care for people other than himseslf. It is, in a sense, a phase all of us go through from teens to adults, but shown in a more direct way, a slightly different way. Sometimes, Riddick is the character we all create and hide under for protection.
Killing off Kyra (Jack) and Imam was rather unfair, I thought. Riddick had gone through so much, and had lost Fry already. It was painful to see the only two people he trusted in the world taken away from him. It's like a preview...a test of sorts of our own strength. What will we do if we had all whom we ever trusted and loved taken away? Will we be able to stand alone? Perhaps, like him, we'll find the strength to. Or we may fall.

Science Fiction afficionados will undoubtedly have fun examining THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK for its hidden layers and (hopefully) for what the next installment in the chronicles might hold.
This film is loosely based on the director's-David Twohy-2000 sleeper hit, PITCH BLACK, which introduced us to the butt-kicking, muscle-bound, dark hero Riddick, a conflicted man with a suspicious past and a ""shine"" in his eye that allows him to see in the dark.
In this new Summer release we get to see more of Riddick and learn about his sketchy past. Apparently he's a Furian (a thought-to-be extinct group of humans with...well...I'm not sure what. But he sure can move fast, fight fast and kill fast. Oh! Maybe THAT'S what a Furian is!). And he's been prompted to join in a fight against a group of world conquerors known as The Necromongers (think Gladiators with high tech armor that looks like something from the film Stargate).
When Riddick is `summoned' to the planet Helion Prime he discovers that the planet is under imminent threat of attack by The Necromongers and, before he can leave, the planet is indeed attacked. Riddick is captured (thanks to a beautiful Necromonger played by Thandie Newton) and brought in front of The Lord Marshall of the Necromongers (played by a pretty sinister Colm Feore) for a kind of reverse mind melding where, to the horror of The Lord Marshall, it is discovered that Riddick is the last of the Furians. Since The Lord Marshall was foretold that he would be killed by a Furian, he orders the immediate death of Riddick. But before this can happen, our reluctant hero makes an amazing escape and flees to (or rather is captured by mercenaries and taken to) the planet Crematoria, a small planetary body where it's 700 degrees in direct sunlight and minus-300 degrees in the dark. Here we encounter Jack, the boy who was a girl in PITCH BLACK, all grown up and trying to be a carbon copy of Riddick.
Meanwhile, back on Helion Prime, an Air Elemental creature that wisps from here to there like a gaseous anomaly (I've always wanted to say that!), played surprisingly well by Dame Judi Dench, is captured by The Necromongers and is being used by The Lord Marshall to discover if Riddick really IS a Furian and where he might be and if he's still alive.
A blurring set of battles and eye-popping CGI pulls the story along as Riddick and a group of runaway prisoners escape from Crematoria and head back to Helion Prime in an attempt to rescue Jack (who was captured during the battle), the ONE person that Riddick cares most about.
Does this sound like a lot of information? It is and, in truth, I haven't even scratched the surface of this film's layers. There are new religions introduced, strange technologies, traitorous activities, and the beginnings of the next film, all encapsulated in this oddly stilted movie.
Complaints: My concerns would have to be directed toward the lack of information about certain aspects in plot. For example: What exactly ARE the Furians? Where did they come from? And the ""Elementals?"" Are there Fire Elementals and Earth Elementals as well as Air Elementals? What type of religion is it that The Necromongers practice? We never see any ceremonies or religious symbolism. The Necromongers strive to find their place in something called `The Underverse', but we are never told what or where this place is and exactly WHY The Necromongers are so steadfast in getting there.
Usually, when you start a series or `chronicles', you set up the aforementioned items, giving some backstory while drawing the viewer in. Maybe Mr. Twohy will do this in his next installment, but to me this seems kind of backward.
Maybe it's just me, though.

2125446,4,B0002VEUTY,"I missed the opening night of TCOR (and a free ticket enclosed in my Father's Day Pitch Black DVD gift) because my wife refused to see it with me. For the next couple of weeks I was  bombarded with  typical reviewer comments of SCI-FI movies... ""A computerized mess"", ""sophmoric action"", etc. When I finally got to see it over the 4th of July holiday I was pleasantly surprised...and totally entertained (at 51 years old). This is not ALIEN, Contact, DTESS, or 2001, but I like Sci-Fi action that totally takes you away from reality. This one definitely fits that bill and was well worth the 2 hours I spent glued to the screen watching it.
Movie-Reviewers please don't take this negatively, but have a SCI-FI aficionado review a Sci-Fi movie first... get his reaction and then go and watch the movie. You can't watch Citizen Kane and then go review this movie. Sci-Fi has been getting a bad knock for a while now. Some of its well deserved, but SCI-FI is a genre unto itself and should be reviewed by SCI-FI specialist. No Oscar nomination for Diesel, but honorable mention as one of this years best Sci-Fi action heroes.",1089158400,4,1122,4.633165829145729
2125447,5,B0002VEUTY,"First off, I wasn't that hot on Pitch Black. It was definitely B Genre, in my book, but a great story so pretty bearable.
And I have been hungry for good, fresh, sci-fi. The Star Wars stuff has become stale, and I have watched Aliens too many times!
So, at the theater I saw the previews for Chronicles of Riddick (COR), and thought ""What the heck. Popcorn flick, lots of laughs, probably an okay way to hide from the heat."" The film critics totally lambasted the film, the only positive review I saw was ""not as bad as it could have been."" I thought, ""Okay, there's no Sci-Fi, maybe the effects alone will make it okay, or at least bearable, and I can always just laugh and make fun of the Tough Bald Guy.""  Man oh man was I wrong.
Let me digress a bit here; what's the deal with film critics? Does anybody here remember what the film critics said about Star Wars (the original movie) when it opened? I remember - I was 16 - they said it was ""Cheap comic book trash."" But that was part of an established history - they totally railed 2001 Space Odyssey, faulting it for a clinical appearance and senseless plot. No kidding, study your film history. These guys just don't understand the Genre of Sci-Fi and Fantasy, they prove it time and time again. And here they do it again.
The opening of the film introduced me to a Riddick I could love - no ""tough bald guy look"" here - a shaggy fugitive on an icy planet, struggling to just stay free. It was a big wow. I was riveted, and found myself cheering him to the end - and oh my God, what a cliff-hanger ending. You see it coming, in the last couple of minutes, but they do it OH SO WELL!
The film had what the Star Wars genre currently does not - a fresh look, a new story, with elements that bring together the old. It has the intrigue of Dune, but even darker - with new effects I have never seen before. The scene where the Lord Marshall walks down from his ship, between the armada, and all the ships kneel before him, was one of the most stunning things I have ever seen on film; it dripped of power and theocracy. This is sci-fi/fantasy at its best.
Maybe it was that my expectations were knocked to so incredibly low - but this film scored very high with me, at many levels. If you are Sci-Fi and Fantasy freak, you MUST see this film. It has added to the genre, and is now forever a part of it - the effects of this will be felt in future Sci-Fi films, that is for certain.

Vin Diesel did an excellent job playing Riddick, the conflicted mercenary/killer. The film has alot of good action scenes and Vin does a good job with them. Unlike alot of people, I liked the way the film ended; of course it is a setup for what will be a very interesting sequel.
Hopefully, the producers of the next Riddick film will use a different writer.",1088985600,2,626,4.805555555555555
2125449,3,B0002VEUTY,"Vin Diesel, playing futuristic fugitive Riddick, grunts and growls his way through ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" in a manner reminiscent of Schwarzenegger in The Terminator.  Don't get your hopes up, ""Riddick"" lacks the impact of seminal cultish Arnie flick.
While method acting isn't Diesel's forte, his beefcaked psychique provides a worthy macho image for this role.  The plot which was poorly developed doesn't really define the flick as it is more a vehicle for computer generated special effects.  Some action sequences move so fast as to appear blurry which didn't enhance my viewing pleasure.
It seems that Riddick is a survivor of a thought to be exterminated race called the Furians.  The supreme power in the universe is a sect called the Necromongers.  Their mission seems to be the conquest of all civilizations in order to seek their nirvana called Underverse(?).  The powerful Lord Marshal leader of the Necros played by Colm Feore has been foretold that he will be destroyed by a Furian.  His mission becomes clear.......... destroy Riddick.
This movie was essentially nothing more than violent eye candy.  The accomplished Dame Judi Dench was a strange sight to see among the cast in a film of this type.  ""Riddick"" fails to live up to the mail biting drama established so wonderfully in the prequel ""Pitch Black"".",1088899200,3,1329,5.059633027522936

I may seem nitpicky, but the ending was unfulfilling and anti-climactic. I left the theatre wanting more. but this is at the very least worth a rental.",1088467200,,495,4.636363636363637
2125451,5,B0002VEUTY,"In 2000, we were introduced to Riddick (Diesel), a criminal who can see in the dark.  With the video success of ""Pitch Black"" and the interest of Vin Diesel, a sequel was inevitable.  ""Chronicles"" finds Riddick five years later, and still on the run from bounty hunters.  When he crosses paths with old friend Inam (David), he learns that he may be the only one who is able to stop the Necromongers, lead by Lord Marshall (Feore).  The Necromongers are gearing up to destroy Inam's planet, and Riddick has landed there just in time.  He soon is on his way to save Jack (Davalos), a friend from the previous movie that may be able to help him out.  Throw in Dame Judi Dench, and you even have a touch of class in this sci-fi action extravaganza.
Vin Diesel could very well have a real franchise on his hands here if ""Chronicles"" is able to make a dent at the box office.  Filled with action and amazing special effects, ""Chronicles"" seems poised to do just that.  The ending also provides a jumping off point to further adventures, so don't be surprised to see more of Riddick in a few years.",1088380800,3,1091,4.447236180904523
2125452,3,B0002VEUTY,"Vin Diesel returns to the big screen in the Chronicles of Riddick playing the title role, and reprising his character from the lesser known, but more polished Pitch Black (2000). Now more of a household name Mr Diesel has a wider audience, and much larger budget, which should have meant more, but fails to deliver on several levels. The set designs and CGI are impressive, and a familiar but somewhat inventive story pits our hero against a band of marauding futuristic Nazi's called Necromongers who travel from World to World and either convert or annihilate it's inhabitants. Some fill work explains the connection between the two movies, and we learn that apart from being a resourceful (and indestructible at times) criminal, our hero is also a ""Furion"", part of a thought exinct race, who are the only ones capable of defeating the villians (according to prophecy). Another subplot explains that the young girl saved in the last movie is now also incarcerated on an offworld penal colony and needs to be saved, and of course Riddick is pursued throughout the movie by bounty hunting mercenaries trying to cash in on the reward on his head. All this handled better would have made for a great movie, but the action bounces around in a muddled fashion, and makes the whole experience protracted and leaves the viewer a little weary. This is NOT a bad movie, by any means and will appeal to fans of this sort of action flick, but throughout it is more than a little inconsistent. The script constantly calls for Diesel to remain ice cool, and have plenty of smart quips, and 007 style remarks throughout the 2 hour running time, whilst trying to purvey a sense of desperation and destruction which doesn't tie up. If you enjoy spectacular Dune style depictions, and lavish special effects, this is the picture for you, just don't take it too seriously, as the director seems to have unfortunately done.",1088380800,,1906,4.814024390243903
2125453,3,B0002VEUTY,"Well worth seeing but certainly nothing to get excited about. Vin Diesel is the good bad guy as usual, a part he was born for.
In case you don't know it, Chronicles of Riddick is ostensibly a sequel to a very good movie called Pitch Black with Vin Diesel playing the part of Riddick. The only connection to Pitch Black that I can see is that Riddick reprises the same character, starring the same actor (Diesel).

The Plot
The movie starts out with a scene on an unknown planet where the apparently unstoppable Necromongers have just brutally conquered in their quest to conquer and absorb or destroy all human habited planets. Their next target in their juggernaut is Hellion Prime.
Flash to our protagonist being chased across an icy world by mercenaries (mercs) in a space ship. Riddick after miraculously gaining control of the ship and after discovering from Toombs (Nick Chinlund), their leader that someone placed a bounty on him, is off to the planet Hellion Prime to find out who and why a bounty was placed on him.
On Hellion Prime, our dark hero meets up with his friend(not that Riddick has friends)Imam (Keith David) and Aereon (Judi Dench) who had put out the bounty for his capture. It seems that Riddick, who is a Furian, may be the only living creature that the malevolent invincible Lord Marshal (Colm Feore), leader of the dreaded Necromongers, fears. Thirty years prior, a seer predicted his demise at the hands of a Furian, whereupon he destroyed the home planet of Furians. Their short meeting however is interrupted by none other than the Necromonger invasion.
After the expectedly short campaign, resulting in the Hellions utter defeat, within in Lord Marshals flagship/fortress, surviving leaders of Hellion are given the option of acceptance of the Necromonger religion (purposely kept ambiguous) and fealty to Lord Marshal or oblivion. Of course Riddick, who is cool like Happy Days, Fonzie to the tenth power, is there and of course he bows to no man, so after a short battle with one of the Necromancer centurions in which Riddick is very impressive in dispatching his adversary, it is discovered that he is a infernal Furian just before he escapes.
From there our convoluted story takes us on a side trip to a penal colony on the Planet Crematorium, a planet with daytime temperatures of 700 degrees and nightime temperatures of three hundred below (sounds like our planet Mercury), to rescue Kyra who used to be Jack (Alexa Davalos), a girl Riddick once took care of. Riddick however, has been followed by the Necromancer warrior Vaako (Karl Urban). From there we go back to Hellion and the inevitable confrontation.
Conclusion:
If you only care about special effects and unlimited action, Riddick is your movie but what made Pitch Black great was not the special effects or the action, which was actually inferior to Riddick, it was the intriguing story and for this Riddick does not stand up.

2125475,4,B0002VEUTY,"Pitch Black, the prequel to Chronicles, was one of those low-key, well-done sf movies that are good because they aren't epics.  There is plenty of attention paid to story and characterization.  When Chronicles was being advertised, it seemed that that the film makers had done it again:  taken a good idea and execution and beefed it up into something that was a bore.  They almost did it, but not quite.
Chronicles is fun, even if they did sacrifice story and characterization to special effects, and borrow ideas from other heroes (esp. the Conan the Barbarian movies and Macbeth).  Vin Diesel, while not a great actor, does have great screen presence.  The villains are very interesting and well drawn.  Judi Dench is always a joy on the screen.  The one big problem is the same that Troy suffered:  battles/fights shot too close and too fast and too unsteadily to actually be seen by the human eye.  One has to wonder if the directors are trying to hide the fact that they can't choreograph these scenes very well, and blur them so no one will know.

2125477,2,B0002VEUTY,"For all its generous budget, extravagant sets, explosive fireworks, almost non-stop action, and the presence of Vin Diesel, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" never works.  SFX can make or break a sci-fi film, but that reality often makes filmmakers think they can ignore story and characterization.  They can't, and ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" shows why.  Devoid of any heart or soul, this movie never pulls you in or connects with you in any way, so that none of the visual pyrotechnics ever mean anything.  The plot is threadbare (though the Necromongers are interesting villains, especially the Lord Marshall) and the direction takes some bad turns so that even the scenes that look like they should work fall flat.  Vin Diesel is by no means a bad actor, but his character is so blatantly self-absorbed, immoral, and--even worse--artificial that he never generates much viewer empathy one way or the other. Moreover, Riddick is one of those ""invincible"" characters who can evidently do whatever he wants when he wants, so there's not much suspense. The climax is fairly well-done and exciting, but it takes too long to get there and ultimately not much is resolved. Certainly there will be a sequel, and in fact this is a sequel (of sorts) to the low-budget and lesser-known sci-fi thriller ""Pitch Black"" in which Diesel's Riddick was introduced.  At least that film had the sense to build its story around characterization and suspense, and while ""Pitch Black's"" Riddick was a formidable killer, he was never the ultra-cool superman of TCOR.  If the filmmakers make the next entry in this series more like that, maybe it'll be worth seeing.  Regrettably, ""Chronicles"" isn't.",1088121600,5,1673,5.058181818181819
2125478,3,B0002VEUTY,"Several years ago, a minor but entertaining science fiction movie called Pitch Black came out.  Essentially a well-made man vs. monster movie, this film was most noted for being a breakthrough movie for Vin Diesel.  In the Chronicles of Riddick, Diesel reprises his first big role with limited effect.
In Chronicles, Riddick must contend with the Necromongers, a superpowerful army that goes from planet to planet forcibly converting people to their cause.  They are in search of some mysterious place called the Underverse, which sounds cool, but never really plays a part in the movie.  The leader of the Necromongers - the Lord Marshal -  has heard a prophecy that he could be killed only by a certain race, which not so coincidentally Riddick is one of the last members of.  Before he can even attempt a killing, however, Riddick is detoured to a prison planet where he must rescue a girl who he met in the first movie.
Unlike Pitch Black, which was relatively simple in story and special effects, Chronicles is much grander in both story and look.  This is not necessarily a good thing, as there is too much going on to fit into a couple hours; instead of making the movie longer (or making additional movies), too much is crammed into a limited time.  In particularly, the prison planet sequence really doesn't need to be as long as it is since it really is a diversion from the main story.
There are other problems.  Although scientific law is often ignored in these sorts of movies, the science in this movie is often implausible:  characters can outrun sunrises and somehow, when it is 700 degrees in the sunlight, you can still survive if you're in the shade.  Internally, there are inconsistencies: for example, the Necromonger brainwashing process is sometimes absolutely effective and other times relatively easy to break out (it depends on what the story demands at any given point).
Diesel does a good enough job in his role as the anti-heroic Riddick.  Judi Dench contributes little in her minor role, but isn't bad.  The remaining characters are also played competently if not spectacularly.  Despite its many problems, this is not an awful movie, and there is enough here to merit a weak three stars.  If you enjoyed Pitch Black, you might like this one as well, but it's best to turn off your brain before going into the theater.",1087948800,2,2348,4.791563275434243

2125480,4,B0002VEUTY,"Just saw this. I read the critics panned the movie. Don't believe it. Go see it for yourself. Vin Diesel plays his part perfectly.

Check it out.",1087603200,3,318,4.8
2125481,4,B0002VEUTY,"The Chronicles of Riddick is the continuing story of Riddick (Vin Diesel), the bald-headed, night seeing convict who escaped from prison and was ultimately so tough that he could beat up aliens with just a knife. Given that the first movie was called Pitch Black, Riddick's peculiar eyes lent him a particular advantage - both against his captors and the aliens that inhabited the planet.
On the surface, one could summarize Pitch Black as an Aliens knockoff. But it was so much more than that. Just as Aliens was more than about soldiers blowing up aliens, Pitch Black was about how people hide behind who they really are and that people don't change - they just reveal their true natures. The movie was also noteworthy for being a science fiction film that portrayed Muslim beliefs in a positive light and as the dominant religion.
Keeping those elements in mind, the Chronicles of Riddick (TCOR) is the logical extension of the first movie, even though it doesn't involve many aliens or all that much darkness. No, TCOR stays true to its characters and appeals to what made the first movie so much fun - Riddick's bad, sure...but the bad guys are even WORSE.
Those bad guys are the Necromongers, a race bent on the total conversion of the universe to the ""Underverse"" - sort of an anti-Mecca. The Necromongers aren't just bad guys; they're an entire style. Statues abound of torture and self-mutilation. The Necromonger ships have faces built into their hulls of the uncaring tyrant known only as Lord Marshal. Everything, from the staves the captains wield to the weapons of mass destruction the Necromongers use to obliterate planets - it all fits. The Necromonger ships even hum along on roiling clouds of black energy.
The troops match the architecture. Their helmets model the pain and suffering they believe in. Undead watchdogs, their faces encased in strange helmets, ""lens"" out the living, seeing through darkness and right through walls. Those who are caught are converted to ""half-dead,"" uncaring soldiers in service to Lord Marshal. The most powerful Necromongers can steal a person's soul right out of their bodies.
In short, the Necromongers are really cool bad guys.
If the Necromongers seem familiar to some, it's because they're modeled after the concept of a negative energy universe that so many Dungeons & Dragons players are familiar with. Vin Diesel is a self-professed gamer and his roots show - heck, Judi Dench plays an ""air elemental."" Nobody uses an air elemental in a sci-fi context these days unless they're a gamer.
Unfortunately, this assumption may lose those who aren't sci-fi fans, gamers, or fantasy fans. Indeed, many of the criticisms of the movie is that it's too confusing. My parents (who admittedly, raised me to be the gaming freak that I am) understood the plot just fine, and they are not gamers.
If the plot were merely about the Necromonger's quest to take over the universe, it would make for a rather feeble rip off of the Borg from Star Trek. Instead, Riddick is prophesized to kill the Lord Marshal, and as a result his second in command (played by Karl Urban, of Eomer fame from Lord of the Rings) along with his scheming wife plot to bring about the conflict.
Why? Because the Necromonger way of life (er, death?) is ""You Keep What You Kill."" In other words, whoever kills the Lord Marshal gets to take over the entire legion of Necromongers.
Of course, Riddick wants nothing to do with his fate as one of the last members of a race known as the ""Furions."" The Furions have been all but wiped out by the Necromongers. But Lord Marshal is to be killed by his own knife by Riddick...so bounty hunters are once again on his trail.
Being on the lam is not a good way to raise a kid. Riddick has long since left the Imam on New Mecca and Jack (the kid from Pitch Black) to her own devices. When the Necromongers finally back Riddick into a corner, he discovers there's no escaping the bad guys...or his past.
TCOR is filled with a lot of important relationships, commentary about the nature of evil, snide swipes at religious institutions, free thought, and morality. It also has plenty of action. Instead of running across a pitch-black planet, Riddick must traverse a burning planet aptly named Crematoria.
With the majesty of the Necromongers and the amount of planet hopping that takes place, digital effects are rife throughout the movie. These are expected - indeed, the movie would be unwatchable without the effects, some of which are integral to the plot. The most subtle effect is Riddick's eyes, that shine like silver plates in the darkness.
Critics of the film have pointed out that Lord Marshal does not appear to be a physical match for Riddick. That's kind of like saying ""The Emperor doesn't seem like he can take Luke Skywalker in a duel."" The physical presence of Lord Marshal is not the point. He is the only one to have touched the Underverse and upon doing so acquired incredible power. He SHOULD look like a ""normal guy.""
The Chronicles of Riddick is a good old-fashioned science fiction ride across the universe in the tradition of Conan (especially the ending). The movie will only seem confusing to people who are not familiar with gaming and fantasy tropes...and thus critics and boring people SHOULD NOT SEE IT.

There are only a few times where previous knowledge of the character would even be helpful, let alone necessary.

Just biding my time till the Farscape mini series airs this October 2004 on the SciFi channel.",1087257600,3,463,4.488095238095238
2125507,4,B0002VEUTY,"Okay what I don't get about this movie is this: 'high minded"" critics give thumbs up to crapola like the day after tomorrow and troy and then trash this? Let me tell you something ""The Chronicles of Riddick is pure cinematic poetry compared to the aforementioned turkeys. Vin Diesel and Karl Urban from the lst two LOTR movies are good enough to smooth over the rough patches in the script (hence no 5 star rating) and the action is top notch. I watched this film pleasantly reminded of the first two Conan movies. I even have to admit that I wasn't expecting the surprise ending and he[[ yeah I hope there will be a sequel.  This has been the best movie so far this summer after Hellboy and the third Harry Potter take it to the bank",1087257600,,734,4.357664233576642
2125508,4,B0002VEUTY,"The Chronicles of Riddick, the ""sequel"" to Pitch Black, is not really your standard summer movie fare, and although I had a blast watching it, I think it is safe to say that it's a little to ambitious for its own good.
Let's start with what works:
The script and direction (both by David Twohy) are excellent all around. Cinematography is fantastic, as is production design (even if it is a little too reminiscent of Dune and Stargate).
Vin Diesel absolutely OWNS the Riddick charcater, Alexa Davalos is effective (and easy on the eyes) as an all-grown-up Jack, now called Kyra. Nick Chinlund as the Merc Toombs is a riot (and reminds me alot of Ron Pearlmans ""Johner"" charcter from Alien Resurrection), and Judi Dench is enjoyable as Aereon even though shes given little screen time.
The effects are impressive, though a little overused in the first few moments of the film.
Everything on the planet prison Crematoria. Thhese are the sections of the film that are most like Pitch Black, as far as putting Riddick back in his element and letting him be a badass.
Like most of Graeme Revells work, the score is very nice, especially the reprise of the main theme from Pitch Black.
What Doesnt Work:
The race of Necromongers. Aparently the necromongers are the only race with weapons, because with the ease that Kyra and Riddick tear through them, it would seem to me that any planet with a decent military would be able to defeat them.
Colm Feore as Lord Marshal is just a weak villain. His reasons and motivations are never made known to us, and beside the oddly animated power to rip the souls from people and move fast, he really doesnt present any threat.
The Furions. What are they, where did they come from, why do they seem to have mystical powers (i.e. riddicks EyeShine). None of this information is told to us, leaving us to speculate until Twohy decides to make the next film in the series.
!!!!SPOILER WARNING!!!!
The systematic killing off of every interesting character except Riddick. First Kieth Davis as Imam, then Toombs (supposed as it is unseen), then Kyra. What was the point in this? Imams death was completely pointless, and as we never see his wife and daughter grieve for him, it leave you with the impression that this didn't affect them.
Toombs' death while unseen, and purely speculative, still kind of irks me, though hopefully he did manage to escape and will return in the next installment.
Which brings us to Kyra, the most likeable character in the film. Her death is the most offensive, and forced death in the film. Though I can understand the significance of it (to show that riddick does care about her). I just cant help but fell that her absence will be all too apparant in subsequent films. She would have been very complimentary to riddick.
!!!!END SPOILER!!!!
Now, maybe this is all part of Diesel and Twohys master plan, maybe this film is supposed to leave us with more questions than answers, but I don't think its likely.
With the quality of the game ""Escape From Butcher Bay"", and the very positive word on the ""Dark Fury"" animated feature, its a shame that all the material meant to promote this film has turned out better than the film itself. Dont get me wrong, I had a blast with Chronicles, and look forward to seeing it again and eventually owning it on DVD, but I think some of its ideas were either not fleshed out enough, or forced in just because they seemed ""cool"". Had this film been extended and cut in half, it really could have worked well. With the introduction of the necros and the stuff on crematoria serving as part one, and almost everything on helion prime serving as film two. This would have given film one some breathing room to really get into some deep character development, and would have given film two the emotional gravitas it needed to be really effective (because as it is, it just seems cheap).
But still, I am looking forward to the continuation of the series.",1087171200,5,3942,4.648997134670487
2125509,5,B0002VEUTY,"Ignore the whimpers, whines, and groans coming out of critics of this film. It combines elements of Dune and star wars to create one of the most entertaining, dark, and tetosterone filled sci-fi movie you have seen in ages.  It has little in common to pitch black save the returning characters of riddick, the holy man, and jack (now called kyra).  This time around the situation is more one of intergalactic warfare wherein a race
called the necromongers are determined to convert every humanoid in the universe into one of their own. obviously, riddick is not enthusiastic about their club, so he shows them how he feels by doing all he can to stop them. riddick's character is further explored as we learn that he is one of the last of a race called furians (a defiant lot).  The fight scenes, battles, special effects, etc, are all top notch in this film. It annoys me that we live in a world where the new star wars franchise can create characters like jar jar binks and still be generally accepted while making a bundle. chronicles of riddick is for all of you who beleiver sci-fi movies shouldnt just be for children.",1087171200,3,1124,4.61
2125510,5,B0002VEUTY,"David Towhy has a knack for knocking off movies, yet putting enough differences in them to still kick ass. Pitch Black, as i origionally thought, was an ALIEN rip-off, yet it was so artistic (The cinematography) and bad ass (riddick) that i LOVED the movie, and is still one of my favorite movies. When i saw Chronicles, i was just as impressed. This movie is a rather clear DUNE rip off, though its not too similar that its stupid (SOUL PLANE), and it adds its own elements
Vin Diesel is in full form as his best character, and still envokes Bad-Ass envy in every guy (much like the Punisher). I loved the Story, albeit a bit complex and corney, it worked well for this universe Towhy has made. The action is Top-Notch, and still artistic. There are several battles that don't have sound affects, just voices, which adds to the meyhem and makes you see how evil and good Riddick really is. And Kyra is hot. The tie-ins with Pitch Black were nice to see. The prison escape is adrenilne pumping and intense. The final battles with Lord Marshal are also very cool, and it adds alot to the characters of Riddick, Kyra, and Lord and Lady Vaako. The MacBeth story within the Dune story works well, and (if you and your bros are watching the movie) are good for feminisim cracks, and cracks on crazy chicks in genneral.
This is a GREAT action movie, and Vin Diesel is kick ass, Kyra (insert Actresses name) is hot, and bad ass as well
The only thing, which is more of a personal thing, is that i wished that the movie wasn't quite so Epic. I enjoy small, meningless stories of a few people that don't affect the universe. This story is ALL about affecting the Universe, as basicly, this whole empire falls into a battle between Riddick, Marshal and Vaako (kinda like Smith and Neo). I prefer the Pitch Black style, where it was just the 7 or 8 people that were in peril, everyone else was fine.
Hopefully, somehow, Towhy could return the sequles (he wants a triliogy of Riddicks) to a smaller scale, but this is probably impossible, based on the end of this movie. It will be interesting to see the Underverse however
All in all, im expecting a great series to rise from this movie, much like the matrix (cause i LIKED both ReLoaded and Revolutions)
SO, Go see it cause it is:
1) Good action movie
2) a story that shows real characters
3) A great dune rip (like star wars)
4) A great Sci-Fi movie
5) Maybe even a date movie, its got enough good aspects that i bet women would like
see it",1087171200,,2481,4.407407407407407
2125511,4,B0002VEUTY,"Riddick is the ultimate science fiction anti-hero. He is the driving force that takes this movie to a whole new level. If you've been looking for something new in your science fiction than this is it. Much like its little brother, Pitch Black, its a typical science fiction plot, a race of intergalactic people run around the universe taking over planets. Riddick has been brought into this mess against his will. In keeping with his character, he is always driven by one thing: looking out for # 1. This is the first chapter to a possible series of films about this really fun, butt kicking character.
The special effects are pretty standard. Although there is an annoying fuzziness to it all that isn't always pleasing to the eyes. The supporting cast is decent enough to back up the awesome screen presence of Vin Diesel who carries this picture from one thrilling scene to the next. His  dead pan expression brings back those 80's one man armies with glistening pecs and cool one liners. It plays out as a very introductory plot leaving much to be explained later. It doesn't over burden itself with a huge epic story all in one film, instead it keeps things small as we watch Riddick on his the adventures that lead him to the necromonger king.
The films end is truly inspired. If you love this character you will have a big grin on your face at the possibilites the next two films may have in store. It does have its flaws though, the action scenes are edited in a very chopper manner, and the absence of sound in one big fight scene is obvious and makes the scene feel empty. This was surely done to secure the PG-13 rating. We can probably expect an uncut directors edition on DVD.
Granted if you don't already love Riddick from Pitch Black alot of this film may be too hard to swallow, but if you lose yourself on this ride you will come out truly satisfied.",1087171200,2,1867,4.507374631268436
2125512,5,B0002VEUTY,"I've been waiting for this movie for well over six months, and I have to tell you, I was not disappointed in the least. In fact I'm going to see it again. This is an Action, Sci-fi Adventure with Vin Diesel, what else could you ask for. A lot of (...) action with an original story and a great sequel to Pitch Black. So don't listen to these idiot reviews and critics who only give this movie one star. ONE STAR, ARE YOU KIDDING ME, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING DRIVING MISS DAISY. You go to the movies to be entertained, I give stars on entertainment value, who cares if it wins an Oscar. GO SEE THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK.",1087171200,,623,4.2

Not only does it flow and have more energy than the last 3 STAR WAR films, but is a fast-paced adventure, chock-full of sci-fi/action and beautiful production scale.
I for one was never bored.  From the energized beginning as Riddick is being pursued by mercs on a frozen planet - to his sojourn to a hell world prison planet.
If you are looking for an epic feeling and different looking sci-fi film - Chronicles of Riddick delivers!
I was expecting just an OK film, but what I got was a film I'd not only see again - but one I can't wait to own on dvd.

2125525,5,B0002VEUTY,"""The Chronicles Of Riddick"" is a great movie! It has excellent special effects and a beautiful production and costume design. This movie is the sequel to ""Pitch Black"" (2000) Vin Diesel (who also produced the film) is back as Richard B. Riddick, the escaped convict and murderer who escaped off the planet safely from the aliens in ""Pitch Black"" (2000). David Twohy, who directed and co-wrote ""Pitch Black"" (2000) is back as well, this time, it is just his name on the screenplay and story. Keith David is back as well, too, as Imam, who escaped off the planet safely from the aliens with Riddick, as well. Alexa Davalos plays a character from the original whose name is different than it was in the original. She plays Jack, whose name is now Kyra, who also escaped off the planet safely from the aliens with Riddick and Imam. The composer, who did the music from ""Pitch Black"", Graeme Revell, is back as well, composing a intriguing score in this movie. This movie is as great as its original ""Pitch Black"". It's fresh and it is a well-designed film. This well-rounded cast also includes Colm Feore as Lord Marshal, Thandie Newton as Dame Vaako, Judi Dench as Aereon, and Karl Urban as Vaako. The cinematography by Hugh Johnson, who did the cinematography to the Ridley Scott films, ""White Squall"" (1996) and ""G.I. Jane"" (1997), is excellent. The casting by Anne McCarthy (who was one of the casting directors for ""Pitch Black"" (2000) & Mary Selway is excellent. The film editing by Tracy Adams, Martin Hunter, & Dennis Virkler is excellent. The production design by Holger Gross and costume design by Michael Dennison & Ellen Mirojnick is excellent and beautiful-looking. As is the art direction by Kevin Ishioka, Mark W. Mansbridge, & Sandi Tanaka & set decoration by Peter Lando. The visual effects by Rhythm & Hues, CIS Hollywood, Industrial Light & Magic, The Farm West, Double Negative, Cobalt F/X, Hammerhead Productions, is beautifully excellent. The stunts are excellent and well done. This movie was well made and well designed, visually. Go see this movie if you want to. Go see it before ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) comes out into theaters Wednesday, June 30, if you want to.",1087084800,,2183,4.839572192513369

2125527,4,B0002VEUTY,"I went to see this movie with relatively low expectations, but ultimately found it to be above average sci-fi fair. Does an effective job of balancing special effects and production values that are superb and a story that is actually pretty promising given the clear ambition to make more than one of these movies and dialogue that is highly stylized and hyperbolic.
Not the most cerebral movie you will see this summer, but... you know... it's summer time people. And this is an involving piece of escapist entertainment, somewhat silly premises are par for the course.",1087084800,,570,4.947916666666667
2125528,3,B0002VEUTY,"David Twohy's The Chronicles of Riddick is an enjoayble sequel.  I never actually realized how much of a highly anticipated movie this was, considering the new Director's Cut of Pitch Black was released and an animated series of films called Dark Fury.  Vin Diesel is back as Richard B. Riddick in this action-packed, special effects extravaganza.  I tried to make some sort of plot but I just couldn't find one.  The story while completely incoherrent is luckily saved with some dazzling
special effects and hot action.  The planet Helion Prime is invaded by the Necromongers led by Lord Marshall (played nicely by Colm Feore).  The Necromongers are a deadly force, destroying all life in their path.  Riddick must stop them.  I must say that this is one of the most entertaining sci-fi flicks
I've seen since the Matrix trilogy.  The rest of the cast includes Thandie Newton, Dame Judi Dench (guess she needed money), Alexa Davolos, Karl Urban and others.  The sets are astonishing and the budget (I'm not sure of what it is) really does show.
  The Chronicles of Riddick has been getting mostly negative reviews but it's a fun movie, one which obviously shouldn't be taken too seroiusly.  I must say I had some doubts when I leared that this film was rated PG-13, considering Pitch Black was ""R"" and had some gore, though the fights were a lot more intense and there were more of them. The film is rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Violent Action and Some Language.  The action in this movie does bring to mind the movie ""The Matrix,"" but the action is still cool and intense.  There are quite a few fight sequences (more action than in the first movie)  with impaling but the fights remain bloodless and nongraphic.  There is some occasional profanity, not too strong as well as mild sexual innuendo.  Overall, a fun enjoyable sci-fi sequel which I
fun in watching, worth seeing in theatres, but if you chose not too, definitely check out at Blockbuster.  See Pitch Black if you haven't yet.",1087084800,2,1998,4.755813953488372
2125529,3,B0002VEUTY,"I enjoyed the movie for what it was, a good action adventure story.  I give it a higher rating than I might normally for such pedestrian fare because the characters were engaging and the special effects superb.  I really enjoyed viewing the dark and twisted images of the Necromonger world. You have to suspend your belief at various parts in the movie such as when  Riddick races with his crew across a triple digit sub zero planet with absolutely no protection against the cold.  Despite this silliness, if you're looking for some light fare with plenty of action, this movie is for you.  As a note of comparison, if you liked Van Helsing, you'll probably enjoy this film.",1087084800,2,674,4.677966101694915
2125530,2,B0002VEUTY,"I learned long ago that life could be very dreary indeed if I didn't cut summer blockbuster movies some slack. Summer is the season of mindless entertainment, so judge the films accordingly. Sure, it's nice to see a summer movie with some depth, but it's also not realistic to expect Shakespeare in the park.
So far, this summer, I've generally bucked the critics. I had fun with ""Van Helsing"" and enjoyed ""The Day After Tomorrow"". I mostly agreed with them on ""Shrek 2"". But now comes ""The Chronicles of Riddick"". I was never that much of a fan of ""Pitch Black"", but ""XXX"" did OK in the mindless entertainment department, so I had some hopes for this.
I was wrong!
First the good news... I was so proud of myself for being one of only a handful of folks in the theater that actually could follow what passed for a plot. The bad news was that even understanding it didn't help.
While the CGI FX are up to current standards, the story is a mess. The writers (I assume it had writers) took the ""let's throw everything against the wall and see what sticks"" approach to storytelling. Worse yet, from my perspective, it attempted to integrate religion with SF. This is a tricky thing to pull off and very few shows do it successfully. (For an example of a show that did a good job of it, buy at least the first four seasons of ""Babylon 5"" on DVD.)
(...)
Worst of all, it committed the same flaw that undoubtedly contributed to bad word of mouth for ""Van Helsing"" - it had a real downer at the end. Given the way movies are made these days, I have to assume that at least two alternate endings were actually shot for test audiences. If the makers of ""Riddick"" were clever, even if they favored the current ending, they would have learned a quick lesson from reviews and exit polls of the ""Van Helsing"" audiences. Had they done so, they would have done some quick surgery to provide a more upbeat ending.
All in all, very disappointing. I rated it a 2 for some good visuals and interesting FX. Otherwise, it would be no higher than a 1. OTOH, they could have skimmed off 10% of the FX budget and put it into a better story and writing and gotten much, much higher.",1087084800,2,2157,4.381546134663342
2125531,4,B0002VEUTY,"First thing's first: If you are interested in this movie there are only a couple of possible reasons. 1. Vin Diesel's star power.  2. The Sci-Fi/Action approach.  3. It's the sequal to ""Pitch Black.""
  Now, if you are honest about any of these, you are going to enjoy this movie. If you are someone looking for something deeper, you just won't get it. It's a Sci-Fi flick, first and foremost, and it does a great job. However, it's history is obviously sketchy. ""Pitch Black"" was a huge sleeper hit, and when I heard a couple of years ago that the producers wanted to focus on that success by developing a series based on its most popular character, Riddick, I was concerned. It felt like, ""Ok, that would kick ass!"" But that anti-hero feel he generated was one of the best parts of the film, and by expanding on his universe, they needed to be careful to maintain that. So did they? NO. They tried to make it LOOK like they did, but the reality is, if you're a fan of ""Pitch Black,"" be prepared to see a different Riddick. He has the same type of one-liners, but they are writing him into the role of a hero, as subtley as they can. The bottom line is they found success with PB, and a popular character with Riddick. ""Chronicles"" was a great idea, executed pretty well. It could have been better.....and once you see it, you'll know what I mean (ok, UNDERVERSE?? I just don't know what to say about that.)
  Personally, I DID enjoy this film. Its few moments of real ""cheese"" and predictability aside, it's a great Sci-Fi/Action movie. Great star, great effects, decent follow up and incorporation of PB ideas and characters. If you read this far, go see it, you'll have a good time.

This movie is not the ""greatest movie ever made"". It won't win an Academy award. But, it was an entertaining movie that held my interest and was about what I expected. The visuals are stunning- a great deal of computer time and effort went into creating the many worlds of this film. Diesel's character, Riddick, was true to the character he created in Pitch Black. Yes, he generally speaks in ""one liners"" as many reviewers have criticized. But- his character is supposed to be a hardened criminal who has spent the majority of his life alone and hunted. When would he have the opportunity to develop social skills?  It would be out of character for Riddick to be exceptionally talkative. Vin Diesel did a nice job in this role. He displays the tightly controlled emotions you would expect from Riddick and does a great job in the action sequences. Go see this movie.
