3948101,4,B002LHGI1K,"This release presents us with a far superior product to the original DVD release. Both movies are in widescreen, and each contains both the English language version and the original Japanese language version with English subtitle option. The movies look great. The only drawbacks are, in my opinion, relatively minor. GvKG doesn't have the Toho logo at the beginning, and neither movie has the full closing credits. The latter is probably due to Sony not taking the time to translate all those credits into English. For those who feel cheated, here's what you don't see: in GvKG, the credits run over three minutes or so of Godzilla waving his arms and occasionaly breathing bubbles fire. In GvM you see the credits roll over an otherwise empty star field. I was a little disappointed that the English language track is in mono, not stereo, but there doesn't seem to be a stereo English track in existence for either film. I can understand Sony's reluctance to create an all-new English language track. These tracks were made back in the 1990's, when stereo sound wasn't as big and important as it is today. Finally, the English subtitles have a few inaccuracies to them, some of which can be ignored, others of which are glaring. They look like they are faithful to the English language dub. It's a pity they couldn't offer a separate subtitle set for a better translation of the Japanese dialogue. But these are comparatively nitpicky things. The overall importance is that we have beautifully rendered widescreen presentations with option of languages, and they have been a long time coming. Enjoy!",1399507200,23,1601,4.933333333333334

3948122,4,B002LHGI1K,"I'm a big Godzilla fan and the Heisei series has always been my favorite, and these films are two of the best of the Heisei era. Quite frankly I would also say Godzilla Vs. King Ghidorah is one of the best of the franchise, and probably No. 2 for me for favorite Godzilla films of all time. A lot of people hate the Heisei series and will say it's filled with too many boring talking scenes, too ridiculous, derivative and too many beam weapons. I find these complaints silly, while the boring talking scenes are indeed boring I feel they add to the buildup and payoff of the monster action- which when Godzilla shows up he shows up to stay unlike in 2014 , saying the Heisei Godzilla films are ridiculous and sometimes derivative is pointless because Godzilla films have always been ridiculous and derivative- that's part of the charm. As far as the over reliance on beam attacks, personally I prefer that for these films because look... most grappling and close combat in giant monster films with suitmation has never looked that good until besides some of the newer Gamera films, GMK and Final Wars. The Kiryu films are a prime example of that for me because while the films look good,but some of the grappling and melee scenes look like the two monsters are dancing, I can just believe the Heisei films a lot more as far as the way they do their fighting scenes- personal opinion.",1469664000,,1384,4.562248995983936

Now on to Godzilla vs King Ghidorah, M-11 ,at the last half of the movie, was hilarious ... The Dorats.... How could something so cute turn into Green-Eyes Golden Dragon.....overall i thought i was okay...Could have been a bit better. I wish their was an epilogue for it though...
Well next month, Godzilla: Resurgence comes out in theaters in Japan.. Hopefully, we get it soon with the ORIGINAL VOICES...

Godzilla 1984 aka Return of Godzilla is coming to dvd and blu ray on September 13... And Soviet Union is actually not the bad guys in it, like the american version made it out to be...

Oh btw, i was absolutelty laughing when i watched the scene where Godzilla (pre-Mutation) was just stomping and knocking trees down on the World War 2 soldiers on the americans side in Godzilla vs King Ghidorah...

3948130,5,B002LHGI1K," VS , (Godzilla vs King Ghidorah) 1991

Directed by Kazuki Omori, Produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka, Shugo Tomiyama, Music by Akira Ifukube and featuring special effects by Koichi Kawakita, the film starred Anna Nakagawa, Megumi Odaka, and Akiji Kobayashi. This is the first time where the final battle will be held in a city unlike the Previous Godzilla films the final battles are always outside of a city and in a more mountain like area but this film and many more after this always feature the final battles in more city settings.

Back Ground info: This film is set after the events of The Return of Godzilla (1984) and Godzilla vs. Biollante (1989). Originally, the film was to be a remake of King Kong vs. Godzilla with the title Godzilla vs. King Kong, but Turner Entertainment demanded too much money for the use of Kong. After this, Toho had the idea of making Godzilla vs. Mechani-Kong (from 1967's King Kong Escapes), but director Kazuki Omori feared that this would ultimately violate Turner's copyright as well. Toho eventually settled for Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, pitting Godzilla against his archenemy from the original series.
Story: Kenichiro Terasawa an author of books on psychic phenomena believes he's discovered Godzilla's true origin. During World War II, a group of Japanese soldiers stationed on Lagos Island in South Pacific were unintentionally saved by a Godzillasaurus, which attacked and killed a group of American soldiers who had landed on the island in February 1944 as part of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. While all of the Japanese soldiers on the nearby Islands fought and died to the last man, the Japanese soldiers on Lagos survived the war and eventually returned to Japan. In 1954, the island was destroyed by a hydrogen bomb test, just months before Godzilla first attacked Tokyo. Yasuaki Shindo, who commanded the Japanese on Lagos, is now a wealthy businessman who denies the dinosaur's existence. Meanwhile, a UFO lands on Mount Fuji. When the army investigates, they are greeted by Wilson, Grenchiko, Emmy Kano and android M-11. The visitors, called the Futurians, explain that they're from the year 2204, a time long after Japan had been completely destroyed by Godzilla. They explain that they can time travel back to 1944 and remove the Godzillasaurus from Lagos, thereby avoiding the creation of Godzilla. As proof of their story, Emmy presents to the Japanese government a copy of Terasawa's book, called the Birth of Godzilla which he hasn't even written yet. Terasawa, psychic Miki Saegusa and Professor Mazaki board a time shuttle and travel back to 1944. As American forces land on the island and engage the Japanese forces commanded by Shindo, the dinosaur attacks the American soldiers. However, subsequent bombardment from American naval vessels leaves it gravely wounded. Shindo and his men, after thanking the Godzillasaurus, withdraw. M-11 teleported the Godzillasaurus from Lagos island to the Bearing Sea. They then return to 1992, but not before releasing three, small artificial creatures called Doratss on Lagos. The radiation as a result of the nuclear test fuses them into King Ghidorah. The Futurians use Ghidorah in the present to subjugate Japan. They issue an ultimatum, but Japan refuses to surrender. Feeling sympathy for the Japanese, Emmy reveals the truth behind the Futurians' mission: In the future, Japan becomes very wealthy and its economy surpasses that of the United States, Russia and China. The Futurians in fact stole the time machine and plan to use King Ghidorah to alter the future by devastating present-day Japan, preventing its future economic reign. Shindo, meanwhile, believes that Godzilla can be re-created by using his secret, nuclear submarine with powerful Nuclear Missiles. Terasawa learns that a Russian nuclear submarine sank in the same region the Godzillasaurus was teleported to, giving off enough radiation to create the same Godzilla who destroyed Tokyo in 1984. After she is returned to her ship by M-11, she reprograms the android. But while on its mission, the submarine is destroyed by Godzilla; Godzilla finally arrives in Japan in an ironic twist of fate, the Futurians had not erased the original Godzilla from history; they had actually created the second and current Godzilla. Wilson sends King Ghidorah, to destroy Godzilla. With M-11, and Terasawa's aid, they sabotage Ghidorah's control in the UFO. Godzilla and King Ghidorah have a long hard battle which eventually ends with Godzilla blasting the middle head of King Ghidorah. However, Emmy's companions reveal that their ship is bound to automatic time warp in the event of sabotage, allowing them to return to a future where Japan has been destroyed either way. Before the final blow, Godzilla turns to his left and destroys the UFO, which was teleported by M-11 before it could time warp, killing Wilson and Grenchiko with his atomic Breath. Godzilla then delivers a final blow to King Ghidorah by using his atomic breath on Ghidorahs left wing sending him into the ocean. The JSDF attack Godzilla in Sapporo, to no avail. He then turns his attention on Tokyo, destroying the metropolis. In the process, Shindo is killed; though not before he and Godzilla share a brief moment, where Godzilla is seemingly sad for once. Emmy, however, travels to the future and returns with Mecha-King Ghidorah, a resurrected cyborg version of the original creature. Battling in the heart of Tokyo, Emmy carries Godzilla off and drops the monster together with Ghidorah into the ocean. She then returns to the future in the time shuttle, but not before informing Terasawa that she is in fact a descendant of his. At the bottom of the sea, Godzilla recovers and roars over Mecha-King Ghidorah's remains.

Godzilla Time travel theory: when the Futurians erased Godzilla from history you expect people to ask whats a Godzilla however to awnser the questions we have to look back at the original Gojira.
In a presentation to Japanese officials Professor Kyohei Yamane theorizes that Godzilla is a hybrid of land and sea reptiles that has lived in ocean trenches where it fed on fish and other deep sea organisms, but the recent H-Bomb test (the Bikini Atoll test took place on March 1, 1954) had disturbed the monsters natural habitat and brought it to the surface. Yamane supports his theory with evidence recovered from one of Godzillas footprints; sand from an undersea mineral deposit dated back to the Jurassic Period, and a prehistoric arthropod called a trilobite that has been thought extinct for 250 million years. The trilobites presence further suggests that Godzilla came from an undersea pocket where prehistoric animals still lived. While Yamanes theory is never officially confirmed in Gojira, it is the only explanation ever given by the monsters creators Tomoyuki Tanaka and Ishiro Honda. Tohos English language materials for the film describe Godzilla as an immensely huge reptile said to have inhabited the seas two million years ago, and none of the following entries in the first cycle of Godzilla films contradict what was established in Gojira. If Godzilla were completely erased from history, no one would be aware of the monster and all the death and destruction Godzilla caused in the previous two films would have never occurred. None of that happens; in fact, later Heisei movies (Godzilla vs Spacegodzilla)1994 &(Godzilla vs Destroyah)1995 would refer back to events from those films so they clearly were not erased from the timeline. The only corroboration that Godzilla had disappeared comes from the Japanese Self Defense Force the same JSDF that could not track Godzillas underwater movements in Godzilla Vs Biollante. Kazuki Omori showed that if Godzilla moved unexpectedly the JSDF would lose him. In an old news article Terasawa finally uncovers the true origin of the Heisei Godzilla and thats exactly what happened. Miki senses Godzilla not the dinosaur moving slowly in the Bering Sea, and satellite photos of the location she indicated confirm her vision. Terasawa doesnt understand why Godzilla still exists, but Emi explains that if the dinosaur had come into contact with radioactive materials at any time after 1944 it could have been transformed into Godzilla. Now knowing that Godzilla was never erased from history, Terasawa tries to figure out what went wrong. He digs through the archives at Mu and finds a news report from the 1970s about a Russian nuclear submarine sinking in the exact spot the dinosaur had been moved to. Terasawa realizes that this nuclear accident mutated the dinosaur into the Godzilla who first attacked in 1984. His theory had been wrong; by going to 1944 and moving the dinosaur to the Bering Sea the Futurians didn't uncreate the original Godzilla, they caused the creation of the second Godzilla.

The tone of film has tragedy in with the characters and Monsters. When our main characters go back in time to make sure Godzilla isn't born Emmy leaves the Dorats on Lagos Island but when they return to the present King Ghidorah is causing problems you feel sad for the Dorats because due to the first Atomic bomb test turned these cute creatures into a horrible monster. Shindo was the commander of the Lagos garrison during WWII after the Godzillasaurus saves his garrison he feels bad that he cant take him with them and tells the dinosaur that the garrison will never forget how it saved their lives thus gives him a salute after the war Shindo rebuilds Japan and has never forgotten the dinosaur till earlier in the film Terasawa told him that the dinosaur had turned into Godzilla who attacked Japan in 1954 he then feels bad for what he did later after the main characters go back in time. King Ghidorah appears and attacks What Shindo created so we have the dinosaur out of retribution he sends a nuclear Submarine to create Godzilla with the hope that the Dinosaur will save what Shindo had built. It succeeds but after Godzilla kills King Ghidorah Shino realizes that he had created a monster and he condemned the dinosaur after what he did now when Godzilla starts destroying all that he had built he has to face penance with what he has done. So when he and Godzilla meet face to face Godzilla doesnt want to kill Shindo but Shindo wants to be forgiven for turning the dinosaur into Godzilla and so Godzilla roars then releases then blasts Shindo with his Atomic Breath and smashes through the building Shindo was in.
Characters: The characters are ok only Shindo stands out as the best like Dr Serizawa and Gondo altogether.

Monsters: Godzillasaurus is a great design for how Godzilla was before being mutated. Dorats are ok. King Ghidorah looks menacing and his design is much better. Godzilla is now larger and more powerful then he was in the 1980s the design is really great. Mecha-King Ghidorah is a great cyborg and it shows with a great design.

Music: I love the music because Akira Ifukube is back and the musical scores show for it.

3948134,3,B002LHGI1K,"First, there's not a thing wrong with the quality of the discs. Sound is as good as the other reviews say it is, and it's grand to have a Japanese sound track, because most of the so-called Heisei series are, for me, extremely annoying to sit through with the English track playing, particularly ""Ghidorah."" A high school drama club could have done far better work for less money; I groan for the days of Titra studios.
""Ghidorah"" isn't a good movie. Not many on the Heisei series ever were, and it's no wonder the movies being made during this period took so long to establish themselves outside of Japan. About the same time that Ghidorah was made, Terminator 2 was raking in huge cash, and Toho seemed to think that people wanted time-travel subplots in their movies. And cyborgs with melted flesh. They didn't---not in Godzilla films, at least, because the Japanese public stayed away from Ghidorah in droves.
The best part, naturally, are the battles between Godzilla and Ghidorah, and it's always great to see Yoshio Tsuchiya in anything. I only wish he'd been given more to do.
""Mothra"" is a little better. Akira Takarada is back, and so is the derivative spirit of Ghidorah, in the form of a poorly staged scene shamelessly ripped off from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""
In Mothra, Godzilla seems more of a supporting presence, without much of anything to do until the last reel. Battra looks great as a larva, spooky and devastating, but as an adult reminds me much more of an 80s hair band guitar---the swirly colors on its wings don't evoke the dark awe such a creature should. Over and over, the twin fairies---the Cosmos---refer to Battra as the Black Mothra. Battra certainly ain't black, though it should have been.
Oh, well. These are Toho's movies, not mine. And I'm glad to have them in the native Japanese. I'll just shut up and watch em.",1448150400,2,1853,4.6871165644171775

3948137,4,B002LHGI1K,"2 of the Big Guy's most notable outings during the 90's ""Heisei era"" of films are packaged together here in a decent Blu-ray release and, surprisingly, are each on their own separate disc. These don't have that magical, timeless quality that the 60's & 70's films do, but they can still be a lot of fun. The effects, while still adhering to the time-honored tradition of man-in-suit & expansive miniatures, get a nice upgrade in the level of detail. Both Godzilla's signature atomic breath & the M.A.S.E.R. tank beam optical effects have certainly come a long way since the old days.

The first entry features the return of Godzilla's most infamous arch-villain, the fantastical three-headed space dragon, King Ghidorah. Here, the triple threat terror is given an absurd new origin that takes away some of the mystery which made him so iconically cool in the first place. The entire time-travel angle of the movie is fun but incredibly non-nonsensical. Convenient coincidences abound, and there are plot holes big enough for Ghidorah himself to fly through without touching sides. Still, it's an undeniable visual feast for the eyes when KG finally squares off against the Big G in a visceral, tooth & claw confrontation. In the second of the two films, Godzilla's sometime enemy/ sometimes pal, Mothra makes her first 90's series' appearance. The addition of the monster Battra, (a sort of anti-Mothra), is kind of fun even though the idea feels rushed and unoriginal.

Both films look pretty good on these Blu-rays from Sony. No extras except the original Japanese trailers for each film. If you're a fan of Godzilla or you have friends or kids who are then these two movies will be a solid, enjoyable purchase. The other double Blu-ray release to look for pairs the super-excellent rock'em sock'em GODZILLA VS. MECHAGODZILLA II, with the sadly bland (and criminally boring) yawnfest, GODZILLA vs. SPACEGODZILLA. True G-Fans will want 'em all, regardless. It's Godzilla, so that's all you need to know! 4 STARS for these two hi-def presentation G-films.",1435968000,6,2055,5.041176470588235

3948148,5,B002LHGI1K,Another of the best Godzilla video series you'll never see in the states. This is due to the extras that the U.S. DVDs most of the time just don't have. Of course it's in Japanese  but still great fun. This one is one of the best of the 2nd generation of Godzilla films that started in 1984 with Godzilla and ended in 1995 with Godzilla vs. Destroyer. It won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Special effects in 1991 and I would have to agree. The transformation of King Ghidorah to the cyborg Mecha King Ghidorah is absolutely fantastic!,1416873600,,540,4.454545454545454

These old Godzilla movies are much, much better without the horrible dubbed English dialog. I'd rather have purchased standard resolution DVDs, but there is no Japanese language version available at this time, so this was the best solution. Maybe I'll buy a Blu-Ray player. Eventually.

3948151,5,B002LHGI1K,"First off let me just say if you are a Godzilla fan DO NOT hesitate on getting The Toho Godzilla Collection blu ray films. They are a must have! I've been a Godzilla fan since 5 years old. I'm a 90's kid so I grew up with these films. Seeing this be remastered in high definition if just something very special. You get two films in 1080p HD. Now please note since this is blu ray there are certain mishaps that show up on film. ha what I mean by that is for example see King Ghidorah in ""Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah"" flying and destroying cities, you can see the wires holding him up al well as other wires operating his neck movements as he fights Godzilla. Just little things like that stick out. but to me it doesn't take away from the action. So please if you're thinking about getting this or the rest DO IT! you won't be disappointed.

3948156,5,B002LHGI1K,"Godzilla Vs. King Ghidorah is awesome. It is everything the 2014 wasn't, lots of direct shot Godzilla fighting. King Ghidorah destroying Japan is awesome. Bringing WWII into it is awesome. Sure it's hokey and the FX aren't as good as they would be now. This movie has the Godzilla spirit. I'd love to see a Quentin Tarantino interpretation of this movie. Time travel, wacky dialogue, WWII, monster fights, even the three baby ""dorats"" that became King Ghidorah were fun. This movie was fun. Now to watch VS. Mothra. Watching with Japanese sound and English subtitles makes this feel so much better than with dubbing. Complaining about this version of the credits and giving this affordable double Blueray release 1 star is absolutely nuts. It comes with free HD vudu digital versions of both movies too. I don't particularly like the silly 60's Godzilla and I disliked the 2014 Godzilla but I LOVE this era of Godzilla. King Ghidorah is AWESOME!!!",1409875200,2,947,4.925

3948160,1,B002LHGI1K,"First, I should point out that I am a pretty aggressive collector (have been since childhood), having gotten 3 or 4 different versions of these films: Taped off the TV, official VHS, DVDs of questionable origin (usually found on eBay), and the Hong Kong R3 release. Of all of these, the Hong Kong ones sport the best combination of quality and, IMO, ""purity."" I am a bit OCD when it comes to my Japanese films; I tend to like seeing the original Japanese title cards unobscured by English text layovers (big issue with Sony's Millennium era releases), and I have a reasonable expectation to see the end credits, both for the music and sometimes for the footage that will continue playing (especially on the Heisei era Godzilla films).

My MAJOR gripe with these was that I was led to believe through an article (http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2014/04/01/sony-provides-new-details-for-toho-godzilla-collection-blu-rays/) that these would contain the original, uncut versions of these films. They do not. They are exactly the same format as the VHS releases from 16 years ago. That is to say: no Toho logo, gutted opening titles (only three or four actors credited), hard sub on the film's title card, and zero end credits. The bump in quality isn't really noticeable, especially in the underwater opening of GvKG, which fuels my suspicion that this may have actually been a direct transfer from VHS (a la ADV's Gamera: GOTU DVD several years back).

In short, if you absolutely must have this in your collection, and you do not have the means to acquire or play imported versions of these films, I guess this is your best shot: they are dual language (at the very least), and they're in a digital format. And, at least on Amazon, they're cheap.

If you're like me and you want the original, unedited film from beginning to end, save your money for the import.

3948163,4,B002LHGI1K,"These are Japanese monster movies with all the narm and obvious wires and the obvious man-in-a-rubber suit you'd expect from Kaiju films. The biggest problem I found with this was audio. If anyone is familiar with Dragon Ball Z where the the original Japanese audio sounds extremely old and outdated, the reverse is true on these Godzilla movies. Not only is the English dubbing very bad, but it's in tinny mono whereas the Japanese audio is high fidelity stereo that you'd actually expect from movies released in 1991 and 1992. What's worse is that this is apparently the first time these movies have ever been released with a Japanese track. That means that it wasn't until 2014 that American audiences can get the original stereo audio. That's sad. For this Blu-ray, they should have remixed or redubbed the English track or not had one at all. That being said, Japanese is the default audio track.",1406332800,,901,4.819354838709677

Particularly Pacafic Islands during WW2 from the Japanese point of view.

Mothra offers up some nice new things mainly the other corrupted moth monster Batra. Sadly it really limits the effects as we have a movie of circling puppets buzzing around Godzilla. solid middle of the road Heisei movie.",1402876800,2,626,4.961904761904762

As for the movies....

4 stars for G vs KG

Godzilla's look was awesome! King Ghidorah looked awesome!
Beam fights, and KG's transformation to Mecha King Ghidorah was excellent.
I liked the origin for Godzilla from Godzillasaurus to Godzilla.
However this movie was loaded with plot holes. The whole time travel thing got out of hand.
The score was very impressive, with the flaw of plot holes, this movie still an excellent entry into the series.

3 stars for Godzilla vs Mothra. I felt this was the weakest of the series.
The movie got a little preachy at times. The special effects felt dated and rushed.
Battora looked great and was animated well. Mothra looked too much like a puppet. I thought it looked more bug like in the 1964 Godzilla vs Mothra.
The weak effects and story are compensated by steady action and great monster fights. The glory of beam fights is continued in this film.",1401062400,3,1001,4.735632183908046

3948178,4,B002LHGI1K,"Until recently, it was often tough to find decent versions of the Godzilla films in the United States. Case in point: ""Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah,"" which was previously available only on a lousy DVD featuring bad English dubbing, no Japanese language track and a mediocre pan-and-scan print. Yikes!

This blu ray release is a huge improvement. It's in proper widescreen, the picture quality is good (considering the age of the material), and you can choose to watch the film in Japanese with a respectful set of subtitles. So, you no longer have to endure stupid dubbed lines like ""oh boy yes, it's Emmy [coming to the rescue]!"" Subtitled, the line takes the much less embarrassing form of ""All right, [it's] Emmy!"" Whew, what a relief. It's too bad that the blu ray doesn't have any decent special features, but at least the movies themselves receive good treatment.

Ah yes, I almost forgot that there are two movies in this set. The second is ""Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earth,"" and it also looks good on blu ray. Alas, I don't really care for the movie much; it's a rather tepid remake of the 1960s clash between Mothra and the Big G, which had a better script. For me, the Ghidorah film is the real prize here; it has a wild, time-travel inspired plot, groovy special effects and even a few slightly interesting characters. But on the negative side, the film is weighed down by a degree of anti-American sentiment that reaches its peak during a tacky World War II battle segment; for some viewers, this may (understandably) spoil the fun.

Why did the Futurians even stop off in 1992 the first time?
Why didn't the Futurians research where to drop the dinosaur?
Why didn't they stop Emmy from talking to the government?
And worst of all, after Emmy proved herself to be a traitor, why did they let her work on Android M-11 unsupervised?

And then there's the cringeworthy English scenes...  ""Major Spielberg""???  really???
And who in their right mind gives nuclear waste to a private company that owns it's own nuclear powered ballistic missile sub???
