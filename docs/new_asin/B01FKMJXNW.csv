7750198,1,B01FKMJXNW,Couldn't understand a word that the dresser said!,1465084800,6,49,5.25
7750199,5,B01FKMJXNW,"Ronald Harwood has adapted his very successful play THE DRESSER for the screen and under Richard Eyres direction and the consummate skills of a brilliant cast this made for television film is one of the finest pieces of cinema of the year.
The story is as much about the aging process as it is about the frustrations and challenges of being on the stage a bit past the moment when lines can be remembered and directions not as natural as once they were become a challenge. It is also a very fine study of British theater  not the glowing lights Broadway type, but the little touring countries that brought and bring Shakespeare to the people in the little towns where the audiences respect theater.

The film opens during the blitz of England during WW II in a rundown old theater that despite the blitz an audience has packed the house for a production by a small, struggling theater company of Shakespeares King Lear. The titular head of the company (Sarah Lancashire) worries that ageing actor 'Sir' (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife Her Ladyship (Emily Watson) will be able to perform. 'Sir' is plainly unwell, discharging himself from hospital and Her Ladyship believes he should cancel his upcoming performance of 'King Lear'. However Norman (Ian McKellen), his outspoken, gay dresser disagrees and is determined that the show will go on, cajoling the confused 'Sir' into giving a performance - one which will be his swansong, at the same time drawing a parallel between King Lear and his fool as Norman, despite ultimate disappointment, serves his master.

The relationship between Sir and Norman is profound and in the end very touching. Hopkins and McKellen and Watson are in top form and are ably supported by Lancashire, Edward Fox (unrecognizable in his costume as the Fool), and Vanessa Kirby. This is a splendid film on every count and one that deserves many awards. Grady Harp, June 16",1465084800,10,1897,4.848765432098766

The Eyre's movie is the best example: It is not a movie and it is not a properly staged play in the theater.

7750226,2,B01FKMJXNW,"The 1983 film version of Ronald Harwood's play is one of my favorite films, revisited every year through my public library, but has been unavailable on DVD for some years now.  I thought this version might fill that gap in my collection and be an enjoyable alternate version of this ode to 'the roar of the greasepaint' of which I am so fond.  Both of our leads are esteemed Knights of the British Empire, justifiably rewarded for their contributions to their profession; despite sharing that honor and being peers in the business for a combined total of 100+ years, incredibly, these two actors had never worked together before.  I have admired them individually in other projects, and I love this material--so imagine my disbelief and disappointment that this much anticipated TV film, adapted and directed by Richard Eyre, no stranger to backstage dramas (""Stage Beauty"" is another favorite) turned out to be so limp, lifeless and dare I say . .with a whiff of amateurishness about it all?  Surely *some*, if not all of this lackluster result must be attributed to the direction, but I found both McKellen and Hopkins to be decidedly off-form for the duration, particularly Hopkins.  As 'Sir', the imperious though increasingly demented impresario/star of a troupe of Shakespearean actors attempting to put on a production of ""King Lear"" in the midst of a Luftwaffe blitz in the North of England in 1940, and modeled by the playwright after his former employer, the legendary Shakespearean thespian Sir Donald Wolfit, the call was to go much bigger and blusterier.  This is the epitome of scene-chewing parts, and Albie Finney chewed the scenery with glee in his portrayal.  There must be a contrast between the bombastic yet mentally unraveling Sir and his dresser, Norman, who provides the calm, steady center of Sir's backstage world, and who exhibits moments of inner steel when dealing with his recalcitrant boss despite nervous tendencies and a fondness for the bottle of brandy he keeps in his back pocket.  Norman was himself a former actor until an unfortunate attack of stage fright rendered him unable to perform and resulted in a nervous breakdown.  But he has been able to stay involved in the world of the theatre behind the scenes as Sir's dresser, cheerer-upper and chief confidant--the Fool to Sir's Lear.  Norman by turns plays the stern Mummy or the sycophantic courtier, whichever Sir's mood calls for in a given moment.

Though Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney were precisely the same age, a visual gap of 30 years is created by the makeup department and Finney's bravura turn as a septuagenarian coming completely unglued, but still capable of flashes of lucidity and vigor.  (Both actors were 43 at the time.)  McKellen at 77 is only a year younger than Hopkins at 78.  I don't know if it is more or less common for a dresser to be the same age as his/her employer or significantly younger, but for me it plays better and more convincingly if the master/disciple relationship between these two characters is boosted by a visual age gap suggesting that Norman is a younger man than his boss.  This is not the fatal flaw however.  The major problem is the quite nearly monochromatic tone of both actors.  Neither is dynamic, offering a palette of different moods or energy levels throughout, but both stay distressingly one-note in their respective performances.  Hopkins in particular recites his lines at though he were moving on autopilot through a table reading.  He is capable of bluster and fire; we have seen it in other parts--Richard the Lionheart or Major Ludlow in 'Legends of the Fall' both have elements of the Sir ego and volume.  The larger-than-life Sir, a man frantically trying to hold onto the thread of sanity and control over his company needs to rage more against the dying of the light.  Hopkins opts to go out with a whimper.  Also, Sir Tony, who has had a well-publicized weight loss in recent years does not seem quite large enough physically to fill up Sir's space.  He cuts a more elegant figure than Finney, with his bull-in-a-china-shop physicality did, but elegance is really not is what is called for here.  We need to see a man at the literal end of his rope and the dishevelment and physical deterioration that accompanies the mental deterioration.  Hopkins is entirely too composed, though he gives us a flash of Finney's fire during the ""I am surrounded by vipers!"" speech.

McKellen's equally low-key take is not as inappropriate to Norman, but he also makes some odd, detracting acting decisions.  Possibly to convey Norman's lower-class origins and subordinate/menial position within the company, he speaks in a mumbling fashion like his mouth is full of marbles, rendering him very difficult to understand, and his stooped shambling gives Norman the aura of a kicked dog.  With wispy grey strands of hair plastered to his skull and a perpetual vague semi-smile on his face that gives him a mixed air of being sinister and/or not very bright, I was most reminded of Smagol/Gollum from 'Lord of the Rings'.  He acts more like the company's mentally challenged janitor than the invaluable right hand of the star.

Sarah Lancashire takes the role of Madge, the stage manageress, previously inhabited by the superb Dame Eileen Atkins, and Emily Watson is 'Her Ladyship', Sir's younger wife and his 'Cordelia'.  Edward Fox, the nominal villain of the earlier production as the unctuous 'Mr. Oxenby' here appears as the Fool, but he is unrecognizable behind a full face of demented clown makeup that is more reminiscent of Stephen King's ""It"".  This version is a filmed stage play, not the feature film adaptation of its predecessor, and unlike it, does not venture outside of the confines of the theatre.  The earlier film was able to do so and thereby provide the audience with additional background scenes which can only be described in monologues here.  That, I expected, but I did miss the introductions to the other personnel in the company which we got in the earlier film.  In this version, apart from a very few brief interruptions from the two women and the Fool, all the dialogue takes place exclusively between Norman and Sir.  With both actors seeming very like they had downed several Xanax prior to cameras rolling, dear readers, I fell asleep--a clear indicator of my lack of investment in these proceedings.

While I am glad the Sirs finally got to share the screen together, this result is decidedly not representative of their combined talents.  It's hard to believe anyone involved would feel that this is top-notch work.  The whole thing played extremely perfunctory to me, and the visuals are exceedingly dank to look at.  This is a well-intentioned but ultimately completely unnecessary and pointless remake.  I would much rather see a rerelease of the 1983 film, which deserves all the laurels I can give.  This, I'm donating to my public library because I have no desire to lay eyeballs on it again.",1479772800,,6980,4.915601023017903

It is the culmination of a lifetime's experience.  McKellen is just as entrancing and winning as the titular character - to  be able to see these two giants of the stage essay such wonderful parts, playing off one another, is a rare treat. Kudos also go to the supporting cast, especially the grand Edward Fox whose tender speech about acting near the film's end is especially poignant.  Is it better than the 1983 version?

7750252,3,B01FKMJXNW,"I made the mistake of ordering the Blu-ray of this movie, but I'll probably return it. After noticing that the picture quality seemed no better than a regular DVD, I checked the disc. Sure enough, no Blu-ray symbol on the disc although the snap-case was clearly labled ""Blu-ray Disc"". Am I the only one this has happened to? Also, there is no menu on my disc and no extras. I tried everything to find a menu and/or a popup menu and/or subtitles and/or anything in addition to the movie, but couldn't ferret out anything. Despite this the back of the case clearly states that the disc contains ""Special Features --- 'From Stage to Screen' and 'Master & Assistant'."" To add insult to injury, the DVD looks suspiciously like a DVD-R, not a commercially produced DVD.

As for this TV adaptation of the play ""The Dresser"", I don't think it holds up when compared to the 1983 movie adaptation starring Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. First of all, it seems to me that Ian McKellen was miscast as the dresser and, for the most part, I felt Anthony Hopkins failed to portray his character with the needed imperious yet vulnerable gravitas to make him both compelling and sympathetic. Don't get me wrong, I think both McKellen and Hopkins are both superb actors. But superb actors aren't necessarily superb in all parts. McKellen, especially, seemed to be unsuitable for his role. He does something with his voice that made a great deal of his dialogue unintelligible to this American, and his mincing around seemed to be a caricature of the person he played, rather than part of his identity. But Courtenay, in the 1983 movie adaptation, is spot on and completely believable. Every one of his lines (which are perfectly intelligible, by the way), and each one of his gestures, are impeccably interpreted and absolutely convincing.

Ronald Harwood, who wrote the original play, actually was a dresser for the Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit upon whom Harwood based his play. Sir Wolfit's acting style on stage would undoubtedly be considered histrionic and hammy today, but it was an accepted convention and he was considered one of the finest Shakespearean actors of his time. Unlike Hopkins, Albert Finney captured that dated acting style perfectly when his character performed on stage. Also, unlike Hopkins, Finney's labored breathing and baleful sweating portrayed the actor as being dangerously infirm and on the verge of a heart attack throughout the movie. When Finney's character succumbs at the end of the movie it seems so poignant because we know that a great, but very flawed light has finally been extinguished and those who have been living in his shadow will now have to find their way in darkness. Hopkins, on the other hand, does sweat a lot but seemingly from exertion rather than from bad health, and his death at the end appeared to me to be more of a whimper than a gut-wrenching bang.

The 1983 movie version was expanded to include scenes outside of the theater, and the play's dialogue was tightened. It was a ""movie version"" of the play, rather than the ""filmed play"" that we have here. Because it wasn't constrained to just the theater, I found the Finney / Courtenay adaptation to be more visually interesting. And personally, in this new Hopkins / McKellen adaptation I found the spacious dressing room of the star in this aging provincial theater to be improbable and distracting, given what little I know of British theater backstages. It appeared to be more like the set of stage play (which, I think, it was) rather than a real place. But perhaps I'm now swatting at gnats.

However, the one really bright spot in this new movie adaptation is toward the end when Edward Fox (who plays Thornton) gives a moving speech to Hopkins. With the weight of forsakened dreams on his shoulders, Fox delivers each line, each word, with an underplayed and restrained emotion that tugs at your heart. Unfortunately, the film's editor kept cutting back to Hopkins during Fox's speech so, I suspect, we could see the effect the speech was having on ""Sir"". But at that point I didn't care, and I almost screamed at my television, ""Keep the dang camera on Fox for heaven's sake!"" For my money Edward Fox, who played a different part in the 1983 movie version, steals the whole show in that all-too-short scene and proves that ""there are no small parts, just small actors."" What a performance!

7750268,5,B01FKMJXNW,"The Dresser,"" starring Ian McKellen and Anthony Hopkins, is the second screen adaptation of the play by Ronald Harwood. During a night at a small English regional theatre during World War II, a troupe of touring actors is about to stage a production of Shakespeares King Lear. Though the night is filled with the sounds of war  bombs falling and air raid sirens wailing  the curtain is going up in one hour. However, Sir (Hopkins), the actor playing Lear, is nowhere to be found. His dresser, Norman (McKellen), does his best to assure the company that the show will go on as scheduled. As the minutes tick by, Sir reflects on his lifelong career accomplishments and seeks to resolve shaky friendships with those in the company before the final curtain.

This marks the first performance featuring both Hopkins and McKellen, and its sheer pleasure watching these two veterans. Though the film doesnt open up the stage plays action much, the performances are sufficiently riveting to sustain our attention. The plot works both as a literal look at an acting troupe dealing with myriad problems all in the service of putting on a performance and as a parallel to the play being staged. Both Lear and Sir look back over their lives, pondering their worth and the effect they have had on those close to them. As we watch Norman get Sir ready for his performance, we see not merely an actor and his employee, but a deep relationship carved over many years.

The DVD release contains two featurettes that chronicle the movies journey from its theatrical origin (From Stage to Screen) and the relationship of the main characters (Master & Assistant).",1468627200,,1643,4.8362989323843415
7750269,3,B01FKMJXNW,"As a previous comment suggests, the sound recording is poor; I will have to tinker with an audio editor. Mr. Hopkins performance is of course the major question, as compared to Sir Albert Finney. Ian McKellen brings a complete rethinking to his dresser which seems to consist entirely of an imaginary backstory featuring WWII British bombing. Thats not enough. Where is the fierce wrangling over theatre positions, or McKellens assumption of Sirs arrogance in matters of theatre competence. Hopkins scales everything he does for a film or tv production, which makes it clear as far as it goes, but it never in one line reaches the sparks of wisdom Sir actually does share with Shakespeare. Quite honestly, it is impossible not to notice the cruel judgment Olivier uttered about Hopkins audition of Othello. In short, we have a play, with much restored in dialogue which should have remained cut; a truly great Shakespearean actor (McKellen) trying to underplay a star of film who simply doesnt have a Lear or Othello in him. Every single line must be arbitrarily and often stupidly uttered by Hopkins. This is not surprise or fresh reading; this is rude and inept. Take Shakespeare in his own play and demonstrate that at one time, in one performance, you got it and can play it. Hopkins cannot. And his nervous breakdown/death was bad Willy Loman. I understand that McKellen wants to play with other actors of comparable insight and experience. This is a bad acting lesson in which the real star who understands playing Shakespeare even in the 21st Century studiously avoids clash, or intellect, or style just in order not to show up Hopkins.  I feel cheated by both of them: Hopkins has no great stage-acting in him, and McKellen could have given us a really original take on Norman. Why 3 stars? I simply cannot bring myself to give these actors bad marks for simply not trying.",1468195200,,1881,4.841614906832298

8760932,5,B01FKMJXNW,"I normally watch comedy or feel-good happy-ending movies (escapism). But with two of the finest British actors ever, I had to watch this movie. Amazon's teaser describes it as ""wickedly funny and moving,"" but having seen the stage play years ago, I expected it to be more moving than funny, at least for me, and it was.
McKellen is such a master at finding a fresh way to portray a character that still feels right, still feels like the character you've seen or read about before, only better, more multi-dimensional, but never overdone. The most diverse actor I can think of, McKellen can play anything from a clock (Beauty and the Beast) to a murderer (DaVinci Code). Here, there's a lot of diversity in one role, Norman. He pampers and cajoles his actor/boss, ""Sir,"" like a nursemaid. He threatens a young woman with violence and blackmail in order to protect Sir. Norman suffers so much pain because he wanted to act, but was never given the chance. He lives through Sir, grabbing a crumb of fulfillment here and there, as by his ability to recite any line in any Shakespearian play when Sir needs reminding. Yet Norman is insecure about making a simple pre-curtain announcement to the audience. In my opinion, Norman rivals Dickens' character Bradley Headstone for pathos, and is ideal for someone of McKellen's talent.
Hopkins' Sir is 500% convincing as a man who is self-centered to the point of sociopathy. And now, the sociopath has dementia on top of it all! (And I wasn't just convinced because, sometimes, I looked at Sir's and saw Hannibal Lecter.) You don't like Sir, he infuriates you, yet you still feel sorry for him.
The supporting actors are superb. I'd write more about them, but this is too long already.",1528588800,,1725,4.7725752508361206
