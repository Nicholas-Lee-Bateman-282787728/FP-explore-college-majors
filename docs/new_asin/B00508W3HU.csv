8450959,4,B00508W3HU,"Jimmy Durante plays Moxie Slaight who is in search of a new gag writer
for his radio program which he shares with the loopy Lupe Velez.
The plot is very thin, but there are some very nice moments: Jimmy sings
""Hot Pattata"" and is joined by Lupe as they sing ""I'm Just Putty
In Your Hands"". Lupe sings ""Oh Me! Oh My! Oh You!"". The great Mills Brothers
perform two songs: ""Swing It Sister"" and ""Money In My Clothes"".
The cast includes Norman Foster, William Gargan and
Marian Nixon with some very familiar supporting players:
Eugene Pallette, Sterling Holloway and Franklin Pangborn.

The picture and sound quality are quite good. There are no extras.",1354924800,,649,4.692982456140351
8450960,4,B00508W3HU,"This is a Depression era gem to watch; not a cinematic classic, but a fabulous supporting cast (Eugene Pallette, Franklin Pangporn sans mustache). This a camp classic, though, and a gas to watch. Buyer beware: This is a dvd-r, not a dvd, and Warner Bros. Archives sells it for $19.99...and sometimes (when there is a sale) you get free shipping too.",1334966400,,349,4.737704918032787
