2678725,2,B000JRYP0K,"After a tremendous amount of research, I was able to get to the bottom of the issue w/the HD version of Atlas/Aust. Revealed. I have confirmed that a firmware update is available from Toshiba players that will resolve the playback issues. A Microsoft update is currently not available but will be soon.",1172102400,2,302,4.826923076923077
2678726,1,B000JRYP0K,I got all four Discovery HD DVD's. Brazil and China work fine and Italy and Australia do not. I returned them to Amazon and the replacements did not work either. Then I started reading and found many other people with the same problem which is caused by a coding problem with these two disc's. It's a shame Discovery did such a poor job making sure these disc's were playable especially considering how few different models of HD DVD Players there are out on the market.,1171756800,2,470,4.541176470588235
2678727,1,B000JRYP0K,"This title will not play in my Toshiba HD-XA2 DVD player. It locks up the player and I have to turn it off and back on to get the player to function again.

If you know why this might be, please do let me know. All other HD-DVD titles and movies I've tried play fine (have not tried another Discovery Channel title though).",1171324800,2,323,4.126984126984127

2678729,1,B000JRYP0K,This batch of botched disks has tarnished my image of this series.  The whole production was in a class of its own until the manufacturing crew busted.,1170979200,3,151,4.592592592592593
2678730,1,B000JRYP0K,"I have done some researching online and found out that these 2 HD-DVDs have been recorded in a different way from the Brazil & China which do work. DO NOT ORDER this product until they have created a working batch. I have also spoken with Discovery Channel and they advised they are aware of the problem and are trying to get this problem resolved. I was advised to return the product from where I bought it and keep checking back with them. Be very cautious who you purchase this from. You don't want to order a defective title and then not be able to get your refund. The only ones working at this time as mentioned above is Brazil and China, you should be ok ordering those.",1170806400,3,677,4.338582677165355
2678731,1,B000JRYP0K,I have a new Toshiba XA2 and have played many new HD DVDs on it. This one does not play. A message comes up that something is wrong with the disk. Will return to Amazon.,1170720000,3,169,3.857142857142857
2678732,1,B000JRYP0K,"You've been warned...  I called Microsoft and they said for now, they are aware of the problem, no solution yet, not sure if there will be a solution either. The best bet is to replace the disk and hope for Discovery Channel to have a correctly encoded disk for me. Bummer...

From avsforum, China Revealed and Brazil Revealed both are working.  I might have to return 2 titles I have from amazon.com.",1170633600,3,401,4.541666666666667
2678755,5,B000JRYP0K,"I really fascinated with the animals, the people, the culture and the places of the land of Australia!  I like Russell Crowe, a New Zealander and Australian actor, who narrates this documentary.",1256342400,,194,5.0625
2678756,3,B000JRYP0K,"It was ok. I was hoping to see more images of australias landscape. That is the main reason I got a blu-ray player in the first place so I could see beautiful images of earth and such, not images of dirty aborigines and ugly tanker ships. (I have nothing against aborigines though)",1237593600,,281,4.423076923076923
2678757,4,B000JRYP0K,A bit long but worth it! The pictures are very vivid and the senior citizens I showed it to loved it -- and they're a very tough crowd to please!,1232323200,,145,3.8666666666666667
2678758,2,B000JRYP0K,"This is our second documentary by Discovery, and our second disappointment.

The graphics were crisp and colorful which is why we got this in Blu, but the content and story were nothing but common and boring.",1231200000,3,208,4.777777777777778

As a french living in Australia i find this movie very acute about the australian icons; everything is told about and it's not boring. It could be good to use this movie in australian schools (or in other countries) to talk the students about some parts of their country they don't know. Unfortunately the zone for this dvd is only zone 1, which is the american one, and unless you've got a multizone dvd player (like me)you can't see it. It's a pity.",1223596800,10,637,6.088888888888889
2678760,5,B000JRYP0K,This is a true work of cinematic art. I saw my own country in a new light. Fabulous. Made me home sick for the simple life. If your planning a trip to Australia any time soon........this is a must see.  As we aussie's say....G'DAY MATE. and welcome home.,1209340800,5,254,4.291666666666667
2678761,3,B000JRYP0K,"Australia has always been of interest to me.  I have known some Aussies and they've always struck me as being laid back and eager to have fun.  This travel documentary narrated by Russell Crowe takes you into areas of Australia you didn't know existed and explores the land and its diversity of people. I was disappointed in this presentation in that it was heavy on the people, especially those Aborigines in the Outback and the rural sheep and cattle ranchers, and light on things I expected to see but didn't.  I wanted to see more of the South Coast, the Mountains, and Tasmania. Too much time was spent on a Vietnamese commedian who immigrated after Saigon fell, and a young woman swimmer in an iron woman competition, and a young female rancher in the Outback. Even though the photography and editing were superb, the content was lacking and I was disappointed. This could have been a lot better.",1208390400,2,902,4.69620253164557
2678762,1,B000JRYP0K,"Guys, don't waste your time with this video. I have China, Brasil and Italy Discovery Channel and BY FAR...this is the worst one (I highly recommend the others!)

Basically you can't hear the narrator. Crowe's voice is TOO low and its impossible to listen too. My girlfriend asked to turn on the ""subtitle"" function because it was sooo bad.....we both fell asleep within 10 mins. (Its doesnt support subtitle features)

Again, don't purchase this series (Australia). HORRIBLE AUDIO!",1206230400,4,482,5.166666666666667
2678763,5,B000JRYP0K,This is one of the best documentaries of a nation i have ever seen. You get a look at the many different ways Australians have adapted to and use their land. The footage is beautiful. It surely made me want to move to Australia.,1202428800,,228,4.204545454545454
2678764,5,B000JRYP0K,"It is a shame that there are people who don't bother to READ what these documentaries are about BEFORE they buy them and are disappointed.

The oft-stated aim of Discovery Atlas is not a history lesson ... it is a unique look at countries through the eyes and personal stories of a select group of individuals.

What better ways to learn the true feelings and emotions than by this manner.

Exquisitely shot, wonderfully narrated, these videos provide a unique look into each of these nations that one would not otherwise EVER be party to.",1198800000,13,539,4.712765957446808
2678775,3,B000JRYP0K,"I bought the Italy, China and Ausatralia ATLAS from discovery. This one is kind of boring. I think the stories told are very weak. Anyway it shows good images in HD. The other two are much better.",1192924800,3,196,4.324324324324325
2678776,5,B000JRYP0K,"This show is one of a kind, beautiful and informative, if you liked Planet Earth this is a must have.",1190073600,4,101,4.1
2678777,2,B000JRYP0K,"Although this is an interesting program and very well produced with high quality video (as you would expect from a Blu-ray DVD), it is sadly, and badly let down by poor narration by Russell Crowe, with his boring mono-tone voice. He is not up to the standard required. Just why Discovery Channel chose him as a narrator is beyond me, when Australia has many excellent documentary narrators such as Jack Thompson.
Would not have purchased this DVD if I had known who had narrated it.",1187827200,4,482,4.682352941176471
2678778,5,B000JRYP0K,"Very nice, especially in BluRay. The photography is incredible, and it is very pleasureable to watch.  It's just like being in and around the people and places of Australia.  Must see!",1182384000,8,184,4.903225806451613
2678779,4,B000JRYP0K,"Fortunately, my Toshiba HD-A2 with the latest firmware 1.5 can play this disc without any problem. I really enjoy this wonderful documentary. The PQ is great except a few scenes particulary the lifeguard competition which has grainy scenes. Overall the PQ looks stunning.

The only small problem is some of the extra features can't play properly with occasional freezing. If you're not into the extras then this will be a great disc. Highly recommended!",1179792000,4,453,5.121621621621622
2678780,5,B000JRYP0K,"This is an excellent example of HD video.  Crowe does a great job of narration.  Very informative and interesting HD DVD on Austrailia.  You need the 1.5 firmware if you have a Toshiba HD-XA2 player.  Sound is OK nothing over the top.  Crowe's voice comes through very clean through the center channel.  A little long, but still very interesting title.",1179100800,3,352,4.783333333333333
2678781,5,B000JRYP0K,"Like  virtually all of the Discover Channel productions this one is excellent. I have used it in my geography classes,  and shared it with the other Geography teachers in my school who also liked it. It transports the students to a place they would not otherwise see, and makes the material relevant. Better yet I even enjoyed it.

I still need to purchase the Brazil and Italy films in this series as well as the ""Great Wall of China"". I did purchase the China Film in this series and it is also excellent!",1178928000,11,507,4.43010752688172
2678782,1,B000JRYP0K,Do not buy this if you use Xbox 360 HD DVD drive. It does not work. Amazon don't tell you this and are misleading buyers.,1178409600,,121,3.88
2678783,5,B000JRYP0K,Tonight 4.15.2007 I installed the latest firmware from Toshiba and the Australia HD DVD is working for the first time.  I did the online update and I am not sure if it is the 1.3/T20 or the 1.5 which is on the Toshiba website.  Either way this firmware update was the trick.  Great timing because Planet Earth is out next week! My hardware - Toshiba HD-A2,1176595200,3,355,4.348484848484849
2678784,1,B000JRYP0K,"The Discovery Atlas serise is great, some of the best documentry content Discovery has made in years. Too bad I can't see it unless its in re-runs on Discovery Channel. This disk dosn't run on my 360 HD DVD drive which is the most recently built revision of the 360 HD DVD drive that was released only days ago. Whatever the problem wih this and the Italy Revealed disk it still isn't fixed in the latest hardware revision.",1176249600,,423,4.435897435897436

8152777,4,B000JRYP0K,"excellent service. I would have wanted more of Australia, different regions. I love Russell Crowe as the narrator, he has a beautiful speaking voice.",1403049600,,149,5.25
8152778,5,B000JRYP0K,"The presentation: Be prepared for 90+ minutes of HD ""Wow!""  Just the intro alone is enough to impress.  Russell Crowe's narrative voice floats from your center channel speaker like he is in the room with you, telling you - with pride - about his homeland.  Definitely HD/surround demo quality.  Also, check out the extra how-we-did-it short features included.  They are equally as good.
The content: Little is shown about the south, west, or north coasts, nor much of the interior of the country.
Be sure to check the running time so you get the full 90+ minute presentation, because there is an edited version that has been released.",1346284800,,634,4.833333333333333

8152782,4,B000JRYP0K,"I have always wanted to visit Australia and this is the next best thing. In fact for me it is the Best thing putting my age into consideration, as I felt like I was actually there. It is such a vast country one could never see it all by travel alone.
