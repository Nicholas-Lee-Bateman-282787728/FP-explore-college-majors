Unknown to either of us until she somehow came across it, the film is a marvel of purity & simplicity: two young nuns in Chicago, 1968, are invited by two young documentary filmmakers to ask strangers on  the street, ""Are you happy?"" The nuns are open, sincere & utterly without affectations of any kind ... and this undoubtedly helps those interviewed to respond with candor & considered thought. The unpretentious honesty of the situation leads to guileless honesty on the part of those interviewed.

As the previous reviewer noted, part of the film's appeal is its time capsule quality. This goes beyond the fashions & styles of 1968, I think, to the overall tone of the people themselves. This is prior to an era of glib irony & snark -- the people from all walks of life are genuinely concerned by the problems of their day, but equally hoping for some sort of unity & understanding among all of them. Some today might call this naivet ... but to me, it's simply an expression of basic human decency, a deep longing for greater communion with one another.

Interestingly, we don't hear anyone say that they'd be happier if they were rich. The real discussion of money is the knowledge that some are immensely rich, while others live in poverty -- the issue is disparity, not personal gain. Even more interestingly, many of those interviewed explain why they're happy by speaking of a sense of self-knowledge, of being true to themselves. Such were the priorities of so many people at that time, something we could use more of today.

The original film would be reason enough to own this DVD -- but there's more, including a follow-up interview with the two (now former) nuns in 2009, talking about the film & their lives since then; and a similar short film made by high school students who had seen the film in 2009. This cellphone-made documentary is lovely, because the people interviewed are very different from the shallow media stereotypes of young people today -- they're just as thoughtful & considered as their predecessors from 1968. This is heartening!

I'll be watching this film again, probably many times in the years to come. When my wife & I had finished watching it, we found ourselves talking about it at length. It would be perfect for sharing with a group of friends, as it would certainly lead to fascinating discussions. An unexpected treasure in every way -- most highly recommended!",1483920000,,2515,4.719817767653758

Skinny ties & fedoras & horn-rimmed glasses on the men. On the women, babushkas & no low-cut dresses. Yes it was a more formal time attire-wise those days, but to a person every single interviewee - white, black, man, woman, child - a dignity displayed and an clear-cut Americanism about them. Where did that country go? (And I don't care if anyone reading this comment calls me a xenophobe, go right ahead.)

This short - 60 minute - documentary has a disarming innocence about it and I don't think just because two nuns are its ""stars."" The sisters, armed with a microphone simply ask, ""Are you happy?"" to passers-by out & about various locales in Chicago - first in front of a cold & blustery neighborhood church letting out, then another church located under the elevated structure that defines Chicago's ""Loop"", the Chicago Art Institute, the Museum of Science & Industry, and finally, the entrance to a shopping center grocery store.

The answers they get back are remarkable - both for their candor & for their humanity. Caught off-guard, people seem surprisingly open and overall, thankful to say ... yes. Not all do and those seem even more human for admitting to it. To see them say so a confession that left me wanting the future - today - to have fulfilled their longing.

The grainy black & white lends to its seeming ""long ago""ness, and seeing the 1960s era boxy, bulky, automobiles & buses only reinforces a different era now quite far far away, as much figuratively as literally.

Inquiring Nuns begins and ends with the two sisters bunched together in the rear seat of a car being interviewed, as it rides along Lake Shore Drive, first heading toward downtown Chicago (the newly erected John Hancock building standing out in the distance, Sears Tower yet to steal its skyscraper crown) and as the film concludes, driving away from the city.

As the nuns ride home, you can almost sense the experience has forever changed them, and watching this documentary, sitting in a small library auditorium filled with people now senior citizens but in 1968, an almost half century younger, I could almost sense the same thing too, for us. This film certainly effected me.

Where does the time go? Am I happy? I don't know & I don't know; but I can say thankful for many things over the years - then til now -  including having seen this touching - and thought-provoking - film.",1474934400,,2449,4.67906976744186
