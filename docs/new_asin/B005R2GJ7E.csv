A few months later,US agent Whit Colbett(Dick Powell)is put on Reichers trail. Reicher was never photographed except for a badly taken picture of Hitler with his top SS men in a restraunt with Reichers back to the camera.
A ring that was once Reichers turns up in Greece and a cigarette case that belonged to him turns up in North China. Whit gets a lead when he finds many ex nazis are joining the Foreign Legion in Vietnam.
Reicher is signing into the legion,but wealthy exnazi,now working for the communists,Mark Van Ratten(Vincent Price)remembers Reicher when he had been in Berlin before the war. Mark sends Reicher to a plastic surgeon to have the SS mark taken off his arm. Reicher,then joins the legion.
Whit,who has no idea what Reicher looks like,also joins.
Whit meets French agent Lili (Marta Toren)and finds Mark Van Ratten is whos shes trailing when she finds hes selling guns to the reds.
Reicher finds that Heindorf has also joined the legion and Reicher warns him to keep quiet.
Whit gets another lead when he finds that Heindorf is in the Hitler picture and must know Reicher,but keeps quiet hoping he will lead him to the top exnazi.
My favorite Dick Powell film. Lots of action and suspense in this Noir thriller.
Carl Reicher is based on Martin Boarmann.
