2295565,5,B0009JQJRK,"All you people complaining have no idea man!! If your going to complain about anything, complain about not having a complete ""The Camera Eye"" recording at the beginning!! This is the best Rush concert footage ever recorded. I dream of going back in time to relive seeing them during that tour as well as the Signals tour the next year. I used to watch this at a friends house on LaserDisc and it was the same as presented here with the exception of the great 5.1 Dolby/DTS mixes. One hell of a cherished memory.",1431129600,,511,4.446808510638298

Of course, it's not going to be like an HD video because they didn't have that capability back then.  But if you've ever seen it, you'll know that it's well worth the purchase price.

2295570,5,B0009JQJRK,"A excellent concert of Rush in their prime. All your favorite songs by your favorite band. Can it get any better than that? Nope. This is their first concert released to DVD and at the perfect time. The set list includes songs mainly from their ""Moving Pictures"" album which they were touring in support for at this time. Geddy Lee can hit all the high notes with ease which is quite a contrast when you look at their recent stuff. This is the concert that started it all for me. Ever since this they play classics like ""YYZ"" and ""Limelight"" in all their shows. But in this you see them play ""Red Barchetta"" which is amazing! They also play stuff from their other older albums which you don't hear them play anymore in their new concerts which is cool. My favorite album is 2112 but Moving Pictures is a close second. Then again I enjoy all their early stuff from the 70's. So if you dig that early Rush sound, then get this baby, and it will give you much enjoyment for you and your friend for a long time!",1424649600,4,1007,4.3052631578947365
2295571,3,B0009JQJRK,"It old material, from around 1980, judging from their clothes.  Less than an hour long.  The video is not good.  The sound is not good.  But people are buying it because it is an official Rush release, and Rush released it long ago for VHS.  It only recently has been released for DVD.  But nothing has been added:  there are no bonus interviews or anything, or special features.",1423267200,,379,4.485294117647059
2295572,5,B0009JQJRK,"This is my favorite Rush album.  It contains all of the great stuff (except Cygnus) prior to Signals and to me, shows them at the pinnacle of their musicianship.  They have obviously matured over the years, but there is nothing like this version that shows their passion as the mighty musical triumphirate.",1421366400,,306,4.865384615384615

2295576,5,B0009JQJRK,"Yes sir. RUSH seen at their prime of their lives and the peak of their musical career. This was a great concert film to watch. But 60 minutes isn't long enough. I would sure love to see this performance shown in it's entirety and not just a mere 60 minutes of it. Anybody who loved Moving Pictures and the albums that came before it, I'm sure they would agree. I found a full set list of this show and I saw that plenty more songs were played. To look it up, type in Rush set list @ the Montreal Forum 1981, and you'll find it.",1405728000,,527,4.0285714285714285

2295579,5,B0009JQJRK,"When I was a teen, I had this video on VHS tape. The DVD brings back memories and it looks great on the big screen.  This band is timeless and will force you to relive your youth.",1399248000,,179,3.8378378378378377
2295580,5,B0009JQJRK,"This is exactly what it is.  They took the old VHS footage and put it on a DVD.  I wore out the old VHS copy and finally got the DVD.  I graduated from high school in 1984 and this takes me back to then!  The goofy visual effects and comments were part of the VHS and normal for that time period.  Those complain about it being on the DVD are entitled to your opinion but also, ""freedom of speech"" also means ""freedom to keep your mouth shut"".  If you like the DVD, remember the time period in which it was made.  If you don't like it, good for you.  Those of us who grew up with Rush remember it fondly, goofy visuals, comments, and all.",1398038400,,638,4.048

2295582,5,B0009JQJRK,"I admit, I haven't really been into the more recent Rush music, it strikes me as a bit stale and formulaic, and I wondered if maybe that perception is more due to my aging than Rush's.  Well, I decided to give this DVD a shot, and wow, this is the awesome Rush I remember!  The musicianship is virtuosic for all three of them, the songs are unlike anything any other band ever created or will create, and their youthful energy and power are palpable.  In short, this performance totally rocks!  If you were a Rush fan way back then, this DVD should bring back great memories; if Rush was before your time, check out this DVD and discover just how good we had it!",1386028800,3,662,4.314516129032258
2295583,5,B0009JQJRK,"I have always liked Rush, have not had the opportunity to see them live, this DVD replaces the VHS tape I had. Quality wise could be a little bit better, but it still sounds good enough and is nice to watch.",1385164800,,207,4.073170731707317
2295584,5,B0009JQJRK,"Rush rules my world!  To me, there is no better band ever!  I had the cd for the longest time and wanted to have the dvd as well.  I loved it!  Seeing the guys back then was just a treat!",1378598400,,187,3.6

2295586,5,B0009JQJRK,Moving Pictures was my first RUSH show.  This release is a great reminder of just how monumental RUSH was during the early 80's.  Highly recommend it to anyone looking to relive those wonderful performances or never saw them to begin with.,1360800000,,239,4.804878048780488
2295587,5,B0009JQJRK,I didn't hear the band Rush before until two years ago. I love the band. The band is awesome. It is different than other music I have been listen to. I will buy more music from Rush.,1357948800,,182,3.945945945945946
2295588,4,B0009JQJRK,"I had this video when I was 14...on Beat no less.  The video quality was lousy then and it still is...but who cares the music is awesome!  This trio deserves many more accolades than they have ever received.  Such gifted musicians they are.  I marvel at their skill and precision.  A must have for any Rush fan.  Geddy's vocals are spot on, Alex's guitar work is excellent....and of course the master - Mr. Peart is outstanding.",1357344000,4,428,4.565789473684211
2295589,5,B0009JQJRK,was always a fan of this item. I tell everyone I know about it so that they will buy it too!,1357171200,,92,3.4285714285714284
2295590,4,B0009JQJRK,Can someone please explain to me why Neil's drum solo is not on this DVD. The drum solo is on the VHS tape that I purchased in 1981. Also the clarity of the audio is not as precise on this DVD. Geddy's Rickenbacker bass (which he stopped using after the signals tour) should sound distinctly perfect and it doesn't on this DVD. Some RUSH fans would agree that EXIT STAGE LEFT is their best concert. The song selections are excellent. Does anyone out there know what I'm talking about? If anyone has a copy of this concert on DVD with the YYZ drum solo please contact me.,1340668800,,570,4.336448598130841
2295591,5,B0009JQJRK,"For me, I sometimes get in the mood for some 80's Rush; and when I do, I always wind up putting this album on. So it makes sense that at some point you have to watch it. It's a lot of fun matching up the visual with the audio. Just to see that level of musicianship and how these 3 guys come together on stage makes this worth it!",1318723200,,330,3.7971014492753623
2295592,4,B0009JQJRK,Great sound on DVD compared to the original VHS version. Too bad the video quality of the original taping of this concert wasn't in better shape when they finally transferred it onto DVD. I was also disappointed that they never played YYZ in its entirety when this was originally released on VHS and was hoping they would have rectified that on the DVD release. Still a timeless video and well worth getting.,1307664000,3,408,4.680555555555555
2295593,3,B0009JQJRK,"This is footage from a good concert - the video is not to bad for the era. The audio tracks were remixed for this release but are badly affected by the the loudness war disease that so much modern music suffers from. Gone is the snap and crack of Neil Pearts drums - instead it's a nonstop blast of all loud all the time - audience noise is loud, guitars are loud. Trouble is if everything else is as loud as can be the drums can no longer be louder like they're supposed to be. Audiophiles will be VERY disappointed. Unfortunately most of Rush's other live DVDs have the same problem. Maybe we should just get rid of drummers in rock - we cannot hear them much anyway after the blastering engineers are done doing their damage.",1255478400,2,728,4.321167883211679
2295594,3,B0009JQJRK,"I've been a longtime fan of Rush, and I think they put on a good show at their concerts.  So, it's always good to have video of Rush's performances.  This concert video has a good set of songs, including some from their then-recent Moving Pictures album (Limelight, Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, and YYZ), as well as some songs from their previous albums (The Trees, Xanadu, Freewill, Closer To The Heart, and more).

However, I am a little disappointed with a couple things:
- Some songs are incomplete or totally left out: I heard that their Exit Stage Left tour was the only tour during which they played ""The Camera Eye"" live.  However, that song does not appear in this video, except briefly when they play a small part of it in the background during the intro.  I also heard that Rush played Witch Hunt during this tour, but that song does not appear in this recording.  The video is only about an hour long; A DVD can certainly store more than that, and it would be nice to have the complete concert.
- There is commentary and edited visual effects intertwined with the video.  When most of the songs start up, there is a short voice-over commentary about the song that I find distracting.  Also, there are shots that include edited effects such as borders around the players, etc. that I think distracts from the concert feel.  When I watch a concert video, I prefer to see an unedited concert, as it happened, so I feel more like I'm actually there.

Despite the missing songs and added-in commentary and effects, it's still better to have something rather than nothing.  It's always great to see Rush in concert!",1249344000,7,1619,4.606271777003484
2295595,5,B0009JQJRK,"Before I knew who Rush was, a friend kept playing Exit Stage Left over and over on cassette.  After awhile, I had to have a copy.  This album is a classic of classic songs from Rush.  All the songs rock and Rush is one of the few bands whose songs sound good live - not like some kind of twisted, stream of consciousness, we've played these songs a hundred times and we are REALLY bored crap like many other bands do.  The breaks don't bother me either - what do you want, a track or two cut off to make room for another minute of clapping at the beginning/end of all the tracks?!?!  Great album from a great band!",1245974400,,614,4.126050420168068
2295596,2,B0009JQJRK,"while Rush are still legends and the music on this DVD is not bad, all of the high caliber songs that are responsible for their fame (yyz, tom sayer) are commentated over during the length of the song, and broken up into bits and pieces while the guitarist explains this and that about touring and playing music with the band rush, I bought this DVD for a 15 hour drive from California and it was almost too boring to watch the whole thing. I would say maybe if you had a different motive than entertainment in making this choice.... that it might be held to a different opinion.",1245110400,4,579,4.37037037037037
2295597,4,B0009JQJRK,"I bought this last year and I play it monthly.  It is old school and the footage shows it.  The quality of the recording is good for its time.  This does not compare to Snakes and Arrows, but its old school mind you.  I am glad that I found this and its excellent concert footage.  Two thumbs up!",1241308800,,296,4.0344827586206895
2295598,5,B0009JQJRK,Moving Pictures is one of the best Rush albums. To watch this excellent album played life is something you shouldn't miss. Just get it!!!,1239753600,,137,4.75
2295599,5,B0009JQJRK,"This DVD I've never seen before until I purchased it.  However, I do have the CD, which I've listened to many times.  Again, I hadn't listened to the CD for many years, and the chance to see the performances of the same songs I was familiar with was the main reason I bought the DVD.  A great concert by Rush, and this one brings back memories of my days in high school in the early '80s.  For any avid Rush fan, it is worth having.  This DVD also preserves a phase of Rush's history (and reminds me of my own life history also).",1238889600,,529,4.097087378640777
2295600,5,B0009JQJRK,"I first saw this concert video back in 1982 on a grainy, mono VHS tape and it blew me away.  Since then, I've also bought this on Laserdisc and while that did look better than the VHS, it still basically looked like crap.  Well, not anymore.  The remastered video here looks incredible and the sound, especially the DTS track, is astounding.  Alex Lifeson actually had a hand in the 5.1 mix and if you have your rear levels set just right, the DTS sound will blow you away.  And after all these years, the performance is still incredible.  I have to say that if anything, this video has only improved with age.  All three members of the band are absolutely at the top of their game here.  And because of the new 5.1 soundtrack, you can now actually hear what the hell the guys are saying on the voiceovers.  If you like this band, this is the only video you need.  It would have been nice to have some extras on here and its always bothered me that a complete YYZ wasn't originally included but don't let that stop you - this is an absolute must-have.",1232496000,,1051,4.316326530612245
2295601,4,B0009JQJRK,"There's nothing to say about this if you've ever heard the album and if you haven't why are you reading this?  This is simply the best example of Rush during these years which many consider their best.

The videos, although some times grainy because of the time period, is just fabulous.  The sound quality is top notch and you get to see what it was like to be there for this momentous album.

If you like Rush, buy this video.  You won't regret it.",1231718400,,450,4.309523809523809
2295602,5,B0009JQJRK,"Awesome DVD!  I've been a Rush fan for more than 20 years, and getting to see them play all instruments involved in the music was great.  One of their best performances.  I was lucky enough to see them on the Snakes and Arrows tour in April, 4/20/08, with my 17 year old daughter one week after her birthday,(I was 17 the first time I saw Rush in 86' and she wore my shirt from that concert.  It was a very special experience to share with her. She loves Rush as much as her parents do.  I know from this, her dad and I have raised her right!). By the way, Rush is one band in my nick name Pinkrush, one guess who the other band is.  This was my 6th time seeing Rush and I'm hoping for a 7th!  I LOVE RUSH!  Geddy, Eric, and Alex, you all are exceptional human beings.  Thank-you for all of your years of unbelievably talented music.  Keep on rockin'!  Get this, I have two children, one was born on the 21st and the other on the 12th of the months they were born in,(2112).  I'm not kidding, fate or what?  I love all of your albums, and 2112 was at the top of my list long before I became a mom.  RUSH is ROCK!",1231372800,,1112,3.9954545454545456
2295603,4,B0009JQJRK,"I have not always been a Rush fan. However I have really liked some of whats been released over the last few years.

 It's always nice to go back to yesteryear and see what made this power trio a great and well respected band.

 Exit Stage Left on dvd is a nice well done concert movie that is worth your hard earned bucks.

 It's funny I love their Live Rio dvd but the Cd was so bass heavey that it made my ears ring for days.

 The same thing applys here. The Cd - Album was remixed and the sound from it was not so good. The Dvd release redeams the album remaster by far.

Lets hope that more comes from a truly great power trio.

2295605,3,B0009JQJRK,"I never saw the VHS version of this concert.  I wore out a dozen ""Exit Stage Left"" cassettes and my CD still gets a lot of play.  Suffice it to say, ""I love the music from this tour.""  The video footage was well captured and well done all the way around.  No complaints there.  But every song is interrupted with commentary and goofy visual effects that have nothing to do with the concert.  For instance:

Geddy Lee on stage, ""This a song about a car, this is called Red Barchetta."" Then the audio and video are interrupted for some oration and a stupid, low quality visual.  Fellas, that is tripe.  Tripe.  I want to see the concert, please.  I want to listen to the music, please.  Spare me the gimmicks.  You are Rush.  You do not need this kind of garbage.  It detracts from the overall effect, which is to imagine yourself at the concert!  When the DVD was made, the corny crap should have been canned.  Most of the songs are corrupted in this manner.  Thank God nobody pulled these pranks on the music album!  Thank God.  I am so sick of concert DVD's that fall into this same category.  The only thing worse is the cursed ""change the camera angle every second"" effect.

Isn't anyone else interested in plain old concert footage?  Am I the only one?  I've been to hundreds of concerts.  Can you imagine it?  Geddy Lee in front of thousands of screaming fans, just beginning a song, then the lights and sound fade out, a voice comes over the P.A telling us what the song is about while some cheesy video footage is displayed.  There would be a riot.  People would trash the place.  Why do DVD's of concerts have to be different?  This is why I own very few concerts on DVD, and most of those have only been viewed once.",1217808000,38,1725,4.350157728706624

2295609,5,B0009JQJRK,"Does it really take 10000 phone calls to a record company until someone says, DUHH, maybe we should put this on DVD...  Anyway, the VHS show was great, so where is all the support for everyone who decided to get with the times and get a DVD player?  About 10 percent of those shows have been formatted for DVD, why are we still waiting?  Soon well be celebrating 60 years of Rock-N-Roll and the avg. lifespan isn't much more than that.",1134691200,8,435,4.345679012345679

So I'm ordering the DVD, as that old tape met some fate, where I lost it, whether by moving so many times, or someone stealing it...doesn't matter, I'm looking forward to getting the DVD version. All I can say is if you like or love Rush, you should get this, it is an incredible live experience. Not as good as seeing them in person, but the next best thing.",1523232000,,390,4.077922077922078
