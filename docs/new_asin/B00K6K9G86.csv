6403752,5,B00K6K9G86,"This is a 2014 BBC production in the same line as the Earth collection, for PBS Nature series. What a privilege it is to see wild animals undisturbed in their natural environments and no one accomplishes that like the crew of BBC and the talented, dedicated and educated David Attenborough. I wish David lots of health since he truly is indispensable. No better way of to watch a nature documentary other than having David as the narrator with his own unique accent and personality.

One of the best documentaries that I have seen recently.

I like frogs and I knew somethings about them such as the frozen frog (wood frog).

But I did not know about the poison dart frog, so astonishing!

6403782,5,B00K6K9G86,"Always excellent to view any of Sir David Attenborough's Documentaries as he narrates the many,many stories of life and land and ocean around us in this world of ours! As he talks about his many experiences during his many trips around the world to discover life, lands and oceans as experienced by all creatures on this Earth, I find myself mesmerized as i learn more about the Natural wonders of our world that exist in other countries. His long life of curiosity and wonder that resulted in a knowledge gained by actually traveling the world and bringing life to us as we view it in our comfortable homes is astounding. He brings the world to me and I appreciate him and his team so much! Thanks, Sir David Attenborough for too many blessings!",1435536000,4,746,4.616541353383458

Sir David features prominently in this film with him talking on camera, etc.  There is no chance that you could get a copy narrated by someone else (which is everyone's fear).",1418860800,,323,4.631578947368421
