8020290,5,B000228EA4,"This episode is a tour of the San Diego Zoo and it shows how the animals are cared for. It is a very enjoyable program for any animal lover or fan of the Nature series.  This is one of the few older episodes available with narration by George Page.  The animals featured include pandas, cheetahs, rhinos, gorillas, giraffes, and many more.  There are also two short videos on the DVD made by the staff of the zoo to educate the public.  One is about the polar bears and the other discusses marsupials-- mainly the koala. Polar bears and koalas are among the zoo's diverse exhibits of animals. The videos are good bonus features for an entertaining, appealing DVD.",1175904000,10,663,4.593220338983051
