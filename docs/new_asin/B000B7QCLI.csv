8083020,1,B000B7QCLI,"I originally purchased this movie with the intent of showing my students the horrible nature of Saddam Hussem, and the awful atrocities that he committed against the people of Iraq. On this front, the movie was successful.  Unfortunately, it quickly became a film to justify the American government's military actions in Iraq. The producer's argument, and a poor one at that, is that the military invasion into Iraq is indeed right, since Saddam was such a terrible man. For this reason, I will also use this film to reveal to my students the attempt of some real estate guy to promote his propaganda, and right wing agenda of defending Bush's miserable Middle East foreign policy.",1331337600,3,681,4.921739130434783
8083021,4,B000B7QCLI,"The origins of this film are strange and perhaps a bit misleading.  The man who hosts it is some real estate guy and you're thinking, ""Why do I care?"" But he became friends with the original creator Jano Rosebiani who went over and collected the footage and has made other documentaries about Saddam and Iraq.

I appreciate having something like this to balance things out.  The Michael Moore's out there would have you believing that Iraq was a happy-go-lucky candyland while Saddam was in power and the U.S. came in and burst their gumdrop bubble.  While it is important to have both views on the topic, I think Jano's footage speaks for itself as do the testimonies of the victims of Saddam's reign.

If you really want to call yourself informed and open-minded you should watch this film or one of Jano's other docs before really making up your mind on Iraq.",1219795200,,862,4.644736842105263
8083022,5,B000B7QCLI,"Watching this makes you really aware of the terribleness and evil of Saddam's Iraq. This will make you cry. It explains the origin of Iraq, how Saddam came to power, and what he did once he was in control. It also shows how Iraq has improved since the invasion what it has to say about the Bush Doctrine. You do not know the whole story about Iraq until you see this.",1143590400,3,367,4.183098591549296
