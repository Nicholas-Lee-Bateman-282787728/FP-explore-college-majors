8514049,3,B005LXUYTS,I was disappointed in this DVD box set. I was hoping there would be more footage of the Beatles. There was a lot of interviews with various members of the Quarrymen and John Lennon's sister. I kind of thought it dragged. I'm going to look for another DVD history of them. I just have a feeling there are better ones out there.,1274227200,20,326,4.274193548387097
