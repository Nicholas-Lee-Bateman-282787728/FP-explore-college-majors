8548770,5,B00A9XP2AQ,I love this dvd. It has gracefully widened my knowledge of the Saints and the missing Ark of the Covenant.,1525824000,,106,4.35
8548771,1,B00A9XP2AQ,"After 40 minutes, Disc one was so horribly scratched we could not view. We tried disc two and it was another scratched disc one! What we did see was great.  It certainly was not worth $18.20!

This was a Christmas Gift, and it wasn't opened until tonight, so it can't be returned.  I've contacted Amazon about a replacement for the defective Collector's Set but haven't heard back.  If you buy it, check both DVDs immediately just in case.",1485043200,,439,4.589743589743589
8548772,5,B00A9XP2AQ,Just enough information to inspire you to want to learn more. A good starter video in that respect! This is a video that I will watch and refer to again and again.,1395619200,,163,4.125
8548773,5,B00A9XP2AQ,"The description provided by Amazon (which is the description on the jewel case of the DVD) pretty much covers the gist of this 3 part documentary. I would like to comment on bits and pieces that I think is worth mentioning.

Originally produced in Italian, it provides a very comprehensive and detailed take on all three parts, supplying little known historical facts, and hence enhancing the viewing pleasure. It becomes both a medium for study and contemplation, while arousing healthy questions in the viewer, which it quickly answers.

What particularly stands out in the first documentary ""The secret of Bernadette"" is the nature of St. Bernadette Soubirous, her character and her native, down-to-earth common sense and the similarities to the other great French visionary St. Catherine Laboure. Certain details emerge from events in her her life that the viewer will find very interesting.

The second installment ""The Pope of Mercy""- the many clips from the vigil of Blessed Pope John Paul's death is very comforting; the history of the Vilnius image and its sojourn from being greatly venerated in Lithuania, and its disappearance during the Bolshevik rule and its return, as well as  the history of its artist, Eugeniusz Marcin Kazimirowski is noteworthy.

My favourite, by far is the third documentary ""The Lost Ark"", fascinating in its depiction of Coptic Orthodox Christianity in Ethiopia, the utter reverence shown tho the ark is of biblical proportions. Also the Role of our Blessed Lady the ever glorious Virgin Mary as intercessor and the fondness the Ethiopians have for her, and the theological link between the Biblical Ark of the Covenant and the Virgin Mary, is shared with the viewers, a context that is shared in the Catholic and Orthodox churches.

Contributing to these superb documentaries are Cardinal Ruini, Cardinal Shonborn, many learned academics and experts.

Unfortunately a major drawback are the voice-overs during the interviews. I'd rather they had subtitles instead! They even voiced-over the interviews of English speakers in English!(???)!

Each documentary is 50 minutes long in English, with no subtitles. And there are no special features or scene selections.

There is a second volume to this series which is linked here :<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Religious-Mysteries-Volume-Two/dp/B00GRHVHQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Religious Mysteries Volume Two</a>",1392076800,2,2442,5.614130434782608
8548774,5,B00A9XP2AQ,A look into the things not much discussed in this world--very valuable.  Highly recommended for the faithful and skeptics alike.,1366416000,,128,5.4
