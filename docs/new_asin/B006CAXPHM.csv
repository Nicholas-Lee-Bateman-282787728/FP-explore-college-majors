8496383,4,B006CAXPHM,"Echotone, which I first saw at a regional Film/Music Fest is the story of how becoming ""The Live Music Capital of the World"" has affected Austin, the Capital city of Texas. It's been making the film festival circuit and is making it's Philly debut at the F/M fest.

Becoming the ""biggest"" place for anything carries both the good and the bad as we hear from long time residents who have watched their taxes and cost of living go up, while the area's ""wide open spaces"" has shrunk. And we hear from the local musicians and those who are coming to Austin to seek their fame and fortune as singers, songwriters, or a combo of both. Director Nathan Christ has nicely edited this film and made the most of photographer Robert Garza's images of the building boom as well as the landscape and architecture that gave Austin it's image long before SXSW and ""Austin City Limits"" made it the Mecca it is now.

The music performed is by local musicians and reflects the old (""Americana"") and the new ""rock"" which has come in with the new music festivals. Austin is coping with its growing pains and, while this is a music-based film, it will also appeal to those interested in urban planning. (How many films about urban development have a soundtrack as cool as Echotone? None, that I know of!

I hope you found this review both informative and useful.
