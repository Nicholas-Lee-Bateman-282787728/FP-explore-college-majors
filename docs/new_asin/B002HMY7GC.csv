8370411,5,B002HMY7GC,Dolan is one to pay attention to on this subject. Listen close because many of the issues discussed apply to our society outside of the UFO issue!,1461110400,,146,4.444444444444445
8370412,3,B002HMY7GC,"This is basically a videotape of a presentation at a conference.  The info is a little dated, but the lecturer is obviously knowledgeable of his field and presented it well.  Don't expect a lot of video elements to be included in the presentation.  He makes a good point relevant to the title.",1428105600,,293,4.596153846153846
8370413,4,B002HMY7GC,"Great video for the most robust skeptics like myself. I only entertain the most verified and fact-based UFO information, and this documentary does actually cover some of these. I really only examine military, police, and air traffic controller-related reports, as I think these are the most reliable. I avoid the tin foil hat crowd like the plague, but some reports you just cannot ignore if you are at all open-minded. I am intelligence analyst by profession, so I don't take anything at face value, nor the ramblings of some ""abductee"" from a trailer park in West Virginia. Happily, this doco does not descend into the ridiculous, but really focuses on the aforementioned strongest evidentiary cases and the need for more government transparency on those cases.",1413504000,2,763,5.112
8370414,1,B002HMY7GC,"The person selling this is doing so illegally. He does not own the rights to it. He is currently trying to sell on his website, what appear to be homemade copies of presentation DVDs from many different researchers in this field. It is rumored he is currently under investigation for these practices. If you perform an internet search on his user name, you'll find many news articles warning about him.

This DVD was not produced and directed for TV, as the seller implies. Also, the copies were apparently homemade by the seller, which probably accounts for the HGTV segment that was found at the end of another DVD sold by this person.

If you want good information on UFOs, please search on the names of the researchers and go directly to them for information on purchasing books or DVDs. This will ensure that you get the best quality product and that you continue to support the work they do.",1252195200,2,897,4.635220125786163
