The music was soothing and picked up a little towards the end. This is great for relaxation. It was balanced, too. I think the previous really low ratings are unfair.",1460937600,,299,4.454545454545454
8245170,3,B0012DT24E,"Though not quite what I expected, it did help me while trying to improve the mood one night in a not very pleasant ambiance.

This is not a documentary, there is no narrative, the video quality seems to indicate the video footage was taken more than a few years ago. But it is peaceful and it does remind of other Japanese gardens one may have visited.",1452902400,,352,4.333333333333333
8245171,1,B0012DT24E,"I am trying not to tear this apart just because it is not my taste. The garden is Japanese inspired, with some features that may be included in some JP gardens. The music is not Japanese; the prominent instrument is not a koto",1432339200,,226,4.27906976744186
8245172,1,B0012DT24E,"This is nothing more than rather poor and amateurish videos, with insipid music.  There is no explanation of the scenes, etc.  I am glad I did not pay anything to watch this.  Love Amazon Prime so I can try stuff like this out and quit it when it is bad without having to pay anything.",1381968000,,285,4.1454545454545455
8245173,1,B0012DT24E,"This is a very poorly made dvd, not worth a cent of what it costs, the quality of the dvd is very poor, I will not purchase any dvd made by this company again and amazon should not carry this product. Signed Daunn Munn.",1347321600,,219,4.0
