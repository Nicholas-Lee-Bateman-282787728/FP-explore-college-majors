8405425,5,B003TRSJV8,"Winx Club Season 2 vol. 6 (2006 Italian release) Episode List:
S02E16: Hallowinx
S02E17: Twinning with the Witches
S02E18: In the Heart of Cloud Tower

It's just another original DVD release of Winx Club Season 2's Shadow Phoenix Saga, with only 3 episodes in both Italian and English. These Winx Club DVDs (from the 2000s) are great collectibles now, because they're out of print and have since been replaced by the 2010 rereleases (with new covers) and then the complete 2nd season (USA and PAL regions, 2014).

Let me remind you that there's no English angle footage on these releases because if you're watching the Italian or Rai English version, the Italian footage is the only angle during playback. Usually English episodes are English episodes regardless of format, especially when I've become loyal to buying Winx Club merchandise in recent years.",1432684800,,856,5.0638297872340425
