8235393,5,B000ZBEOEM,"Charm School is a 2007 Mexican foreign comedy directed by Fernado Sarinana and stars Mexican actresses Martha Higareda, Ximena Sarinana and Camila Sodi. In Charm School, Adela Leon(Higareda)is a teenage street punk girl from Mexico City, who is a constant embarrassment to her father, who is running for governor. So he sends Adela to a girls' finishing school in Acapulco and becomes a complete pain in the butt of the headmistress, but has befriended the other girls. There, Adela and the girls devise a plan to get even with her dad, and also finds time to have sex with the school's handsome groundskeeper. The DVD also has special features like four behind the scenes featurettes and a music video and a Spanish and French language track option. Charm School(a.k.a., Ninas Mal in Spanish)is a perfect film for fans of teen sex comedies and fans of Miss Higareda.",1385078400,,867,4.904761904761905
8235394,4,B000ZBEOEM,"I liked this movie and enjoyed it very much. It is one of those movies that doesn't require alot of thinking like trying to figure out a plot. There is lots of eye candy as it features several Mexican beauties, most notably Martha Higareda who plays the lead as the priveledged, tatooed rebel, Adela. She is the daughter of an aspiring for more clout Mexican politician. Mexican singer Ximena and daughter of the director Fernando Sabrinana plays a nice role as the gay in the group of rebel girls who meet while attending the boarding school to get some polish and take away the rough edges. Ximena pulls off this role very nicely with her adrogynous looks and playful attitude. She is always listening to  music on her headphones rather than paying attention so it's an ongoing gag that they have to tell her to listen up. The girls take nothing serious and are constanly poking fun at being proper. It is hilarious as is the movie throughout. Ximena surprises the other girls by revealing her sexuality when she tells her parents sent her to the school to ""fix"" her. Of course this opens the door for suttle messages regarding gender and equality. The movie is just slightly risque, by my standards anyway,with the occasional brief nudity,sexual situations and language. Bad girl Adela has the greatest line when asked by the prim and proper headmaster what she likes. Her reponse,"" Me gustan los girasoles,me gusta el color rosa, el vodka, la mota y el sexto oral."" Translation, I like sunflowers,the color rose,vodka, marijuana and oral sex. All the girls break up hysterically with Adela's disregard for being prim and proper. She is the ultimate wild child. The adventures of the girls at the boarding house creates for some rather funny moments.

Although the movie is billed as a comedy and rightly so it is also a drama; so I would call it a comedrama. There is  message to the movie, actually various messages. The end focuses on the different values between parents and their chilren's generations and how these issues are dealt with and ultimately solved for these young women who seemingly rebel and refuse to conform. I really enjoyed this lite fare of a movie and even though it was lite you can and should take something from this movie. The ""bad"" girls make this a delightful movie about Mexican upper-class adolescence and their conflicts and questioning of their parents values. Check it out if you want a fun movie. Recommended fo laughs and a peek, at times a satirical look, into Mexico's young upper crust.",1359072000,2,2530,4.784897025171625
8235395,3,B000ZBEOEM,"While I'm not partial to ""chick flicks"", Nias Mal is one of few teen angst movies that anyone can enjoy. While the ultimate lesson of Nias Mal (like Lindsay Lohan's Mean Girls) is to stay true to yourself, the movie is unfortunately weighed down with cliches. Too many aspects of the film are borrowed from similar movies, it only stands out thanks to the performances of a great cast.

The film stars Camila Sodhi (daughter of Mexican singer Thala), the very stunning Martha Higareda of Amar Te Duele, and songbird Ximena Sariana. Despite the fact that Sariana stands out as one of the most beautiful young actress of Mexico, I had mixed expectations of her performance considering she continued to find herself in movies (like this one) directed by her father (Fernando Sariana). I was ultimately happy with the job she did, and in the process became a big fan of her music, thanks to her contribution to the film's soundtrack (give her single ""La Tina"" a listen).

Nias Mal is a fun diversion, and while it noticeably recycles ideas from similar movies, it's worth checking out.",1263427200,,1081,4.775401069518717
8235396,5,B000ZBEOEM,"Although I would consider this a chick flick, the mexican type of humor allows this to be entertaing even for guys. The playful and sometimes even cheesy sexuality in the movie is not at all distasteful or unnecessary, but rather adds to the comedic sense of the film and gives it a sensual touch. Martha Higareda is a great and beautiful actress, and truly gives her character life as she portrays a young and rebelious senator's daughter, who is sent to an academy for ladies where she is to learn how to act like a proper woman in order to not ruin her father's campaign.  The movie has great music by Ximena Sariana, who also stars in this movie along with Rafael Sanchez Navarro, Blanca Guerra, Camila Sodi, and directed by Fernando Sariana. If you are a fan of mexican comedies, then this is definately one to watch.",1230249600,8,822,4.554054054054054
