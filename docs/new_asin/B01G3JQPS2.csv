8762193,1,B01G3JQPS2,I love the selections but two copies failed to get past the copyright notice. Then the TV screen goes blank and the Blu-ray player freezes its display forever and ever...,1485993600,,170,4.7
8762194,1,B01G3JQPS2,"Half of this DVD is devoted to interviews with the principal singers, so don't look for 140 minutes of arias.  Also, don't look for subtitles as promised because the only subtitles are used in those useless interviews when they speak other than English.  Finally, if you want to hear how opera was presented 20 or 25 years ago, this is your DVD.  Styles have changed a lot during that time.  If you need primers on the operas, the interviews will help there too.  Otherwise it is a waste of time and money.",1480118400,,506,4.456521739130435
8762195,1,B01G3JQPS2,The DVD was unreadable on my Sony Blueray nor on my computer. I order a second one and it was the same. I suspect that the disc is protected for USA only. I am living in Canada. I did apply the latest firmware on my reader and it didn't fix the problem.,1477699200,,253,3.8846153846153846
