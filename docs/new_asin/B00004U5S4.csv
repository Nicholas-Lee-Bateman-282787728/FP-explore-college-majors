7923617,1,B00004U5S4,THIS OUT OF PRINT DVD HAS BEEN REISSUED AS BEST OF THE BEAT CLUB VOLUME 2 IN 2006. THE BEAT CLUB VERSION IS ONLY MISSING THE HUMBLE PIE VIDEO FOR NATURAL BORN WOMAN AND IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE $25+ AMAZON SELLERS WANT FOR THIS. I PAID $6 FOR A SEALED COPY FROM AN AMAZON SELLER.
