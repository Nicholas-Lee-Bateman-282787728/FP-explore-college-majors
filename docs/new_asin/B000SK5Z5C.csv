I will add the warning each video shows a brief footage of the animal being hurt/chopped up/or killed by fisherman, natives or poachers to illustrate the need for education and conservation of the species to avoid it becoming extinct. This may be hard for kids to see, but the producers show the footage for informative reasons, not to vilify the people's interactions with the animals or to shock viewers with gore.
With this in mind, these videos are excellent for classrooms and for the avid fan of all types of sea creatures. They are 30-45 minutes at length and hold your attention with great footage and passionate people.
I found the videos to be very encouraging and do not leave the viewer with the since of doom that nothing can be done to save the species as some nature videos are known to do.
Highly recommended and the price makes it one of the best steals the internet currently has to offer.",1191196800,7,1110,4.697435897435898
