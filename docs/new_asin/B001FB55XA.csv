3571612,4,B001FB55XA,"This movie  is somewhere inbetween a comedy and drama. Robert de niro
is excellent as the producer who struggles to create profitable movies.
It details how the character deals with sometimes childish temperamental people who aren't rotten just spoiled. Although there is alot of stress in hollywood the rest of us are not allowed to get away with tantrums even if our lives are even ten times more stressful than the people out there. And noone is hollywood should be proud of drug abusing or take it lightly as this movie seems to do. One high point is that  Bruce willis creates a version of himself that is a egotist and selfish but in reality he hasn't been known for this kind of behaviour. This is much like the flick 'my name is bruce' featuring bruce campbell. The characters they play are NOT them, but they do use their names.  This isn't a laugh out loud comedy and when studios mislabel a flick it tends to aggravate some viewers. And this is A dark comedy.  This movie features a producers life which is a disaster and he is probably on the final downward success spiral that happens to most people in hollywood eventually. For some people all it takes is one flop and like John Hughes the great 1980's director it's all over with.  The blu ray transfer is excellent and the movie has alot of great actors in it.  It's not a great movie though and if you don't care about life in hollywood and watching supremely selfish people who put themselves first above everyone else , then you won't like this movie. However it does exist as a study of a man's life which is falling apart with some humerous elements.  De Niro's character is a failure as a husband , father  ,friend and towards the end even as a superproducer but one gets the sense that he will just deal with it and perhaps become a better man.",1235606400,,1817,4.468277945619335
3571613,2,B001FB55XA,"The misleading ad campaign for ""What Just Happened"" is a problem.  The trailers and blurbs promote it as a kind of laugh a minute comedy.  Aside from a few brief moments, it's not funny.  I understand satire and irony, but the marketing left me blindsided.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really work as a drama either because it's not very interesting. These are unhappy people - greedy, desperate, ego-driven, neurotic, and/or substance abusing. It's hard to become involved with the characters or care what happens to them.

This is an ""inside Hollywood"" story, adapted from the autobiography of producer, Art Linson.  It begins at a test screening of a new action movie, ""Fiercely.""  In the film-within-the-film, the bad guys shoot the protagonist (Sean Penn) and then they shoot his dog...in the head. The audience, which seems to have been making an effort to get into the film up to this point, is totally turned off by the dead dog scene.  The funniest thing in ""What Just Happened"" is the bit with comment cards filled in by the test audience, some illustrated with full page drawings of the finger and choice two word remarks indicating their displeasure.  (One wonders if these were actual comment cards turned in after a screening of ""What Just Happened."")

Robert DeNiro plays, Ben, a Hollywood producer struggling to save his current project so that the studio will allow it to be screened at Cannes.  The studio insists that the dead dog scene has got to go, which causes untold angst for the director.

Ben is also trying to get his next project underway, an action picture starring Bruce Willis.  Bruce shows up on the set overweight and with a full beard.  When Ben asks him to shave the beard for his role, Bruce throws a violent, screaming tantrum about violations of his ""artistic integrity"".  (Allegedly based on an experience Linson had with Alec Baldwin while filming ""The Edge."")

He is a desperate man, wandering through the movie with a bluetooth device that seems to be surgically attached to his ear as he attempts to resolve two seemingly ridiculous issues.  In between soothing overinflated egos, meeting with potential backers and negotiating with studio executives, we see vignettes of Ben interacting with three children he doesn't spend enough time with, an ex-wife, and a soon to be ex-wife for whom he still has feelings.  He's also feeling a little sad and nostalgic - for the houses.

The movie is probably pretty accurate regarding Hollywood industry details and lifestyles but, for the most part, this just comes across as whiny and grossly self indulgent.  I suspect this movie works best for those who work in the film industry, or those who just can't look away from a bad traffic accident.  I'm giving it one and a half stars only because the dog looked good on the red carpet in Cannes.

The DVD offers a choice of English audio tracks in either 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital.  Spanish subtitles are available. Special features include an audio commentary with Director/Producer, Barry Levinson and Writer/Producer, Art Linson; deleted scene; behind the scenes, casting sessions; ""making of...."" and ""no animals were harmed..."" .

Not recommended.",1235433600,6,3183,4.962264150943396
3571614,4,B001FB55XA,"Written by producer Art Linson (THE UNTOUCHABLES) and directed by Barry Levinson (WAG THE DOG), WHAT JUST HAPPENED is a dark comedy that takes a realistic look at the tenuous life of a Hollywood film producer.

Somebody once said that a producer will ""sell his soul"" in order to get his movie made, and this clever film seems be bear that premise out.

Robert DeNiro plays a ""powerful"" producer whose ""power"" is hanging by a slender thread.  Not only did his latest film have a disastrous test screening, but Bruce Willis (playing himself), the star of his next film, is refusing to shave his bushy beard for the movie, which might result in the entire project being cancelled.

Though he's dealing with three children from two ex-wives, one of which (Robin Wright Penn) he still loves, DeNiro's job is to juggle his personal and professional lives and keep everybody happy.  Studio head Catherine Keener insists that the recently previewed movie be re-cut, so the studio will only lose $15 million on it, instead of $25 million.  Now, DeNiro must coax his unstable director (Michael Wincott) into making the changes before the movie has its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.

He also has to deal with Bruce Willis' timid agent (John Turturro) and get the representative to force his client into shaving the beard.  Willis, incidentally, seems to be having a ball spoofing himself, particularly in a scene in which he destroys the costuming department while throwing a temper tantrum.

In his personal life, DeNiro discovers that Wright is sleeping with married writer Stanley Tucci, and that his teenage daughter had been having an affair with a much older agent who has just committed suicide.

I really enjoyed this smart, often laugh-out-loud, comedy, but the fact is that this film will probably appeal more to industry ""insiders,"" rather than the general public.  You really have to know the picture business in order to truly enjoy this movie's humor.

Sean Penn (as himself) and Kristen Stewart co-star.

3571616,4,B001FB55XA,"Film Producer Ben (Robert DeNiro) is having a bad week. His latest film, directed by a mercurial, temperamental, egotistical British director (Michael Wincott) and starring Sean Penn has a disastrous test screening. The next morning, Lou (Catherine Keener), the studio head, calls Ben and his director for a meeting. When the director throws a tantrum, Ben assures Lou they will make the requested changes in time for the Cannes Film Festival. His wife (Robin Wright Penn) is happy to continue going to a therapist, to help make it easier for them to break up. But Ben thinks she might be sleeping with a writer (Stanley Tucci) he knows. Then, Bruce Willis reports to work for Ben's next film overweight and wearing a beard he refuses to shave. Throw in Willis' scared agent (John Turturro) and you have an eclectic cast of characters.

Directed by Barry Levinson (""Wag The Dog"", ""Diner"", ""Babylon""), ""What Just Happened?"" written by producer Art Linson and based on a book he wrote, is very funny. But it is also way too 'inside' to make inroads to multiplexes across the country. I am pretty positive most people will end up seeing this film on DVD or cable. Most people aren't familiar with a lot of the inner workings of Hollywood. Most people won't like this film. Because they don't care.

If you have any connection to Hollywood, you will probably find ""Happened?"" to be as funny as I did.

Robert DeNiro and Barry Levinson have traveled this path before with the superior ""Wag The Dog"", a better, more insightful political satire that also starred Dustin Hoffman, among many others. I think the key difference between the two films is that ""Dog"" was a political satire, something everyone could care about. When Hollywood makes films about itself, they generally are received well in Los Angeles and New York, maybe San Francisco and Toronto. That's about it. That's about the extent of the audience for these films, the extent of the people who will care, understand and laugh at a film poking fun at Hollywood.

Hollywood is certainly an industry rife for ridicule, but most people simply want to go to a film and forget. They don't care about temperamental producers who struggle to hold on to their Vanity Fair power ranking, actor outbursts beyond the various tabloids and entertainment news programs, or studio bosses concerned about how a film plays in the flyover. The majority of the country is the ""flyover"", so why would they bother?

""What Just Happened?"" is based on a book by Art Linson, who writes about his own travails working in the industry. Linson is a respected producer and has made more than his share of good films, memorable films, so he clearly has insight into this industry. And this comes across throughout the film.

Ben attends a test screening of his new film, starring Sean Penn, in a suburb of Los Angeles. We see snippets of the film and get to watch the reactions of the people recruited for the screening. As the various people react poorly to the increasingly horrific film, Ben winces and tries to make the best of it. When he receives the response cards, he stashes them on the passenger seat of his luxury SUV and heads home, determined not to look at them. But his curiosity gets the better of him and he pulls over, leafing through the written reactions and threatening drawings. Both of these scenes are very funny, because they appear real. I have been to bad test screenings, I know people who hang on every word of the reactions of these recruited audiences. The situation is funny and true.

But does the public care? No. They simply want to see the next ""Iron Man"" or ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Tell No One"". They don't care about the inner workings of the machine creating these fantasies, these illusions.

As Ben rushes through his day, you get a picture that this powerful producer spends little time in the office. He travels from one meeting to the next, meets with both of his ex-wives, takes kids from both marriages to school, chats with associates and more. The Bluetooth in his ear isn't just an accessory. It is a necessity. He is always connected and when an Assistant tells him he has to go to the set, he rushes over.

Bruce Willis and Sean Penn both play themselves and seem to have fun poking fun at the very industry that keeps both very rich. Willis appears on set overweight, sporting a Grizzly Adams beard, both of which will do nothing for his image as the hero in Ben's new action film. Ben pleads with him and finally loses his temper. Willis throws some things around, scaring everyone and they come to an impasse. Penn appears in Ben's just completed film and the director stands by his guns, refusing to change anything, because Penn will be upset. He only agreed to be in the film because it was going to be edgy and controversial.

But Ben is, above all, a problem solver. When he recognizes Lou isn't going to budge, he realizes he has to talk the director into making the changes, to appease the studio boss and ensure his continued career. When a studio worker shows up to measure his office, an Assistant claims it is for the rug he requested, but Ben recognizes the signs and gets scared. Besides, he requested the rug more than nine months ago, so it seems suspicious that after a bad screening they are suddenly measuring his office for the new rug.

When he finally gets through to the temperamental director, he seems satisfied and reports to Lou who extends an invitation for Ben to accompany them to Cannes on the company plane. Of course, the trip doesn't go as planned.

These sequences help to paint an interesting, knowing portrait of the inner workings of Hollywood. Linson has clearly had or seen these types of problems and dealings and makes them believable for us. Ben's every minute seems to be a new choice, some of the choices he is able to make, others are made for him and he either has to accept them or attempt to change them. But with every minute comes the possibility that Ben's life could be changed for the better or the worse. Which might explain why he is always nervous and on edge.

The performances in ""Happened"" are good and add to the overall fabric of the story. But I have to ask again; will most people even care about this film? Will they flock to a theater to see it? Will they even enjoy it when they have the opportunity to watch it on DVD or cable? I don't think so. For this reason, ""Happened"" falls short of ""Wag The Dog"" and it's more universal message and story.",1226361600,10,6494,4.626736111111111
3571617,4,B001FB55XA,"Since most audiences are not part of the Hollywood system, it's difficult to say how effective ""What Just Happened"" really is. While it's generally entertaining as a brooding comedy, director Barry Levinson and writer Art Linson (who adapted his own novel) have made film that seems less like a satire and more like a commentary, painting a picture so unflattering that it's likely to frighten aspiring filmmakers. Those of us not in the film industry--myself included--essentially have to take their word for it, and I find that a little problematic. Still, I was intrigued by the story, despite the fact that it meandered a little too much. I also appreciated the film's sense of humor, with industry references that are nicely balanced between the obvious and the subtle. Finally, I was fascinated by Levinson's willingness to poke fun at the very system he's relied on for many years; he, of course, knows more about it than I do, meaning I have no reason to doubt his methods.

The plot is basically a series of interconnecting subplots, each revolving around a fading Hollywood producer named Ben (Robert De Niro), who's saddled with troubled film projects and a chaotic personal life. One of the subplots begins with Ben at a preview screening for a Sean Penn film called ""Fiercely."" It doesn't go very well; not only is the film too long, it also ends with a dog being shot in the head. The moody British director, Jeremy Brunell (Michael Wincott), defends his decision to include that final scene, claiming that the dog's death is artistic and appropriate given the context of the story. A studio chief working for Ben, Lou Tarnow (Catherine Keener), insists that the ending be changed: ""I've lost twenty-five million before,"" she muses, ""and I'll lose twenty-five million again. But if you change the ending, I'll probably lose ten to fifteen million less."" Ben goes along with it, knowing that a box office bomb will push him that much closer to the end of his career. Brunell's reaction to this is natural, if a little melodramatic. It will ultimately take a boatload of prescription pills and a break from sobriety for him to even consider reediting ""Fiercely.""

In another subplot, Ben is set to produce a new film starring Bruce Willis. But there's a problem: Willis has grown a beard, and he's put on some weight. He no longer looks like a leading man. This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on Ben, who knows that the picture will be shut down if Willis doesn't get back in shape. This in turn puts pressure on Willis' agent, Dick Bell (John Turturro), so fearful of his client that he often has severe stomach spasms. Rightly so--Willis is obstinate and downright hostile, pushing over wardrobe racks, knocking down tables, and pounding on doors at the slightest mention of his beard. I have no way of knowing how accurately this represents the real Bruce Willis, but I'll take it as an item of faith that he's playing a caricature of himself. I certainly hope this is the case; in the film, it eventually becomes clear that he's being difficult just for the sake of being difficult. There's really no point to what he's doing other than behaving like a prima donna.

The third subplot focuses on Ben's personal life, which involves two ex-wives, two young children, and an older daughter with problems most can't relate to. It's the weakest subplot because it's the least developed; we only meet his first ex-wife once, and her teenage daughter, Zoe (Kristen Stewart) appears so infrequently that I'm surprised she was included at all. Apparently, she had an encounter with an agent that committed suicide, which is a strange plot device in and of itself. We do, however, get a better idea of Ben's second wife, Kelly (Robin Wright Penn). Despite the fact that she and Ben are divorced, and despite the fact that they have unfinished business, they still have feelings for one another. Both immerse themselves in a special kind of couple's therapy, the kind that will hopefully allow them to separate as civilly as possible. But then Ben finds a man's sock under Kelly's bed, and he suspects it belongs to Scott Solomon (Stanley Tucci), who wrote the Bruce Willis film and is now working on a script that takes place in a flower shop. It seems it doesn't matter to Ben that he and Kelly are divorced; he still doesn't like the idea of her seeing another man.

Inevitably, there comes the climactic scene in which the final cut of ""Fiercely"" makes its debut at the Cannes Film Festival. Will Jeremy Brunell stick to his guns and release a sure-fire failure, or will he bow to the whims of powerful producers and release a blockbuster? I obviously can't answer that. I can say that the very idea plays into the notion that Hollywood is a shallow industry that cares more about money than it does about art. The joke, of course, comes from the fact that few will see art in a dog getting its brains blown out. Is there a message hiding somewhere in this? I'm really not sure. I've seen a lot of what Hollywood produces, but that doesn't mean I understand how the system works. Ultimately, I can only recommend ""What Just Happened"" for what it presents on the surface; it's occasionally funny, the performances were decent, and Linson's dialogue was clever. For those of us who aren't in show business, well, we can only hope that Levinson knew what he was doing by making this movie.",1224720000,5,5402,4.755863539445629
3571618,4,B001FB55XA,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Just-Happened/dp/B001FB55XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Just Happened?</a>&nbsp;is a new film based upon the half fiction and half auto-biographical book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Just-Happened-Bitter-Hollywood-Tales-from-the-Front-Line/dp/0802143385/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Just Happened?: Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line</a>, by legendary producer Art Linson.  It is a tongue-in cheek look at the film industry and the pathetic personal lives of the people in it.

And believe me, Ben's life is a mess.  Almost nobody he deals with seems likeable.  And his job appears to be based on manipulating creative people into destroying their most important work.  And that's just the good parts.  But lost in all of this is a sly and clever comedy that makes a lot of statements about the Hollywood system.  Yes, his life is a mess.  It's meant to be a mess.  You're not meant to like any of them.  After all, it's Hollywood.

Still, What Just Happened? is so subtle at times that it is just begging to be misunderstood.  For those who like dark humor, thought provoking subtext and exposes of the Hollywood system, this film fills a void that hasn't been breached since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hurlyburly/dp/0780626117/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hurlyburly</a>.

Robert De Niro plays his dead-pan, shoulder-shrugging heart out as a producer whose personal life is just as messed up as his work.  As Ben, he is perfectly cast.  Much of the plot revolves around his latest project, in which he has to juggle a prima-donna director, demanding studio heads and difficult actors.  But the real subtext is in seeing how he interacts with others, and all the little mind games he has to play just to make it through a day.  And when all that is over with, he is left very little time to try to piece together a very fragmented and sad personal life.

When his latest pre-release film, ""Fiercely,"" is test-screened, the audience reacts negatively to the *downer* ending.  Not only does the hero die, but a dog also meets his untimely demise.  But there is a catch.  The eccentric director insists on keeping that ending, saying that he seeks the powerful negativity of independent films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amores-Perros/dp/B00005N8A9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amores Perros</a>.  His anti-social and childish antics are amusing and pathetic all at once.  The studio won't cave, Ben has to be the bearer of bad news, and the end result is funny in all the wrong ways.

The cast of this movie is great, and it would take a lot to list them all.  The director is well-played by Michael Wincott. Bruce Willis has one of many cameos in a story partly based on the casting of ""The Edge,"" in which he refuses to shave off his beard. Sean Penn also has a cameo, and Robin Wright Penn has a great role as the ex-wife and simultaneous love interest of Ben's rival, played expertly by Stanley Tucci.  So as far as ensemble casts are concerned, this film is second to none.

The redemption in the movie is seeing all of the ways the various people cope with the business in all its grittiness and negativity.  And for those who are into this kind of dark humor, this movie has many subtle nuances to be studied and enjoyed.

Still, to be fair, some may be dissatisfied with this movie for a few key reasons.  Those who do not like picking apart subtext will have a hard time getting through the slow and grinding plot development, which is also done intentionally but will not appeal to casual moviegoers.  And the other side of that coin is, a movie that is designed to reveal the character's warts ends up with few, if any, likeable characters.

Despite these reservations, I appreciate the honest portrayal that this movie offers.  It doesn't dress up these people into heroes and villains.  It simply portrays their lives for what they are, giving us a glimpse into the industry they work in.

Definitely check this out if you are into the film industry and enjoy dark humor.  And please note, according to the credits, no animals were harmed in the filming of this movie, but several star egos probably were.

3571619,4,B001FB55XA,"Director Barry Levinson hasn't had much luck lately - after Bandits, which was a good though not anything very noteworthy comedy caper, he had two colossal duds in a row- Envy and Man of the Year- which, despite an otherwise impressive host of films (i.e. Diner, Rainman, Sleepers, even Toys) could have threatened to throw him off track ala Rob Reiner. But in a way What Just Happened was relatable for Levinson, despite it being the stories of Art Linson, semi-famous producer who's had hits and misses throughout his career, and at the same time gave him some ample material for some sardonic, spot-on satire of the industry. It's not the Player, don't get me wrong, but it gives its winks and nods to the egomania, the preciousness of directors and stars, and how personal lives get caught up in the mix without getting too smug with us common moviegoers.

Probably the funniest, as sort of a near running gag, is the latest film that producer Ben (De Niro) is being test-screened for audiences; a rough cut of ""Fiercly"" starring Sean Penn (who, as with Bruce Willis, plays ""Himself"" in the film) disturbs the audience because, on top of a bleak end for its hero, a dog is killed on screen (this, for all the wrong reasons, is hysterical funny, if only for the deadpan reaction from DeNiro to the insanely negative response cards). The director, however, a British hipster (brilliantly played by Michael Wincott), doesn't take it lightly that he doesn't have final cut. This brings around what seems like a moment of levity midway... and then back to the start when it comes time for Cannes. On top of this is Willis's 'plot-line' involving a beard he won't shave off. It's almost like a slight reprisal of his part in Four Rooms, only put to a much bigger, aggrandizing maximum. Both of these, much like seeing certain characters in a Christopher Guest movie, elicit laughs anytime they're on screen.

And the rest of the movie is... still very good. Aside from some scenes where Levinson decides to rush things along via the speedy transitions, he provides a style that suits the feel of the material, of Ben trying to balance his personal struggles (an ex-wife he can't totally let go of, and his rebellious teen daughter with a secret) with the eternal BS of getting work done in an industry concerned, a lot more often than not, with the final dollar over artistic integrity. It's not quite reality TV, but it has that unpredictable, on-the-fly hand-held feeling all the same, which is a method much more effective used here than in Man of the Year. And De Niro is also surprisingly good (maybe not a surprise to some, but considering some of his hit-or-miss turns in recent fare), as he doesn't lay too low-key in the part. One can probably see De Niro having studied producers - not just Linson himself but others- for long stretches to get the right steps for each deliberate step in ego-maniacal Hollywood.

So sit back, relax, and enjoy some near classic self-conscious satire on an industry that deserves anything those in it can dish back out.",1223683200,33,3059,4.724719101123595

3572081,4,B001FB55XA,"""What Just Happened?, directed by Wag the Dog's Barry Levinson, is a surprisingly funny and sharp-witted film that deals with a film executive producer and his trials and tribulations with a controversial filmmaker unwilling to cut a rather gruesome scene in a film, Bruce Willis having a ego-crisis with his beard, and the producer having to deal with his ex-wives.

The film acts quite spontaneous than how the premise may come across as. What makes it stand out is notably the way the film business works in a kind of satirical form that is surprisingly rendered realistic into fiction from Art Linson's memoir. Robert De Niro, while not as dynamic as in most films, gives a believable and confident performance as Ben (who is based off Linson) as well as John Turturro playing a nervous stomach-pains agent and Sean Penn acting in a brief cameo as the actor of the controversial film (which is my favourite part of the film due to its take on studio pressure and censorship).

It may not be rowdy hilarious or overtly crude for an R but it is certainly more intelligent than some might think and the beginning and ending sequences where he stands for a magazine showcasing Hollywood's top film producers is a vicious and somewhat depressing look at fame, money, and fortune (what your stance is in power) within the industry. Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, and probably Orson Welles would just find this film all the way a blast and I did too. Not much else happens aside from its already rudimentary yet integral layers but the music is upbeat (much better used than in Nobel Son) and the cinematography is realistic enough not to seem crummy.

Whatever your perspective is on film and film festival culture, What Just Happened? is a well-deserved treat and amidst its mixed-to-negative reviews and low-key status, remains to be one of the most humble, subdued, yet important films written about Hollywood I've seen so far. The special features, with one featurette including Art Linson discussing about his experience in the industry, is gold.",1377820800,,2047,4.893371757925072

3572087,5,B001FB55XA,"""What Just Happened"" (2008) is a good ""behind the scenes"" movie about Hollywood big shots.

I screened a used DVD of ""What Just Happened"" (2008) starring Robert DiNero last night alone in my living room in my Lancaster County PA apartment, and concluded it was a good, intelligent ""insider"" movie about ""behind the scenes life"" in Hollywood.

""What Just Happened"" (2009) stars and was produced (and probably mostly owned) by Robert DeNiro, directed by Barry Levinson, originally from Baltimore MD USA...my home town.... (directed WAG THE DOG with DeNiro, who likely also owned that movie, too).

Curious movie about two weeks in the work and personal life of a major Hollywood studio movie producer, prima donna movie stars and directors he has to coddle and coax, his two ex-wives and children from each he still visits and misses (wives and children), politics with studio big shots, his trip to Cannes Festival to show a controversial movie he produced, etc. etc.

The movie was made cheap (33 days, reported cost was $25 Million) with cameo roles by Sean Penn and others, but comes in a DVD package with two discs....a second ""bonus"" disc I haven't screened yet....what could be on that?

Story (WHAT JUST HAPPENED) is based on two movie producer memoir books written by a now aging (born in 1942) producer, Art Linson. who spent 30 years in Hollywood, was the producer of CARWASH (1970's?) cult movie starring Richard Pryor and others.

In 1995, Linson published his first book, A Pound of Flesh: Perilous Tales of How to Produce Movies in Hollywood. His second book, What Just Happened? Bitter Hollywood Tales From the Front Line, was published in 2002.

Linson states in the ""special features"" interview part of the ""What Just Happened"" DVID that he originally wrote a book of anecdotes he thought would make interesting and scandalous reading, and Robert DeNiro (interview provided with DVD...""Special Features"") read the book, asked the author to write a screenplay with DeNiro playing the aging producer dragging around baggage of two ex-wives and children from each (all still housed in big mansions the producer paid for....the wives got when divorces happened), wierdo Hollywood personalities including movie stars, agents, writers, VIP major studio execs who ride around in chartered jet planes, etc. etc.

""What Just Happened"" (2008) was one of many movies I screened recently about ""how movies are made, what goes on behind the scenes""

Other movies of the ""movie movies"" type screened recently for the first time include ""The Player"" (1992) directed by Robert Altman (MASH, NASHVILLE, etc.), ""The Stunt Man"" (1978) starring Peter O'Toole, and ""Wag The Dog"" (1997) starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert DiNiro (about a Hollywood producer who goes to Washington DC to help the US President, and is murdered by the people who hired him for his trouble!....""Nice guys finish last,"" eh?)

I also got ""White Hunter, Black Heart"" (1990) starring Clint Eastwood (about a John Huston type movie director making a movie in Africa and hunting big game on the side), and ""The Last Stunt Player"" (1993) starring ex-California Governor, Arnold Schwartzenegger before his Governor days.

Addional ""movies about the movies"" include: ""Sullivan's Travels"" (1941), ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1949), ""The Bad And The Beautiful"" (1953), ""Get Shorty"" (1995), ""Hollywoodland"" (2008), and ""Hollywood Hotel"" (1937).

I've already seen (often) ""The Last Command"" (1928), The Life And Death Of 9413: A Hollywood Extra"" (1927), ""A Star Is Born"" (both 1937 and 1954 versions), and ""Singin' In The Rain"" (1952). Also ""The Last Tycoon"" (1970's) starring young Robert DeNiro and Robert Mitchum.

There are many other similarly themed movies to see, no doubt.

So many movies, so little time!

I find these movies are very edgy and not a bit restful....just like Hollywood and just like the movie making biz I've been part of so long (BTW, I'm a SAG-AFTRA movie actor who started Hollywood paid actor work in 1970).

All very educational and cathartic....but not restful or edifying.

Back to better, classic movies for me after the current ""festival"" is over. (I'm like a retired sea captain or sailor who buys a cottage on a hillside overlooking the ocean, and stares out over it and remembers his days at sea.)

Many ""movies about the movies have been made over movie history including ""The Last Command"" (1928) starringh Emil Jannings and also starring William Powell, directed by Josef Von Sternberg, set in silent movie big studio Hollywood.

Many ""movie movies"" followed ""The Last Command"" (1928) quickly, including ""A Star Is Born"" (1937 and the Judy Garland version in 1954), ""Singin' In The Rain"" (1952), and many others, including important good movies never famous (e.g. ""The Life And Death Of 9413: A Hollywood Extra"" (1927) silent experimental movie by then young Greg Tolan, who went on to help film ""Citizen Kane"" (1941).

""The Life And Death Of 9413: A Hollywood Extra"" (1927) is one of several ""movies about the movies"" included in the Library Of Congress National Film Registry List.

Four of the movies on the list were stories about ""extras"" (background actors) who rose to movie stardom or died at the end of the movies (the two silent era movies had tragic ends about the ""extras"" starring in them, and the two sound era movies had happy endings....the ""extras"" became movie stars!).

I started work as a paid Hollywood movie actor 43 years ago (1970) and am now sort of retired.

I still work on major Hollywood studio movies shot ""on location"" on the East Coast of the USA, also major TV drama projects, when I get called, but mostly I'm retired these days, thankfully.

Much more restful life than I used to have when I worked full time as a movie actor.

I'm ""Threescore And Ten"" as the Bible calls age 70 (Psalms 90:10), and naval gazing about ""What's it all about?"" (or ""What was it all about?"")

I met many ""What Just Happened"" (2008) type movie producers during my Hollywood years (I lived there twice), and this good movie supplied me a lot of ""food for thought,"" part of my present ""Remembrance Of Things Past"" retirement life.

3572092,5,B001FB55XA,"This is a great movie showing the inside of the corrupt and really crazy world of Hollywood. Only De Niro could have made this movie. Nobody can touch him.

The movie follows a producer (Ben) during two weeks before the Cannes festival (we definitely need to pay attention what the Europeans say, because they are more ...distinguished and they definitely have more class than the poor slobs of Americans). He is really on the run and his families (yes he has more than one) are falling apart. He is trying to change the end of a movie that at first doesn't appear to connect with the audience selected to prescreen the movie (reminds me the worthless focus groups that the candidates are using during the elections). All these people participating in the focus groups that supposedly represent the average Joe are selected according to the same (Hollywood) criteria. Therefore they NEVER represent the average Joe. Because it is all about the money!

After seeing this movie I understand why movies like ""October Baby"", ""Touchback"", and the soon to come out ""Last Ounce of Courage"" among others, can only be purchased from WalMart and they are nowhere to be found on Amazon or on Best Buy. When you have a drug addict, degenerate director that insists that blowing the head of a dog is art, then you understand why these people have really short life span and they have to be medicated. Usually, what most directors of Hollywood regard as art and deep philosophy in their movie is usually pure garbage with the exception of few (i.e. Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, Francis Ford-Coppola, and Martin Scorsese among others). Because it is all about the money!

Then there is Bruce Willis and his beard as a side story. That is a great satire of the divas in Hollywood that have temper tantrums (Lohan, Hilton etc). Great parody. The scene when everybody waits for him and we see him sideways in the trailer is fantastic.  Because it is all about the money!

And finally, there is the therapist. In the movie they appear exactly like they are in real life...totally worthless! Because it is all about the money!

Make sure you watch the extras; there is more to the movie in the extras. Even Kristen Stewart looks good in this movie because ...she is playing herself.

Don't listen to the naysayers. Five stars all the way because of the cast and because it is REAL folks. I guess people who don't like the movie don't like what they see in the mirror. The truth hurts.",1348358400,,2480,4.700460829493087
3572093,5,B001FB55XA,"I was surprised at some of the negative reviews here about a film I've seen at least 20 times. Based upon Art Linson's autobiographical book of the same name, the movie does a great job of binding disparate chapters into a cohesive story that - while it's in no way fun or pleasant - paints a painfully accurate picture of an industry that's full of money and egos. While there are many industry films out there, What Just Happened reveals the money-focused obsession of studios, the narcissism of actors and the pathological dedication of semi-sane directors. And by the way, Michael Wincott's character here and his film 'Fiercely' is really supposed to be David Fincher's Fight Club.

While admittedly it's more accessible to movie bores like me, I think there's enough wit and cleverness in the script to keep the casual viewer engaged. Robert De Niro is excellent as the producer under fire and there's a fine supporting cast of the likes of Stanley Tucci and Sean Pean who play their respective roles perfectly. A tip of the hat goes to Bruce Willis for an excellent self parody as the actor who threatens an entire production because he won't shave his beard. And Catherine Keener is fantastic as the unflinching studio head who will take final cut from a director if the dollar signs add up.

As someone who has flirted with the entertainment industry on various occasions, the bizarre situations posed in the movie strike a chord and remind you that Hollywood is about 10% product and 90% money, power and egos. What Just Happened is clever, insightful and well scripted and certainly worthy of higher praise than it's been receiving.",1346803200,8,1643,4.822695035460993

You know if DeNiro, Levinson and Linson are all involved on a film, the odds are it'll be at least decent. Add Penn and Willis playing themselves to great satiric effect and a great turn from Michael Wincott and you've got a film, that despite its various failings, is still a solid test screening.

It's hard to not think of The Player while watching WJH, though this never gets to those heights (and depths...it's a much subtler skewering of Hollywood). Both films love to hate the film biz and its attendant phoniness, and DeNiro delivers a fine performance. Though it's almost too low-key at times, and I did get rather bored a few times in the middle when I'd think, ""Why do I care about this guy again?"" But his deadpan reactions bring some great comedy at times, so it's worth the occasional slog.

The audience hated the ending which showed a dog being shot. The movie studio execs wanted the ending changed so they wouldn't lose as much money.  The director of the film wouldn't cooperate and change it.

Other problems include, 2-ex wives & children. Both ex-wives live in large, expensive homes while Ben rents a small apartment.  Kelly, ex-wife #2, is sleeping with the producer's friend whose also a producer. An agent commits suicide and Ben finds out his daughter was sleeping with him.

We have seen many of them: ""Sunset Boulevard,"" ""The Player,"" and to a lesser degree, ""Tropic Thunder."" Based on the memoir by producer Art Linson, ""What Just Happened"" should offer an intriguing insight into the world of film-making. Well, that's what I thought.

I was wrong. Not that the film is bad. It is just ordinary, keeps telling the story we have heard before. ""What Just Happened"" stars Robert De Niro as Ben, a Hollywood producer, whose latest film starring Sean Penn (playing himself) has received overwhelming negative responses at the test screening. In addition, he is having trouble with Bruce Willis (playing himself) refusing to shave his thick beard, and also with his second wife Kelly (Robin Wright Penn). Isn't this a bit too familiar?

One of the most impressive things about ""Just What Happened"" is its star-studded cast including Stanley Tucci, John Turturro, Kristen Stewart, Catherine Keener, Moon Bloodgood and Michael Wincott. Acting is all excellent, and there are some very funny moments, the opening sequence describing the disastrous screening test, for instance.

But the entire film as a satire lacks the edge and freshness we expect from this kind of material.

What makes the movie worth watching are the performances including De Niro who is great, Michael Wincott and Sean Penn in a small role.  Bruce Willis is funny too, but the movie suffers from the same problem as ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.""

Instead of being an expose of how finicky Hollywood is to its directors, actors, and producers, the film wavers and becomes a random hodgepodge of triteness. The movie misses the mark by not allowing Ben to be a sympathetic character, one who shows true motivation or true spirit.

The only thing that really seems to ruffle Ben's 'feathers', is when he discovers that his ex-wife sleeps with one of his colleagues.

The movie does feature a talented cast, besides De Niro as Ben. There's Sean Penn, playing himself. John Tutturo plays Dick Bell, the manically insecure talent Agent. And there's Kristen Stewart as Zoe, the studio head who everybody fears, including Ben.

Though the rest of the cast shines, Bruce Willis gives an absurdly overblown performance. Bruce plays himself. And he reacts like a violent madman, when asked to shave off his beard for a movie. The viewer is supposed to believe that Willis would be so attached to his beard, that he'd tear apart a studio in anger, when asked to shave it off. Willis always has been a Neanderthal, both on and off-screen. But even his fans would find his performance here, too heavy-handed to tolerate.

The only real plot to this movie, seems to be how trite the movie business is these days. Don't know why the producers, would think that there's any real entertainment value in the film. Watching filthy rich Hollywood power-brokers kvetch about their 'troubles', just didn't make me sympathetic to their 'plight'.

For most us who have to live paycheck-to-paycheck, feeling sorry for any of the characters in What Just Happened, is too much to ask. The characters all made their own over-privileged 'beds', now let them lie in them.",1262044800,,1932,4.914110429447852
3572141,3,B001FB55XA,"While this movie falls a little short in sheer narrative pleasure, it's still fun to watch Sean Penn and Bruce Willis play themselves larger than life.

If you already feel jaded towards the Hollywood establishment, this film doesn't have a lot to teach you. But as a meditation on the performative, fraudulent nature of power, it's an interesting story. Depending on who he's talking to in the pecking order, De Niro's character--a producer slowly falling from grace--switches from despot to cowering lackey, and De Niro plays his part very well.

So well that it becomes hard to watch. You want the characters to just say something real... to connect like regular human beings.

Bruce Willis carries the show with over-the-top outbursts of drama-queen rage. I think someone would have to be a pretty nice guy in real life to be able to play themselves as such a jerk in a movie.

One oddity: Bruce has a eulogy that includes a quote about how ""Hollywood is a place where good men die like dogs."" In the DVD trailer, he attributes the quote to his father. In the movie he attributes it to Hunter S. Thompson.

Your job? Spread this net rumor: Hunter S. Thompson was Bruce Willis' father.",1257638400,,1188,4.719806763285024

3572143,5,B001FB55XA,"Wow.  If you only watched movies based on reviews, chances are you have spent a few months avoiding Barry Levinson's latest, WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

What are you missing?

- A great performance from Robert De Niro: That alone should make this movie worth watching for many people.  De Niro has been a bit hit-and-miss with his movie choices lately, but as Hollywood producer Ben, De Niro is simply terrific. In ways both obvious and subtle, he manages to convey many layers of emotion as his character tries to bridge the worlds of creativity and commerce--even as he tries to come to terms with all the compromises, mistakes and challenges that have left him with two ex-wives and a lot of bills to pay.  The fact that his two current projects are both collapsing around him only adds to the pressure. But, touchingly, the thing he seems to care most about is that his most recent wife (Robin Wright) is reupholstering his favorite (but no longer his) sofa.

- A great insider view of the movie industry:  Sure, it's been done before.  But I enjoyed this movie more than ""The Player"" and found it more compelling and fun than ""Entourage."".  Catherine Keener as the steely, numbers-oriented studio head?  Superb.  Michael Wincott as the British director who's both a recovering addict and an unyielding creative primadonna?  Nailed it.  Stanley Tucci as the screenwriter (and romantic rival) whose next movie is about a florist?  Fantastic.  John Turturro as the agent who's too scared to talk to his high-powered clients.  Hilarious.  Robin Wright Penn as the ex-wife who wants to move on but never can say goodbye?  Heart-achingly believable. Kristin Stewart as the angst-ridden teen who may have an inappropriate lover? You know she can play that role, ""Twilight"" fans!

- Funny, self-deprecating cameos by Bruce Willis and Sean Penn: These two guys really get into the spirit of the movie. Willis, especially, seems to thrive on playing ""Bruce Willis"" as a cocky method actor who is willing to put a whole movie at risk rather than shave the bushy beard he's grown as an ""artistic choice"" for his character.

This is a movie where you have to get over the fact that, when we get to the Cannes Film Festival, Robert De Niro is just a face in the crowd while ""Sean Penn"" is a real-world movie star. Plus the fact that Sean Penn's real-life wife is the fictional ex-wife of a character played by De Niro.  If you get to that point, though, you will probably be enjoying this movie as much as I did, and these things will barely register.

So ignore the reviews.  (Except this one)  Watch this movie with an open mind.  If nothing else, you'll end up appreciating how hard it is for Hollywood to create a movie that leaves you so thoroughly entertained.",1250294400,2,2750,4.726890756302521
3572144,3,B001FB55XA,"This film was worth a look but it's no ""Wag The Dog"" or ""The Player"". With this concept and this cast it should have been a classic movie.... but it ended up as only a lightweight unfortunately.",1246579200,,194,4.27027027027027

3572146,3,B001FB55XA,"What Just Happened? is a dark comedy about a Hollywood producer (Robert De Niro) who is in a deep rut. The film that he just finished (with Sean Penn) appears to be a bomb and the film that he is preparing to start is in big trouble because its star (Bruce Willis) is fat, bearded, and arrogant. On top of that, De Niro's personal life is falling apart.

The film has some funny scenes. This is Hollywood poking fun at itself. It reminded me a little bit of Get Shorty because that movie has a similar theme. As many reviewers pointed out, however, What Just Happened? doesn't seem all that fresh because there are many movies in which Hollywood makes fun of itself.

Another problem is that there are many, many ""loose threads"" at the end of this film. The film develops several storylines. One, De Niro's 17-year-old daughter supposedly had an affair with one of his friends. Two, De Niro is trying to work things out with his ex-wife. Three, Bruce Willis is represented by an agent who is so nervous from dealing with him that the agent has horrible stomach problems. Amazingly, none of these stories is brought to a decent conclusion.

What Just Happened? is OK. There are some good laughs. But it has several shortcomings.",1244592000,,1227,4.593607305936073
3572147,1,B001FB55XA,"In this so-called comedy, Robert DeNiro plays a producer who is having a bad day.

His ex-wives (both of them) live high on the hog in his ex-mansions while he makes do with a closest sized room full of plastic-wrapped furniture.  His next big project is about to go belly up because its star (Bruce Willis) refuses to shave.  And his therapist isn't helping matters any, either.

Yes, yes, yes.  Hollywood is a dark, soulless industry populated by manipulative, selfish, shallow individuals.  The film breaks no new ground, offers no clever insights, and doesn't even have the energy to be zany or delightful.  It's just a big, black blah that thinks it's being sardonic.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.",1243123200,,841,4.907801418439717

3572160,3,B001FB55XA,"""What Just Happened"" is an interesting and occasionally funny satire of Hollywood, but that's pretty much it.  The two main conflicts involve a dog killing and Bruce Willis's beard.  Most of the film is just Robert De Niro driving around town trying to resolve these two issues.  There is some meaningful drama between De Niro and his ex-wife, but it's underdeveloped.  I can't imagine *hating* this movie like others have, because there isn't much there to hate, and what's there is enjoyable, if not memorable.

Bottom line: Despite the cast, this is a very low-key film that succeeds in what little it's trying to do.  If you're curious about it, go see it.  If not, don't bother.

A test audience is actually watching the movie that Robert DeNiro's character has produced, and we have to watch them watch the movie. How boring. There is not one funny line in the movie despite the reviews on DVD case. If I wasn't watching with a group of people I would of turned it off before I fell asleep. I really didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. The only person who had a major role was DeNiro (and even he was boring) while everyone else had minimal roles. So when you see names like Sean Penn, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Willis you expect a pretty good movie, but if you blinked you'll miss'em in this one. A wretched film to say the least.

3572163,1,B001FB55XA,"This Hollywood satire misses out on the first rule of comedy - be FUNNY! Yeah, there are a few chuckles on occasion, but for the most part all the ""inside"" jokes just fall flat. There are some great send-ups of the film industry out there ('Get Shorty', 'State and Main', 'Living in Oblivion', and so many more). This is not one of those movies. Redeemed slightly by the ever-wonderful Catherine Keener. But Bruce Willis is terribly miscast, and even the usually stellar talents of John Turtturo, Sean Penn, and Robin Wright Penna all go for naught.",1238198400,2,549,4.729166666666667
3572164,3,B001FB55XA,"Skewering the out-of-control Hollywood movie-making machine is the focus of ""What Just Happened.""  Ben (Robert De Niro) is a successful movie producer just named to Vanity Fair's annual ""Power List.""  However, in one hectic week, his entire career crumbles around him as he deals with various Hollywood loons.  Specifically, the director of his last movie refuses to cut out a controversial scene, Bruce Willis refuses to shave off his bushy beard for a romantic leading role, and his ex-wife refuses to sleep with him.  Yep, he's getting a lot of refusals from the stubborn jackasses around him.  Of course, he's not exactly flexible himself.  Will he survive the week and make next year's ""Power List"" or will he be sidelined to producing straight-to-video flops?

Barry Levinson directed ""What Just Happened"" based on the book by producer Art Linson (""Fast Time at Ridgemont High,"" ""Into the Wild"").  Levinson is a terrific director, although it's been as least a decade since his last critically acclaimed hit - 1996's ""Wag the Dog.""  That movie was a pitch-perfect satire of the political system; I wish that Levinson had been as successful here.  There's nothing bad about ""What Just Happened.""  The acting from the stellar cast (De Niro, Catherine Keener, Sean Penn, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci, Robin Wright Penn, John Turturro) is very good, and the movie looks handsome.

The problem is that the movie feels dated.  If ""What Just Happened"" had been released in the 1970s, ""What Just Happened"" probably would have seemed fresher and perhaps even outrageous; it may have been hailed alongside ""Network"" as a classic satire depicting the outrageous excesses behind-the-scences in Hollywood.  However, in today's age, even the most casual movie fan is bombarded daily with stories of celebs behaving badly.  Anyone who has heard Christian Bale's youtube-broadcasted evisceration of a crewmember is likely to find ""What Just Happened"" rather tame.  The movie needed to be more over-the-top, or it could have benefited from more pathos - think ""The Bad and the Beautiful.""  Instead, the film ends up in no man's land - too serious to be funny and too funny to be serious.  I didn't dislike this film, and it was nice to see De Niro in an atypical role.  However, it wasn't entertaining or effective enough to add to the genre.",1237334400,,2330,5.0365535248041775
3572165,3,B001FB55XA,"""The dog needs to die"" that's all I pretty much heard all the time in this movie. This flick is really something, at times you laugh, and then at times you're completely bored. This is one of those movies that have A-list stars, decent budget, released theatrically...but it is quickly forgotten.

Robert De Niro stars as a producer who is having problems at home with his wife...or ex wife, they don't clarify that well. De Niro as always gives a good performance, but the plot is to hard to follow...even at times its just ludicrous and over the top satire. Anyway De Niro's Character is trying to save a film from becoming a box office disaster. It seems that the director doesn't want to change the ending involving a dog getting shot in the head! Yeah I know it's weird. Still the movie goes in circles with other subplots that are just fillers for the movie; they needed the fillers because the movie wasn't written well.

It's a shame because the movie's story had potential, but it wasn't handled right. Not to mention the irrelevant story of Bruce Willis playing himself and not wanting to shave his beard. Some moments however are handled neatly with humor and wit, but as I said it's just ""some"". The cast however managed to bring their all, even though the plot was not as great. I will admit that if Robert De Niro didn't Star in this movie, I would have not sat all 104 min of this mess. I don't recommend buying this movie, even if you're a De Niro or a Bruce Willis fan; which reminds me...all Bruce Willis does in the movie is throw tables around, act grumpy and swears...That's all. Just rent it, don't buy.
