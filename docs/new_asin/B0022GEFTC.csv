8349603,5,B0022GEFTC,"Fascinating reminder of how the country was sold the Iraq War, and how the media did little to question what was at best puffery and distortions. Dan rather acknowledges that the media dropped the ball in the patriotic fervor following September 11th.  A couple of Knight Ridder reporters who did raise significant questions at the time are highlighted in the film. The saddest moment might have been Colin Powell's famous speech, in which he laid out the apparent case for weapons of mass destruction and going to war. I'm sure he forever regrets that, since he seems a decent man. I'm guessing that Cheney, Perle, Kristol, Woolsey, and many of the other promoters don't have many sleepless nights. Another fine production from Bill Moyers (I can also recommend his Language of Life, and Florence dvds).

The title might lead to believe that this is about the economic interests of those supporting the war, but that's not the case.",1425686400,,933,4.89873417721519

8349605,5,B0022GEFTC,"This is my third viewing.

Although BUYING THE WAR was first broadcast 25 April 2007, Bill Moyers's Journal DVD of the same title remains required viewing.

Today nearly all but certified idiots must realize that The second Iraq War was based on lies generated and sustained by the Bush administration with the cooperation of our USA ""Lapdog"" media.

It's good to see SOME exceptions who ""dug behind the headlines"" such at Knight Ridder reporters. But unfortunately, usually such honest truth-seekers were defamed as unpatriotic - as were Phil Donahue and Bill Moyers. BUYING THE WAR features numerous interviews of those regretting giving Dick, George, Rummy and other ""chicken hawks"" a pass. For reasons best know to them, ""neocons"" such Richard Perl, Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld et al refused to be interviewed. Even so they retain responsibility for what's said and done. Lies do not improve with age. Let us seek the truth.

Brainwashing public about WMD fantasies extended to those who ""served"" in the Iraq War. Hard to believe - but surveys of soldiers sent to Iraq show majority actually believing Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11!! Many were motivated by misguided patriotism fueled by lies from Dick Cheney and Pentagon - knowing next to nothing about Iraq history, religion or culture. Lofty motives or high ideals were not universal motivators for ""service.""  Eg. Private Russell Baer was quoted as saying ""I wanted to shoot and blow things up.""

Being a Pentagon Pundit means never having to say you're sorry.  Seldom in history have so many members of the media been so wrong as in the lead up to Dick, George and Rummy's Iraq War. Similar ""experts"" continue their pontificating at the New York Times, Fox News and in much of simple-minded pop culture.

SERIOUS students of history should consider books and DVDs such as The Good Fight, A Pretext for War, Now They Tell Us, Lapdogs, War Made Easy, and The Most Dangerous Man in America.

8349606,5,B0022GEFTC,"A lot of the basic things I already knew [I read and do not listen to pundits], but the depth of some of this was well done and provided perspectives and analysis of the main issues.  It is a solid probe of the strangeness leading to the US invasion of Iraq, something General Schwarzkopf was discussing on talk shows before the ""war"" but who disappeared from the Washington circuit immediately after.",1372723200,3,401,4.647887323943662
8349607,4,B0022GEFTC,"I've watched this twice now, once to preview it, and once in a class I teach.  There are things I liked about it, which got better on second viewing.  There are things I didn't like, which got worse on second viewing.  The good includes its thoroughness and exhaustive documentation of a series of events that should disturb all citizens -- the deliberate use of distortion, omission, and lying by the leaders of our government to sell a military adventure of epically bad proportions.  The not-so-good is that it kinda beats up the viewer with a relentless hammering home of the point.  This would've been much better as a one-hour program.  Forced to fill a 90-minute time slot, it is overkill.  And as such, I think most of my class zoned out at about the 60-minute point.  That said, I'd still recommend it.",1360022400,,811,4.661971830985915
8349608,5,B0022GEFTC,"While the only other review gave ""Buying the War"" one star and called it ""Bush bashing,"" I found this video to be informative and objective. At first I, too, was taken aback by Bill Moyers opening statement since it didn't hedge the way reporters usually do. But, when the evidence shows that we were told outright lies, are ""unbiased"" statements appropriate? Unfortunately, this selling of war to the American public on false pretenses is not new.

The Spanish probably did not sink the USS Maine in Havana harbor in 1898. What would have been their motivation? Yet ""Remember the Maine"" propelled us to war.

It is now known that the Gulf of Tonkin Incident that Lyndon Johnson used as the legal basis for his Viet Nam buildup never happened.

And, in 1961, in Operation Northwoods, all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had signed off on a plan for a Remember-the-Maine-type-incident to create public support for an invasion of Castro's Cuba. Among other options, the plan suggested that ""We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba.""

Unfortunately, Nazi war criminal Hermann Gring hit the nail on the head when he said, ""Of course the people don't want war. ... But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. ... Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger. It works the same way in any country.""",1286582400,10,1705,4.6544850498338874
