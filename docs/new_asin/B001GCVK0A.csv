3603514,5,B001GCVK0A,"This movie includes dramatic, real footage and photos about the man (Robert Oppenheimer) that developed and then tried to put a stop to the atomic bomb. The movie focuses on the development of the opera which is about the creation and effects of the bomb. This movie is really a very valuable documentary of the events surrounding the development of nuclear weapons.

I didn't think I would be interested about the development of the opera since I have never been an opera lover, but it was actually interesting especially listening to Peter Sellars and the lovely voices of the performers.

This movie is so interesting and is especially apropos in our current global war crisis. I highly recommend for family and educational viewing.

3603515,5,B001GCVK0A,"""Wonders are Many"" is a fascinating film about the making of  ""Dr. Atomic"", a 2005 opera by composer John Adams. The opera focuses on the complex and genius physicist, Robert Oppenheimer and his orchestration of the building of the atomic bomb. The opera specifically concentrates on the last 24 hours leading up to the actual detonation of the first test bomb at the ""Trinity"", Los Alamos, New Mexico in 1945. The film not only depicts the actual processes of the production, but also interweaves much historical, scientific, ethical and even poetic aspects of this crucial moment in time. This film, just as in the opera itself, begins and end with the heightened tension of ticking---the countdown to the Zero Hour.

I found this film to be very exciting, even though I have not yet had a chance to view the film of the Opera.  History, art, physics and moral questions are beautifully interwoven in a way that helps the viewer not only learn many interesting facts, but provides much food for thought. ""Wonders are Many"" is a wonderfully creative treatment of a time period which we ""all know about but don't really know"". Although it happened over 60 years ago, this event holds urgent currency in modern time. War  and destruction continue to rage in our world today, despite Oppenheimer's hope and belief that his creation would lead to a ""war to end all wars"".

Bravo to all involved for the powerful opera, ""Dr. Atomic"" and this fascinating film, ""Wonders are all Around.""  I count down the time until I get to own and view the DVD of the opera.",1224547200,8,1554,4.737037037037037
3603576,4,B001GCVK0A,"When you walk into Wonders are Many, you are walking into an explosion of drama and documentary about the creating of Doctor Atomic, an opera which visualizes and personifies the atomic bomb and its creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film really speculates from two points of view, the historical angle in which we see learn about the individual Oppenheimer amid visual explosions, and the present-day ""making of"" the opera, which focuses on commentary and behind-the-scenes with composer John Adams and director Peter Sellars.

  What's evident from the get-go is the passion with which this docudrama was compiled. One would think it to be a challenge to pull off a film about a historical event and an opera; however, Jon Else, is able to, as we are treated to Sellars' insight as he leads his cast of performers amid the background of the San Francisco Opera. Sellars wants his opera to ""come alive,"" the events to take on such life that the performers are visual representations of the emotion and power. There is a smooth transition from behind the scenes to background about Dr. Atomic, Oppenheimer.

  Overall, a very interesting film that is visually stunning and unique.",1227830400,3,1181,5.0
3603577,4,B001GCVK0A,"This is a chilling documentary of the making of the opera 'Doctor Atomic'. You follow the drama of the creative work while re-visiting the scientific, historic events that led to the dropping of the Atomic bomb and a glimpse at the men who helped make it happen. Interesting and sad at the same time. I would like to see the on stage Opera. John Adams and Peter Sellars clearly put a lot of thought and work into the dramatic performance that documents a frenetic time in the nation's past.

3603578,5,B001GCVK0A,"Wonders Are Many is an intense movie that manages to shift back and forth between two fascinating documentaries resulting in one greater documentary.

One documentary describes how the opera Doctor Atomic, an opera about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the first atomic bomb, was created. Viewers get to hear composer John Adams and director Peters Sellers explain how and why this Opera came to be, get to see performers and crew add to the final product (including crew members creating props) and get to watch rehearsals leading up to the final production.

Intertwined with this documentary is another focusing on Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb which includes interviews made by Oppenheimer and those who knew him, footage of atomic bomb explosions, information World War II leading up to the decision to drop the atom bombs (such as fighting in Okinawa, casualty results etc.) and results of atomic bomb explosions such as radiation remnants and the remains of a government ""ghost town"" created to see how buildings and even stocks and bonds would hold up during an atomic bomb explosion. The documentary is even handed and should appeal to those who feel the atomic bombs should never have been dropped as well as those who feel America had no choice considering the cost in lives of an invasion.

What makes this movie so good is the way the film combines both documentaries, easily slipping back and forth between both to enable to viewer to see how the events inspired the composer and director and at the same time enabling the viewer to see so clearly how the opera addresses Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb.

I am forever watching documentaries on history and specifically World War II. The part of the film dealing with World War Two and the atomic bomb was very well done.

More importantly, if this dvd was just about the making of the opera I would not have gotten it because I am not a big fan of opera. This dvd allowed me to understanding and appreciate the creative process leading to the creation of an opera as well as aspects of opera I never imagined. It was very well done.

Combining the documentaries into one film was risky but works very well. The editors of the film did s superb job and created something special.

Wonders Are Many is a worthy addition to any film library.",1226275200,3,2347,4.7518427518427515
3603579,5,B001GCVK0A,"I was surprised at how riveting this documentary was. I wasn't familiar with Peter Sellars' work before this, and I was so impressed with his creativity and sensitivity to the nuances of the history and the opera, Dr. Atomic, that seeks to capture its lingering, terrible profundity. (And what an interesting character Sellars is! Even his hair ""do"" suggests how hair-raising a moment it was when that first bomb went off.)

I couldn't resist thinking that the real Oppenheimer looked like Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, dreamy and sweet and shocking and scary at the same time; that association cast the whole documentary in an almost trippish light for me; and the whole Los Alamos nuclear experience WAS very much like a ""seeing God"" acid trip, replete with inspirations and depletions and bizarre too-present flashbacks that persist to this very day. I think Sellars and Adams nailed it: One trip and the human race would never be the same.

I couldn't take my eyes off this brilliant blast of a documentary. Now I MUST have Dr. Atomic for my DVD collection!",1226102400,4,1058,4.872222222222222
3603580,3,B001GCVK0A,"This unusual documentary is actually two documentaries in one. Arguably, the main focus is a ""making of"" chronicle concerning an opera entitled DOCTOR ATOMIC, the very unlikely subject of which is physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb. Composer John Adams and director Peter Sellars get the lion's share of the attention here. We also see rehearsals, construction of the huge atomic bomb prop, and comments from some of the cast and behind-the-scenes personnel. What we don't see very much is the actual performance of DOCTOR ATOMIC, which would appear to be very offbeat and artsy, with impressive music. The sum total of this portion of WONDERS ARE MANY reminds one strongly of such supplementary features as are commonly included as Special Features on movie DVDs...fairly interesting, but one is left wanting a bit more.

The second, better portion uses PBS-style documentary techniques to tell the actual historical story upon which DOCTOR ATOMIC is based. Included is ""recently declassified"" footage from the 1940s, some of which is quite gruesome: one sequence shows farm animals being blown away in a bomb test, and there are shots of incinerated corpses, presumably from the Hiroshima and/or Nagasaki attacks. Beware if you run this with children around. Oppenheimer is seen in interview footage, as are some other participants, but still photos are also used a lot. The Los Alamos story deserves the full treatment, but, again, it's inadequately told here.

These two different documentaries are not separately presented, but intertwined as one; personally, I would rather have seen them separated and expanded upon. To me, that approach would have been more satisfying, but, as is, WONDERS ARE MANY at least attempts something a bit different. As to the actual DVD disc, it is manufactured on demand from DVD-R media rather than conventionally pressed. There is no menu at all. Picture quality is fine, though the full-frame treatment of my review copy renders the names of interviewees unreadable; it is hoped that the genuine article will be in the proper screen ratio.

Bottom Line: WONDERS ARE MANY is certainly not without interest, but it just as certainly could (and should) have been better.",1225756800,,2243,5.19060773480663
3603581,4,B001GCVK0A,"Nuclear weapons and opera.....one would probably think this an unlikely marriage and for certain, many people would say ""Those two topics don't interest me, so why would I watch a documentary about such an opera?""  That's somewhat how I felt, yet this does turn out to be interesting viewing.  If you don't like documentaries a la ""The History Channel"" type DVDs, you probably won't like this movie. The opera, named Doctor Atomic, is about Robert Oppenheimer and the invention of nuclear bombs....the DVD is not the opera itself, but a documentary.  There is a decent portion of opera in it, but at heart it is a documentary.  The movie runs about an hour and a half.  I think the balance was right for me.....any more opera and I might have lost interest, but then I'm not an opera buff.

The opera, hence this documentary, covers the Manhattan Project, focusing on the final days leading up to the detonation of a nuclear bomb in New Mexico in 1945.

I found it enlightening, as it was an interesting and informative story that gives you a ""behinds the scenes"" look at the making of this opera, but in the end is really much more than that, providing an education on the development of the nuclear bomb.

Not being an opera buff, I cannot comment on the operatic portions other to say they were pleasant and would not deter me from watching the DVD again.  All in all, interesting viewing and certainly educational.",1225756800,,1418,4.662650602409639
3603582,5,B001GCVK0A,"Since this is a documentary fo the opera, ""Doctor Atomic"", I feel I should concentrate on the merits of this aspect of the work.  It is a beautifully done documentary with lots of rehearsal footage and interviews with all the artists involved.  There is even a good dose of background material covered on all aspects of the history of the time, as well as historic interviews with Dr. Oppenheimer, himself.  The image and sound are also perfect.  So, if you are really interested in ""Doctor Atomic"", you will find this very interesting.  Prior to seeing this, I had heard of ""Doctor Atomic"", but had not seen it.  Now I believe it should stay that way!(I find the music insipid and the dialogue forced.)",1225324800,,703,4.67479674796748
3603583,5,B001GCVK0A,"Continuing in my current obsession with John Adams' new opera, ""Doctor Atomic"" I recently learned of a documentary filmed at the time the opera was being created in San Francisco. Of course, I had to have it. Now I do.

What a fascinating film this is. It comes at you from two interesting perspectives as both historical documentary and a major art project. In easily digestable format director Jon Else combines interviews, rehearsal footage and commentary by the cast and creators of Doctor Atomic - weaving in the story of the development of the atom bomb and the Manhattan Project. All of it is narrated by the mellow voice of Eric Owens, the baritone who has sung (I beleive) every performance of the role of General Groves.

The marriage of these two stories into a cohesive whole works wonders itself, as a perfect balance is struck between following the creation of a new opera and the history of nuclear physics involved in creating the bomb. For those whom this sounds bizarre, to say the least, let me say, I can't think of anyone who's interest would not be held - or even riveted by the manner in which its done.

There is fascinating interview footage with Oppenheimer himself, disturbing shots and clips of bombs testings (not easy to watch) and one truly gets a sense of the project as well as a sense of the bizarre community that occupied Trinity. It was interesting as well to see and hear the singers approaching their music in the first rehearsals, taking suggestions from the composer who was still very much working on the piece, changing things as they went along. Peter Sellars can bother some folk, but his infectiousness and thoughtfulness clearly command the respect of all of his cast members, as well as the composer himself.

Especially moving for me was seeing Finley rehearsing his big first act aria for the first time . . . this piece simply destroying me every time. To hear his own connection with it, how he wishes it had been something he had actually written, speaks volumes about his identification with the piece. It's overwhelming.

It is unnerving watching film clips of bombs 60 years ago - then seeing life- sized props being brought into the War Memorial Opera House (the name of the building really taking an unusually strong symbolism here).

There was some REAL backstage drama which I remembered reading about when it happened, but since forgotten (til now, of course!). Tom Randle - a favorite of many of ours - and portraying Robert Wilson in the opera was let go a little more than a week before opening night, replaced by his understudy, Thomas Glenn. The scene of Randle reading the announcement is one of those horrifying things every performer dreads.

I can't stress enough how unusual a movie this is - very powerful on all accounts. If I've a gripe it's only a wish for some extras, deleted scenes, photo galleries, more bio material, etc. Other than that, it's one amazing movie.",1225065600,5,2942,4.74559686888454

The other reviewers, Vine Reviewers all, must be all opera buffs, because they're all pretty much enthralled with Doctor Atomic. That's cool, it takes all kinds. I'm the other kind.

So this's just a plebeian review. Wonders Are Many is a documentary about a pair of theatrical pros making an opera about making an atomic bomb, the original bomb that debuted in 1945. The pros: John Adams, the composer ( Nixon in China; heard it; for me, incomprehensible ) and Peter Sellars, a very talented, hyper gnome with a brush-cut who directs and maybe wrote that 'love-tickled brain' line above. Amazing, watching him direct his chorus, making scary decisions which work out wonderfully.
(Replacing a key singer a week before opening night; very scary.)

WAM happily isn't incomprehensible. It's dramatic and multi-layered, interestingly paralleling bomb and opera building. It seems like both endeavors are equally complex and open-ended. Neither scientists or impresarios really knew if they could pull it off. Happily, again, they both did. ( Well, maybe the bomb wasn't such a happy creation. )

Gleaning scenario, staging, music and lyrics from scientists' comments, memos and technical books maybe is more complex than was building a big ball that went boom and still scares people 60-some years later. For us civilian viewers, WAM is dynamic way of depicting scientific creativity while dramatically showing the similar agonies of creating a complex, modern work of art. Cutting back and forth, maybe the message is that whatever the discipline, creation is creation is creativity in action. And it's hard.

( Coincidentally, I'm just reading THE BLACKWINGED NIGHT,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blackwinged-Night-Creativity-in-Nature-and-Mind/dp/0738204919/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blackwinged Night: Creativity in Nature and Mind</a>, which expands on the innate creativity in us all. )

If you're interested in creativity in any of its many guises, Wonders Are Many is well-worth experiencing, thanks to the talents of Adams, Sellars and, oh yes, WAM writer, producer and director, Jon Else (applause).",1224892800,,3142,6.2091954022988505
3603585,5,B001GCVK0A,"This was a very interesting look at the creation of what I think was quite an unusual idea for an opera created by two very talented men.  I must say that the libretto is one of the strangest I can imagine.

Here's an excerpt from the libretto:

We surround the plutonium core
from thirty two points
spaced equally around its surface
the thirty two points
are the centers of the
twenty triangular faces
of an isosahedron
interwoven with the
twelve pentaganol faces
of a dodecahedron
We squeeze the sphere
bring the atoms closer
until the subcritical mass
goes supercritical

Certainly an ambitious idea for an opera.

There is no doubt that the authors researched the subject matter very thoroughly and did a fine job with it, but I am still not sure about the operatic application.  I suppose I would need to actually hear the entire opera to judge it properly.  There are sections where the subject is interpersonal between man and wife, including text from Baudelaire, and those sections are quite beautiful.  Adams' music is wonderful and, at times, challenging.  What he did with the text quoted above was actually quite interesting musically.

The documentary was very well done, although the narrator was a bit monotone for my tastes.  This didn't really take much away from the presentation, as the bulk of the material was comprised of shots of rehearsals, interviews with the composer and conductor, as well as archival footage of interviews with scientists and plenty of war and bomb footage.  I round the archival interviews and footage to be fascinating and I think it added a lot to the overall presentation.  I was particularly interested in the interviews with the physicists and would recommend this disc for only this, were it not for the rest of the disc being very good as well.

I would definitely recommend this disc to anyone who is interested in either the creative process of preparing an opera, or, less strongly, anyone who is interested in the atomic bomb (and opera).  I think that this disc is certainly more suited to opera fans who are interested in science than for science/atomic bomb fans who are not terribly interested in opera.

I think that Oppenheimer would have approved of this opera and this disc.",1224633600,3,2240,4.83989501312336

8304975,4,B001GCVK0A,"This is mainly a behind-the-scenes account of the making of the John Adams opera Doctor Atomic.  The central character in the opera is J. Robert Oppenheimer, who headed the Los Alamos Project that developed the first atomic bomb, the one used to devastating effect against Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  He is famous for quoting the God Shiva from the Bhagavad-Gita, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""  Clips of Oppenheimer reveal him as a charming, seductive man, worthy of an opera both by historical place and personality.

The main character of the documentary isn't so definite, but Peter Sellars, who staged the opera, pretty well steals the show whenever he's on screen, which is a lot.  The strongest appeal, though, will probably be for those who love the music of John Adams, who can see how he works, how the music comes together, and how some of it ends up.  There are extensive rehearsal scenes.

Along with the behind-the-scenes material is some background about Oppenheimer, reminiscences about him from others, and some history of what led to the use of the bomb and its effects, with good use of archival film.  This is all interesting, and the historical footage of atomic bombs exploding is made eerily beautiful, but the it's subsidiary to the focus on the opera, which is put in harrowing context.

Not being a particular fan of Adams, I wasn't as moved by the experience as I think many who are more fond of his music would be.  The work is grand and sincere.  For me, the most appealing parts were the brief clips of Oppenheimer himself, and the overall story of how an opera comes together, particularly one helmed by Sellars, who might make a good subject for an opera himself.",1261440000,,1720,4.757575757575758
8304976,5,B001GCVK0A,"When I heard about this documentary, I just knew I had to see it.  No only am I huge physics geek, but I am a great lover of the opera and other performing arts.  Even more, through the good graces of a friend at the opera, I was at the final dress rehearsal before the world premiere of Doctor Atomic in San Francisco!

I remember it so well.  It was truly an exciting evening--just before the opening of a major new composition.  The opera itself was stunning, but also full of tension.  A literal ticking down was taking place on the stage in the opera, and in the opera house as everyone frantically prepared for opening night.  I remember so clearly the brief speeches that director Peter Sellars and composer John Adams made at the end of the night.  What a privilege to witness it all!  I had no idea a documentary crew was filming at the time.

The thing is, this documentary is about so much more than the making of an opera.  It would be more accurate to say that it's about the making of the story that inspired the opera.  In addition to singers and composers, this film interviews physicists and historians, and intercuts archival and contempory footage of the figures from Los Alamos.  Most notable are the many clips of Robert Oppenheimer as an older man discussing everything from nuclear proliferation to poetry.  Physicist Freeman Dyson (who knew Oppenheimer late in the latter's life) says, ""I'm not suprised they've made an opera about Oppenheimer.  In many ways he was an operatic figure.""  The story is inherently dramatic and very, very eerie.  The staging of Doctor Atomic reflects that.

The idea behind the opera belonged to John Adams.  The documentary follows the opera from when it was still being written, through the first rehearsal, to the final dress.  It's so fascinating to watch the various collaborations that are part of the artistic process.  Some moments are heavy--as when one week before opening one of the lead performers was suddenly replaced by his understudy.  Others are much lighter, such as the footage of the large prop nuclear bomb being driven on an open truck bed down Van Ness Avenue to be loaded into the opera house.  (Hardly the strangest thing I've seen on the streets of San Francisco.)  Or when Adams tells the lead singer to ""sing it like it was written by... a good composer.""  Moments of humor to leaven the drama.

In addition to interviews and digressions and footage of actual bombs exploding, there is footage of the opera in various stages of rehearsal.  The music and staging are magnificent, and will leave almost anyone wanting to see the opera in its entirety.  This film covered so much diverse territory that at first I thought it was just too all over the place.  As I contimnued to watch I decided that, on the contrary, this was a documentary with something for everyone.

8304977,4,B001GCVK0A,"The Atomic Bomb & Opera.  Three words you probably thought you'd never see used together.  And yet that's exactly what the documentary, ""Wonders Are Many,"" is all about: Making an Opera about the Atomic Bomb!

Part history lesson, Part opera rehearsal, Wonders Are Many focuses on the creator of the A Bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the US Military's insistance that this powerfully destructive force be created in order to stop Hitler and Japan during World War II.  Interspersed throughout the film are some eye opening atomic blasts which display to the viewer the sheer violence & power these weapons of mass destruction actually have.

Plus it gives a real appreciation of what it takes to put one of these types of operas together.  The constant rehearsals, the changing of parts to other performers, the actual mold work of all the props, including the Atom Bomb itself.  A sheer spectacle.

The film simultaneously explores scientist Robert Oppenheimer's work in developing the atomic bomb and director Peter Sellars and composer David Adam's creation of an opera based on this work (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Atomic/dp/B001BSH18O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Atomic</a>).  The two sides of the story flow together beautifully.  Footage from the tests in New Mexico, and from interviews with Oppenheimer and fellow scientist Freeman Dyson, is accompanied to music from the opera.  Verite footage from rehearsals for the opera, combined with interviews with the creative team, serve to show both parallels and contrasts between the rigorous process of creation in art and discovery in science.  It is an exciting film, both because the ideas it explores are probing and highly relevant, and because the filmmaker knows how to edit for maximum impact, to reveal the human and practical difficulties of both stories only gradually.  It helps that the people involved, both the scientists and the artists, are so articulate and thoughtful.  One thing that particularly struck me was that the director of the film is quite accomplished as an interviewer: nearly everything that was said in the film by the various participants felt as though it came from a spontaneous and natural process of reflection on their own work on the part of the artist.  Nothing sounded like a rehearsed response.  There was both a fresh sense of real, living, thinking beings captured on film, and a polished clarity and artistry to the way in which their words and their images were organized.  Highly recommended for those who appreciate fine documentaries, and for those interested in science, art, and especially the opera.  The music is engaging and the singing throughout is gorgeous.  Very fine work.

On a technical note: I did notice that when I played this on my dvd player at home the images were a bit jumpy here and there, but it didn't recur when I played it on my computer.  My home dvd player is several years old and that may account for the issue -- though I don't have similar problems with other dvds, played before and after. I can only assume this is due to the fact that these are manufactured ""on demand"" on dvd-r disks rather than printed directly.

In any case, I highly recommend purchase of the DVD release of the Netherlands Opera presentation of the full opera with the original cast, direction, and scenery.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adams-Doctor-Atomic/dp/B001BSH18O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adams: Doctor Atomic</a>&nbsp;The DVD of the opera includes brief comments by the lead singers and a long interview with Sellers, who directed the opera.  The Netherlands production also includes significant changes made by John Adams after the San Francisco premiere. The MET production will most likely appear on DVD sometime in 2009.  I recommend the Netherlands DVD as a first choice.",1227916800,,1072,5.852564102564102
