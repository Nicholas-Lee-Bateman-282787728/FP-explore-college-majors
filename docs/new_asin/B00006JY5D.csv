7970738,4,B00006JY5D,"Very good movie, a bit too reminiscent of the 1960's current of the ""nouvelle vague"", perhaps, and that would not be a flaw, whatsoever, if it wasn't that its insistence in finding a style evoking what had been already made decades ago, at times, proves distracting, and convoluted, especially for the narration of what is a complex plotting and a somewhat strange, and gruesomely shocking case, about a young man suffering of a highly disturbed mind, and, consequently envisioning society, as an enemy, which he wants to fight by becoming a tragic outlaw, a rebel without a cause of sort, but truly painted in pitch black here, we meet him at first hanging out like a playboy of sort on the French Riviera, and we are almost put to uncomfortably feel for his bizarre manners while he slowly turns into a fascinating, if naive liar at first, and,  eventually,  into a terminal sociopath, and the most unforgiving assassin: i believed the movie was successful here to stage a raw & disturbing atmosphere, that gets to completely involve the audience into its chills, while we become nerve wrecking along with Roberto's disturbing climax which we almost get to live in first person. He likes women a lot, he seems extremely horned up, and he candidly assaults them, in public places, while the girls at first seem amused and never worried. Roberto is an extremely dangerous man, and his victims are in fact mostly women who, quite inexplicably, all seem to fall for him and his rage, then, way much too late, the poor things become aware of his troubled personality, and  of his vicious instincts, so they get normally raped, and, one of them, even seems almost  to be compliant at some point, a very controversial choice, i thought, but quite unexpected. However he eventually either murders them, or let them go back to their apparent misery, becoming sympathetic of their bland lives. The script makes of this weird plot a quite interesting, haunting study of a young Italian man, whose life looks like hell had broken loose earlier on, and now it's running desperately out of control, while, he's also increasingly closer to get caught by a severe search, organized by an alert of the detectives of the international police all trying to figure the killings out! If we don't truly part with him, at times, we could be sympathetic, for some very strange reason, i could not myself quite analyze, while, the story keeps the pace, and it becomes enthralling, and, very emotionally charged, making of this an always original, and extremely gritty movie, even though, unfortunately, it is not always successful with its choices, or either does completely come all together fully satisfyingly, at the end. But, there are some extremely fine moments, and a raw intensity that might be resulting as gripping, as it is certainly visually original. The film also works with the noticeable contributions provided by the use of sound design, and of the good cinematography, truly making the best of the darkness of the story, and photographing suggestive, gloomy landscapes, and towns' outskirts, with great results influencing the emotional involvement we are pulled in, and made believe, and it is a wild run! While, French director, Cedric Kahn has definitely a distinctive, personal vision of film making, that is innovative, when not too heavily stylized, i found casting a bit troubling: all the women in the movie seem to have a very unattractive, and out of time look, they seem out dated, at least, and the acting is often indicated, or their faces are just too bizarre to result completely believable, and, i thought that was a main problem, but, at the contrary, the casting of then newcomer actor, Stefano Cassetti, with his deep blue eyes, and enigmatic facial expressions, works a lot better. Cassetti can be attractive throughout, and works hard to make of his Roberto Succo a real person. However, the movie seems also to be shifting away from him a little too often, giving a lot of screen time to the other side of the story, that is the investigation of the police, concentrated mainly in the sub plot of a middle aged French detective who's determined to track him down. And, there's a little too much time given also to some of the women's not always compelling sub plots, too, resulting to be a bit distracting, and leaving, the lead character a bit in the shade, so that he definitely ends up to be a mystery. But i am not sure i can be convinced by a character who's psychologically not completely resolved, and, with motivations highly lacking back story, so that it ends up making of Cassetti's fine work, a character that somehow has gotten lost along the way, and that's a pity, since Cassetti again was interesting enough to carry the movie, but, he's ultimately confusingly coming to an end: he's very heavily sexed up, and obsessed with sex, which he does however not always consume, then he appears to long for love and attention, but even that is never completely true, or happening, he has completely obscure political beliefs he's trying hard to endorse, and while he's constantly frustrated by a various number of reasons, he just increasingly gets lost, and becomes even out of focus, toward the end, creating, at least for me, a true mystery. But is Roberto Succo an enigmatic man we can never get completely to know, or does he end up too obscure of a dilemma, lost in the director's script and vision? This hardly makes for a completely successful, and consistent movie, although, i must say that ""Roberto Succo"" manages exceptionally to still have its chilling charms.",1441584000,,5599,4.853556485355648
