Editorial Reviews
Students will learn that motion is relative. They will also discover that motion is caused by forces and is dependent on whether these forces are balanced or unbalanced. This program presents a clear explanation of Newton's Laws of Motion. Explore the key idea of net force and how it relates to motion and balance. Includes a fun, hands-on activity that allows kids to test Newton's Third Law of Motion by using a 'balloon rocket' on a string. Based on concepts outlined in the National Science Education Standards for Physical Science. 2000. 23 minutes. Grades 5-8.",1343606400,,722,4.909836065573771
