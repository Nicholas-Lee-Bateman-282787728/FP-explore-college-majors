8041868,2,B0006JNJT4,"I purchased this DVD thinking to see Gloriella do her thing. She did some dancing. However, this DVD is a copy from a not very good VHS copy. The picture quality is not sharp. The audio is terrible. There are no special features. Yet, the cover at the stop states ""Edicin Especial"". There are no end credits, which for me was sad because I wanted to know who played ""Tuitila"" and the doctor's wife, ""Mara"". ""Rarotonga"" is supposed to be an erotic shaman from the Guatemalan jungle. But, she lives in a modern penthouse with swimming pool. Her costumes are non-jungle at all. They are more the Las Vegas showgirl type. What is funny is that the two doctors wear full length office suits in the jungle, living in a hut! On the back cover it states that ""Rarotonga"" meets up with modern civilization due to an airplane crash. However, the only airplane crash is at the end of the movie.  And yes, this movie is very 70ish! If the VHS version of this movie exists, get that, not the DVD. Better yet, Rarotonga should be remade with Shakira!",1313971200,,1036,4.481481481481482
