8732289,2,B0151SDXTA,"Definitely kind of a crappy movie. There were a few redeeming qualities, and scenes. One of which being that me and my husband were unpaid extras in this movie. So that's cool. If you have no reason other than someone you know was in or helped on this movie, don't buy it. You will be disappointed. Overall, 2 out of 5 on a good day.",1452038400,,333,4.138461538461539
