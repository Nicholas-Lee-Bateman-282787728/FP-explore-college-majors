8594277,3,B00DL7CUHA,"Great stretches, however I think it took way too long to go from one to the other while the trainer was describing how to do each one. Also, I had hoped to hear the actual prayers so I could fallow along. The sound quality was poor for that. Better pictures with smoother transitions should be applied as well.
I only played this 2 times, mainly because it takes way too long to get from one stretch to the other. As I stated before, it takes too long for each stretch to be described and shown. That should have been done in a separate tutorial. Then do another filming of the stretches going from one to the other, in a smooth fashion.",1503532800,,637,4.2727272727272725
8594278,3,B00DL7CUHA,Good exercises. Audio problems for my older machine.  Can't hear the teacher only the background music.  Worked fine in my laptop though.  The company told me it won't play properly on older machines just newer ones.,1462233600,,216,4.944444444444445
8594279,4,B00DL7CUHA,"This is a wonderful program that is easy to do.  The meditative part comes after you have learned the moves.  Since I didn't feel any real effort doing the program, I was surprised  after the first time at how sore my muscles were the next day! Since I have MS, I love that there is an adaptive way to the exercises.  If the program has one fault it is that it should have two versions -- the way it is when you are learning the moves and one without the commentary and just the Rosary for after you have learned the moves.",1415836800,2,523,4.098039215686274
8594280,4,B00DL7CUHA,Extremely simple and easy to follow. As described. There is no printed explanation accompanying the DVD.  Ship packaging leaves much to be desired.,1409356800,2,147,5.391304347826087
8594281,5,B00DL7CUHA,"I'm used to extremely challenging exercise and this is wonderful to change the pace or do on off days. The stretching are what one might see in a dance or ballet class. Though it may not be hi intensity interval strength training, it is challenging in that you have to maintain proper body structure without straining. Regulating your breathing along with the exercises and the prayer may also take some time to learn. I think it its worth learning to do because your physical exercise becomes a spiritual one. The Rosary is a beautiful prayer and it is sung angelically by a choir of nuns. This is definitely a restorative routine. God Bless All of You",1394064000,5,653,4.637931034482759
8594282,5,B00DL7CUHA,"I ordered this DVD because I was searching for a Catholic alternative to Yoga.  I wanted a stretching routine that was more in-line with my religious beliefs.  This DVD definitely fit the bill.  The routine is effective, yet easy to follow.  I love the chants in the background as well as the religious images throughout the video.  I follow a combined running & prayer program since I belong to LIFE Runners, a national pro-life running team.  I found this DVD to be particularly useful during my half-marathon training.  Rather than take a rest day after my long run, I would complete this routine.  It was not only a perfect way to end my training week (both physically and spiritually), but it helped to speed my recovery.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking to combine both their Catholic faith and fitness.",1381363200,9,823,4.73943661971831
