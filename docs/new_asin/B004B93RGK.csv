4314656,5,B004B93RGK,This movie with Mickey Rouke and Diane Lane was a super action movie with alot of surprises. Mickey plays a great hire for kill person who surprises you at every turn. Diane Lane was really good in her role. The scene with Rouke where he does something that is totally unsupected was a cool scene. edge of seat movie.,1301875200,4,317,4.389830508474576
8421726,4,B004B93RGK,Gripping film.  Rourke is a great actor because he plays a different type person in every film.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a memorable performance.  Diane Lane and Thomas Jane are okay.  I think this film could have been more.  The Elmore Leonard story is better but isn't that always the case?  I gave 4 stars because Rourke and Levitt are so skilled in their performances.,1429833600,,375,4.78125

8421732,4,B004B93RGK,"I ordered this and had never seen it before this, and I liked it a lot. it was a good action/thriller with a proper amount of suspense. Rourke is great as always and the other acting is good as well.",1374624000,,199,4.0
8421733,5,B004B93RGK,"I lived in this area in which the story takes place and Leonard nailed it. The tone, of the characters in this area the darkness of Detroit and Toronto underworld are spot on. Rourke had a particularly good role and had allot of depth. I've known characters like him and it was haunting to see him portray an Indian hitman with an inner soul but a hardened exterior with rules he doesn't break. The crazed killer can't remember his name was also great a real departure from what I've seen him do in the past, sort of a really crazy guy. Just really liked this movie but I like Elmore Leonard anyhow",1374105600,3,598,4.348214285714286
