2455534,5,B000CC1TPG,"This is the one ""Mystery Classics"" DVD devoted solely to Sherlock Holmes.  Murder at the Baskervilles, and The Sign of Four, are full length movies (of course that means it's still only an hour or a little longer).  The rest are half hour TV episodes with Ronald Howard as Holmes.  The Ronald Howard episodes are well made and in the Victorian period and most are based on actual Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  I have several editions of Holmes on DVD, including a number of episodes on this DVD.  But let's face it.  At this price, even if you buy it for a single movie or episode, it's well worth it.",1295654400,11,614,4.389380530973451

8096840,5,B000CC1TPG,"This is a very good set of these movies. They have all been digitally remastered, which makes the picture pretty clear. While I love both Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Britt's interpretation of Holmes, this was a fun one as well. Plus there were a couple of stories on here that I have not seen previously.",1472169600,,302,4.509090909090909

8096846,5,B000CC1TPG,"Arthur Wontner starred as Holmes in a series of movies. His interpretation of Holmes is gentle and civil. The stories are well known by any Conan Doyle enthusiast, but the screen plays but a slightly different focus on them. If you love Sherlock Holmes, I would certainly recommend them. If you're a mystery lover, Sherlock Holmes is the best of the best. These films are family friendly.",1395705600,8,388,4.8059701492537314
8096847,4,B000CC1TPG,"I have all the Mystery Classics series and I give this volume the same review I gave all the others. This volume has the same pluses and minuses as the others. A good cross section of types of mysteries - some good, some no so good. Quality varies from film to film but almost all are enjoyable",1383091200,3,294,4.175438596491228
