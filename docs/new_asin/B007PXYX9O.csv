8520792,4,B007PXYX9O,"This is about a homeless camp in Nashville where as many as ninety people resided at times, for different reason which are shared. The city tells them they will soon have to move as there will be work done on the overpass they reside under. Then flooding occurs so they have to find a different place, meanwhile they live in motels on FEMA's tab!

Some land is donated but locals decry the location. An 'election' is held to get a homeless person on a homeless council. Interesting, insightful, sad.",1518912000,,499,4.606741573033708
8520793,4,B007PXYX9O,They did a great job in telling the behind the scene stories and embedding themselves in the world of the homeless living in tents. It is getting tougher to live with higher and higher rents.  I'm just surprised there are not 10 tie more people living in tents.,1508544000,,261,4.4375

8520795,4,B007PXYX9O,"I watched this last night via Netflix and highly recommend it. About a large homeless camp in Nashville, focusing on the people in it so we get to know them. Gives you a real feeling for who they are and what they need. Also, unfortunately, how extreme the prejudice is against them. I have great respect for the church people who are helping them.",1384128000,2,348,4.453125
