8068420,2,B0009WIY3Y,"Waaaay too much bouncing for D cup!! That's before you even get on the step. Not a full circuit either, NO AB WORK! It's good to get your heart rate up but too much time wasted jogging in place on the floor. The only pro is it's simple enough to turn down the volume and work with your own music which is a necessity with all of these DVDs bc the music is always terrible and UNmotivating.",1454284800,,389,4.064935064935065
