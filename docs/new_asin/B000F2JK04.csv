8116616,2,B000F2JK04,"Like there aren't already enough bargain-basement video companies out there, along comes ""Cheezy Flicks Entertainment.""  I was already suspicious when they issued&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Planet-Mars/dp/B000G28GHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Planet Mars</a>, a rarely-seen yet quite serious early 50's sci-fi film...not really ""cheesy"" at all.  But I'm a huge fan/collector of sci-fi trailers, so I decided to give this one a try.

To say that I was disappointed is putting it mildly.  Most of these trailers look like they were dubbed from VHS tapes recorded in the EP mode about 25 years ago.  You can actually see the video ""noise"" signal in some places (if you don't know what that is, imagine a tracking error that you can't correct).  The few color ones included are so washed-out, they may as well be in black & white.

Really, the only thing to recommend this collection is the fact that there are several rarely-seen trailers included: Barbarella, Fire Maidens from Outer Space, Konga, Phantom from Space, Day of the Triffids are scattered among more familiar clips like War of the Worlds, Them, and It Came From Outer Space (none of which, by the way, a real sci-fi fan would consider ""cheesy"").

If you like this sort of thing, and are forgiving of REALLY questionable quality, you might get a kick out of this disc.  But for most viewers, it's probably not worth the money.",1212969600,5,1450,5.324561403508772
