SYNOPSES--
Translation of THE BOXER's original Italian title (""Un uomo dalla pelle dura"") is ""Tough-skinned Man."" It's also available under such names as ""The Boxer,"" ""Tough Guy,"" ""Murder in the Ring"" and ""Counter Punch.""
In it, fight manager Nick da Catarina (Ferzetti) receives threats from mobsters that his ""boy"" Teddy 'Cherokee' Wilcox (Blake) had better lose this upcoming fight-- or else. Cherokee refuses to ""lay down."" He wins the bout and Nick ends up dead. Police Captain Perkins (Borgnine) tries to prove that Cherokee murdered his manager.

If what they say about the sport is true, THE WRESTLER is an absolute piece of fiction. Here, an idealistic promoter (Asner) fights a corrupt network of gangsters, dishonest promoters and gamblers as he publicizes what he hopes will be above-board matches for an aging champion.
Appearing as themselves are many of this sport's stars who were active in the 1960s and 70s.
