2014159,4,B0001M7OI8,"Of all the holocaust movies I've seen, I can't recall any others that focus on the children.  Parents who would like to teach their children about the holocaust of the Jews during W.W.II would do well to show their children this movie because it is something to which they would be able to relate.  There is little, if any bad language or violence; there is one brief sex scene between the mime and the children's teacher.  On the whole, it is a wholesome movie about a great evil.

Quite a bit has been written by some other reviewers regarding Stella's fully naked body shown in one scene.  It needs to be emphasized that it is in no way erotic; it is simply the thinking of a young girl who has been living in a dorm where baths and simply changing clothes would be in full view of the others, much like the Jewish Kibbutz children in Palestine during the same era.  The only observation I would make is that it seems inconsistent for her to get in the tub with her underwear on, say ""no looking"" and then a few minutes later come into the next room innocently naked.

Another interesting element in this movie is that the mime was not Jewish.  He, in fact, was held in suspicion by the Jews for some time.  Parents, especially of Jewish children, might want to point out to their children that it wasn't just Jews the Germans killed.

The reason I don't give this five stars is that the whole episode seems to have been pointless.  There is no evidence that anyone except the German officers and Jews, people within the ghetto, got the message of the Hansel & Gretel mime play.  Apparently, the Red Cross people didn't understand the message, and were even so stupid they would buy that the mime had already left the camp for Paris only a few minutes after the show.

The main value of this movie is that it is one that can be used to show children what the ghettos during The Holocaust were like in a way that the children can relate.

[There is now a 2005 movie entitled ""Fateless"" that deals with a child's view of the Holocost.  It is about a 14-year-old boy who is taken off a Budapest bus and sent to the concentration camps.  He survivied the experience, and it is based on his actual real-life experiences.  Unfortunately, it is in Hungarian, with subtitles.  However, it is a NY Times 'Critic's Pick' movie and I feel it it worth watching even with the subtitiles.]",1145750400,,2378,4.440092165898617
2014160,2,B0001M7OI8,"I did not enjoy this movie very much. After reading what this movie was about, I really had high hopes for it. I expected it to be very interesting and moving. But after watching it, I was somewhat disappointed. One of the  flaws of this movie is that it focuses too heavily on the friendship  between the main character and the little girl (the main child character).  She becomes obsessed with him and develops a crush on him. She gets jealous  and possessive when he tries to help or be with others, whether they be  children or adults. I certainly did not like the part where the man had  another innocent child take her place in the transport to the death camp.  In addition, I strongly suspect that her voice was dubbed with a woman's  voice. It did not sound like a little girl's voice at all. Another of this  movie's flaws is that the play at the end of the movie, where the main  character and the children try to show the Red Cross what is really  happening  to the Jews of Europe, was, in my opinion, not very well done.  The children were pushed into a space that was supposed to represent a gas  chamber, and then they were quickly pulled out. The main character, knowing  that he and the children were going to be killed anyway, should have  concluded the play by having the children lie down and pretend to  ""sleep."" This would have sent a less ambiguous message to the red  cross. Overall, despite these weaknesses (and several others), I found the  movie to be passable, and am not discouraging anyone from watching it.  However, I will certainly not add it to my collection of Holocaust movies.  Some Holocaust movies that I feel are much better, and would strongly  recommend, include Schindler's List, Sophie's Choice, Europa, Europa,  Escape from Sobibor, Good Evening Mr. Wallenberg, Life is Beautiful, and  Triumph of the Spirit (the latter two movies being among the best movies I  have ever seen).",954806400,,1923,4.601769911504425

8014451,5,B0001M7OI8,Lovely story nicely make by one of the best Czech directors Karel Kachyna. Ota Hofman is the legend of Czech writters for children with still popular TVseries PAN TAU namely  in german speaking countries. Poetic imagination without today's necasary galons of blood,1378771200,,264,5.285714285714286
8014452,4,B0001M7OI8,"It's a shame this film isn't better known. It's a heartbreaking look at the Holocaust by showing what went on in a sham model community set up to satisfy the Red Cross before Nazi atrocities were realized. Under Nazi supervision, Tom Courtney stages a performance hinting at the destruction of children. Once established, the story sustains a dramatic edge to the end.",1269648000,,368,4.951612903225806
8014453,5,B0001M7OI8,"The Last Butterfly is a collage of controversial, brilliant, and heartbreaking, performances as well as containing a fine amount of humor providing us the in-between fragments of true humanity and soul the victims contained within themselves even in the darkest hours of there lives. This film has a fine cast of wonderful performances, the children are fantastic and I do love the mime characteristic of the film, it's splendid. This is a beautiful motion picture without the shiny polished Hollywood glam.",1257120000,,507,5.271604938271605
8014454,4,B0001M7OI8,"This is another ""holocaust story,"" and another good one on the grim subject. It isn't as well-done as ""Schlinder's List"" but it doesn't have the overt horror scenes or the profanity of ""Schindler's List"" either. It makes the film more palatable, if you can call a grim subject like that ""palatable."" It just isn't as horrific in visuals, is all I am saying.

Nevertheless, this is still a powerful story and well-acted and photographed. Tom Courtenay stars and does an outstanding job. He even shows a lot of talent in the art of mime. This is good storytelling. The PG-13 rating is for nudity in here, usually the kind that gives it an R-rating.",1239753600,,646,4.666666666666667
8014455,2,B0001M7OI8,I am very irritated that Amazon does not list anywhere that this movie is dubbed. I'm also irritated that it's dubbed in the first place. Thank you to everyone who wrote a review mentioning that this film is dubbed since Amazon neglected to provide this information at all. I would buy this movie if they offered a subtitled version.,1165449600,,333,4.661016949152542
8014456,3,B0001M7OI8,"This is a chilling movie, but also slow paced.  Tom Courtenay, in the role of a famous mime, is forced to stage a childrens play for the Gestapo to show the Red Cross that all is well in the 'Jew Town'.  He slowly comes to the understanding of what is happening to the Jews, and he makes the play more and more elaborate, with a larger and larger cast.  Unlike in Schindler's List, where the list meant life, his list only provides transient protection.

The movie is dubbed, and some of the singing voices appear to be all from one person.  But then again, this is not a high budget film.  Other than scene selection, there are no bells and whistles on the DVD.",1151798400,,662,4.298387096774194
