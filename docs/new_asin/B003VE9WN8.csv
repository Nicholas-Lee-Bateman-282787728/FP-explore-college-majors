8406704,5,B003VE9WN8,"This DVD does itself a dis-service by it's name and lack of description. It's a packed DVD with almost 90 mins of material. You get 2 shows, one from the 1990's and 1 show of him singing in NY around 2002.
  This DVD was put together in 2010 by those who truly love and admire Rudy Ray Moore, it wasn't just slapped together but has lots of goodies in it as well as lots of written material on the back of the DVD cover.
  The quality of the live shows aren't too bad, good camera angles and so forth, the audio is good and clean, they were filmed on camcorders or the house camera's, not HD but not bad to watch!
 It's a must own for any Rudy Ray fan!",1367971200,3,652,3.9846153846153847
