5339563,2,B009HWEN8M,"The only topic the movie seems to cover in-depth is that of the birth of the Mayan led political party in Guatemala. Beyond that, most topics are only glossed over and doesn't really discuss any cultural aspects that indicate any sort of renaissance. I would not recommend this movie.",1352073600,3,284,4.816326530612245
5339564,5,B009HWEN8M,This movie is a must see! Everyone should take a few hours out of their day and watch this film!,1351555200,2,96,3.85
5339565,5,B009HWEN8M,"This documentary really blew me away! With all the 2012 nonsense going on right now, I admittedly was not the most thrilled to watch this movie. But as I began to watch, I saw an untold story of the past, present, and future of the Mayan people. I grew up in Central America and learned so much watching this film.

I actually loved this movie so much I shared it with my church. We do mission trips to Guatemala every summer. We screened it at our church and had all of the young people that have gone or are interested in going to Guatemala watched it. Those that had never been were more impassioned to go than ever before, and those who had already been kept saying how much they learned and how this movie challenged some of the beliefs that they had held about Mayan culture.

A really great documentary and I can't wait to see the other ones that the PeaceJam foundation will be putting out over the years! You've got a fan in me!",1350950400,4,937,4.288135593220339
5339566,5,B009HWEN8M,Very thought provoking film.  I must say that I found the 'newsreel' section very informative as well.  The historical and political views were particulary interesting.,1350432000,2,168,5.68
5339567,5,B009HWEN8M,"Excellent film, check it out! Makes me want to learn more about the Mayan culture. Enjoyable and informative, well directed!",1349913600,2,124,5.25
5339568,5,B009HWEN8M,"A truly astonishing film that informs the viewer and deserves recognition. ""Mayan Renaissance"" is an extremely moving and thought provoking film. This film will help in leading the viewer towards the achievement of insight.",1349913600,2,223,5.588235294117647
5339569,5,B009HWEN8M,"Not only did I find this film extremely informative on Mayan history, it told their story with such a beautiful delivery. I recommend that everyone, young and old see this film ASAP and stop freaking out about the world ending. And if you thought the Mayans were extinct than that is just plain wrong. They're alive and kickin' and this film tells you what they have to say!",1349481600,,374,4.514705882352941
5339570,5,B009HWEN8M,"There is plenty of mis-information out there on the 2012 sensational issue. PeaceJam have worked with the Mayans on many other projects previously and have gained their trust to help them tell the real story of 2012. This bridges the style of true cinema-verite documentaries in some sections and keeps it moving with other sections that you will love if you are a Michael Moore fan. You will come away with a much more balanced view of our futures, and a bit of inspiration to 'do better.'",1349395200,,490,4.64367816091954
5339571,5,B009HWEN8M,"This gorgeous film gets at your heart as it tells the story of the Mayan people over thousands of years.  Learn about the glory of the ancient Mayan civilizations, they horror of the arrival of the Spanish, and a movement to regain the country for the indigenous people.  I loved this film, cried a few times, had my mind blown, and more.  I'd recommend this to anyone who has a soul!",1349049600,,384,4.380281690140845

8541692,1,B009HWEN8M,"This was a blank DVD, nothing was on it. Not worth returning it. I can't rate the content, since I can't see it!",1388880000,,112,3.9130434782608696
8541693,3,B009HWEN8M,"Worth seeing and informative, but don't expect tight structure.  Tries to cover a lot of ground with mixed success.  Contemporary updates are interesting, esp Winaq Party, the new primarily Mayan political party.",1388448000,,212,5.59375
8541694,5,B009HWEN8M,"I wanted to thank the people who put this together , it is helpful to send someone this link to watch this movie and get informed!",1365206400,,130,4.038461538461538
8541695,5,B009HWEN8M,I love this film for teaching me the real story of the Mayan's.  Very informative and the story comes directly from the mouths of Mayan people.  This film is a great way to dispel all the myths!,1355616000,,194,4.216216216216216
8541696,5,B009HWEN8M,Wow this was a very powerful film.  The research and thought that went in to was clearly very extensive.  The Mayan people and the people of Guatemala finally get there story told.,1355356800,,180,4.59375
8541697,5,B009HWEN8M,"Mayan renaissance is an intriguing one hour nine minutes documentary bringing into limelight the forgotten ancient Maya civilization and their fight for freedom and finally their emergence from all the sufferings. It is a beautifully woven script which reflects both beauty as well as heart wrenching happenings about their civilization.
I have learnt in history that one of the fascinating things about them is their extraordinary skill to establish a great civilization in a tropical rainforest climate unlike other civilizations where ancient people had flourished in drier climates. This thought provoking and comprehensive film shares Mayans vision for their future as well as their 100-year plan to lead civilization forward from 2012 on. The entire mood of the film can be understood in a very easy manner. The movie also covers the birth of the Mayan led political party in Guatemala. This film surely can help those interested in understanding the Mayan culture on a deeper level.
It definitely is a must see movie as it would surely challenge some of the beliefs possessed about Mayan culture before watching this documentary. I am looking forward to see the other movies that the PeaceJam foundation will be coming up with!",1353628800,,1234,5.206030150753769
8541698,4,B009HWEN8M,"This is a story that has been needed to be told for a long time--how the Mayan were destroyed by the Spanish and colonialism, how America is implicated in their ruin in the 20th century, and how now they are seeing some light through political savvy.",1353628800,,250,4.456521739130435
8541699,5,B009HWEN8M,"I've spent a lot of my leisure time reading about history, mostly ancient and religious history. Discovering the story of the Mayans was such a revelation to me; understanding what they believe and why they believe it.  I was spurred to learn more about the Mayan history, being that we are on the cusp of December 21, 2012. This movie was exactly what I needed. It is Very intelligent, informative, well crafted documentary, very detailed and easy to understand.

I would recommend this video for those wanting to understand the Mayan culture on a deeper level; this is definitely the documentary to chose. It presents almost the same information as ""Cracking the Maya Code"", but a much more comprehensive, detailed study.",1353456000,,723,4.966942148760331
8541700,5,B009HWEN8M,Out of all the information that's out there I thought this film was the most unified. It combined facts from Mayan history in an easy to understand way and streamlined it into our present and future. The real talk from the Mayan people as well as Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu really put a face and voice to the prophecies the Mayans predicted. I appreciate the message a lot and am going to pass it on to friends and family in place of me preaching about our path of ignorance and destruction :),1352937600,,494,4.32258064516129
