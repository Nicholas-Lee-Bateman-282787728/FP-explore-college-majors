8129858,5,B000GAKQEY,The movie is an eccentric fairytale and it most enjoyable. A very unique feel for a different take on the folklore of Jack frost,1375488000,,128,4.375
8129859,4,B000GAKQEY,"In a land far away in winter-time, there lived a lovely young woman who has a great braid named Nastenka who falls in love with a traveling young man wh would later turn into a half-man half-bear creature from a Mushroom sprite as he had to earn trust from someone who needs help, meets up with a creepy hunchback witch to all the way to trying to find Jack Frost who can solve their problems.

A very bizarre, artistic and enjoyable Russian-Finnish fantasy-comedy with not much of a plot but has very good design on creatures, sets and authentic scenery of the Russian woods where it was filmed. it does have it's own originality to it and and one of the better movies to appear on MST3L despite being not bad at all.",1308700800,,718,4.398496240601504
8129860,4,B000GAKQEY,I got this version specifically because it's the same dub as the MST3K episodes.  It's a sort of sweet film.  This DVD release looks like a second generation dub of a VHS tape.  When the taped version of the MST3k show looks better than a DVD you know it's a quality production.  but hey!  for 6 bucks or whatever hard to say it's not a good deal.,1298332800,,347,4.119402985074627
8129861,5,B000GAKQEY,It's still really bizaar when I see that little girl eating a lollypop in bed...eeeeeeeeek. Cool movie none-the-less.,1245196800,,117,5.555555555555555
8129862,5,B000GAKQEY,This movie was made in 1967 and not in 1934 as stated. It is a Russian movie and used to be televised on Channel 11 once a year in the seventies. I always enjoyed watching this movie. It took years before it was released on DVD several years ago.,1227312000,6,246,4.040816326530612
