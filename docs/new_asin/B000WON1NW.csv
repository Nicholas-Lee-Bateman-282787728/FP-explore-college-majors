8224461,1,B000WON1NW,"Once again, the video editor kills a concert DVD. At least, when they focus on John Fogerty, they let the camera stay on him for more than 4 seconds.

It seems like the film editor must have heard or been told that the drummer is considered in the top of his class (noted on the web that Kenny Aronoff is one of the world's most influential and in-demand drummers)...so they do a quick shot of Kenny on the drums...and I mean quick, about 1-2 seconds. Then we see John Fogerty for some more, another quick shot of Kenny for 1 second, and on and on. Aronoff is an awesome drummer and driving the show on the skins...let the viewer watch him play, for more than 1 second shots!!! The other guys in the band, the video filmer/editor must have forgot they are needed to create the total concert sound and you rarely see any of these players. I know John Fogerty is the star and the show, but let's enjoy seeing the other players that are contributing. If the editor was next to me...I'd strangle him next time he jumped scenes in a second! Maybe this is a new career for me...filming bands concerts and editing...and actually letting the viewer have a visual experience comparable to how you would view it if you were there. Do you really go to concerts and look different directions every 1-2 seconds? Only if you're having a seizure!!!

Think you get the point. The overall concert was kind of lame in my opinion. Not Fogerty's best. Song selection was mediocre. Save your money and get Long Road Home DVD instead...that one is much better though doesn't have Kenny Aaronoff on drums (once again, he crushes the skins).",1318896000,5,1617,4.515358361774744
8224462,4,B000WON1NW,"If you line John Fogerty (as me), you will like this DVD. It's only 40 minutos of show, 20 each music, but the master guitarrist shows why he is still the one of the most marvellous of the world. He is now sixteen and a few years, but the voice is the same as when he was Creedence's soul.",1307836800,3,289,3.9152542372881354
