8186837,5,B000OV7QMK,"IF YOU ARE A RAPHAEL FAN AND OLD MOVIES, THIS IS ONE SURELY TO GET. FOR A MOVIE FROM THE 60'S THE QUALITY IS GREAT.",1225584000,2,115,3.64
8186838,3,B000OV7QMK,"I saw this movie in a movie theater back in the 60's when it first came out, but I couldn't remember much of it.  I simply bought it just to reminisce my youth.  If you like Raphael, you'll probably like the movie because of the songs.  The story is too simple: perhaps it would be helpful if they could remaster this and other movies in Spanish as many others in English have been done.",1222387200,4,387,4.202702702702703
8186839,5,B000OV7QMK,"THIS IS A GREAT CLASSIC BY THE SPANISH SINGER RAPHAEL. IT WAS MADE IN THE LATE 60'S AND IT BRINGS BACK SOME OF MY BETTER MEMORIES OF MY YOUTH.
OUTSTANDING MUSIC AND SOME PRETTY GOOD ACTING IF I MY SAY SO MYSELF!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!",1215216000,4,233,4.2
