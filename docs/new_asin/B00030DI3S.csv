8035736,3,B00030DI3S,"The copy (VHS) was poorly reproduced in that it was so dense that the night scenes were almost total darkness, showing only vaguely defined movement even though the sound was clear. I get better recordings off the air.",1125619200,13,218,4.7631578947368425
8035737,3,B00030DI3S,"Scarecrow and Mrs. King was not an award winning drama show, but it was good fun for the whole family and is child friendly.  Mrs. King is an average homemaker and mother of two boys, who accidentally becomes involved with a spy (Scarecrow). She eventually becomes a real agent and always gets them into trouble. Btw, Bruce Boxleitner is a pleasure to look at!",1124409600,15,360,4.625
