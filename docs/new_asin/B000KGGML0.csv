8156671,2,B000KGGML0,"I purchased this course - all 4 DVDs for over $200, thinking it would teach me something. Well, unfortunately, besides brushing up on some old fundamentals it disappointed me. Definitely not worth $200 in my opinion...but I will let you be the judge of that.

Further ""Dislikes"":

1. He ""mimes"" to try sync with his pre-recorded voice narration, without
  much success. Get's a bit irritating after a while (remember the old
  Eastern Kungfu movies?)
2. His mixture of English words does not go well with his strong foreign
  accent. This, at times, makes it difficult to follow what he is saying
  especially when he uses ""tech words"" that newbies won't have heard
  before.
3. He spends too much time explaining basic concepts, without getting
  into the the actual material enough.
4. The examples on screen are often cut off, which means you cannot follow
  what he is explaining as you cannot see the examples.
5. He, at times, makes mistakes at the command line, but does not always
  correct them, which leaves you guessing what is correct - unless you
  knew better yourself.

Having been through 3 of the 4 discs (couldn't push myself any further than disc 3), I gave up. Other CBT Unix / Linux training that I do recommend (over Boris' course) are those offered by CBT Nuggets and LinuxCBT. That and a few good Unix/Linux books will get you far more productive in the Unix/Linux World.

For those wanting a very ""Basic Intro"" into Unix, then stick with Boris.",1198886400,,1469,4.723320158102767

The course happened to be very helpful. You're getting the entire prospective and learn in two-three days things that would be very time consuming otherwise .

This course is what it claims to be: the solid, comprehensive course for the beginner and a guide to UNIX workflow. I purchased this course along with some books on UNIX and have to admit that it is SO MUCH easier to follow the DVD course. To mention I liked my diplomas very much and framed both.

I'm 38 years old and despite I had some general computer experience it was my first venture into such sophisticated thing as UNIX is and for most it had passed smoothly. There are some things that I worked out for three times and some that I collected from the single pass but the overall impression this course had made is positive and productive

Learning UNIX/Linux for a beginner is a huge challenge as it is so comprehensive, implies familiarity with many details, and requires understanding of numerous concepts. There are many books on the subject but near all of them are difficult to penetrate and usually there's huge gap between theory you learn and the ability to apply that theory in practice. So many books I have tried happened to be too simplistic to be useful or too heavy. I would agree that average book on unix isn't necessarily has to be page turner but in general it is difficult to get unix out of printed page. It normally and traditionally has to be learned on some training courses because the commands have to be tried as you learn and so on. I found it to be boring to read then to type then to read again. I can do it for 5 pages not for 250 pages course book. Not anymore.

This DVD course shows all the stuff in action. It teaches all the necessary concepts and closes the gaps with immediate examples, commands, on screen illustrations etc. This course takes a beginner into much revered advanced level by some very easy to follow lessons. Generally speaking, learning from this DVD is a pleasure. I found this course to be so helpful and another included course ""TCP/IP and UNIX Networking"" reinforced that impression. Many people admire the DVDs as a very efficient shortcut into UNIX technologies and opportunity for jobs that would be hardly attainable otherwise.
The magic of the video is that he knows the precise path to put you on as he is aware on every point what may impose a difficulty and explains all the major ideas before you hit them. No doubt it is not an exhaustive training on UNIX but there's hardly anything that can be. This DVD course provides an immeasurable advantage though: it takes virtually complete dummy out of the street and in some two, three days in ""follow me"" style makes this newbie speaking professional terms, using advanced commands and performing complex tasks. This course, as you will discover it suddenly, has another very important side effect it will make possible to you following some quite sophisticated technical books with relative ease. I had some books on UNIX, networking, shells etc. and simply could not force myself going over couple of pages before putting them aside and today I can read them normally.

I also asked some questions Boris himself and it is nice he addresses the questions personally, help and cares. My general impression is ""Very Nice"".",1174953600,2,3712,5.037459283387622
