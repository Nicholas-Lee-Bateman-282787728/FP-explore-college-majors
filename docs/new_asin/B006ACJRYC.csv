8495764,5,B006ACJRYC,"On the surface, this is deeply flawed; there's some awkward dialogue, Harvey Kietel is OK, not amazing, the female characters are thin.  But it's so damn full of breathtaking images, brave cinematic choices, multi-minute long shots, and a heart rending climax, that the flaws don't seem important some how. The story: A Greek film director caught in his own mid-life artistic and personal crisis goes on an odyssey to find lost footage by Greece's first filmmakers, traveling through the Balkans and revisiting his own life in the process.  I can certainly understand the mixed reviews.  This isn't an easy film, and if watched in the wrong mood, or without knowing what you're getting into (a slow, thoughtful 3 hour rumination on life, the past and art) could be very off-putting.  But accepted on its own terms, warts and all it's an amazing odyssey; visual, emotional and thematic.

If you can, find a copy of this on the Greek 'New Star' DVD line.  All those transfers were made more recently, and were personally supervised by Angelopoulos, leading to a significant image improvement. Sadly, those discs were only out a short while, and now can be very difficult to locate.",1438992000,,1179,4.929292929292929
