I have been a Field's fan my whole life, but, am not likely to purchase any description-less video! Between the content mystery and the low price, this must be a real classic - NOT!",1202342400,19,322,4.209677419354839

8236784,1,B00102F61A,I have to agree with most everyone else. To put this out without listing the films on the DVD is lame. Criterion has already released the 6 sound shorts in as good condition as one could hope for.,1203033600,2,196,4.184210526315789
8236785,1,B00102F61A,"""Signature Collection"" sounds very cool, very 'official,' very...signatur-ish. The value of a signature is the character of the person that wrote it. We have nothing of substance here.",1202860800,2,184,5.607142857142857

My problem is less with the product (after all, for $4, what could one reasonably expect?); the problem is with Amazon.  They will not read the reviews and, therefore, will not respond.  They clutter up my inbox with solicitations but don't review their own product before putting it in the market.

Caveat emptor.  Let the buyer beware.  I would give the product no stars because, essentially, there is no product.  However, apparently, the process will not permit me to leave zero stars.  All that we know is that there is a bonus of the very early silent one-reeler, Pool Sharks, which most of have already.  It is incumbent upon Amazon to describe the product with enough specificity to elicit substantive reviews.  All of us are saying the same thing: at the moment, this DVD is a grab-bag because we have not been informed as to that which is inside.

We all love Fields or we wouldn't be taking the time to write.  if you choose to buy this DVD, you will be paying for an unknown -- period.  I wouldn't.",1202774400,7,1067,4.5
8236787,1,B00102F61A,"I got the same e-mail recommending this one as I had bought one of the excellent Universal collections. My guess is this will include The Golf Specialist, The Fatal Glass of Beer, The Dentist and the box cover already says The Pool Sharks which are PD shorts that have been available for decades. Check the distributor and the price. $3.98?? I checked 4 or 5 other websites and they had no description either. I can't even find it on the St. Clair website! Why does Amazon waste my time like this?",1202774400,6,497,4.472527472527473
8236788,2,B00102F61A,"The print at the bottom of the box names a bonus film on the CD as Pool Sharks. Pool Sharks, W.C. Fields first film, was shot in 1915. A silent film, perhaps the inspiration for the silent description of the rest of the movies. Fields and his rival (Bud Ross) are both in love with the same girl. They are constantly fighting over her. After disrupting a picnic, they decide to settle their dispute with a game of pool. After some trick photography pool shots  they end up breaking pool sticks over each other's heads and throwing pool balls at each other. In the end, the girl spurns them both. Fields was wearing a fake-looking moustache and acting more like Charlie Chaplin than his later, well-known personality from sound comedies. If you are a Fields fan and don't have his first film, (remember it is a silent film) the price should be worth it even if you already own the other movies.",1202774400,5,893,4.512345679012346

8236790,1,B00102F61A,"Great Title! I like WC Fields Movies, however, what is this?  Where's the description?  Its 2/7/2008, I get an email about the DVD to be released on the 19th and I don't know what it is.  Am I the only one that feels this way or what? Again, great title and it got my attention so until I know what is on the DVD, I just might buy it.",1202342400,10,334,3.8115942028985508
