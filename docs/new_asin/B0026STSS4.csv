8353600,5,B0026STSS4,"This DVD provides a remarkable opportunity to see some of the greatest and most legendary Russian rock artists, both in performance and in their off-stage lives. Yuri Shevchuk (DDT), perhaps the greatest Russian rock songwriter - and certainly a courageously outspoken artist from the Soviet era to the present (Google his confrontation with Vladimir Putin to learn more) - is shown as a gentle and loving soul with his family, working by day as a building maintenance man - and then he rocks the Leningrad Rock Club with an intensity that is spine tingling to witness. Incredible!

That would be enough - but the film also shows Victor Tsoi (Kino), working in the infamous boiler room - then rocking out. BG (Boris Grebenshchikov)/Aqvarium gets excellent coverage, as do other performers, as well. The cinematography is artful.

Included is a rare chance to see  Alexander Bashlachev perform. A ""bard"" poet/rock singer, often compared with Dostoevsy, he would sadly commit suicide a few years later when the muse abandoned him. Whatever you do, don't turn off your machine when the credits start to roll, as there is an additional separate short subject film in homage to Bashlachev which immediately follows. It is quite moving.

This is a PAL format DVD, unfortunately, limiting the number of people who can view it; and there are no subtitles. Still, I highly recommend this to anyone interested in Soviet/Russian ROCK (not pop!) music. You don't have to speak Russian to realize you are seeing exceptional performances. Borrow a PAL player, if you can, and enjoy the show.",1296864000,2,1577,5.030651340996169
