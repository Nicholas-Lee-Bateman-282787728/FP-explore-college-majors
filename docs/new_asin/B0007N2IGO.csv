3144393,5,B0007N2IGO,"Since my daily work involves HD, I am not easily impressed when it comes to quality footage. I was skeptical when it came to these ""living art"" DVD's, but decided to go ahead and purchase HD Window. When I got home and put it into my player and checked it out I was blown away. I had never seen HD come across this crisp from a DVD before. It definitely surprised me and impressed the various people who have visited my place. They always comment about how breathtaking it is. I saw a reviewer state that this was a waste of money and it is not worth $10. As someone who works day in and day out in HD, this is a bargain. I've seen people shell out hundreds of dollars for less content in order to do what this DVD does. I look forward to viewing the future volumes.",1118102400,2,766,4.113333333333333
3144394,5,B0007N2IGO,"I have been watching this on my 61"" HDTV and it looks fantastic! The DVD has a lot of beach scenes and some of rivers and a beautiful scene of a rainforest waterfall. The audio on the DVD is  in surround sound of the waves crashing and birds chirpping - it's almost like being right on the beach. I put it on when I have parties to create a nice ambiance. It's a great DVD to show off my home theatre system. There is also a menu choice on the DVD that puts the moving video scenery in a picture frame right on my TV - it looks pretty cool!",1118016000,3,540,3.909090909090909
3144395,1,B0007N2IGO,"Please do not buy this DVD.  I was so disappointed and hurt for spending this much on this DVD.  The video consist of a few ugly screen shots of Hawaii scenaries.  I was suprised that someone would make such a video and sell it at such a price.  A few positive things are the quality of the image was okay, good music, and has a high def disc playable on PC.  However, the content is not worth the money.  I would not even pay 10 bucks for this set had I known.  HD window can be certained that I will not buy their next series and so will whoever bought volume one. Thanks for reviewing.",1117843200,4,588,4.060869565217391

8258262,2,B0007N2IGO,"This DVD just does not fit in whatever written on its cover. Apart from a few shots, scenery is not good enough. I am sure if it was carefully thought and locations were properly selected, this could have been the best WMVHD DVD, unfortunately, at the moment its not.",1151971200,,267,4.469387755102041
8258263,3,B0007N2IGO,"The idea of an HDTV ""window"" is great.

It's true that starting at 1280x720, I can effortlessly look through the image and let me immerse into the scenery while viewing SD was rather ""looking at a projected image"".

Unfortunately, the sound doesn't always fit the image, and more sadly, the disc is not full at all, a 500 Mb short WMV version of the film trying to make it worth the price.

However, this is a nice demo to let run on a wall or on a big screen while you're having your breakfast ;-)",1141689600,,498,4.221052631578948
8258264,1,B0007N2IGO,"I sure love my WMVHD DVD's but this one just does not cut it!  Not sure what cammera they were using but I've seen much better resolution on all my other wmvhd dvd's than this one. I ran it on my 50"" plasma and it looked ""ok"", but once I sent it out to my Sony Ruby sxrd projector on a 12ft screen you really can see how poor the resolution is in this. Way to long was spent on each scene, man.. turned it off after 15 min.",1136592000,4,423,3.752808988764045
8258265,5,B0007N2IGO,"As a home theater buff i must say that HD Window is a great addition to my WMVHD collection. The images are well composed and of the utmost quality. It is the perfect accessory for my 50"" plasma above my mantel. The concept of living landscape art is brilliantly presented in this dvd by shots of 2 min durations connected by an approximate 10 sec transition shot. This gives you the time to  enjoy the image as you would a painting or a photograph. The standard definition disc also has a great looking frame or matte that you can add to the images. This really turns the plasma into a framed piece of art above my fireplace. Put it on during a recent party at the house-everyone enjoyed it and it wasn't a distraction but a conversation piece!

 I have been to Hawaii many times and recognize many of the places. The islands are so diverse its great to see other images besides the obvious beaches. The surround track is great - I love the music and the fact that I can choose just to hear natural sounds only

 I recommend this DVD to anyone who has an HD display. I take it to the office and play it on my laptop during lunch. Can't wait for the next one!!",1126569600,4,1160,4.254545454545455
8258266,2,B0007N2IGO,"I purchased the ""HD Window Hawaii"" DVD at the same time that I purchased the ""Waves: The Best Caribbean Beaches"" DVD.  I have been looking for relaxation DVDs that focus on tropical islands for a long time.  I have viewed both DVDs numerous times on both my 51"" HDTV and my digital editing PC.  I would like to provide some of my thoughts on both DVDs.

When strictly comparing the video quality of the two DVDs, the HD Hawaii DVD wins out, especially when viewing it in true HD on my computer.  But that should be expected since it was filmed in HD.  If all you are looking for is HD video and you don't care about value-added content or production value, by all means order the HD Window Hawaii DVD.  However, I don't think the HD video comes close to making up for issues that I think detract from the value of this product.  This DVD has too many transitions, and doesn't focus on one relaxing scene for long enough, in my opinion.  The camera changes from one scene to another too frequently and too soon.  I was hoping for long, relaxing, soothing scenes of the waves crashing onto the shore with maybe a few other pretty scenes mixed in (but mostly I wanted waves).  The producers of this DVD tried to mix in way too many ""destination"" and ""nature"" scenes.  I bought this video as a relaxation tool, not a travel guide.  I wanted the quintessential views of Hawaii's coastlines and the nature sounds that make them so appealing and relaxing.  Instead, I found myself watching a couple minutes here and there of superfluous nature scenes that could have been filmed anywhere in the world.  There are way too many scenes that do not look uniquely like Hawaii.

I prefer the scenes in the ""Waves: Best Caribbean Beaches"" DVD and find it to be more focused on the wave action, which is what I bought these DVDs for anyway.  The HD Hawaii DVD has too many cuts and scene changes, and many scenes that really just don't belong.  Seriously, who needs to see five minutes of water lilies in a pond with fake wave effects in the background?  The Waves DVD is nothing but long shots of beautiful beach scenes with waves washing ashore.  You get to see six beautiful islands on six different days in a sequence that takes you from sunrise to sunset.  This is exactly what I was looking for.

I also prefer the audio in the Waves DVD over the HD Hawaii DVD.  The Waves audio wasn't in surround sound (which I would like, but I understand the technical difficulties behind recording real-life surround sound), but at least the wave effects were more realistic than in the HD Hawaii DVD.  I was very turned off by the out-of-synch and faked attempt at surround sound on the HD Hawaii DVD.  It is very obvious that the wave sound effects were not from the actual waves you're watching on your screen.  The HD Hawaii DVD has many, many, many scenes where the audio does not fit with the video.  No joke, there is a scene of a big tree at the base of one of the volcanoes out in the middle of a flat field and there are the sounds of huge crashing waves!  There isn't a single drop of water anywhere in sight, yet is sounds like you're in a pipeline on Oahu's north shore!  There are some beautiful beach scenes in the HD Hawaii video with some lovely DTS 5.1 wave effects, but it is obvious the sound is dubbed in.  There are scenes where you see huge crashing waves, but the audio sounds like little, tiny waves lapping on the pebbles on the shore.  There are other scenes where there are just a few lapping waves, but it once again sounds like Oahu's north shore during on a windy day!  There was even one scene where I was watching some awesome waves crashing to shore when the audio suddenly went completely silent for a couple seconds.  Then the audio loop of crashing waves started all over.

After comparing the two DVDs, I give HD Hawaii positives for the HD video, the anamorphic widescreen and an attempt at 5.1 audio.  However, I give it negatives for too many scene transitions, to many ""fluff"" scenes and an obviously faked sound track.

Unfortunately, the Waves DVD is in full-screen rather than widescreen and is not in surround sound.  However, the beautiful content and true-to-life audio more than make up for the DVD's faults.  When I watch the DVD on my HDTV in 4:3 Expanded mode (sides stretched but center is 1:1), I am completely unable to tell that the video is not anamorphic widescreen.  The picture is very crisp, clean and soothing to my eyes.  Even though the audio is not 5.1 surround, I'd rather have Dolby Digital stereo of the REAL wave sounds than faked 5.1 waves any day!  Not to mention that the Waves DVD can be had for more than half the price of the HD Hawaii DVD.  Also, I have read and heard that the ""Waves"" DVD series will soon start producing HD video!!  I will wait for that and steer clear of the ""HD Window"" DVD series.",1124841600,9,4857,4.434537246049661

8258268,1,B0007N2IGO,"I've been to Hawaii, and this material does not reflect the marvellous and spectacular landscape of those islands. Moreover, the DVD is too expensive as compared to other WMVHD editions.",1123027200,5,186,5.233333333333333
8258269,4,B0007N2IGO,"The quality of the picture is excellent, the backgound music is relaxing. But the DVD cover mentioned with DTS 5.1, it seems not, I can't play with DTS and neither in my friend's AV system. The movement of the scene is a bit slow make it looks boring. Overall it is satifactory, especially you want to test your AV system and your LCD or Plasma flat screen TV.",1121990400,,360,4.3088235294117645
8258270,5,B0007N2IGO,I just bought a brand new HD plasma and I cannot think of anything that is more complementary to it than HD Hawaii.  It gives true meaning to Higher Definition.  The compulation of shots and 5.1 digital sounds gives you the visualization and sensations of being in Hawaii.  Problem I have with the DVD is that I cannot find anything else that even comes close to picture and sound quality.  Just curious when part 2 is comming out?,1121817600,,431,4.487179487179487
8258271,5,B0007N2IGO,I love the functionality of this video!!  It works well in my front office and is a wonderful asthetic at my gatherings at home.  I can't wait to see some new volumes of this spectacular video!  I am amazed at the picture quality from WMVHD.  It shocking that it all fits onto a DVD playable on my PC at home.  Pick this one up!,1118275200,,328,4.0625
