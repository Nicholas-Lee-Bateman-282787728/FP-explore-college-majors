  You can feel clearly in the DVD how this fantastic artist brings the audience together and you can notice how the temperature goes up during each song, that makes an initially quiet audience turn into a vibrant and amazed crowd.

  The song selection is excelent, the band is a show itself and the arrangements are creative and in despite of being world wide known Lenine keeps his influences and explores a variety of rhythms and musical languages that define him like a unique talent.

  Owner of all languages,attentive to this and other worlds,

Lenine incite is a delight!",1133568000,2,774,4.583941605839416

The cuban bass player girl and the argentinian percussionnist were fantastic either. And Lenine voice  and energy at the top.

You must see that in DVD to believe it !",1124928000,,342,4.2
