ISIS: they are the worlds most feared terrorist group.  [This is] the story of where they came from, how they waged war for more than a decade, [and] the failure of two American presidents [to stop them].

The above is said by the narrator at the beginning of this revealing, powerful documentary.

This is an episode of Frontline that was aired on television on May 17, 2016.  Frontline is a critically-acclaimed, award-winning, public affairs television program that produces and broadcasts in-depth documentaries.

Before this film begins, were told that Tonights program contains graphic images of war.  Viewer discretion is advised.  (Theyre not kidding about the graphic images!)

This documentary investigates the inside political story of how the American invasion of Iraq (initiated by 9/11) and the decisions of two presidents (Bush Jr, and Obama) helped to lay the groundwork for ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) to grow into, as the above extract states, the worlds most feared terrorist group.

It shows how a one-time thug was able to outmaneuver the American government to build a brutal terrorist organization that not only destabilized the Middle East but inflicted global violence (including in Paris and Brussels).  (This thug who later became known as The Sheikh of the Slaughterers has his picture shown on the front of the DVD case displayed above by Amazon.)

This film uses plenty of archival footage.  It draws on documents as well as on twenty interviews with major policymakers including former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and numerous journalists, authors, and counterterrorism experts.

Finally, this documentary ends on a chilling note.  We are told that ISIS has promised that the worst is yet to come.

In conclusion, this film is essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand how ISIS came to be, and how they got to where they are now.

(2016;  53 min excluding end credits;  wide screen;  English subtitles;  Frontline;  PBS)
