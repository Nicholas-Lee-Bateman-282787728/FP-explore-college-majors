8728597,1,B013ROX4DA,Very poor edit & control of the music... some portions of the video had music that was so loud the narration could not be heard or understood. I am surprised that Amazon allowed something of this poor quality control & editing be sold under their name! I am NOT referring to the video or filming... strictly the narration that was added as the videos were being produced!,1533081600,,371,4.552238805970149
