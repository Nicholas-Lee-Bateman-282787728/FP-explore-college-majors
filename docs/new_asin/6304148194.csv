8278575,2,6304148194,"This video seems to have been made to cash on Mr. Malakhov's rising reputation as an international star. The plot follows Shakespeare's play, but many secondary characters and incidents have been ommitted. The sets and costumes are poor. Mr. Malakhov's tight metallic leoptard outrageously emphasizes his private parts! A rather poor actor, his Hamlet has neither anguish nor depth. The other dancers - all unknown to me - are pedestrian and the choreography (?) is second-rate.
The score uses Shostakovitch's music for the film ""Hamlet"", plus selections from some of his string quartets.
Lasting less than an hour, I would recommend it only for die-hard fans of Mr. Malakov.",1043107200,,675,5.201834862385321
