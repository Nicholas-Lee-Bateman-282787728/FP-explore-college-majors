8112808,1,B000EQ46OG,"I came across this little ""gem"" when I was watching another movie on VHS, apparently one of my friends was an extra in this. I was given insight that this is an independent ""film maker"" that likes to make movies in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

First off, where to start with this movie. This movie really tries to be an epic adventure of a sadistic man planning on destroying the world. But where this movie falls short is everything else that any normal person would classify as normal film making.

After a couple minutes into the film you can already assume that this was made on a very limited, if any, budget. Acting is horrible and at most times laughable. Scenes go on wayyy too long than needed. And the special effects make 1970 B-movies look good.

But the major flaw in this trash of a movie is the character development. The only real character development that happens is the director/terrorist that goes from crazy to more crazy without any motivation behind his actions besides to make a more ""realistic"" movie. He builds an army to take over Tulsa which consists of stretch yellow hummers and bikers from off the street.

Of course one has to think, if this guy blows up a city to make a good movie in his eyes, who would watch such a thing? Which also had me questioning why I was watching this movie for anything other than a good laugh. But wait, the director has a ""friend"" that is writing the chronicles of the story of whom which is by-far the worst actor in the movie. He sits and talks to himself of what he is writing with no inner character monologue, no character development, and from numerous closeups on the ashtray and cigarette he has...he apparently smokes like a chimney but not once will it shows him actually smoking the cigarette. Needless characters and long extended stock footage of the american army quickly follows.

It's very difficult to actually review a movie this horrible without pinpointing all the things wrong with it.

But after we got through laughing through this movie I was told that he purposely throws a film together quickly and sells it with a good dvd cover to get people to buy the film without actually seeing it beforehand. And that most of his time goes into the creation of the cover than the movie itself so people will be more tempted to buy it.

Oh and if you're wondering about Evan Marriott in the film since he's listed in big bold letters on the cover...he's in one speaking part in the film and 2 or 3 quick shots. Even though he is listed as the major actor in the film on the cover. Just to show you on how the director wants to con people into thinking it stars him.

Anyways, please do not buy this movie. I personally could make a better movie with my cellphone camera and anyone watching this could say the same.

BTW, Amazon won't let me rate this as 0 stars so take the 1 star rating as being kind.",1179619200,2,2869,4.459923664122138
