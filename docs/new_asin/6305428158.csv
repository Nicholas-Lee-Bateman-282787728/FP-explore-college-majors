1036827,5,6305428158,"Actually, this is one of the better Steven Seagal movies to come along in quite a while. While I generally like his movies (he's a sort of ""Thinking Man's Rambo"") quite a bit; nevertheless, I sometimes get a wee bit tired of him interjecting his politics & personal beliefs into these films. Movies such as ""On Deadly Ground"" (about fighting bad guys & oil well fires up in Alaska, starring Michael Caine, as well) are a good example of what I'm talking about. Seagal could've left the whole ""Eskimo Spirit World thing"" completely out of that film & it would've actually made a much better movie, I think. However, his views and portrayals on biological warfare testing & the government actually fit in quite well with this film. And although it was (VERY) loosely based on William Heine's novel ""The Last Canadian""; other than dealing with a man-made plague that was intentionally set loose, it has almost nothing in common with Heine's book. When someone says ""based on the novel..."" or ""based on the book by 'so & so'..."", you've got to take that bit of info with a very ""large grain of salt"", so-to-speak!
Nevertheless, this is one movie that was quite entertaining and VERY well acted - by virtually everyone in the film - not just Seagal himself. Well worth the purchase price, I think!",1411689600,4,1292,4.6960352422907485

It was well made and not boring, even though it can hardly be considered a typical Steven Seagal action film. The film works in that it is well acted and has an interesting storyline.

1037180,3,6305428158,"Seagal was tempted once more to recreate ""On Deadly Ground"" It seems he really has a thing for being the environmental hero; and sure the intentions may be good, but the movies themselves aren't. This flick has the same feel of both ""On Deadly Ground"", and ""Fire Down Below"" only weaker. I mean Fire Down Below was a good excuse for the dreadful On Deadly Ground...why keep re visiting similar plots.

Seagal this time around plays Dr. Wesley McClaren, A local Doctor that is well respected in his town. Shortly in the film we are introduced to a Militia- Extremist; he and his men want to teach the government a lesson. The leader of the militia decides to use his body as a vessel for a biochemical disease. He ingests the disease, whoever gets in contact with him they will obviously get infected, and whoever gets in contact with the other infected...the will also get the disease, and etc. McClaren, who was once C.I.A operative, is called in to help investigate and find a cure to create a vaccine before more get infected. McClaren will do the impossible to find the cure and take down the enemy.

The idea of an ""invisible"" threat is good, but this movie doesn't feel like a movie for Seagal; it should have been given to someone else like Charles Bronson (who was alive at the time) also there really isn't any action in this movie; many complain about that, personally I think it was a good choice because the story doesn't really match with martial arts. one thing that for sure kills the movie is the resolution; after they find the cure (which are flowers) they spread the cure from helicopters all over the town...that's really frooty. I guess its ok to watch, but now own

1037181,4,6305428158,"Even with two environmentally-charged vehicles behind him, Steven Seagal wasn't quite done with his eco-trip, and his following project was the self-financed adaptation of William Heine's post-apocalyptic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Canadian/dp/0770100155/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Canadian</a>. The film marked Seagal's first entry into the direct-to-video market and is generally not held in high regard by fans, but as someone who doesn't mind a green message or toning down the action content every once in a while, this is one of my personal favorites of what Seagal has to offer.

When Floyd Chisolm (Gailard Sartain,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ernest-Goes-to-Jail/dp/B000065V3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ernest Goes to Jail</a>) - the leader of a violent militia - unleashes a devastating virus upon the population of the town and topples an intervening response team, Wesley must engineer an antidote to the virus before it's too late.

For all non-canon purposes, ""The Patriot"" could be the third installment in Seagal's line of movies that include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Deadly-Ground/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Deadly Ground</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-Down-Below/dp/6304707622/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire Down Below</a>. It's not as overtly environmentally-themed as those two, but the power of the Earth is definitely represented. Those familiar with Seagal's filmography will realize that this type of approach calls for a reduction of adrenaline scenes: flower-power is played over arm-breaking and neck-snapping (although Steven does score a nifty kill with a wine glass), so for those of you who won't be able to live without the violence of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-for-Justice/dp/0790740834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out for Justice</a>&nbsp;should steer clear.

Those of you who stick around, however, are treated to a direct-to-video film that's miles ahead of anything Seagal would make later in his career under the same label. First-time director Dean Semler manages the picture with dutiful attention to detail, and the script calls for plenty of meaningful character interaction - the kind where even bit players are given an endearing personality. The cast is one of the most underrated of any Seagalian picture: Sartain, Jones, Belle, and Whitney Yellow Robe as Wesley's assistant all share an enthusiasm for their roles that defies non-theatrical expectations, and even Steven manages a little something extra for his character, especially when interacting with his daughter.

Where the film's faults are concerned, the lack of Seagal's bread-and-butter moves (i.e. bone breaking) comes to weigh on even my mind, though the story is generally successful in avoiding situations where it would be necessary. In addition, Sartain's militia-leading character is portrayed strangely: I can't help but think that the voiceover referring to him as neo Nazi was inserted solely because the filmmakers feared his anti-government ideology might end up appealing to some viewers. Still, I like the movie a lot, and I'm still unsure of why so many folks don't. I mean, who can't appreciate Seagal rocking a cowboy hat? If you ask me, any real fan of the aikido master would be daft to put any of his lesser DTV titles on their shelf before this one.",1211155200,5,4080,6.885880077369439

It had a story line that was different for him and showed him as a father and a doctor -not the old CIA or EX CIA operative. He wasn't an assassin or a cop. He was a doctor. soo his character didn't need to kill everyone he needed to find a cure and keep his daughter safe. I liked the movie a lot BECAUSE it showed him in a different role and not the same type of character he usually plays. Give the guy a break!

I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal plays a doctor who cares more about helping his patients get well than he does getting paid, not just because he gives both the government officials and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American traditions and healing methods play in this film.

Maybe for all those things.  Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it adds a dimension to his character that makes this more than just an action movie.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of enemies to defeat here, and Seagal defeats them all -- including the 'invisible enemy' of biochemical disease.  Not bad, not bad at all.  Better than good in fact.

1037219,3,6305428158,"The Patriot is Stevens first DTV. I can see why it was not in the movies, but that should not stop you from seeing this movie. The plot is basically Steven is a local doctor in the town and he is very respected. He has a daughter maybe between the ages of 8-10. They have a little farm with horses. Now a bad guy who seemed to me like an EX millitary agent or officer turned anti american. Before he helped creat a drug that could easily wipe out an entire town within hours and the stuff is VERY deadly! Well he figures if he is going to go down, then why not take as many people down with him as possible. He puts a couple of drops on his tongue and goes to court to face his sentence. He then spits on the judge and from then on the judge passes it on and so forth. Steven is not a police officer or millitary or anything. Just a very smart doctor. Now he is called into action when the bad guy excapes from jail and goes to the hopsital and basically hold the place hostage until a cure can be found. and yes he does want it for himself and his soldiers. From  then on the story happens and comes to an end. From what I said above in the short summary there is more detail, im just going to let you watch the movie.

The acting is good to me. Steven has some funny one liners here and there. And the bad guy makes a beleivable bad guy. Not just some pethetic looser who trys to be scary but fails. The supporting cast is good. Because this is a Steven Seagal film im sure EVERYONE is wanting to see some good action because he is still in shape here. You might be dissapointed. Out of 90 minutes, I would say about 10 mins of action. But I must say for the 10 mins of action it is descent enough to make you smile. The ending to me was not good at all. It seemed to ""NICE"" to me. But hey they all cant be good. The Patriot is Rated ""R"" for Strong Violence and Language. Keep in mind that this is a DTV and not a theatrical release.

However, the world isn't Earth, because it'd never happen in such a ridiculous way on Earth. For example, at one point the good guys want to distribute a helpful substance to the population. So do they package it in bags and hand it out, or have people come to a station to pick some up? No, they sprinkle it across the town from a helicopter. Good idea!
There's almost no subtlety in this film, even when it's really called for. No plot twist comes off as inventive or even interesting, and many outcomes are very easily guessed. There was one moment of anticipation that turned out opposite from how you'd expect, but even that was just sort of cheesy. Character development is pretty much limited to identifying which stereotype a person falls into (disgruntled idealist, concerned doctor, wise native, etc), so that without plot or characters, action is left as the selling point of the film. The action's almost non-existant, and very sporadic. It more or less consists of Seagal occasionally needing to distract a person, grab their gun, and knock them unconscious. And finally, the film's dramatic scenes are poorly done, as they're either really standard and not very forceful at all, or they're done in a strange way that minimizes their effect (for example a potentially thought-provoking scene at the end that's just sort of done in a sappy way).

This movie starts out where real life left off, except that it depicts the Montana militia as murdering right-wing (naturally!) misfits instead of the more-or-less justified protesters they really were.

In this one, there is a mixed message: First you have the idealistic doctor (Steven Seagal) who has left the government apparently because they were developing ""biological weapons"" (germ warfare) which he protested--a favorite theme of the ""good guys"" on the political left.  Then, you have the dirty rotten right-wing militia who have obtained a virus that is ""ten times stronger than anthrax.""  Of course, they immediately infect the whole countryside with it.

Then, the right-wing radical rednecks come into town in their camos and shoot everyone in sight, trying to get the antidote for the virus which--surprise!--has also infected them.

The doctor escapes with his cute little daughter (whose blood the brutes want to make an antidote) and tries to find a vaccine and save the world.
Not content with the propaganda they have dished out so far, the producers then throw in a dose of the piece de resistance, the under-appreciated, misunderstood ""Native American,"" whose natural remedy saves the day.

A tour de force of Hollywood liberal propaganda.  The acting is under par, except for the old veteran actor, L.Q. Jones.

Steven Seagal tends to throw several unnecessary factors into his movies.  ""The Glimmer Man"" is an action-packed-with-""Seven""-like-thriller movie, and his debut as a director ""One Deadly Ground"" is about a guy who literally fights for the Earth's environment.  Now again we see in ""The Patriot"" a misguided idea of putting lethal virus, militia, and martial arts together.  So in ""The Patriot"" you will see Seagal a) look through a microscope; b) ride a horse; c) break a wineglass and a bad guy's neck too.  How can you put these incongruous things into order?  And as for virus, some people find the ending of ""The Outbreak"" not convincing enough; they will change their mind after watching the incredible conclusion of ""The Patriot,"" which remains secret for your unexpected joy.
The film's saving grace comes from the beautiful shot of landscape in Montana.  The director is Dean Semler, who is awarded Oscar for cinematography of ""Dances with Wolves,"" but I don't think the beautiful backdrop is what you want here.

This defies belief, that subsequent to a film like The Patriot, which was released straight onto video and HBO, a movie starring Steven Seagul could earn money.

The Patriot is undoubtedly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Everything concerning its existence is wrong.

The acting is bad, even by B-movie standards (C-movie anyone?); half the movie presents us with endless fields rather than action or anything to further the extremely thin and laughable plot (almost non-existent); the cure for the plague had me reeling for laughter (how could any studio accept this film?), the totally illogical occurrences and ridiculous actions by numerous characters leaves one in tears, the scenes are disjointed and form an incoherent, implausible and almost stress-inducing collage of tripe which does not in any way connect to form a watchable film; the stale, prosaic idiocy of the whole thing is mind-numbing; when characters die, there is no sentimental attachment to them whatsoever despite the obviously inadquate director's and writer's efforts; the viewer can actually see through the transparent facade and see how they are being manipulated by this highly contrived material that suits people with an IQ that could be mistaken for a shoe size...
