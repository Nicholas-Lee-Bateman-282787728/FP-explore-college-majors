5322255,5,B009E8C05M,"Here's what I love about this DVD:
* Each yoga story starts & ends in the same way. This predictability is great for young kids.
* Jaime has a high energy level and is fun and engaging. Who else could rock a pink adult onesie?
* Great creative storytelling.
* Incorporates familiar songs & other singing as she does poses. This is a great way to tap into multiple learning styles!
* Cute animated backgrounds. I like the new under the sea background on Squish the Fish compared to the Youtube version.
* Lots of repetition of poses in each story and across the stories. This is great for young kids.
* Fun variations on poses! Great kid-friendly take on sun salutations. I got lots of new ideas for my OMazing Kids classes
* Incorporates kid-friendly messages about being brave, focused & friendly. Love the message in Kickapoo the Kangaroo.... ""get to know people before making a judgement about them""!
* Brief Savasana relaxation at the end of each yoga story.
* Easy to navigate intro screen on the DVD would make it easy for kids to select the yoga story they want.

The only suggestion I have for improvement is that the pace is a bit fast at times. The fast pace will be great to give kids a way to work off extra energy. However, it could be difficult for some kids with special needs or slow processing to keep up. Some kids with Autism Spectrum Disorders or Sensory Processing Disorder could become overwhelmed by the sensory input of the fast auditory input combined with an animated background.

5322256,5,B009E8C05M,"These yoga videos are a great family activity.  We have been enjoying the cosmic kids YouTube videos for several months and have been anxiously waiting for the DVD to arrive.  Cosmic Kids started, and still is, a free channel on YouTube.  This DVD is a collection of the first three yoga videos.  My boys (ages 3 and 4) both love the adventures that these 15 minute yoga sessions take you on.  My older son has ADHD and he remains focused throughout the entire session and requests that we play another.  The yoga sessions are engaging, are great exercise, has the kids laughing, and at the end has them relaxed.  These adventures do the standard yoga poses, but get the kids into the poses by blowing up hot air balloons, making their bodies their treasure chests on pirate adventures, and stretching their arms out to grab items to pack their suitcase for their adventure.  We are getting the DVD so that we can watch them on the TV and all have visibility to the screen.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1355270400,7,1003,4.558659217877095
5322257,4,B009E8C05M,"This was a great workout with my daughter. I appreciate the fast pace to keep kids attentive but I don't feel like it is very centering. I didn't feel the  thoughtful, deliberate moment and meditation that I usually get from yoga. Don't get me wrong, it was packed with tons of yoga poses...just very fast paced.  I gave it 4 stars because I enjoyed it but not 5 because I did t feel it captured the true nature of yoga and it wasn't at all what I was expecting.",1477785600,,462,4.179775280898877

5322259,2,B009E8C05M,"Of all the kid's yoga DVD's, this was our least favorite.  The instructor was grating.  She was a constant stream of verbal chatter - making the instructions too ""cluttered"".  I understand that she was trying to keep kids engaged by weaving in a story - but her zero punctuation style of talking was distracting.  Like others have said, her pacing was too quick, and she relies too heavily on her campy style (loud background, annoying heavily marketed stories like - Frozen:).  My 2.5 year old quickly lost interest.  He loved (and was able to follow) - other yoga DVDs.",1471910400,2,571,4.717171717171717
5322260,5,B009E8C05M,Jaime Amor has a rare gift for engaging the minds and creative gifts of small children.  I am as enchanted by her story telling/yoga movements as my two year old grandson.  Although he is still too young to actually follow along his attention stays engaged and he throws himself into downward facing dog as soon as he sees her.  (He had actually discovered this pose on his own as most toddlers do at some point.)  My three year old granddaughter has the same reaction to the DVD presentation and now does all of the poses with gusto.  I love the way she lets out a deep breath and says namaste at the end.  This is a great activity for child and parent together.,1468713600,2,663,4.349593495934959

5322262,5,B009E8C05M,My daughter had a lot of fun doing this video. She wanted so bad to exercise with me so I chose this as one of the videos to purchase. It is nice to hear the story as the kids do the yoga moves.,1464739200,,194,3.5348837209302326
5322263,5,B009E8C05M,My daughter loves this. She gets exercise and laughs the entire time. This video is so much fun (even for the whole family).,1459641600,,124,4.434782608695652
5322264,5,B009E8C05M,"I have been through countless kids yoga DVDs looking for one that was just right. They were all either too technical and difficult, or silly jumping/dancing with little to no yoga.
This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! My toddler isn't even quite three, but has an absolute blast with these; just big smiles and giggles the whole time.
 Each episode is a story as well as an exercise routine. I think this helps keeps kids engaged, and since there are so many episodes it doesn't become monotonous. Jaime is fantastic. High energy for kids, without being painfully annoying for the adults, lol. I'm surprised by the amount of real yoga poses she incorporates flawlessly into the stories, along with a lot of extraneous movements.
She also takes the time to explain each movement, something that seriously bugged me about some other videos. She does this so seamlessly that it doesn't detract from the story at all!
 My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that it moves VERY fast. In a way this is good, it is a really great workout. In fact, I usually do it along with my little one, and I'm almost always panting by the end. On the other hand, sometimes by the time my toddler figures out a pose, she's already moved onto the next one. This doesnt seem to upset or frustrate my child, but it might frustrate others.  Also, they obviously can't do everything yet, at least not correctly, but I think this will just keep it interesting as they get more adept, instead of  outgrowing it in a few months (as so often happens at this age).
All in all the most important thing is that my kid is getting a good workout, and learning that exercise and being healthy and active is fun. Check, and check!
Also, for anyone who doesn't know: as of right now this series is available on YouTube for free! I definitely have no problem paying and supporting this wonderful program, but for low-income families, or anyone who (like me) likes to try before they buy, check them out over there!",1459555200,,1992,4.540389972144847
5322265,5,B009E8C05M,It's like an interactive story for you and your kids. It doesn't even feel like exercising. My 4 year old loves it! A great way to incorporate yoga without him even realizing it! Love her voice and storytelling.,1454198400,,211,4.578947368421052

5322270,4,B009E8C05M,"It's very cute but too much up and down. Would like to have it flow a little slower so my toddler can get the moves. And I can keep up with her.
Otherwise it's very enjoyable to make Yoga fun.",1447804800,,192,3.825
5322271,5,B009E8C05M,"This is the MOST ridiculous yoga I've ever seen. The animation behind Jamie is awful and the stories she tells make no sense at all. It moves quickly and it is not the relaxed yoga I associate with yoga.

Despite what I think of this DVD, my children LOVE it. Absolutely positively love it. My 3 year old goes through each 15 minute story consecutively, that's 45 min straight of yoga. Kind of unheard for my 3 year old to do anything for that long. My 6 year old enjoys it too. I am just amazed and I'm disappointed that this is the only Cosmic kids dvd available.",1445731200,5,565,4.231481481481482

Her accent (from the UK) adds to the pleasure as she tells the story of Squish the Fish or Kickapoo The Kangaroo.

After the birth of a new baby, we moved our 2.5 year old from full time daycare at a center (where she could run and play) to home all day with nanny and baby. I got this video with hopes she can disperse some of that energy indoors,  yet quietly. This video surpassed my expectations.  Our daughter asks to do yoga daily. She is easily able to follow the moves and it's captivating enough that she can complete not just one story, but at 2 of the 3. Best of all, I find that our evenings are better since she is able to stretch, move, and burn energy without running around and disturbing the baby. Highly Recommended.
