3136599,5,B0015083Q2,"A French brandish charm has been reduced to mere clothing while some goods purchased on money paid by crims defended screened during two Parisian stories of contemporary police investigations.

Not lacking of gore, shootings and killings, this work is emphasized predominantly on human affairs hardly allowing to distinct between villains and defenders, leaving a viewer shocked with a naked truth of democratic realities heralded.",1356307200,2,431,5.734375
3136600,5,B0015083Q2,"Dramatic, beautiful show, with compelling central characters. Female police inspector,  male prosecutor (= DA), ambitious and cynical judge. The acting is good, the story zips along at pace, with twists, excitement, romance, politics and corruption of various sorts. After four episodes I still don't quite know what to make of some of the characters. There's a Romanian gangster figure who seems to be all bad, various low-lifes, and a lovely set of sub-plots woven around one main story.

Don't watch this if you are shocked or offended by explicit violence and gore. The French is too fast for me (need the subtitles) but the whole thing is tremendous.",1305331200,26,655,5.055555555555555
3136601,5,B0015083Q2,"This is a superb series. But a word to the wise - the french do not have the gentle sensitivities of the USA programs in dealing with brutality - nakedness is not covered with a mystical glowing white light(NCIS like) or blurred, so be prepared for a blunt and brutal run through an excellent story, well written with excellent performances especially from the police.

3136623,5,B0015083Q2,"With the recent addition of the international MHZ Choice subscription to the Amazon Prime options (check it out), my husband and I are now watching Spiral seasons 1 - 5 for the third time. It's one of the best shows we have ever seen, hands down. The plotting is tight and the characters--and the relationships between them--are fully drawn and absolutely believable. I agree with other reviewers who have compared this series to Law and Order and The Wire, and with those who have said that after a while you don't even realize you are reading subtitles. (My husband speaks a little French, I don't--but now I want to.) Yes, you do learn a bit about the French justice system, but those details are just enmeshed with the story--they are never boring. Spiral is absolutely engrossing. Highly recommended!",1483401600,7,805,4.840579710144928

3136660,5,B0015083Q2,"Don't care for crime-of-the-week series, I prefer continuing story arcs with some sort of resolution at the end of a season.  Swedish and British productions have typically been favorites.  Initially I thought this one was one of the of-the-week varieties -- couldn't have been more wrong.  Midway through episode 2 the ""Spiral"" title made sense.

Don't make the same mistake I did and start watching this in the evening -- it's very difficult not to watch all the episodes.  Very well done :-)",1460246400,,494,4.903614457831325

3136662,3,B0015083Q2,"Intentionally too bloody and cruel, although the story is interesting",1455580800,,69,6.0
3136663,5,B0015083Q2,"Our son Jeremy clued us into this series. He said, Its like a French version of Law and Order, but very French.  (WARNING: It's in French with English subtitles.)

Spiral is the English title. The French is Engrenages, which translates as gears, but with the sense of intermeshings and complications. Each season tells one story, with various other cases woven in behind the main one for variety. Seasons 1 and 2 are eight episodes long, each roughly fifty minutes in length. (They don't carve out as many minutes from the hour for commercials in France as they do in the States.) Seasons 3 and 4 are slightly longer, 10 and 12 episodes respectively. Weve watched seasons 1 and 2 to date and are eager to tackle the third season.

The same principals appear in all four seasons: Caroline Proust plays police captain Laure Berthaud. Shes in charge of the unit investigating the crimes. Shes good at her job, feisty and dogged. She also sleeps around. So does Gregory Fitoussi, who plays assistant judge advocate Pierre Clement, but they make more of her affairs than of his. Clement is handsome, discrete, and ethical, a good collaborator with Laure. But ethical isn't always a good thing or at least not a safe career choicein the French judiciary, which is just as riddled with personal and political currents as ours, maybe even more so (more overtly so). The people above him, all the way to the ministers, value dedication to justice, just so long as it doesnt rock the boat or put their friends, relatives and business contacts at risk. One of the themes of this show is how Pierre and Laure maneuver around this part-corrupt governmental system. They have an ally in a maverick senior judge, Roban, played by Philippe Duclos, with long, thin foxlike face, piercing eyes and a shock of dazzling gray-white hair that is always flying out of control. Roban is a high stickler but one who broaches no abuse of the law. Since this is France, with a civil service judiciary and the Code Napoleon as its legal code (fewer protections for the accused, a stronger presumption of guilt once a culprit is hauled before the court, and a much heavier involvement of the judge advocates in ongoing investigations), Roban is in on the investigations from the start and ultimately sets the limits on how the police shall proceed. Then theres the fourth major player in this fascinating series. Audrey Fleurot plays Mlle. Josephine Karlsson, a hungry (no, voracious) young lawyer with no morals. Or better, she is one who finds it easy to swallow her morals in exchange for advancement (spelled money). She uses her sexuality foxy face, breasts, hips, long slim legs and flaming red hair--as a tool to advance her cause but her biggest weapons are two: intelligence and ambition. She works for the bad guys and will stop at nothing to win. But what makes her character more than a stick figure is the look on her face as step by step shes drawn into deeper and deeper waters, more and more illegal actions. The hatred between her and Laure is palpable.

Around these four, the good and bad guys gather. Good are the members of Laures police team, although one, Gilou (played by Thierry Godard), is fighting drug addiction in the first series and a crook uses that to compromise him. It all works out in the end though. Gilous basically a good guy, just rough around the edges. Bad are the crooks, but also corrupt and callow officials, influence peddlers and everyone who wants an easy ride rather than justice for the truly offended. The first season starts with the discovery of a young womans body. Her face has been obliterated someone beat her to death. By the end of the season, others are dead and a sordid story of influence peddling, corrupt business dealings, white slavery and drug peddling has unfolded.  The second season starts with the burning of a mans body in a car. It soon ascends to untouchables: Tunisian or Algerian gangsters who cant be reached because everyone is too afraid of reprisal. Laure has to insert an undercover agent into a drug deal that can go bad at any moment.

Everything about this series works: the complicated intermeshing of big case and lesser cases, superior scripts, the exceptionally fine acting, even the photography, which veers toward black and white or a colored variant of sepia but never quite gets there. The feeling is like watching an updated 50s noir movie, the colors of the film just leaking menace, enhancing the mood of moral entropy that predominates in a series like this, in which the actors don't fill cookie cutter slots here a good guy, here a badbut rather act out complicated lives where choices matter.",1453593600,4,4662,4.770755885997522

3136682,5,B0015083Q2,They don't pull any punches.  The good guys aren't always good and the bad guys have their reasons. Very well done.  Some of the early episodes are really gruesome but I think that the director figured that out and eventually made an adjustment to clean it up. Something like this could never be produced on American television because of it's blending of black and white.  The actors here are superb.  Good Show get beyond the blood and you'll be fine.,1439596800,2,453,4.625
3136683,5,B0015083Q2,Excellent series. I don't usually like to read subtitles but with this series I forget that I am reading. Different plots going on at the same time so you must pay attention. Great acting!,1439424000,,188,4.5588235294117645
3136684,4,B0015083Q2,"A love story...or at least an unrequited love story...set in a police procedural. The French cosmopolitan approach might be a little off-putting to Americans, especially those who are upset with the ""hook up generation."" But this is France and and no on thinks twice about it. Oh, and there are some crimes to solve and all that, too. It is one of those shows that I wish Amazon had a season pass for since the per show cost makes it a lower priority when searching for a good foreign show.",1438214400,,490,4.455555555555556

3136703,5,B0015083Q2,"My dad has gotten real obsessed with learning French since he retired a year ago. He's always singing these storied historical French songs, sometimes out loud and other times I can tell he's singing them in his head to practice. It's cute. He started reading a pretty boring sounding book written in French about a meadow (or something) and was taking forever to get through it when it hit me - TV is more fun and far easier to do than reading! So I did a few searches for top French shows and this one was ranked highly. Gave it to him for Christmas and he was surprised and appreciative. Well at first he didn't know it was a French tv show and just thought it was some random American crime drama he'd never heard of. When he found out what it was he was glad to get it. He and my mom wound up watching it together, even though she isn't into learning French really at all. He enjoyed hearing spoken French and they both got into the story. It brought them back together after years apart! Just kidding they were fine, but they both really enjoyed it! Glad to have other seasons to give bc I am normally a pretty mediocre gift-giver.",1432512000,6,1137,4.317757009345795
3136704,4,B0015083Q2,"Very good show, can get gory. I don't think it is worth the $2 bucks an episode, not even close. It should be streaming free or maybe a buck an episode at the most.",1428278400,,164,3.8529411764705883
3136705,3,B0015083Q2,"Not thrilled. Spiral is in French, spoken *very* quickly, with subtitles. One is dazzled by the French, the lack of Puritanism in the show. On the side of disenchantment, there is excessive gore which is not essential to the plot. This is not a show for med students. Also, under all the glitz is a fairly routine procedural. Won't be back when there are shows like ""Rectify"" which is dazzling in its literacy and acting.",1428192000,,421,4.626666666666667

3136707,5,B0015083Q2,It's one of the best dramas I've ever  seen.  The subtitles seem to mesh with the French and I don't even notice them now.  But it really is a terrific show.  Aboout the very best in any language.,1425513600,,196,4.078947368421052

3136710,5,B0015083Q2,"After starting to watch this series immersion style back to back for days on end, I found myself hating American TV. Why you may ask, because french actors appear more believable, and frankly better looking than American or British actors. Very wide range of Genre'. What some see as average acting, I see as Natural, because there is no super villain with uncanny diabolical mind here, but realistic cases, not meant to detract or embellish the careers  of the various protagonists as the American shows seem to do. Also the constant jumping between different lines of inquiry makes it fast paced and intriguing. American shows seem one dimensional and slow moving by comparison. Yes slow moving not in the sense of action per se but underlying context. Ok so I have been thoroughly sucked in and become a francophile. Who knows the french might do something tomorrow to turn me into a francophobe again.",1423612800,3,905,4.876623376623376
3136711,5,B0015083Q2,"Love this series, have 1-4 already and am watching 5 right now. Each series deals with a specific crime and that crime will be solved in that series but there is a continuing sub-story that is being played out  through the whole series. The number one thing that you will notice is the difference in the way an investigation is carried by the French police. Definitely worth watching.",1422748800,,384,4.647058823529412
3136712,5,B0015083Q2,"Fantastic show. Great casting and acting, addictive little theme song, good stories. Some really gory scenes though, just as a warning. They are not afraid to show very mutilated bodies, and it's that typical thing of course where they're pretty much all women (a habit of many crime shows).

But this is still a favorite. It's a little like a French version of Law & Order, except better. Not as formulaic, better writing and acting, not as much court time (more about behind the scenes and the Public Defenders interfacing with the police), more complex and nuanced stories - they don't assume the viewer needs everything spelled out and spoon fed. Also you will learn a little about how the French justice system operates a bit differently than the American. I'd say Spiral is more comparable to The Wire, although that show is really in a league of its own.

Many of the cases deal with current political and social issues facing France and other European countries. Judge Roban has become a highlight, especially as the series goes on (I'm into Season 4 now). If you liked any of the other hit Euro crime dramas - Wallander, Forbrydelsen, Broen - definitely check this one out!",1422316800,6,1182,4.760975609756097

3136716,5,B0015083Q2,I just finish watching it again.  The first time I saw it on tv and decided to buy all 4 seasons of the dvd.  I am glad I did because I missed some things the first time.  It is fast paced and gets your interest right away.  All the actors are great especially my favorite Philippe Duclos as Juge Roban. Will be watching Season 2 next.,1418601600,,335,4.03030303030303

However, I had no problem with the subtitles in Spiral, not only because of their clarity, but also because of the fine acting skills of the cast.

The story is complex, as are the characters--very realistic.  I saw the review of someone who compared the excellence of Spiral to that of The Wire, and I would agree.  Along with the threads of the stories themselves, there is the added fascination of learning a bit about the French justice system and different social classes.

My husband and I zipped through Season 1; we were quickly addicted.  Spiral Season 2 seems just as gripping.  Fine writing, complex characters, some introduction to French society and justice, and compelling story lines; this fine series has them all.",1418515200,6,926,4.822784810126582

The essence of soap opera is that keeps twisting and turning without getting anywhere.

It was disappointing to find that Spiral, despite recommendations and its gritty look, is just a soap opera. I couldn't watch it after a couple of episodes.

The leading characters also are quite unsympathetic. You really do not care what happens to them.

A word to soap opera lovers: this series has some extremely gruesome scenes with ultra-realistic mangled bodies. You might want to stick to Downton Abbey.",1411171200,3,546,4.967032967032967

But, unlike L&A, characters are developed fully; Quirks, follies, and cute guys an gals speaking French. What is not to love.

Now in its fourth season (streaming on Netflix or, seriously, buy 1-3), you can catch up with how the lives are going. But, frankly, if you can, start with season one to meet and know the hmms and whys of almost every player in the fourth. The hour-long stories that take a season's worth to conclude, do stand alone, but, it is much more visceral when you know who is who.

For example, Laure Berthaud (Caroline Proust) she is very into no-strings-ish relationships. Until she isnt. She is a woman after all. She runs the team we spy on, and call her boss lady if you like, just don't fence her inher panther-like pace is palatable. Meanwhile, her slithery boss is a misogynist first class.

And Pierre Clement (the swell-on-the-eyes in any language, Gregory Fitoussi) is a career oriented chap. He is as aloof as he is handsom, until he isn't - he's a guy after all. Plus, you'll recognize his beauty, but from where? Youll be IMDB-ing him so you can sleep. Here, he plays a spiraling (<- hardeeharhar) attorney and gets thrown into dark gray areas so fast its as if hes twirling around in a cotton candy machine of pure manly-man yumminous!

Then theres Josphine Karlsson (Audrey Fleurot), the defense attorney you will adore to despise. There is nothing she is not capable of  and her priorities are vein-popping-ly annoying, in a have-to-watch way. And team partner, Gilou (Thierry Godard) whose incompetence and drug-fueled stake outs will have you pausing the player until you calm down. Hes an idiot. And a scrumptious character.

Youll want to binge-watch for sure. And the subtitles are easy. You don't have to work too hard to watch the mostly-in-Paris settings. Enjoy.

3136757,5,B0015083Q2,"Just finished watching this a second time (on Netflix).  As many others have noted in this thread, there are some scenes that are not for the faint-hearted.  Maybe living so close to Bosnia and other European disasters have given the French a numbness, when it comes to extreme after-evidence of violence or very extreme acts of sexual violence or even (as some have noted here), the willingness to ingest very foul things, but, these caveats aside, the series is a good insight into ways in which the French investigatory/ legal system is different than the Anglo-American system.  You also get to see what the main social ills in Modern France comprise, including drug-dealing, human trafficking,and a sector of the population that is economically and socially estranged from mainstream France.  The actors are superb.  You will come to care very much for the female police detective and her team, and the young, idealistic Assistant Prosecutor.  You will be intrigued by the quirky instructional judge, who works hand in hand with the police team, to build a case. There is an intriguing young female attorney.  For students of French language, the dialogue is a wonderful way to build up your familiarity with the language.  I give a strong recommendation to this series.",1381104000,2,1275,5.038095238095238
3136758,3,B0015083Q2,"I would humbly offer that as a community we tend to extremes in rating, and generally to over-rating, which is not a service to folks who are deciding whether something is worth their hard-earned dollars. I have trouble fathoming allocating ""Spiral"" five stars, and although it is indeed very gruesome at times, I have almost as much trouble understanding a one star rating. ""Spiral"" is nowhere near as good as standout series such as ""The Wire"" or ""Deadwood"" or even ""Breaking Bad."" It is not that well written, not that well-plotted, or that well-acted. It is just okay. The characters grow on you a bit, but they still are a bit wooden and stereotyped. The bad guys are awfully bad but there is no hint of why that might be so. Coincidences - such as the baddest of the bad guys being at the airport in the same line with the parents of his victims - add up. And a general feeling that really you are watching some form of high-end soap opera takes hold. I had higher expectations from reading a NY Times piece about great new French television shows. I was disappointed. Not truly bored, not repulsed - but disappointed. This deserves a three or two star rating.

I don't want to see French police watching a drug mule evacuating his bowels on the floor of a police station lavatory and then wolfing down handfuls of his own excrement to deny the police the cocaine packets that were hidden in his bowels. I don't think it is necessary to show a horribly battered naked female body in such loving detail. It makes me wonder what sort of person enjoys this sort of film. The French police and their so-called ""judiciary"" are presented as a very strange lot. The so-called ""judge"" behaves more like a deranged prosecutor. The senior prosecutor (a lawyer) consorts with an old school friend who is engaged in pimping and supplying drugs to highly placed clients. This same prosecutor tells the female police inspector to check for witnesses in the neighbourhood of a crime. Why didn't she just tell him that she knows how to do her job. In the Anglo world of criminal justice and policing in big cities, no police inspector would usually investigate both serious murder cases and a ring of petty thieves as we see happen in this series. I know that some people who make these films feel that they are artists and that they have a duty to ""confront"" viewers and push the boundaries of what is acceptable to show on screen but I feel that this series is simply an exercise in very bad taste.",1357689600,18,1802,5.702602230483271

3371160,5,B0015083Q2,"Our son Jeremy clued us into this series. He said, Its like a French version of Law and Order, but very French.  (WARNING: It's in French with English subtitles.)

Spiral is the English title. The French is Engrenages, which translates as gears, but with the sense of intermeshings and complications. Each season tells one story, with various other cases woven in behind the main one for variety. Seasons 1 and 2 are eight episodes long, each roughly fifty minutes in length. (They don't carve out as many minutes from the hour for commercials in France as they do in the States.) Seasons 3 and 4 are slightly longer, 10 and 12 episodes respectively. Weve watched seasons 1 and 2 to date and are eager to tackle the third season.

The same principals appear in all four seasons: Caroline Proust plays police captain Laure Berthaud. Shes in charge of the unit investigating the crimes. Shes good at her job, feisty and dogged. She also sleeps around. So does Gregory Fitoussi, who plays assistant judge advocate Pierre Clement, but they make more of her affairs than of his. Clement is handsome, discrete, and ethical, a good collaborator with Laure. But ethical isn't always a good thing or at least not a safe career choicein the French judiciary, which is just as riddled with personal and political currents as ours, maybe even more so (more overtly so). The people above him, all the way to the ministers, value dedication to justice, just so long as it doesnt rock the boat or put their friends, relatives and business contacts at risk. One of the themes of this show is how Pierre and Laure maneuver around this part-corrupt governmental system. They have an ally in a maverick senior judge, Roban, played by Philippe Duclos, with long, thin foxlike face, piercing eyes and a shock of dazzling gray-white hair that is always flying out of control. Roban is a high stickler but one who broaches no abuse of the law. Since this is France, with a civil service judiciary and the Code Napoleon as its legal code (fewer protections for the accused, a stronger presumption of guilt once a culprit is hauled before the court, and a much heavier involvement of the judge advocates in ongoing investigations), Roban is in on the investigations from the start and ultimately sets the limits on how the police shall proceed. Then theres the fourth major player in this fascinating series. Audrey Fleurot plays Mlle. Josephine Karlsson, a hungry (no, voracious) young lawyer with no morals. Or better, she is one who finds it easy to swallow her morals in exchange for advancement (spelled money). She uses her sexuality foxy face, breasts, hips, long slim legs and flaming red hair--as a tool to advance her cause but her biggest weapons are two: intelligence and ambition. She works for the bad guys and will stop at nothing to win. But what makes her character more than a stick figure is the look on her face as step by step shes drawn into deeper and deeper waters, more and more illegal actions. The hatred between her and Laure is palpable.

Around these four, the good and bad guys gather. Good are the members of Laures police team, although one, Gilou (played by Thierry Godard), is fighting drug addiction in the first series and a crook uses that to compromise him. It all works out in the end though. Gilous basically a good guy, just rough around the edges. Bad are the crooks, but also corrupt and callow officials, influence peddlers and everyone who wants an easy ride rather than justice for the truly offended. The first season starts with the discovery of a young womans body. Her face has been obliterated someone beat her to death. By the end of the season, others are dead and a sordid story of influence peddling, corrupt business dealings, white slavery and drug peddling has unfolded.  The second season starts with the burning of a mans body in a car. It soon ascends to untouchables: Tunisian or Algerian gangsters who cant be reached because everyone is too afraid of reprisal. Laure has to insert an undercover agent into a drug deal that can go bad at any moment.

Everything about this series works: the complicated intermeshing of big case and lesser cases, superior scripts, the exceptionally fine acting, even the photography, which veers toward black and white or a colored variant of sepia but never quite gets there. The feeling is like watching an updated 50s noir movie, the colors of the film just leaking menace, enhancing the mood of moral entropy that predominates in a series like this, in which the actors don't fill cookie cutter slots here a good guy, here a badbut rather act out complicated lives where choices matter.",1453593600,4,4662,4.770755885997522

He's always singing these storied historical French songs, sometimes out loud and other times I can tell he's singing them in his head to practice. It's cute. He started reading a pretty boring sounding book written in French about a meadow (or something) and was taking forever to get through it when it hit me - TV is more fun and far easier to do than reading! So I did a few searches for top French shows and this one was ranked highly. Gave it to him for Christmas and he was surprised and appreciative. Well at first he didn't know it was a French tv show and just thought it was some random American crime drama he'd never heard of. When he found out what it was he was glad to get it. He and my mom wound up watching it together, even though she isn't into learning French really at all. He enjoyed hearing spoken French and they both got into the story. It brought them back together after years apart! Just kidding they were fine, but they both really enjoyed it!

3371207,5,B0015083Q2,"After starting to watch this series immersion style back to back for days on end, I found myself hating American TV. Why you may ask, because french actors appear more believable, and frankly better looking than American or British actors. Very wide range of Genre'. What some see as average acting, I see as Natural, because there is no super villain with uncanny diabolical mind here, but realistic cases, not meant to detract or embellish the careers  of the various protagonists as the American shows seem to do. Also the constant jumping between different lines of inquiry makes it fast paced and intriguing. American shows seem one dimensional and slow moving by comparison. Yes slow moving not in the sense of action per se but underlying context. Ok so I have been thoroughly sucked in and become a francophile. Who knows the french might do something tomorrow to turn me into a francophobe again.",1423612800,3,905,4.876623376623376
3371208,5,B0015083Q2,"Love this series, have 1-4 already and am watching 5 right now. Each series deals with a specific crime and that crime will be solved in that series but there is a continuing sub-story that is being played out  through the whole series. The number one thing that you will notice is the difference in the way an investigation is carried by the French police. Definitely worth watching.",1422748800,,384,4.647058823529412
3371209,5,B0015083Q2,"Fantastic show. Great casting and acting, addictive little theme song, good stories. Some really gory scenes though, just as a warning. They are not afraid to show very mutilated bodies, and it's that typical thing of course where they're pretty much all women (a habit of many crime shows).

But this is still a favorite. It's a little like a French version of Law & Order, except better. Not as formulaic, better writing and acting, not as much court time (more about behind the scenes and the Public Defenders interfacing with the police), more complex and nuanced stories - they don't assume the viewer needs everything spelled out and spoon fed. Also you will learn a little about how the French justice system operates a bit differently than the American. I'd say Spiral is more comparable to The Wire, although that show is really in a league of its own.

Many of the cases deal with current political and social issues facing France and other European countries. Judge Roban has become a highlight, especially as the series goes on (I'm into Season 4 now). If you liked any of the other hit Euro crime dramas - Wallander, Forbrydelsen, Broen - definitely check this one out!",1422316800,6,1182,4.760975609756097

However, I had no problem with the subtitles in Spiral, not only because of their clarity, but also because of the fine acting skills of the cast.

The story is complex, as are the characters--very realistic.  I saw the review of someone who compared the excellence of Spiral to that of The Wire, and I would agree.  Along with the threads of the stories themselves, there is the added fascination of learning a bit about the French justice system and different social classes.

My husband and I zipped through Season 1; we were quickly addicted.  Spiral Season 2 seems just as gripping.  Fine writing, complex characters, some introduction to French society and justice, and compelling story lines; this fine series has them all.",1418515200,6,926,4.822784810126582

The leading characters also are quite unsympathetic. You really do not care what happens to them.

3371235,5,B0015083Q2,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: Spiral is a cop dramabut that makes it sound clich and this wonderfully paced and cast show is far far from typical. Here, the police detective team is woven and complicated. And like its American cousin, Law & Order, the show takes you through every step of a crime. But, unlike L&A, characters are developed fully; Quirks, follies, and cute guys an gals speaking French. What is not to love.

Now in its fourth season (streaming on Netflix or, seriously, buy 1-3), you can catch up with how the lives are going. But, frankly, if you can, start with season one to meet and know the hmms and whys of almost every player in the fourth. The hour-long stories that take a season's worth to conclude, do stand alone, but, it is much more visceral when you know who is who.

For example, Laure Berthaud (Caroline Proust) she is very into no-strings-ish relationships. Until she isnt. She is a woman after all. She runs the team we spy on, and call her boss lady if you like, just don't fence her inher panther-like pace is palatable. Meanwhile, her slithery boss is a misogynist first class.

And Pierre Clement (the swell-on-the-eyes in any language, Gregory Fitoussi) is a career oriented chap. He is as aloof as he is handsom, until he isn't - he's a guy after all. Plus, you'll recognize his beauty, but from where? Youll be IMDB-ing him so you can sleep. Here, he plays a spiraling (<- hardeeharhar) attorney and gets thrown into dark gray areas so fast its as if hes twirling around in a cotton candy machine of pure manly-man yumminous!

Then theres Josphine Karlsson (Audrey Fleurot), the defense attorney you will adore to despise. There is nothing she is not capable of  and her priorities are vein-popping-ly annoying, in a have-to-watch way. And team partner, Gilou (Thierry Godard) whose incompetence and drug-fueled stake outs will have you pausing the player until you calm down. Hes an idiot. And a scrumptious character.

Youll want to binge-watch for sure. And the subtitles are easy. You don't have to work too hard to watch the mostly-in-Paris settings. Enjoy.

Maybe living so close to Bosnia and other European disasters have given the French a numbness, when it comes to extreme after-evidence of violence or very extreme acts of sexual violence or even (as some have noted here), the willingness to ingest very foul things, but, these caveats aside, the series is a good insight into ways in which the French investigatory/ legal system is different than the Anglo-American system.  You also get to see what the main social ills in Modern France comprise, including drug-dealing, human trafficking,and a sector of the population that is economically and socially estranged from mainstream France.  The actors are superb.  You will come to care very much for the female police detective and her team, and the young, idealistic Assistant Prosecutor.  You will be intrigued by the quirky instructional judge, who works hand in hand with the police team, to build a case. There is an intriguing young female attorney.

I have trouble fathoming allocating ""Spiral"" five stars, and although it is indeed very gruesome at times, I have almost as much trouble understanding a one star rating. ""Spiral"" is nowhere near as good as standout series such as ""The Wire"" or ""Deadwood"" or even ""Breaking Bad."" It is not that well written, not that well-plotted, or that well-acted. It is just okay. The characters grow on you a bit, but they still are a bit wooden and stereotyped. The bad guys are awfully bad but there is no hint of why that might be so. Coincidences - such as the baddest of the bad guys being at the airport in the same line with the parents of his victims - add up. And a general feeling that really you are watching some form of high-end soap opera takes hold. I had higher expectations from reading a NY Times piece about great new French television shows.

I don't think it is necessary to show a horribly battered naked female body in such loving detail. It makes me wonder what sort of person enjoys this sort of film. The French police and their so-called ""judiciary"" are presented as a very strange lot. The so-called ""judge"" behaves more like a deranged prosecutor. The senior prosecutor (a lawyer) consorts with an old school friend who is engaged in pimping and supplying drugs to highly placed clients. This same prosecutor tells the female police inspector to check for witnesses in the neighbourhood of a crime. Why didn't she just tell him that she knows how to do her job. In the Anglo world of criminal justice and policing in big cities, no police inspector would usually investigate both serious murder cases and a ring of petty thieves as we see happen in this series.

8256841,5,B0015083Q2,"Spiral is a French police procedural, that goes beyond the nitty gritty. Much of the series takes place outside of the offices. But when we do go in the detectives offices are bleak and dirty. Even though the series is filmed in color, it is dark so it seems to be filmed in black and white. The first episode can be the one that makes or breaks the series. In the first series we come to get to know the characters involved. The detectives all have their own stories, and it seems these people all have secrets, and learning about them all brings us closer to the group. We also meet the lawyers, the judges and the official hierarchy of these professions.

Deputy Prosecutor Pierre Clement, played by Gregory Fitoussi, is the first person we meet after we see a mutilated naked body. The head police detective Laure Berthaud played by Caroline Proust, is very professional on duty, but in her private life, quite the opposite. One issue that drove me crazy through the four series I have seen is that Laure has no sense of herself, her hair is always a mess, and she wears clothes right off the floor, and,she is looking for Love in most of the wrong places. The other two main detectives Tintin and Gilou, have such interesting lives you need to see them.

In the first series the main crime is the death of young women, their mutilated bodies found in different places. There are other crimes, and we have a glimpse into the French criminal system and the corruption inherent. How these characters react to these situations is the stuff that makes this series so worthwhile.

8256842,5,B0015083Q2,"I watching this one on Netflix. I just started season 2. I could say it is the ""French Law & Order"", as many others have pointed out. But it is really a shallow description. The show has everything that would not be acceptable by the American audience: It is politically incorrect, has loose ends, requires the viewer to draw its own conclusions, it doesn't have heroes and it is graphic, very graphic.

The police (""les flics"") are not bright, but they are not Keystone cops either. They are regular people that come to work with jeans and t-shirts and try to do their best on a job that is doomed to fail. Their boss is Captain Laure Berthaud. Caroline Proust superbly built her character throwing high doses of sensuality and determination. If you combine that with her overprotectiveness of her force, it translates into a desirable maternal figure.

It is also quite interesting from an American perspective to see how the judicial French system works, completely different from the American. The French system would never be acceptable in the US as the American system would never be accepted in French. Nations, their systems and cultures are much more different  than we tend to believe.",1500768000,,1195,4.848039215686274
8256843,5,B0015083Q2,So beyond perfect. Fast pace. Outstanding stories. Unbelievably great actors. Extremely interesting characters developing over time. I was so addicted I watched 8 to 10 hours at a one time and had to stop to go to bed. Anyone who doesn't rate this show 5 stars is crazy or has anything negative to say. If all shows were like this no one would do anything else but watch tv. Wish there were 500 more episodes. I am on season 4 and hate to get to the end of it all. There really aren't enough words to describe how perfect it is in all aspects. And I have watched enough out there to be an expert. If Oscars were there for tv this would win them all in every category.  Thank you to all involved.,1500422400,2,695,4.186567164179104
