8506910,4,B00004CM2Z,"A great movie that turns into a real horror movie because it happenned and still goes on, covered up by a parent, like in the movie.  This movie is probably more relevant today than when it was released because of so many single parent families in todays society.  I caught this movie on cable TV and recently transfered it to DVD.  I wish it was available on video with out all the comercials which really kills the tension between the two brothers. Atleast I was able to delete the comercials, but a good quality DVD is due this great movie.",1150675200,6,543,4.41
