5881039,5,B00E00GBYA,"It's One Piece, who can say it is anything but spectacular. I do have to say that I can't recall how many are on this disk, but there are quite a few fillers that may drive you a bit nuts. Personally I skipped them since they had nothing to do with the main storyline. But at least they weren't as bad as some other Anime's (such as the 6 seasons worth of fillers in Naruto! UGH!)...

Either way I am positive you will love this.",1389225600,,429,4.047058823529412

5881064,5,B00E00GBYA,"If your a fan of One Piece, this box set is for you! This set holds four collections into one, while saving some money in the process. I received this as a gift, and as a long-time OP fan, I loved it!

The episodes included are amazing. It picks up at episode 206 and continues the adventure at the G5 naval Camp. Shortly after, the series explodes with an amazing new story arc that re-defined how insanely good this anime truly is.

The Box Set itself is awesome! I have been waiting years for good quality sets that I could purchase. Thankfully, Amazon has finally supplied us with this Set. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.",1433116800,2,634,4.410256410256411

I really hope they come out with box set 4 soon because I will snatch it up quick! If you love One Piece get your hands on these sets. If you don't have much money then save up and buy em. Pretty worth it. I can watch One Piece now without having to stream it plus you get the DVDs in a cool collectible box that comes with exclusive stickers, a poster, etc.",1430784000,,523,3.943396226415094

5881072,5,B00E00GBYA,"Great collection once again! I felt the animation was stepped up quite a bit from past episodes but that's how it is with anime, they get better and better with time. I love how it's a different theme with the box sets, 1st was Luffy, 2nd was Zoro and now this one is Nami. Any fan of One Piece should pick this up! Can't wait for the next box set!",1428364800,,348,3.9857142857142858
5881073,4,B00E00GBYA,"Have the previous 2 sets, this is very similar to those. This set does include volume 12 which doesn't release individually on Amazon until April 21, so if you don't have 9,10,11 already and want 12 now, for some reason, this set will get it to you.",1427760000,,249,4.319148936170213
5881074,5,B00E00GBYA,"I got to say that I love this.  I love the episodes that this collection treasure chest set covers, and the best part is that I was able to get collection 12 early because of this.  The bonus items that come with it are pretty nice as well, and I think the actually box that holds the collection sets looks great on this set.  instead of small little symbols, it uses a really big symbol of a compass.  It really does look great.  this was definitely worth the purchase.  If you are a fan of the series then I cannot recommend this anymore then I already have.",1427760000,,560,4.186915887850467
5881075,5,B00E00GBYA,"Awesome box. it arrived damaged...well. Maybe not for others, but for me as avid anime collector. The cases was cracked and inside of those cases...some are loose disc which caused scratches on it.  I had it replaced...:-( But itself box are awesome. the bonus items are focus on Nami like first set which that focus on Luffy. Awesome box. However it must be in excellent shape to add up onto the anime cabinet in my room.

Update: The replacement just arrived yesterday, I checked every cranny and nook of this product. Its all perfect shape. :-D",1427760000,5,547,4.6875

5881077,5,B00E00GBYA,great show,1425168000,,10,4.5
5881078,4,B00E00GBYA,"This review is more about the product then the content, as I assume if you are getting box three you already like one piece, and have the other two boxes.

This box starts with collection 9 which starts at episode 209 and ends with the 12th collection. That collection is to be released in April 2015 and ends at episode 299 which is in the middle of Season 5. I doubt we will be seeing another box set for a bit, as funimation would need to release 4 more collections, 13-16.

These boxes they are nice to have. These black boxes keep these individual collections protected but they aren't made to the highest of quality. The seams on the first black box have torn, already.

When you receive this packaging make sure all of the cases are not broken when you get them. These seem to be packaged in a bit of a rush, some of my cases were in shrink wrap some were not. I have received two broken cases as well, or cases with the disk being loose. Luckily for me the disks were not scratched.",1424563200,21,990,4.25531914893617

5881083,5,B00E00GBYA,"I bought this for my son who is a big fan of this series.  He was very pleased.
I have watched it with him and like the rest of the series it is entertaining, and the
animation is some of the best out there.  While this is definitely not a cartoon for
younger viewers, it is a fun and enjoyable animation for teens and adults without being
over the top.",1409270400,,353,4.0285714285714285

8599643,5,B00E00GBYA,"This box saves a great deal on worrying where my other discs are since they are all in the same box.  And as a bonus if I have trouble with any of the cases inside or the discs are scratched I don't have to waste money on a new exclusive set, but instead buy a new copy of the case.

8599648,5,B00E00GBYA,"This product arrived in excellent condition. I had read some reviews mentioning that these boxes had some issues with wear or damage, however this seems to have been fixed by Amazon. This box did not have any noticeable wear and the individual DVD cases on the inside were not damaged in any way. This box set is far cheaper than purchasing the collections individually. I believe that I paid about $67 for this collection. The average price for an individual collection is about $20 and this box set contains four of them. If you love One Piece then you should love this set.",1474243200,,576,4.601941747572815
