5901482,1,B00EC6VT8U,Really bad. Not a good movie. Don't buy this or rent this movie it's not worth it. I thought it was the one in theater's and it's not! Do not recommend this movie at all!,1387065600,,170,3.8857142857142857
5901483,1,B00EC6VT8U,Not very well made and a dark film over all. Wasn't something I wanted my two year old daughter to see. Ended up turning it off half way through.,1386979200,,145,4.0344827586206895
5901484,3,B00EC6VT8U,As a story - it was nice.  Turned into this movie - it lost something.  I'm not sure any but the younger girls will like this and it may not hold their attention through the movie.,1386633600,,180,3.9722222222222223
5901485,5,B00EC6VT8U,"Just in time for the holidays, The Snow Queen is a perfect movie to set the tone and the mood. As soon as my daughter saw the cover she asked me to put it on.

It kind of reminds me of a cross between Rapunzel and Madagascar as far as the characters and animation go. Since those are two of Paiges favorites, Im sure that has something to do with her loving this movie! Little ones might be a little scared in the beginning but my kids werent.

The evil snow Queen trys to dominate everyone by using her power to freeze the world. Gerda is just a baby when it happens and her parents are frozen and shes separated from her brother. She goes to live in an orphanage with a mean master but her true heritage always lies beneath the surface.

When this movie started, theres immediate action and even I was drawn into it and while I started out as multi tasking, quickly sat down next to my daughter to watch it with her. I loved the animation and the colors. I could almost feel the chill!

Most importantly, I loved the message and the classic good versus evil battle. There will always be those that try to let evil dominate but good will always persevere.

The Snow Queen is the new most requested movie in my house and will be a beloved family tradition for years to go. I love adding to our library of holiday movies to get us in the spirit!",1385424000,11,1344,4.214007782101167
5901486,4,B00EC6VT8U,"i haven't read the original in a while, but this was just as rich to watch as i remember it was to read. the animation was some of the most expressive i've seen, though there are some hard cuts here and there that kinda chop the action up. but then, it really is all about the story.",1382572800,4,283,3.982456140350877
5901487,4,B00EC6VT8U,"The animation kept on pace with the story very well, but the English soundtrack looked like that it was improvised.",1381968000,,115,4.8
5901488,4,B00EC6VT8U,"I've watched the English version of Wizart's ""The Snow Queen"" on video-on-demand, and there's one thing I like and one thing I dislike.

For the thing I dislike is the English dialogue.  It almost reached to its expectations, but it doesn't look like that it was keeping up with the animation or the story.  It looked like that it improvised than putting up a good effort.  I wonder what the English subtitles would say while watching the Russian version.  If it's exactly like the English version or if it is not any good, I'll just create my own English subtitles to make it worth telling than improvising.

For the thing I like is the animation keeping pace with the story.  The director of this feature has promised that it is in modern perspective, and that it has shown high expectations.  Even though a few scenes may be a bit confusing at first, but let's just say that it referenced our everyday life experience.

Wizart Animation has shown great qualities in the animation business.  Even though it kind of looked like a parody of Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks, Blue Sky, Illumination, and so forth; but it did put up a good effort in producing their animated feature.  If give their movie a ""B+.""  However, I'll give them an ""A"" if they do a better job with the English soundtrack.",1381622400,,1288,4.6255506607929515
5901489,5,B00EC6VT8U,Super cool movie. Why it is not promoted anywhere?!,1444348800,,51,4.777777777777778
5901490,3,B00EC6VT8U,"It's very easy to compare this film to mega-hit ""Frozen,"" but there's a lot more reasons why you shouldn't. The presence of a Snow Queen as a central character and a girl off on a journey to rescue someone she loves is about where the similarities stop between the two films.

First, let's start with the good. It's a fun adventure. And the adventure is what the original story of the Snow Queen is all about anyway. The story gets the basics right. There is a protagonist and antagonist. The antagonist does something bad, so you know you don't like her and you're cheering for the protagonist to stop her. You care about the protagonist enough that when she faces adversity you actually hope she wins. (This might seem like the real basic, high school stuff that's not even worth mentioning, but a lot of films have forgotten this.) The story is kept basic enough that it doesn't venture into the ridiculous.

What about the bad? The animation is low budget and it shows. I'm not really crapping on it, because despite the low budget, the film doesn't necessarily feel cheap. You can see they put a lot of work into it, and there is a sense of pride with it. This is also a film made in Russia for Russians. As a result, it utilizes a lot of satire, and not everyone really appreciates satire, especially if it's not from your own country. The movie also suffers from pacing problems, but let's be fair. I have yet to see an adaptation of the ""Snow Queen"" that doesn't have an issue with pacing, including Frozen! The lore and Gerda's world is interesting, but the issue they don't go far enough with developing their ideas. I almost feel as though the story rushed itself where it shouldn't have rushed. An extra half hour would have made all the difference in the world for this film.

The ugly of the film is actually more our fault. The ugly is in the English dubbing. I was fortunate enough to watch it in Russian with English subtitles and am very disappointed the English DVD release doesn't offer that option.

Overall, you get what you get with it. Don't expect a Russian version of Frozen. Instead, take it on its own merits. Enjoy it for what it is, not for what it isn't.",1438819200,,2185,4.482412060301508

5901493,3,B00EC6VT8U,"This was an OK movie. Entertaining for my 3yr olds. Nothing spectacular.

But I just couldn't get over a couple things:
The amount of cleavage showing and the size of them. They even jiggled with movement.
Then there was the initial love interest between two characters who turns out are siblings.",1426723200,,297,4.823529411764706
5901494,1,B00EC6VT8U,Good story but ruined by the English dubbing. This really needs to have the option for Russian language without the Dubbing. I'll turn on subtitles if I wanna know whats being said. It completely ruins it.,1410307200,3,205,4.722222222222222
5901495,2,B00EC6VT8U,"The movie has great graphics, though that is about all that is good. The plot is broken with scenes that make no sense and leap about chaotically with no direction. Gave it away.",1407024000,,178,4.424242424242424

5901500,5,B00EC6VT8U,The snow queen and frozen are very good have almost the same point to get accross. I love both of them. Thank you,1396396800,3,113,3.9565217391304346
5901501,4,B00EC6VT8U,"Admittedly this was not the best movie I've seen. It did seem a little unclear and rushed but, considering it's full background one can't be too critical. This movie was originaly produced and released in 2012 in Russia and then elsewhere in Europe. Watching this US release it is obvious it has been dubbed.
Having seen the original in Russian this English version did a poor job with much of the meaning lost in translation. Hence the confusing dialogue and jokes that fall flat. Of course what other countries and cultures find funny will not always make sense to us Americans. The original also has a better soundtrack with completely different artists and songs. There are better English subtitle versions on youtube.
Regardless of language I felt the animation was superb! Especially the final scenes. And as others have noted it is very family friendly for all ages.
Naturally this movie will forever be compared to Disney's Frozen. But, this version does try to stay closer to the true Hans Christian Andersen tale, A plus for pureists, but taking away in entertainment value (Have you ever compared Disney's animated Alice in Wonderland to the true story?)
I do not believe this movie was ever made with the intention of a US release, but because of the success of Disney's Frozen this hurried conversion was done, and who could blame them for trying to capitalize on it. However considering Frozen was still under development while this was in theaters who's ripping off who when you can find identical marketing posters and screenshots of the two movies?",1393027200,3,1565,4.909433962264151
5901502,5,B00EC6VT8U,I loved the characters in all the action shots!  I was in suspense most of the time because the action was fast and exciting!,1391644800,,125,4.208333333333333
5901503,2,B00EC6VT8U,"Very low budget movie, and then after I rented it on Amazon for $4 I seen that I could have saved my money and watched it on Netflix for free. . .",1390780800,,146,3.59375
5901504,5,B00EC6VT8U,"Surprisingly good!! Good animation, good plot, not too soppy... I enjoyed it I would recommend it to children of all ages who like to believe in good triumphing over evil.",1390176000,,171,4.733333333333333
5901505,4,B00EC6VT8U,"The movie was a bit boring at the beginning, but it got way better. It teaches you a lesson not to be hatred. The talking in the animation was a little off because the movie was translated to English. This movie is made in Europe. I do not know what all the bad reviews are about. It is AMAZING. Definitely buy.",1389916800,,311,4.114754098360656
5901506,4,B00EC6VT8U,"It's nothing new when a major studio puts out a major theater film, tons of smaller companies try to make use of the hype through creations of similar works.  In this case, the obvious premier of Disney's ""Frozen"" has inspired many other films with a similar theme...this film being one of them.  Ironically, though it certainly does not come close to the ""Disney magic"", it still manages to leave it's own mark and stand on it's own.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Really, there's not much to worry about for Parents and Guardians.  This is a kid's film and stay pretty clean.  However, two female minor characters do wear victorian style clothing with the characteristic lower neckline...so for some parents that may be an issue.  Also, one character either said, ""Darnit"" or ""D***"".  I couldn't really tell the difference because of the way he said it.  But beyond that, no language issues.

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
Disney's Frozen is a more liberal take on Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale ""The Snow Queen"".  This DVD movie is a closer adaptation to the original tale...but it still takes quite a bit of poetic license.  This has nothing to do with one being better than the other, just thought it should be noted.  But as to the actual plot, it's not bad.  It did feel rushed at times..especially in meeting with the king. And some of the dialogue was kind of cheesy.  Still, it had a believable flow. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.  Still, it did succeed in areas and did have some powerful and hair-rasing portions...especially the last portions.

CHARACTERS:
The characters were generally shallow.  They weren't bad characters, but there was no major development (probably due to the more rushed nature of it).  The voice actors also did a good job, but not a great one...and the main protagonist, Gerda, had some moments where the actress's potential really shined and areas that were...not so much.  Still, they worked for the film and were still entertaining and I was not annoyed with any of them.

VISUALS:
Too often, in smaller ""copy"" productions, I've run into bad animation and effects.  However, this was a pleasant surprise.  The animators really put a lot of care into the work and details.  The movement was very smooth and believable.  Gravity affected the movements naturally.  The backdrops and settings carried natural tones...nothing overly eccentric.  The details on the characters' were very nice...and the overall designs were charming.  Even natural effects like snow fall, lake reflections, etc. were wonderfully constructed.  This showed that this company did take their work seriously...and perhaps even enjoyed it to some degree.

MUSIC:
The music was surprisingly powerful and really helped this film overcome it's shortcomings.  This is a rarity amongst many smaller productions...but I'm glad they were able to pull it off.  It did add to the narrative.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
None...it's just the movie.

ALL IN ALL:
No regrets in having this film, and I will keep it.  Though it certainly suffers from some weaknesses, it has a generally heartwarming story and manages to achieve memorable high points.  Even more important, it maintains a believable character of it's own.  It does not feel like it's trying to copy something else.  All in all, this will be a hit or miss for some people...but as for me, I really do appreciate the work put into it and am glad to have one more decent adaptation of Han's Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"" available.",1387929600,9,3494,4.982698961937716
5901507,1,B00EC6VT8U,"This movie was badly done, badly animated and had a trite, idiotic plot.  My kids, pre-teen girls (presumably the ideal target audience) absolutely hated it and asked me to write a review.

It's the same sort of odd, texture-mapped, motion capture crappy looking animation that they used on the polar express, except those soulless ugly huge eyes on everyone.  The snow itself looks OK, but the characters looked just plain awful.

And I did mention that there's nothing but the most simplistic sketch of a plot, right?

Don't rent this.",1387756800,,537,4.9222222222222225
5901508,5,B00EC6VT8U,"First off I will say I as surprised with the animation of this movie.  Sometimes when DVDs are made from a company outside of the top animators (Disney, Pixar...) the animation can be sketchy, but this DVD is decent.  The movie is about an evil Snow Queen who uses her power to freeze the world.  It is a great story line about the battle between good and evil, showing kids that being bad never wins at the end.  There was constant action, memorable characters, a story line adults and kids can appreciate and animation you can appreciate.  My kids and I have watched this DVD a few times already and I am sure we will watch this many more times!

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1387411200,7,721,4.383458646616542

8603687,1,B00EC6VT8U,"Do not buy this version. One of the main actors in it, Ivan Okhlobystin, said he wanted to ""burn homosexuals alive."" The man is a major bigot and products using his talents don't belong in your house with your children. I highly recommend the 1957 Soviet version of the Snow Queen using beautiful hand drawn animation (equal with Disney's best), gorgeous music and there is a version which was dubbed in English. It's a classic... this is trash.",1473206400,,445,4.717948717948718
8603688,4,B00EC6VT8U,"This is not frozen and frozen is not it. The only thing these two have in common is the story it's based on and this is more faithful.
Each charcter is charming and each have a backstory. Also this cover is crap because the one in Russia is better. This is not a frozen knockoff.
This movie is an underrated B movie, in fact I liked this better than frozen, but like I said before they are not related except by the story it's based off.
The animation is pretty okay, the voice acting is great but the lip sync is off at times.
I loved the characters and I loved how you think the main male lead is going to be one charcter when in fact it's somebody else. Also a girl in a dominating role?  And she's a kid? Their no love intrest either? That's a break through. She does get help but these characters are so interesting, and so are the side characters.

Also this movie came out before frozen, so people who claim this is a knockoff are just ignorant. That's like saying frozen is a knockoff of this.",1465862400,,1001,4.181347150259067

8603692,4,B00EC6VT8U,It was closer to the story I remember. Frozen is cool too but my boy loved this one too. Loved the work they put into it.
