8539987,5,B009D4GTLS,"Whoopi Goldberg was the perfect choice to narrate this tale. Young Koi seeks adventure with just Kola nuts. Each animal he meets needs a few nuts for various reasons. He is rewarded for his kindness by each of the creature. Yes, once again my grandchildren and I enjoy another adventure . . . one not familiar to them. The artistic drawings and music accompany the narration to give us another fun video. Just for fun? Add this to a collection that encompasses many different cultures . . . Enjoy!",1376352000,,497,4.595505617977528
