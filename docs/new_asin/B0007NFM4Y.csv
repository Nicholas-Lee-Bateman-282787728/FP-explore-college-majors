8049233,5,B0007NFM4Y,"""Of those who have met Osama bin Laden, few have dared to talk about him --until now. This documentary uses first-person accounts to trace the influential events in bin Laden's life, from his childhood in Saudi Arabia to his battles with the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, culminating in the events leading up to Sept. 11, 2001. It provides insight into the man who may have masterminded the most deadly act of terrorism in the United States.""",1215475200,,441,4.815789473684211

No doubt, some Native Americans and some Muslims have done hideous things; but the target of their terrorism, the ""civilized"" people of the West, have a hard time looking at the violence their society inflicts on other people in the world.  While even security analysts can point out the dynamic of ""blowback""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blowback-The-Costs-and-Consequences-of-American-Empire/dp/B000H2NAW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire</a>&nbsp;there is a tendency of US citizens to prefer narratives that portray our society as superior and doing good things in the world.  This DVD lends itself to that convenient self-perception.  While it provides very valuable information on bin Laden, it doesn't spend much time on the suffering and bloodshed created by state terror.  It was the US that created the ""Afghan trap"" that tore that nation to shreds and created the Mujahadeen that eventually turned on Dr. Frankenstein.  We tend to forget that the Mujahadeen were once celebrated by the West and invited to the White House - see the cover photo of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terrorism-Theirs-and-Ours/dp/1583224904/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terrorism: Theirs and Ours</a>.

Hopefully this DVD will encourage people to investigate further the West's violence that is the creator of Arab violence.

8049235,5,B0007NFM4Y,"PBS's ""Meeting Osama Bin Laden"" is a well-made documentary, giving insight into the life of one of the most sought-after terrorists of our time.  Well researched and including interviews with people who have met or spent time with bin Laden, the film portrays bin Laden as a normal, peaceful man, who grew up as a withdrawn, quiet and shy child.  What made bin Laden who he is today?  This documentary attempted to aswer it.

Many books were written about Hitler, Himmler and other evil mongers in our history, but none of them managed to point at one event, or even a series of events that could be identified as the turning point for these people, a turning point leading them into committing despicable crimes.  Same goes for bin Laden.  Raised in a rich family, receiving good schooling, I couldn't see any triggers that would have moved Osama to become so filled with hate that he issued a religious proclamation authorizing the killing of all Americans, including women and children.

Granted, there are several situations in which one could see that Osama was shunned by even his own state and his own family, which in turn could make him bitter, but no event so big that would justify such pathological hatred.  Like Hitler, after this documentary, I see bin Laden as a sociopath and a megalomaniac with incredible charisma, who was in the right place at he right time.  Naturally, further research is needed, but this documentary is great for initial studies into the life and mind of the world's worst terrorist.",1177891200,2,1522,4.800766283524904
