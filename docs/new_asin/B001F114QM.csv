If your into history this is a must see movie. There is one more thing this is the first movie that follow by 3 or 4 other movie of the same name. I learn alot about history by watching the movie.",1372636800,,418,3.929411764705882
3559357,1,B001F114QM,"This is the most ridiculous so called documentary on Genocide. And unfortunately it does not surprise me at all. As I figured it would be another documentary set up to look like America barely had there hands in the dark shadows and blood lust for genocide.

The documentary talks about the Germans and the Jewish holocaust in length and it goes into the Armenian and the Bosnian even the middle eastern all in depth and at great length.

But when it comes to talking about The American slave trade which was only covered for roughly 2 minutes they suddenly change their tune about genocide and begin to say that slavery is not a real form of genocide and begin to make excuses about how America genocided African American families for more than 400 years responsible for over 250 million deaths over that period.

What they refuse and are ashamed to talk about is as we we're shoved into those giant ships over those decades tied one on top of the other forced to defecate on ourselves for months on in; with close to no food or water. Forced to watch our sisters raped by the millions; No blankets freezing cold! Most of us did not make it across the sea.

Only a small number of us survived to America.

The demonic voyage of American Genocide slavery was just to harsh for most of our families to make it! Millions we're thrown over board countless and faceless.

Not to mention before we even boarded the ship we we're held for weeks on in beaten raped and thinned out so that's before we even got on the ship and before being held in the slave house which you can visit or google to this very day! if you'd like! We also had to walk hundreds of miles to those horror houses.

Then we make it to America only to be written on the constitution as live stock and then 3.5th of human beings.

and that's when it even sunk to a deeper level of genocide! They begun cultural genocide and educational genocide because for most of the time in slavery we were not allowed to speak our own languages or speak the English language! We were forced to only be allowed to grunt and moan like monkeys and animals and we we're not allowed to read or write English or our mother tongues for hundreds of years.

No other genocide has ever come close to this and it all happened on American Soil and was okay-ed and practiced by white Americans and British and Dutch and French alike. All the presidents okay-ed African American Genocide for all or most of their terms! George Washington had slaves and raped and beat them Abraham Lincoln had slaves probably did the same Thomas Jefferson was another rapist and murderer of slaves and they don't even get brought up because America does not care about African People and would rather avoid talking about it all together!

Then they devised Jim Crow Laws to extend slavery and further genocide us Africans living in America. And right now they allow Police to murder and profile us and our families. Jordan Davis and Kimani Gray we're just killed only because they we're black. Africans our the longest race to be Genocide in this ravenous manner and people continue to lie about our plight! Racism and Hate against Africans is Everywhere and propagated by American European lies and Media! And Africans suffer from hundreds of years of Stockholm Syndrome and Body Dysmorphic Disorder. It's and American nightmare! And the USA needs to apologize and clean up their hateful mess of genocide.",1372464000,,3426,4.5924713584288055
3559358,3,B001F114QM,"It is an ok documentary. A little too much emphasis on crime against Afro Americans,really history of Civil rights and Jim Crow. More emphasis on Native Americans.
Good archival visuals.",1368921600,2,186,5.233333333333333
8300340,5,B001F114QM,"This should be required viewing by everyone - from students, teachers, parents all the way through our various levels of government - to include the international community. This is part one out of four films regarding GENOCIDE. Our most horrible violent part of human history was the 20th Century. Two world wars, internal conflicts and the UNNECESSARY KILLING or EXTERMINATION of human beings for reasons that don't make sense. This includes the US and their extermination of our native American Indians. One atrocity leads to another atrocity and we all suffer.

Whether it be in the name of liberty, justice, freedom, religious or whatever - in the end its senseless. The photography is very graphic - but REAL, NOT A STAGESHOW ORMOVIE DEAL. BUt it has to be this way to truly understand the horrors and pain and anguish people inflict upon each other. I have served in the US Army at all levels and been in many different areas and operation for over 30 years. I know and understand what is presented here and I am appalled by mans transgressions upon fellow man.  BUtthis helps make the genocide issue very clean and it must stop and it starts with people like you and I. We will feel sad, angry and so one. You and I cant fix the past. But what we donow wioll help prevent future genocides - no mater who you are or where you live. A VERY VALUABLE HISTORY LESSON WE ALL NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT RECOGNIZE AND TRY TO PREVENT AND ERADICATE.THIS PROBLEM. WE ARE OUR OWN WORSE ENEMIES. Please look at the presentation with open eyes, mind and heart. This is as close as you will come to visually seeing genocide for what it really is.",1520899200,,1635,4.57679180887372
8300341,5,B001F114QM,Terrifying in bringing the knowledge of atrocities that many of us never knew had occured or hadn't understoood the importance of their happening.

8300346,5,B001F114QM,"This documentary, for me, has confirmed what I've affirmed since my youth - that man has an insatiable thirst for violence that I must (underscored) find a way to quell. The amazing irony in 'The Genocide Factor' is that the Turkish culture continues, even today, to suppress what the remainder of the world already knows - what a complete wonder...",1430352000,,349,4.833333333333333
8300347,5,B001F114QM,"Good documentary. This is the first in the series of 4 films. Disturbing images (compiled to have an impact on audience) compared to other genocide documentaries but coverage of various genocides is well done. In this film it is clear that genocide is not a recent invention and that identifying groups as different and undesirable, and then moving on to eliminate them, has happened again and again. There is an array of scholars who speak about genocides and the factors that may contribute to the rise of genocide in a particular population. Some mass killings included as genocides may spark conversation and discussion since they don't usually get the label of genocide (e.g. witch hunt killings), but this is one aspect of the video that I appreciate. The next video covers the first half of the 20th century.",1409270400,,815,4.913043478260869
8300348,3,B001F114QM,"It is hard to ascertain whether this film is the first in the series or what? In trying to search for an answer as to why humans are capable of the depravity encompassed by genocide this film adds fodder but does not approach an answer - other than the ""genocide factor"" in humans. Too disjointed.",1396656000,,297,4.418181818181818
8300349,4,B001F114QM,"This presentation of genocide is well narrated and informative. The evidence presented is simplified and reasonably accurate. Original footage is well organized with validated documentation. How to classify genocide as opposed to mass killings or political/military actions is addressed. This series is intended to be educational, not sensational. There needs to be a way for individuals and the international community to recognize the symptoms before the killing become so ruthless that it cannot be contained. It has been said that 'absolute power corrupts absolutely' and these incidents, by what ever name, are an example of power. Political power that intends to defeat all opposition by whatever means possible. Easy enough to blame a given people and create an environment that encourages violence. When ideas are passed on through generations it isn't difficult to create that spark that becomes an all consuming conflagration. Individuals see each other in a way that says, 'kill or be killed.'  The intent of the definition of genocide by the UN has been almost forgotten. There is no system of diagnosis or  enforcement in place. If that power isn't condemned then the history of genocide will continue to be repeated. Indonesia, several countries in Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East continue without any resolution.
Would you choose to be a bystander?

Education offers an answer but can this lesson be learned? There is no absolute answer. This series is definitely recommended!
