7810943,5,6301313941,I remember watching this movie in preparation for my little brother. I have such fond memories of it. I wish I still had it just to watch one more time. This movie made me excited for my new baby sibling. I would buy this for my future children!!,1306886400,,246,4.145833333333333
7810944,2,6301313941,This movie was not worth the money I paid. My son loves movies and I thought that this would help with a new sister. He only watched it once and it did not help him.,1251590400,,165,3.742857142857143
7810945,5,6301313941,"We used this wonderful video to prepare our first child for the arrival of his baby brother.  Note - his reaction to ""Wouldn't it be nice to have a baby brother"" was throwing himself screaming and crying onto the couch and yelling, ""NOOOOOOOOO!!!!""  It was a great way to discuss what it would be like, making it much more concrete for him.",976233600,5,340,4.467741935483871
