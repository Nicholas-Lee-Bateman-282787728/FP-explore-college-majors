7204560,3,B00XZF385Q,"I thought this movie was hilarious with predictable scenes but I wasn't completely hating it. I waited until I only had to rent it for 99 cents. I had read some of the reviews and didn't want to pay more than a buck for the movie. It did drag and it was boring at times but I figured that there had to be a twist and I just needed to wait it out...Overall, it was a bit of junk food for the evening.",1448496000,2,399,3.819277108433735
7204561,1,B00XZF385Q,Worst movie we have seen in a really long time. So glad it was a free rental from Redbox because even a dollar would have been to much to pay for it. So dumb!,1444608000,,158,3.676470588235294

7204564,3,B00XZF385Q,"The film opens with a family in an auto accident. Wes Bentley is injured, in bed and doesn't have a memory. His wife Kate Bosworth cares for him as a monotone sociopath. The movie is a mystery as to what happened and where is the daughter? (Olivia Rose Keegan)  It was like watching ""Miss Meadows"" meets ""Misery"" as you anticipate the Hitchcock style twist. Meanwhile there is a detective (Shashawnee Hall) handling the case who seems to get most of his information from newspaper clippings.

Guide: F-bomb. Implied sex. No nudity. Not for everyone.",1441411200,4,549,4.829787234042553
7204565,3,B00XZF385Q,"This is a good story line but the movie is way to slow, it takes forever to get to any of the good parts. Even though there's actually a lot of action, it seems more like a really boring drama. This movie is like a knock off of Steven Kings ""Misery"" but it can't hold a match to that.",1440979200,,284,3.830508474576271
7204566,1,B00XZF385Q,"Ambitious? Sure. Evocative? Not in this universe.

Don't misunderstand me. The film looks good. Theatrical shots abound. We even have the ambiguous notion of time (assuming that was on purpose--the cop's PC and the Prilosec on the drugstore wall say so). Problem?

As a viewer, I couldn't possibly have cared any less about the fate of our 'hero' let alone the secret of the twist. I saw it coming in the first five minutes, but even if you don't, it will likely still leave you rolling your eyes. Yes, Kate's creepy detached trivia, delivered with stone cold psychopathy intrigued me. But not everything that is a good idea is transformed into its spectacular potential. I mean, communism looks great on paper, but ...

Bottom line: I want my time back. You can keep the money, but for heaven's sake, I'm mortal.",1440028800,14,813,4.75177304964539
7204567,2,B00XZF385Q,"Extremely soft lighting, monotone performances all around, unremarkable story that we've seen before and, ultimately, it's not a good film.  I hope Polish got paid well so he can make good films like I know he can.  It's a shame since seeing his name attached I was excited to see this.",1439510400,4,286,4.588235294117647
8717181,5,B00XZF385Q,A hidden gem. Modern Hitchcock with lots of twists.,1505692800,,51,4.777777777777778
8717182,5,B00XZF385Q,"Five stars for this movie? Absolutely!

I wasn't expecting much when I sat down to watch Amnesiac but as the movie progressed, I began to see the quality the filmmaker was aiming for. The story isn't hard to understand or even important really, it's the way the director took this simple story and photographed it to make it interesting....beautiful really. Using light, shadows and angles to make an excellent film out of an ordinary plot took some doing and high marks are deserving here. The cast is excellent each player doing their best to add to the mood created by the cinematography. Even the sound design is topnotch as well.

I originally watched this on DVD but after seeing it, I knew that I must upgrade to blu-ray when I purchased it. Yes, I know most may only see this as a throwaway movie but I love this little movie for all the reasons I described and I'm happy to add this to my collection.",1501372800,3,909,4.503030303030303

8717185,3,B00XZF385Q,Dumb movie and it makes no sense whatsoever. I love Kate Bosworth though...so there you go.,1462233600,,91,4.75
8717186,5,B00XZF385Q,A good twisted film. I was shocked by the ending I was definately not expecting that turnout. That woman was crazy as sticks. Would definitely watch again.,1460332800,,155,4.777777777777778

8717190,4,B00XZF385Q,I did like this movie. I did not relate this to Misery as other reviews indicated. Big difference is the man was actualy the husband very hot. It was suspenful and good enough for me to keep me interested until the very end. I felt sorry for the HOT husband. Simplistic point of view is all happened because the poor guy had not enough money to afford the crazy wife fertility treatments?. LOL.,1448755200,,394,4.410958904109589
