8232270,2,B000YDT4BE,This USO Christmas Show with Bob Hope I wasn't impressed with. It was in black and white and I didn't find it funny like other shows of Bob Hope I had seen of him and other stars entertaining the troops in Vietnam which were very funny. Maybe some people would enjoy it but I am not one of them.  The picture quality was not all I would have expected for this DVD.,1432944000,,364,4.055555555555555

8232273,1,B000YDT4BE,"This is a 1-hour show produced by the big three television networks for the USO to be shown to the armed forces IN B&W.

There IS a better copy of this under the name of ""The Lost Broadcast, the Celebrity Salute""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Broadcast-The-Celebrity-Salute/dp/B005BSP38A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Broadcast: The Celebrity Salute</a>&nbsp;with crisp clear audio & sharp picture.
However, that version is missing the Eisenhower introduction, but the quality is quite good.",1352592000,4,545,6.898550724637682
8232274,3,B000YDT4BE,"This DVD edition of a USO Christmas show for the armed forces is, unfortunately, somewhat disappointing. The others are right--this is not in color as it indicates on the cover art; you're going to get this in black and white instead. To make matters worse, the black and white footage is abridged and the quality of the print is average at best. The video starts with then-President Eisenhower speaking a few words and then we get footage of some of the stars introducing themselves--what a shame we don't get the entire video as it was released to the troops! This would have been quite a collector's treat especially if it were in color without editing out any single part of it!

On the other hand, what we do get is very good. Near the beginning there's a stand-up act by Milton Berle that remains very funny to this day; I loved it! He was really quite the comedian! We also get a good performance by Myoshi Umeki, who flawlessly sings ""It Might As Well Be Spring."" She's wonderful and very underrated these days. There's a brief clip of Van Cliburn during his ticker-tape parade in New York City after he won a trophy for being such a superlative pianist in the former Soviet Union--how I wish we saw just a little bit more of that event; we only get three or four seconds and again the quality of the video is not that great. However, we do get a very real treat when Van Cliburn does play the grand piano--in grand style at that! I met him once after seeing him in concert and he's a nice guy, too.

Danny Thomas' Italian skit is embarrassingly dated; I could skip that one without being too upset about it. However, there are other fine skits and clips: Ray Bolger's skit is great; Bing Crosby sings one of his signature songs, ""White Christmas;"" Martha Raye sings ""Takin' A Chance On Love;"" Jack Benny, George Burns and Jimmy Stewart perform wonderfully together and Danny Kaye joins Louis Armstrong for a splendid scat on ""When The Saints Go Marchin' In."" And, of course, there's more as noted by a very thorough reviewer on this webpage.

I give this a three star rating. Again, the footage that we do get is wonderful but the picture quality clearly shows it needs restoration; and the cover art incorrectly leads people to believe that they're getting this video in color, not black and white. Nevertheless, I do suggest this DVD for people who enjoy footage of USO shows for the troops; and fans of the performers in this video may want this for their collections despite its drawbacks.",1265673600,7,2502,4.567928730512249
8232275,4,B000YDT4BE,"Audio on EASTWEST's dub of USO CHRISTMAS SHOW is muffled, lacks high end and has persistent tape hiss. Video is a bit fuzzy, but acceptable. Only one dance number was abridged. Deleted performers: Sid Caesar, Red Buttons, Shirley MacLaine, Rhonda Fleming, Jane Russell, Jimmy Durante, Leo Durocher, Jo Stafford.

This two-hour variety show has been edited here to just under 90 minutes. 750 film copies were distributed worldwide by the USO to American service personnel. It was never actually broadcast. Despite transfer limitations this one is worth watching, especially for fans of the many talents on display here.

8232277,1,B000YDT4BE,"This item is noted as ""COLOR"".  This is very misleading.  I just purchased my copy and it is 100% black and white.  The only color in this DVD is the cover.  I was also hoping to see footage of the USO troops, but this is a studio production.  There was no footage of troops except 1 shot lasting about 2 seconds.  The sound is very muffled, hard to hear and understand.  I do not recomment this DVD to anyone!",1196899200,13,410,4.113924050632911
