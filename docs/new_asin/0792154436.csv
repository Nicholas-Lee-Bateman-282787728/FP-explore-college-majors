The way Mark-Paul Gosselar and Tom Everett Scott  interacted was hilarious and the way the story was layed out was just  great. If it weren't for that Cliff guy, who got annoying at times, the  rating would have been higher though.

179907,3,0792154436,"At a point in my high school life not too long ago, I decided to basically watch every high school/college movie I had not yet seen in hopes to find a few I could enjoy to go alongside classics like ANIMAL HOUSE and the closest we have come recently to that film, AMERICAN PIE, ROAD TRIP, and OLD SCHOOL (though none can compare, obviously). Anyway, DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS was an intriguing film, as when I watched it I laughed out loud a few times, chuckled and smiled a lot, and then returned it to its Blockbuster rental home. Soon after, the more I thought about it, the more I was surprised I really enjoyed it. It became a movie I didn't want to spend the money on to buy, but I wanted it as a gift. Finally this Christmas I got it, and upon watching it again, still enjoy it. Yes, it is often (okay, constantly) stupid humor, but the concept is so funny that you would REALLY have to try to mess this up to make it not work. The film also creates 2 likable characters, something teen movies have a hard time doing a lot of times.
 Anyway, the story concerns Josh (Tom Everett Scott), a 'got all As in high school' kind of guy with a 6-year med school plan at the prestigious Daleman university. Then he meets his new roommate Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, of SAVED BY THE BELL fame and with black hair, most likely to mock his blond hair from the show), a slacker stoner who is there merely because his dad owns one of the top toilet cleaning companies. Cooper and Josh strike up a friendship, however, as Cooper makes Josh meet a girl and ultimately fall behind on his studies. From there the main story starts: Josh and Cooper both fail their midterms, and Josh discovers that he needs all B+ or higher grades to keep his scholarship, while Cooper's father threatens to quit paying for his schooling and make him scrub toilets if he doesn't clean himself up. Therefore, Josh would need a series of A+++ grades, and Cooper would have to (gulp) STUDY. They find another solution, however: if your roommate kills himself, you get straight A's. Josh and Cooper don't want one another dead, and their hot-tempered Catholic school result of a roommate (a pre-FREAKS & GEEKS Jason Segel, who hooks up with Linda Cardellini, but I digress) has been staying elsewhere, so the two decide to find the most suicidal guy on campus and drive him to take his life. I guess this is where a lot of critics roll their eyes. ""These two nice guys would never try to convince someone to commit suicide,"" they say, puffing on their snooty pipes. Well, if you're desperate to get your life back on track, I've seen dramas where people do crazier things. And besides, they were suicidal BEFORE, so Josh and Cooper are just helping him along.
 Whatever. You already know how this ends up, as this is a comedy (one way or another, Cooper will become a better person, Josh will learn to lighten up and have fun sometimes, and only a few bodies will hit the floor). It's hard to give this movie a good review because the material could have been used in a much more clever, mature way (i.e. make the film smart and witty, not dumb, why-am-I-laughing at this), but that's why comedy is such a wide-open spectrum. I can enjoy dumb and smart comedy equally, and it certainly takes smart guys to make funny dumb comedy (Mike White was a co-writer of this film after all).",1199404800,2,3343,4.451876019575857

179911,3,0792154436,"""Dead Man On Campus"" is a film about two guys who enroll at Daleman College, and become roommates. Josh enrolls via a scholarship, and is studying to become a doctor, and Cooper, well, he's just there to avoid having to clean toilets for a living at his father's business, and of course, to goof off and party. Josh eventually decides to party with Cooper, and as a result, starts to fail every class he's in. He winds up failing his mid-terms, and he finds out that he needs to maintain a B+ average if he wants to keep his scholarship.

One night, while the boys are at a local bar, they find out that if your roomate commits suicide, you get straight As for your grief, so they decide to move a suicidal roommate into their dorm!

In my opinion, the best roommate they find is a no holds barred psychotic named Cliff O'Malley (played by the underrated Lochlyn Munro). Cliff is my favorite character in this film! He's so wacky, and he completely lacks sanity or a conscience! Most of his dialogue and facial expressions in this film is priceless! I'd list a few quotes, but I'm sure Amazon will bleep 'em out!

As for their other roomates:

Buckley: He's a computer nerd who's paranoid, suicidal, and thinks Bill Gates is after his brain!

Matt Noonan: He's the ""depressed"" goth rock star who acts happy and likes to sing show tunes when no one's around!

In the end: This is one of the most underrated teen stoner flicks ever! For off the wall teen comedies, this is as good as it gets, right up there with ""Wayne's World"" and ""A Night At The Roxbury"". This movie originally bombed at the box office when released in August of 1998, and seems to be forgotten nowadays, but trust me, it's funny, and the character Cliff totally makes it worth the admission! It's bound to become a cult classic sooner or later.

3 1/2 stars out of 5.

As for the DVD: It contains a non-anamorphic 1.85:1 widescreen transfer, as well as English Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 soundtracks, as well as a French Dolby Surround 2.0 soundtrack. The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer for the film.",1155513600,,2095,4.509234828496043

179914,5,0792154436,"I can't even begin to express how much I love Dead Man on Campus. Ok, well maybe I can. This movie is hilarious and it's nice to see the actor who portrayed Zack on Saved by the Bell (I forget his name, forgive me) doing something that doesn't suck. The introductory credits are even a lot of fun in this, but that's not why I love this movie. I love it for it's pure simplicity, for all the scheming to pass their classes...it takes me back to my college days, which weren't all that long ago. Plot synopsis has been fairly well covered, so I'm not going to rehash it, but this movie gets great when our 2 main characters discover a loophole that would allow them to get all A's, but someone needs to kill themselves. I just love how they stalk other students they believe to be at risk for suicide and all their roommates and potential roommates who could possibly live up to (or die up to in this case) their expectations. It's dark, twisted and hilarious. If you enjoy college movies, you'll love this offbeat one. It's one of my absolute favorites in my collection. And if you liked Dead Man on Campus, chances are you'll also enjoy The Perfect Score which has a similar feel but with high school kids trying to pass the SAT. Good stuff! Don't miss it!",1138838400,4,1257,4.353191489361702
179915,5,0792154436,"Everyone I talked to when this movie came out said the same thing, ""The guy from Saved by the Bell? It must suck."" Having never watched SbtB, I still don't know which actor they're talking about. Maybe that helps.

I laughed a lot during this movie, which is your typical college sex and drug comedy, with a lot of dirnking. It is juvenile, puerile, adolescent, and a total guilty pleasure.

Get this DVD for when you're ill or at home bored. It's guaranteed to put a smile on your face.",1130803200,,487,4.4
179916,5,0792154436,"It seems that ""Dead Man on Campus"" has always been one of those ""so-so"" movies to a lot of people. If you've seen it you're either like ""man that's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen"", or you say ""man that's one of the worst movies I've ever seen."" There appears to be no middle ground with the movie. I don't really understand why though. The movie to me has always been a comedic gem in my collection, and one that I dust off from time to time, and take a trip back into the laughs the movie can offer. ""Dead Man On Campus"" has an interesting plot, which I'm sure most of you are familiar with, and it's mainly because of its topic, which deals with suicide, that I think the movie has remained relatively cult like, and never received the attention it deserved. However if you're looking for a good laugh, and something with an entertaining, interesting plot, this is one you should most definitely check out.

""Dead Man On Campus"" follows Josh (Tom Everett Scott), a bright young college freshmen ready to start his first semester at Daleman College. In the beginning Josh is all about studying and keeping up his good grades (I mean he has to maintain a B+ average to keep his scholarship!), and doesn't really take much to the social life surrounding him. Well at least at first.... Cooper (Mark Paul Gosselaar), Josh's lively roomate, quickly shows him the finer points of being in college; partying and girls. Josh quickly falls behind in his school work, and after failing all of his midterms, realizes there is now way for him to pass and keep his scholarship. Cooper's father is also threatening to take him out of college, If Cooper doesn't pass every single one of his classes. So both have pretty much given up hope, until being turned on to a loophole in the school's charter, which awards any student straight A's, whose roommate commits suicide. So Josh and Cooper must find the best candidate for the job. The jokes and laughs in the movie are hilarious. I personally find Kyle to be one of the funniest characters in the movie, with his memorable lines about jacking it to the freshmen facebook and his polite ""don't **** with my stuff"". Cliff is also a widly entertaining personality, with his constant humping of things and outlandish behavior. Tom Everett Scott and Mark Paul Gosselaar really work well together and give good performances, as well as the rest of the cast (including Allison Hannigan, and a bunch of smaller actors). There's plenty the movie has to offer, if just given a good viewing.

This has been labeled as a ""black comedy"" (like I said mainly because of it's topic of trying to get a roommate to commit suicide), but that shouldn't scare anyone away. It's right up there with all the great comedies of the late 90's like Half Baked and American Pie (although nothing like either), although it's always remained relatively small. That gives it a little more sentimental value, but I'm not quite sure why this movie is so underappreciated. If you like a good laugh, some dirty jokes, and non-stop entertainment, then ""Dead Man On Campus"" is perfect for you. Despite it's less than stellar reviews, it still remains one of my favorite movies, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedic offering. ""Ok now kick me in the junk!""",1128297600,,3290,4.6415094339622645
179917,4,0792154436,"It actually is a smartly written biting satire on American college life.  Good ol' Zack from TVs ""Saved By the Bell"" is going to fail all his classes unless his roomate commits suicide.  Sounds silly, but the college has a rule about such things.  One problem.  Where to find such a roomate who wants to kill himself?  Lots of sophomoric laughs (ala ""American Pie"") and a great deal of dark comedy twist around each other in this college tale.  Think of it as ""Saved By the Bell:  The College Years"" if it were written by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and was on Fox.  Great comedy that should not be missed.",1103328000,,605,4.387387387387387

Au contraire!  This has to be the best movie MTV films ever put out.  While the idea is somewhat funny in itself (passing college by inding a suicidal roommate, guaranteeing yourself A's from the trauma regardless of your failing grades), it's the characters that make this movie. Cliff, the drooling party-animal frat boy who is so high he sets a chick's hair on fire trying to lite a pipe... Buckley, the egocentric computer geek who believes Bill Gates wants him for his brain and will sacrifice himself to prevent an apocolypse... and let's not forget Matt, the depressive, maniacal British musician.  Even the locals at the bar are great.  ""Some people eat bugs... ewwwww!""

179928,5,0792154436,"Yup. This is pretty cool. Amazing, actually, though you've preferably got to have an offbeat sense of humour to fully appreciate this. The first half hour seems okay, pretty avergae, but once they get right into the story, you'll find yourself laughing like every minute. It's absolutely hysterical, and I promise you, you won't ever regret buying this because it's one of these movies you can watch continuously.",1014422400,,413,5.088235294117647
179929,5,0792154436,"I don't remember when I first heard about this movie, but I remembered it sounded funny and telling myself to see it one day. Well, come Yom Kippur, I ventured over to the video store to find me some movies to see, and hello! I saw this, and, debating awhile, decided to check it out. Remember when I said I thought it would be funny? Strike that. This movie is super funny! And it does it without too many low-brow jokes that, even though I love, you can see in any teen movie these days. Even when the movie does stoop low, it somehow does it with class.  The actors are great, and pull off the strange charictors perfectly: Matt, the ""deppressed"" musician, Buckley, who thinks Bill Gates is after his brians, Cliff who's a bit crazy, and the main caraictors Cooper and Josh, who everyone suspects are gay. I noticed some people below didn't like this movie. But hey, some people can't tell good movies when they see them.",1001548800,7,924,4.435294117647059
179930,3,0792154436,"On my list of movies that took me by surprise, this ranks pretty high. It wasn't what I expected at all.
The previews for the movie focused pretty heavily on the ""party animal"" character, as if he was one of the main characters. That's why the previews looked as though the movie would be god-awful. The movie is actually a lot different, though.
The first thirty minutes are basically a moral story about what can happen when a college student forgets his responsibilities and stops studying. That's when the suicide plot line appears, which you've probably read in other reviews.
For the next half hour, our heroes try to perfect their plan while avoiding detection. It isn't until the 60 minute mark that they meet the ""party animal"" guy - and he disappears pretty quickly. The other victims of their plot are actually funnier characters (particularly the ""Bill Gates"" guy).
I'd recommend this movie as a rental, because some of the stuff later in the movie is rather funny. Unfortunately, the first 30 minutes or so are extremely dull, and there's a sizeable dose of lame gay jokes scattered throughout.",995932800,4,1107,4.831578947368421
179931,5,0792154436,"This movie is pretty funny throughout the entire video, but about 45 minutes-1 hour into it, Cliff O'Malley comes in.  This guy is crazy.  He makes the movie for me.  Also, there is a guy in the movie who is a poser.  He is funny as well.  He pretends be a gothic guy who is in a band, but, whenever he is also, he sings showtunes, and thinks about his idol, MTV commentator Kurt Loder.  If you have never seen this, at least go out and rent it, but I recommend buying it, so that you can watch it whenever you want.",982627200,,516,4.009803921568627
179932,4,0792154436,"The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was cool but wasn't really in the mood to appreciate it much.  Knowing this, I rented it with my girlfriend who is absolutely hilarious to hang out with.  Usually I'm not a big mindless comedy sort of person, but as the two leads zig zagged across the moonlight field, black coats flailing behind them, I found myself positively in tears.  Its a great movie when you need a laugh, and is sure to pick you up from any mood.  ""I garantee it!""",976665600,2,486,4.25
179933,5,0792154436,"Dead Man on Campus is honestly one of the best movies i have ever seen! The characters are all hilarious espcially Cliff, Zeke, and Cooper. It's a definatly movie of a teenage movie, because of the plot, but some adults might enjoy it. The movie keeps you laughing all the way through, with one hilarious joke after another.",973382400,,324,4.603448275862069
179934,4,0792154436,"I was expecting this movie to be pretty stupid, but I was quite surprised. This story actually made me laugh out loud in places, and I had a constant smile on my face.
Two  students are in a predicament. They face expulsion from college unless they can take advantage of a loophole that will grant them perfect grades: the traumatic death of a roommate.
So the two students come up with a plan. They go through a list of possible candidates (the most unstable students on campus), ask them to move in, and then attempt to drive them into committing suicide. Things don't go as smoothly as they expect.
You will probably recognise the two main characters from other ""wacky"" comedies from the past. To me, ""Dead Man on Campus"" is like a combination of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Weekend At Bernie's"". The two students, caught in a dilemma of their own making, attempt to use the easy way out: (someone elses) suicide.
Although the premise is bizaare and macabre, I found ""Dead Man On Campus"" one of the least offensive of the ""college comedies"".",971568000,11,1048,4.634408602150538

He is in the story for about 15  minutes but I rolled the whole time I saw him. I even find my self doing  quotes from the movie about Cliff.  And I even remember to stop, drop, and  roll, not screaming like some chick.  See the movie and you'll know what I  am talking about.",967680000,,392,3.923076923076923
179938,4,0792154436,"Again, one of these movies which would reach a wider category of people if it wasn't that extreme.  Gosselaar just played very great, he was too  extreme.  Cliff O'Maley (character) was a lot too extreme. I scratched  half-a-star for that.
The other half-star : I believe Linda Cardellini  was great, but she could have been there like, a minute or two more.

179939,5,0792154436,"I caught ""Dead Man on Campus"" one night on The Movie Channel, I didn't think it was gonna be that good, but damn I was in for a surprise.  This movie is hilarious. Two college students,Cooper and Josh, are on a  mission to find ""Mr. Z"". ""Mr. Z"" is the most homicidal,  suicidal and genocidal guy on campus. You see, if your roomate kills  himself you automatically get a 4.0 GPA. First, they get a guy named Cliff  O'Malley,then mayhem and laughter insues, to provide some of the funniest  parts in the movie. Cliff doesn't work out so next they get Buckley.  Buckley is, well....a little paranoid. See, Buckley has a conspiracy theroy  that Bill Gates is after his brain. This character is also hilarious, but  he doesn't work out either. Finally they go for Matt, a punk rocker (his  band:""Kiss My Ass"")who is always depressed. Well, enough  said...all in all this movie is hilarious and I'm really glad I saw it. I  highly, highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. Below I see 3 or 4  negative reviews....I don't know how anyone could hate this movie at all.  It must have been a ""bad day"" or ""that time of the  month"" I guess. GO SEE THIS MOVIE !~",966211200,9,1154,4.454545454545454

The plot was different- if your roommate commits suicide, you get straight A's- the  problem was the bad acting and the bringing out of old, lame college jokes  (crazy frat boys, ... smoking, drinking and chasing women).

179942,5,0792154436,"I saw this movie for the first time in August, 1998 right before my freshman year of college.  It was a hilarious movie with great performances by Mark Paul Gosselar (Zack from Saved By The Bell! - hahahahaha) and Tom  Everett Scott.  Cliff was too much and Alyson Hannigan was really funny as  Lucy (""These are my homegirls.. isn't that what they say where you're  from?""- haha).  Its an excellent and fun interpretation of college  life and definitely a must see!",954892800,2,465,4.666666666666667
179943,4,0792154436,"First of all...I really liked this movie. I am sure some of you are saying...""what you got to be kidding"", well, no I am not. This story is based upon an age old falsehood that states ""if your college  roommate kills them self in college, the surviving roommate gets a  4.0"". Here you have Gosselaar (the old ZAK on `Saved by the Bell')  partying like crazy in college and living with Scott, who is easily  distracted by Gosselaar. Well the distractions take their toll and both  Gosselaar and Scott are headed for collegiate non-return status, when they  hear the 4.0 story. Now if you have been on a college campus as long as I  have, you will come across a great deal of students who claim this is true  and that it has happened to a friend of theirs at some college...well, you  are mistaken..it never happened and never will. But that doesn't mean you  can't make a movie out of it. If you like offensive jokes, off-the-wall  humor and can handle laughing out loud (in public) at scenes that you  should not be....then this movie is for you. Bottom line...if your roommate  is depressed, then go ahead and take them to see this film, they will laugh  so hard that they will forgot their worries (at least for a few moments.)",950400000,9,1229,4.4774774774774775
