But evil is at hand and Goku and his friends meet Tien Chautzu and there master. Tien is probably going to put up a very intense fight against Goku but that little kid will probably find some way around this weird new foe. Now that the tournament has been decided who will take the title. Will it be Jakie Chun once again or will it be Goku or maybe Krillin. Or possibly Tien!
