7967595,5,B00006FD8Y,"My husband and I have been Red Green Fans for years.  We love his quirky sense of humor, and the funny but gentle way in which he pokes fun at men, and at all mankind. I ordered three of these DVD's, one for ourselves, one was a gift for a friend , and a third to have ready to give as a gift.
I would highly recommend this DVD, and any of the other Red Green DVD's that are available. It makes a great way to spend a a half hour, or a whole evening of laughter.  I always love his pithy comments.
  Remember the oath of Possom Lodge ""When all else fails, Play Dead!""",1348012800,,567,3.9043478260869566
7967596,5,B00006FD8Y,"All of Red Green's comedies are great!

They're cult classics and worth watching over and over.

I've suggested to Mr. Smith that they should just put out a ""Season One"" disc and keep on going, like so many other TV programs have done of late.  Hopefully they'll ""get it"" sometime in the near future.",1115510400,,300,4.518518518518518
