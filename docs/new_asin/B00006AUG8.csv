.
REPUBLIC Pictures programmer RED RIVER VALLEY (aka ""Man of the Frontier"") originally ran a full hour. Presented here is the edited 54 minute version. (A 2004 restoration clocks in at 59.) Filmed on location in Yuma, AZ., Gene Autry's vocal on the traditional cowboy ballad title song includes lyrics modified by Nick Manoloff. Besides incidental music, this western songfest has one original Autry tune, a pair by Smiley Burnette and one written by both men.

The river construction project at the center of this story seems right out of the TVA or the New Deal's WPA.

SYNOPSIS--
Valley banker Hartley Moore (LaRue) sabotages efforts of local citizens to construct a Red River irrigation system. When five men overseeing the dam's construction are murdered, Gene accepts a job as ""ditch rider,"" an armed and mounted patrol officer. Steve Conway (Howard), an employee of project overseer George Baxter (Fiint), becomes jealous when Baxter's daughter Mary (Grant) shows a romantic interest in Gene. He throws in with Moore and hires Bull (Chesebro) plus several cohorts to dynamite the dam and kill Gene and sidekick 'Frog' (Burnette).

Amidst all this trouble, Gene and friends are able to perform a few numbers. It's a typical Autry western, with a usual less-than-steller supporting cast and formulaic plot that holds together primarily because of the efforts of our singing hero. Recommended for fans of 'B' unit westerns and '30s cowboy music.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.

Often, these transfers are of a quality similar to multi-film budget brands. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine yet still watchable (unless there's an inordinate number of repaired breaks). Extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies can provide a valuable outlet for antique movies unavailable anywhere else.
