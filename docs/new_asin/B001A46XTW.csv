8275952,4,B001A46XTW,I lost the second disc out of the original pair.  This purchase was an exact replacement.  I have watched this series a couple times with friends (who also play table top RPG's with me) and we enjoyed it a lot.  It is based in a fantasy world similar to the world of Dungeons and Dragons.  Good old fashioned Anime for people who enjoy the genre.,1377475200,,346,4.276923076923077
