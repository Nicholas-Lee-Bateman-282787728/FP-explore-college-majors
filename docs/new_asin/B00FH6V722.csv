5992656,5,B00FH6V722,This film is educational for those who never realized the cruelties and slavery involved. It pulls on your heart to see the intelligence and complex social order of the elephant.,1390867200,9,178,4.966666666666667
5992657,5,B00FH6V722,I just watched this on HBO and it is very well done!! A must see for everyone! When I was a kid we went to the zoo every year- I never realized the abuse these amazing animals had to go through! Great documentary!!,1388620800,10,214,4.0
5992658,5,B00FH6V722,Sad- I cried at times.,1485129600,,22,3.6
5992659,5,B00FH6V722,I adore elephants and while much of this I already am aware of I appreciated the care that went into to sharing the stories of the performer elephants. Bonus  - I learned that the one zoo I do actually patronize in oakland has paved the way for new systems of caring for Elephants in captivity. Double Bonus - learned that there is a sanctuary for elephants in my NorCal! :D,1485043200,,374,4.3428571428571425

5992661,5,B00FH6V722,"This reinforces my feeling that we should not keep animals in cages.  It amazing what people will do to make a dollar with animals.  I believe everyone should watch this show.  And I plan to post this on Facebook and instagram suggesting my friends watch this, and hopefully it will get shared.  People need to start making a stand against animal cruelty.",1484179200,,355,4.67741935483871
5992662,5,B00FH6V722,"I was angered by what I witnessed in this documentary!!  I was angered against the people who exploited and horribly abused these innocent animals....and also against those who turned their back on what was going on and nothing was done to stop it.  It should have never started....wild animals should be left in the wild and were it not for greedy, money loving people, I think they would be.  It's painful to watch....but I hope that everyone watches it so they too can see what goes on behind the scenes in order to get these poor elephants and other wild animals too, to perform.  It's despicable!!!",1483747200,,603,4.660377358490566

It's appalling what these magnificent animals are forced to do in the name of ""entertainment.""  Please watch and spread the word until there are no more elephants in any circus.  They have as much right to a free life in their natural habitat as any of us do.",1480896000,,344,4.60655737704918
5992665,5,B00FH6V722,"This is a must see documentary that brings to light the abuse suffered by these magnificent, intelligent animals for ""entertainment"". I wish this could be shown in every elementary school in this country. If children, who are naturally compassionate, are made aware of the abuse & neglect suffered by not only elephants, but all animals that are ""property"" of circuses & zoos, there will be change. Please speak up if you agree -we must be their voices.",1473292800,,453,4.896103896103896

5992669,5,B00FH6V722,"This film brings us the terrible, PAINFUL truth about how greedy men will do ANYTHING to line their pockets. The mistreatment of wild animals in the circus is SHAMEFUL. The animals are tortured so they will perform. Elephants and the Big Cats are never treated with the respect they deserve. Instead they are treated with abuse. I picket every circus that advertises  ""ELEPHANTS!"" or showcase that their
  ""LIONS & TIGERS Perform!!""  Disgusting...as bad, or WORSE than the  awful fact of human trafficking.",1470355200,2,506,5.121951219512195

5992671,5,B00FH6V722,Very moving and informing.  It is sad that the Chinese have such a high demand for ivory.  I will never go to another circus with animal acts.  Glad to see that the movement is going forward.,1466380800,,191,4.25
5992672,5,B00FH6V722,Lily Tomlin is a great narrator.  I learned a lot about elephants I didn't know and some things I wish I didn't know.  A lot of cruelty out there.,1465862400,,146,4.0
5992673,5,B00FH6V722,"Beautiful and moving. Not terribly long so not a whole lot of detailed information about the problems/solutions, but a nice summary of what is going on. I watched it with my 13 and 15 year old daughters so they could be informed. Undoubtedly they would have grown bored with something longer and more scientific, so this was a good length and simplicity to just understand generally the issue with keeping elephants in captivity.",1465171200,,429,4.890410958904109
5992674,5,B00FH6V722,"A heartbreaking documentary. I watched water for elephants a few years ago and had no idea this went on. Animals are the headliners for circuses. If people knew what they really went thru, they wouldn't be so quick to buy a ticket.",1464220800,,231,4.523809523809524
5992675,3,B00FH6V722,An interesting look at the life of elephants. You will see how elephants are trained. This film should probably not be seen by children as there are several scenes showing the cruelty that these animals go through.,1463875200,,214,4.8108108108108105
5992676,3,B00FH6V722,I think the information presented was good but I had an issue with the buffering.  Lost the flow of the movie.,1463443200,,110,4.238095238095238

5992679,5,B00FH6V722,"So glad that circuses are moving away from using elephants. Cirque du Soleil has proved that circuses can be successful even without the beautiful, majestic elephants.",1462406400,,167,5.461538461538462
5992680,5,B00FH6V722,"Such a moving and insightful film! It completely educated me on circuses, which stayed with me long after saw the film. I don't even like animals (I know!) but this film seriously moved me so much that I wanted to immediately take action in stopping the cruelty of elephants. It is just that good.",1461715200,,297,4.518518518518518

5992682,5,B00FH6V722,"Excellent depiction of how we, as humans, have broken and abused one of the most sentient beings on Earth.  We need more documentaries like this.  I believe we have become so accustomed to using animals for our own purposes, whether it be for food, clothing, work, or entertainment, that we have lost sight of why animals really exist.  They are all individuals with families and social circles and life purposes of their own and it is perhaps time that we begin treating them as such.",1460073600,,485,4.682352941176471

5992684,5,B00FH6V722,"This documentary encourages us to think about why we are on this planet. Do we share it with other animals, plants and beings, or is our purpose to dominate - at any cost and without compassion for our planet and who or what else lives here? It appears that in the case of elephants we have not respected their presence with judicious care. This documentary made me angry and sad.",1459123200,,380,4.442857142857143

5992688,5,B00FH6V722,please stop mistreating elephants!,1456617600,,34,7.75
5992689,1,B00FH6V722,The story is very one sided. That's why I call it a story and not a documentary.  It is very much like Blackfish in that regard. It is basically a story to promote the animal rights agenda and has little to do with actual animal welfare.  Would have liked to see the other side of this view. Maybe heard from the circus' and from other zoos then the Oakland zoo. Also the majority of this footage is from over 20 years ago.  I would prefer more footage from the 2000s on that way it gives a more clear view of what their life is like in present day and how training techniques have changed over the years.,1456617600,,605,4.153846153846154

5992695,5,B00FH6V722,"If you have any kind of compassion for wild animals, any concern with how they are treated by humans and for humans, this is a must see.
Animals are beautiful, compassionate, intelligent beings: the fact that they don't have a body that allows them to build things does not make them less worthy, less aware, or less God's creation than humans. I was appalled to see how they are treated, particularly in Circuses to force them to do idiot tricks for human entertainment and the lining of someone's pocketbook. More than an apology is needed.",1453593600,,542,4.71578947368421
5992696,5,B00FH6V722,Well done.,1453507200,,10,4.5

5992698,5,B00FH6V722,"After seeing the HBO documentary narrated by lili Tomlinson I will never again watch an elephant perform. The cruelty these smart animals endure can bring you to tears. Babies stolen from their mothers, families torn apart. Did you know elephants grieve deeply?",1449014400,,261,5.238095238095238
5992699,5,B00FH6V722,"This movie is amazing. It is one of my favorite movies. This really taught me a lot. I have always wanted to go to a circus and see an elephant do tricks. A friend of mine had told me that she had gone to a circus and saw an elephant do a handstand. Then, I wanted to go to a circus and see an elephant even more. Ever since then, I had kept on wishing that I could go a circus, until I saw this great documentary. Now I don't even think about going to a circus. If you watch this documentary, you won't know that it's wrong to go to a circus but still really want to go, instead you will know that it is wrong to go to a circus and NOT want to go. This movie is defiantly worth watching.",1448582400,,688,3.8181818181818183
5992700,5,B00FH6V722,Wonderful documentary. Really highlighted some good points. I'll never look at another circus the same again and will not purchase Ivory. Love those elephants. A must see.,1447891200,,171,5.37037037037037
5992701,5,B00FH6V722,True stories such as this one help promote awareness of the horrible poaching and abuse of these magnificent animals.  My family is going to watch this again.  I highly recommend it for all ages.,1447632000,,195,4.705882352941177
5992702,5,B00FH6V722,"Amazing and heartrending.  If you were moved by ""Blackfish"", you will be absolutely convicted by this film.  These wonderful, bright, social creatures simply must not be cruelly contained for human entertainment.  End.  It.  Now.",1447372800,,229,5.617647058823529
5992703,4,B00FH6V722,It was too sad and too eye opening.  I will no longer give donations to 'human' causes only to animal rights and rescue organizations,1447372800,,133,4.541666666666667

5992708,4,B00FH6V722,A real eye opener.  I always knew man was a cruel animal but to see these majestic animals treated so inhumanly was beyond cruel.  I don't think I'll ever go to another circus or anywhere that exploits wild animals for the sake of a few dollars.,1446681600,,245,4.304347826086956
5992709,5,B00FH6V722,"A nice short documentary about elephants.  It definitely creates sympathy for elephants and brings out the human side of the story.  This movie touches on the suffering of elephants and demonstrates their high intelligence through emotions.  Elephants have rituals and the elder females are the matriarchs of the clan who leads them.  They perform to avoid pain that humans force on them, and they get angry because they are inhumanely treated and will kill for freedom.  Elephants are emotional creatures who want to be with their family and live life freely like the rest of us.  We must apologize for what we have done to them in circuses and zoos.",1446681600,2,651,4.872727272727273

5992862,5,B00FH6V722,"I've always known that circuses and zoos weren't the place for wild animals, and I've always had a feeling that the acts that these beautiful creatures were forced to perform to entertain crowds were NOT something they did in nature, (a claim made by their trainers). But I've never actually seen footage of the abuse that was inflicted upon these amazing creatures. What a sickening eye-opener! I spend the majority of this film drowning in tears! It absolutely broke my heart!

During this film, they talk about an incident that had happened at the Knoxville Zoo (in Tennessee). I actually remember this happening, because we had moved close enough to Knoxville to get the news first hand. Plus, I VISITED the zoo and witnessed the Knoxville elephants, myself. (I've only been there once. That was more than enough times for me! There weren't enough redeeming qualities to bring me back.) It was easy to recognise just how unhappy the elephants were because of the constant side-to-side head swinging motion. They were forced to live in an environment that didn't even CLOSELY resemble anything that would be considered natural. Plus, the area they lived in was way too small, which is one of the reasons for their rocking motion: elephants love to ROAM! And because they barely had room to walk, they adopted that swinging motion in order to keep their bodies moving. They were so skinny, so sad, and so MISERABLE!!

But anyway, from what I've read of that poor young lady who was killed--she LOVED the elephants, and she really tried to brighten their unhappy days! But unfortunately, those sad creatures were beyond repair. PLUS!! The Knoxville Zoo was ill-equipped to handle these poor, neglected, and DAMAGED elephants! The zoo should've NEVER allowed that young lady to be anywhere near that elephant. How sad for her AND her family.

And the ELEPHANT!

People and elephants were never meant to be together like. (Or ANY wild animals, for that matter.)  But unfortunately, due to the arrogant nature of man, they believe that they are above the laws of nature.

I'm hoping that, by watching this documentary, people will think twice before paying to watch these abused animals perform, and therefore supporting their continued abuse. I realize that this is a pipe dream, but if enough people boycott these venues, maybe this barbaric practice will stop.

One can only hope!!",1435017600,8,2382,4.954887218045113

Being friends who loved to get into trouble, when hung around after the show and made our way down to the tunnels and exhibition halls of the Coliseum being nosey.  It was the first time I saw the animals up close...the reality was startling.  The big cats were being sedated in their small cages and we made our way out to the elephant tents.  Watching the handlers mistreat these wonderful creatures while shackling them was more than I could handle and the memory has stayed with me forever.  We crashed the evening performance, but I don't remember anything except what I saw below the Coliseum.

Years later as a parent, I asked my sons if they wanted to go to the circus.  We had free tickets.  I never shared with them my last outing at the circus almost 20 years prior.  They enjoyed the people, but not the animals.  They were sad for them.  They never wanted to go to animal performance circus again.

Baby elephants ripped away from their family and shipped off to heaven knows where.  Tortured to perform unnatural stunts for entertainment, reminds me to much of how my ancestors came to this country and why.  It is time to first protect our glorious inhabitants in the wild and to put an end to entertainment use of animals...all animals in a circus.

Even zoos like our National Zoo here in the Nation's Capital has some fairly heartbreaking exhibits.  Especially the great apes exhibit. Clearly many of the primates have serious mental health issues.  Wouldn't you? The back and forth movements of the elephants mirrors the movements of some of the animals in this film.  It's very disheartening.  I strongly recommend that you show this documentary to your children if you have any.  They can become powerful advocates when their attention is called early on to the suffering of these and other wildlife held in zoos. Spend your entertainment time and money on shows like Cirque Du Soleil and other spectacular shows that don't use animal slaves.

I agree with one of the statements, saying something to the effect that is not normal for wild Elephants to walk on their back legs, putting their faces to the ground with their legs in the air. It's unnatural to take them out of the wild to make them do things that aren't natural to do. Abuse is abuse and those who have abused these precious Elephants will be judged by God. They should be loved and treated with the greatest respect, nothing less.  Such sadness I felt as I watched men and women touch Elephants with metal rods in delicate places. Sometimes it was shown a man or woman just hitting them! That's wrong. Wrong is wrong and will never be right or ok to treat Elephants badly or advising them.

5992956,5,B00FH6V722,"It was disturbing to see such loving and beautiful animals treated so badly. It was touching to hear from people who care about them and what they have done to improve their plight. It was inspiring in that now I want to be part of the solution.

Over and over again as I watched this documentary and listened to the scientists and caretakers speak of their respect and love for elephants it made me want to give them a hug. They all were such lovely people.

Take time out of your weekend to watch this short documentary with your children. You will be glad you did.",1432771200,,567,4.339622641509434
5992957,5,B00FH6V722,The elephants are not trained they are tortured and terrorized into doing very unnatural things.  Painful evil methods are used to break them and 'train' them so a bunch of soul-less losers can get your circus ticket money.  Elephants are also being killed for their ivory because the Chinese can't stop buying stupid ivory trinkets.  Are we all a bunch of idiots or what?,1432598400,2,372,4.78125

5992959,5,B00FH6V722,Very informative. I thought it had an excellent balance between describing the mistreatment of elephants without mincing words yet not making it so heavy it was unbearable to watch.,1426723200,,181,5.275862068965517
5992960,5,B00FH6V722,"Not sure why anyone would give this film less than the full five stars.  Yes, it's difficult at times to watch, but it's the truth.  I went to the circus maybe once in my life when I was very little, and I will never go to them again so long as they have animals performing in this way.  I don't go to zoos either, but that's a different subject.  The next time I see an elephant it will most likely be on an African safari where they're free to roam in the wild.",1425513600,,463,3.946236559139785

That condition is now changing rapidly, but to no improvement on a global scale where elephants are hunted for their ivory mostly for processing in asian countries.

8615769,5,B00FH6V722,great documentary that raises awareness of the plight of elephants in the wild and in circuses and shows an unbiased view. I like how they show that some zoos will go above and beyond to put the elephants first and give them the  best quality of life possible. They are not performers and they do not belong in circuses,1495324800,,319,4.406779661016949
8615770,5,B00FH6V722,I just showed this to a group of 5th graders who are reading The One and Only Ivan. It gave them a good history of how elephants have been treated and related well to the book.

8615775,5,B00FH6V722,This documentary was a real eye opener and reminder to me about the treatment of performance and zoo kept animals. I was very heavy hearted to learn how the animals were forced with such violence all just for monetary profit. I think everyone should at least watch this once.,1485820800,,275,4.63265306122449
