2073497,3,B0002AL1ME,Interesting early Mickey Rooney film with hints of Andy Hardy.,1431820800,,62,5.3
2073498,3,B0002AL1ME,"Interesting little low budget film released on dvd by Alpha Home Video.  This is actually a dvd-r. Picture quality is a little murky (typical for Alpha Videos).  Alpha has a little white ""Alpha"" logo that keeps showing up in the bottom corner of the picture.  If you like the Andy Hardy series, you'll enjoy giving this a look.",1377993600,,327,4.603448275862069

2073500,5,B0002AL1ME,My family and I really like Mickey Rooney when he first started out acting and this movie was a good one. We were not disappointed at all and would like to add this one to our collection since we watched it on-line. Check it out and you will probably agree that is a good old classic film.,1366934400,3,289,4.087719298245614
2073501,5,B0002AL1ME,This movie is a nice little film. This is one of Mickey's first films.  He is shown a lot in the movie.  The movie is actually quite touching.  Especially the relationship with mickey and his father.  Mickey is very proud of his father in this movie although he is a drunk.  His father had served in the war and has mental problems from his time there.  If you like Mickey Rooney as I do them you will enjoy this little movie.....,1106956800,,430,4.246913580246914
