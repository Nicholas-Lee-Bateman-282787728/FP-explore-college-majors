2268838,5,B00097C4B2,"I found ""Save Your Lower Back,""  a totally effective and user friendly program which alleviates common issues of the lower back, hips and thighs. Best yet, it is gentle enough for anyone who can sit on the floor and use gentle stretching. I find myself using this program several times a week and I wish to recommend it to anyone who leads a sedentary lifestyle which can shorten important muscles groups. In turn, it appears I found relief for my sciatica issues.

This program brings awareness to stabilizing the psoas muscle and those surrounding.  Strengthening the core means a strong healthy back and strong thighs. The program begins with relaxation of the muscles of the lower back allowing them to relax so that strengthening exercises can become effective. The concept here is, ""how can you strengthen tight muscles?"" These exercises allow chiropractic adjustments and massages to become more effective, of which I am a huge fan.

The 45 minute program includes these sections: Annette's welcome, an illustrated explanation of the location and function of the muscles of the lower back and hips; floor stretches which focus on releasing, strengthening, and stretching the hips, shoulders, lumbar area and lower back.

I have used all of Annette Fletchers previous programs with positive results, and this now is my favorite.",1303257600,67,1334,5.129032258064516
2268839,5,B00097C4B2,"I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer.  This is a dvd for every level.  Unlike her previous Joint Mobility dvd, which could be difficult for older adults and the inflexible, these exercises can be done by anyone at any age.  Everything is done at a relaxed and easy pace.  If you are looking for a dvd for a sore, tight back or a tired back from sitting at a computer all day, then this is the dvd for you.",1300752000,56,414,4.2025316455696204
2268840,5,B00097C4B2,"Modern life is hell on our backs. Between the computer and the TV our poor backs are getting stiff and weak, a sitting duck for injury, sitting (or shlumping!) being the operative word. ""Save Your Lower Back"" with Annette Fletcher is a wonderful antidote, and your whole body will thank you, as it stretches and strengthens not just the back but the muscles around the back, and it just makes you feel wonderful all over.

This DVD is made for ordinary people. No matter what kind of shape you're in, you'll get the most out of it. And at 45 minutes (this includes a tutorial of your muscles, as well as an excellent teaching segment on posture) it isn't overwhelming. As a senior, I can vouch for it being perfect for keeping flexibility in a body that if left alone quickly gets creaky and stiff. Along with going to the gym, I'm going to use this DVD regularly, because it really makes me feel fabulous, and you can feel fabulous at any age!

Favorite moves include the breaststroke, and the final heavenly hip stretch. If like me, you find sitting cross-legged hard on your knees, the one exercise that has this position I did with my legs straight out, about a foot apart, and got a lot out of the stretch. Always modify according to what your body can do.

Annette is an expert teacher and knows how to explain each move perfectly. The exercises don't take much room (as much as arms width and full length with your arms stretched overhead) and you'll need a towel or mat for the floor and a towel folded for your head. Quick, simple and effective, this DVD is great!",1300579200,91,1573,4.473867595818815

Something's were difficult for me due to tight hamstrings and soas muscles causing me to have bad cramps when trying g to do the strengthening routines.  If your haven't worked out on the floor or done much stretching go slow as she suggests though.  Perhaps I just need more time and practice.

Seemed to skip a lot of the fundamentals and dive into very advanced and weird techniques. To me it seemed way overkill and only a professional with a lot of time to follow it is going to really get something out of it.

I have bulging discs and some swelling low back and I really like the first part of the dvd to relax my back.  I had spinal decompression which helped some but the exercises in this dvd are helping to strengthen my back to the point where I can ride a bike a few miles and walk 1-2 miles.  I plan to keep on using it to keep strengthening my back.  Just a note, I haven't been able to do the entire dvd yet.

While my back pain isn't as serious, it is still uncomfortable at different times. My doctor told me that certain exercises are important to keep that paid away. I found this hoping to get some relief without having a take constant pain medication. This DVD is great! I feel like I had a good stretching/yoga workout and my back doesn't hurt for the rest of the day. I feel better after doing it. The only negative, which I have read on other reviews, is that there is a lot of talking. But the DVD is in chapters so after listening to the intro once, you can just skip to the good parts.

2268869,3,B00097C4B2,"I don't use this dvd very often because I need more of a full body stretch and this just focuses on the back.
She tells you to go at your own pace and to stop the dvd after she instructs you on how to do the exercise/stretch.
There are pros and cons to that. pro is you don't feel rushed and can take more time if your muscles feel like they need it. The con is that is takes me at least an hour to do this because I am taking my time and too much of it. I am the type that need something that keeps me moving along.
I do like a couple of the exercises and stretches she does and will do those as needed along with the full body stretch i do in the mornings.
Also one other thing that is kind of annoying is camera doesn't give you multiple angles. a couple of times her explanations are confusing and I wish I could see how she was doing it from another angle.",1391731200,2,861,3.8700564971751414

2268872,4,B00097C4B2,Great for bad backs. Almost all the same  excercises my chiropractor recommended. I left off one star because it seemed strange that the gentler warm up was AFTER the strength part. The part where she rolls up and back down is a bit much for those with bad backs and not so strong abs. So I just do crunches during that part with my back safely on the floor. I like her voice and instructions too. Nothing worse than getting a CD and the persons voice is grating.,1383696000,4,463,4.261363636363637

2268876,5,B00097C4B2,"I hope that Annette gets to see this.  I just had to write this review immediately after doing this DVD. It is amazing!! I went to the doctor yesterday because I have been having pain, stiffness and numbness in my lower back and my left leg.  I have recently starting running and I was very upset because this has prevented me from running.  I am trying to lose weight and I thought that I was not going to be able to do anything active again.  The MD told me that she thinks it is sciatica or a herniated disc.  I have not had my MRI yet so we don't know for sure.

I purchased this DVD about a month ago and had not used it yet.  I bought it because I know that I need to incorporate stretching into my routine.  So today I decided to do it in the hopes that I could ease some of the pain and stiffness in my back and leg.

OH MY GOD!! When I started the video, I was stiff, in some pain and could barely get down on the floor. But, as I did the exercises I could feel my muscles releasing and the stiffness and pain subsided.  When I was done I felt like I had just come from the chiropractor!  I feel amazing!! I can stand up straight and I can walk around my house with a lot less pain and stiffness.  There is still a little there but nothing compared to how I had been feeling for the past 4 days.  I am so impressed by this DVD and this is only after doing it ONE TIME!!  I am getting your other DVDs so I can do more stretching.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!

2268896,4,B00097C4B2,"I am in my mid-40s, and over the past few years, I have had several episodes of lower back pain.  Given this, I thought this DVD would be helpful to add to my collection.  Instructor Annette Fletcher is a certified Pilates instructor, certified personal trainer, and modern dancer.  She incorporates some elements of both Pilates and yoga into this stretch workout, but she moves at a very slow, measured pace.  Fletcher is featured working out alone and providing live instruction.

The Main Menu offers options for Welcome, Muscles of the Lower Back & Hips, Release, Strengthen, Stretch, Posture; there is also additional information on Fletcher and her DVDs plus credits and disclaimer.  The Welcome and Muscles are each brief overview segments provided by Fletcher.  I have given descriptions of the remaining segments below:

RELEASE (5.5 minutes)
Fletcher begins lying in constructive rest, simply allowing gravity to release the psoas muscles.  Next comes knee in, other leg moving out extensions.  This is followed by stretching the arms overhead while keeping the pelvic area stable.

STRENGTHEN (18 minutes)
Lying on the back, Fletcher starts this segment with a pelvic tilt, moving into several different bridge variations.  Coming into seated, she performs a half roll back to release the spine.  Next, she moves to the hands and knees for scapular isolations.  Remaining in this position, she performs leg lifts, then moves into alternating arms and legs.  Coming down onto her side, Fletcher performs side leg raises, circles, and small kicks.  To finish, she comes onto her stomach for leg lifts, breast stroke, and elbow plank.

STRETCH (11 minutes)
Fletcher starts this segment on hands and knees for cat/cow stretches, adding a knee in and up.  This is followed by a seated cross-legged forward bend.  Coming to a lying position, Fletcher performs a cross leg stretch and a lying twist.  She concludes with pigeon pose to stretch the hips.

POSTURE (3.5)
From a standing position, Fletcher reviews important components of proper posture, such as distributing the weight evenly on the feet and keeping the thighs back.

Overall, I found this DVD to be very well done.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Strengthen portion was not too easy, as many of the therapeutic workouts that I have tried wind up being too gentle for me given that I am an experienced exerciser.  I do wish that Fletcher had given some guidance on how the workout segments could be used separately:  she states only that you need to release before you can strengthen and stretch.  Done in its entirety, however, the entire practice is about 35 minutes long--quite a bit of time to devote to a therapeutic practice.

Still, I have done this entire practice several times in the last week.  Unfortunately, I have not yet experienced any pain relief.  This may be because my current areas of discomfort are more in my hip/side waist, but I had still been hopefully that this DVD might help.  I will continue to use it, and as I do think it would be likely to help most with back pain, I would recommend it.",1352592000,68,3106,4.94015444015444

So, I started researching on-line exercises that would strengthen my back.  I was very pleased with the reviews for this DVD so I purchased it.  I've been using the DVD every day for the past 2 weeks.  I know it'll take time to improve the area of my back that's giving me issues; however, I've already noticed that I've gained some lower back strength just in how my body has responded to the exercises. Initially, some of them I couldn't do very comfortably and others I thought ""I can't do this"" but in both cases I've proved myself wrong.

There is also a section at the end of the DVD that talks about posture and guides you through the proper way to stand.  The more I use this section, the more I automatically know when my posture is incorrect. Also, between correct posture and the exercises I'm responding differently in how I use my back for every day activities.

What I was very impressed with was the instructor's ability to articulate how to do the exercise and breath.  Also, the speed at which the exercises are done are just about right, not too fast or too slow.  The music is Zen like so its very relaxing.",1341792000,14,1338,4.40650406504065
2268902,5,B00097C4B2,"this dvd is AWESOME for the lower back. I did it very consistenly for several months. I no longer do it but I still do certain stretch in this dvd for my lower back and tight hips. I will probably go back to it if I get really bad back pain again.

its very good, very therapeutic. you'll learn lots more about your lower back, anatomy, etc.",1336176000,7,341,4.08955223880597
2268903,2,B00097C4B2,instructor seems nice but does not help or remind about breath and her voice is sort of sorority girl - a bit annoying - could not recommend it - it all seems a bit rushed for newbie,1332979200,4,182,3.945945945945946
2268904,5,B00097C4B2,"I like this DVD because it is slow and relaxing.  The ocean waves make it easy to relax and the instructor's voice is easy to listen to.  The exercises are just what I needed for my back pain. I am 65.  It saved me a lot of money since the co pay on phyisical therapy was more than I could pay.
Thank you.",1326067200,20,305,3.8095238095238093

8057798,5,B00097C4B2,"I bought this CD to help out my lower back. Some of the exercises are the same ones I used when I had to go to back therapy and some are new. I like that this instructor on the tape is easy to follow and understand. The stretches are pretty easy and you can adjust some of the stretches or exercises for wherever you are for your body. So, if you are less limber, you can adjust the exercise. The CD is 40 min.'s long, in three parts. I have issues with my lower back so this CD is perfect. I started using it as soon as I got it.",1478217600,2,530,3.827272727272727
