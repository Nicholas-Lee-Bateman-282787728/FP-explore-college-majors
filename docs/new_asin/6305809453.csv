7895866,5,6305809453,"The episodes picked for this box set are great, But if your looking for the ""Collectors Cards that came with the first 7 box sets THINK AGAIN! As far as I can tell this final Box set in the series does not come with the six collectors cards. If I happen to be wrong about this please let me know. [...]I feel that the cards are one of the coolest things about this series and was looking forward to finishing my collection, but I guess I may have already finishd it.",1115856000,2,466,4.131868131868132
7895867,5,6305809453,"The ""X Files"" amazing fourth season contained some of the best episodes in the series history and Fox has included a number of them in their series of triple box sets.
Wave 8 includes the incredible ""Small Potatoes"" which boasts both a fabulous script by the amazingly talented Vince Gilligan and an award winning calibre performance by David Duchovny; the wildly outrageous ""Leonard Betts"" which has some great Mulder-Scully interplay and wild special effects; also included is the elaborately produced two parter: ""Tempus Fugit""-""Max"", which though a conspiracy based story, avoids all the annoying qualities of the usual ""X"" mythology episodes (there's no heavy handed speeches and no appearances by the ""cancer"" or ""well manicured"" man, all of which overstayed their welcome by the time season 4 began).
""Tempus Fugit and ""Max"" also boast the production values of a Hollywood feature...the re-creation of the plane crash site is incredibly well done.
The ""X-Files"" in its heyday, was one of the hippest,most subversive shows in the history of television, and the two Season 4 box sets (who can forget the Peacock Brothers and their insatiable Mama?) are video time capsules of a great era.",1007251200,2,1193,5.186528497409326
7895868,5,6305809453,"This new box set of VHS tapes contains some of the most memorable episodes of the series, in my opinion.  Who could forget ""Small Potatoes,"" and Luke Skywalker's lightsaber?  I think the question that episode raises in the mind of every 'Shipper is, ""If that had really been Mulder and not Van Blundht, would Scully have given it up?""
In the more serious episodes, we find out about Scully's cancer.  And then, of course, the climatic cliffhanger episode ""Gethesmane.""  When that episode originally aired at the end of the fourth season, that summer was the longest summer of my life.  I could not wait to find out what REALLY happened to Mulder.  ""Gethesmane"" leads into Season 5, one of the best seasons of the show.
Over all, this is a nice box set.  I received mine for Christmas, actually.  My only complaint is that it's not DVD.  Still, the episodes chosen for this set are the best of the season--a nice blend of comedic, gross, scary, sad, and simply dramatic.",979516800,18,969,4.652941176470589
7895869,5,6305809453,"Ok, personally, I have loved almost, ALMOST every single one of the X-Files episodes up to now, and I can't wait for next season!  I love how they put the most interesting and most loved episodes on tape. Eg,  Memento Mori and Leonard Betts, mememorable episodes for any true fan,  Small Potatoees for that almost kiss with Mulder's look alike, the  intriguing yet enjoyable Tempus Fugit/Max, and the cliffhanger of  Gesetheme. I am upset that it took them so long to bring these out and also  very upset they don't have the cards any more, but I do love the episodes,  so all in all, great show, great tapes!",959731200,8,609,4.532110091743119
7895870,5,6305809453,"I don't know what that one reviewer Lee was talking about when referring to Tempus Fugit/Max.  The two-parter included in this set is phenomenal. If you ever wonder what it is like to be in a plane crash, Tempus Fugit/Max  will show you what it's like. That's not all either, this two-parter,  though not tied in with the Mythology, is one of my favorites, it has all  the aspects that got me to watch the X-files way back in season  one,...aliens, conspiracy, dark government officials, cover-up...you name  it. Leonard Betts and Memento Mori continue the development of Scully's  cancer. Small Potatoes, the comical take on the ability to change  appearance,..all superb writing in this season. And Gethsemane,..I could  watch this one over and over! I have nothing bad to say. Season 4 and  season 6 have been two of the best seasons,..and thanks to the DVD releases  coming soon, we are going to be able to have all of the episodes from these  two...as well as all the other, seasons.",959558400,8,988,4.747058823529412
7895871,5,6305809453,"First of all the latest wave has taken way too long to appear  (a year and a month)...and as a previous reviewer noted, the cards are no longer there...though the boxes for Season 4 have been the best ever.  As for the  episodes:  Tempus Fugit and Max had to appear, though they are hardly that  entertaining.  Gethsemane, Leonard Betts, and Memento Mori are necessary  viewing AND entertaining.  Do note that Vince Gilligan's introduction to  Memento Mori has a glaring error:  Memento Mori means ""Remember to  die"", NOT ""Memo to the Dead""...and the real Latin meaning  makes far more sense as the episode title.  Small Potatoes is perhaps the  best of the fourth season and were it not to be here the whole concept of  the waves should be abandoned.  But we still would like to see Musings of a  Cigarette Smoking Man and Elegy  (the most hauntingly beautiful of the  cancer episodes)...and as for the DVDs, the last reviewer is right...no way  before 2003 for Season 4.",958262400,16,972,4.706586826347305
7895872,5,6305809453,"Since 1993 The X-Files has made fans eager to see what is going to happen in the ongoing saga that occurs each weekend. For many this may be the only show worth watching even and in fact buying merchandise for. The first two  waves introduced us to the show in the old days of the show when the  effects were not as good, but the storylines were quite original and  ""spooky."" However, now the DVD's for the first season have been  released and are quite amazing. Soon enough DVD's will be released for each  of the following seasons. That will lead the dedicated fans to thinking if  it is really worth buying anything past the 4th season's waves. I, as a  dedicated viewer, own the first 8 waves, the movie on VHS & DVD, and  Season One on DVD along with some books and collectible figures.
The only  thing that really bothered me about Wave 8 was the fact that it no longer  has the collectible cards that I have so much enjoyed receiving with each  tape that I have previously purchased (total of 44 cards). That is all of  the low points. The selection was very well made for the 2nd half of  possibly the best season of the show, a much better selection than Wave 7.  I was happy to see that Tunguska/Terma was on the tape, but that was  actually expected. The only disappointment was that Home was chosen rather  than Musings of a Cigarrette Smoking Man.
Wave 8 comes in a very classy  case, and these VHS tapes are of very good quality. However, when Season 4  comes out on DVD the VHS tapes will remain on my shelves just as a  decoration since DVD is so far superior. I suggest that big fans of the  show purchase this wave since it will probably not be on DVD in any time  less than three years. For people who want to catch up with the show to  understand it better, I suggest for them to rent the episodes instead.  Leonard Betts is one of the best episodes ever created, directed by no  other than Kim Manners. The two parter Tempus Fugit / Max is also quite  entertaining. In actuality Wave 9 will be a great wave to also own though  when it is released since it will include Unusual Suspects, when the Lone  Gunmen originally meet (takes place in the past). Now you have something  else to look forward to possibly at the end of this year or sometime next  year. Until then, if you purchased Season One on DVD and/or Wave 8 enjoy  those episodes along with any previous waves that you have purchased. Also  remember to watch the last few episodes that are aired at 9 ET / 8 Central  on Sundays. If we are lucky, David Duchovny may sign a contract to reprise  his roll as Fox Mulder. Keep your fingers crossed. At least Chris Carter is  planning on directing some movies. Season 7 has been a disappointment to  me, but I believe there are still ideas that he has that he wants to save  for later on.",957916800,29,2813,4.301526717557252
