Instructor deadpan, with no personality.  We are accustomed to using the Shawn Trautman DVDs, which are excellent; instructors dynamic and engaging, multiple views with plenty of useful repetition, but they don't unfortunately have a Samba DVD.  Don't buy this. It's a waste of money.",1482364800,,432,5.217391304347826

8350024,5,B0023S49SG,"My husband and I have taken Ballroom dance lessons on and off over the years.  Because of busy lives and a lack of places to actually go out dancing we would forget a lot of what we learned.  Also, because Community College dance classes try to cover multiple dances into an 8 week session, you learn bits and pieces to each style never quite sure how to put it all together.  So I purchased this dvd to be able to focus on one dance at a time and we are very pleased with the results.  This dvd is clear and precise, showing man and woman steps individually.  A variety of moves are presented to create an interesting routine.
Routines are even shown if you don't want, or know how, to put the different moves together. The Cha Cha for example covers the Closed Basic, Underarm turn, New Yorks, Spot Turns, Time Steps, Hand to Hands, The Fan, Hockey Stick, Open Basic Lock Step, Open Hip Twist and the Alamana.  I would say the lessons taught here are beginner to intermediate.  It is much easier to learn to dance in the comfort of your own home at your own pace.  I highly recommend this set.",1413158400,,1095,4.333333333333333
