JUDGMENT CALL:

""GREEK - CHAPTER FOUR"" continues to focus on the second half of the second season and this time around focuses on friendships and relationships and the turning point of certain characters.

Casey having to deal with her personal ambitions to prepare for her career after college but then also having to deal with her emotions as she cares for both Max and Cappie.  Ashleigh deals with her leadership at ZBZ but also finding new love.  Rusty finds a girl that he falls for but knowing that a frat brother Andy (played by Jesse McCartney) likes her as well.  Frannie wanting to get back at her former ZBZ sisters while running the IKI sorority.  And this is just a few of the characters, many of them face major decisions that will definitely set things up for the third season.

Overall, ""GREEK: CHAPTER FOUR"" was an enjoyable second half for the series.  As mentioned, the writers did a solid job of building on character development and instead of focusing on just Casey and Rusty's adventures in college, giving the other characters more lines and stories to develop their character.  But most of all, building up this tension that would definitely come full force in the season finale.

""GREEK"" is an entertaining and fun college comedy featuring a fun group of characters.  Check it out!",1268179200,11,5813,4.825734549138804

4042511,3,B002ZTQW3S,"This is the 4th installment of the Greek DVD set and contains the last half if the 2nd season. If you want to know how season 2 ends... this is the only way. I'm not a fan of the fragmented release and I was hoping for full season sets to come out, but so far no dice. Great show though.

If you are a fan of the show I would recommend buying this and the other sets (because speaking as a slightly unwilling participant I actually enjoy watching this show whenever my wife has it on). If you are not a fan already, don't buy this set, but check out the first set and see what you think. That said the show is funny and the characters are interesting enough (a few you love and want to see where they end up; some you love to hate and want to see fall hard. Check it out, see if you like it and enjoy. : )",1364947200,,805,3.878787878787879

4042514,1,B002ZTQW3S,"I bought this a year or so ago and was looking forward to receiving it. Got it promptly but just took a while to get around to writing a review but I finally got annoyed enough to comment.

Greek is a fantastic show and this set contains some of my favourite episode but the discs themselves are complete garbage. They are cheaply made and my PC will not read them (except for one which gets a partial read). I just downloaded the episodes over bittorrent in the end rather than pay twice.",1355788800,2,489,4.315217391304348
