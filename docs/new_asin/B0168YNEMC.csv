8735842,5,B0168YNEMC,I absolutely loved this anime! I was a bit aprhensive  to buying this product with the lack of reviews but I'm glad I took a chance. When you first open the case there are only 2 discs. Do not let that scare you! All 26 episodes and both OVAs are there. The only thing I didn't like was that the OVAS are only in Japanese but not a huge deal.,1486252800,,342,3.8857142857142857
