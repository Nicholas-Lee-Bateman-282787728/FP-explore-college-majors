8442366,2,B004UW0LMQ,"I was expecting a horror film, but it's blandness reminded me of some ill-advised family drama.  I made it about until 30 minutes to the end, then I just didn't care what happened.  I did catch the last blip of the end and it was just pointless.  It isn't sure if it wants to be a ghost horror film or a psychiatric drama on Lifetime TV.  I hope the director hasn't made anything else, he's not up to par.",1435276800,,405,4.0886075949367084
