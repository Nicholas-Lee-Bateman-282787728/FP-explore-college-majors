3149162,5,B00160ANQO,"I absolutely love this video. Very relaxing, and it makes you feel incredible. I was looking for some videos to keep in shape while I am pregnant, and this one is one of my favorites. It is long, 50 minutes, so I don't always get all of the way through it because I have other children and alot to do!!! But it is wonderful because all three women in the video are pregnant in different stages of pregnancy, so you can watch them and change your moves if you need to.  I strongly recommend this video to any pregnant woman who is trying to stay in shape while you are pregnant!!",1235347200,8,578,4.207207207207207

3149165,5,B00160ANQO,"I've tried a few different pre-natal yoga videos at this point, and this one is the one that stands out.  The difference with this one is that though I'm familiar with the basics of yoga, I don't quite have the flexibility that is needed for some of the other videos.  This video challenges me at times, yet makes me feel like I can complete it without much strain.  It keeps from being over-athletic, but also from being over-woo-woo.  When I'm done, I have a feeling that it wasn't so hard, but usually feel the stretch the next day when I haven't practiced in awhile.  It is definitely relaxing and strength-building.",1227571200,6,620,4.6
3149166,5,B00160ANQO,"I have been using anna getty's prenatal yoga now for a month and I love it. It is a nice mix of hatha yoga and kundalini yoga... easier to do than Gurmukh's workout (which is also great). Love the music, very relaxing...

thanks anna!!",1225756800,2,235,4.340909090909091

8260615,5,B00160ANQO,Very good dvd for a beginner and pregnancy.,1474329600,,43,4.5
8260616,5,B00160ANQO,"I never did the post preg yoga but the pregnancy yoga is totally worth it- and I tried a lot of videos. The music is soothing, the yoga is accessible to all, and the instructor didn't annoy me.
In my second pregnancy I didn't have all the time for the whole video but I took my favorite poses and stretches and did them on my own.",1448668800,,330,4.015151515151516
8260617,5,B00160ANQO,"This is a perfect pre and post natal yoga video - I'm still doing it and my baby is nearly two!  There's a lot of variety and you build up strength slowly.  She's very calming and sweet, as well.  Buy it, you won't be sorry!",1280880000,2,224,3.933333333333333
8260618,3,B00160ANQO,I bought this video during my pregnancy and it was really relaxing but  I found the Post Natal Yoga workout a little boring:(,1262563200,,125,4.434782608695652
8260619,4,B00160ANQO,"This dvd offers a good balance in challenge and taking it easy, you can feel you have done some exercise, without feeling sore the next day. It really focusses a lot in the back, which I reckon is good since so much extra  weight is going to that area.",1260835200,,252,4.142857142857143
8260620,1,B00160ANQO,"uuuuhm did I mention. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn!!!

If you like yoga then try it. It was my first time trying yoga and it was so boring. To me it was 1 star cause it was dreadful. This is my rating for MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

Rating the product- it works fine and gave no problems. If you like yoga then ignore my review.

Did not make me feel any better about my pregnancy workout either and the reason is surely obvious- I did this almost once. I got too bored to continue.",1259020800,,480,4.370786516853933
8260621,5,B00160ANQO,"This is a great prenatal yoga workout.  It is not strenuous, yet you really feel like you are getting toned while getting loosened up.  Every time I do the workout, I feel better.  There is nothing intimidating, and is good for beginners or experts alike.  I have done several prenatal yoga videos, and this is definitely my favorite!",1256169600,,334,4.706896551724138
8260622,4,B00160ANQO,"Having never done yoga before and looking for something not too crazy, this video fit the bill pretty good but was still looking for something a tad bit more.",1238198400,,158,4.482758620689655
8260623,5,B00160ANQO,"I purchased this dvd along with Gurmukh's.  I really like both and alternate them.  Anna's set is a little less challenging than Gurmukh's, but you can see how Anna learned from her, and the influence is there.

The video is a little long at 50 minutes, but it is time well spent.  The scenery and Anna are beautiful, and the soundtrack is really nice.  I usually use this one when I want a mellow session to stretch my body out after a long day at work, and I use Gurmukh's for a more intense and energizing session.  I still haven't used any of the post-natal workouts, but if they are similar to the pre-natal one I'm sure I'll be pleased.

The other nice thing about the prenatal dvd is it includes extra footage with interviews with a highly regarded pediatrician and also nutritionist.  I typically don't get around to watching the extra footage on videos like this, but I found these ones informative and helpful.

Overall I highly recommend this dvd.  If you would like a calm, soothing yoga workout during pregnancy that makes you just feel GOOD, I recommend this dvd for sure.",1237939200,6,1086,4.551546391752577
8260624,3,B00160ANQO,"I bought this video along with another (Jennifer Wolfe's Vinyasa Short Forms) and I have found that I prefer Wolfe's over this one.

Anna Getty's video is very simplistic and relaxing, but I found it a little boring and it did not take me through a full body yoga practice as I expected. I prefer Vinyasa yoga, as it keeps me moving and stretches my whole body. Anna's video may be good for someone who has not been active at all during (or even before) their pregnancy, and wants to do simple stretches and practice breathing.

For anyone who does any sort of exercise - even walking - on a regular basis, or has done any yoga at all in the past, I recommend Jennifer Wolfe's vinyasa short forms, as it gives many options and modifications for different ability levels and stages of pregnancy, and will strengthen you and grow with you. I have very little experience with yoga and I am not in very good shape, but Wolfe's video was well suited to my needs. I also liked Wolfe's demeanor and music better, and the 5 minute relaxation at the end of each practice. She gives some helpful tips for labor poses, as well. Overall, I found that Anna Getty's video was okay, but Jennifer Wolfe's was much more relaxing, strengthening, inspiring, and interesting.",1237766400,6,1255,4.573333333333333
