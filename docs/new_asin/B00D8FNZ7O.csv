8590564,3,B00D8FNZ7O,"A tad rote addition in the analysis of lost teens gone fully astray, ""N.Y.C. Underground"" has one saving ground in yet another strong performance by Evan Ross. Evan practically owns the prototype of the teen soul fighting the injustices of being without marked family support forcing him to make a life without much of a blueprint in how.
Thankfully, Evan's much more higher profile as music producer in the recent VH1 movie, ""CrazySexyCool"". He is on screen for a large portion of the movie and similar to his praised role in ""Mooz-u-lum"", he keeps the cameras interest without much dialogue just a near silent movie performance that demonstrates his versatility.
With the demise of the video rental market where these straight to video movies had a small, but, dedicated audience, it will be interesting to see how studios like Lions Gate wins back fans. A lot of these movies do play on secondary premium video channels like Starz and Encore. Though I rarely watch programming on those channels, they are offered in most cable packages as a bonus so hopefully they have gained a more dedicated audience than a first rate moviegoer like I would ever be.l
In fairness, the movie does have a level of suspense and excitement that should have earned more praise than it gets here. While the ensemble cast is trying to escape from the subway tunnels, it certainly had me captive.",1385078400,,1377,4.838983050847458
8590565,2,B00D8FNZ7O,"This movie has cookie cutter written all over it. Fortunately it does offer the small twist of a location that isn't used often and makes for some effective scenes. That being said, don't expect the world from this film but simply a somewhat entertaining standard direct to DVD feature.

A group of late teens from well to do families set out for a night on the town. Leader Dylan has heard of a new one on the Bronx, not the nicest area to frequent, and gets them to go. In reality Dylan has talked with his chauffer who deals on the side about making a connection with his supplier, a truly evil bad guy named Siman. During their discussion Siman reveals that the chauffer has turned evidence against him and orders the two of them killed. Of course Dylan escapes with the help of his brother Logan and the chase begins.

The teens try to get into the limo to leave just as the chauffer pops off the rooftop and lands on the roof. From there, they're on foot and head to the subway to escape. With the bad guy's henchmen in hot pursuit, they choose to jump down to the tracks and see if they can find a way out. This is where the ""underground"" of the title kicks in. The world of the subway tunnels and abandoned locations make for some creepy sequences involving not just rats the size of cats but those who dwell in this netherworld as well.

You can pretty much guess that not all of the kids will survive and it might make a good drinking game betting on which one will go first to last. The same could hold true for the various thugs employed by Siman who follow them down into the underground. All in all that might make for a more enjoyable film that really isn't all that bad...but not all that good either.

The one shining light in the film is the performance of Clayne Crawford as Siman. He doesn't overdo the role and instead lets the character permeate with a sinister side that becomes scary on its own. You might recognize Crawford from the TV series THE GLADES where he portrays Ray Cargill of from an earlier performance in the series 24. He's someone to keep an eye on.",1378944000,2,2089,4.348717948717948
8590566,2,B00D8FNZ7O,"I watched this because it had an interesting premise and featured a female lead who's been great playing tough girls.  Unfortunately it fails to deliver.  First: she's playing the opposite of a tough girl.  Second: while this movie is somewhat realistic in that a group of teenage d-bags trying to escape a street gang would definitely run around like headless chickens, there is no way a group like that should have survived more than 30 seconds.  I am also surprised anyone thought watching a group like that would be interesting.  All the characters have fleeting moments of insight, but only the male lead's brother seems to have any actual intelligence.  I don't know if this ratio is typical of teens in other parts of the US, but in NYC high school seniors who don't have at least some idea on how to escape a pursuer/mugger/rapist/murder are pretty rare.  Admittedly one of the things taught was exactly what they did: run to the nearest subway station because they are usually staffed.  And I can buy why that didn't work out.  But then, the biggest one of all: if you get the upper hand DO AS MUCH DAMAGE AS POSSIBLE because you're not getting it again?  Nope, back to headless chickens.  I get that they might be reluctant to kill anyone... but shooting them in the leg is good enough, no way they can keep up after that...  *sigh*.

It *did* impress me by managing to unseat Money Train as the worst movie set primarily in a subway... so that's something :).",1378425600,,1470,4.607692307692307
8590567,2,B00D8FNZ7O,"Not so great stereotypic acting where teens make unrealistic stupid choices (a cheap plot trick to keep the action moving) while running within an abandoned subway system from bad people. Unlike most storylines of this type they, for the most part, undeservedly escape. Usual stereotypes of girls screaming at rats, guys acting both cowardly and like tough guys while making doesn't-make-sense actions, wrong actions and non-actions.
Had potential, but subway chases is been-done old.",1378080000,,484,5.554054054054054
8590568,1,B00D8FNZ7O,"wow this was boring, senseless and a huge waste of time.  could have been good, w/ rich kids, drug dealers, nigh clubs and a night spent in the subway running from bad guys.....  but it was not, they killed main characters but that was ok because you don't care about them....",1378080000,,276,4.392156862745098
8590569,2,B00D8FNZ7O,"Dylan (Rob Mayes) is the BMOC at his private east side high school, but when he parties with 5 friends in Brooklyn, he finds a different world. It seems the bad guy (Sean Faris) is worried about the FBI investigating his drug dealing and doesn't trust anyone. The film turns into a cat and mouse chase in the NYC subway underground. Clearly this is a film for the younger generation. While running away for their lives, one of the teens laments that she may die a virgin. This is not a film that needs a message or meaningful dialouge.

The film has a lot of drug use, showing this younger generation improperly mixing their highs, although a good adrenaline rush all of a sudden sobers everyone up.

Might make for a decent rental for a young adult. I was bored with most of the film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1377907200,,828,4.434210526315789

After some uptown Manhattan teenagers find themselves crossways with a gangster drug-lord at a party in Brooklyn, they flee to the darkened subways and are pursued by the drug-lord and his cohorts.

I rented NYC UNDERGROUND, thinking it would probably turn out to be just another seedy-corny ultra-violent thriller. While it fits that description in many ways, this film immediately immersed me in its realistic acting, script, and cinematography. The teenagers, wild and somewhat privileged, are nevertheless convincing and defy the stereotypes so easily attached to characters of their sort.

Though quite suspenseful, NYC UNDERGROUND follows a simple and fairly predictable storyline with small but effective surprises in certain key spots. It's not as satisfying as it might have been, and they could have been a little more creative with the ending in particular. Still, crime thriller fans who aren't too demanding should find it a compelling experience and might even really, really like it. This film is a superb example of ""low budget appeal.""

SEMI-SPOILERS BELOW!

NYC UNDERGROUND might have been enhanced with some brief midway glances at the outside world, i.e., the discovery of the body on the limo and what happens with the friend they leave behind at the party. There are also a few unlikely stretches, e.g., the crackheads' intervention at the end. Though I realize that it would have complicated things and is probably something we're supposed to be left to speculate upon, I also would have liked a quick peak at the aftermath of all of this.",1377734400,,1575,5.1607843137254905
