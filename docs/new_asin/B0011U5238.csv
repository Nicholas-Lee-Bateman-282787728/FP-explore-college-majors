8242312,4,B0011U5238,"GANG OF SOULS provides short interviews with leading poets of the Beat Generation and also with some of those they have inspired such as Lydia Lunch, Richard Hell and Jim Carroll. A variety of topics are discussed with each poet commenting on their take on that topic. One of the good points about this film is that it focusses on several women of the Beat movement as well as on the men. It is not a documentary and does not try to place the Beats in their historical context, but interviews with such luminaries as Gregory Corso, William Burroughs, John Giorno, Allen Ginsberg and others (not so much interviews as short snippets) give a taste of the individuals style, themes and approach of each of these poets. Probably not a good introductory item for those who know little about the Beat generation, but an interesting adjunct for a Beat collection.",1396310400,,856,4.713333333333333
