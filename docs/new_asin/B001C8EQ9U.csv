8286272,5,B001C8EQ9U,"The 3 movies here are

The Day After Tomorrow
Donnie Darko
The Good Girl

I only know of the Day After Tomorrow, which I thought was great. The other 2 I don't know about. At any rate, I am just writing the review to let people know whats on this collection. However, to the impatient people that have to write a bad review about amazon... (and NO I DONT WORK FOR AMAZON) I do agree that they should be describing their products in better detail for a page like this, because its not the only one obviously that lacks details.

However for this one in particular, the 3 movie titles are in the picture of the item itself. Some people are just so frickin impatient and ignorant and have to have the answer right there in front of their face.

But Amazon, YALL need to actually start describing some of your products in much better detail. Some are great, but there are quite a few that are very much lacking.",1259712000,10,907,4.317647058823529

8286274,3,B001C8EQ9U,"What's amazon doing here?
There is no product description, what films are they putting on this compilation?
I had to zoom in on the cover to find out.
Come on Amazon, get it together!",1231977600,,183,4.411764705882353
