It adequately captures a child's thought process and thus it is interesting to watch...because through Jacob's eyes the hooded fang is scary and Jacob's sudden bravery is thus quite admirable. My favorite aspect of the film, though, was how nobody listened to Jacob, so he had to say everything twice. To me, that's quite sad...but so real in a way too.",991440000,,426,5.014084507042254

8039928,1,B00067Z2KU,"""Jacob Two Two Meets The Hooded Fang"" is a painful experience with a lot of talent utterly squandered in one of the least appealing kid's movies imaginable. I give it one star and would give it less if possible. Jacob Two Two is a six year old who wants to prove he's capable of running errands, so his annoyed father sends him to a grocery store full of psychopaths who taunt him for no reason and then sing a song about produce (""Two! Firm! Red! Tomatoes!"") that sadly is reprised later in the film and is, even more sadly, not the worst song in the movie. For whatever crime it is a six year old could possibly commit by purchasing tomatoes in a slight voice, Jacob is sentenced by rapping judge Ice-T (!) to two years, two months, two weeks, two days, two hours, two minutes, and five seconds in a children's prison on Slimer's Island run by insane wrestler ""The Hooded Fang"" played creepily (especially when he sings about eating spiders) by Gary Busey and his two accomplices, Mr. Fish (Mark McKinney) and Miss Fowl, played by the talented Miranda Richardson who here sports a beak, clucks a song like a chicken, and eventually explodes in a flurry of feathers.

I cannot for the life of me understand why you would show this to a child, or why a child would like it. Being harassed when you go out of your house, being surrounded by exclusively insane and untrustworthy adults, Ice-T rapping your prison sentence, an existence dominated by filth, slime, and zero compassion...what's not to love? There's a tortuous subplot about faux miniature Power Rangers, here called the ""Child Power Masters"", and Jacob gets a mechanical bug that's actually, well, a bug. As in a communication device; for convenience the film refers to it as Agent XJ-47, because that sounds better, right? The worst scene in the film comes when Jacob sings a lamentation in his jail cell: oh, the pathos. This is rivalled only by the scene in which Miss Fowl shows her crush on The Hooded Fang, going as far as to call him ""the wind beneath my wings"". (Sorry, I just threw up in my mouth a little there.)

Now you may be wondering why the film is called ""Jacob Two Two"", as I was. It's because Jacob repeats everything he says twice: this does not get old at all. His quiet nature and demeanor and his speech problem leads the Hooded Fang to sentence Jacob to be fed to the crocodiles. This is another good reason to show this to kids: if you are in any way different you should be killed, preferably by reptilian ingestion. Also be sure not to miss the scene glorifying animal abuse in which Busey punishes his dog on a whim for no reason. As all kid's movies do, there is a big finale wrapping up loose ends in the last couple of minutes of the film and everything turns out all right. In a touching one on one with Jacob, The Hooded Fang reveals he's mean because he doesn't like people laughing at him. Thank goodness the philosophy of a six year old is all he needs to right his world. Because he has now seen the light thanks to Jacob, The Hooded Fang closes up shop, sends all the kids home to their parents, and is for the first time in his life truly happy. Because of his bravery the Child Power Masters make Jacob Agent XJ-22, and there is a reprise of ""Two Firm Red Tomatoes"" as the film snaps back to reality in the squalid grocery store (you knew that was coming).

""Jacob Two Two Meets The Hooded Fang"" is a truly odious children's film that I would never dream of showing to kids. Kids too young would be pointlessly frightened; kids too old to be frightened would be merely annoyed.",1439683200,,3579,4.452743902439025
8039929,2,B00067Z2KU,"""Return to Frogtown"" is a film about frogs trying to conquer the world. I give it three stars for camp value (it is far better than the subsequent ""Toad Warrior."") This film follows the adventures of the ""Texas Rocket Rangers"" and their attempt to quell discipline problems in Frogtown. Right off the bat Ranger John Jones (Lou Ferrigno), gets captured by the frogs and is given frog serum to start the transformation process by a weasely scientist, Professor Tanzer, who reminded me of Carrot Top, though without the charm, intellect, or eloquence. More Rangers are dispatched including Robert Z'Dar (whose chin is truly of epic proportions) and ""Dr. Spangle,"" who gets to partially undress and dance for Czar Frogmeister (who sits under an old fashioned hairdryer with a vacuum cleaner hose protrusion, in an ultra-cheap Darth Vader knockoff) in a scene of truly disturbing proportions.

Along the way the plot evolves to have many subcomponents. I greatly enjoy the crabby Chief Ranger ""Captain Delano"" (Charles Napier, a character actor everyone will recognize), a computer named ""F.U.Z.Z.Y."" which is an automated bleached blonde (the acronym is never revealed, unless I was dozing), a disco scene that must be seen to be believed, and a rapping frog band (""I'm mean, I'm green...."") For sheer disturbing, though, nothing can rival the least appealing love scene in movie history in which Robert Z'Dar romances a frog.

Ironically Ferrigno turns a beautiful shade of Hulk green and gets strong enough to break the bars of his jail cell in yet another throwback to earlier works in the genre. The film features dune buggy races, and the lamest rocket backpacks since Commando Cody (""The King of the Rocketmen"") took to the screen decades ago. The helmet of the suit is about the silliest thing I have ever seen, and makes whoever is wearing it look like a flying Duck Billed Platypus. Ultimately the film ends in a long shootout, the mystery of Czar Frogmeister is revealed (it is even dumber than you expect,) and the Rangers get a very annoying apprentice which foreshadows the screen presence of ""Rollergator.""

The film is (obviously) not well made, but unlike many other films in the genre it has a combination of bizarre quirkiness and high camp value that make it enjoyable to the connoisseur of trash cinema.

""Jacob Two Two Meets The Hooded Fang"", on the other hand, is a painful experience with a lot of talent and money utterly squandered in one of the least appealing kid's movies imaginable. I give it one star and would give it less if possible; it's the reason the two-movie DVD gets a paltry two star score overall. Jacob Two Two is a six year old who wants to prove he's capable of running errands, so his annoyed father sends him to a grocery store full of psychopaths who taunt him for no reason and then sing a song about produce (""Two! Firm! Red! Tomatoes!"") that sadly is reprised later in the film and is, even more sadly, not the worst song in the movie.

""Jacob Two Two Meets The Hooded Fang"" is a truly odious children's film that I would never dream of showing to kids. Kids too young would be pointlessly frightened; kids too old to be frightened would be merely annoyed. I don't know why these two films are paired together on one DVD, but if you buy this, enjoy ""Return to Frogtown"" for the cheap and weird B-movie that it is, and then throw the disc away before you're tempted to watch ""Jacob Two Two Meets The Hooded Fang"".",1439683200,,6259,4.623201438848921
8039930,4,B00067Z2KU,"This review is for the four movie set of Jacob Two Two Meets The Hooded Fang/Tommy And The Cool Mule/Mee-See/Fish Tales selling for less than eight dollars.  Two good and two decent movies for the price of one.  Definitely a family friendly set.  Most kids will enjoy them all and adults will probably enjoy Tommy And The Cool Mule and possibly Mee-See.

8039931,5,B00067Z2KU,"A fun little family movie with some cheesy comedy and 'alice in wonderland' type feel to it. I remember seeing it on TV years ago and was happy to find it on DVD, boy did it bring back the memories. Good cast and a fun watch!",1303516800,,225,3.9130434782608696
8039932,2,B00067Z2KU,"If you are a fan of the animated Jacob Two Two series seen on Qubo and Ion TV, this movie will be quite a disappointment. There is none of the magic or wit of the TV series to be found anywhere in this adaptation. The biggest problem with this production is that it's almost all scary stuff with Jacob in some sort of nightmare world. The supportive family and humor of the TV show are nowhere to be found. I take it back, the very biggest problem is the use of super low budget production values and scripting in favor of big-ish name actors in this production. Too often, Mark McKinney, Miranda Richardson, Gary Busey, and Ice-T are framed from afar with nothing to do but rant and gesture in attempts to revive the half baked-not clever-boring script. Yes, I know it's just a kid's movie. Yes I know there is great history and love for Jacob. I'm a huge fan of the animated TV series and I was really looking forward to showing this to my niece and nephew the next time they visit. My wife and I agree this just isn't good stuff to show kids.",1275436800,,1045,4.282828282828283
8039933,5,B00067Z2KU,"I bought this for my 3-year old daughter, and she absolutely loves it! It is a terrific movie, geared towards children, but honestly, I loved it almost as much as she did! My 9-year old son has watched it about a dozen or so times also.

Teaches valuable lessons, a great music score, and a fantastic cast makes me want more of these types of movies!

Can't go wrong with this one, I'd buy it again when this one wears out :)",1102636800,,425,4.170731707317073

Thanks",1062028800,,242,3.84
