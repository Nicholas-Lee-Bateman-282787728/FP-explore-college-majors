8174162,1,B000N2H82S,"Like the fellow said in another review here, the DVD is very simplistic, showing you how to write in a word processor, how to edit addresses in a spreadsheet, and how to use the USPS program to send mailings out.

This is all very rudimentary knowledge most folks already know about so I was very disappointed in this DVD.

Plus the information is already obsolete because the USPS information you need to have your newsletters mailed out is no longer valid as shown on the DVD, so you're out of luck.

You're better off buying a book on newsletters from a well respected professional who has been there, done that.  Otherwise you're not going to learn anything from a 15-20 minute video made on a computer desktop that shows you stuff you already know.

8174163,5,B000N2H82S,"James has done it again, I am a repeat customer of James Brausch and just like all the other products I have purchased from James this is top shelf stuff. I would suggest that if you are interested in producing a printed newsletter this is something that you should be interested in.",1191628800,,283,4.461538461538462
8174164,1,B000N2H82S,"This DVD is produced in a very amateur way, and anyone who has even a basic knowledge of word processing already has the ability to do all he covers. The only piece you may not have is the third part, which tells about  the UPS program to upload, print and mail your newsletter. This single piece of information is certainly not worth the cost of the product.",1188691200,4,359,4.358208955223881
8174165,5,B000N2H82S,"Yes, you can simply watch these movies and work right along with James -- and at the end, have your own newsletter.

James Brausch is known for his no-nonsense, straight-to-the-point video courses, and in this case, he once again delivers a superb product.

There are a couple of assumptions:

1. First, you have to know enough about the subject of your newsletter to be able to publish a newsletter that people will pay for.

2. You have to be able to market and reach your target audience.

This would also be a great product choice for groups (such as non-profits, civic groups, etc.) that want to economically publish and mail a periodic newsletter.

It is definitely worth purchasing.",1171411200,,689,4.796610169491525

(He even shows you whereto get fully featured word processing and ""office"" software absolutely FREE.  This tip alone was worth the price of the DVD!)

If you've ever even considered publishing your own print newsletter (and you should), then this DVD is a must have item.",1171411200,,633,5.048076923076923
