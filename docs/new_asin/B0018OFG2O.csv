8283258,4,B0018OFG2O,"At the time of this writing, this listing is simply labeled ""Higurashi No Naku Koroni Kai."" [Brief interruption! This listing is incorrect, and will hopefully be corrected soon. If you're looking for the second season of Higurashi When They Cry in English or otherwise, hop on down to the third paragraph. If you're looking for a detailed review of the whole second Higurashi animated series, you will not find it here, though I can say it's just as satisfying as the first. If you're looking for a description of this product, read the upcoming paragraph.]

The image presented here (and the assumed product being offered) is of the 10th Limited Edition Japanese release, featuring episodes 19 and 20 of the ""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai"" series. Its correct sub-title is ""Sosaroku - Musubi File. 04,"" and is notable for starting the second half of the final arc in ""ni Kai."" It comes on 2 discs, and the original set came with a Mahjong tile and small trinkets that were meant to link to the other 5 Musubi LE DVD sets. I do believe these were first print bonuses, so if you're purchasing this you may want to contact the seller to get that checked out. Special features include a continuation of the ""Ura-Higu"" mini-series - largely pointless, but possibly amusing in its complete lack of purpose - and an un-aired TV animation trailer. At the roughly $25 listed, this is one of the cheapest listings you will find on the Internet, but considering this goes for just a few bucks in Japan, it's hard to justify that price. While this volume has no English language option, it does have spoken Japanese, which the cast continues to execute to near-perfection. Finally, it should be noted that this product is Region 2 coded, meaning you can't play it on just any old DVD player. All said, this is a relatively satisfying package for the right consumer, but probably not what most people are looking for.

I'll say it once again if you skipped the second paragraph, this volume continues no trace of English! If you are not interested in purchasing the Japanese single volumes, but do want to purchase the full set in Japanese, I'll include a link in the comments section under this review to get you there (as the full set is not to be found on Amazon.com at the present time). If you cannot speak Japanese, but still want to buy an official full set with English subtitles, check that same comment. Finally, it needs to be noted that there is no English dubbed version of this series beyond the first season, and it is a near certainty that there never will be.

I apologize is this comes across as a very dry, information-heavy review. With the seeming misinformation and possibly misleading reviews already posted, as someone who actually does own this volume, I felt the need to set the record straight. I'll post the previously-mentioned comment after this review is published.",1362960000,7,2884,4.718253968253968
8283259,1,B0018OFG2O,"It is region 2, so it is a japanese import with no subtitles.  This series doesn't seem to have been released with subtitles.",1357344000,4,125,4.434782608695652
8283260,1,B0018OFG2O,"I won't even THINK about buying this until someone tells me that they bought this DVD subtitled. I have season 1, and I want season 2, but it doesn't mention any subtitling. If I find out there are subtitles, I'll change my rating from 1 star to 5, and buy it.",1352851200,2,260,4.117647058823529
