5862062,1,B00DXLO086,"Everyone knows what a classic this show is...so on to the DVD product itself...

The video quality of the masters are just okay.  They did not remaster new transfers from film so some analog tape noise is apparent as the seasons go on.  Here's hoping they will give the series the special attention it deserves on Blu-Ray one day.  They also used the wrong theme orchestration and animation for the Main Title of the Black and White seasons.

There are tons of vintage special features that could have been included on the individual seasons if Sony wanted. The Bewitched Collector on youtube has demonstrated this.  Also, how is it Japan and the UK have a bonus disc that the US release could have included?  Sony just wants to make a quick buck with uninformed marketing execs who don't care about the product. CBS does it right more often for special vintage series like this.

It's a shame Sony does not care about one of it's number one vintage TV assets. But I'm pretty sure they believe consumers will buy it anyway, in the bargain bin packaging that scratches the discs.  If you're the average consumer looking for a bargain then I am sure you will appreciate this set, but it will leave many Bewitched fans wishing it was better.

5862063,5,B00DXLO086,"I haven't watched the entire series, but so far the quality has been great! The extras that are in there are extremely well done and interesting; especially since this is such an old show.

The packaging I cannot say enough good about. Basically, the case opens up into two half and there is a spindle in each half. The discs are neatly stacked on each spindle, held in place by a cleverly designed piece of cardboard. Elegant and functional - not a single scratch, scuff or blemish. I wish some other series like M*A*S*H and Hogan's Heroes would stand up and pay attention to this packaging design.",1381881600,18,599,4.598130841121495
5862064,5,B00DXLO086,"After many years of Columbia promising us a ""Complete Series"" set of ""Bewitched"", now comes word the show will be released in its entirety. You get every single ""Bewitched"" episode that aired on the ABC television network and the shows look wonderful as they were cleaned from the master tapes. However, what we don't get as fans are three episodes that were actually shot with one airing on ABC, but pulled out of the syndication package because of the story content. I for one was hoping that when the entire series was released in one DVD set those shows would finally make the light of day, but alas it wasn't to be so.

 Also troubling is the fact that there are no bonus features. What about some old interviews with the shows stars and producers and writers; what about some old ""Bewitched"" commercials?; what about a bit more effort in salvaging those lost shows?

 The packaging also is typical of Sony when they put a ""Complete Series"" on DVD: the DVD's are stacked on top of one another in two bundles, so be careful with them. Also, the first two seasons here are the colorized shows not the black and white ones, although they too can be purchased. Or you can do what I do...draw the color from your TV set and watch the first two years in black and white and save some money!

 Ohhh well, at least fans get a chance to enjoy the best sitcom ever with all its wonderful charm in one complete set.

 P.S...if you already own the individual season sets there is really no reason to purchase this, but if you don't own them this is a must-have!",1379635200,198,1554,4.447183098591549

5862086,2,B00DXLO086,"Bewitched is my Favorite classic TV show.  I not only watched many of the episodes the first time they were aired, while it was still in production, I have watched the reruns as often as possible starting in the 1960s and on up to present day. However, I'm very disappointed with the purchase of the set from Mills Creek, especially at the price charged.  The first thing I found was that the box was mangled when it arrived due to careless packing.  Once I opened it, I found that many of the disks were dirty and badly scratched as if second hand.  Also, the packaging claims that the episodes are the original, broadcast versions.  This is an outright lie.  There are bits, clips and even whole scenes missing from nearly every episode and they are not in correct, sequential order.  The picture is zoomed in or displaced in several of them and at least one or two of the episodes are quite faded with many of the episodes a bit blurry.  As recently as 2015, I saw episodes on Television which included scenes that are missing from these DVDs.  Also, at the price charged, I was expecting extras, such as interviews, documentary information, outtakes, if such still exist, etc.  Obviously, I won't be recommending this set to anyone.  I wish someone with the correct rights would restore the series properly.",1520294400,4,1311,4.656521739130435

5862108,5,B00DXLO086,"This was a great buy. It has about 21 or 22 DVDs in this box. It contains every single episode ever shown. One thing that is very important to understand is that these are the original broadcast uncut versions. Somewhere along the way when some cable and television companies got a hold of the episodes to rebroadcast them, they cut out a lot of the alcohol, drug, and even slightly suggestive sexual scenes. A travesty. Here you have the original broadcast versions with nothing cut out. This show was originally made for adults and was never intended for children. I do not think that there is anything children cannot see or should not see in the original broadcast episodes, just be aware that there are many references to alcohol and drug consumption, specifically prescription pain medication and tranquilizers which were part of the original show. This is how they fought back in the 1960s when I was growing up. Please do not judge it by today's standards. Each disc even has a choice where you can choose: Play All or choose to play a specific episode. So if you choose: Play All, you can just sit back or lay back and one episode will play after another, with no commercials of course. This was one of my favorite shows when I was growing up, and I really wanted to see the original versions that I saw when I was growing up in the 1960s and not the highly edited versions that they are now showing on television.

5862114,4,B00DXLO086,"If you're a heterosexual male of a certain age then theres a very strong likelihood that your personal preferences in women were in part shaped by two TV shows; Bewitched and I Dream of Jeanie.  Bewitched premiered to strong ratings on ABC in 1964 running for eight seasons and starred Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stephens, a witch married to a hapless mortal and the challenges which follow.  Darrin, her spouse is an advertising exec for a New York firm called McMahon & Tate and bears the brunt of trying to have a normal life while his wife and her meddling relatives magical powers wreak havoc on his existence- comedy mayhem ensues in every episode.  The series was so successful the following year NBC decided they needed their own magic blonde so Sidney Sheldon cooked up I Dream of Jeanie about a gorgeous genie in a bottle discovered by an astronaut after landing on a remote island.

  The cast is superb starting with Montgomery; stunningly beautiful and incredibly charismatic you cant take your eyes off of her.  Two actors played her husband Darrin, Dick York and later Dick Sergeant who replaced York in Season 6 as a severe back injury forced York to quit the show.  Agnes Moorehead is marvelous as Samanthas mother Endora who is not thrilled with her daughters choice in spouses and David White as Darrins boss Larry Tate is a dependable straight man for all the antics.  Of the recurring players Paul Lynde stands out as Samanthas snarky warlock Uncle Arthur and can always be counted on for plenty of laughs.

  The show ran for 8 seasons and ratings began to decline in 1970 and frankly the cast looks pretty fatigued with it all at this point.  All said and done Bewitched holds up 45 years later although the plots become quite repetitive after awhile.  Supposedly set in commuter town Westport, CT (a place I know very well) it looks nothing like Westport.  Also, somewhat surprising for the period Samantha and Darrin are shown frequently occupying the same bed which network censors of the day might have been expected to balk at.  Given its the Mad Men era cocktails are constantly being imbibed, Don Draper would have been right at home.  Also, it seemed strange to me that for a family show aimed at kids the final season Ms. Montgomery is clearly braless for virtually every episodebut it was the 70s I guess.  The show ends without fanfare or any closure for its audience and there are no special features of any kind with this box set.  You'll be enchanted by Bewitched even after all these years.",1507248000,,2534,4.718181818181818

5862116,4,B00DXLO086,"I had seriously forgotten how good this series is.  Agnes Morehead is a better actress playing a deeper character than I remembered.  I had forgotten how solid an actor Elizabeth Montgomery was.  The first Gladys Kravitz (Alice Pearce) is as wonderful and funny as I remember.  Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne) is even funnier than I recall, although as an adult seeing her again I feel sorry for the character (getting older and with some dementia).  As a kid I thought her shtick was funny.  Now I realize the character wasn't a clown the laughs were at her expense.

Both positive and negative (depending on your prospective): the series quality has not been retouched.  The quality is the original 1964-19972 TV quality.

My only real criticism of this product is the packaging--it's all paper, and not even thick card stock at that.  When it arrived the outside packaging looked like it had been tossed about and warn.  The disks are in paper sleeves, not the plastic cases I expected.  I have not seen the whole series yet--I hope the disks are not damaged.",1506470400,,1056,4.741758241758242

5862120,4,B00DXLO086,"Keep in mind that opinion plays a strong factor in these ""reviews."" I plan to discuss my impressions and let you decide if the product appeals to you.

First, to package more than 250 episodes of what was a classic in mid-century television is difficult and Sony has found a spectacular solution that not only avoids waste but makes it easy to keep your place in this 8 season box set when each season contained more than 35 episodes. Season one began in 1965 and the series ended with the divorce of Elizabeth Montgomery and William Ascher in 1974. So this box set is the same shape as a single disc DVD. Though the first two seasons were black and white they've been colorized here, though not in the individual season packaging.

""Bewitched"" is not only entertainment but an increasingly important documentation of history. Though I first watched many of these episodes in first run on our 12"" antenna set they, like I, are old. The concept is that of a beautiful and intelligent young witch (the legendary Elizabeth Montgomery) who falls in love with a mortal man (Dick York, then Dick Sargent-more on that later) and must function as an All-American housewife and mother in the age of the Nuclear Family. Her own family, witches and warlocks all, create most of the dramatic tension because (forgive me) you can take the ""girl"" out of culture but you can't take the culture out of the ""girl.""

No, no. Elizabeth Montgomery is not a girl; she's a woman. (In fact, as of 1995 she is a was.) But one can't help watch episode after episode without becoming disgusted by the diminished and subservient role that women played for far too long. Taken out of the 60's and early 70's and you will, I hope, be offended over and over by the sickening sexism that exists in every episode. (Roseanne did a black and white satire of this period called ""That's My Rosy"" which spells it out better than I can in far less time.

But so much must be taken in context of the period in which this show was written l, designed and produced. Every episode uses a formula that involves a handfull of possibilities: a scenario is established in the cold open in which Samantha Stephens is innocently going about her morning when a family member will ""pop"" in causing Darrin to get angry and insult them. A spell is cast, most often by Samantha's mother (The classic Agnes Moorehead) and very often the result of the spell is witnessed by the nosy neighbor, Mrs. Kravitz. (First played by Alice Pearce who succumbed to cancer in March of 1966, then played by Sandra Gould as Abner's sister.) Darin goes into Madison Ave where he tries not to lose the new client because of the spell while Samantha tries to placate the offended mother/cousin/aunt/uncle/father then must justify the insanity to Mrs. Kravitz.

In the 21st century (ok, by the time ""Rhoda"" premiered) we ask ourselves over and over why Sam doesn't turn the tyranical Darrin into a foot stool and live to her full potential as every episode begins with his shouting and ends with a rated G kiss.

Context. In1966 the subjugation of women appeared to be The Way and in fact today there are many who still fight to return to this; raising boys to feel superior and training girls to be good mommies.

It was a number of things that made this show a hit. The magic certainly, but you'll see the wires that levitate and be impressed by the magic created without the use of CGI. The main thing is the high quality of acting. The dhow cast thhe most celebrated Shakespearian actors from stage and screen ranging from 1920 to 1971. Elizabeth plays a vareiety of rolls and flows between them with ease as does Moorehead, Marione Lorne, Paul Lynde and countless others. In regard to television nothing is a substitute for outstanding acting.

Dick York, a skilled actor who was a VERY good sport, suffered from lower back damage that finally caused him to leave the show and be replaced by Dick Sargent. At quick glance they look alike but it becomes evident that York was the superior actor. I already mentioned the cast change of Mrs. Kravitz. Louise Tate was played by two actors but to replace the co-star was a brazen step.

(Again, ""Roseanne"" in the Tag of the episode where Vhalke replaced Gorandon as Becky, the family is watching ""Bewitched.""
ROSE: I can't believe they replaced that Darrin!
JACKIE: Well they were a hit show. They knew they could get away with anything.
BECKY: Well I like the second Darrin better. )

This series takes us through the fastest cultural revolution in American History. We begin with dainty feminine suits and hates and end with hip-huggers, wide belts and Samantha with Laurie Partridge hair. The show NEVER steps into reality.  There is no mention of the cold war, the Vietnam war, the threat of communism, the entire election year of 1968 in which three major political and cultural figures were assassinated, the civil rights movement, the women's rights movement,  The sexual revolution, reproductive rights, no, in fact, this is one sitcom that was able to transcend  The line in television of 1970 when all in the family, Mary Tyler Moore, and mash all premiered. For the witch to have survived it had to have been something special.

 At this price, you simply have to buy their series. If not for the entertainment value in for its place in the cultural history of the United States. And if that is an enough, then absolutely everyone needs to know who Elizabeth Montgomery was. She lives on. Montgomery had a summer home in Patterson, Putnam County, New York. Following her death, the 794-acre estate was sold to New York State and became Wonder Lake State Park. It remains so. Patterson, NY (not to be confused with Paterson, NJ) was the fictional settingof Darrin and Samantha's home.

I give this four stars because 5 exhibits long lasting excellence such as ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Mary Tyler Moore""  and the underlying sexism in this series will, from time to time, make you curse and want to throw the disc out the window.",1504656000,,6012,4.6726584673604545

So now I have to get a CD case or dvd cases to put them in. Because this packaging isn't gonna cut it.

5862165,5,B00DXLO086,"You either love the TV show or you don't so will not say anything about series since it would not matter to anyone that is looking at the collection.

Mine arrived in good condition and like others have pointed out, they are just stacked on two spindles in the box with cardboard to retain them for shipping.  Really deserves better but then I'm sure the collection would cost much more than the asking price.  You sure could put the DVDs in other holders but if you are careful and don't slide them on each other when looking at them they should be fine like they are.

I understand that the later 2015 release set of 22 DVDs by Mill Creek does come with a better storage box that does not stack them.

Now...  are there any of the 33 that didn't get recorded properly?  Really can't say as it will take quite some time to view them all without total binge watching 24/7  I sure hope they are all okay as I'm not even half way through yet and of course my return time has passed.

Also happy I purchased this box set before the price shot way up to where it is right now,  About four times as much now.

Have to say though, I would watch Elizabeth Montgomery in this series even with the sound turned off 8-)  Love that woman and love her characters she plays.  Beautiful , funny , smart and with a kind heart in real life, how can you not enjoy her.",1488240000,,1351,4.189922480620155

5862176,3,B00DXLO086,"Mill Creek set.  My rating is for the set, not the show.  Since everyone already knows what the show is.  I have only bought two Mill Creek Sets.  Bewitched, and Sliders.  Both sets have problems.  A couple of disks froze and skipped.  But I can live with it I suppose.  Not worth the trouble sending it back.  I probably won't buy another Mill Creek set.  Can't say anything about the tv show that hasn't already been said.  I can only put in my 2 cents.  I liked the first Darrin better.  By the time it got to the second Darrin, so many shows were just re-worked from other episodes.  Endora does something to Darrin.  Samantha yells into the air  ""MOTHER you take that spell off of Darrin.  Then Darrin gets the account.  Ok now wait......don't panic......  this is still one of my favorite  shows........  And I've read a bunch of times that people say all the witches names ended with an ""a"".........  But Mary played by Madge Blake (The Witches Are Out)  doesn't end with an ""a""  so I'm not sure
what that's all about.  So I suppose I've gone way over my 2 cents worth.  Just wanted to share my Mill Creek Problems in case anyone wants to know.  I was expecting the colorized version of first seasons,  but they were black and white.  Which is fine,  just wasn't expecting that.......  Too many releases and all the reviews are mixed together.  There should be a separate review for each release ...  me thinks.",1486166400,,1418,4.456692913385827

5862181,3,B00DXLO086,"This review is for the Mill Creek DVD set, NOT the Sony DVDs. (I say this because Amazon groups together reviews from all versions.)

The Mill Creek version is perfect for the casual viewer who wants inexpensive access to this fun series. Collectors will absolutely want to stay away from this set!

Mill Creek has a poor reputation for quality, and they don't do anything here to improve on that reputation. The image compression fluctuates throughout each episode due to the fact that they cram twelve (or more) episodes on each disc. If you just want to experience the series, this set will be fine, but if you are a fan and collector, it will greatly disappoint you.

The packaging continues this trend. It's a sort of slip case made from cardstock, with several loose cardstock sleeves holding 2 DVDs each. Every time I pick it up, The top tries to slide off, threatening to spill the entire set onto the floor. The box is easily creased and crushed.

Also, it's worth noting that I researched the colorized edition, but when I viewed the used copies, I was unaware that Amazon had sent me to sellers of the set containing a mix of color and black & white episodes. This is because Amazon combines similar items in a confusing and convoluted way. (I decided to keep the mixed set, and buy the colorized seasons separately because it was MUCH cheaper.)",1485043200,,1356,4.6375

My mother is deaf so she has to read the closed caption when she watches tv. Bewitched is one of her favorite shows as a kid and this series offers closed caption in other languages such as spanish, etc. but no english. that was very disappointing.

The show it self fairs better. I have only had time to watch most of season one but so far so good. Season one is never the best for most shows but I have seen episodes from other seasons on TV over the years so I'm sure it will get seven better.

Maybe one day they will release this on Blu-Ray, clean up the audio and video and put it a proper package. As for now this is all we got and it does a passable job.",1462406400,,753,4.013333333333334

The picture is as good as one could expect and I even tried turning the color all the way down on my TV to restore the original black and white.  It is probably a bit too much trouble for every episode and the colorized version is no worse than many of the early color TV shows.
I was fully aware of the very user unfriendly packaging from other reviews, so I purchased a package of paper CD/DVD sleeves and transferred all of the 33 discs into them. I even cut down an empty Triscuits cracker box to about 4 inches and they fit perfectly in that.  The sleeves have a window to show the season and episode numbers. I will put them all back in the original packaging when I have watched all the discs. I do not know how the manufacturers thought the original packaging would work for the casual user who would probably just watch a couple of episodes at a time.  Once one was below the top disc you would have to take out all of the discs above it to put them back in the stack.
So, with a little work on your own packaging this can be many hours of fun.",1453766400,6,1102,4.111627906976744

So far, no problem with the disks themselves. I also didn't know that there was a short scene before the opening credits on the show, so that was a nice surprise.

That being said, I just received my Bewitched complete series on DVD and I look forward to watching all of the shows in order. There are reviews out there that were complaining about the packaging. Those reviews are not from this box set. As you will see in my included photos, inside the box are eleven two sided disc holders. So there are no discs stacked on top of other discs. I'm pleased with this packaging style. No spindles or hinges to break. There were also reviews saying the first two seasons have been colorized. Again... not this set. One of my attached photos shows the back of the case clearly stating the first two seasons are indeed black and white. I personally am very happy about that because I have never been a big fan of colorized movies or television shows. I have even added a short video clip to this review showing a B&W episode.

It's difficult to dig out one in the middle if you  happen to want to watch an episode in the middle somewhere. Even if you watch them in order, what do you do with the ones that you've watched already?  I started to put them upside down on the other side as I've watched them, but what happens when the other side fills up?  I realize with that many disks, there probably wasn't a better way to do it.

The real issue, though, is that there are no English subtitles.  If I record these reruns on my Tivo, I get subtitles, so I know they made them.  But they didn't include them on these DVDs.  BUMMER!",1451433600,2,754,4.054054054054054

5862373,1,B00DXLO086,"On the surface, Bewitched is a lighthearted comedy about a witch who marries a mortal.  Unfortunately, the underlying purpose of Bewitched is nothing to laugh or smile about.  But in order to understand what Bewitched is really about, it is important to understand that criminals have been using television to take control of  your mind since you were a baby.  If you grew up watching t.v. in America, then you have been raised (in part) by criminals.

Emasculating men in America is one of the long term goals of the criminals who run Hollywood.  Bewitched has been very helpful in the area of emasculating men in America.  But the producers and writers were very clever in disguising their goal.  For example, Samantha is a housewife, while Darrin is a successful bread winner.  This cleverly creates the illusion that Bewitched supports traditional family structures.
But the indisputable fact is that Samantha is the one who wears the pants in the relationship.  Samantha has the power, while Darrin is portrayed as a spineless buffoon who is at the mercy of his nose wiggling wife.
By emasculating men in America, the criminals who run the media, our government, and our banking system, hope to eliminate any potential opposition to their crime ring.  And it looks like they have succeeded.

Overall, the series is pretty good, maybe toward the last two seasons the writing was subpar, but still that is understandable for most long running TV comedies of that period.
The packaging of the DVD is the economical stacked spindle type. I have to say comparing another DVD release from about the same time period (I Dream of Jeannie) video quality-wise with the Bewitched Series- I Dream of Jeannie is lot clearer. The reason could be the source video was better for I Dream of Jeannie. Edit: I have to comment that after the colorized Seasons 1 and 2 the video taped show with visible interlacing (crt scanlines) was used for the rest of the seasons. The interlacing does effect the sharpness and clarity of the picture, which can be beneficial- in the case where wires used during magic scenes would be less visible otherwise.",1443225600,,1002,4.597765363128492

The price was affordable so I just went ahead and hoped it would be packaging and not quality that I was giving up. Happily I was right about that. You can purchase a DVD case which you can put the DVD's in to keep from scratching them. That is what I do. I have the box on the shelf where it stays nice. I would have been thrilled to have extras like the old commercials or goofs from the set included. The movie would have been a truly sweet bonus. However they weren't included and honestly I am still extremely happy with my purchase. I was like a child when the package arrived! I bought a bunch of snacks, frozen food I could pop in the microwave, and soda then I overdosed on watching the series. Haha. It was wonderful! The series is in color from the start which confused us at first. We remember it in black and white. However the coloring was done so well it did not negatively impact our enjoyment at all.

5862422,4,B00DXLO086,"Darrin Stephens (Dick York) gets a big wedding night surprise when he learns that his beautiful wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) is a beautiful witch who makes magic happen with a twitch of her nose. Darrin wants to live a ""normal mortal"" life without witchcraft. Samantha promises to do her best to stop using magic. This is the enchanting premise of ""Bewitched"", one of the most enduring TV Sitcoms from the 1960's. ""Bewitched"" remains a success because the magic never became too cute or more precious than the characters, who were vivid and had personality. ""Bewitched"" is a romantic comedy with heart and magic.
  The series revolves around the sparkle of  star Elizabeth Montgomery, who was married to William Asher, the show's principal director and producer. As Samantha innocently bewitched Darrin without magic by being herself, Elizabeth Montgomery has bewitched generations of TV viewers as Samantha. Montgomery plays Samantha as a beautiful, intelligent, caring and level-headed woman who happens to be a witch. She is surrounded by an excellent ensemble cast, including Dick York as her bothered and bewildered mortal mate Darrin, and Agnes Moorehead and Maurice Evans as her very  grand-dame witch and warlock parents Endora and Maurice, who can't understand how or why she would give up her magical heritage for a mixed marriage with a mere mortal. Darrin is rather rude to Endora at their first meeting, dismissing witchcraft as ""nonsense"". Endora, consequently, is constantly putting spells on Darrin, brought on, mostly, by his own mortal arrogance and ego.
 Meanwhile, Darrin must keep Samantha's magic a secret from his boss Larry Tate (David White), his wife Louise (originally Irene Vernon, replaced by the more vivacious Kasey Rogers in Season 3), his parents and assorted other mortals. Next door neighbor Gladys Kravitz (Alice Pearce) knows their is something special and supernatural about Samantha, although she can never convince her long-suffering husband Abner (George Tobias) that anything ""funny"" is going on. Alice Pearce was superb and won an Emmy Award as hysterical Gladys. Sadly, she died of cancer during Season 2. Sandra Gould took over the role in Season 3 and, in sharp contrast to Pearce, gave a much more bitchy and abrasive interpretation.
  The ""Bewitched"" creative team was smart enough to know who and what worked well. Paul Lynde, Bernard Fox and Alice Ghostley all made early appearances as mortal characters before joining the ensemble cast as members of the witch world. Paul Lynde was practical joker Uncle Arthur and Bernard Fox was ""witch"" Dr. Bombay. But, of all of Samantha's extended witch family, nobody was more beloved than Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara, the daffy, darling witch who always made innocent magical mistakes. Lorne won an Emmy Award, and her death near the end of Season 4 was a devastating loss to the series.
  During Season 1, the crew ""shot around"" Elizabeth Montgomery's pregnancy. Her two subsequent pregnancies were cleverly incorporated into the series, as Samantha and Darrin became parents to little witch Tabitha (Erin and Diane Murphy) and, later, warlock Adam (Greg and David Lawrence). Several episodes  revolve around the havoc created by Toddler Tabitha trying to control her ""Wishcraft"", the beginning stages of witchcraft. By this time, a second series character was created for the versatile Montgomery.  Cousin Serena was the exact opposite of Samantha, and often ""double trouble"". Samantha was warm and stable, but Serena was wild and wacky. Eventual screen credit for Serena was given to ""Pandora Spocks"", a playful idea by Montgomery.
  The most serious behind the scenes shake up involved Dick York, who suffered for years from a crippling back injury. The physical pain resulted in an addiction to pills. York's injury, pain and addiction caused him to miss 14 episodes, and many more production delays. In December, 1968, (during Season 5) York collapsed on set and left in an ambulance. He was fired by ABC Network. ""Bewitched"" continued for three more years, with Dick Sargent as Darrin. The switch of actors playing Darrin continues to be a source of largely pointless and nonsensical debate among ""fans.""
  Wheras Dick York played Darrin almost constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown over witchcraft, Sargent played with a calmer, more sarcastic, edge. Sargent also had a decidedly different chemistry opposite Montgomery. Alice Ghostly also joined the cast at this time as Esmeralda, a rather shy and nervous witch designed to fill the ""magical mix-up"" void left by the death of Marion Lorne. In these later seasons, Samantha and Darrin take trips to Salem, Massachusetts for a Witches Convention, and to Europe for a sort of ""business vacation.""
  The series remained imaginative, but the magic faded; just as the magic faded from the marriage of Montgomery and Asher. Separating from Asher in 1972, Elizabeth Montgomery sensibly decided to end ""Bewitched"" as well. She distanced herself from Samantha by appearing in several dramatic and dire TV Movies;  like her Emmy nominated performances in ""A Case Of Rape"" (1974) and ""The Legend Of Lizzie Borden"" (1975), until her untimely death in 1995. Nothing, however, will ever break the timeless spell of ""Bewitched.""",1436313600,2,5280,5.221040189125295

I am not a person who normally cares about packaging but the minimum I expect is for my purchases to be protected.  I have already had discs fall out 3 times and hit the floor.  You have to be extremely careful how you handle the box.  I am planning on moving mine to a DVD book for long term storage.

I ordered the complete Get Smart series with this and the packaging/care/special features are completely different.  Get Smart is whimsically packaged, fully protected, and over 8 hours of bonus features.  How sad Bewitched is in comparison.  So far I have only noticed one special feature.

They should develop new packaging, create a special features disc, and send it to anyone who purchased this for free.  It really is that bad.

But the best part of the series was watching the beautiful Elizabeth Montgomery playing Samantha. I loved the characters in the series. Aunt Clara, Endora, Maurice, Uncle Arthur (played by the talented Paul Lynde), Dr. Bombay, Larry Tate, Gladys Kravitz, etc. The show was always a joy to watch. I know there is a debate on which actor played Darrin the best. My vote has always been the actor Dick York. His facial expressions were priceless when reacting to the withcraft. The actor Dick Sargent wasn't very animated with his facial expressions. He had maybe two distinct expressions, one of mad and the other a strange close mouth grin. This series was basically a fun show to watch and if you like classic cars like I do you'll love seeing them in that time period. Chevrolet sponsored Bewitched and Pontiac sponsored I Dream of Jeannie, another fun series from that time period. I highly recommend this series.",1427155200,,997,4.76878612716763

Basically there are two really deep disk holders with half the disks piled on each one, so you have to pull off every disk before the one you want to reach and set them somewhere until you can fish out the desired disk. Definitely will move into a movie binder later on.

Would have preferred black and white, but you get used to the colorized version. It's funny though because you can see when they switch from colorized to natural color.

Some episodes did have a little trouble loading, and out of nowhere some disks had advertisements in the beginning, but I can deal with it for the price as all of them do work.",1423785600,2,674,4.384

One: I really like having all the episodes but beware: the first two seasons are colorized instead of the original Black & White. If you want to see the original B&W episodes you are out of luck. For many viewers this will not matter, but I think it is cheap and nasty. Two: the packaging is atrocious. What you get are two big piles of disks without individual sleeves or compartments. Forget about keeping the disks in any order or keeping them scratch free or even finding a particular disk easily. This is truly cheap and nasty because it is only to save money for the publisher. Bad business. I don't know which is worse, putting the disks in big piles like this or putting them in slim individual cardboard sleeves which are almost impossible to get the disks in or out of (like some of the Simpsons series). Also, I don't see any Bonus Features :(",1422230400,2,935,4.348571428571429

5862572,5,B00DXLO086,"All 8 seasons, on 33 DVDs. The first two seasons are colorized, which (to me) is great, I hate when a series goes from B&W to color (like Gilligan's Island). I much prefer to watch things in color if possible. The packaging is bare bones, just two spindles, each holding half the discs, much like if you buy blank CDs for burning. On the plus side, it has a much smaller footprint than similarly sized DVD box sets (like MASH). There is no obligatory booklet which kind of surprised me, but it's not a deal breaker.

Picture and sound quality are uniformly excellent, and I like that each disc has a ""play all"" link so you don't have to keep pushing play after each episode.

And LOL, I love that Dick Sargent replaced Dick York as ""Darren,"" but no mention was ever made on the show, it's as if Samantha was the only person in the world who didn't notice.",1420588800,,855,4.3375

This show aired in Turkey back in the 70s and it was called ""The Sweet Witch"" LOL..  Now, seeing it for the first time since 1978, I think the Turkish title does a justice to the character of Samantha who was probably the sweetest witch whoever was. There are many negative reviews about the box design. I do agree that the box set is not designed very well, and yes the DVDs are stacked on top of each other which is not ideal however given the price of $28, I think this is still a great catch. I am not a purist so I didn't mind all of the episoded being in color (yes, all of the first season episoded are in color). I didn't mind them being in color. The picture quality of the first episode is very poor, there are a lot of blemishes and a vertical artifact in front of the screen in most of the episode but do not dismay, the picture quality gets much better in the rest of the shows. Unfortunately, there are no English subtitles which is another downside of this product  (the odd thing is that they pretty much have subtitles for every other language except English).

I purchased this boxset from another seller, and am so glad to own this show. Seasons 1-3 are my personal favorites. Especially the first two seasons with the original Gladys Kravitz (Alice Pearce). Unfortunately, she died in the middle of the second season. She lost a long, hard fought battle with ovarian cancer, and was later replaced. Anyways, as for the boxset, I think it is beautiful! Yes, it is cheap packaging, but if handled with care, it will last a long time! There is an Episode List on the back paper of the boxset on the opposite side. You will need to remove the paper from the boxset! Elizabeth Montgomery & Dick York had such wonderful chemistry together. The seasons with Dick Sargent (6-8) were nowhere as good as the seasons with Dick York (1-5). However, the last seasons are worth watching, because of the wonderful Elizabeth Montgomery. I also love the Aunt Clara episodes!! I wanted to cry when I learned she had died before the show ended!! Sony did such a good job colorizing Season 1 & 2, and you can see so much more!!

Season eight particularly is just embarrassingly awful. Nevertheless, Bewitched in its heyday was both entertaining and thought-provoking.",1418428800,10,444,5.544117647058823

Lift up that page.  THERE IS YOUR EPISODE LIST, DISC BY DISC EPISODE BY EPISODE!  Am I the only one who noticed this?????  My copy of this set came with a list, I suspect others did too, people just don't want to look very hard for it, they would rather whine about it.  Sure, the packaging isn't the greatest, but my set did not have ANY of the issues others claim here.  All 33 discs were there, in order, not a scratch to be seen.

My only gripe with this release is the first two seasons were colorized.  They were filmed in black and white and should have been released as such.  Will be purchasing the first two seasons to get the B&W versions as the individual seasons were released as they originally were.",1417824000,,888,4.459627329192546

5862616,4,B00DXLO086,"Firstly, I prefer the spindle packaging. I read the DVDs in sequence once, dump the contents to hard drive, reference them via a database, and have them literally at my fingertips any time I like. Yes, it is fiddly, but I only have to read them once, and the fact the entire case is quite compact means better shipping too.
As far as the programming goes, this must have something to do with age, because I *loved* this show as a child, but now that I'm a responsible adult (or at least pretend to be) it's frustrating. One, I want to know why Darrin puts up with the mother in law from hell, and two, why does Samantha continually defend her clearly meddling, invasive, vindictive mother?
 I mean, if this were real life, any ""Darrin"" would have dumped both of them years ago. And Samantha? Really? I know women who have moved countries to get away from their mothers who are angels compared to Endora.
I'm still about half way through the series, and waiting for when Dick Sargent replaced the Darrin the last two seasons or so. There was apparently a huge upset over that - I want to see if the kerfuffle was as major as everyone made it out to be.",1416268800,,1151,4.378504672897196

And Elizabeth Montgomery was the best and no one could of topped her for that part. In our day she was considered a ""stone fox"". Dick York who played the first Darrin was the best and was sad when he left the show and was replaced by Dick Sargent. Sargent was OK but York was a much better Darrin. It was a sad day when Elizabeth Montgomery passed away at the age of only 62. Dick York followed and Dick Sargent is passed too. Larry who played Darrins boss has passed as well as Endora who played Samantha's mother. Why can't they make sitcoms as good as these were now? Most sitcoms today just plain suck. Ah! The 60's what a great time to be alive. Yea you may say I am stuck in the 60's. But I like to think of myself as a 60's guy who's stuck in the 21st century.

If you want the black and white versions of the first couple seasons, Amazon has them very cheap here. This is a very classic show that withstands the test of time and remains to be very entertaining today. Even better, you don't really have to worry about your children watching this as it doesn't have the crude humor some newer sitcoms have such as 2 broke Girls and Mom. (Not that I'm bashing those shows, they can be funny sometimes, just not really for the kids.) The packaging itself is annoying for some people as the discs are all stacked into two separate spindles in the box, but you get what you pay for. This is an excellent set for the money, though if I was paying about a hundred dollars for it then there would be a problem. However, at the price, I was more than happy to download artwork for the separate seasons and make my own cases for it. This is a very good show deserving all five of it's stars, but if you are looking for the original black and white episodes for the first few seasons, don't forget to order those with this.",1407196800,2,1143,4.32093023255814
5862704,5,B00DXLO086,Bewitched the complete series is great the picture and sound quality was great for a TV show from the late 60s and watching episodes uncut you catch thongs that were edited for commercials,1407110400,,188,4.7272727272727275
5862705,5,B00DXLO086,This was one of my favorite shows to catch on Nick at Night growing up. Now that they are playing The Nanny and Friends and other shows that were on when I was growing up I don't get to see the old classics anymore. I watched this set for a couple of months and the price went down to a point that I couldn't resist it anymore!

5862706,5,B00DXLO086,"Some reviewers have complained that this was a boring series. I would like to respectively disagree.

What the modern viewer has to remember is what television was like back when this series first came out. Don't try to judge the show according to what TV shows are like today.

I fondly remember waiting each week for the new episodes to come out, and I loved watching the repeat episodes each summer. Back then, they ran 26 weeks of new episodes, then 26 weeks of repeats. I get tired of the modern idea of bouncing back and forth between new episodes and repeat episodes even in the fall.

For its time, the special effects were fun, the situations surprising, and we learned to look forward to our favorite guest stars. I particularly looked forward to some of the crazy aunts and uncles, especially Paul Lynde; I knew I'd enjoy the extra humor their presence would contribute to the show (and to my memories).

The very fact that the series lasted for eight years is a commentary on how much it was loved. Today, though, I can imagine that a person could try to watch all eight seasons in just a matter of weeks, then claim that it was boring. If I had watched every episode that quickly back when I was a kid, perhaps I would have agreed, I don't know. But today, I watch with the memories of the child inside me, so the repetitiveness that some complain about today is not a problem for me.

Maybe the repetitiveness that some people claim to see in this series didn't bother us back when these episodes first aired because there was so much time between episodes. And we loved some of the repetition. We always knew that Paul Lynde (Uncle Arthur) was going to play his practical jokes. We knew that Agnes Moorehead (Endora) was going to put Darren through various kinds of hell, but we loved each situation as they came up. Maybe, when snippets of plot that got reinvented and re-used, they didn't bother us too much back then specifically because it was years between such repetition, rather than weeks as it is for the modern viewer.

I'm not going to cut down the review for the bad packaging, though I wish, as do other reviewers, that they would use an improved packaging that would make it easier to get to the discs that we want to get to.",1406937600,,2254,4.485365853658537

5862708,5,B00DXLO086,"It doesn't have English subtitles but though the 1st 2 seasons were b&w when shot they have been colorized and not badly done either. Plus they appear to have a multi part documentary on the disks where they talk to people like Sol Saks (he wrote for the show starting with the pilot) and William Asher (the producer and Elizabeth Montgomery's husband) which I think is a nice bonus. They come in a box with two molded plastic spindles which isn't the highest tech for storage but it would be hard to make a more complex storage box that didn't cost more than the series itself does I imagine. The copies are good clean, sharp transfers too from what I've seen so far and it's hard to believe they are as old as they are (the 1st episode aired in 1964 so the series is 50 yrs old). At first I thought it didn't have any booklet or sheet listing what was on what disk but I found that it was lightly glued down with some of the sticky stuff they use on such so that it stuck to the back of the slip case. Each season has 4 disks (aside from season 2 which has 5) and around 9 episodes per season.",1406851200,3,1095,4.145539906103286

I read reviews about how they are stacked in the package and had cd storage cases already and just moved them to the new cases as soon as this order came.  This came very fast.  I'm still waiting for 1 item on my order and have enjoyed this for several days already.  My series came with a list of all the shows so I can look for a certain show if I'd like.  It's much nicer watching bewitched without commercials. For the price I don't mind having to use my own storage cases.  Only thing I would prefer is to have cc in english for the hearing impaired, but again I read the information about this order ahead of time and was aware there was no cc, Bewitched is on tv and there is no cc there either so these DVD's are wonderful.

Initially I was going to rate this set 3 stars, but as another reviewer commented, there were 2 additional DVDs that Sony included in the UK set that they didn't include in the USA version. The UK set has the movie ""Bewitched"" on one DVD and an ""Extras"" DVD that contains goofs and featurettes on some of the regular guest stars on the series (i.e.--Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, etc.). I don't quite understand why Sony doesn't make their sets the same for all countries. In spite of the poor packaging, it is a way to obtain the entire series without the expense of buying the individual seasons. I just wish Sony would have included those two DVDs that are found on the UK set.",1406246400,13,907,4.496969696969697

Anyway, I'm giving this set 5 stars only because it's such a great show, funny and entertaining with many real life issues addressed even in today's standards. The only one overlooked, even a bit glorified is alcoholism. I mean, Larry (Darrin's boss) is a raving alcoholic. Plus, there are so many wonderful guest stars making this a show deserving of true classic status. If you love Bewitched, you will love to have this set along with all the extras about the series.

I have to say, the packaging is pretty bad. This, alone, may actually lower the rating of this wonderful set. It's not that I really hate that the DVDs are stacked, it's that they are a bit difficult to even take off/out of the ridiculous enclosed spindle.

But, the colorization is good, and matches well with season 3, so, it does not look out of place, except the standard odd looking teeth and eys on occasion.  The disks are labled oddly, with the disk count going through the whole series, and not starting over with each season. Also, only the first 2 season disks show which episodes are present on the disk.  Lastly, the packaging is just 2 vacuform stems, so, unless you are going to bingle-view the whole show, you are going to have to put a sack of previously watched disks somewhere.

If you want a particular one, you have to pull all the ones you don't want out until you get to it.

5862757,4,B00DXLO086,"A very good fantasy series. Really good for taking me away from reality when I need it. A show about a guy who marries a woman with godlike abilities, yet she only uses them to do good. It's a tough life for Darrin Stevens, because being married to a witch is no easy business, as he's always under constant scrutiny by Samantha's friends and relatives, but he wouldn't have it any other way and does not like to take advantage of his wife's godlike abilities, even though at times he can't always control the fact that he does! Sure, he and Sam have their differences at times, but they always kiss and make up and live happily till the next episode in the end.

And who wouldn't be happy living in that nice fantasy world in a nice pretty house with a spacious backyard that even has a gazebo in it?! And the Stevenses, despite being a middle class family, have plenty of running space inside their home and have an upstairs and a bench by the stairway and another bench in front of a window they never use and even a den! And everyone they meet has the same type of last name and their only neighbors are the Kravitzes....

Perhaps, the only fault I may find with this show is its constant use of cheap plot devices at times, such as pulling historical figures out of the past into the present and pulling characters out of story books, but even ignoring those faults, this show is still filled with hours of fun fantasy inspiration!",1398297600,2,1436,4.394736842105263

The first two seasons of Bewitched were in black and white originally. In this disc set, there is a colorized version of these two seasons. Elizabeth Montgomery played Samantha, a witch married to a mortal trying her best to live like a mortal. Of course, things never go the way they are supposed to...magic happens...accidentally with hilarious results. Agnes Moorehead, played Samantha's colorful, meddling mother(also a witch) and Darrin's worst nightmare. No love lost between them. Dick York played the original Darrin and was later replaced by Dick Sargent. There are many wonderful guest stars along with Paul Lynde, who plays 'Uncle Arthur', absentminded  'Aunt Clara', 'Doctor Bombay' (played by Bernard Fox, and Samantha's wild cousin, Serena (played by Elizabeth Montgomery) who just happens to be Samantha's look a like.

Another surprise I found was that the first season was colorized.  I must have missed that while reading others reviews.  I am not a B&W purist when it come to TV shows.  I've always wanted to see the first season in color because of the 1st Gladys Kravitz. Alice Pearce is my favorite Gladys by far and this Bewitched Series DVD has granted my wish I've had since I was 10 in 70.

The packaging as describes by many other reviewers was acceptable.  I had an old cd case with 40 slots and it's the only way to store the dvd's.

Buy instead other releases of the series or on Antenna TV to see the series as it is the correct way to enjoy the series. Also look for digital downloads, that might be available.

One thing I never remembered... there were so many ginger haired (red headed) men in the show. I also noticed the baby had changed from red hair, to dark hair, as she was a newborn, in the 2nd season. I also noticed the inside house does not match the ""facade"" pictures during transitions. Where the den and the kitchen door meets in that hallway, we should not see a door with light coming through it. That is where the garage should be, so no light would come through it.

The book style packaging has all eight seasons in two spindles, one disc on top of the other which is cumbersome.  Regardless, it was a wonderful show & I've enjoyed watching it again. The original Gladys Kravitz, portrayed by Alice Pearce, was my favorite & I wondered why she was replaced.

The packaging is not the best way to store DVD's, but I think its still better than the cardboard slots you see in some sets where you have no choice but to drag the disc across an edge to take it out.

For anyone wanting to know, all seasons in this set are in color.  If you want the B & W editions, why not pickup this set, if you don't have the series, and then just buy the B & W seasons separately.  That's what I did.

But I'm impressed with the technology used in colorizing this show; complicated patterns in clothing, natural skin tones, subtle shadings.  Nothing like the earlier tech that, well, looked colorized.

5862811,2,B00DXLO086,"The overall quality of the actual show is very good the basis for this review is because of the packaging, extras, subtitles and issue with subtitles.

First negative in this reviewer's opinion is the packaging - basically you get a box with 2 spindles each holding 1/2 of the total number of disks -- the only thing holding the disks on each of the spindles is a cheap piece of cardboard - think cutting out a piece of cardboard from a box at the grocery store and you get the idea.

Second negative is that there are no subtitles for the hearing impaired - the only subtitles available on this set are Spanish and Portuguese.  Whether is a glitch with this reviewer's particular set or a problem with the set in general unless you immediately hit ""play all"" on the menu the Spanish subtitles are the default not ""no subtitles.

Third negative is that unless the menu is used within approx. 30 seconds of it displaying on the monitor the disk set will automatically play the first episode only on the disk.

This set does have colorized versions of the first and second season so if you are a purist that wants the black and white versions of these seasons this isn't the set for you.

This set is the Region 1 US release - there are also listing for the Region 2 UK release on this site -- both have the same cover art which is unusual so verify that you are ordering the correct region for your player.",1383177600,157,1405,4.384615384615385
5862812,4,B00DXLO086,"When interracial marriages was still making suburbia very upset--and was actually illegal in some parts of the nation- Hollywood figured out how to help soothe over the inevitable anxiety: Repackage it only as an attractive and smart blonde marrying an ad executive. And show that both sides of the family ultimately have some adjusting to do!

The resulting scripts' ultimately stirred up a sure-fire 'potion' of comedy laughs for the ABC network. It also made Elizabeth Montgomery and her co-stars a success.

Samantha objects to the ad portrayals of witches as ugly and deformed by McMann and Tate, Darrin's advertising company, in Season One of this series (""The Witches Are Out""). This advertising account pays the Stephens's bills for a nice home. They're able to live the American Dream which is still very important post-war. But the ad campaign stereotypes 'her people' and their culture. Samantha wants Darrin to think about what he is doing. Darrin is caught between the preferences of his client and requests of his relatives. What does he ultimately have to do??

Because the Stephens are 'different' from most families. they have to use a 'witch doctor'. Dr. Hubert Bombay is summoned only by voice command from one of the Stephens (first showing up in Season Three ""There's Gold In Them Thar Pills""). He adores Samantha, but cannot figure out where Darrin successfully fits in. Darrin is 'strange' to the witches!!

Even less professional is Endora, deliciously played by Agnes Morehead. She is the 'evil mother in law'. Never ever bothering to remember his correct name. Endora just calls poor Darrin by whatever pops into her head at the moment. Unlike Samantha, she occasionally attempts to use her powers for 'evil'--even initially trying to break up the romance. Having a mortal son-in-law is embarassing!!

It is alluded to that she and Samantha's father Maurice (Maurice Evans) are either separated or have an open marriage by non-consent--itself shocking  in this `liberated era'. Endora is more openly the anti-housewife, she wants to travel the world and through time instead of cleanning the house and doing laundry. It shocks Endora that Samantha insead settles for 'this'! 'Samantha darling' could have so much more.

Instead of `hating' Endora though--audiences are supposed to empathize with and feel pity. Rather than fully enjoying her independence, Endora obviously spends time picking apart what she cannot ever have. Being all powerful does not mean anything when you cannot control true love. Love is stronger than magic.

Because she does want her daughter to be happy, Endora actually refrains from hurting Darrin, it is just good-natured teasing after all. She lets the two of them stay together. She might be envious of the happy marriage which the two of them have. This does become apparent when Endora uses magic to 'help' Darrin (""What Makes ""Darrin Run?""). She wouldn't have even lifted a finger if she did not actually feel something for his well-being.

And like all grandmothers, Endora IS happy about having Tabitha--and then Adam. Because Endora wanted grandchildren to play with, she did not personally care that they are part-mortal. Darrin himself earlier mused about life with half-magical children in ""...And Something Makes Three"".  Being a parent would pose challenges, but moreso, when they came from two 'different' cultures. The Stephens would have to explain both mortal and witch culture to their children. Helping them learn to use powers and interact with people (from all backgrounds) are tackled in episodes.

All of the comings and goings at 1164 Morning Glory Circle generate suspicion among the neighbors. Instead of neighborhood security or respect, Gladys Kravitz (Alice Pearce and Sandra Gould) got portrayed as a lonely old loon. Nobody else believes--or even likes what she is saying. A running gag throughout the series is her getting worked up by what 'other people' are doing.

Apparently Abner Kravitz (George Tobias) doez has a crush on Samantha! He writes his own wife off as a hysterical busybody--especially when Gould later took over the role in 1966. This Mrs. Kravitz began calling the neighborhood police on Samantha and her relatives! Not the best way to go about making neighborhood friends.

Mrs. Kravitz and Endora are both not powerful in their marriage. They have to preoccupy themselves with 'getting others' specifically because they are not content with their unions. This too is radical, challenging the notion that every marriage leads to perfect happiness. The series is different from earlier sitcoms, where every woman was content in the marriage--and did not desire anything else. Marriage can be dull for the people who want and need 'more' in their lives.

The only relatives who openly like Darrin just for himself are 'Uncle Arthur' (Paul Lynde) and 'Aunt Clara' (Marion Lorne). They are the only members of Samantha's family who do not make fun of mortals. Darrin feels comfortable talking with them when they come to the house.

This series ran between 1964-1972, so the special effects are obviously not up to today's computer-generated expectations. The plots still hold up very well. And they held up very well in their time especially considering what was on the other networks (ahem, Batman).  Or considering that Darrin suddenly looks 'different' midway through the series (Dick York left because of disability). Other lesser-quality series would have been damaged by these 'chips'. Bewitched was crafted very well from the start.

All of the seasons are included, and for this release, all of the episodes are going to be in color. The first two seasons, if you either saw them originally or through reruns, were actually filmed and originally shown in black and white. Presenting them in color for the DVD release has caused a degree of dispute among us series fans if the release itself is 'authentic'. But I am convinced that the coloration is not taking anything away. Some things (like Endora's oulfit) can only be viewed accurately in full color because it's so trippy. This is one of the series which color TV was really designed for.

 The only flaw of this release is that there are no extras--like interviews or bloopers. Okay the fact that they were dealing with the analogy of 'interracial marriage' might not have lent itself to a lot of bloopers on the set. But maybe some interviews would have been nice.",1382572800,3,6433,5.103710751665081

There is no big deal with buying this complete series. Okay So the season are not packed in to each season of the show... but I can't see why other people can't go to a store and pick up a cd/dvd storage case and then fill the storage case up with each season in the right order & then leave the package as it came in for the great artwork. I love this classic tv show.
