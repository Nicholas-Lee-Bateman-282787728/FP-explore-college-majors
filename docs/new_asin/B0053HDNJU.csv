8455232,5,B0053HDNJU,"This system really explains the mechanics of playing the guitar, regardless of style of music you want to play.  The instructor goes into enough detail that I finally understood things that had me scratching my head in the past.  There are tabs on the screen so you are practicing all the way through the DVD.  Too many instructors I've found just talk throughout the DVD or want to perform rather than teach.  Definitely for beginners, but I feel this gives you a well rounded foundation.",1494633600,,489,4.7176470588235295

8455234,5,B0053HDNJU,"This system was bought for my brother, so the info is secondhand.  However, he knew nothing about playing the guitar (at age 63) and decided to try to learn a little.  He's worked on it off and on and quite proud of what he's learned.  He is able to actually play on his own and like what he hears.  He says he is still at the beginner stages, but is happy with the progress and the system.  Being able to SEE the instructions is a great help.",1402099200,,443,4.045977011494253
8455235,5,B0053HDNJU,"One of the best dvd tutorials out there.....easy to follow and thoughtfully produced.  If you always wanted to play guitar, this is for you",1400544000,,139,4.791666666666667
8455236,3,B0053HDNJU,"This is advertised as for BOTH acoustic and electric guitar, but it is really suited for electric. The content is good, just not appropriate for me.  If you are looking for beginning acoustic lessons I would look elsewhere...as I am now.",1391040000,,237,4.780487804878049
