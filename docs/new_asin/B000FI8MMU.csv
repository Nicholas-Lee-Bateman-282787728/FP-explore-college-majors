I've watched this with various groups of people, some will love it and some will not. I personally love it, and it blows my mind each and every time I will watch it. If you love heavy metal and the smoking the sweet leaf, this movie is for you. Anyone else should sit aside. Cheers!",1156204800,4,402,4.233766233766234

2566176,2,B000FI8MMU,This movie is worth owning if and only if you are nostalgic for 80's hard rock and heavy metal. The soundtrack itself is actually well done and pretty fun. The movie itself on the other hand...,1443571200,,193,4.388888888888889
2566177,5,B000FI8MMU,"I remembered seeing this for the first time in the 80`s on channel U.S.A up all night or when it was night flight. Being a rock n roller in the 80`s I couldn`t help but love it. Yeah its low budget but who cares. It entertains and the songs are pretty cool even to this day. Thor getting nailed with flying rubber octopuses while fighting the devil is classic. Synapse did a superb job as they always do on this dvd. Love it or hate it,it still beats this cgi crap we have to deal with today and way more watchable to me than the sci-fy channel b.s.

2566178,1,B000FI8MMU,"I Really have to say i chose a low rating on this particular movie because i really did hate it.  I thought this movie was lame and not worth renting again.  i rented it back in 86 and was into horror films,  this one was very cheesy from the beginning.  But,  toughing it through,  I made it to the ending and thought,  What?  years later  i started thinking about this one movie and wanted to rent it again, i couldn't find it anywhere,  i am buying it because it really stuck in my memory,  I need to have this one movie in my collection like an alcoholic needing a beer.

I gave it a 1 star because it truly is,  but some of us that seen it,  really get addicted to this low budget,  but crazy twist of a movie.  If you like strange films,  this is definitely  worth more than a 1 star.  it is a must have. I am sorry to be very generic in this review, but i really can't spoil the movie by telling anything about it.  If you are up to a challenge,  you got to watch it for just the craziness and the bragging rights of being able to say you saw it.  But please don't give the ending away,  Make you people watch it and let them wonder why they watched it too.",1388448000,,1164,3.965217391304348

2566180,5,B000FI8MMU,"Someone recommended this bad movie to me and I love it. Probably one of the best bad movies I've ever seen. I love the latex Muppet alien puppets they have in the film. And the giant demon alien that can barely move. lol And the latex bathtub toys getting thrown at the lead singer who turns into this warrior dude. And the artwork of Animal from The Muppet Show can be seen on the drumset, wicked cool gem! The puppeteers probably recommended it :) Awesome! The only things I didn't like about it was nothing really happens until the very end of the movie. Just lots of nude / sex scenes with the Rock stars and their groupie girlfriends. Though the campy bad acting is hilarious. One of the best scenes of bad acting is how everyone is having dinner and they just talk about needing to get work done so they get up and they don't eat once! How realistic, right? lol But yeah, this is one of the worst and funniest campy movies of all time! lol I strongly recommend it!",1353974400,,970,4.306010928961749
2566181,1,B000FI8MMU,I rarely write negative reviews. Im just trying to help fellow movie junkies. Please don't believe the hype this movie is slllllllllllllllllllllloooooooowwwwwwww . Not much T & A and this waste is bad meaning bad. I live in Vegas and I bet you a dime most real movie fans couldn't get thru this garbage.

2566182,4,B000FI8MMU,"WARNING: The review you are about to read will give Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare a great deal of praise. However this film should not be construed as good, interesting, or scary in any sense imaginable. So if you are seeking a legitimate horror movie then turn around and run screaming 'he's gone, the evils gone from here!"" as this will not be your cup of tea. Now that we have been clear on this matter let us just say that Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare was a stroke of B genius. It's almost as if the song Shout at the Devil was transposed into a film. Except it would be like a really horrific cover band's version with Vince Niel's brother Vance Niel at the helm. The level of confusion was elevated to new heights that only the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games/dp/B0002VEWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games</a>&nbsp;could possible comprehend. The only difference was a whole lot more mullets, horrible 80's rock, and a lead singer that looked like a David Lee Roth impersonator. Oh and we can't forget the hand puppets...yeah there were actual hand puppets.

Rock 'n' Roll nightmare wastes no time in the confusion department, being that within a couple minutes you have no idea what is going on. Apparently a family gets killed in an old farmhouse by something evil and a skeleton head comes screaming out of the oven. After that the camera follows a van driving on the road for a straight ten minutes. God forbid you're watching this high because you'd fully be freaking out at this point. Once the van finally arrives at this old farmhouse our band of misfits come stumbling out to deliver one of the most awkward scenes in movie history. Every actor butchered their lines stuttering and all. The drummer was our favorite. This guys had the WORST Australian accent that he would drift in and out of throughout the entire film. So turns out they're at this farmhouse to record some new tunes and fall prey to a punch of hand puppets from the darkside. The puppets somehow kill them one by one, take the murdered humans form, and strut around the house as if nothing happened. In the end turns out the lead singer is actually an angel that tricked the devil to show up at this farmhouse and....uh forget it. It's honestly too confusing too attempt to explain.

Rock 'n' Roll nightmare may offer nothing to the conventional movie watcher, but delivers an inordinate amount of laughs for the B lover. It is honestly one of the worst film's that has ever been created in the best way possible. It's worth the watch just to see this super fruity 80's band led by the David Lee Roth impersonator with his leopard blazer. Watching them record music in the studio was something every person should witness at least once in their lives.  The onscreen chemistry between this band was obviously something the world was lucky to have caught on film. The devil may have been the highlight of the evening. This thing couldn't have taken more then 15 minutes to whip up and looks exactly like creature on the cover. Really something MST3K should have done years ago. We implore you to get in touch with your inner mullet this Halloween and cue up a film that makes 80's hair metal look even worse.",1317686400,2,3251,4.770870337477797
2566183,1,B000FI8MMU,"Where did these high ratings come from. i rented it on its 2star rating, expecting a cheesy, fun B- Movie. This film is so bad i don't even think it can be classified as a B-movie.....more like an F. It drags horribly, fast forwarded through most of it, and the ending really doesnt tie the plot together. Most monsters just kill until everyone is dead at the end but this ending was ridiculously stupid, i wasn't amused.",1313712000,,421,4.48051948051948
2566184,1,B000FI8MMU,"The Tritons head out to a secluded farmhouse to record their newest Heavy Metal album, but the band must battle with a house full of demons when the gates of hell open up beneath them. ROCK 'N' ROLL NIGHTMARE is a terrible film with a terrible cast, terrible effects, and terrible music. Jon Mikl Thor's comically overstated performance takes the cake in this one, although the dreadful performances by the rest of the cast members are equally horrible in all the right ways. It is dreadfully boring from the very beginning, frequently forgetting that it is a bad Horror movie and not just a bad 80's music video... That is, until the final climactic battle between good and evil, where Thor bears his glistening chest and studded man-thong to take on a poorly-articulated devil puppet in hand-to-hand combat in one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments ever caught on film! Using some of the worst make-up and special effects in the genre, ROCK 'N' ROLL NIGHTMARE fails on every single level imaginable, but it is still a highly enjoyable piece of late-80's trash cinema. This is a must-see, must-own Horror flick for cult film fans!

2566185,5,B000FI8MMU,This film is hilariously amazing piece of art. Jon Mikl Thor in glittered rhinestone underwear gussetry fighting a cat like skinned devil is so COOL!,1264032000,3,149,5.0
2566186,3,B000FI8MMU,"Take a flick like ""Rock n' Roll Nightmare"", the huge hair, the screaming guitar and pounding drums of a RATT-like metal band named the Tritonz screaming out tunes like ""We Live to Rock"", and mix in plenty of gratuitous nudity, some goofy demonic sock puppets and you have a movie that could have only come out during the Reagan era.

As a fan of ""so-bad-its-good"" cinema, ""Rock n' Roll Nightmare"" has always been a favorite. This DVD is chock full of great extras, music videos, commentary tracks, behind the scenes footage and even a newly filmed intro and outro by Jon Mikl Thor himself. But lets face it, what really matters is the film itself. The great news is that the sound and picture quality have never looked or sounded better. The film looks pristine in all of it's goofy glory.

The basic story is that the Tritonz have gone to an isolated farmhouse in Canada to rehearse tunes for their upcoming album. Without distraction the band can no focus on their music. Unfortunately, the house they've chosen holds a gateway to Hell. Soon odd things begin to happen to various members of the band and their girlfriends. Soon some spittle-laden sock puppets show up and....well, I don't want to give anything away, so I'll stop there. Just be prepared for one seriously goofy climax, involving a HUGE puppet, and a silver-sequined man-bikini.

This movie brings the goofy, and if you are a fan of horrible horror along the lines of ""Hard Rock Zombies"", ""The Last Slumber Party"" or ""Class Reunion Massacre"" then you will love ""Rock n' Roll Nightmare"".",1234310400,10,1554,4.7481481481481485
2566187,5,B000FI8MMU,"I will go to the point. The film sucks in every way. Dialogues, acting, special efects, lightning, plot, unnecesary sex,  but if you are into really terrible, bizarre films, THIS ONE'S FOR YOU!!
The final fight, between Thor and the Devil Himself (or that's what I understood) would ashame even old Ed Wood!
A must!",1221264000,7,315,4.7272727272727275
2566188,3,B000FI8MMU,"Yes, it is kind of cheesy...yes, the acting ain't great...yes, the special effect are anything but special...and yes, it is about as ""B"" and a ""B"" movie can get. BUT HEY!It is THOR! and you have to pay homage to it. The music is cool, and it is a classic from decades past. I never saw this film till last month, and I thought it was cool. but hey, I already love most all things Thor, so I might be biased. The bonus features are great on the DVD release, and the DVD is top notch compared to some crappy releases. At least rent it...but why waste time, go ahead and buy one.",1167782400,6,576,4.106194690265487
2566189,3,B000FI8MMU,"Ultimately, I like this film, though I am a bit mixed on a few things.  The basic plot involves Thor and his band recording their new album in a small house in Canada.  The house was the site of a murder(we get to see it in the beginning of the film) years before.  Soon after their arrival, Thor and co. start getting assaulted by demons that look like Jim Henson creations on crack.  Chaos ensues and in the end we get a pretty cool twist as to the identity and motivations of Thor's character.  It just goes to prove as we all already know that nothing defeats the power and might of metal!!  The concept of a hard rock band menaced by cheap looking monsters is a B-movie fan's dream.  Unfortunately, the film's short running time is jam packed with long, boring filler scenes of....well, nothing really.  Lots of babble, and lingering camera shots of various crap that really serves no purpose.  The rock band, The Tritons, come across as alot more goody two-shoes than most cinematic rock bands.  No drugs, no profanity, and they're monogamus!  When the demons show up to cause mayhem, things start to look up, but the scenes are so brief, few and far between.  It's almost as though the ""horror"" aspect of the film was thrown in as an afterthought and the project originally started off as a low budget soap opera about a band rehearsing.  The songs should bring a smile to your face however.  What makes up for everything though is the final battle between Thor and the devil.  This scene alone is worth owning the dvd, and is one of the most entertaining scenes in my recent memory.  Very funny, very cool.  If only the rest of the film had taken this kind of outrageous tone(there seemed to be times when the film was actually trying to be somewhat serious, though that just might be my imagination), than this would be one of my favorite movies of all time.  Synapse did a great job with the quality of the disc, giving us some music videos and a documentary on Thor's career.  He seems awfully proud of the film to this day.  Hey, why not?  If I got to smack the devil around in my undies, I'd be rather proud myself, Bub.  Rock and Roll Nightmare, despite some shortcomings, is definitely worth the watch.  I gave it three stars, but three and a half is a bit more like it.  And remember, WE LIVE TO ROCK!",1162425600,12,2317,4.423167848699763
2566190,5,B000FI8MMU,"This movie contains one of the most insane ""WTF!"" climactic twists of any movie ever.  Crammed with excelent dish washing scenes, Stuffed condom like monsters, and some of the best Horror rock jam sessions of all time (incuding the classic songs: ""We live to rock!"", ""You give me energy!"", and the epicly sublime ""WE ACCEPT THE CHALLANGE!"") and of course...Stig.

It all comes togehter under the granite hard fist of the canadian rock god THOR! to make one of the best films ever to come out of the planet earth.

8122740,3,B000FI8MMU,"Rock and Roll Nightmare (released abroad as The Edge of Hell) is a classic Thunder God-sized slab of 80's horror cheese.  Starring Canadian heavy metal icon Jon Mikl Thor in the lead role, the plot revolves around a rock band called The Tritonz (who actually have some half-decent tunes including ""We Live to Rock"") and their groupies staying at a remote farm house to record music, but more often they end up having sex with each other.  You'd think these horn-dogs had never done it before!  Things get really bizarre when Beelzebub himself appears and starts taking out the horny groupies and band members one by one.  In the end, only Thor is left to fight the final battle with the Prince of Darkness.  For some reason, the demon selects plastic starfish as his weapon of choice, and the slow-motion scene where Thor defends himself by ripping apart these low-budget denizens of darkness has to be seen to be believed.  I won't spoil the ending, but there's a twist in what little plot the film has, and there's plenty of boobs, bad acting, cheap special effects and heavy metal music to keep the viewer occupied through at least one viewing.  I can't think of any other film that is so explosively bad, hilariously funny, artistically creative and FULL-ON METAL as Rock and Roll Nightmare.  So watch it when you've got nothing else to do on a weekend night, and then buy Thor's entire discography including the soundtrack to this film.  The power of THOR, THE THUNDER GOD compels you, so don't be left standing on The Edge of Hell!",1476662400,3,1537,4.684014869888476
