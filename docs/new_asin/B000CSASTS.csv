8343624,4,B000CSASTS,"I came across this listing while searching for a ""Hollywood's Mysteries and Scandals"" (a long-cancelled show""). This vhs set is dated in the early 1990's, so don't expect any updated information. This is a quick run-through of some of Hollywood's tragic and weird tales of the ""stars"", some well-known and some not so.  The narrative is clear and concise with no unnessary dramatazations.  Some of the clips and photos would not be shown on any current documentaries, so this makes this a very rare find.  For a used VHS set, the cost was reasonable.",1351036800,,550,4.829787234042553
