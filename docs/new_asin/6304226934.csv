Parts of the videos, thus parts of songs, are chopped out.  It really  upsets the flow of some songs.  I'm sure not happy about that, but it is  always nice to have some VH in my DVD library.  So approach with caution.  And I have no idea why these cuts were made.  It couldn't have been for  the sake of shortening the running time, because at 65 minutes this DVD is  in no danger of having too much info for a disc side.

811445,2,6304226934,"It missing a lot of videos, make no mistake.  In the case of the early Roth videos, the clips were so primitive (I think the three clips from their first album were all filmed the same day, just like AC/DC did for their ""Back In Black"" video and Def Leppard did for their ""High N' Dry"" clips) that it doesn't really matter if you have them on DVD or not...go find them on YouTube and watch them in all the clarity you need.  But the later clips with Hagar were high-production affairs that got regular MTV airplay and should definitely be here.  Like KISS, this band clearly needs to release a proper comprehensive music video collection in the DVD era.

Some of mine were not so I had to buy another DVd to complete my library.  You also have to take note of the David Lee Roth and post-DLR years, depending upon whether you liked him or not.

It puzzles me as to why they chose to go with just the ""1984"" era material. There were promos shot for the first album. ""Dance The Night Away"" was a live promo. ""Loss Of Control"", while not on the CD version, would've been funny to watch (You Tubers can find it). ""And the Cradle Will Rock"" did have them lip syncing on a TV show. 3 promos from ""Fair Warning"" were MTV staples, and let us not forget ""(Oh) Pretty Woman"" that was taken off of MTV due to controversy.

It's not a bad collection, but other than ""Without You"" with Gary Cherone (VH III) , not much focus on making this a jam packed collection of hits and rarities that it could've been. ""Best of Bowie"" it is not.",1177718400,,868,4.286585365853658

Oh my goodness, it's the best video ever made, this DVD however contains a live jam of the band at some venue instead. What a major dissapointment. I would have the price I did for ONLY the DREAMS - BLUE ANGELS VIDEO ""ALONE"". But instead I get this.

No this would have warranted a ""1"" rating, but the Right Now vid, bumps it up 1/2 point and the collection of the rest up another 1/2 point. Heck even the Humans Being vid cuts out all the Twister footage the original video contained.

So I'll stick with the rating of ""2"" and shake my head in utter discust at the idiot that put this package together without including THE BLUE ANGELS video footage, what is your problem anyway?

I'm confused with the Van Halen archives.  It seems that Warner Bro's is waiting until were all deceised until they release a good DLR erra DVD compilation or live show.

811521,4,6304226934,"First, this is a great DVD collection of some truly amazing Van Halen stuff.  It's only an hour long, but the collection is a very well thought out and executed program, chronologically tracing their musical career, and spanning through all three lead vocalists: David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar, and Gary Cherone.

But I've got a bone to pick with other reviewers - come on, there's got to be some people out there that know what they're talking about.  Everyone needs to stop abusing Gary Cherone.  He is a truly talented singer, well worthy of the company he keeps.  Van Halen III bombed for a lot of reasons, but as we all know, it's easiest to blame the lead vocalist - look at your own band.  These people need to listen to Pornograffitti.  Then I'll take their Cherone opinion with more interest.  I mean look at the shoes he had to fill.  I'm truly glad that he didn't try to sound like Hagar and Roth, and sounded like Cherone.  That in itself commands a lot of respect.",1132444800,2,974,4.482954545454546

I always thought Dave had an ego problem but when you read between the lines Eddie is the one with a problem.one-eyed David Lee Roth Fan (Dave can do no wrong)",1123459200,3,375,4.295774647887324
811523,4,6304226934,"I think we are going to have to have another Van Halen video compilation. I am one of the biggest Van Halen fans you will ever meet(see my ""So You'd Like To...discover the music and controversy of Van Halen"" guide)so when I saw this DVD at a music and movie store at a mall close to where I live,I picked it up. How does this video compilation meausure up? Read on for my review of this:

This DVD,while it could have been a little better(I'll cover why that is later on in my review of this)is pretty good. The videos here are in chronological order,so that is a good thing,and the DVD opens with Van Halen's music video for JUMP that they filmed back with David Lee Roth in 1984--a really good way to open a DVD that has Van Halen music videos on it,because it is a really cool video. Up next is the music video for PANAMA,which shows Van Halen performing the song before a crowd of people with the original studio music for that song in the background,among a bunch of other cool things in it--another great video and another winner for this DVD. Then their is the video for HOT FOR TEACHER,which is hillarious,sassy,cool,and one of the funniest music videos I have ever seen.

Then,exit--David Lee Roth. Enter--Sammy Hagar. After this DVD gives you three Van Halen videos with David Lee Roth,the remainder of the music videos on here are Van Halen/Sammy Hagar videos,and the last video is the music video for WITHOUT YOU,which was shot with Gary Cherone,who became the lead singer for VH after Hagar quit the group--that was a really bad video and a really bad song(as far as my opinion goes at least,that song was the only hit Van Halen had when Gary Cherone was at the mic)but the rest of the videos here are really cool in their own ways. The black and white video for FINISH WHAT YA STARTED is really cool and has a cute girl in it,the video for DON'T TELL ME(WHAT LOVE CAN DO)helps a song with a really good message be a really good video(watching that video is like watching a movie)and the last Van Halen/Sammy Hagar video on here is HUMANS BEING,which,if I am correct,was the last music video Van Halen made with Sammy Hagar. It is a very cool video,and I find it to be one of Van Halen's most underrated songs.

But,the question you probably already have on your mind is why did I give this video compilation four stars instead of five. I'll answer that right here and right now:one of the reasons is because the blue collar video for DREAMS,which shows Van Halen performing the song live in Los Angeles in 1993 when they were on their tour supporting their FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL KNOWLEDGE album,along with footage of news clips that talked about VH's performance there,interview clips with the band(that is during the video;during those parts you see interview clips from when Eddie Van Halen,Alex Van Halen,Sammy Hagar,and Michael Anthony were talking about their tour at the time,just so you don't get confused)along with clips of VH fans talking about the band,etc. A really good video and it should serve as a good memory for several VH fans--however,the original video for that song should have been included also. Having that one video with Gary Cherone on here makes this DVD a somewhat complete career spanning video compilation(well,when it comes to the lead singers of Van Halen)but since Van Halen's era with Cherone was arguably their worst era(ask several other VH fans and there is a 99 percent chance that they will say the same thing that I just did),if they were going to include a Cherone video as part of this compialtion,they should have included the video for FIRE IN THE HOLE,which is the other(and last)video Van Halen did with Gary Cherone--even though VHIII(the Van Halen album that feautures Gary Cherone on lead vocals)was and still is really bad(see my review)that was actually a cool video. But the main reason why I am knocking off one point here is because their are not enough videos with David Lee Roth on here. Sure,Van Halen had more videos with Sammy Hagar then they had with David lee Roth--but the Roth videos were very cool,and too many of them are missing from this DVD!

Overall,like I already said,this is a pretty good DVD,although we will need one more Van Halen DVD. I'd say get this DVD right now(even though their should have been more Roth videos on here and even though I like David Lee Roth better than Sammy Hagar,I like Hagar also,so I was able to enjoy all of the videos on here!)but that the next DVD with Van Halen videos should have two DVDS in one package. DVD one should consist of EVERY music video Van Halen made with David Lee Roth and some interview footage as well. DVD two should consist of EVERY music video Van Halen made with Sammy Hagar--meaning that you get both the original video for DREAMS and the blue collar video for the same song,the video for AMSTERDAM that did not get shown on TV,as well as their two videos with Gary Cherone(again,their era with Cherone wasn't great,but the FIRE IN THE HOLE video was cool)and interviews should also be on that DVD. And when that DVD was released,us Van Halen fans should be quite pleased-like I already said,get this DVD until then,and if you want to see more VH videos,you can log on their official website([...])and see clips of their videos,and some of their videos may be available for downloading off of the internet.

811524,5,6304226934,"I love Van Halen, they're one of my favorite bands and while I prefer David Lee Roth to Sammy Hagar and this DVD contains only 3 Roth videos I was still pleasantly surprised. This is a very cool collection of videos, except for the last one ""Without You"" which feautres post-Hagar, Gary Cherone. Cherone, for all those people who don't know, was recruited after Hagar left and then was fired and/or quit when the album

""3"" became Van Halens worst selling album. Gary Cherone sounds like a drunk guy, who begins singing Sammy Hagar karaoke. He's that bad. But as for the other videos, here are my thoughts and oppinions:

Jump:This is a pretty popular song and video, but it is not my favorite Van Halen song, the video is pretty cool though, except for the fact that David Lee Roth is wearing female clothing.

Panama: This is a really cool song, Eddie sounds great, and the lyrics are good too.

Hot for Teacher: A funny and catchy song. This is one of the coolest Van Halen songs out of a long line of them.

When It's Love: A really good Van Halen love song. Sammy Hagars voice really carries on this song.

Finish What Ya Started: Yet another good song, the black & white video is pretty cool.

Poundcake: This is a very cool Sammy Hagar & Van Halen song. The video is really good with A LOT of hot chicks.

Runaround: More good songs. This isn't the best song ever, but it is still good....

Right Now: Good song, good message. The video is really good.

Dreams: The album version is a LOT better, but this is one of my favorite songs.

Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do): Due to my TV, I couldn't hear most of the song but the video is good, and like ""Right Now"" has a good message.

Can't Stop Loving You: Really good song, video is somewhat of a sequel to ""Don't Tell Me""

Not Enough: Good song, nuff said.

Humans Being: Really catchy song and you actually hear Eddie talk.

Without You: Ahh. The dreaded Cherone video. The video ITSELF is not that bad. The band: Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, & Michael Anthony is terrific. But then there's the matter of Gary Cherone.

The first three videos (""Jump"", ""Panama"", ""Hot for Teacher"") have rightfully taken their place as some of the all-time greatest music videos.  The DIY, powerfully simple ""Jump"", the goofy ""Panama"" and the outrageously hilarious ""Hot for Teacher"" (featuring a persecuted nerd named Waldo, child stand-ins for Dave, Eddie, Alex & Michael, and three of the most ridiculously gorgeous ""teachers"" you'll ever see:  two clad in skimpy bikinis, one as a dominatrix) make this DVD worth watching.
Then, if you have the stomach for it, watch Van Halen metamorphosize into cheeseball ""Van Hagar"" once the Red Rocker takes over and then metamorphosize again into the horrific ""Van Has-Been"" as Gary Cherone takes the helm.
It was mildly interesting to see the Van Hagar video of their performance of the putrid ""Dreams"" at the Whisky-a-Go-Go, which is NOT located in downtown L.A. (as one Amazon reviewer erroneously puts it), but about 10 miles west of there on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, CA.  Actually, I only included this paragraph as a geography lesson.  Sorry.
Also noteworthy is the absence of the bizarre, low-budget ""Oh!  Pretty Woman"" video dating from 1982 which features Roth as Napoleon Bonaparte and the rest of the band looking like members of the Village People.  It's not a glaring omission, but something worth noting.
Overall, I would rent, ***NOT*** buy this DVD and just watch the first 3 videos.  Hopefully, Warner Bros. will get its act together and put together a more proper video compilation, which live concert footage from the Roth era and some interviews to boot.",1084752000,28,1857,5.062295081967213

It's alright for the Van Halen fan that is only intrested in the hits but for the serious die-hard Van Halen fan we want more. This DVD should had been at least 2 discs, every single Van Halen video, commentary, and a lot of bonus materials. I also think Van Halen should consider releasing there 1983 performance at the US festival cause from what I hear it was a excellent performance but I would definitly like to see a more upgraded DVD video collection in the future.",1081555200,3,542,4.484848484848484

I don't mean to be rude about the new guy but its just that the music before him is so inviorating and inspiring that the kids are inspired to go for their dreams and be the best they can be especially when they hear the song Dreams. I bought the DVD and played it on my 61 inch large screen tv and my son and I jumped up and down, danced and it was the best time in my life with my son. It also gives me huge inspiration to accomplish my goals here at the farm. Thank you VanHalen for waking us up again and giving us inspiration to be the best we can be. I love you.

811581,4,6304226934,"It's hard to capture an era.  My only complaint with this dvd (and it's a minor complaint really), is that people might miss how important david lee roth was to Van Halen's success.  For those of us who were there when Van Halen first came out, it really was David Lee Roth who *seriously* helped push them to the top - his flamboyancy and vocalizations helped provide that ""entertainment value"" which makes nobody groups into somebody groups.  As the phrase goes, it's a heck of a lot harder to break into the big time than it is to stay in the big time, and david lee roth is part of why they made it into the big time (could've they with sammy?  I seriously doubt it).  This is a decent dvd, but don't trivialize how important david lee roth was wrt them reaching the big time.
Nonetheless, it is nice to have at least some of those old-time van halen sights/sounds still available for our viewing pleasure.",1080172800,3,910,4.425149700598802

WHEN IT'S LOVE, RIGHT NOW, CAN'T STOP LOVIN' YOU, DREAMS.....these videos (and songs) are outstanding, not to mention ALL the others with Sammy, but you people seem to think otherwise. Shame on you.

811612,2,6304226934,Only three videos with Dave?  I would have expected all of Dave era videos including the live stuff and (Oh)Pretty Woman.  That would have left room for a Vol 2 with Hagar (who really cares about the Gary era).  I'm surprised that the boys would have passed an obvious way to make double the cash and please all of the people.  I'll keep looking for an acceptable bootleg.,1071964800,,372,4.426470588235294

1. David Lee Roth in his VH videos. Sound is excellent
2. All Sammy's videos with VH. Super sound and picture.
3. Gary Cherone (ex-Extreme) with VH. super sound and picture
Van Halen is like a rock kingdom which changes and chooses it's ministers for certain period of time. If you're really VH fan, you'd already have this DVD. If not, go ahead and buy it. Eddie Van Halen rules.",1068768000,,419,4.25

Despite the fact that I favor Hagar over Roth, I was a little dissapointed, I know that a DVD has more space than that, there should have been more Dave videos, and more Gary videos.

This band would not be if it wasn't for him and no matter how many hits Sammy Haggar helped make...it just doesn't make sence to exclude Diamond Dave! Van Halen's one of teh few bands in History that has been able to go through two singers and still have huge success.
I think I will stick to the  bootleg material. At least they offer the early videos that seem to blow away the Sammy era. I think the Greatest hits could have been 50/50 but for obvious reasons it isn't. It si still great to have FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED...I just hope part 2  does that.....",1048291200,4,599,4.339285714285714

Roth doesn't make it on the tape as much as Sammy, but he was around more during the big music video era.  Rewind and rewatch the Right Now video over and over and catch all those words you missed the first time.  This item will not let you down.

I hate to disappoint some of you, but since I like Sammy better than Dave, I thought  that Finish What Ya Started, Poundcake, and Runaround were the best ones. I  do wish they had more for Dave though. I know it was made too soon for a  video from Gary on here, but since I haven't seen them I wish one of his  videos were on here.

811621,4,6304226934,"I agree with all statements made in prior reviews, except the one about the edited videos.  The videos were not edited for this DVD -- they are shown exactly as they were played on MTV.  Unfortunately, MTV and record  execs force many bands to shorten their songs for both radio and video  airplay in order to allow more time for other songs and, of course,  commercials.  That being said, this is a good collection of videos for any  Van Halen fan.  I was somewhat surprised that ALL of the VH videos were not  included in the collection, however, which explains why I am not giving it  5 stars.  Notably absent were the videos for ""Feels So Good,""  ""Top of the World,"" ""Amsterdam,"" and ""Fire in the  Hole.""",944611200,13,708,4.480314960629921
