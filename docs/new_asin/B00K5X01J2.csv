WIlliam, Kate and Bryn's collaborative knowledge and experience is evident throughout the entire DVD. Their love and passion  for The Son-Rise Program is contagious and as I watched the DVD, I found myself captivated and wanting to hear more.

Just a few of the many reasons I love this dvd.-

-even if you haven't taken the program - this DVD will help it all ""make sense""

-This DVD will crystallize The Son-Rise Program for parents who have already taken a Start-Up (or an additional advanced course) and help them be more effective in their playrooms

- Volunteers working in The Son-Rise Program are going to see and hear useful tools and techniques to put into practice and help make even more effective Son-Rise Programs.

So in all- I love the Autism Micro Tutotials DVD!",1401235200,3,870,4.766666666666667

8656120,3,B00K5X01J2,"The son rise program does have the right idea but they are in it to make money. The basic idea is spending time with your child and relating to their interests. So, they will interact with you more and by more interaction with you, observing you, they can learn from you. More time you spend with your child and interact with them, do what they like to do, the more your child will watch and learn from you. You do not have to spend thousands of dollars on their program to figure that out. They are not going to give you a secret password. They will only go over ""techniques"" to help you and your child interact and communicate. Which is great but you can do all of this for free.",1471392000,5,681,4.206106870229007
