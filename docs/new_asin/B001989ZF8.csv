3424160,5,B001989ZF8,"This is the same Mill Creek ""100 Family Favorites"" collection that was previously issued with Judy Garland and Fred Astaire on the cover except this release pictures Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, and Bing Crosby on the cover (am VERY happy to see the wonderful Lamour pictured as a full-fledged star member of the Road team which isn't always the case in Road movie releases on dvd).  This is a very good collection of films but please note these are ""public domain"" titles which means they are no longer copyrighted (at least most of them) and aren't made from studio masters so don't expect perfection in picture quality.  Still, for the price you can hardly beat it if you enjoy vintage movies.  (Also note a few of the ""movies"" such as those with Shirley Temple, Rin Tin Tin, and W. C. Fields are not feature-length films but short subjects running from 5 to 15 minutes).

Highpoints of the set include the pre-stardom (although she is the lead in most of them) Shirley Temple shorts, the tv film THE BORROWERS with Dame Judith Anderson and Eddie Albert, a slightly racy pre-comedy GOODBYE LOVE with Charles Ruggles, Verree Teasdale, and Mayo Methot; Douglas Fairbanks Sr in the silent THE IRON MASK, THE KID, one of Charlie Chaplin's best and also starring the fantastic toddler actor Jackie Coogan; LAY THAT RIFLE DOWN a rare chance today to see the hillbilly comedienne movie star Judy Canova;  THE LITTLE PRINCESS, the lone Shirley Temple feature in the set; the silent THE LOST WORLD; the terrific Hope/Lamour comedy MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE;  the Oscar-nominated OUR TOWN with William Holden and Martha Scott, Buster Keaton's silent classic THE PALEFACE,  the movie from which the cover photo was taken ROAD TO BALI; Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon in THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, THE SON OF MONTE CRISCO with Joan Bennett, Louis Hayward, and George Sanders; one of the greatest films of the 1930's A STAR IS BORN starring Janet Gaynor, Fredric March, and May Robson;  the comedy/drama/musical SWING HIGH SWING LOW with Carole Lombard, Fred MacMurray, and Dorothy Lamour; TEXAS, BROOKLYN, AND HEAVEN starring Guy Madison, Diana Lynn, and Irene Ryan some 15 years before she achieved stardom as Granny in The Beverly Hillbillies; TREASURE OF FEAR with the unlikely combo of Jack Haley (""The Wizard of Oz"") and noir queen Ann Savage (""Detour""); the allstar musical TIL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY, and the obscure ""B"" film UNCLE JOE starring comedian Slim Summerville and future tv star Gale Storm (My Little Margie).  That's just a few of the interesting films in this set that is well worth the money if you like vintage films (there are a also a handful of post-1960 films in the set).",1337904000,47,2672,4.854945054945055

3424173,5,B001989ZF8,"I saw quite a few of these movies with they first came out when I was a kid.  And a lot of them came out when I was too young to go to the movies.  These are classic.  This isn't too say they're even good movies, but they bring back old memories and have an old time charm to them.  Today's young generation won't see what those my age saw in them and still do see in them.  But this is great for us old timers.",1384473600,8,411,3.7325581395348837

3424176,1,B001989ZF8,"I bought this for a gift for my in laws.  The movies are in really bad shape, not remade, and they are pretty ""C"" rated movies to begin with if not lower.  They were very unhappy with the movies.  I would not recommend this movie pack.",1373587200,2,235,4.065217391304348

Plus they are not so old that the grandparent influence goes out the window. They are still a collection of the actors that KNEW acting in a form that will maybe not return as it was.",1369785600,8,295,4.192982456140351

8272432,3,B001989ZF8,"The movie ""Son of Monte Christo"" is one of my favorite swashbucklers; it is actually based on a story written by the grandson of Alexander Dumas, who wrote ""The Count of Monte Christo"", which is so famous.  I like this one better and it is actually the story which gave rise to the creation of the Zorro character who is modeled after The Torch in this film.  Feature actors are Louis Hayward, Joan Bennett, George Sanders, Clayton Moore, Florence Bates. (Clayton Moore had a minor role in this film; George Sanders plays the villain).  I actually enjoyed all of the Bob Hope and Bing Crosby movies of the ""Road to . . . "" series (Road to Shanghai, Road to Rio, etc...) that is where the cover photo comes from, but I don't know if they are all in this collection.",1415836800,,764,4.404255319148936
