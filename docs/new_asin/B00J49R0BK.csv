Just purchased Karneval: Complete Series Limited Edition. Having over the years kept up with the ongoing trends of anime. I really have noticed that anime like this don't seem to flood the market. Karneval certainly is geared more after closer introspection for the female audience especially because of all the cute anime guys and anime girls pretty much everywhere. It's not to say it is not for guys too but it seems from MyAnimeList and other anime fan communities guys dislike it for the obvious fanservice geared toward the female audience. I'm not sure this is too off the mark but if you are open-minded then you can also enjoy this. I still like Karneval perhaps for this aspect because it is going for the female anime fan audience in mind in a world where most anime just seem to be geared for the male anime fan in mind.

That said Karneval has a very interesting unique Fantasy premise. It delivers this surreal and magical fun feeling. The two main guy characters are Nai and Gareki. Nai is really cute and part of the reason decided to get Karneval: Complete Series Limited Edition was the voice acting for Nai was so adorable. Thanks in part owed to Hiro Shimono. Gareki also has a really noticeable voice actor who is Hiroshi Kamiya. His voicing here is at play as a mixture of his two voice types: serious and funny.

Now with concern to the English dub to this series, well, truthfully it took time to get into the series in English since had seen the subtitled online version back in Spring 2013. It sounds different entirely and I am not sure feel Grey Ayres is the right one for Gareki. Although after a while of hearing grew accustomed to it. Sean Michael Teague voicing Nai was actually pretty ok. Perhaps the voice actors that stood out and gave some of the better charming performances were Ian Sinclair as Hirato, J. Michael Tatum voicing Tsukitachi, and Vic Mignogna as Karoku. In the end, though for Karneval glad it contains both subtitled and a dubbed version.

The animation as many anime fans have pointed out has very high production values accredited to Manglobe (Deadman Wonderland, Ergo Proxy).

FUNIMATION Entertainment

Discover the dark side of the big top in Karneval--a kaleidoscopic visual parade through a twisted fantasy landscape.

Circus is a super-powered security force of entertainers who keep villains off the streets by serving up justice with a side of razzle-dazzle. Despite their best efforts, a sinister organization named Kafka is gaining power throughout the world using grotesque monsters to carry out their plots. When Circus saves a mysterious boy from Kafka's grasp, the kid gets swept up in the crime-fighting spectacle--but why was Kafka after him in the first place? From the studio that brought you Michiko & Hatchin and Deadman Wonderland comes one demented freak show.

It basically sums up the series. Karneval has fighting sequences that from fan input seems to be rated highly. The cuteness aspect in the series though is very much the focus. Still there are instances where things aren't serious and just hilarious but it eventually does get serious. This series was a Spring 2013 Anime Season offering which watched online beside the also airing The Devil is a Part-Timer! and Date A Live by FUNIMATION. For the conclusion think this is way better than The Devil is a Part-Timer! simply because while open-ended it still gave the impression it was the only reasonable way it could end. Personally one of the main reasons picked up Karneval: Complete Series Limited Edition was that an anime like this doesn't come often and even then doesn't get licensed here in North America. Sentai Filmworks licenses a lot of ""unique"" anime but FUNimation does only occasionally. Karneval is just that very unique, so had to get this.

By the way, The Devil is a Part-Timer! is also another unique and interesting anime series, so for male anime fans who already think this might not be for you then that series was pretty hilarious. It also had high animation production values like Karneval. Then again worth looking into is Date A Live too. Out of the two though probably Date A Live because The Devil is a Part-Timer! has a sudden and mundane ending that doesn't close it well and it feels just like it sneaked up on you in how it just ends. Meanwhile you have Date A Live which is good as a standalone and then you have Date A Live 2, Season 2 of Date A Live, to look forward to. Keep in mind though Date A Live 2 hasn't officially been licensed in the United States yet so you will have to see it online via FUNIMATION and perhaps in the future it will be licensed for home video release by FUNimation Entertainment.

6332636,5,B00J49R0BK,"By far one of the best new upincoming animes of 2014. Rivals Attack on Titan atleast in my eyes. Made of world of mystery, wounder, horror, and GodDamn cute characters into one of the most thrilling, heart throbbing, edge of my seat rocking series I have ever seen. Great opening for a series and one of the best english dubs i have seen in a while. I really hope they pick it up for another season, I would really like to see an actual series come out of this short 13 ep run; so support the artists and buy a copy (when its on sale lol). If not still watch it online seriously a good anime.... if you appreciate anime. If your just looking for cheap action this may not be for you.",1404172800,6,683,4.142857142857143
6332637,5,B00J49R0BK,"I'm an avid anime watcher. I've seen a lot of shows and I think this one is very much worth the purchase. It is sort of left open-ended but that is because A. There is more of the story in the manga volumes and B. They are considering making a season two if sales are good. If you liked this anime, buy it. Help support an additional season. <3",1402876800,,344,4.0
6332638,5,B00J49R0BK,"Although the first episode scared the bejeezus out of me, I'm thoroughly enjoying it. There's a good blend of horror, mystery, suspense and enjoyment in this one show. And the casting and voice acting for the English dub are amazing!",1402444800,4,233,4.85
6332639,3,B00J49R0BK,"Nai is searching for Karoku, whom he was with for a long time, then Karoku went away and there was a pool of red water and he never came back. Gareki is a thief and all he really wants is Nai's bracelet, which looks expensive. The bracelet belonged to Karoku, but Nai is happy to give it up in exchange for some help. So Gareki blows up the mansion where Nai was being help captive and they make a timely escape. And then a circus gets involved and things really start getting crazy.

I had heard that Karneval was pretty but kind of a mess. I didn't realize how true this was until I had finished it and looked back on it all. A lot of it was plain ridiculous, but fun, and some of it was interesting, but sadly the interesting stuff isn't really ever explained. I thought the story was well enough contained until the last episode when I realized that there were pretty much no answers and it finished off in such a way that I felt there was a lot more story off in the distance somewhere beyond the horizon... or in the 13 volumes of the ongoing manga.

This series reminded me of Pandora Hearts. There is another story with pretty visuals, intriguing mysteries, and very few answers. Both series are odd in that I didn't feel like I had wasted my time even though there were no answers in the end (something that is normally very important to me). The journey was entertaining enough that I forgave such a failing. But consider yourself warned.

(I watched this series on Funimation's website and have no intention of buying the DVDs)",1400716800,,1538,4.389473684210526
6332670,5,B00J49R0BK,"Came in on time and in perfect condition. It's a S.A.V.E edition but like most save editions, it has a reversible cover that shows the artwork without the big green save logo on the side. What I found interesting about this covers artwork is that I felt I had seen it before and I think it was on the limited edition release that go's for about 45 dollars on here. I thought that was an extra bonus.

This show is simple to explain as long as I don't spoil anything. It's about Nai and Gareki becoming friends and how their fates eventually intertwine with an organization named circus. I love this show for it's characters, it's cute/creepy storyline, and HOLY S*** THE ART IS BEAUTIFUL. It's a fun experience and gorgeous to look at.

Something I didn't know I would be getting when I brought this, is that it's a blu ray/dvd combo pack. Which is nice if I want to lend it to someone who doesn't have a blu ray player. Added bonuses everywhere.

Overall, I spent only 20 bucks on a whole series, got it on blu ray and DVD, with some amazing cover art, and it came on time with no damages. I am very pleased.",1470009600,7,1109,4.29665071770335

6332672,5,B00J49R0BK,"I'll keep it quick, and to the point: It's a good series. The characters were great, interesting, and well designed (though, the artwork seems to be more geared towards females.) The plot was interesting and kept me engaged (even the the artwork seems to be geared towards females, I think the plot is wonderful for anybody) though the ending left me wanting more. I preferred the original Japanese voice actors, but the English actors were pretty good too. I would say 4.5 out of 5 stars total.",1463270400,,495,4.7011494252873565
6332673,3,B00J49R0BK,"I waited a good while to order this. Mainly because the previews made it seem a little strange. So during the beginning of 2016 between seasons, I bought Karneval. Just because there was nothing else to buy. I sort of regret it. This anime wasn't bad mind you. It just didn't make me give a crap. The premise is ok, and there are some pretty good characters. But there just isn't anything solid and meaningful that makes you excited about it. This is all just my opinion. And opinions are subjective. But I suggest doing serious research before buying. And if you buy, do it only to avoid severe boredom. lol",1455667200,2,608,4.486486486486487
6332674,3,B00J49R0BK,"The plot was okay.  The characters were okay.  It just wasn't very exciting.  And the dub is difficult to get past.  I love dubbed - I rarely watch subtitled, so I'm not a puritan snob.  But the voice for one of the characters was soooo whiny, I had a hard time getting past it.  I may have liked the entire series better had the voice not been so jarring.  The animation itself is really pretty.  But It has to be great to get a four star, and awesome to get a five star, and this series was neither.",1447804800,,501,4.040816326530612

6332698,5,B00J49R0BK,this anime is so interesting and gory?  if you are looking for a cosplay inspiring anime this is the one for you. that being said I did think it ended in a weird place so I guess I would watch the anime after reading the manga but that is just a suggestion.,1406419200,2,257,3.9423076923076925

8647940,4,B00J49R0BK,"Arrived very quickly, only downside is that the voice acting is... well not very fitting for the characters. I'd recommend crunchy roll, you can watch the whole season in subbed and the voice acting is so much better",1490054400,,216,4.7105263157894735

8647942,4,B00J49R0BK,Love this series but the eng dub voice acting feels too flat for some characters. Sorry but sub is definitely better in this case. I still love the English regardless but we get more emotion from the sub.,1484611200,,204,4.394736842105263
8647943,4,B00J49R0BK,"What it comes down to is family, albeit a family of freaks. The story isn't so much about metahuman security force Circus and their near-lethal run-ins with the criminal organization Kafka -- that part is never explained enough to make much sense -- but KARNEVAL is a beautiful mash-up of the dark, the scary, the super-cute, and the X-MEN, and its gothic fairytale backgrounds and monsters highlight a thoroughly kawaii cast, including many of the villains. Everyone looks fabulous, and it's hard not to think of young thief Garecki, our POV character, as a rough trade interloper who's fallen down the (bioengineered) rabbit hole into a wonderland of queens.

Okay, so this is a two-season show with only one season's worth of episodes, but if you can live with KARNEVAL's open-ended conclusion, it's really the story of how the cynical teen Garecki, the nave youngster Nai, and the flamboyant, blond man-child Yogi evolve from strangers into brothers. Admittedly, they're brothers who wind up literally in bed together in one episode, and not only does Garecki rock a steampunk-inspired coat and goggles ensemble, but later doffs it to reveal he's wearing a single-strap boy toy tank top to die for. So what's wrong with a little female fan service?

Take KARNEVAL as the 13-episode torso that it is, and it's not bad at all. By the way, I found the Japanese soundtrack preferable to the English language dub; Nai's English voice sounds too mature for the character, and Garecki's is just...off, for some reason.",1481846400,,1515,4.984189723320158

8647947,4,B00J49R0BK,Decent show. Plot leaves a lot to be desired. Visually very exciting to watch. Ending leaves room for season 2 which I hope comes about.,1470873600,,136,4.48
