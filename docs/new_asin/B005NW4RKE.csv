8480796,2,B005NW4RKE,"It's more than time for documentaries to stop saying in a derisive tone ""the white man"" ruined things in America, and with a critical tone the narrator criticised ""white people"" who fled the city and left poor blacks there and that the special thing that happened to clean up the river was the first black Mayor Stokes.  I was shocked that such hateful racism (yes, it is racism against any color) is still acceptable. First of all, you can start calling settlers ""Europeans"" instead of white (that is filled with negative judgment) and you can also recognize that poorer people of all colors and ethnicities stayed in the city while people of all colors and ethnicities left, if they so chose. Many people of all colors stayed in the city and continue to stay. It really is offensive to continually blame ""the white man"". It is not OK.  If you removed all the racist judgment remarks ad teh narrator's critical tone this would be a lot better, but as it is, it promotes a guilty white uber-liberal mindset, which doesn't help the issues of pollution.",1403395200,,1051,4.675675675675675

Then there was the fairly regular occurences of ""fire on the creek"", where the fire department would have to come and ""put the creek (fire) out""!

College buddies from Cleveland would get regular ribbings about all that.

I actually saw this video on a public TV station before buying the DVD.  It was so great to see how much the ""old disaster"" was cleaned up, by effort-over-time and simply some applied thinking and ""doing what was right"" ...so I HAD to get the DVD to review occasionally, and help to ""spread the word"".

I'm not sure that the clean-up which has been accomplished could have been justified - AHEAD of time - by the criteria often demanded TODAY by many of the ""industrialists"", cost-wise or otherwise.
For this ""basically conservative guy"", seeing this was necessary to reinforce my feeling that SOMETIMES we just need to do certain things based on fundamentals and principles.  Sometimes the costs vs. benefits just don't become very clear until there's been significant progress already, in direction(s) that had a more intangible or harder-to-quantify drive...",1360972800,,1256,4.980861244019139
