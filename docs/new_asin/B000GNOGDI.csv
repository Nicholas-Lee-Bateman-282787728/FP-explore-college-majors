2615504,4,B000GNOGDI,"I have watched a couple in the series and so far they are excellent.  Being a Bible believing Christian, I try to keep up with happenings in Israel - past, present and future.  If you love Israel, you'll love this series....",1174089600,19,224,4.439024390243903
2615505,5,B000GNOGDI,This was a fascinating series on the miracles of the forming of the modern state of Israel. I would suggest it for anyone who loves the Nation of Israel and her people.,1171238400,17,168,4.28125
2615506,5,B000GNOGDI,"When the Roman General Vespasian and his son Titus smashed the city of Jerusalem and burned King Herod's (the Jewish) Temple, the Israelites (the Jews) ceased to be a nation.  Those that survived were dispersed into the far reaches of the Roman Empire, a typical fate of any population that rebelled or defied the Roman government.  The thinking was that a dispersed people would never again organize to rebel, and that they would cease to be identified as an ethnic group.  Time alone would absorb them into the existing culture and forever erase their unique identity.

But is was not to be.

Israel returned as a nation on May 14, 1948, and many consider this to be a modern-day miracle.  The reestablishment of Israel and its many battles with its hostile neighbors Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, are documented in this 13-part series by Michael Greenspan.  Greenspan uses each episode to document whether a ""miracle"" may have taken place in certain events in Israel's history. He documents Hitler's Holocost and how this led to international sympathy for a Jewish state.  He shows how the British Empire tried to suppress the establishment of the new state of Israel, and how the Jews drove Great Britian out of Israel. He documents in horrific detail the life of an Israeli woman spy who was captured in Lebanon and tortured in prision, and then later miraculously released (my favorite episode).  Greenspan tells the story of the establishment of the nation of Israel in 1948, the 1956 war with Egypt and Syria, the 6-day war in 1967, and the surprise Yom Kippur war of 1973 where Israel was saved at the ""last hour"" by President Nixon's arms shipments.  All these wars stories are told from the perspective of certain individuals who encountered ""miracle"" conditions.

This is a compelling documentary.  It is very well-done, mixing documentary information with dramatic reenactments of historical events.  Greenspan does not directly answer his question of miracles, but leaves this up for the viewer to decide.

For anyone interested in the history of modern-day Israel, this is a most enlightening documentary that has faith implications as well as rich historical information.

I have enjoyed this series so very much, and have shared it with my friends.  I intend on using it for a future Sunday School Class, as I believe that God has been, and is continuing to, supernaturally intervene in the history and future of the country of Israel.

Highly recommended.

2615507,5,B000GNOGDI,"This has got to be one of the best documentaries ever made about Israel! It moved me through the spectrum of emotions, from tears to triumph and took my faith in God to ever deeper, stronger levels. Although I have read numerous ""religious"" accounts of overt supernatural intervention in Israel's modern history, it was thrilling to see a secular production handle this topic so fairly and honestly. The theme of this wonderful film might be: Friends of Israel, take heart; enemies of Israel, take note!",1165795200,35,503,4.929411764705883

2615510,5,B000GNOGDI,"Although this is not a religious film, it brings out how the Great Designer is in charge. Israel belongs to the Creator of the Universe and nothing will happen to her except what He desires that should work to bring her closer to Him. The miracles that He caused to save Israel and defeat her enemies are a foretaste of the coming war spoken of in Scripture when the whole world will be against this tiny nation left incapable of defending herself. At that point, when all hope is shattered and it looks as though Israel is toast, He will once again defend His people in a manner that the whole world will know that He exists and that Israel is His. You can't fight the Ruler of the Universe, you'll lose. But if you allow Him to come into your heart you will be on the winning side forever. This documentary points out that He is the Great Defender of His nation, always has been and always will be for those that graft in, Jew and Gentile, and are faithful.

2615517,5,B000GNOGDI,"The State of Israel  is a modern day miracle, flourishing and prosperous, having been  restored  in May 1948 as  ' in a day' out of the ashes of the Holocaust.
 If you ever doubted that the Hand of God orchestrated Israel's  extraordinary survival as a Nation  throughout  the traumatic times of the  Diaspora, culminating in the genocidal  atrocities of the  Holocaust, you will be marvellously  enlightened  by the events recorded in this  spectacular DVD Series.
  Israel is surrounded on all sides by hostile entities, intent on its annihilation,yet remains undefeatable.
  This remarkable  DVD Set reveals extraordinary accounts of Divine Intervention on Israel's behalf, during  all the major conflicts since the Jewish People returned  to the Covenanted Land.
 This honest, unbiased  production captures the awe and wonder of witnessing The Almighty at work,  as revealed through personal testimonies, including those of both  IDF and Enemy personnel.  You will not read these accounts in the media!!!

2615525,5,B000GNOGDI,"I Wanted to make sure and leave a recommendation for this series. I believe it was originally intended to be a multiple season series, and funding fell through, making this ""The complete series"" rather than ""The complete first season"". It's been several years since this came out, was shown on religious channels and offered through programs such as Jewish Voice Today with Jonathan Bernis. I purchased my copy after catching bits and pieces one day flipping channels and passing TBN (Trinity Broadcast Network) and INSP. I took my set with me when I moved overseas. I also shared it with my elders at my home congregation.

I fully believe that this series will make an awesome addition to any Christian church, or Messianic Jewish congregational library. If you can, show it as a weekly series in your congregation to explain how Israel became a nation again in one day, after all the atrocities and horrors of the Nazi era.

We cannot discount all the miracles that happened in the many wars of Israel's independence, and recapture of Jerusalem... G-d meant for this to happen again, to regather His people home.

I've shared my set a few times with friends and family, and have never regretted it. This fills in holes that much of American and European History glosses over, in favor of covering ""more important"" history in the region and at home during the time most of the series covers.",1337472000,3,1393,4.795833333333333
2615526,3,B000GNOGDI,"This is a very informative series which had been produced for TV. It is approached from an objective manner and is not overtly religious in view, even though there is the obvious perspective that devibe untervention occured in the forming and survival of the State of Israel - which I agree with.

2615528,5,B000GNOGDI,"These are great documentaries on miracles in Israel. Israel is the land God promised to the Jews around 3,000 years ago. These documentaries analyze the miracles that happened in Israel. For example, it talks about how Arab soldiers, who were fighting in the war to destroy Israel, yelled ""Ibrahim"" [Abraham] after they saw him appear in the sky. This is part of the evidence that God did help modern day Israel. In the second to last episode of these wonderful series, someone tells f how angels, who lit their swords, actually helped to protect Jews from Arab terrorists. The host of these series Michael Greenspan investigates miracles that have occurred in Israel. He talks to people, who experienced them. This documentary is a must see to anyone who wants to know God's role in helping Israel.",1277683200,6,799,4.882352941176471

2615531,5,B000GNOGDI,"An excellent and very encouraging series ! Thoroughly recommended to see the Hand of God working in Israel and the Jews.

If you want proof that God exists, then look at the Jews and the nation of Israel.
The Bible has predicted that the Jews would return to their land in preparation for the return of the Messiah (Ezekiel 37v21-28), after their nation was destroyed 2000 years ago. What other nation is like Israel ?

God has made Israel the only immortal nation, because God Himself is immortal.
""For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.""
Malachi 3v6

""For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations wither I have scateered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.""
Jeremiah 30v11",1272240000,9,851,4.407643312101911
2615532,5,B000GNOGDI,"There was a lot of repeating, so this must have been done for television originally, but other than that, it was really interesting, and we learned a lot that we did not know about Israels history. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind the bits of repetition",1265760000,9,279,4.6
2615533,5,B000GNOGDI,"Modern day Israel is truly a divine wonder of the current age. GOD, Faith and Miracles are the key to Israel's survival against all its enemies ever since the creation of the Jewish State of Israel 4000 year.

4000 years ago, the LORD, God of all creation established a Covenant with Abraham saying, ""I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."" Genesis 12:2-3.

I wish to thank Michael Grenspan for this wonderful DVD collection, and above all I thank the LORD, the God of the Hebrews for the Jewish State of Israel ""The land flowing with milk & honey, most beautiful of all lands."" Exodus 20:15.

The Word of the LORD says, ""For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with deep compassion I will bring you back."" Isaiah 54:7, ""He said to me, ""You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will display my splendor."" Isaiah 49:3, ""Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you (Israel) will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed,"" says the LORD, who has compassion on you. Isaiah 54:10.

If you wish to know more about the LORD's presence among His chosen people (The Jews), and if you are a Israeli lover, then this DVD collection is a must for your collection.

Whether you believe in God or not, the various conflicts since Israel's independence should have been won by the other nations - Israel being outnumbered, with less weapons, etc - but every time ""something"" happened that turned the tide of events in Israel's favour.

2615540,5,B000GNOGDI,"These are EXCELLENT videos, great for people who want to watch something entertaining, inspiring, moral, and devoid of all the garbage which is on television today.  I only wish there were a second season - I would buy all the episodes of this great series, in which miraculous events in Israel's past are brought to light.

However, a word of warning to Jewish viewers - you will have to tolerate some references to the Christian god - this movie series was made by Christians, not Jews, although many Israelis cooperated in making this series.  Overall, I would say the series is extremely respectful of Jewish heritage and history, but for those who are sensitive to Christian influence, be aware that there are a few references to Christianity in the films.",1234656000,8,761,4.838461538461538

My first and major gripe is that it repeats segments A LOT! There are about 6 DVDs, but if one were to delete the repeated segments, it would amount to about 2 DVDs of great video. I wish they had done just that. Buy it used or at discount and you'll get a great video set. Otherwise, I cannot justify the retail price for videos that repeat over and over again.

Also, the video's subtitle, ""The Complete First Season,"" makes it appear to be a drama. It's not; it's a documentary-style video.",1211846400,120,765,4.576642335766423

2615548,5,B000GNOGDI,"This is not fiction: one has to be reminded every now and then of this, because these stories are just unbelievable (if they weren't true).

13 episodes of 25 minutes plus an extra feature film. One would have wished each story had been developed more extensively. Each episode could well deserve more than an hour for us, people, to fully comprehend the amazing facts in the stories. There is an excess of emphasis, on the part of the narrator, on whether or not these are miracles; which I think detracts from the stories themselves. The stories of Israel's survival tell themselves.

I personally don't like reenactments and prefer to use my imagination fueled by a good narrator. I would have preferred a more quiet and deeper presentation of the facts, but we have to be thankful for whatever we have. CNN Investigator Michael Greenspan takes us through the stories by means of interviews with the very protagonists, and by reenactments.

In episode 1 tank commander David Yaniv ""recalls how he and his men were miraculously saved when a mysterious wind exposed thousands of explosives in the minefield in which they were stranded."" This one leaves you with your mouth open, speechless.

In episode 3 the investigator interviews 85-year-old Shula Cohen, who tell the story of how she became a spy for Israel. Her whole story is a series of miracle after miracle. The reenactment is alright, but if you were interviewing this lady you would have certainly asked her more questions. That only interview is worth a million dollars.

Episode 4: WWII & the Holocaust in 24 minutes... what a rush!

Episode 5: 1947, Israel in the making, and an interview with veteran freedom fighter Ezra Yakhin, another great testimony.",1176854400,70,1720,4.913793103448276
