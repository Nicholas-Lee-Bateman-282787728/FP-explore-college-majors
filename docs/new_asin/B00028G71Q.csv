8166557,1,B00028G71Q,"The Jim Bowie dvd is very disappointing. It is hardly visable. This item is not copied well. It is shadowed in darkness to the point that you can barely see the actors at all and forget about knowing what's happening. You truly must use your imagination. It seems that it is a good idea to rethink any purchase of the older movies if you do not have time and/or energy to get into a buy and return cycle (as I do not). In general, I have a shelf full of poor quality dvds that I waited too late to return because of my busy schedule. The question is, do you have that kind of time?",1298332800,,581,4.060869565217391
