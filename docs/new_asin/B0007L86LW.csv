2216793,1,B0007L86LW,"Don't be fooled, this is a cheap public domain copy of Beverly Hillbillies episodes; hence they do not contain the original music (Ballad of Jed Clampett, etc). and the sound and picture quality are abyssmal, not to mention the product stamp on every frame of the disc.  If you're a true affectionado of the Hillbillies try ""The Ultimate Collection"" discs as they were produced by the estate of Paul Henning the creator of the show.  Only the first two volumes have been released and hopefully a company will release genuine episodes as opposed to these public domain ripoffs.",1198800000,197,576,4.86734693877551

2216823,5,B0007L86LW,"This collection of 54 episodes is phenomenal. The Beverly Hillbillies is one of my favorite television shows. The Clampetts: Jed, Granny, Elly May, and Jethro Bodine are hillbillies who lack common sense when it comes to living in urban California. Some of the characters such as Milburn Drysdale, the president of the Commerce Bank and Jane Hathaway, his secretary, are hilarious.

It is entirely black & white, which I can deal with, but the quality of the cd's are very poor.  It's says that it has been digitally re-mastered and sound enhanced...BULL.  Who re-mastered it... Jethro?  They took out the original music that everyone who knows the show, loves to sing along.  Who made that decision...No really WHO?  I've never gotten a cd that has digitally re-mastered on it have such a bad picture.  Reminds me of when I was growing up at home and my parents had those damned rabbit ears on top of the TV.  When the reception was awful unless somebody was holding on to one or both ears.  I shouldn't be too hard on this review, after all the price was low and I've always said...Cheap aint good and good aint cheap.

2216916,3,B0007L86LW,"Like some of the other reviewers have noted all of these episodes are in the public domain. In fact I have them all on a collection of other sets and the quality is good considering. The most irksome part is the opening theme (as well as the closing) is replaced with some hokey sounding bluegrass music.

But for the price & the quality & number of episodes it's not bad. I just saw this same collection in a $5 bin at the local Wal-Mart so these copies are everywhere. In fact Bonanza has the same issue with around 30 episodes being in the public domain & offered on DVD but w/o the original opening theme.",1367712000,,609,4.2956521739130435

Just down right almost backwards,,,, hahahahahaha.  i sent these dvd's back for the fact that volume 1 & 2 had dvd's bouncing in the dvd cases when they arrived. i opened them up and they were scratched, in volume 2 when i checked the one floating around it was scratched and the secured one i also checked and that one was scratched, now i have no idea how that happened could have been the manufacturer or they sent me a used copy. never opened volume 3 so i just sent it back. I did try them out and they worked fine but it the principal of the thing don't send me something loose when you pick it up before mailing it.

2216958,5,B0007L86LW,"I love these endearing characters that are ignorant about living in the city and the ways of modern life.  The writing is excellent--using double meanings and idioms in a clever way.  My favorite character is cantankerous granny because she's not afraid to speak her mind.  She can also be sweet and lovable at times.  The idea for this story is imaginative--poor mountain folks that become rich overnight due to oil on their land.  Even though they're rich, living in a mansion, they keep their old way of life.  They do all of their housework, cooking, etc.  It's clean humor, good for the whole family.  I remember seeing it as a child at my grandparent's house.  Now that I'm an adult, I can understand all the jokes, so it's more enjoyable.
The only drawback is that they don't use the original theme music at the beginning and the end.  I did order 2 seasons on Amazon that have the original music.  However, not all of the seasons were available from that company.  I do recommend these for getting a lot of good quality episodes for a very low price.",1338595200,,1058,4.569148936170213
2216959,5,B0007L86LW,Very funny and fun to watch. My 10 and 12 year old boys love the shows and have been watching them non-stop.,1335312000,,108,3.9545454545454546
2216960,5,B0007L86LW,"I ordered this boxed set for my husband and my 10 year-old son who love watching the Beverly Hillbillies. Since the price was so low for 3 DVDs, our expectations weren't very high.  We all were very pleasantly surprised!  The picture and sound were fine!  My husband was disappointed that the actual opening theme song wasn't playing but I think it was because of a copyright issue.  The real disappointment is that they finished watching all the episodes tonight and there is not a 2nd boxed set available.  This show is a hoot.",1333411200,3,529,4.645161290322581
2216961,4,B0007L86LW,I love the episodes. I am not keen on the strange stuff they did to the intro to the episodes (the theme song) They colorized it--sort of (with color blocks not reality) and made the pictures look weird and distorted. Fortunately I can fast forward through the theme song. I would have been happier if they had left that alone. The episodes are not distorted and are loads of laughs. Total silliness and great fun.,1330992000,2,414,4.533333333333333
2216962,2,B0007L86LW,"Sad to say the pictures are rather blur.  Sound is ok.

2216976,5,B0007L86LW,Since Paramount for whatever reason doesnt officially release the first season or even the 4th season i guess 2 & 3 are better than nothing. If i was on a island & could only watch the BH or Andy Griffith i would choose the Hillbillies. This set doesnt have the original music to the opening credits but who cares. The quality isn't bad & i read the other choices is either you have to buy 2 sets to equal this one or buy a overpriced season 1 on dvd-r from Henning. I think this release is only missing one episode from season 1 which is the main reason to buy this set. Since im just a poor out of work buyer i chose this one instead of paying double to have season 1 elsewhere. Be nice if Paramount would release more official seasons but from what i have read it doesnt look like it anytime soon.,1307145600,14,800,4.134615384615385
2216977,4,B0007L86LW,"Well as I said, great for a budget DVD set...We have had a few other BEVERLY HILLBILLIES on budget DVD's before and this is about as good as your going to get in this price range...However, they do leave out the original famous intro song...
But I understand that might have been part of some type *Legal Agreement* to release as a budget set........BOB",1299715200,5,353,4.53125
2216978,4,B0007L86LW,Good product I thought I was getting all the episodes in the series but it is selected episodes. I was particularly after episodes with Earl Scruggs and Lester Flatt. These episodes are not in this collection.,1287273600,17,209,4.833333333333333
2216979,4,B0007L86LW,Product was delivered as promised in a timely manner.  Great episodes I've never seen before.  The only thing I don't like about this product is that the original Beverly Hillbillies theme song is missing.  There is just bluegrass music playing instead of the original Flatt & Scruggs theme.,1281484800,35,291,5.020833333333333
2216980,5,B0007L86LW,"I still enjoy humour from 50's, 60's and 70's. You don't need truckloads of blood, guts and sex with the camera aimed in the topic's face. Different friends that I have spoken to about the Hillbillies remember them with fond memories. I enjoyed the DVD greatly. The only small disappointment is that it does not play the original theme tune with the song about Jed hunting for food and shooting and "" -- out of the ground comes bubbling crude, oil that is, Texas T"". Some of the scenes are a bit washed out and the sound level drops a bit but overall I enjoyed a trip back into a happier world.",1275696000,25,594,4.3125

The quality of these episodes is good. Occasionally the picture is slightly blurry, but not enough to be bothersome; and I noticed this only once or twice, not throughout the whole set.

8047992,4,B0007L86LW,"First of all, I really enjoy watching these videos.  However,  I was a bit put off by the scrambled order of the episodes.  I would watch one episode that didn't seem to correctly follow the one before, and then two episodes later appeared the ones that should have preceded the one I watch three episodes earlier.  There is even a repeat of at least one of the episodes on the last DVD in the set.  Guess I can't really complain considering the low price, but it doesn't seem like putting the episodes in the correct order on the DVDs should be a big deal.  Still, it was all good to watch, and I laughed so much that it almost made up for the crazy order the episodes were placed.",1491177600,,682,4.248062015503876
