5115478,5,B007ZXVOZ0,"My daughter loves this! I thought she wouldn't like it because the rudimentary animation but she demanded to watch it over and over , the first day she watched it 5 times & went straight to the bathroom pulled down her pull-ups and hopes on her potty chair! She has been a very hard kid to potty train and has resisted every method we have tried so out of frustration we looked for a DVD to help and because of the reviews we picked this one and are so glad we did. This is excellent!",1405641600,,484,4.105263157894737

5115480,1,B007ZXVOZ0,"Let me start by saying I am a HUGE fan of Potty Power. It is magical and it helped me potty train my two oldest children, now 8 and 5. I have recommended it to countless others and loaned my old DVD out when not in use to at least a dozen other families. Now my third child is ready and I just ordered this because I couldn't find my original one.  The ""Princess"" version is no where near as strong as the original. In the original, you have a hostess/storyteller, ""Jessica,"" who stands in front of the camera and speaks directly to the children and makes eye contact with them. There are also a ton of live action scenes and very catchy tunes. My two oldest kids were mesmerized by the format and would say ""Again!"" over and over and they watched it many times in a row.  I was mislead by the pink ""Princess"" cover and I incorrectly assumed it would be the same format with just a lot of pink and princess type decor and costuming. Instead, it has this very simplistic animation throughout with a smattering of live action. The cute girls dressed in tutus and princess-wear on the cover never appear in the video. The kids in the ""Potty Power Princess"" live action scenes are wearing regular clothes and they have cheap plastic and feather crowns on. The songs are even made to be less fun with garbled lyrics..too much for little ones. The voice of the main cartoon character's voice sounds totally annoying like an adult trying to sound like a little kid. And why on earth do the cartoon characters have to blink their eyes so much??? Very creepy and distracting.  What a bummer. The abundance of live action, speaking directly to the camera, and those powerful catchy songs is what is so special about the original. The best parts of ""Princess"" were the recycled scenes from the original version. I really hope this change in format was not the result of some frivolous lawsuit that forced them to produce it this way b/c that would be a real shame. One more thought on the animation....my third child is growing up in 2013 watching high-definition blue ray animation DVD's and this cartoon version of Potty Power just does not keep her attention. I'll be searching for my original Potty Power DVD or buying another new one soon.",1358812800,26,2233,4.522277227722772
5115481,5,B007ZXVOZ0,"My Daughter loves this DVD and runs around saying Potty Power...even though this movie could not even coax her in to using the potty. I do not think its the movies fault, I just think she is a little immature for her age.",1356480000,,221,4.162790697674419
5115482,4,B007ZXVOZ0,"My daughter likes watching this DVD every now and then. She loves hearing that she's a potty princess every time she goes potty in the toilet. The DVD isn't magic, I still have to do a lot of reminding and telling her to get on the potty when she squats. My daughter's situation was a little different though because we lost our home in the middle of her potty training to a tornado and she went through some behavior and emotional changes, so not exactly a cut and dry situation. I wish the DVD was only about potty training vs. washing hands, wiping, etc. she has no problem with those. My daughter is 2 1/2.",1355184000,,610,4.3130434782608695
5115483,5,B007ZXVOZ0,"This was a huge hit for our potty training efforts. My daughter has picked up so many good tips from this.  She now sings ""twinkle twinkle little star"" every time she washes her hands. It really made her want to use the potty too. She proudly says ""I'm a potty princess!"" and ""diapers are for babies, not for princesses like me!"".  She loves doing the potty princess dance.  This video made such a difference!",1339718400,5,409,4.5

8523492,3,B007ZXVOZ0,It was cute but it didn't really work on my princess. It doesn't really talk about washing your hands or the process. Its just a story.,1481673600,,135,4.230769230769231

8523495,2,B007ZXVOZ0,The original Potty Power was far better. Our granddaughter would watch the original with Jessica on constantly. She watched this one for 5 minutes and walked away.,1448323200,4,163,5.074074074074074
