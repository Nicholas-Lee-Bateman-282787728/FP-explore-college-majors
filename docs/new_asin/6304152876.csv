793832,4,6304152876,"It has been called,the 'last great cavalry charge in history,' and this film, like the famous charge at Beersheba on 31 October 1917, is an epic event that relates the courage of the Australian 'digger' (soldier).
In fact the charge was not carried out by cavalry but instead by mounted infantry (who do not have sabres) and also the Poles would dispute the claim  because their cavalry charged the tanks of the Wermacht in the 1939 conflict which ushered in the second great global conflagration.
The authentic nature of the film is highlighted not only in the classic charge but in small details such as the map in the Turkish commander's office being in Arabic-which was the alphabet the Turks were using in World War 1.
'Lighthorsemen,' like two other Aussie war films, made in the 1980s, (Breaker Morant and Gallipoli) reflected some antagonisms that existed between Australian and British troops, and which have been heightened by film makers of the modern generation. Fortunately, this is not over-played in this fine film and when it does surface it is obvious that the astute British intelligence officer, Major Meinertzhagen ( played superbly by Anthony Andrews), deliberately wants to foster such feelings as part of his plans of deception against the Turks. The real-life importance of a letter from a female army nurse, in an attempt to deceive the Turks into withdrawing a division from Beersheba to Gaza, is also highlighted by a fine piece of acting between Andrews and Sigrid Thornton.
 The ride into hostile territory by the bird-loving Meinertzhagen and an Aussie soldier is a interesting sub-plot and will give American viewers some indication of the cultural differences between egalitarian Australia and the class society of Britain.
Perhaps it is also worth noting that the appointment of Australia's Lt. Gen. Sir Harry Chauvel as commander of the Desert Corps, was derisively greeted by one British brigadier with the words,  "" fancy giving command of the biggest mounted force in history to an Australian."" Fancy that!
(Fortunately such views were not held by the two British commander-in-chiefs, Murray and, his replacement, Allenby).
Maybe that explains why, when Chauvel was faced with a choice between assigning British cavalry (under Fitzgerald) or the Australian mounted infantry ( under Grant), to lead the momentous charge on Beersheba, he quietly said to Gen. Hodgson, ""put Grant straight at it.""
The stage was then set for one of the most dramatic rides in history and this film captures the lighthorsemens ride into the pages of history.
FOOTNOTE: Chauvel's two boyhood heroes were Saladin and JEB Stuart. Like the great Islamic leader of the Crusades the Australian leader would strike hard at tired and isolated armies and also like the great Confederate cavalry leader, Chauvel's armies covered great distances-in 1918 he isolated 2 Turkish armies after travelling 640kms in 12 days. Chauvel referred to it as his ""Jeb Stuart ride.""",1007424000,71,2971,5.146997929606625
793833,5,6304152876,"A brilliantly crafted war film with a different feel than most.  It is one of the only military films I know to have an authentic, believable romantic side plot that doesn't compromise the plot.  The characters, especially those of the apparently bungling but in fact clever and admirable intelligence officer, and the boy who, though patriotic, cannot kill even to defend himself (but even so becomes a combat medic) are compelling indeed. The cavalry, err, mounted-infantry charge at the end of the film has to be one of the most amazing horse cinematic feats ever put of film",994723200,6,578,4.887755102040816

The 'quality' is one part--the story content and how its presented is another. The story of ""The Lighthorsemen"" tells the tale of mounted infantry used during WWI. 80% of the film tho is about the personal relationship between half a dozen Lighthorsemen and a romantic story gets thrown in as well. And that 80% is just...'ok' and it could have been shortened and had no negative effect on the film. The final 20% of the movie, which is the charge of The Lighthorseman against a fixed position of Turks, and Germans is exciting, heroic, beautifully filmed and makes for a satisfying ending. It's also a bonus that at the end of the film we get to read about what became of the main characters later in life validating that these were very much real people who lived during a time of War and were heroic.",1509667200,,1002,4.572222222222222

The real beauty of knowing the history of the Light Horse taking Beersheba adds to knowledge of the Holy that within a generation, the Remnant of Israel returned to the promised land and made it fruitful and beautiful again.

794005,5,6304152876,"A brilliant movie. In this, the 100th anniversary of the historic cavalry charge, this movie shines the light of glory on the brave men of the Australian Light Horse. One of the most realistic and best WW1 movies out there. The characters are real and you get the raw, gritty nature of war and war in the desert. There is heartfelt romance and there is bravery and conscience. This movie so aptly presents the 'fog of war' which occurs in every battle but is hard to convey. A battle plan only works until the first shot is fired then it is all up to luck, bravery and skill.

We were prepared for 'subtitles' but instead found a brilliant director's cut with additional scenes not found in the original 1980's release that I had owned on VHS. A brilliant movie and a must own for any fan of military history or fans of action movies with romance.

This review of The Lighthorsemen 2013 Australian Blu-ray release by Umbrella Entertainment is primarily regarding the image quality since others have already commented on the story and often have been critical of the image quality of previous import DVD releases.  This Blu-ray release of the 1987 film looks absolutely gorgeous in a crisp and pristine print, completely free of any blemishes and with beautifully saturated colors, as if it were filmed yesterday.  It is presented in it's correct 2.35:1 aspect which is used by Australian film-maker Simon Wincer to advantage and to frame the terrific cinematography by award winner Dean Semler.  It tells the WW-1 story of British actions against the Turks and Germans in 1917 Palestine to capture Beersheeba.  The unspoiled landscape, here with Victoria and South Australia substituting for Palestine, is a prominent element of the film.  Many wide shots also convey the large scale of horse-mounted military operations, with real riders and horses, no CGI here.  Contrasting with the sweeping landscapes, the film offers many close-ups of the men and horses to enrich the visuals.  Don't bother with the cheap poor-quality copies that are criticized in other reviews.  It's worth the cost to buy this Blu-ray edition to see the glory of this great Australian film as it deserves to be seen.  It is a welcome addition to any film library of work by the great director Simon Wincer.  This a Region-free A/B/C disk so it plays on US players.  It runs 116 minutes, is Dolby 2.0 sound, and does not have subtitles.  The only extra is a Simon Wincer commentary.",1451606400,14,1647,5.03690036900369

794770,4,6304152876,"This wasn't a great film. Clearly it was trying to be, but somewhere along the way they forgot to figure out what they were trying to say. Is it an anti-war film? Is it pro-war? Is it about man's inhumanity to man? Is it just supposed to be good fun? Having the answer to all that be ambiguous might make it seem like this film is taking a more realistic approach but it doesn't feel realistic, just lazy. I honestly don't think they ever thought about what kind of message they were trying to convey. And that's why despite having a few decent battle scenes and an interesting setting it never really seems to catch your attention.

The plot of the film is pretty basic. The Aussie light horse is in Palestine fighting the Turks. Sooner or later there's going to be a major cavalry charge, but there's no real anticipation for it. Most of the film is the soldiers dealing with each other, engaging in minor skirmishes, and other stereotypical soldier stuff. There's also the painfully stereotypical nurse love interest, who falls for the hero instantly despite not knowing him and having hundreds of other soldiers to choose from. Most of the rest of the incidents, while generic war film tropes, work significantly better. There's a soldier who isn't able to kill people who's crisis is generally handled well. The new guy introduced into the tried and tested unit is another. The film is taken up with these and there are more hits than misses in this regard. The big battle at the end of the film is the battle of Beersheba, the last successful cavalry charge. A subject like this seems perfect for a gung-ho war film about the high point of the ANZAC cavalry forces to counter the anti-war approach of Gallipoli, but as I said before the film never really settles on what it wants to say.

One nice thing about it is the relatively low amount of Pommy-bashing. There is a bit of conflict with the obligatory stiff-necked and humorless British officer, but they also feature a scene where the British soldiers cheer the Aussies on to the embarrassment of the men who are looking for a fight. Furthermore my favorite character in the film is a British intelligence officer. He's every bit the cold and aloof officer you'd expect, but he's smarter than the rest and actually plays up the Aussie perceptions of him to good effect in one hilarious scene. The rest of the characters are somewhat hard to distinguish so this man stands out the more.

A few more minor problems with this film: the scenery which is supposed to be in Israel is really obviously southern Australia. All deserts do not look alike, and Beersheba isn't nearly as deserty looking as they seem to think. The other minor problem that occasionally becomes a major problem is the choice of how to portray the enemy. Both the Turks and the Germans speak perfect English. Since this is World War I and the uniforms aren't as distinctive or imprinted in common memory this occasionally makes it difficult to tell which guys are the good guys. Especially when they're not facing the camera. They don't have many scenes, but that just makes it harder to tell when the film has switched focus to the villains. Also, the final charge goes on forever. I was reminded of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when Lancelot keeps running up the hill never getting closer.

Overall not a bad film. I know I've gone on about the negative points, but that's just because they are the most notable things about this movie and some of them would be so easy to fix. Most of the film is decent enough. Certainly it's worth watching if you're interested in the time or just like war films or Aussie movies in general. I certainly can't think of another film that spends so long with the cavalry. Just don't go in expecting a masterpiece.",1407369600,,3783,4.616641901931649

This is a great movie and i can't believe no one has made a legal version of it on dvd. There is obviously a criminal enterprise behind the creation of this dvd and i am sorry i didn't look at the reviews before buying it. I hate to support criminals. I will say one thing about the quality that actually was a bit fascinating to me. I watch a lot of anime dvd and there are times when i am sure the subtitles are a bit off. What they say in english doesn't seem to be what is shown on the screen. I know it happens but usually they do a decent enough job that i can enjoy the anime anyway. Watching this travesty in english subtitles was at least as entertaining as the film. WHY would i watch it in subtitles you ask? Because you have NO choice. There is no selection that allows you to watch it without subtitles. I have never seen a dvd that did that. Yet another clue as to how lazy the creation was. And if that wasn't bad enough what they write in the subtitles is horrible. It makes zero sense compared to what they are actually saying. Well at least if i am forced to watch in subtitles i found it amusing fore the first half hour before i found being forced to ignore them too much of a pain. I doubt i will watch this again. Save your money and don't ever support these lazy criminals.,1390435200,5,1396,4.061594202898551

That release was in 2.35 wide screen and 131 minutes. Subsequent DVD releases in Australia have been disappointing, being either cut in length or cut in aspect ratio. This Blu-ray release has the original wide screen aspect ratio but some 14 minutes have been taken out in 13 mini cuts here and there for no obvious reason and no benefit at all. Why on earth would someone go to such trouble and ruin one of the best war films ever made in Australia? None of the releases have subtitles for the hearing impaired and in this day and age that is inexcusable. The picture quality is better than the DVD of this release but not by a lot. The sound is OK but obviously no surround effects. Becker did a DVD in Australia with the right length and a surround re-mix that sounded good but wrecked their effort by trimming it to 1.78!
On balance this is the best you can get today but if they had only left the full film alone and added subtitles it would have been really good. Great shame.

  I have seen many of these types of movies in Korea, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan.  Typically for this type of version (Quality) overseas Soldiers would actually pay approximately $1.00 or a little more (no more than $1.50) for their personal use and definately wouldn't sell it to another.  These movies are typically left for the next unit's enjoyment (free of charge).
  Be very wary of what you purchase. $10.99 is way too much for this type of a cheap copy, to include the amount of time to receive (purchased on 05-Aug-2011...received on 06-Sep-2011). I was taken and it's my mistake for not paying more attention.  Lucky for me it was just a video.

Honestly, I have authored much better DVDs of this movie from the three VHS copies I have, using a Sony VCR and a Leadtek video capture card.  For one thing, there is a tendency towards red in virtually all scenes.  The saturation is too high and the hue needs to be adjusted.  The aspect ratio is also not quite right, probably because it was converted from PAL.  The DVD DOES function correctly, though.

Personally, I would have obtained one of the widescreen laserdiscs and made a DVD from that.  The quality on the LD is pretty good and this movie really demands widescreen treatment.

It's not a great film by a long shot, but it is extremely well directed by Simon Wincer in the days when he was the go-to guy for anything with horses, extremely well edited and quite beautifully photographed by Dean Semler in vivid colour. Retelling the Australian Light Horse's famous charge on Beersheba in WW1, the subject of the earlier and generally superior propaganda picture 40,000 Horsemen, it desperately wants to be another Gallipoli, but despite lavish production values is let down by a script that covers the history well enough but doesn't give us particularly well-drawn characters to care about - the mates the film focuses on may well be based on real people, but they play as pure stereotypes. As a result there's not much emotional pull. Indeed, the most touching scene is when Sigrid Thornton fakes a letter to a non-existent soldier to add a touch of credibility to some false documents to be 'captured' by the Turks. However, the pre-CGI carnage of the final charge is genuinely impressive stuff and well worth waiting for.

Well one immediate clue was the inclusion of the lady's name on the complete film credits found on <[...] who played Dave's Mother. After the scene of Dave at the station talking to the sgt on the trainload of horses & then unsaddling, jumping the gate & riding home, we lose the entire scene at the supper table when his mother, mute, worries about his joining up & his father says ""If he wants to join, we can't stop him"". A photo of his dead brother already kiled in action is in the backgound, but we don't know of this until later when the group are talking after tucker & Taz upsets Dave not knowing the brother is dead. Another important spot is just as the regiment is moving out, prior to the patrol when Frank gets shot, a Bedouin spy watches them ride off! Later still before the big push, Taz is writing a belated letter home to his wife & Chiller comes over to ask what his mate is doing? Taz is short with him & he backs off. This is perhaps our first intimation that Taz is at risk? The scene that follows when the postal orderly refuses to take Taz's letter & Chiller obliges, thus getting back in his good books I think WAS included in the US cut, now not too well understood due to the early part being missing. I need to run both versions side by side & compare them to be sure that the ultimate charge was not emasculated perhaps for US viewers as being too graphic??? There are some great horse falls & stunt riders' ""deaths"" falling out of the saddle at full gallop! One man has his bandolier of ammunition across his chest explode when hit by a Turkish machine gun bullet. In the fierce hand to hand trench fighting there's a Turk getting his throat cut by bayonet, others on both sides being bayoneted in the belly, the one horse seen being blown up in mid air was a rubber dummy. Suntmen even rode this for some shots I understand. When Simon Wincer reused the climactic charge in the ""Young Indiana Jones"" tv episode ""Daredevils of the Desert"", in the end credits poor Jon Blake was given a stunt credit for the fall he seemed to make when the nearby well blew up in Beersheba just before he found the wiring. It wasn't him! It was the lead stunter on the film. Of interest was the late eldest daughter of General Sir Harry Chauvel, who was both a well-known Australian writer of childrens' books & a wonderful rancher up into her eighties, loaned a copy of her fine book on the Light Horse to Wincer when he was preparing the film. The opening sequence of the horse round-up was shot on her family property with its magnificent scenery. In fact Wincer's much earlier film ""PHAR LAP"" was filmed on a race track adjacent to that property! I'm hoping he may be able to engineer a new DVD release of that classic racing film at least Down Under, as he has recently done with a much improved new DVD version there of ""The Man from Snowy River"", which he produced. Both his ""The Lighthorsemen"" & ""Quigley Down Under"" starring Tom Selleck seem currently to be undergoing a huge renewal of interest on the part of viewers in North America. Nobody can overlook his immense success either with the ""Lonesome Dove"" Us mini=-series or the two Selleck westerns. sincerely, John.",1085184000,12,3311,4.4295081967213115
