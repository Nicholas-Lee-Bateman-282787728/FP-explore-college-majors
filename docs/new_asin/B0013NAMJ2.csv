If I read a book then see the movie I usually like the book way more, however this is a case that I would have to say I can't decide which is better...the book or movie. I would say you can't go wrong with the movie or book.",1216944000,2,245,3.823529411764706

Then one day I asked about it and they said they didn't have it anymore.  Well, Amazon did, so I bought it and I loved it.  Now I can watch it anytime I want.",1210291200,2,296,3.6507936507936507
