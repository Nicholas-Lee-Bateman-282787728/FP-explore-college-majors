8598983,4,B00DY6GMHW,"I wanted to buy this as my cousin was in the 80th and was pleasantly surprised to see a few of the story boards, at the beginning of some segments to indicate the men were of the 318th Inf Regt. The video on is simply the archival images taken by the combat cameramen assigned to the units. There is no sound or over laying dialog. I gave it four stars as it only includes the time frame August to November 1944, I'm sure more film exist and wanted to see the  time period of Dec to the end of the war. At present I can't see where they have any disc dedicated to that period and only covering the 80th. To family members of 80th members specifically the 318th and 317th Infantry regiments they will find it interesting but again it is not all inclusive of the combat time and areas during which  the 80th served.",1427587200,,813,4.205128205128205
