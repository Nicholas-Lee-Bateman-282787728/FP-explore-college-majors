1793598,2,B00006SKVU,"It's terrible to see something so painstakingly beautiful yet so dramatically inert.  Musically there is much to enjoy.  Visually, as lovely as the costumes, settings, etc. are, I found this Orfeo to be a crashing bore.

Mr. Zanasi's Orfeo, while at times beautifully sung, is almost comical, looking more like a plump, Spanish businessman at a costume party and his acting is close to nil.

Trish Brown's stunning, minimalist production of Orfeo with the simply amazing Simon Keenlyside dancing and singing the title role with Brown's dance company was shown throughout Europe on television (and available on inferior quality pirate DVD), is far and away more moving, equally musical (Rene Jacobs and an early music ensemble) and would be a better choice for DVD release than this production.

Very disappointing.",1093305600,,814,5.230769230769231

A real relief of a DVD as so many operas being performed today try to modernize the setting and costumes (turning the opera into a grotesque spectacle that is unbearable to watch).
  This DVD has good bonus features, too. Highly recommended!",1084147200,,349,4.8
1793601,4,B00006SKVU,"A beautiful production! But let us not forget that Opera is theatre and not just singing. The sound is magnificent and the tableaux are breathtaking but the drama is lacking. I can't help but compare it to Ponnelle's film from the 70s. [I wish it were out on DVD!] That was even MORE baroque in its look but there was action, where there needed to be, and people standing there singing, where that needed to be [Ponnelle was a master at this]
But, since this is my favorite opera [well actually ""Le Nozzi"" is my fave....this is 2nd] I am delighted to have a beautiful, rich and excellently sung version even if they do just stand there.",1060387200,,636,4.444444444444445
1793602,5,B00006SKVU,This is a wonderful production of an early Baroque opera.  It's performed on period instruments (by costumed musicians) and the singing is very good.

1793603,4,B00006SKVU,"Barcelona Gran Liceu's audience beheld a lavish Orfeo
production by Gilbert Deflo and his sensitive partner
William Orlandi;beautiful settings,lighting,mirrors,
Monteverdi dresses to Savall and his musicians and so on.
However,to the music...Zanasi's pleasant timbre,steady
performance lacks passion and testosterona;maybe Orfeo
had some sexual disturbance in this production(well,he
is a demi-god)but Zanasi sings a beautiful ""Possente
Spirto"" and the whole act five,anyway. Sumptuous voices
shined on stage;what a perfect Apollo by Fulvio Bettini,
Sara Mingardo and that excellent Proserpina by Adriana
Fernandez who can touches all hellish forces better than
Orfeo himself! A huge mistake on booklet(unbelievable this
sort of things nowadays);brazilian soprano Marlia Vargas
was Ninfa,not Eco! Turk is the best sheppard in the ensemble
but Carlos Mena is a so feeble countertenor that he endangers
the trio. I'm sorry,I just can't help to warn you;Figueras is
the worse Musica I ever heard. Her ragged voice,that dragged
tempo,obviously to stay a bit more on stage just slew all beauties on overture. Musicians are among the best in the world,
including superstar Andrew Lawrence King on the double harp;
each one of them get involved at the most superior way with Monteverdi masterpiece. You'll disagree some ""tempo"" by Savall just like I do,probably;slowly and slowly again. So,listen my advice;this is a very fine DVD;skip Figueras and enjoy Orfeo!",1054771200,,1454,5.7050691244239635
1793604,4,B00006SKVU,"Savall may be today's grand guru of the ""historically aware"" musical production scene, and conducts here a recent, indeed sumptuous production of this masterwork from Barcelona's Liceo opera house. The theatre was ravaged by a fire some years ago  and has been recontructed magnificently. Savall makes use of his catalonian forces one frequently encounters in his recordings and they rise magnificently to the occasion, producing a scholarly and thoroughly convincing, from the philological perspective, rendering. His singers are a varied lot. Montserrat Figueras, Mrs Savall in real life, opens up the proceedings as a very convincing La Musica, if somewhat over-acted. The Orfeo, a singer I face up for the first time (Furio Zanasi), gives a beatifully vocalised Orfeo that is utterly wanting on the acting side, apparently being more concerned with an impeccable mastering of the work's vocal intricacies than in projecting his character on stage in a convincing manner; the ""possente spirto"" passage is precious, though. The Euridice is given nepotically to Savall and Figueras's young daughter Arianna, who is not very convincing as the unfortunate girl that prompts Orfeo's rescue excursion into hell. She has a likeable voice but has still to develop her skills; in my view, there are in the market far better candidates for the rle Savall might have chosen. The jewel in the crown is the Messenger, soprano Sara Mingardo, ravishingly poignant when bringing the news of Euridice's death, her voice soaring all over the vast venue and superbly acted. The supporting rles are well cast and sung, and the Act 1 dancers do their fare effectively. The production by flemish rgisseur Gilbert Deflo is, as I said in the introductory sentences, luxurious and all-encompassing and resembles a similar one that Spanish TV (TVE) broadcast by satellite to the world in 2000 from Madrid's Royal Theatre that I don't recall if is also his; in Barcelona it surprises you from its very beginning as Savall's enters from the back of the stalls, period-dressed and deliberately walking towards the pit to impetuously launch the proceedings, with musicians in charge of the famous opening fanfare distributed in various places in the hall and balconies.
Sound quality has the spectacularity one has grown to expect from this source.",1054080000,,2321,5.239247311827957

The singing is impeccable, though I would've preferred more extensive ornamenting by the soloists, the musicians are absolutely magnificent, and the visual effects are also stunning!  A collaboration like this with so many world class musicians does not happen all the time.  I recommend this for anyone who complains that baroque opera is boring or stale.",1046995200,,443,5.027397260273973
1793606,5,B00006SKVU,"Jordi Savall is well known in early music circles for combining sound scholarship with high creativity, and this production of L'Orfeo is an example of Savall at his best. The sets and costumes evoke Monteverdi's era well, the choreography is based on the art of the time, and the singing and playing are magnificent. One might have liked a little more dashing Orfeo, but overall this is a refreshing change from the self-indulgent postmodern reinterpretations of Baroque operas one often sees.

7973193,5,B00006SKVU,"Jordi, Monserrat, & their catalunya all-stars bring us another pinnacle performance in Barcelona's glittering teatro Liceu.

I think I first heard this band in a recording of various settings of the venerable Song of the sybil, recorded for Harmonia Mundi in the late seventies. It struck a nice compromise between primitive plainsong, faux bourdon, & full bombast that left this auditor somewhat weary of the repetition. Overall its energy & enthusiasm encouraged further listening.

Now Signor Monterverdi's Orfeo is a much bigger challenge, & I think they meet it admirably. The band is brisk, bright, subtle as needs be, & technique generally tempers enthusiasm to produce a warm, measured balance between forces. Performers are paired so that one can distract from the occasional shortcomings of the other. The audience appears engaged. Mr Savall keeps his band on-tempo throughout, & they seem to be enjoying the experience - always a good sign. STage direction relies a bit too much on operatic posturing, for my tastes.

I was saddened to see Ms Figueras died shortly after making this DVD. Her Musica reminds us old fans of the soul, warmth & dark resonance she brought to the repertoire. I'll miss her a lot.",1392336000,,1218,5.08

This review is correctly listed under the Savall production but has also been listed recently and wrongly under the Netherland's production. This is a common problem with listing and is beyond reviewers' control. Please be patient and understanding and scroll down to your choice. You may even find this review useful as a comparison!  Thanks - Ian Giles
............................................

This production and recording, made in 2002 at Barcelona's Liceu Theatre with Savall is a total triumph of imagination and musicality combined. It also benefits from a very fine visual and sonic recording for its period (2002).

The production is presented using an orchestra made up of the instruments that would have been familiar and accessible to Monteverdi. The orchestra is large but is mainly deployed for the sheer variety of sounds that can be created from such a selection rather than the effect of all playing at once. The opening flourishes on brass, cornetts and percussion played from the balcony as the conductor, Jordi Savall, makes his entrance from the rear of the theatre is immediately arresting. A similarly effective, but far less grand, entrance is also made upon the announcement of Euridice's death. These two moments illustrate the telling use of space in this production to create strong changes of mood with the minimum of props. Indeed the production succeeds to an amazing extent to establish the joy of Orfeo's relationship with his new wife, which is then contrasted with devastating sadness at her death. There follows the descent to and return from the kingdom of death and Orfeo's anguish at losing Euridice once more. The opera manages to turn this appalling situation round to one of general rejoicing as Orfeo chooses to join his wife among the celestial bodies with his own early death.

None of this would work of course if the musical values were not of the highest order. In this production the musicianship displayed by the whole cast is simply beyond reproach. One has to mention the superb characterisation of Orfeo as portrayed by Furio Zanasi whose acting is an object lesson in continuous expression coupled with fine singing throughout. Much the same can be said of all the supporting thirteen members the singing cast. It is inappropriate to list them all individually here with a separate comment for each but suffice it to say that is would be difficult to imagine a more perfect delivery by each individual member either singly or in ensemble.

The orchestra plays superbly with total mastery over the instruments of the period and is led with great authority, sensitivity and energy by Jordi Savall.

The camera work is crisp and fully involving and delivers good colour resolution. The excellent sound is presented in DTS surround and stereo options.

The bonus features include the usual illustrated synopsis and cast gallery typical of this label plus a 16 minute documentary where Gilbert Deflo, stage director, explains the ideas behind the staging of this production and recorded in Mantua's Palazzo Ducale.

This is an exceptional production with equally exceptional musical values and granted a high quality visual and sonic recording which was equally exceptional in 2002. On that basis it seems very likely that this disc will give considerable satisfaction to future purchasers and should therefore be rated as a clear 5 star issue.",1349222400,,3407,5.1482820976491865
7973195,5,B00006SKVU,"I really love this version of the Orfeo: philologically admirable for both the instrumental organic and the singing technique, which I prefer from the Harnoncourt's one.
Perhaps may be criticized for the spectacular choices, but overall is very apprecciable product.",1297987200,,266,5.675
7973196,5,B00006SKVU,"This production of L' Orfeo by Claudio Montverdi is absolutely remarkable in every way. Jordi savall has surpassed himself, and so too the stage production manager, Gilbert Deflo. This period piece is perfectly suited not only Jordi Savall and his orchestra, Les Concert des Nations La Capella Reial de Catalunya, but also to Barcelona's magnificent Gran Teatre del Liceu. The Opera's opening scenes are nothing less than pure grace, both to see and to hear.
The music is so sensitively conducted and played that it defy's the senses and one is transported immediately into a state of aural euphoria. This is a must have for admirers of period productions, it is utterly brilliant!

7973197,5,B00006SKVU,"This is a beautiful 5-star DVD. That said...
Jordi Savall always works with the the very best of people for his productions (except for a dynasty part for daughter Arianna here!) although they seem to form a klan. I would like to refer the readers of the review to the magnificent spanish baroque music CDs with him a conductor, many with haunting features which sound best on DTS, (but even with a good audio system). That period instruments  can grace the modern theater with aplomb is very welcome. I look forward to another opera on DVD by Savall and his folks.",1204416000,,565,4.594059405940594
7973198,4,B00006SKVU,"Es una buena puesta. Me agrad la ambientacin cual si fuera el estreno en el Palacio Ducal en Mantua. Y estoy de acuerdo con quien dijo que el estilo de la escenografa podra ser el mismo que el utilizado en la poca de Monteverdi.

Particularmente las voces me parecieron sencillas, sin mucho trabajo en el timbre en comparacin con las exigencias que presenta, por ejemplo, Haendel en sus peras. He escuchado versiones de L'Orfeo en donde las voces tienen un timbre ms brillante que esta versin pero eso no desmerita a sta pues vale la pena el trabajo de los artistas en cuanto a la actuacin.

La escena mejor lograda fue la de Caronte. La mscara que utiliz el cantante est muy buena, con mucha expresin, y el ambiente de la laguna Estigia me pareci magnfico.

Musicalmente la orquesta cumple. El sonido es excelente. Quizs muchos no estn de acuerdo con que la orquesta haya sido filmada todo el tiempo pero es necesario considerar que la puesta considera el ambiente de un palacio y, por lo tanto, la orquesta forma parte de la tragedia misma, donde la misma Msica se involucra desde el principio.

Pero no estoy de acuerdo con algo. Me hubiera gustado mucho ver la pera con subttulos en espaol, en especial cuando se trata de una puesta del Teatro del Liceo. Es bueno tener DVD's de peras con subttulos en varios idiomas, entre ellos el espaol, muy desprestigiado a pesar de de haber una gran mayora de hispanohablantes en el continente americano.

Sonido e imagen muy buenos.

7973199,5,B00006SKVU,"This is one of the best productions of a Monteverdi opera I've seen on DVD.

The cast is very good. Although I was surprised to see a baritone singing the role of Orfeo. However, he does a fine job and the tessitura of the role would hole no terrors for most baritones.

The dancing in the first act is entertaining and very pretty.

The costumes are not ""period"" but sort of ""ancient"". The staging is the same.

A nice touch to have Jordi Savall dressed as Monteverdi, himself!

The talk on the opera in the bonus material is one of the best I've seen on an opera, too. The overall presentation of the CD and the material is very classy and exhibits a great love of and respect for the opera and the composer.

I will buy another DVD recording of this work, however, I am very pleased and satisfied with this one until I do.

The two cornett players are very good and clearly visible.",1156118400,,885,4.295180722891566
7973200,5,B00006SKVU,"I see that the opinions vary on this production. I must wholeheartedly and enthusiastically endorse this edition from The Gran Teatre Del Liceu in Barcelona. It seems anything from this stage is worth serious consideration for your collection.

I found the music so exhilirating and even emotionally moving, that I had to leave the room...I'd return felling much better..and there it would be again...soaring,and  melifluous, with a fabulously rich melodic phrasing accomplished  by virtuosos ..with period stringed instruments, including the great ""Chitarro""...(sp?) (Guitar).

Since we are about to embark on a journey to Hell and then to Heaven, the composer thoughtfully treated us all to the most soothing music in the Universe, allowing us to feel our own hopes and fears...much the way we did in the cinematic version

of ""What Dreams May Come"", with Robin Williams....and carries us all the way through Hell and up to Michael the Archangel, and to Heaven.

And if you think you can sing Italian arias, and Bel Canto?...these are much harder...and this cast is so good they can toy with that sumptuous melodic complexity.

It is the closest to actual music from Heaven which you will hear as you are being escorted from the horror below .. up and up you go",1142294400,,1263,5.014354066985646

7973202,4,B00006SKVU,"This is a fine introduction to Monteverdi's Orfeo.  All of the singers have rich, beautiful voices, the period instruments are a pleasure to watch, and the audio and visual qualities of the DVD are excellent.  The filming of a live stage performance is handled unobtrusively excerpt for the parts when the Messenger sings directly in front of the wide-angle lens camera.  Among the things I disliked was the fact that the Spirits and Euridice wear opaque veils in the underworld scenes; the veils not only obscure the dramatic effect but also seem to interfere with their singing.  Orpheus's plastic lyre looks like a high school prop.  The timing of the English subtitles is also awkward and there is no option to display the Italian libretto.  The acting is sometimes a bit exaggerated and artificial (on purpose?), but the music throbs with emotion and is always stunning.",1127692800,,875,4.958904109589041
