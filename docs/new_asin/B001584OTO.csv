8257691,4,B001584OTO,"These Asian action films really know how to deliver; great martial arts action and humor to spare. The Koreans seem to be taking a page from the Chinese in this aspect and they are doing a fine job of film-making these days. Shin Eun-Kyung reprises her role as gang leader Chaun-Jin with the same wit and wickedness that made the first film so much fun. Chaun-Jin sustains a serious head injury that causes her to lose her memory and is taken in by a kind man that gives her a job delivering food for his restaurant. But soon her whereabouts are revealed to the White Shark, the rival gang that has been waiting for their chance at revenge on Chaun-Jin. Soon, she must fight again to keep what she has fought so hard for in her past... and in her new life.
It seems fairly obvious that Shin Eun-Kyung is not performing the martial arts fighting in these films but when you're having so much fun with it, who cares? And if you are very, very patient, you will see a cameo of Zhang Ziyi at the end of the film.",1214265600,4,1008,4.282722513089006
