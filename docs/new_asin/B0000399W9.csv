1260421,5,B0000399W9,"I've always loved this movie, since I always thought that the rapport between George C. Scott, playing Lt. Kinderman, Father Dyer, portrayed by Ed Flanders, was just wonderful. Their friendship, as portrayed by both actors, was acerbic yet warm, with great affection beneath the surface of riffing off one another. I always thought it was sort of a shame that they only share about 30 minutes of screen time, yet Father Dyer's death at the hands of The Gemini Killer was essential to setting up the conflict between Kinderman and the monster that had taken control of poor Father Karras. In any case, I definitely recommend this film to anyone who ""The Exorcist"", and despised the sequel ""Exorcist 2"" as being a pantload of crap.
Oh, one other goof that was not mentioned in the trivia notes. In the final scene, which shows a close-up of Father Karras' headstone, the date of his death is shown as being October 9, 1975. However, the careful viewer of ""The Exorcist"" will note that the events of that movie took place in 1973...also, in the first act, one can see children in costumes, trick-or-treating in the neighborhood where the MacNeil's live, indicated that the movie begins in late October, and ends with the climactic exorcism, and Father Karras' subsequent death, in the first weeks of November (the filmmakers were always a little vague as to the exact date.) So, Father Karras' headstone should read ""Died, November __, 1973""",1504915200,,1438,4.873469387755102

If this was Blatty's vision, I have to say (as much as I tend to disagree with such a comment in most instances) that the studio called it correctly. Disregarding the uneven cutting needed to bring this together, it provided nothing but evidence that the technical tweaks in every sense enhanced the production. Disappointing to say the least considering that ever since I had heard that there was something more out there, something better, that after nearly thirty years of waiting it was more myth and rumor.",1496188800,,563,4.936842105263158

1260434,4,B0000399W9,"'Exorcist III' was an underrated film at the time of its release that followed the 1st Exorcist film, rather than the 2nd. It focused on Lt. Kinderman (played very well by the late, great George C. Scott) who was still haunted by the death of Fr. Damien Karras so many years earlier during the events of the original 'Exorcist'. Soon, people start turning up dead, and a church is horribly defaced. The murders bear the hallmarks of a killer once known as 'Gemini'. The main problem: the 'Gemini' Killer died in the electric chair over a decade before! Brad Dourif, best known for his role as the voice of 'Chucky' in the 'Child's Play' films) is chilling as the 'Gemini Killer', manifesting himself among the living. This film has one of the most frightening scenes in horror movie history, in the hospital hallway as a nurse turns away from a desk to go down a hall! That sequence scared me half to death as an 18-year-old.

Included here are both the theatrical release and 'Director's Cut', which, as it turns out, was pieced together using footage from some of the old VHS release (?), as it explains a lot of shots that director Blatty wanted included had been lost. The Director's Cut appears to be only slightly longer than the original, but I find both versions still greatly watchable. This one is a MUST for fans of the film - and the series.",1488758400,,1353,4.567901234567901
1260435,3,B0000399W9,"I don't know if it's because I hadn't seen this film in a few years, or that it took the Director's Cut to make me see that it is a very bad movie. Bad ""TV"" acting, bad dialogue, and a very convoluted storyline. And I'm finding myself seeing for the first time that a really good story was missed that should have been told: Kinderman's daughter gets possessed by the demon. Nice and simple.

No Gemini Killer crap, no ""Damian is back from the dead"" crap.

And, also, upon seeing the Director's Cut, I find it infuriating that so many others that have seen it miss that Blatty had originally cast Brad Dourif to play Damien Karris, not just the Gemini Killer.
Thank god that Morgan Creek forced him to re-write and re-film large chunks of the movie and bring in Jason Miller.

But, sadly, I see that even that the theatrical version is a bad movie that hasn't aged well.

I am very familiar with the book ""Legion"", and also very familiar with everything about the film. I bought and read the book when it came out in 1983, and first saw the movie when it hit theaters back in 1990, and have watched it several times over the years.

Matter of fact, there was a time in the mid 80's when I was interested in trying to adapt the book into a screenplay, but never really did anything with it other than doing some cover art and a small two or three page treatment.

And as I said, watching the film again (especially after watching the Director's Cut), I now realize what a bad, dated, convoluted film it is.

The acting is pedestrian, TV movie material, ugh. George C. Scott is way too over the top in so many scenes. The dream sequence is atrocious, and looks like something made-for-TV quality.

Plus, I've always thought that the dream sequence was in the wrong spot, and would have been better suited if it had been at the end of the film after Kinderman shot Karris and the scene cuts to the sun, then it could have cut to the dream sequence, then end.

But, it still wouldn't have saved what is in my opinion a very convoluted mess of a screenplay.
The whole ""let's bring Damien Karris back from the dead, and he is possessed by the Gemini Killer who happened to have been put to death as Damien flung himself out the window at the end of 'The Exorcist' and has inhabited his body for 15 years"" is beyond ridiculous.

H*ll, it almost makes Boorman's sequel a classic in comparison, lol.

And, yes, having Kinderman's daughter being possessed would kind of be a retread of ""The Exorcist"", but all these years later, I just think that would have made for the better story for Blatty to have pursued.

And, no, I didn't find it to be confusing, I am just now realizing how convoluted it all is. And, I probably sounded too harsh about the film initially, because honestly I do still like it a lot, and am glad it was made (even though I've always wished the title would have been ""Exorcist III: Legion"").

Some of the comments I made about the pedestrian acting (especially in the dream sequence) has always been a complaint of mine, and am noticing it even more on recent viewings. But, I guess not everyone can get such top drawer realistic portrayals from their cast like Freidkin can.

I'm also really just now noticing for the first time how the music and demonic sounds are also so over-the-top and really unnecessary. And don't get me started on some of the cheap jump scares that lead to nothing (I saw in other reviews people talking about this, and people would try to defend it by saying that ""The Exorcist"" also had those, but no that movie did not - yes, it had some ""false scares"", but they were not cheaply done at all).

And, again, thank god that Morgan Creek stepped in and made Blatty re-shoot some scenes, including the ending, because his original ending sucked loud!

And the whole casting Brad Dourif as Damien Karris was a horrendous decision that was rightfully rectified, as I already mentioned.

After all these years, I can only rate this as a mediocre three-star (out of five) sequel to The Exorcist, one of the greatest horror films of all time, but I still highly recommend purchasing the Special Edition Scream Factory blu-ray, because it is filled with special features that make it well worth the purchase!

Again, it is definitely worth the investment to get the Scream Factory blu-ray!

Thank you!",1487462400,,4334,4.498089171974522

1260437,3,B0000399W9,"Alright folks, it's your good ole' friend Captain Howdy here and I've got a real problem.
I love the Exoricst...I think it is literally an untouchable irreproachable, infallible masterpiece.
I watch it once every year and find something new to love about it.
Yes, the detective is the weakest part of the original with his Peter Falk like awkwardness. It really doesn't fit.
However, the rest of the movie is so flawlessly done that you can easily overlook this element.
So when they made a second sequel, ignoring the awful disaster that is Exorcist II, and got Blatty to write and direct, I was all over it. I saw it in the theater, I bought it on DVD, I read the book, I now own it on Bluray.
Let me say that Blatty is underrated as writer and a director. He has an ear for dialogue and character that is on Stephen King's level, except a little more neurotic and stylized. Think David Mamet meets Stephen King.
This movie has some absolutely brilliant stretches in it. I mean brilliant as in, director's in 2017 wish they could be as clever and restrained.
However, and this is a big however, it now pains me to say this because I love an underdog company, but this transfer by Scream has kind of ruined the movie for me.
Scream sharpens and brightens the hell out of movies and shows you things that were never intended to be seen in a movie.
It's like a x-ray of an painting, Manet with Dog's playing poker underneath. How are you supposed to process that?
This is not the movie that I saw in the theaters. This isn't even the same movie on dvd.
This is a movie so bright and over scanned that you see all the seams.
The mesmerizing scenes between Kellerman and the Zodiac were supposed to be very very dim and frightening. Here they are so bright that you can see Jason Miller's 90's version of crazy hair (read:hairspray) and it f-ing ruins what was startling before.
Film was supposed to hide things. DP's knew what would be seen and not seen by film and by scanning the crap out of the negative or interpositive or whatever element was available for this transfer they have killed the mood. Now it looks cheap. Really frustrating.
And that f-ing cover. What were they thinking. George C Scott a man with some artistic integrity (go look it up) would be rolling in his grave, if he knew he would be represented on the cover by a High Schoolers last minute pastel project.

They did this overscanning with Psycho II Bluray. A movie shot by Dean Cundey, regarded as one of the Princes of Darkness in the DP world, because of Scream's transfer, the movie looks flat, universal backlot cheap and makes you wonder why you ever loved it.

This movie is better than you think or expect, just don't watch this bluray version. Buy the DVD or maybe check out the original bluray part of the set. I'm not sure, it doesn't get great ratings, but it has to better than this.",1486166400,,2870,4.4543726235741445

This Collector's Edition is full of extras on 2 discs including the original version. If you have the entire Exorcist series then, of course, then this is a must have.
Retooling this from lost and found archives results in a great loss in quality which can be somewhat distracting when viewing from one scene to another. The storyline is straight forward and rather one dimensional.
I still prefer the original. I thought it was brilliant. Well put together and rather frightening. Of course Brad Dourif was masterful. Wickedly scary.

The movie does start out pretty slow, but the acting is top notch and it delivers plenty of scares toward the end. Brad Dourif's role as the Gemini Killer is especially haunting. It starts off 15 years after the events of The Exorcist, with a very similar style, but takes the story of of demon possession into much deeper territory.

1260478,4,B0000399W9,"The original Exorcist is one of my absolute favorite movies and personally speaking, I think this third film is far better than most people would have you believe. Sure it's not the classic that the first one was but what this film has is some pretty terrifying moments, a pretty decent story with several meaningful callbacks to the original and probably one of the scariest scenes in all of film history. Brad Dourif shines in this film especially. This may actually be my favorite performance of his, with him delivering some truly frightening monologues at times that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand at end. Ed Flanders is pretty good in his considerably short screen time as well as George C. Scott who stars here in one of his final performances. If you've never seen this film, I think now's the time especially if you like horror movies.

This film has a bit of a storied history attached to it, with the theatrical version being a far different film from what writer/director William Peter Blatty had intended. This Scream Factory release does a great job of documenting this by including not only some candid behind the scenes featurettes with key cast and crew but the ""Legion"" cut of the film itself, a patchwork cut of the film culled together from available sources. The featurettes on their own are informative and insightful, with some killer quotes from a few of the people involved but this new cut of the film doesn't really fare as well. The sources used to put the film together are of VHS quality and screened in 4:3 ratio for one, which provides for a pretty jarring viewing experience whenever the new/alternate scenes come up. As for the overall film itself, this may be one of the few times in my life where a studio's meddling on a film actually made it a better film than what was originally meant to be. The theatrical version is here of course and looks and sounds pretty darn good, with a 5.1 DTS-HD MA mix that's pretty heavy on the low end side of things. The picture looks good. It's not pitch perfect but far above what's been available previously.

All fans of this film would do well to pick this one up. It's a solid horror film and a lot smarter than most of them, especially the ones released over the last ten to fifteen years. The extras make this even more of a must buy and overall, I can completely recommend this one to those who can enjoy a slow burn horror film that can get pretty intense at times.",1478649600,,2466,4.526905829596412
1260479,5,B0000399W9,"The theatrical version is one of my favorite films of all time.  This new Blue-Ray release is very well done with an awesome 5.1 audio and brilliantly enhanced picture/color quality that brings so much more appreciation in watching this film.  It's a must buy and I highly recommend it.  Now....for so long I've been waiting anxiously for the new ""director's cut"" to be released.  When I got it in the mail the other day I ripped open the packaging like a 5 year old kid on Christmas morning eager to view this new version of one of my favorite movies.  So I put it on....and I sat there through the entire 105 minutes and could hardly believe what I was seeing.  It was terrible!  Every new scene was in 4:3 compared to the widescreen format for the rest of the film.  Some scenes weren't even in color.  Some of my favorite scenes from the original film were deleted and there was no Jason Miller or Nicol Williamson (as Father Morning) even though both actors names were credited at the beginning of the film.  Both actors are sorely missed in this ""director's cut"" and the film just doesn't work without them.  All of Brad Dourif's ""new"" scenes were most likely ""take one"" during filming and were quite aweful and no where near as intense or well acted as they were in the theatrical version.  Brad Dourif's portrayal of both Father Damian Karras and the Gemini Killer is confusing and doesn't even work at all.  Quite stupid really. This so-called ""director's cut"" is a classic example of ""DON'T FIX IT IF IT AIN'T BROKEN"".  I now understand why Morgan Creek ""forced"" William Peter Blatty to make drastic changes to his final cut of the film.  IT NEEDED IT!  This ""director's cut"" will probably go down in history as one of the worst films ever assembled.  Watching the ""director's cut"" made me feel like I had just sat through four quarters of the Super Bowl watching my favorite team lose.  And it was a blowout!",1478476800,,1919,4.56140350877193

Now what was changed you can look that up but what I will say is both version of this film is worth watching.  I do however like the Theatrical Cut slightly better.

My opinion save your money.",1478304000,,371,4.796875
1260484,5,B0000399W9,"I assume that many people who are looking at this product are doing so because they already know the film and wonder if the upgrade to Blu-ray is worth the money. Long story made short: if you have an appreciation for this movie, it is worth every penny to buy on Blu-ray.

For those people reading reviews to determine if they should watch this movie for the first time: This is the film adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel ""Legion"" which he wrote as a sequel to ""The Exorcist"". The plot does not cleanly fall into the horror genre like its predecessor; rather it seems to fit better in a supernatural detective thriller, something closer to the noir genre. Kinderman, the detective who investigated Burke Denning's death in the first story, is back investigating a string of homicides. The only connections are Regan's exorcism and a long-dead serial killer. The book was meant to be an exploration of good and evil, of (Catholic) God's plan for us. The movie, rewritten by Blatty himself (who is notorious for revising his own work), is more narrow and simply acts as a basic search for God. This movie is far more philosophical on the surface than ""The Exorcist"" and therefore is slower in pace and more contemplative. Personally, I have always loved it, but it isn't for everyone.

On the Scream Factory Blu-Ray release: I could not have been happier with this release. As a fan of the film, I have always hoped that something of the cut footage would be found and restored in the form of a Director's Cut. The film is well-known for being overwhelmed by unsatisfied studio execs who just wanted another ""Exorcist"". While the original negatives couldn't be located, video tape of the dailies were found with a large portion of the original cut of the film still intact. Scream Factory did its best to splice those scenes back into the film (they are VHS-quality and in full-frame) and restore the film as close to Blatty's approved script as possible. The result is a 2-disc extravaganza for fans of the film. Disc 1 contains a beautiful 2k version of the theatrical cut of the film (previously the only cut available at all except for the ambitious Spicediver fan edit, which was an early, unauthorized attempt to create a director's cut) with a wonderful mastering of the sound. Included on this disc are a collection of interviews with cast and crew which, while probably available somewhere, were never on any DVD release of this film, so will probably be new to most fans. Also of note on this disc is a collection of cut footage (some of which isn't even in the Director's Cut) and outtakes which are fascinating to watch. Some of the bloopers are quite funny.

The big draw for this release of the film is Disc 2: The Director's Cut. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the most notable changes are the completely restored original performance by Brad Dourif as the Gemini Killer/Damian and a completely different ending with no exorcism scene. Dourif's performance in this version is far more subtle than in the theatrical cut (which was his second version of the part) and, in my opinion, more creepy. The tension stems from his almost flippant discussion of murder and evil, his casual nature as opposed to his insistent and violent theatrical version. I don't know that I prefer one approach over the other (Dourif alone or Dourif/Miller combo), as they both have their merits. The ending to this cut of the film is perhaps more bleak and open-ended. It was abrupt and jarring, and still not like the ending to the novel. Overall, I find this cut to be closer in style and nature to the novel, so it wins me over there. Whether I would say one cut of the film is superior to the other, I cannot be sure. I've spent so much time appreciating the theatrical version that I could never turn my back on it completely.

Special features on Disc 2 are plentiful, but the multi-part ""Making of"" feature is absolutely enlightening for fans. Everyone has their own opinion of how this movie went, with blame being predictably placed on everyone (studio people blame Blatty, Dourif blames studio...). The fact that everyone is probably correct demonstrates what a confused mess the production of this film probably was. It also paints the film's creation in a whole new light, one that breaks down the creative process of adapting a novel to screen, how actors approach their roles, how cast and crew get along, and how the industry has so many factions with various (sometimes competing) goals. Couple this with the interview with Blatty himself, which acts as a proxy for a director's commentary, and you get a fairly complete picture of the making of this film, one that is far more honest than almost any behind-the-scenes features have ever been (save for Bill Condon's self-flagellating commentary for ""Candyman 2"").

Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Blatty's work overall, and definitely fans of this film specifically. The Director's Cut is the long-lost version of the film we always wondered about and it was definitely worth Scream Factory's time to put it together, and for us to watch it. Once again, Scream Factory has given fans a fantastic release of a fantastic film.",1477958400,,5234,4.747252747252747
1260485,1,B0000399W9,"NO. Just no! No No No. Lame, pedestrian and lame. Sack of wine crapola. Just miserably boring. The dialog is deep and that's not the issue; the movie is just lame, boring, inane. What a shame. This was unnecessary; was not needed to be made.

(@Trjgirl) says it best in her one star review: ""The ending is just laughable, bad special effects and goofily dressed extras trying to do an impression of the portal to hell.""

^ Ding Ding Ding! If anyone CANT see that is exactly how it is emphatically, well then you are one of those rabid lemmings, not unlike the George Romero bots, who if he made a poop walk, they'd think it was the greatest thing since the discovery of the cotton gin.

That sad hole in the hospital floor LMAO. How cheap, how utterly sad. I had so many choices last night, and I can't believe I ruined my true love and appreciation of the original decades earlier, with this absolute abomination. What is cheese? George C. Scott mumbling, nearly incoherent line delivery and unnecessary temper, which is classic George C. Scott stealing a scene for himself. What is cheese, the ridiculous and sophomoric writing, trying to add depth to a story that should have left well enough alone. Bringing back Karras into the body of the Gemini Killer, what? Leave well enough alone already. How foolish, ruins the majesty of Jason Miller's great job in the first one.

Brad Dourif's playing Gemini or whatever he was, was really well done. I suppose. The long dialog wasn't the issue. If you could sit through it. Yeah its that long, but the intellectuals will of course give it A plus on development and tension. WHAT? Its meandering, its too long, its winded and its overacted at times, especially near the end.

I enjoyed seeing Nancy Fish. She was wooden, but good. Wooden on purpose, ya know, like the way that Lucas apparently informed Hayden to be wooden and stoic and emotionless playing Young Anakin. Yeah that worked. EPIC FAIL.

1260487,2,B0000399W9,"Was suspicious from the get-go because of Blatty's lack of involvement. Reminds me of when Anchor Bay did the same thing with ""Wicker Man"" with addition of scenes taken from another source and it looked terrible, ruining the enjoyment of the film for me. This is another case of such greed to cash in on a notorious director's cut that didn't happen. But honestly, Blatty's done this before with the original ""Exorcist"" and got his wish to add additional scenes that really did not make the film any better. Just watch the original cut, it's effective as hell and all the good stuff is still there.",1477526400,,598,4.650943396226415

The extra scenes are from a poorly sourced VHS copy of Blatty's dailies.  They put this together based on Blatty's original concepts and not by the final cut done by Blatty before the studio ordered re-shoots (that cut's negatives are still MIA and rumoured to have been destroyed).  With that said I did like the enhanced dialogue between the Gemini killer (Dourif) and Kinderman.  It seems to flow better then the theatrical version.  I found it bizarre that Kinderman clearly refers to Dourif's character as Father Damien since he looks like him and the Gemini Killer finally admits it, despite the fact Jason Miller isn't in this version at all.  The switch from scenes clearly from the VHS tape can be jarring but by the end the viewer gets used to it.  Blatty also stated in the past his original cut was more bloodier.  This version isn't at all.  The murder scenes of the young boy, the two priests and the two nurses are exactly, frame by frame, the same in the released version.  Furthermore the ending is a complete let down.  I can now understand why the re-shoots took place.  I give the theatrical version 5 stars.  I love it.  It's perfect the way it is.  This version I give two stars.  I had hoped for something massive.  At 1 hour and 30 minutes I have a hard time believing this would have been the version we would have seen in the theatres if Morgan Creek hadn't interfered.",1477440000,,1529,4.538461538461538

Having not owned this on blu ray before, the transfer on the theatrical cut is tremendous! Crystal clear! This version gets 5 stars hands down.

The directors cut is one of the biggest rip off tragedies ever attempted!!! Scream announced it and we were all sucked in preordered blah blah blah. Then they came out and said oh most of it is lost so they went to VHS copies to source other scenes. These scenes are put in and not mastered so they're easy to pick out. In my opinion they brought nothing to the movie and actually made the movie a piece of garbage!! The theatrical cut is FAR superior! The directors cut is so bad that if it was actually the original cut, no one would have ever enjoyed it and the film would have been completely thrown away. Absolutely will NEVER watch the directors cut again and shame on scream factory for selling us a bill of goods!!

It's loosely based on the book ""Legion"" written by William Peter Blatty, who wrote and directed the movie himself.

It has one of the best scare scenes I've ever seen.

On the down side, it has some iffy plot elements inherited from the book, plus a few of its own.

The Gemini Killer supposedly wants to torture Patient X by using his body to kill people. But that doesn't make sense since the Gemini never kills anyone using that body.

Some of the special effects look a little weird. Some look really good. Some don't.

Also, Lieutenant Kinderman thinks killing Patient X will stop the Gemini, but that doesn't make sense since the killer has been jumping into other bodies at will through the whole movie.

The exorcism sequence added to the movie during reshoots is actually a good idea in a way because a successful exorcism would have explained why the Gemini can't just move to another body.",1476403200,,969,4.566473988439307
1260491,5,B0000399W9,"Late in August of 1990, William Peter Blattys anticipated THE EXORCIST III arrived in theaters. The Morgan Creek production, released by Fox, drew strong initial interest from audiences  and even a few positive reviews  before crashing quickly in the dumping grounds of late summer. Now a cult favorite, Blattys own adaptation of his novel Legion has been resurrected as a Scream Factory Collectors Edition, complete with a reconstruction  from the best surviving sources  of Blattys initial cut of the film, completed before anxious studio executives mandated a punchier, effects-laden conclusion be shot.

George C. Scott stars in the film as Lt. Kinderman, the Washington, D.C. cop played by Lee J. Cobb in the 1973 William Friedkin classic. Here tasked with solving a series of grizzly murders carrying an increasingly religious connotation, Kindermans investigation includes both the death of his beloved friend Father Dyer (Ed Flanders, in funny scenes that make you wish he and Scott had more screen time together) and the strange presence of Patient X (Brad Dourif)  a hospital inmate who claims hes the Gemini Killer. The only problem is that psycho died some 15 years before, on the same night the demon claimed the life of Father Karras (Jason Miller) in the Regan MacNeil exorcism

Part psychological thriller, part supernatural chiller, The Exorcist III largely bypasses the shock effects of the 1973 film in favor of a moody, weird, off-kilter picture heavy on atmosphere and sound design. Blatty accentuates creaking floors, blowing winds, words muttered in whispers and the power of suggestion for the films first half, making for an intelligent and uneasy mystery that connects intriguingly with the original film. Individual moments linger long after the film has concluded (Kindermans dream sequence, an elderly hospital patient crawling on the ceiling!), making for a film thats endlessly repeatable and superbly performed by Scott, Dourif and Blattys repertory company (Miller, Flanders, Scott Wilson).

Unfortunately for Blatty, Morgan Creek and Fox executives were horrified when they saw the first version of the picture, which  to be fair  fizzled out after a strong start. Thinking audiences needed to actually see an exorcism, a hefty sum was spent on extensive new shooting, bringing along scores of special effects artists and the participation of both Jason Miller  reprising Father Karras  and Nicol Williamson, who were added to the cast in post-production reshoots that, by all accounts, were problematic to produce. And, admittedly, the subsequent, ultimate transition between the subtle and the explicit was always a little bit jarring in The Exorcist III, as the films most effective passages  like that long shot down the hotel corridor, showing a nurse checking in and out of various rooms  were comparatively low-key.

Yet if theres anything this new Shout Factory Blu-Ray confirms, its that those restless executives were onto something. The Directors Cut (104 mins.) of The Exorcist III illustrates that the tinkering was, in fact, necessary, as Blattys original version promises more than it actually delivers.

The main difference between the two cuts lies in Brad Dourifs performance. Dourif was cast to play both Patient X as well as Father Karras, with the film establishing Dourif via photographs as the protagonist of the first film. The problem, though, is that Dourif was neither Jason Miller nor did Blatty really dive into the suggestion that Father Karras was, somehow, buried inside the man claiming to be the Gemini Killer. The reshoots clarified and further developed that notion, and the casting of Miller himself added a major component lacking from Blattys cut. Its not a knock on Dourif  whose performance in the Directors Cut is subtler and may have been altogether creepier  but the overriding story is crystalized in the theatrical version to palpable dramatic effect.

More over, all the razzle dazzle of the reshoots actually gave the film a climax thats also absent in Blattys version. What begins as a tantalizing mystery turns into a frustrating, and emotionally chilly, thriller that abruptly ends on a major down note in Blattys cut. Theres just no pay off, nothing to justify the build-up, in what Blatty originally produced, making one conclude that what may have worked fine on the printed page needed the proverbial more en route to the screen.

Shouts Blu-Ray offers new interviews with surviving cast/crew members, including Brad Dourif, producer Carter DeHaven, production designer Leslie Dilley, loads of make-up artists, bit players in the supporting cast, and composer Barry DeVorzon among others. Editor Todd Ramsay relays several fascinating tidbits, including the revelation that he knew he was sitting with Blatty for the final time when he unspooled his edit of the film  to negative reaction from seemingly everyone involved, except Dourif, who thinks his performance was much better in Blattys version. Meanwhile, DeVorzons talk implies studio brass didn't like his score either  with even Carter DeHaven seemingly unenthusiastic over his initial hiring  which is no shock since theres less music in the film than there is sound design (though in that regard, DeVorzons work was ahead of its time).

The interviews are all candid and interesting, and a full-length commentary (dubbed an audio interview) between Blatty and Michael Felsher is wide-ranging and accompanies the Directors Cut itself. There are also vintage EPK materials sporting interviews with the likes of Scott, Blatty, and Larry King (who has a cameo along with Samuel L. Jackson, C. Everett Koop and Fabio!), plus trailers and TV spots, several of which carry unused FX shots. A few minutes of deleted scenes/bloopers are on-hand as well, including a discarded prologue taken from film elements (albeit in black-and-white).

Most of the new/alternate materials, however, are derived from VHS dailies  all that remains of Blattys first version of the picture. With that being considered, Shout has painstakingly assembled his Legion in a 104-minute reconstruction that varies between HD footage from the theatrical version and 1.33-based videotape material. Its unfortunate that the original materials couldn't be found, but Shout has done the best job possible with what they had to work with, and Id imagine this cut will likely rank as just a curiosity for many to begin with.

The theatrical version, meanwhile, has been given a brand new 2K transfer and its a knockout. Featuring clearer details, more consistent colors and contrasts than Warners earlier Blu-Ray, this is a sterling 1080p (1.85) transfer that does justice to Gerry Fishers cinematography in a way that no prior home video release ever has, and ranks with Shouts top Blu-Ray transfers to date.

The sound, regrettably, doesnt fare quite as well. When The Exorcist III transitioned from Fox over to Warner Bros. (Morgan Creeks most recent studio home), the movies original stereo audio was remixed into a muddy 5.1 track that was, in short, an unmitigated disaster. Left/right separation and surround activity were all, inexplicably, fed into the center channel instead, making for a botched 5.1 track thats all viewers have had to listen to since the days of laserdisc and VHS.

Shouts Blu-Ray, overall, might be a small improvement, but its still a far cry from the movies intended stereo design. Apparently, Shout could not find the original audio materials, as the 5.1 and 2.0 DTS MA mixes on the theatrical version are just a little bit healthier in terms of fidelity than that terrible Warner mix. Shouts 5.1 track does boast a little bit of stereophonic presence from time to time, but mostly plays out like its predecessor in a cramped, one-channel presentation. The Directors Cut is even more flat, housed in a 2.0 DTS MA mix that boasts no discernable stereo separation of any kind.

That disappointment aside, Screams Exorcist III is yet another outstanding package from the label this Halloween  a must for horror buffs and a celebration of Blattys personal Exorcist sequel that has weathered the years better than its unholy counterparts. Looking for a clear invitation to the dance? Well, weve got it!",1475625600,,8240,5.248097412480974

Synopsis

For more than fifteen years Police Lieutenant Kinderman (George C. Scott) has been haunted by the death of his friend Father Damien Karras. Now, on the 15th anniversary of the exorcism that claimed the priests life, Kindermans world is once again shattered when a boy is found decapitated and savagely crucified. Its just the beginning of a nightmare series of bizarre religious murders.
The brutal murders bear the hallmarks of the infamous Gemini Killerwho died in the electric chair fifteen years earlier. But when a psychopath claiming to be the Gemini Killer reveals intimate, gruesome details that only the true killer could possibly know, Kinderman is confronted with a horrifying truth that he cannot explainand that will shake him to the core.
The Exorcist III is author/filmmaker William Peter Blattys personal vision of what followed after The Exorcist. Like the original, The Exorcist III combines elements of a detective story, a theological puzzle, and an unforgettable study in terror.

The book it's based on LEGION is way too talky, too much theology so the story is a little muddled with too many characters. Blatty fixes all of that in the film. Sadly, studio intervention forced the lame, over-the-top ending.

Kinderman -- chose this film to over act.  I don't think he cared about this particular job.  The original film Lt. Kinderman, Lee J. Cobb, would have been a much better choice.
The supporting cast is excellent, although Jason Miller (Karas) is under-used.  Brad Dourif (Doc, in HBO's ""Deadwood"") is, as always, outstanding in his best role since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
Mr. Blatty's direction has some excellent parts, but the film bogs down and leaves too many holes in the story.

1260547,4,B0000399W9,"A plague upon all thriller/horror film franchises is that audiences expect to be fed more of the same with each subsequent entry, and creators cannot wait to confound and divert expectations but often end up with cold shoulders instead of warm receptions (just ask John Carpenter). In truth, there was no real way to follow up what William Friedkin did with 1973's ""The Exorcist"" whether or not you love it or hate it (think it's a good movie or think it's a bad movie) but under any prime judgment it was not the kind of film that either warranted or setup a sequel. Then, the world was introduced to the humanist/fantasist visions of British director John Boorman who wowed (or at least disturbed) the movie world with ""Exorcist 2: the Heretic,"" a film that carried little (if any) of the threat-inducing unpleasantness and naughtiness of the Friedkin original, and audiences could not see what the point was due to the film's failure as a true exploitation venture. The Boorman film is still shocking to critics--it employed an unusual choice for its director, it relied upon the sexiness of a young Linda Blair for its main appeal, it gave a wobbly Richard Burton a big paycheck but no essential role with any meat on it, and it gave composer Ennio Morricone the opportunity to create some unusual soundscapes inspired by the weird but hardly frightening narrative (and really, Boorman's film is the most beautiful of the series, what with cinematographer William A. Fraker's amazing lighting work alongside close-ups of Linda's pretty face, but its sense of aesthetic quality minus true on screen shocks alarmed many at the time of its release).
In 1980, William Blatty (whose choice of a career in the entertainment business is still unusual even though it was always a dream of his to be involved in movies, and in book publishing to boot), whose thrilling and ultimately terrifying novel began the exorcism craze in popular culture, released his ""official"" follow-up to ""The Exorcist"" with (I think the rather brilliant) ""The Ninth Configuration"", a film that will either change your life or leave you scratching your head saying ""how could anyone ever like this crap (?)""--but the bottom line is, ""The Ninth Configuration"" did not connect with its intended audience at all, but to me this only proved how challenging (and self-assured) of a filmmaker that Blatty had actually become (though he was known as a writer and literary figure after the novel came out, Blatty's old stomping grounds had actually been screenwriting and film productions, I suspect with an eye towards theater). He ultimately proved with ""The Ninth..."" that his vision was more idiosyncratic and less simplistic than some realized after watching the movie known as 'the one.'
""The Exorcist 3"" does not really belong to the horror genre at all but instead to the psychology mystery/thriller genre, and the fact that Blatty attempted to have the project setup as a TV series first certainly makes it easier to understand the ""Matlock""/""Night Stalker"" combination of aesthetics that are at play in it (in short, it couldn't be any different than the two films that preceded it--three if you count the Keach film--and this is one thing that I enjoy most about the ""Exorcist"" film series, the fact that each new film reinvents the genre). I enjoy the TV/late 1980's mystery/detective feel to this movie, but it doesn't feel as right as it should in places (despite the fact that it's often close to a ""Ninth Configuration"" cast reunion). In fact, despite the fact that we only get to see the rather messy studio cut on this disc (the place to discuss the problems with this film's post-production is certainly not here, but I would advise you to read up on it if you are interested), the film seems as if it may have worked better if it had been produced instead as a TV miniseries, as it carries none of the genuine cinematic shaping that informed the original entry, or even the much-damned Boorman sequel, with Blatty using medium-shots and wide angles that emphasize the stressed (and high blood pressure) look of George C. Scott's face, along with the other characters in the story, all of whom seem to be under attack from a demonic presence...but this time there is no sweet and innocent little girl to save, no poignant self-realizations among the characters, and no sense of climactic mystery that was so prevalent in Friedkin's vision. Instead, we have a rather straightforward serial killer plot that is still horrifying and still engrossing, but with less of the heartfelt drama involved in the earlier films. Still, we have a tremendous performance given by the scary-eyed Brad Dourif (whose psychotic jump-out-and-get-you nature echoes that of a younger and less humorous Jack Nicholson) who really gives a fine performance in truth (and whose essaying of Charles Lee Ray in 1988's ""Child's Play"" may have warmed him up for the blazing Hellfire of this role). Tragically, the studio allowed the overly baked and special effects leaden ending to stay put for the theatrical releases (much to Blatty's chagrin), and the film became much more situated along the lines of a horror-movie ending with its copious amount of snakes and demonic grumbling damning it to B-movie territory instead (Blatty, apparently, lost the fight for the distribution of the genuine ""director's cut""). As most serious lovers of film know, changing even the slightest things about a director's film changes the emotional and narrative content of his initial intentions and therefore sabotages his film with irreparable damage. The current Morgan Creek DVD, while it features excellent sound and moderately good picture quality, is proof of this unfortunate tampering with another's vision (whether or not you prefer Blatty's vision or not is not even the point). Again, it feels as if Blatty wanted to make a much longer film (akin to the proposed TV miniseries as mentioned above) and instead wound up having to squeeze most of his vision down into the unprofitable container of a mere two-hour ""horror"" movie. Unfortunately, this case only goes to prove that weird fiction writers often have difficulty when their work is adapted to another medium, but in this case it's really sad because Blatty was the director, and he had a long history of show business and movie industry connections. After jump-starting the public's attention in 1973, he tried to expand and solidify his vision for this narrative after coming to the conclusion that some members of the public had misidentified his novel of faith as a genuine attempt to scare the living hell out of everyone. But ""Exorcist 3"", despite its many faults in the writing and later distribution, at least provides a solid effort towards a serious-themed spiritual film that has thrills and chills without going down the path of excessive, brutal violence and replacing a genuine mystery with gory and over-the-top CGI special effects. Or at least that's how it should have been...but that's another story. The current DVD (and I believe Blu-Ray) contains no revealing documentary extras or comments from Blatty or the cast, and no cultural context for a more proper historical evaluation of the film's enduring merits. This incomplete affair is deeply troubling because the third film, while limited in its cinematic scope, was nonetheless a fascinating entry in the series. Also troubling is the new Blu-Ray of ""The Ninth Configuration"", which also contains no new revealing extras and a rather routine (except for its coloring job) video transfer. Hopefully, Mark Kermode and Blatty are still at work on reconstructing a definitive print of this movie, and maybe then a new release can be enjoyed and studied on a home screen, which to me seems to have been the proper destination of this title all along.

It is competing with the original and that one is very hard to beat, however ""Exorcist III"" is above the other inferior sequels/prequels, with the exception of maybe Schrader's prequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dominion-Prequel-to-the-Exorcist/dp/B004YSDT3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist</a>. Despite some negligent continuity issues, this film manages to get under your skin with its chilling atmosphere and psychological terror.

Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (the late George C. Scott) begins investigating a series of gruesome murders that resemble the killings committed by ""The Gemini"", a killer who was executed in the electric chair. During his investigation, Kinderman discovers a mysterious patient in a psychiatric ward - Patient X in cell 11. This patient bears a striking resemblance to his good friend Father Karras, the fallen priest who was involved in the exorcism of Regan MacNeil 15 years prior and the day the Gemini was executed.

There are moments here that are truly magnificent from a horror standpoint. The film does not rely on cheap jump scares that is so commonplace in horror. There is a lot of build-up and the film is heavy on imagery and atmosphere- from a Jesus statue opening its eyes (creepy), to a celestial dream sequence (where Fabio makes an appearance) that would have been incredibly hokey had it fallen into the wrong hands. Most of these key scenes are successful in providing the chills, despite having very minimal gore. It's all in the camera work, the music, the atmosphere, the details. For me, one of the most frightening scenes in the entire film doesn't show anything at all but a priest sitting in a darkened confessional booth listening to the sinister plights of an old woman. That scene is without a doubt, one of the creepiest scenes in a horror film. The film's biggest let-down however, is surprisingly, the exorcism scene. It was not needed. It is just a silly scene that tried to capitalize on the film's legacy and I guess the mentality of the time was, what's the point of having an ""Exorcist"" sequel without showing an actual exorcism?

The performances are great. I still cannot figure out how George C Scott was nominated for a ""Golden Raspberry"" award for Worst Actor for his performance here. He is superb (but then again, Stanly Kubrick was nominated for Worst Director for ""The Shining"" in 1981 so screw the ""Razzies""). Scott is very commanding, poised and stoic as Kinderman. I can't imagine anyone doing it better. Kudos also go to Brad Douriff who plays the Gemini. Dourif has played unpleasant characters before but here, he is genuinely creepy and his exchange with Scott is riveting. ""Exorcist III"" is a definite improvement over the much maligned first sequel, ""The Heretic"" and it remains, arguably the best sequel in the series. Despite a disappointing final quarter which is marred by a cheesy exorcism, and obvious continuity issues which I cannot turn a blind eye to, this diabolical tale of murder, God and demons is indeed chilling. It succeeded in creeping me out.

You can also find this film in the box set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist-The-Complete-Anthology/dp/B00L9K2EGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist: The Complete Anthology</a>&nbsp;, also available on DVD, which is highly recommended. It features all films in the ""Exorcist"" series. This ""Exorcist III"" DVD however is bare-bones. The only extra is the trailer and that is pretty much it. The Bluray release offers nothing new either. Considering this instalment is the best in the series outside of the original, it is a disappointing release but the film is worth owning.

1260564,3,B0000399W9,"I remember going to ""The Exorcist III"" with several friends when it was released in theaters. We were looking forward to levitating, pea-soup spewing, foul-talking demonic action. We all walked out after the film ended hating it!! At the time I preferred ""Exorcist II: The Heretic"" for it's off-the-wall insanity over this too-talky installment. Revisiting the film about a decade later I enjoyed it much more, and see this less as a horror film, and more like a dramatic thriller. Kind of like an episode of ""The X Files"" mixed with an episode of ""Criminal Minds"".

The Gemini Serial killer, thought to have been executed fifteen years earlier, seems to be stalking the streets of Georgetown, as suburb of Washington, DC. A young boy was tortured and beheaded, having the head of a Jesus statue put atop the body. Lieutenant Kinderman (George C. Scott), the detective who originally captured The Gemini is investigating the murder and discusses the case with his longtime friend, It's not long before another murder occurs and Kinderman soon realizes that The Gemini is drawing him into his bizarre world.

I don't want to give too much away, as I hate spoilers. But if you go into this film thinking it's an action packed, edge-of-your-seat horror film, you'll probably be disappointed. William Peter Blatty, the writer and director, does a fine job of creating an atmospheric film, and there are several scenes of outright horror. But this film is very, very dialogue heavy. Almost the entire climax of the film is spoken between two characters. Luckily we have to great actors sharing the screen, George C. Scott and Brad Dourif, so the scene does work pretty well, But I'm a firm believer that in a film you should ""show"" and not ""tell"", and with ""Exorcist III"" we get a whole bunch of ""tell"" and very little ""show"".

Not bad, a much better thriller and sequel than ""The Heretic"" (but not nearly as much fun as that first sequel). As a huge fan of George C. Scott, I enjoy almost every film he's in, and his relationship with Ed Flanders (Father Dyer) could've been that basis for a wonderful film of it's own. I loved the chemistry between the two men, and would love to have seen them share more screen time.

1260598,1,B0000399W9,"To each his own but I thought this movie was terrible. George C. Scott was a great actor but here he is at his growling, scene-chewing worst; the editing is horrible - the film jumps around with little or no transition; characters appear out of nowhere with no explanation; the writing is laughable. It's a hodge-podge of arguably scary moments which seem to be thrown in for effect only and do not contribute to the story. My biggest complaint is the lack of consistency and plot development.  In an encounter between Scott's character and a Dr. Temple (Scott Wilson), I could discern no explanation for the character's bizarre behavior. Suddenly, Scott's character is backing away from someone - you assume it's Temple - with a terrified expression, Temple appears behind Scott's character and you realize they're in a different location altogether. There was absolutely no transition; in fact it looked like an editing oversight!

I decided to watch it since it was on Netflix. Hey, it stars George C. Scott, who was so amazing in ""Patton."" It oughta be great, right?

Uhm, no. Okay, I was going to tell you more about the plot, but I guess I shouldn't give a spoiler even for this mess. So let me just say that George C. Scott's character in this film needs to go to anger management courses, because he screams at all sorts of people in the movie during his investigation of a string of serial killings (he's the detective in charge), including one of the nurses at a hospital.

The film just looks dated. It was made in 1990, but for all the world, to me it looks like it's from the 1960s, not so much in the fashions but the look of the film, as if the film-to-digital transfer was done using an Atari 2600.

1260624,2,B0000399W9,"Nowhere near the intensity and brilliance that was the original Exorcist.  What the film has going for it, is it's atmospheric, brooding, and has nice performances from George C. Scott, Ed Flanders, Jason Miller, and especially Brad Dourif. Where the film falls short is that it's too heavy on the brooding, the red-herring jump scares of the ""boo - gotchya"" variety, and too light on actual fright.  And while much of the horror is intended to be of the hallucinatory variety, it generally misses the mark and comes thisclose to unintentionally hilarity - such as ceiling crawling grannies in hospital gowns and Jesus statues popping their eyes open like they just got goosed. The film/book appears to me to be Blatty's attempt to synthesize the exorcism and slasher genres - both popular at the time of its original release, but it's simply unsuccessful. (The book, Legion, which I've read, works better since it is able to spend more time developing characters and especially the relationship between Kinderman and Father Dyer, which the film is forced to give short shift to. It's a decent read, anyway.) The film also - given its simple ""detective solving a case"" structure, I found rather choppy and oddly hard to follow.  The scene with the old nurse that takes a taxi to Kinderman's house - one of the film's big scare set-pieces, is just too bizarre and illogical to work.  Yes - this weird old nurse just showed up at our house for some reason.  C'mon in! Here - have a seat over there at the dining room table and hang for a while whilst we go about our jovial faux film family banter, complete with granny cracking wise straight out of an episode of The Golden Girls. Hey - don't mind us. Huh. What's with that box you're carrying? Strange. Blatty seemed to have some difficulty staging the finale of this scene, and he was bailed out by his editor on this one. Viva the quick cut! The cross-cutting between two actors (as George C Scott looks on appearing not to notice they're two different people) is also - and you'll know what I mean if/when you see the film, just too ham-fisted a technique.  Doesn't work, distracts from some fine performances. It almost seems like they wanted to ""somehow"" use Jason Miller to tie this film to the original and this was their rather clunky solution that Blatty tried to ""get away with"" by passing it off as a creative unconventional directorial technique.  Ummm.  No. Sorry. Bad choice.  Transparent, confusing, and distracting despite fine performances by both Miller and Dourif. Or maybe the one actor did actually morph into the other?  But if this happens the other person you're conversing with, I imagine, would ""react"" to this expressing some level of surprise. Mr. Scott looks on rather impassively if that's the case. Not sure what was supposed to be going on here. Maybe I've been too cruel to this flick.  I love horror films and they're an easy target to poke fun at.  Coming up with new ways to scare jaded audiences ain't an easy task. It's worth a watch if you like horror and enjoyed the original Exorcist, but barely. It has some fine performances and Blatty (or at least his cinematographer) knows how to compose and light a scene - it's, at least, a pretty and well-acted film.  It's brooding but doesn't fall prey to boredom like so many films that go for moody/atmospheric. I didn't doze off once! That said, I do think it falls way short of the ""overlooked horror masterpiece"" reputation it has garnered over the years in some circles. We all wanted a credible sequel to the original Exorcist.  But saying The Exorcist III is it, doesn't make it so.",1379808000,,3624,4.704581358609794
1260625,4,B0000399W9,"""The Exorcist"" was perhaps the best horror movie of all time.  ""The Exorcist 2:  the Heretic"" was perhaps the worst horror movie of all time.  So you'd have to figure that ""The Exorcist 3"" would split the difference.  And you'd think right.

I will say immediately that this is a very weak 4; I could easily have gone 3, and I strongly considered it.  However, it's at least a 3.5, it surely influenced quite a few other horror movies that followed (watch the scene in ""Legion"" with Dennis Quaid and you'll agree) and so I'm begrudgingly rounding up instead of down.

The first issue that I had with this film:  Lee J. Cobb played the Kinderman character in the first film, while George C. Scott played him in the third.  Sure; Mr. Scott is a very-good-to-excellent actor, but in my opinion, Mr. Cobb was one of a kind.  I wrote a review for ""On the Waterfront"" awhile ago, and in that review, I discussed the fact that I wanted to see him in an earlier film after watching his incredible performance in ""The Exorcist.""  Sure enough, Mr. Cobb was no one trick pony; he had many tricks available in his stable.  Peeking around the web, it appears that I'm not the only one that holds this opinion.  Many people today consider him to be one of the better character actors ever.

But there are other issues as well.  For one reason or another, William Peter Blatty decided to take on race issues in this film, and I found that slightly awkward.  Don't we have enough issues to worry about here, given the Devil and all his Minions, to include race relations as well?  As evidence, the film starts out with some Jewish jokes, and then continues with the grotesque murder of a black boy.  To me, it just seemed forced.

But the biggest issue here, in my opinion:  Mr. Blatty was a victim of his own success.  This film -- and any other with the word ""Exorcist"" in it -- will be compared to the original, rightly or wrongly, and it will be a cold day in hell when a film comes close to the terror of that masterpiece.

It was surely ""nice"" seeing Jason Miller once again, a man who didn't seem to get the kudos he deserved outside of the theatre community; he did win some impressive awards there.  And Brad Dourif will surely scare the hell out of you.  He scared the hell out of me.  And from the looks of it, he scared the hell out of Mr. Scott as well, even though Mr. Scott knew that both were only ""acting.""

If you decide to watch, my recommendation:  don't necessarily compare it to the first in the series.  That surely isn't fair.  But rather, compare it to other horror movies in the same genre.  That might make you appreciate it more.",1374537600,,2641,4.385567010309279

1260648,4,B0000399W9,"The rule of Hollywood series: the first movie is the best one, followed by inferior sequel, and then a third one which is guaranteed to be awful in every way.

But every rule has an exception, and one of those is ""The Exorcist III: Legion,"" which thankfully ignores the ghastly ""Exorcist II."" We can thank William Peter Blatty (author of the original ""Exorcist"" novel) who wrote and directed this movie -- and between his vivid, clever writing and some truly haunting performances, it's a gloriously eerie horror movie. The one downside: a truly awful ending pasted on by the bloody studio.

World-weary Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (George C. Scott) is called in on a series of bizarre serial killers in Georgetown -- first a young boy is crucified, decapitated and has the head of a Christ statue placed on his neck, and then a priest is brutally murdered in a confessional. But the crimes strike home for Kinderman when his good friend, Father Dyer (Ed Flanders), is found in the hospital -- decapitated, with all his blood drained.

Certain trademarks of the brutal slayings line up with ""The Gemini"" (Brad Dourif), a serial killer from fifteen years ago. But there are two slight problems with this idea: the fingerprints are all from different people, and the Gemini was executed fifteen years ago. The key to this case may lie in a mysterious patient being held at the hospital, who recently came out of a catatonic state... and claims to be the Gemini Killer, possessing another man's body.

I suspect that ""Exorcist III"" would be more highly regarded if the title did not tie it to one of the most influential horror movies of all time. This a dark, poetic movie that quietly dips into the dark waters of good and evil, and the supernatural currents that run under a horrendous murder investigation. Don't expect serial-killer gore or spinning heads -- expect a subtle, eerie experience.

It astounded me that Blatty -- a horror writer -- also turned out to be such a talented director. He lays a quiet, bleak atmosphere over this movie, painting the scenes in shadow. The most brilliant work is the conversations between the Gemini Killer and Kinderman, with the cop struggling to accept a seemingly impossible solution to these crimes, and a brutal serial killer who is charming, playful and PURE EVIL.

It also has a truly magnificent cast, with Scott taking center stage as a weary, sarcastic cop who struggles to connect the supernatural with his day-to-day job. He also has amazing chemistry with Ed Flanders, who sadly exits the movie pretty quickly -- these two have lots of dry, witty dialogue in between theological banter, and honestly I could have happily watched a whole movie full of their antics.

But Brad Dourif steals the scene every time he appears as the Gemini Killer, putting every ounce of his acting into the Gemini Killer -- unpredictable, menacing, charming and just terrifying (""I call THAT showmanship, Lieutenant!""). He's a human demon, just the sort you'd expect the forces of evil to take under their wing.

... but... then there's the ending. Hoo boy, there's the ending.

Apparently the studio was horrified at the idea of an ""Exorcist"" movie without a climactic exorcism, so the last ten minutes are a cheesy, campy, frenetic mass of special effects presided by a character who pops out of nowhere. You know, exactly what you would expect of a studio-mandated finale.

Despite the ghastly ending, ""The Exorcist III: Legion"" is a vastly underrated little horror movie -- beautifully directed and acted, with a darkly theological undercurrent. Too bad Blatty hasn't directed much else.",1364256000,,3629,4.915032679738562
1260649,4,B0000399W9,"Anyone who may have read my review of ""Exorcist 2: The Heretic"" may recall I said that movie was number 1 at being the worst movie of all time. It was to me a hugh letdown of a film after watching ""The Exorcist"" and how great a movie that was. Having said that let me state that the third installment ""Exorcist III"" is everything in a movie sequal that ""The Heretic"" wasn't. If you watched and enjoyed the original ""Exorcist"" I promise you will find this sequal a great follow-up to the first movie. It is not as shocking or grossed out as the original but there is still a lot of tension and heart pounding suspense.

In a nut shell ""Exorcist III"" takes up 15 years after the first exorcist movie ends. A series of grusome murders takes place in the Georgetown area that police Lt Kinderman is investigating. You may remember that Kinderman was played by Lee J Cobb in the original movie. In this sequal the part is now played by George C Scott who gives I think one of his best performances of his acting career. The murders are very simular to a series of murders that had been committed years ago by a serial killer called the Gemini Killer. One problem however. The Gemini Killer had been executed for those killings years ago about the same time of Regan MacNeil's exorcism. I don't want to give really anymore details away so not to spoil it for those who have not seen this movie. I will mention to be one the look out however for Jason Miller as Father Karras in this movie. Nuff said! Take my word for it though this is one great movie and sequal. Nothing really like the first movie. While there is horror in this film it is not of the intensity like the first one. So don't expect any pea soup flying around on the screen. There are a couple of scenes though that will make you jump out of your chair and possibly make your heart skip a beat or two. This movie reminds me more like a very intense episode of the TV series ""Criminal Minds"" with a heavy dose of the supernatural throw in.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who saw the first ""Exorcist"". I really do believe you will enjoy this as much as the first. If however you have never seen the original movie I would not recommend you watch part 3 until you do see the first movie. Reason being the story line of this sequal depends so much on the plot of the original ""Exorcist"" and what happened in that movie that it may be hard or confusing to follow. The important thing to remember is this sequal is everything that ""The Heretic"" wasn't, a scary good movie to watch!",1363564800,,2544,4.308977035490606

Despite being locked away in the bowels of the local hospital, the Gemini continues to kill, and it is up to Detective Kinderman to stop his supernatural murder spree! EXORCIST 3 comes as an unexpected surprise after the first disappointing sequel, combining the gripping suspense of a tightly-wrought thriller with the otherworldly terror of the original. William Peter Blatty directs this time around from his own screenplay and novel, and while his style lacks refinement, it is never-the-less effective in setting a frightening mood and delivering a strong, character-driven story. The main faults lie in his artificial language and jarring edits, but these are mostly overcome by the enjoyable performances that come as a result. George C. Scott takes a commanding lead as the boisterous Detective Kinderman, and Jason Miller excels in the role of the villain as the Gemini's earthly vessel. The real treat, however, comes from genre vet Brad Dourif in an electrifying performance as the Gemini, himself. Dourif explores a range of terrifying emotions, from calculated cruelty to raging hatred. He is at his best here. Although the majority of the film plays out like a murder mystery, EXORCIST 3 packs a fiery finale that delivers on the series' name. It has also gained a cult following for creating one of the scariest moments in all of Horror, but for that, you will just have to wait and see!

1260671,3,B0000399W9,"Brad Dourif should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his performance.  Watch for that, and for the Heavenly Waystation sequence early in the movie.  Fellini filmgoers will recognize the style.  Er, attempt at style.  Film is genuinely creepy for the first hour or so;  the tension was enough to make me pause video play so to do something else until I calmed down -- even though I've seen this movie before and remembered how it ended (just purchased though, today).  Unnerving direction where the slow parts are way too slow, and the fast parts are way too fast.  On purpose.  That contributes to the tension.  So you are relieved by the time you meet Dourif's character.

I'd bet money the other reason why Blatty chose the Fellini style was to get across how demons despise and burlesque us.  Yeah, if you know Bible well enough, that style works to show their POV, but if you don't know it well enough, the style looks like a campy horror movie, and the message is lost.

For sure, the last 15 minutes' cheesy special effects ruined the film.  Too rushed; maybe rushed on purpose, to be tragi-comic.  Worth watching anyway, for the craft of it, maybe several times.

The plotline is believable.  Good script.  Not sure I would have tried the Fellini approach with this storyline.  Someone should re-shoot it with more seriousness.  Worth doing again as a re-make, but beef up the story, put in more backstory, pace it more seriously and for God's sake, stop with the cheesy special effects.

1260672,2,B0000399W9,"I waited to see the first Exorcist until I was in my 30's because I was told how frightening the movie was, both graphically and intellectually.  When I finally did see it, everything I had been told was proven correct.  To this day, almost 20 years later, I recall the scene where Regan stood before her mother and her mother's dinner guests and wet herself.  Her pale urin ran over the wooden floor as the adults stood immobile, shocked, and watched.  The movie didn't rely on graphic descriptions of ever-increasing acts of violence.  Instead, it showed you stark terror and the inability to deal with the cause of that terror.  Even in this day of unbelievable acts of violence, that movie would still be able to draw me into that dark, bare room and horrify me.  I think Blatty must have truely seen the devil to be able to write so convincingly about it.  I approached this movie with the same trepidation.  What I saw was a film that relied on one-up-manship.  By that I mean, its not enough to have the church doors fly open and a wind surge through, roaring.  They had to have the statue of Christ open its eyes and look suitably horrified.  The murders that were done could have been sufficiently disturbing just in themselves but instead they kept adding elements to it (not just murdered, but also crucified....and decapitated...with amputation...and branding, etc etc). It got to the point where so much was piled on that it became a surfeit that instead tipped the scales to numbed disbelief.  The movie was reliant on a great deal of dialogue that slowed the pace to the point I found myself hitting fast forward just to get to *something* of interest.  I wasn't looking for a slasher/gorefest by any means.  I was looking for something more, something that touched me and has haunted me for 20 years.  I found nothing like that.  Not even close.",1318550400,,1861,4.6422018348623855
1260673,4,B0000399W9,"Out of the four films, two sequels, & two prequels (same title, different directors) of ""the Exorcist,"" only one is really worth your time, ""the Exorcist III,"" written & direct by ""the Exorcist"" author, William Peter Blatty.

""The Exorcist III"" really captures the eerie dreadful atmosphere of the first movie, that is, the first two thirds of the film. The first two thirds is filled with smart, often witty dialog, especially between, Detective Lt. William Kinderman (George C. Scott) & Father Dyer (Ed Flanders). There is a plot hole here though, as Detective Kinderman is portrayed as Father Karras's (Jason Miller) best friend who preformed the first exorcism in the first film, & Kinderman (Lee J Cobb in the first film) hardly knew Karras, though in the book, there could've been more of a relationship there? At any rate, the first two thirds of the film is just filled with very potent, imaginative, horrific scenes. The fly ceiling crawl of the old lady, as she looks down at Kinderman & smiles. The giant surgical decapitation scene in the hospital with the nurse. The office scene where Kinderman is talking about Karras with the head Preist in the Preist's office, are just a few. The cinematography & soundtrack work very well too! But...

(Spoilers)

The film starts to fall a part (loses imagination) with the introduction of ""the Gemni Killer,"" or should I say, Brad Dourif speaking through Karras's body. Not that Dourif is bad by any means. No, he is incredible in his performance, it's just that I feel all these scenes would have been more potent with Karras (Jason Miller) doing them instead of Dourif, for the plain fact it hits harder seeing the Martyr, Karras, being turned to evil, committing these crimes himself, than being possessed by a serial killer. Karras was the heart & soul of the first film, giving his life to save Regan's, so seeing him turned to evil would be all the more potent. Also, the last part of the film turns to mush, as old Satanic clichs (yes, I don't like that word, but true) are brought out of the closet, snakes, the floor cracking & people rising from hell, gore, & a very unconvincing Father Morning, played by Nicol Williamson (usually a terrific actor, Merlin in ""Excalibur) exorcising ""the Gemni Killer"" from Karras's body. As a matter of fact, the only thing that works is when ""the Gemni Killer"" leaves Karras's body, & Karras says, ""Bill, kill me now, shoot me,"" does the scene have any redemption.

For all it's flaws though, ""the Excorist III"" is a very good watch! For two thirds of the film is almost on par with the original, & that in its self is very good reason to watch this film!

1260677,5,B0000399W9,"A lot of great in-depth reviews have been written about this movie that discuss the plot, the actors, etc.  Read those reviews for that information.  In my review, I just want to give my observations on this movie.

The Exorcist III (1990) is an intelligent psychological horror film that brilliantly mixes horror and religion and the darkness of demonic possession.  This movie is the only true sequel to the original The Exorcist from 1973, yet the plot is so different from the 1973 movie.  You won't get more of the same in this movie.  This movie is totally different.  You won't see Linda Blair in this movie.  Instead, George C. Scott is present and is great in this movie (he was a great actor to begin with) as Lt. Kinderman, a demonic possession non-believer who is investigating some mysterious murders.  The acting overall is top-notch in this movie.  Cameo appearances are made by Fabio, Larry King, Samuel L. Jackson, and Patrick Ewing.  Jason Miller, who was in the first Exorcist movie, reprises his role in this movie.

The movie is boring in parts, but even during the boring parts it manages to hold my attention.  Why?  It's because the overall mood and atmosphere of the movie is superb.  The photography and cinematography are top-notch.  This movie retains a lot of the feel of the first movie, only it brings it up another level, in my opinion.  The lighting, shadows, and subtle horror are what hold my attention and make this movie interesting.  The pacing is very good as well.  The movie has very little music, but the music that is played is good.  I think this movie might require four or five viewings in order to absorb everything and understand the plot.  The movie moves slowly for the first hour and twenty minutes or so.  Then the action starts to pick up in the last twenty minutes or so and things suddenly get bizarre and a little bloody.  It almost seems like the last twenty minutes of the movie are a totally different movie altogether.  I think this movie needed an ending like this in order to kind of make up for the slow and boring parts in the first three-fourths of the movie.

All in all, it's a very good movie.  I recommend it to any horror movie fan.",1282780800,,2202,4.582051282051282

1260704,4,B0000399W9,"You know you're in trouble when the box-art for the movie in your hands doesn't bare any rave-review quotes or snippets. Far be it from the discriminating viewer to judge a book (or DVD) by its cover, though, because while ""The Exorcist III"" looks like a subpar sequel to a classic film, the fact of the matter is that there is more to it than meets the eye. A film that is notorious for tinkering by the producers, despite being in the hands of ""The Exorcist"" creator William Peter Blatty, this third entry in the saga has more brains than the average 80's horror film and more weight than any sequel within the genre is ever expected to hold.

George C. Scott plays police lieutenant Kinderman (a character seen briefly in the first film), hardened but human, who is on the trail of a mysterious, sadistic and methodical killer who takes after the famed Gemini Killer (a take on the real-life Zodiac Killer), despite the fact that he has been dead for fifteen years. When a longtime friend in Father Dyer (Ed Flanders) emerges as the next victim, a chain of events unfolds that brings back a familiar face from the past in Father Karras (Jason Miller reprising his role from the first film). Bit by bit, what Kinderman unearths turns out to be bigger than himself and threatens his very existence.

Scott is reliable and likable as always in the role of Kinderman, and while Jason Miller isn't given much to do here, it's a pleasure to see him again. Brad Dourif, best known as Chucky in the ""Child's Play"" series, is the wild-card of the film and nearly threatens to steal the show in one of his most intense performances. The script, based off the Blatty's novel, ""Legion,"" is hardly a re-hash of the first film, and compared to other sequels from its era, is quite a refreshing change of pace as an intelligent and classy picture in its own right. The gore and special effects are kept to a minimum, as the movie is just as much about its characters and dialogue as it is about its horrors.

The film's not without its faults, of course. Take the tacked-on ending that reeks of studio interference, for example. Blatty's battles with producer James G. Robinson (who had nothing to do with the original film in the first place) result in an intelligent horror movie/sequel that simply doesn't know how to end itself. It's as if someone was standing there saying: ""This is fine and all, but we need an exorcism scene!"" and voila! While it results in a rather gruesome and exciting special effects opportunity, the man-sticking-to-the-ceiling bit feels out of place with the tone of the rest of the film, which for the most part, keeps things cerebral and tasteful. This little bit felt like something you'd see in a ""Hellraiser"" flick, not that there's anything wrong with that. As for Patrick Ewing playing the Angel of Death in a dream sequence? Don't even get me started. Heck, even an appearance by Fabio seems bound and determined to rain on a decent parade.

In the end, ""The Exorcist III"" is a solid sequel that falls short of greatness. Its creativity and inventiveness is undermined by the insistence on re-introducing elements from the original film for nothing other than keeping with the namesake. Fans who felt themselves left in the cold by ""The Exorcist II"" will find this a treat, as will anyone else who loves an intelligent horror/thriller. Despite its flaws and the fact that it effectively killed off the franchise (was it ever meant to be?)

1260705,4,B0000399W9,"Most people, myself included, consider this the ""legitimate"" sequel to the original Exorcist: it was written by the same author, and picks up the story 15 years later.

There's some great dialogue, and George C. Scott does a top-notch job of selling his character to the audience. Brad Dourff also does a great job as a wacked-out serial killer.

Unfortunately, the last 10 to 15 minutes of this film is a jumbled mess. Supposedly that was the studio's fault in terms of massive re-editing. It can definitely be a speed bump to enjoyment, as everything preceding it was so powerfully presented and paced. Most people can get past that, though, and certainly the film is a ""sum of the parts is greater than the whole"" type of thing.

The DVD itself is bare-bones, and one of the most noticeable things lacking are any deleted scenes from what author/director Blatty had originally intended before studio suits mangled the ending. Supposedly that footage is now ""lost"" (IMDb mentioned in it's 'trivia' that Blatty had wanted to compose a ""director's cut"" but can't due to the footage being MIA.)

This film, with a good script by Blatty, great performances and good special effects is really the only sequel.  The ideas behind it were all solid and something to base a movie on.  Interesting from start to finish.

I saw this film with a movie friend (another horror film buff) when it first opened in 1990 and we both agreed that the mood and timing were excellent and very frightening.  Final moments of special effects were a little over the top, but overall this movie was good.

The most well timed and frightening scene was the sudden appearance of the ""killer"" in the hospital corridor behind the nurse.  This apparition was wrapped in bandages from head to foot and the last thing the audience expected.

Sadly there is no Linda Blair present, but there is a great cameo from a main character from the first film.

1260730,4,B0000399W9,"William Peter Blatty's ""The Exorcist III"" remains the true sequel to the popular novel and film ""The Exorcist."" Based on his book Legion, Blatty's screenplay is chilling and methodically paced. When released to theatres in 1991, the film fell flat, and I think it was grossly overlooked because of its pacing. Blatty had a wonderful vision for his film, but I sense this film was directed by a novelist. While this is not necessarily a negative aspect, it does change the film's pacing. And it should also be noted that the original film was shown to audiences in 1973, and the style of filmmaking had changed dramtically in the eighteen years between these films. Had this film been released in 1977, as was ""The Exorcist II: The Heretic"", it would have had an entirely different reception. Despite the film's eerie premise, it doesn't attack viewers with a cheap thrill. Much like the first film, directed by William Friedkin, ""The Exorcist III"" assaults you psychologically, which ultimately proves to be more frightening than an abundance of blood and guts. Also akin to the first film, this is an intelligently crafted horror film; it requires viewers to identify with the characters and become absorbded in the atmosphere.

George C. Scott assumes the role of Bill Kinderman (played brilliantly by Lee J. Cobb in ""The Exorcist""). Scott does an almost equally fantastic job here. I've always enjoyed Scott's performances, from Patton to a haunted muscian in ""The Changeling."" I wish he had offered his talents to more films in the horror genre. Brad Dourif is also spectacular as the man seemingly possessed with the same spirit that once haunted the little girl. His scenes with Scott are certainly chilling and worthy of the film's well crafted script. I also welcomed the cameo by Jason Miller, which provided a sense of authenticity to the overall feel.

In truth, no horror sequel (and perhaps no film in any genre) will ever be able to achieve the sheer level of fright of ""The Exorcist."" Perhaps any effort of expansion, as we've seen in recent years with attempted prequels, will always be compared to Freidkin's masterpiece of psychological terror...and they will fail miserably. At least Blatty assembled a credible cast and put forth a convincing effort, with ""The Exorcist III"", and I believe the film has aged quite well. Watch the original and then this film.

Recently, I wanted to watch it again since I kind of forgot it and found that it did genuinely creep me out. Not wanting to see the much-maligned sequel and hearing good things about the third one, I thought I'd check it out. Aside from a couple of notable scenes, I felt as a film in and of itself it was only half as successful and the sum did not equal the parts.

Detective Bill Kinderman has been investigating a number of gruesome deaths with religious significance. His search leads him to a hospital where a patient has been locked up for 15 years; that of Father Damien Karras, the priest who tried to exorcise the demons within Regan MacNeil from the original. Turns out Karras has been embodied with the spirit of the Gemini Killer a.k.a James Venamun, a particularly nasty murderer put to death many years ago. With the body count rising, Kinderman has to figure out how to rid himself of Venamun through different methods.

Ever watch a movie where it has that one awesome scene everyone talks about yet the film as a whole gets little mention? In a way, this film is similar in that ask people what their favorite seat-jumping moment in film was and among Alien's chestburster and the head-in-the-boat from Jaws, people will likely include ""the hallway scene"" from this film. While it's a great example of tension and great sense of control in not getting overly flashy, it also kind of shows how little else the film doesn't have. It's a very talky film and it's not really one that has a foreboding atmosphere about it but then others said it was totally creepy so what do I know?

As for the acting, it's lead by George C. Scott and as you can probably guess, he's kind of a yeller. It's not a bad performance and it's well-done considering he's such a seasoned actor. We also have the creepy Brad Dourif playing Venamun and he's one of those kind of actors where he's probably nice guy off-screen but the right kind of role and he can get stuck in your head. Watch for a scene where he describes his uses for a head and the almost glee he takes from telling his methods. As for everyone else, they're largely forgettable and not really worth noting.

Is it one of horror's most underrated films? Sure but underrated doesn't necessarily mean it's the best. It just means it didn't get as much recognition as it should've gotten but it's a fine film and certainly better than Heretic but as it is, it's just simply an alright film.",1186876800,,2617,4.480083857442348

It takes place fifteen years after The Exorcist ended. The evil has not finished what it began.

What we have here is good acting, script, dialogue, imagery, sound design, cinematography... not to mention its creepiness factor; the hair on my neck stands up. And there's comedy sprinkled here and there, particularly the witty dialogue between the cop and the priest. Their friendship/rapport is done really well and believably.

And there's that scene in the hospital that always, always makes you jump. Dead silence, no background music to distract you.  Until you let your guard down. Very Hitchockian, giving you a big scare that really isn't scary after all, and then moments later, the big genuine fright just as you're starting to relax and you don't expect it. Good stuff.
Oh, and if you blink you'll miss the king of chitchat, Larry King, at the restaurant. It's a one second shot of him. There are a few familiar faces around this film.

There are odd characters in this film, like the nurse with the heavy lipstick, and the chainsmoking doctor who rehearses his conversations. It feels like a David Lynch film sometimes.

1260734,4,B0000399W9,"I would say that the real star of this production is the sound design.  Surely such is lost on a playing through an ordinary TV with its own speakers, but play it through a good surround system with decent bass response and the nearly subsonic rumble throughout will have viewers on the edges of their seats.

Additionally, being a DC native and still resident, I found the location shots particularly gratifying. I am very familiar with the boathouse where they found the first young victim.

The scene where Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer went to a movie was filmed in the lobby of what was once a lovely small cinema on M Street. It was called the Biograph, and one could always count on the Biograph to present films that were otherwise out of circulation.  Not only that, but they offered a variety of seasoned salt for the popcorn. Sadly, that location is now what too many other neighborhood theaters have become...another CVS!

One half-star may be subtracted for the final chase scene through Georgetown to reach the home of the last victim.  It seems the film makers went way, way all around Nelly's barn to get to where the heroes were going.

I know cab drivers, trying to cover as many zones as possible (DC uses zones instead of meters) who will still drive a route economically convenient to the customer to reach a final destination. lol

At any rate, if you want a good goose bump flick, treat yourself to a rental of this one.

But in 1990, William Peter Blatty, the original creator of THE EXORCIST (who wrote the horrific novel in 1971, leading him into writing the first film's screenplay) wound up directing and writing, THE EXORCIST III, the third installment based on his best-selling novel, LEGION.

LT. WILLIAM ""BILL"" KINDERMAN (played by George C. Scott, taking over for the late Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the deaths of a young African-American boy and a local priest. The deaths appear to be the work of the Gemini Killer. But the Gemini Killer is dead. He had died in the electric chair at the exact moment of Father Karras' plunge.

  Bill is still very good friends with FATHER JOSEPH DYER (played by Ed Flanders), the priest who had been friends with the late Father Karras. Father Dyer is in the hospital for some unknown reason, but the next morning, it is found that Father Dyer has been murdered: decaptitated, blood drained (without a single drop anywhere in his room), index finger on his right hand severed, complete with the Gemini marking on the palm of his left hand: the same state the other two victims were left in.

  Bill searches the hospital, looking for answers, where enters the ""Disturbed Ward"". He looks in on the patient in cell number 11. He goes on in to find that the patient in cell 11 is...FATHER DAMIEN KARRAS (again played by the late Jason Miller). How can this be? Father Karras died during Regan MacNeil's exorcism, along with Father Lankester Merrin. Karras says that he is not Karras, for he his the Gemini Killer. Seems as though that the Gemini Killer took possession of Karras when the two died at the same time. During the meetings, the GEMINI KILLER (played by Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky, the killer doll), is shown to give us a view of what he really looked like.

  Bill begins investigating everything from top to bottom, after another killing is made at the hospital. At his second meeting with Karras, Bill asks him how he is able to get out of the cell and committ all of these murders. Karras claims he gets around with his ""old friends"", that he's a traveling man. He meant that he possesses the catatonic patients. One of which is an elderly, seemingly creepy old lady. That day, the lady sneaks out of the hospital in a nurse's uniform and heads over to Bill's house. She is now under demonic possession. Possessing her is the Gemini killer. Bill gets there in time to save his wife and daughter from the possessed lady. At the same time, FATHER PAUL MORNING (played by Nicol Williamson) arrives to perform an exorcism on Karras. But how is that possible when the Gemini Killer is not in Karras' body at the moment? Well, unfortunately, Karras is under the possession of two spirits. The first, as we already know, is the spirit of the Gemini Killer. The second is...the Devil, who had possessed Regan in the first film, when he began beating her, telling the demon to enter Karras' body. And it did, and never left. The Gemini Killer has returned to join the demon in Karras' body, where Father Morning congtinues on with the exorcism, but Karras levitates Father Morning's body to the ceiling of the cell, where he rips Father Morning's back right off in a bloody mess.

  Bill arrives and begins fighting for Damien, where he ends up on the wall through the demon's power. But he his strong belief is what helps Father Morning help Karras fight the demon, where Karras, through a strong fight, calls out to Bill to, ""Kill me now, Bill! Do it now!"". He shoots Karras three times in the chest. Karras, barely alive now, tells him, ""Please, Bill. Free me"", to which Bill shoots him in the head, freeing him.

  We all know THE EXORCIST was horrifyingly scary. EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC was not scary at all, but rather a little creepy. THE EXORCIST III is the second most horrifying film in this franchise. It is definitely one of the best sequels to this whole series. A must-see for all EXORCIST fans.",1156464000,,4384,4.649417852522639

1260750,4,B0000399W9,"Unlike the first Exorcist and the useless Exorcist 2: The Heritic, Exorcist 3 envolves a serial killer who was executed the same night of the exorcism in the first film with the possessed girl Regan. The Jesuit priest (Karras) who was killed by falling down a flight of steps, has entered the spirit of the insane killer to slaughter victim after victim some 20 years later. The killer mutilates priests and doctors and uses an old women as a suspect. After the returning police detective Kinderman (played by George C. Scott) sees that it is the same serial killings of the Zodiac, he and another priest decide to find and destroy the killer's spirit with using the final exorcism. The exorcism in this one is much more dangerous and the evil spirit is more powerful than ever.

With brilliant acting, direction and pace, Exorcist 3 is a very enjoyable horror that is drenched in an evil atmosphere that is very creepy at times and delivers quite a few shocks and frights. I would say a lot of people would have found this scary as it is a pretty hardcore horror. Not by horrific content, but by scare and atmospheric content. This was said to be one of the greatest horrors of the 90's. I wouldn't disagree as the Exorcist 3 is a really surprisingly good horror.

1260752,4,B0000399W9,"William Peter Blatty adapted his novel and directed the film version of the second sequel to his blockbuster hit. Fifteen years later, Lt. William F. Kinderman (played here by George C. Scott, RIP) is still haunted by the tragic, mysterious death of his friend, Father Damien Karras (the the late Jason Miller, back in fine form). Then a grisly string of murders he investigates seems strangely connected with a case he worked several years previously. The culprit was the Gemini Killer, and Kinderman is informed that a patient in the psychiatric ward of the local hospital is claiming responsibility for the crimes. The detective decides to confront the patient, but he knows it's impossible for this person to be the Gemini - the murderer was executed in the electric chair - on the very night that Father Karras successfully expelled the demon in the first film.

Kinderman is in no way prepared for what he is about to face - evil wearing the face of his old friend, the priest's soul being tormented for the devil's pleasure - and a bloody rampage that claims the life of another friend, Father Joesph Dyer (Ed Flanders, RIP). Braving the supernatural force, the detective must face his worst foe to end the crime spree and free his friend's soul . . . . . .

Blatty wisely did not try to top his original masterpiece; instead, he presents a portrait of a few of his key characters engaged in their own battles and trying to contemplate the meaning of life and death in general, all the while incorporated the supernatural to reach the point. The movie seems to have a more significant meaning since many of the top billed cast members have now passed on. Understandably, the film did not do well at the box office due to the previous sequel's disaster, but LEGION is an underrated gem. If you have seen the first film, you might like to see this one.

1260754,5,B0000399W9,"Yes, yes, this certainly isn't much like the original 'The Exorcist'. (Nor is it like that spectacular turdburger 'The Heretic'.)  If you want 'The Exorcist' maybe you should go watch that again.  Personally, I like this movie better than the original, though they aren't all that comparable, and it's certainly one of the best horror movies of the 1990's.

This takes something more of a thriller approach, as it focuses on a policeman, Kinderman, played by George C. Scott, and a murder investigation.  Still, it has a substantial supernatural angle and is undeniably a horror film.  Most backers of this film call it a 'cerebral horror film'.  I think that's a bit pretentious as it isn't really that this film is that smart, it's just slow and emphasizes dialogue.  It's not so much smart as it is not merely shallow and extremely simplistic.  Some dumb people may not care for it, but that would just be because they don't like something so low-key, rather than that they can't understand it.  Anyway the film involves a series of brutal murders which are especially puzzling as they follow the MO of a killer who's been dead for over a decade, though they don't appear nearly as random as those did, and seem to be related to an exorcism many years earlier.  Specifics beyond that are unnecessary.

Again, this is just the scariest film I've seen in a very long time.  I've grown largely immune to film horror, though I enjoy it immensely, but this film got to me.  It's not scary in the purely conventional sense as it is the dialogue scenes which tend to be the most unnerving parts.  Brad Dourif plays the apparent killer, and he's brilliant with lots of magnificent dialogue.  He's plays it about as intensely as you can with out going overboard and is really quite frightening.  Unquestionably the creepiest 'movie psycho' I've ever seen.  The generally low-key style of the film is broken at a few points, and these scenes are all the more effective because of how rare they are. (Up until the very end of the film, anyway)

George C. Scott is excellent as Kinderman, and the performances are uniformly strong, though there aren't many really substantiative parts.  It is, of course, a dark, dank film but with a bit of visual flair at times as well, particularly during a fine, surreal sequence towards the beginning of the film.  Again, it is slow, but that's the stuff that this film is about.  Take it or leave it.

It does break the mood a bit at the end, which is quite a bit more conventional than all that which came before.  It doesn't fit entirely but it's far from bad.  It's still pretty effective all by itself, I think, just not as strong as that which came before.  All in all, it doesn't stumble too much.

Well, I liked this a lot.  Check it out if you want some truly dark, different horror.

Grade: A-",1133049600,,2832,4.61
1260755,3,B0000399W9,"As one reviewer put it, this is the true sequel to the Exorcist and after watching the disaster of a film Exorcist II: Heretic I almost chose not to view this one. William Peter Blatty returned to the project which is based off the novel called 'Legion'. For those of you who have read any of the first four books in the New Testament of the Bible know who are what Legion is. Well, even if you haven't you will know after you watch this movie. Exorcist 3 takes place right after the original though it is 15 years later. I'm guessing the Exorcist timeline goes from 1940 - 1990. Luckily, you can skip the previous inferrior exorcist sequel because this one ignores it. Though played by different actors, three of the original characters are back in this movie. The detective is back and the story revolves mainly around him. The priest who sent Father Damien Kerris to help Regan returns and has more of a part in this movie. As for the thrid character, you will have to watch it for yourself. Unlike the other exorcist films, this one doesn't start off slow. It doesn't get too horrific until the end though there are some violent scenes throughout the movie. Exorcist 3 or Legion if you will wraps up the exorcist series by revealing the demon's purpose for his posessions. As for the dvd, there are no features to speak of which is typical of B-flicks.",1132963200,,1356,4.493927125506073

It is a genuinely creepy sequel to the original - I never knew how the two coincided, but upon finding out I was pleasently shocked.

Recently, before I sat down to watch it, the film came up in  two seperate conversations with two friends that do not know each other.  They both metioned the nurse's demise by the shears.  I thought, ""I need to see this film"", and looked for it used in a second hand store...Bingo!

I personally think this is a good solid film.  Great acting by George C. Scott(always like his acting), Brad Dourif is just insane! Vivica Lindfors is creepy, and don't forget the cameos: Samuel L.Jackson, Patrick Ewing and Fabio.

Creepy, atmospheric, and a good audio trip, too. I highly recommend this thriller to all those who have not experienced it before.  Heed not the naysayers!",1132272000,,961,4.56140350877193
1260757,4,B0000399W9,"When THE EXORCIST came out in 1973, it was a big box-office success, and the reactions were outrageous. But the sequel was anything but a success. Although still entertaining, EXORCIST II: The Heretic was a financial and critical disaster. Many ignored the film and so it was thought that the EXORCIST series would not rise from the ashes again. But William Peter Blatty had other idea when he completed his new novel, LEGION. Morgan Creek Productions picked him up, and THE EXORCIST III was in production. It was released and did better at the box office and got more positive reviews than its predecessor.

We pick up with a series of murders being committed, and once again Lt. Kinderman (George C. Scott) is on the trail of the individual known as the Gemini killer. This killer was believed to have been shot dead after his capture fifteen years prior, but with the murders resurfacing, Kinderman has a hunch that he's still up to his old tricks again. We are also introduced to a hospital with a range of patients with different problems both psychological and physical. One of the best has to be the old lady who crawls on the ceiling during her ""possessed"" moments. Another involves a poor nurse whose head is offed after she leaves a room and a mysterious figure in white follows with a sword...you don't see the actual head cutting but you know from the angle and execution. We also have a most bizarre appearance from Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) who also doubles as the Gemimi killer (played by Brad Dourif). The conversations between Kinderman and Karras/Gemini are somewhat chilling but inviting you in to listen to the madman's story. As the murders continue, Kinderman is forced to take matters into his hands and posts security and officers everywhere in the building until the mystery of the killings has been unravelled. When the exorcism finally occurs in the movie, it's a bit uninspired and rather awkward instead of adding to the power of the film. It does take away, and leaves the ending open for mediocrity. However, the film itself is strong, with spirited performances from George Scott, Jason Miller, and Brad Dourif who is menacing in his role. The scenes of the supernatural are also startling, but the exorcism scene is not convincing...too bad, because it could have been more had thought been put into executing it in better form.

Overall, EXORCIST III feels like the true sequel to the original film, and not just merely the second sequel. With its sturdy cast, stronger script, and eerie sequences, EXORCIST III is stronger and more believable than The Heretic. If you're in the mood for an intelligent and chilling thriller, you should make it a point to rent (or in my case, own) this film.",1131840000,,2736,4.806794055201698

The characters were underdeveloped and completely uninteresting.  George C Scott spent a lot of time yelling but it came off as pointless noise.  The ""light hearted banter"" between Scott and his priest friend in the hospital seemed like it was written by a junior-high school student.  The plot was pathetic and the whole thing wasn't the least bit scary or even remotely entertaining.  This had absolutely none of the ambience or creepiness of the original.  The big exorcist scene at the end was so unimaginative, tired and stiff.  I would never recommend this loser to anyone.  I had a hard time believing that William Peter Blatty had ANYTHING to do with this, it was so poor.  The only thing even close to interesting in here were the scenes with Brad Dourif.",1130889600,,942,4.746913580246914
1260769,4,B0000399W9,"William Peter Blatty did it all his way in 'The Exorcist III.' Based on his novel 'Legion' Peter produced, directed and adapted the screenplay. An amazing undertaking and it paid off. In the third edition of 'The Exorcist' saga Pazuzu and his Legion of demons have returned to reek havoc in Georgetown, Washington once again. This time with the help of the spirit of the recently executed Gemini Killer (Brad Dourif). Angry over there expulsion from little Reagan in the first film, the demonic forces decide to possess Father Karras (Jason Miller) at the moment of his death. His body re-animates and poor Karras is trapped inside with a host of demons and the serial killer.

Soon a series of grotesque murders begin to take place and police Lt. Kinderman (George C. Scott) is put on the case. At first they appear to be copycat killings based on murders committed fifteen years earlier. However the overtly satanic nature of these crimes soon point to forces beyond the human realm.

Oddly enough Lt. Kinderman just happened to be a close friend of the supposedly deceased Father Karras. Eventually the ghastly trail of clues lead to a psychiatric ward at a local hospital and it is there that Kinderman comes face to face with the demonically possessed killer. Imagine his surprise when he looks into the face of his old friend Father Karras.

[Note: This probably sounds a little confusing, so let me clarify. Since Father Karras is possessed by the spirit of the Gemini Killer you have two people playing the same role (Miller and Dourif). When the serial killer is speaking Dourif is on-screen, when the Father is speaking you see Jason Miller].

A little slow but stay with it, the dialogue between the demonically possessed Brad Dourif and George C. Scott is fantastic. This film really belongs to Brad Dourif, he literally turns 'The Exorcist III' into a one-man-show. Really one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.

The story takes place about 15 years after the original. A serial killer seems to be on the loose again. The problem is that the killer was executed 15 years before. George C. Scott plays a police officer tasked with tracking down the killer and his search leads him to a mental hospital. There he finds Fr. Damien from the original locked up as a patient and the bodies continue to pile up.

This relase is much more contemplative and talktive than the first two. Most of the story comes out through conversation instead of action. This does not prevent the occasional chilling moment but it is definitely not a slasher movie.

The ""orthodoxy"" of this film is much more in keeping with the first and with reality as well. There is none of the animistic religion which so pervades the second. In this one, the concept of demonic possesion by proxy is examined with chilling effect.

1260799,5,B0000399W9,"This may be idiosyncratic on my part, but I've seen ""The Exorcist III"" dozens of times and consider it a cult classic. The mood of the film is nearly overpowering from the beginning dream sequence to the somewhat overdone end. It is philosophical, filled with unpredictable twists and turns (and three powerhouse performances from Ed Flanders, the ever-nutty Brad Douriff, and the wonderfully cranky George C. Scott). Some of the religious symbolism is overdone, some of the dialogue absurd (""What do I care about possession? I'm just trying to get kids into college."" This from a priest drinking scotch), and if we were to characterize it in a negative way it would be quirky. But Scott's performance as Kinderman and Douriff as ""The Gemini Killer"" more than compensate for the dragging parts. From the outset we are convinced that Kinderman is a man living in the shadow of an unspeakably evil and mysterious event. (Jason Miller does not make this movie. His appearance must have appeased the hardcore ""Exorcist"" fans. The exorcism scene at the end is horrendous.) While it doesn't equal the original, this is a film which has not gotten it's just desserts.

This movie really surprised me. Its more of a pschological serial killer thriller than horror, but the horror elements are blended in perfectly. It's like The Silence of the Lambs meets The Exorcist. Brad Durif is awesome as the Gemini Killer, he's so slimy and creepy. George C. Scott was... well, George C. Scott. Which isn't a bad thing, but he seemed a little bland by the end of the movie. There were quite a few cameos as well, even Patrick Ewing showed up, no mid-range jumpers though, sorry Knicks fans. The killer's MO is very cool even when compared to thrillers of today. There are some truely creepy if not damn scary scenes. Especially that hospital scene. The ending dissapoints which is pretty sad considering the rest of the movie was actually good.

1260801,3,B0000399W9,"I really tried hard to find something--anything--to push this film over into the 4 star territory, but I just could not do it. That would be dishonest of me to give the impression that it was of film of such classic status.
Don't get me wrong, this is definitely a worthwhile movie and not a waste of time to watch by any means. Blatty's directing is very unique and at times extremely artistic in its creepiness. He is incredibly talented at creating an eerie vibe by using bizarre camera shots and borderline psychedelia, and personally I think he should have directed more horror films. The story, within the world of the Exorcist films, is believable and not necessarily a ""roll your eyes in disbelief"" kind of plot. Bringing back Jason Miller lends credibility to it that may not have been given otherwise.
My only gripes are the confused acting of George C. Scott--not his typical kind of role and I just don't see him meshing with the strange behavior of Kinderman all that well--and the extraordinary amount of dialogue. Blatty likes to really bash us over the head with conversations, especially between Scott and Brad Dourif. These seemingly endless rantings get very tiresome after the first five minutes of sitting there watching these guys go back and forth, not to mention having to deal with Dourif's constant overacting. Blatty wants us to know just how clever he can be (as well as how nonsensical he can be, considering some of Scott's lines), but this is overkill.
Aside from those points, it is certainly a very visually enthralling film. I remember reading about TE3 in Fangoria before it came out and, upon seeing the final product, noticed that some of the gorier scenes--which had clearly been filmed--were left out. One scene I recall from a photo in the magazine showed the priest in the confessional holding his head in his lap after the old lady got to him. Removing that was probably a good decision since this sort of film leaves the horror to your own imagination rather than shoving it in your face.",1087171200,,2031,4.756373937677054

Directed and written by William Peter Blatty, whom also wrote the novel, Legion (1983).
Third movie in the series.
 THIS FILM IS VERY INTENSE!  NOT FOR CHILDREN!  NOT FOR ADULTS WITH HEART PROBLEMS.

Returning: Jason Miller, who played ""Father Karras"" in the first film, The Exorcist (1973).

George C. Scott is now in the role of ""Lt. Kinderman"", played by Lee J. Cobb in The Exorcist (1973). Cobb died in 1976.

Ed Flanders is now in the role of ""Father Dyer"", played by William O'Malley in The Exorcist (1973).

In Georgetown, Father Dyer (Ed Flanders) takes a look at the steps that killed his friend Father Karras (Jason Miller) 15 years ago. Also this morning, Lt. Kinderman (George C. Scott) is in his home remembering Father Karras.
  On this day, Father Dyer and Kinderman usually go to the movies together to cheer each other up. Today, they will see It's A Wonderful Life (1946).  After the matinee, Kinderman tells Father Dyer what has been bothering him. There is a serial killer out there much like ""The Gemini Killer"" they killed 15 years ago.  This serial killer matches the same M.O. as ""The Gemini Killer"", but certain facts were kept private only Lt. Kinderman and Homicide knew. Facts that were never printed in the newspapers correctly. This killer has some kind of religious connection when he kills.

 Keep your dogs and cats out of the room.  Sound effects could cause heart stoppage.

Also in the cast: Zohra Lampert, George DiCenzo, Grand L. Bush, C. Everett Koop, Larry King, Samuel L. Jackson, Fabio, Harry Carey Jr, Mary Jackson, Brad Dourif, Viveca Lindfors.
Colleen Dewhurst is the voice of Satan killing ""Father Kanavan"". She was married to George C. Scott.

1260804,3,B0000399W9,"This movie centres on Bill Kinderman, the amiable cop who features in the original movie (but replacing Lee J. Cobb with George C. Scott.) It's fifteen years after the strange events at the McNeil house. Fifteen years too after the execution of the insane ""Gemini Killer"". But now there is a new series of gruesome murders, one that recalls the Gemini killings. And something very strange is going on: the fingerprints from these new crimes fail to match up, suggesting that they are not the work of a single killer. And there is someone a bit queer and unpleasant in Room 11 of the high security disturbed ward down at the hospital, someone who looks remarkably like the supposedly late Damien Karras, who before his supposed death was a longstanding close friend of Kinderman's. (Actually it's clear enough from the first movie that he was no such thing, just one of a number of out and out inconsistencies between 1 and 3 that seem faintly surprising given Blatty's authorship of both.)
This time indeed Blatty is auteur as well as author, taking over as director from Friedkin. He's not too bad for a beginner and can certainly do suspense. But there's a general sense of a writer being let off the leash and being a trifle self-indulgent. It's certainly all a bit too self-consciously literary for a horror movie. Thus in the first 15 minutes or so: we have a conversation between Kinderman and his police colleagues that is, for cop-talk, rather improbably peppered with allusions to `MacBeth', `Lord Jim' etc., as if Blatty were just desperate to show us, through Kinderman, just what an educated fellow he is; we have an, again rather self-consciously literary, visit to the realms of Kinderman's neuroses as he expands to his friend Father Dyer (Ed Flanders) about his terror of the carp back home in his bathtub; and we have a long conversation between Kinderman and Dyer about the Problem of Evil. Then, just as we are about to get really cross with Blatty, we have a dark and violent scene in a confessional box which is one of the most splendidly creepy and disturbing scenes in any modern American horror movie. Things seem to be looking up...
This mixture of occasional inspiration and a certain flatfootedness characterizes the whole film. Generally, it's a nice effective scary movie, though it's marred by some very significant flaws. (So it really is a battle between good and evil!) We could start with the title. There are more imaginative ways of naming sequels than simply II, III, etc. And `Exorcist III' suggests that we are getting a sequel to `Exorcist II'. Which happily we are not, as Blatty wisely simply ignores that rather silly (even by John Boorman standards!) film.  Indeed I suspect he should have eschewed not only the `III' but the `Exorcist'. The connections with the earlier film are really pretty tenuous and contrived and Blatty would almost certainly have made a better (if less easily marketed!) film just by making this a free-standing new story. All this really has almost nothing to do with Regan McNeil and everything to do with the Gemini Killer. And indeed the determination to tie these things together leads to a certain absurdity as Karras's possession starts to seem a bit overdetermined: he seems to be possessed by the Gemini who is in turn possessed by the Demon from the first movie; metapossessed, as it were! And the Gemini seems not to be all that possessed, speaking very much in his own voice, far from buried like Regan before and Karras now, under the demonic persona. And why has the Demon bothered to possess Karras this complicated way dragging in this third party? We are told he wants to have revenge on Karras by having his body possessed by someone truly evil. But that explains nothing: as if the Demon wasn't evil enough in his own right. All this is just necessarily untidy. Then the scenes in the second half in room 11 where the Demon is faced down were presumably intended to recreate all the disturbing intensity of the parallel scenes  in Regan's bedroom in EI. Which they don't: they are the lest effective part of the film. Partly again, this is Blatty getting carried away. Brad Dourif's Gemini is way too verbal; he explains himself far too much - unlike the original demon who explained nothing - and he ends up becoming unmysterious, not terribly scary and something of a bore. Indeed this general literary over-doing it remains pervasive: the Demon, on his very first appearance, has, quite unnecessarily, to quote a dirty great chunk of Donne at us.
If these scenes are the weakest bits, the strongest are mainly to be found in the first hour or so and far away from the fateful room 11. In this movie, the Demon is mobile, has found a way to get out and about, and consequently Blatty tries to convey in many of these early scenes a disturbing sense of unseen malign presence. This he does with great success and genuinely creepy results. Which makes this, at least some of the time, an interesting and worthwhile horror movie, even if, ultimately, it's more a movie with some great moments than anything like a great movie.",1076371200,,5113,4.756756756756757
1260805,5,B0000399W9,"To start off with, this movie should have been called "" Legion "" not "" Exorcist 3 ""; obviously, Mr. William Peter Blatty { in a director debut nothing short of astonishing } was under some studio pressure to sell the movie as a sequel to attract mviegoers. "" Legion "" is a continuation of Det. Kinderman---played wonderfully and world weary by the magnificant George C. Scott---dealing with grisly murders that AT FIRST appear to be the work of a copycat of the ruthless and evil "" Gemmini Killer ""
James Venemin. But later on Kinderman gets more than he ever bargined for: following the murder of his friend Father Dyer who is admitted into a hospital { a gruesome one that appears to be the work of the killer Kinderman is after }, the detective is blown away to find in a "" isolation tank "" in the psyche ward of the hospital...Father Karras! But Father Karras is claiming to be James Venimen , who appears often to the viewer as a particular psychopathic Brad Douriff { who is iddeally evil here playing the role with satanic glee }!
This movie contains very little gore; is thought provoking, atmospheric and VERY scary. And seeing the "" Exorcist "" s 1 or 2 is completly uneccesary to understand it and to enjoy this movie which deals with the evils of Man, as one reviewer said befor, the silence of God, demons both figuritively and literly, and most compelling, Kinderman's stuggling faith.

1260815,4,B0000399W9,"Exorcist writer William Peter Blatty adapted his novel Legion, an honest attempt to further study the nature of faith as well as good and evil, and, thankfully, he managed to capture some of the novel's powerful concept.  There is also several good seat jumping moments sprinkled throughout what is essentially a character driven story.  Until the end, when the special effect exorcism takes over.  That part isn't in the book, if I'm recalling it correctly, and it cheapens the over all feel of the movie.  Nonetheless, this is an intelligent thriller that wants to do more than just shock and scare you.  Highly recommended.",1069372800,,626,4.980769230769231
1260816,5,B0000399W9,"Let's break out the Holy Water and crucifix, don our sacred vestments, run through the Liturgy of Exorcism, and get medieval on ""Exorcist 3: Legion"": is this a movie worthy of carrying the mantle of what many call the scariest movie ever made, or does it cry out to be exorcised of cinematic mediocrity?
Fear not: ""Exorcist 3"" is a lush and haunting creepshow that boasts original ""Exorcist"" author William Peter Blatty in the director's chair, crisp cinematography by Gerry Fisher (""Highlander"", ""Wolfen""), and a spooky score that knows when to get low-key. Add to that George C. Scott in the role of Detective Lt. Bill Kinderman, a crusty cinephile brought back to those wickedly steep Georgetown steps when a serial killer slaughters and mutilates two priests and a young boy---brutal killings that are particularly baffling when police recognize the brutal signature of the infamous Gemini Killer---but the Killer died 15 years ago, and the fingerprints suggest the murders were carried out by three separate killers.
Blatty's direction and a fine ensemble cast makes ""Exorcist 3"" a worthy successor to the original which manages to bury the silliness of ""Exorcist2"",  and best of all the film ratchets up the terror. ""Exorcist3"" is not afraid to take chances, and while not the grand opera that Friedkin's original is, for my money it is far more terrifying and infinitely creepier.
This time the Devil is finished messing around with random adolescents and has decided instead to launch a blitzkrieg against the morally weak and feeble minded. The mixture of forensic weirdness and supernatural strangeness brings Kinderman back together with old friend Father Dyer (the society priest from the original, now contrite and played effectively by Ed Flanders), and by the time the credits roll even Father Damien Karras has put in an appearance, joining Old Scratch to make ""Exorcist 3: Legion"" a reunion of sorts!
""Exorcist 3"" is monstrously entertaining and genuinely scary. Blatty has a remarkable flair for taking his well-crafted set-pieces and milking them for every ounce of spooky atmosphere: from Kinderman's audience in a Bishop's shadowy office, to the antiseptic cell-block housing a mysterious lunatic, to a hospital wing which features one of the most terrifying sequences in movie history, Blatty is in total control of his medium, using sound effects, actors' faces, and the film's lurking and creepy soundtrack to crank up the terror.
And you get so many other fine little nuggets here, including: a typically tasty turn by the great Brad Dourif as the Gemini Killer; cameos by Fabio Volpe, Samuel L. Jackson, and even former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop; Colleen Dewhurst as the strangled voice of Satan; and a painful scene in which a Catholic priest is turned into a human refrigerator magnet. Ouch!
Like its worthy predecessor ""The Exorcist"", ""Exorcist 3"" is a superbly directed spookshow about modern men wrestling with the silence of God, mortal terror, and the problem of Evil. But unlike Friedkin's original, Blatty seems less concerned with bile and gore, and far more interested in figuring out what happens when Man stares too long into the face of Evil. There are fates worse than Death.",1067731200,,3222,5.1254752851711025
1260817,4,B0000399W9,"William Peter Blatty wrote a book called The Exorcist, which was published in 1971 and quickly became a best seller of historic proportions.  Never before had the public read such horrible and sexually explicit material - and about a child possessed by the devil.
Hollywood quickly optioned the book, and the result was the William Friedkin directed masterpiece, ""The Exoricst.""  The film went on to win critical and popular acclaim.  In the theater, people fainted and vomited as a result of the horrors they saw on the screen.  Because of a scene in the film, a new color was named:  Linda Blair green (the young actress who portrayed the possessed child).
The film became so wildly successful that for a time it had the distinction of having the most successful boxoffice of any film in history.  It was only a matter of time before Hollywood cranked out a sequel.
The result was ""The Exorcist II:  The Heretic"".  This film was created completely by screenwriters and producers with an eye for dollars and with no attention to the subject matter.  Most of the principle actors from the first film passed this time around and those that remained were sorry they had.  The Exorcist II:  The Heretic is often thought of as one of the worst films in history.
While Hollywood was screwing around with characters he had created, William Peter Blatty was busy writing the real sequel to his original book.  It was called ""Legion"" (some places called it The Exorcist III, but since it was a book sequel, this is incorrect).
Hollywood then optioned this film, and Blatty held firm and decided that he would make the movie himself, to protect his property.  He was right to have done so.
The film:  The Exorcist III: Legion, is a tight, psychological thriller that picks up a few years after the events of the original book (and the original movie).  Regan is gone and the film centers on Detective Kinderman (George C. Scott).  He has the dubious task of dealing with a serial killer who is mimicking an executed serial killer with precision that only the real killer could know.  Kinderman soon discovers that a mysterious patient in the criminal ward of the insane asylum may hold the secret to who is really killing these people.  What happens next is nothing short of amazing.  It further ties this film to the first and the characters as well.
This movie is big on mood, lighting, visuals, and character.  In short, it's really quite good.  It's never very gory, though many gory things take place - just off screen.  Some of the most frightening scenes that take place are filled with utter silence on screen and in the most docile of places.  You will find yourself jumping and squealing as events unfold before you.  This is a very well crafted horror film.
I encourage you to take a look at this film and forget that there ever was an Exorcist II:  The Heretic.  The Exorcist III: Legion is the real owner of that title.",1067385600,,2923,4.682352941176471
1260818,4,B0000399W9,"I'll be honest, I had ZERO expectations for this film.  The second film the series was perhaps the most God awful film I've had the displeasure of sitting through.  Then when this one came to theaters, it bombed both critcally and financially.  Now, with the fourth one on the horizon, I thought I'd go back and catch up by watching this one.  I have to say, I was totally taken aback after viewing this film.  It was the first film to give me the chills in over fifteen years (and I've sat through more horror films than most die hard horror fans).
  One scene in particular (one I wouldn't dream of giving away), completely caught me off guard with it's use of subtlety and eerie sound effects.  There is little on screen gore, as William Peter Blatty (writer/director) has his characters describe everything in  great detail through the dialouge.  This leaves most of it to your imagination, which tends to be more horrific in the long run.  Save for a few really chilling close ups, the direction is pretty straight forward.  Most of it is of the point and shoot variety, which really disarms the viewer when Blatty decides to lay on the scares.
  The acting also suprised me with George C. Scott turning in an emotional performance (slightly over played, but that's always been his style).  The real show stopper would have to be Brad (""Child's Play"")Dourif, playing yet another psychopath with his usual brilliance.  The interplay between him and Scott in the cell room came across very shudder-some.  It reminded me of the scenes with Foster and Hopkins in ""Silence of the Lambs"" (though one should point out this predated ""Silence"" by a year!).
  If I have any complaints, I suppose the climax would have to be it.  It's as if someone else came in and shot a different ending (which may the case for all I know).  It feels like your suddenly watching someone else's film right at the most crucial moment.  The other complaint would have to be the presentation on the DVD itself.  The picture is a little hazy and it's pretty much a ""bare bones"" package, with no real special features.
  That aside, this film is a definate must see for all those horror and mystery buffs who may have overlooked this gem back when it was first released.  Very smart thriller, which probably would've done better had it been released under the title ""Legion"" (the novel which it was based on, also written by Blatty), than as the third in the ""Exorcist"" series.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great follow up to ""The Exorcist"" and really the only sequel I would consider to it. But the film stands well on it's own and it's a shame so few ever gave it the time of day becuase of it's roman numeral in the title.",1060128000,,2701,4.549792531120332
1260819,5,B0000399W9,"This is the TRUE Exorcist sequel. They are both different from each other, but they still have something to link each other.

The Exorcist III However alloud the viewers mind to terrify them and threw in creepy and disturbing visuals. It added for of a mystery and humor to allieviate the suspense. That's good, cuz I don't think anyone could keep there sanity if something scarier than The Exorcist emerged. Anyway they both have a different approach, and while it is no where near as scary as the 1st, it is much MUCH better than The Exorcist II.

I agree with some of the latest reviews below: A special edition DVD with commentary from the director, Jason Miller, and Brad Dourif would be an excellent addition to a DVD collection (too bad we now can't get George C. Scott's two cents worth). The special edition could also be in TRUE WIDESCREEN, for this current DVD is not.

Its got such smart lighting, film shots, and great creepy sounds/noises that really add to the effect to keep you engrossed in the film.
Even the great dry humour in the film really adds to this experience.
Its unfortunate that the DVD is so bare bones and without any audio commentary. Hard core fans of this film have been waiting patiently for a quality DVD release of this film and it seems we will have to wait much longer.

1260822,5,B0000399W9,"I have to admit it: I love this movie even with the studio-imposed, tacked on ending. I saw this in an empty theater in '90 and I was mesmerized by all of the great scenes and atmosphere. Here in the director's chair, Blatty was free to inject his trademark humor as he saw fit, and it ably serves to facilitate concern for the characters. Fans of both of Blatty's demon novels should look closely for references to, and dialogue from, those previous works.  Come to think of it, few movies serve so well in really complimenting their literary counterparts.

A major theme people miss about this film, in my opinion, is the intentional low-key dynamic as opposed to the original, and that there's an interesting reason for it: The Exorcist was a story of how God works through people - even those of wavering faith - to deliver a possessed girl from a brutal demon. In Legion (Exorcist III), the demon takes revenge in a sort of travesty on how God works, by using a serial killer to possess the body of the priest who had delivered the girl. {To Kinderman}: ""Are you my son? You're not my son."" Legion  is, in one sense, a sort of inverse Exorcist.

Of course, what we're all clamoring for is a special release with Blatty's original cut of this movie, different ending and all. I hope the studio gets motivated enough to find it one day. But until then, you couldn't do much better with your film watching time than to sit down and enjoy this one. Reviewers rightly make much of the hospital scene, but my favorite is the murder in the confessional - possibly the most satisfying evil laugh I've heard.",1045180800,,1604,4.520689655172414
1260823,2,B0000399W9,"Though I liked the novel, I found THE EXORCIST to be more laughable than frightening. I didn't see the second movie, and popular opinion indicates that I am better off. However, since I had heard very good things about this third installment, and though it might not date as badly, I decided to rent it.
This story takes place fifteen years after the original film. Someone is murdering people in ways which emulate those of a serial killer who was executed years ago -- ways known only to the police who were on the case. Even though it seems impossible, one detective believes there is a connection not only to the earlier series of murders, but to the exorcism of young Regan McNeill fifteen years prior.
LEGION was written and directed by William Peter Blatty from his own novel. While the direction is often interesting the script and acting are often unintentionally funny. (Witness an early scene in which George C. Scott's character talks about a fish in his bathtub with deadly seriousness.) There is some great work from Brad Dourif, who plays a patient in the hospital's ""disturbed"" ward. But like most any other film that uses religious phenomena as its basis, it makes little sense in the end -- it's a hodgepodge of weird happenings and biblical nonsense that doesn't add up.  And why does the devil ever do any of the things he does, anyway?  Boredom?  Had a little extra time on his hands?  The only people who find this sort of thing disturbing are the fundamentalists Christians who actually believe it's real.  Oh, there is one very effective scare about two thirds of the way in, wonderfully set up.  But it's a ""make you jump"" moment.  There's nothing deeper than that.
The DVD has no bonus material other than a trailer, which is really just a teaser that doesn't show anything. The picture and sound quality are very good, though.",1042934400,,1853,4.700617283950617

The one thing I loved about Exorcist 3 was the fantastic screenplay and also the subtle horror. Where Exorcist 1 went for the jugular with its disturbing visual effects, Exorcist 3 is more of a psychological horror, more Hitchcock than Argento.
The cast are all excellent especially George C.Scott as Lieutenant Kindermann..It is a very similar character to the one he played in 'The Changeling' - another excellent horror film.
Brad Dourif plays the mental patient who claims to be the Gemini Killer. He is the right person for the role as he has a very weird and creepy way about him that is just right for the part.
When Scott interviews him in his dark cell, it really is a very creepy scene which is ably enhanced by the vibrant screenplay.
The film has a few shocking moments but they are infrequent enough. The climax of the film is very effective. Critics have said that it is a cop-out and too much like the original but it is a logical conclusion to the third film if taken out of context of the first one.
It is nice to sit back every once in a while and appreciate a film that is a horror but is not a slasher film or does not have much gore in it. This is such a film.
If you are comparing it to the original, you may be disappointed but as a work of art on its own merits it more than holds its own.",1042848000,,1511,4.178082191780822

""The Exorcist III"" needed an exorcism itself--to eliminate the meddling demons at Morgan Creek Productions.

When William Peter Blatty indicated that he wanted to make a film based on his novel ""Legion"" (a sequel of sorts to ""The Exorcist"" that Blatty had also written), Morgan Creek Productions which had bought the rights to his sequel novel ""Legion"" were pretty excited. Blatty was upfront that the film would not be a direct sequel to William Friedkin's film (and  Blatty's novel) but have some of the same characters and deal with the supernatural elements from both.

Much more of a supernatural detective story than a horror film, Blatty's dialog has a black humor undercurrent to it that gives the film its own unique tone substantially different than ""The Exorcist"".

With Lee J. Cobb deceased and Reverend William O'Malley SJ declining to return to his role of Father Joseph Dyer, Blatty cast the often brilliant George C. Scott to take on Cobb's role as Kinderman and Ed Flanders as Father Dyer both of whom owned their roles in this film. Blatty submitted his film (then entitled ""Legion"" NOT ""The Exorcist III) and Morgan Creek asked him to change the name to ""The Exorcist III"". They also screened it and, with the new title, test audiences naturally  were disappointed there wasn't an exorcism. The film tanked at the box office. It didn't matter that Morgan Creek had Blatty go back and do reshoots with an additional cast member from the first film and a restructuring of the entire last third of the film (also some scenes were cut from earlier in the film). Blatty noted that he begged Fox NOT to put a number in the title because he was afraid the stink of ""The Exorcist II"" would sink the film (indeed at one point it was also titled ""Exorcist 1990"").

The deleted scenes were destroyed by Morgan Creek (or misplaced depending on what you believe) and the only version that existed was Blatty's film which received decided mixed reviews. Time has been kind to the film and it has been reassessed and recognized as an ambitious film that ackles some of the themes raised in the original film and some new ones as well.

Kinderman finds himself chasing a serial killer nicknamed the Gemini Killer. The only problem is that Gemini was executed 15 years before. Kinderman's friendship with Father Dyer continues 15 years later and the two go see movies now and then (as per the ending of the ""The Exorcist""). Dyer becomes a key part of the story here as Kinderman pursues a killer that increasingly seems to have a link to the events of ""The Exorcist"".

Shout has attempted to reassemble Blatty's original vision with the best available elements (a VHS tape up-scaled that contains most of the surviving footage) and using elements from the released version to fill in the gap. As Blatty ( at spry 88) notes in the long audio interview (which acts as a loose commentary track). Blatty chose not to regurgitate the first film even as he tackled this one. Shout was upfront about the image quality varying. This isn't a perfect presentation but it's the best we will ever have. The ""Director's Cut"" is located on disc two with image quality varying depending on the source and the condition.  Nevertheless, there are some scenes that couldn't be recovered including an alternate opening sequence after the main titles that took place right after ""The Exorcist"" and the death of Father Karras.

The second disc also has a documentary on the production of the film including ""Death Be Not Proud"" (broken into chapters). The doc features interviews with composer Barry DeVorzan, producer Carter DeHaven, actor Brad Dourif and others discussing ""The Exorcist"" and the history of the production of ""The Exorcist III"".

The first disc features a new transfer of the theatrical released and it features a wonderful looking transfer for the film.  Audio is very immersive with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix. Dialog remains crystal clear.

The special features on disc one includes deleted scenes, alternate takes, bloopers and a vintage featurette. We also get the deleted prologue for the film. The special features are rounded out by vintage interviews.

As with most Shout releases, we get a newly commissioned cover and an alternate cover using the original poster as the cover.

Is Blatty's vision better? It isn't in my opinion but it is an interesting alternate version of the movie. The changes didn't improve the film (which is very good) and both versions remain very good films. It's nice that we get anything that resembles Blatty's original vision. I do think that the film would have played better if it had been called ""Legion"" though.

Recommended.

Original Review:
Let's be honest about The Exorcist 2--it followed the wrong character. There wasn't anything all that interesting about Linda Blair's character in the original. The meat and potatos of the film was Jason Miller as Father Karras and Max Von Sydow. In this spooky and powerful sequel based on Blatty's book Legion, George C. Scott takes on the role of Detective Bill Kinderman. The film follows Scott's pursuit of the Gemini Killer (played by the always spooky Brad Dourif). The Gemini Killer was executed but there's a copycat killer on the loose. Scott's character comes to believe that it's not a copycat killer but something beyond the natural and predenatural level.
Blatty's direction is sharp and taunt. He's obviously picked up a hint or two from William Friedekin (The Exorcist, French Connection)and Robert Wise (The Haunting, The Andromeda Strain). His use of silence creates added tension in a number of sequences. Blatty uses suspense vs. gore to create a charged atmosphere that allows the tension to build. His script is intelligent and fleshes out much of what was missing in the original film and novel of The Exorcist.
Scott gives a stunning, complex performance and Jason Miller's performance captures the mixture of terror and power his character feels given his circumstances. There really isn't a weak link in this fine, underrated and largely unseen film. By all rights the DVD edition should have a director's commentary. If Scott and Miller were around they'd also provide a fine commentary on their craft. Since that isn't possible, perhaps someone will ask Campbell Scott at some point to comment on his father's strong performance in this chiller.
The Exorcist 3 (along with another film Scott appeared in called The Changling)is a perfect example of what horror films should do;' they should not shock as much as build to a number of terrifying moments. THis is a DVD well worth having and proves that sometimes a sequel can be the equal to its original.",1036281600,,6707,4.920353982300885
1260828,2,B0000399W9,"I found Exorcist 3 to be better than Exorcist II but not as good as the original Exorcist. Exorcist 3 is somewhat of a continuation of the first film only without the character of Linda Blair and her mother. This movie is a bit of a snoozer in some areas but the end is pretty wicked. I would only recommend watching this if you want to know what happens after the Exorcist or Exorcist II. However, if you haven't seen Exocist II then do yourself a favor and skip on to part 3.",1032912000,,477,4.139784946236559
1260829,5,B0000399W9,"From the eerie opening dream sequence, I was drawn into this film by William Peter Blatty's great screenplay (based on his book, Legion) and confident directing. He deftly blends elements of mystery and horror together to create an atmosphere of evil that is both subtle at times and shocking at others. And just as William Friedkin did in the orginal Exorcist, the employment of auditory stimuli are used in a way that get under your skin and stay there.
The plot revolves around Detective Bill Kinderman--played this time by the great George C. Scott--trying to solve a series of gruesome murders that seem to somehow be related to the exorcism of Regan MacNeil 17 years ago. The story is allowed to develop at a relaxed pace, and will keep you guessing as to what's happening and why. But as it continues to unfold, Kinderman's faith in God, which he admits that he doesn't have much of, and his own sanity are tested by an ungodly force that he can't begin to comprehend. Blatty takes all the things we believe in and comfort us--faith in God, religious symbols, and Good over Evil--and tries to eradicate them right in front of our eyes and make us question our own comfortable reality.
Overall, there are many scenes that will bring you right out of your seat because they are so damn scary. The few parts with Kinderman interrogating the Gemini killer (Brad Dourif) are also very intense, and are a rare glimpse into the mind of a sick killer. One problem I had with the film is that the ending seemed a little too predictable and rushed, but in conclusion does not detract from the overall strength of the film that much. If you appreciate intelligent horror films (yes, there are some of them around), you should see this well-made film.",1023148800,,1746,4.672077922077922
1260830,4,B0000399W9,"George C. Scott's low-key, world-weary persona is an excellent foil for the evil force in this film - the huge distance between his character and that of the standard screaming half-naked teen babysitter provides for a particularly intense matchup between Good and Evil.
For me, the film's ""fear factor"" is also heightened by the cinematography (regardless of whether it copies Kubrick, as you can't go far wrong copying Kubrick) and, in an interesting way, by the lack of gore.
Though ""The Exorcist"" was a great ride on its own, and any sequels are clearly about the money, this entry is a pretty scary movie.",1018915200,,610,4.875
1260831,5,B0000399W9,"Exorcist III is indeed one of the more underappreciated films in recent memory (another is Blatty's other directorial effort, the 9th Configuration).  The mistake made here was one of marketing.  In the studio hysteria to cash in on franchises, the boneheads marketing this fine picture attempted to sell it as another Jason, Freddy, Halloween, Scream, et al.  What they failed to understand was that this was a THINKING PERSON'S horror film.  I have low expectations for the 4th Exorcist presently in production without involvment from Friedkin or Blatty.
If you don't believe in God, what happens when you are face to face with the devil?  This, simplistically, is the key theme in Exorcist III.  It is thought provoking, horrific, and very suspenseful.  There are no naked babysitters to be found, and none of the key characters are incredibly stupid.  George C. Scott gives an incredible performance as the street hardened homicide detective who has seen it all...until now.
Definitely worth a rent/purchase.  (I own the DVD and, unfortunately, there's no commentary by Blatty, although I'm on the lookout for a reissue.)
Perhaps today's generation of horror fan should consider this film.  In a day where digital effects substitute fine writing and character development, this film illustates the most frightening horrors come from within.",1017878400,,1344,5.267605633802817
1260832,5,B0000399W9,"I got a good laugh at all the people who thought this movie was boring, and especially those who disparaged the jail cell sequences as being ""too philosophical"" or too long.
I'll just say this: if you were drawn in and captivated by the Apocalypse Now scenes in which Willard meets Kurtz, you'll ""get it"".  Otherwise you won't.  This film is NOT a slasher, NOT a Star Wars and NOT even a movie really; it reads much more like an intense novel, which--if that's your cup of tea--you'll never regret seeing.",1017014400,,505,4.538461538461538
1260833,3,B0000399W9,"Exorcist 3 is the third of what is (at the moment) a trilogy and it is interesting to note that all three are very different films with different stances. The first is more out right disturbing horror which whilst would be unfair to suggest that it resorts to gross-out scenes, does include such scenes which raise the scare ante no end. The second instalment is more like the calm after the storm which has no scares in it, it isn't completely without merit but any film which includes the line ""You have scientifically proven that a demon is inside her"" can't be taken too seriously. The third is more of a psychological afterthought. There is some very good dialogue and whilst George C Scott is not Lee J Cobb, the character of Kindermann is faithfully transferred and you can believe it is a later version of him. People going to see this expecting it too be another out-right scare fest will be dissapointed because whilst it is not without its unsettling moments, they are different to the first and not as powerful. The first film has grotesque and believable changes to an innocent young girl, here there are just some fairly well crafted jumps. But little more.
Enriching and seeing more of Georgetown works well and the credit sequence is disturbing and sets the scene well. I really would not like to live there.
The ending is dissapointing and I can only ponder to the version that Blatty had originally wanted. Maybe in 13 years time we will have the intended version of E3 released.
Bottom line, is there is still enough in here to make you ponder about your place in the universe and how safe it is and this film also conveys well issues such as loss, friendship and melancholy mainly through George C Scott. Ultimately though it is a little anameic in comparison to the original. Maybe nothing will come close again.",1014854400,,1833,4.643076923076923

1260840,4,B0000399W9,"As someone who reviewed the dvd for this film said, this is probably the best horror film of the 90's. Gothic, startling, and genuinly creepy with one of the all time greatest movie scares. Besides many of the same actors this movie bears many resemblences to another Blatty movie TWINKLE TWINKLE KILLER KANE (also known as The 9th Configuration). The tone of both movies is similar but I digress. It's a tour de force for all the actors involved. George C Scott gives a fantasticly human performance as Kinderman, taking over for the late Lee J. Cobb. Of particular note is the sequence when Kinderman has lost someone very close to him. His breakdown during the investigation is one of the best pieces of work in his career.  This film also has an amazing dream sequence featuring George Scott walking through the way station to heaven. Another favorite goose bump inducing sequence is the confession by the old woman in a church confession booth. Most people I talk to about this movie about laugh when I tell them how great it is. The answer when I ask if they've ever seen it is always ""no"". One of my favorite pastimes has become converting people to appreciate this picture...it works every time :) It's a shame that it didn't get the following it deserved when it was released but I'll bet 20 bucks right now that in another 10 or 15 years this movie will be looked back on quite favorably. It's only drawback is it's ending which is why I give the movie 4 stars and not 5. In fact it's so out of tone with the rest of the movie i have to assume that Blatty had nothing to do with it. Of other particular note is a monologue Scott has regarding a fish in his bathtub. Classic Blatty. The movie deals with questions of faith and god in ways that are human and true. Exorcist 3 is NOT like the first movie, in tone, gore, or scares. This movie, while taking place in the Exorcist universe, creates it's own reality and vision. Watch it with an open mind and the lights off. What I would really like to see is a full blown DVD treatment with a Director's cut, Blatty's commentary, a behind the scenes and any thing else they can put in.

Exorcist 3 is more like a serial killer movie and it is a very good one. Too bad this movie was a flop during its theatrical run so it never achieved the same popularity as the first Exorcist. But it is a very creepy and scary movie and suprisingly there is no gore portrayed in the movie. Check out chapter 22, I think that has the greatest jump in horror movie. The scene I am talking about only last a couple seconds but I guarantee that if you think of Exorcist 3 you will remember that particular scene. The late George C Scott gave superb performance as Detective Bill Kenderman who is puzzled as a serial killer that was executed in the electric chair 15 years ago appear to strike again. Look for cameo by Patrick Ewing and Fabio in a dream sequence. I would have given this 5 stars if only Warner has released this DVD with some extra features. This DVD has none except one theatrical trailer which I think shouldn't be considered as an extra feature. Warner has released the first Exorcist 3 times on DVD.

Also, do not talk to others if they are watching with you.  This is a great murder mystery with a big supernatural twist.  A superb performance by two of my favorite actors, George C.

If you don't pay attention, it will seem like there is more dead time than there actually is.

The movie would darken at random moments, and depending on the chemically-induced skew of the viewer, could be seen as timed with specific frightening events in the film.  At that time, it was scary as all hell.  Having seen it a few more times, without the dramatic ""light changes"" it wasn't nearly as scary.  I also realized the reason I appreciated all of the visual trickery was because Blatty was photocopying Stanley Kubrick, especially the unconventional distance shots and imaginative use of ""deafening"" silences between characters.
Although Brad Dourif and George C. Scott give convincing performances, the script is borderline and the dialogue constantly veers from genuine to absurd.  The visual style remains consistent and is the best thing this movie has going for it.  The whole thing is shot in a grainy, grimy print, with lots of good gothic imagery, which adds to the darkened mood.  There are some classic shots in this movie : The distance shot of the hospital desk (which is straight from the Shining), the old lady scampering across the ceiling, the visit from the ""nurse"", and the first conversation between the Gemini killer and George C. Scott.  I also like the fact that all the characters still smoke heavily, especially the doctors and nurses.  Apparently lit tobacco is symbolic of character-related cynicism.
Blatty doesn't seem to want to ""gore"" you to death, but is rather concerned with building mood over the length of the film, which is great.  The problem is that the plot seems more like an afterthought, which dilutes the effectiveness of its resolution somewhat.

The  movie is a true sequel to the first film and you don't have to have seen  the first one to enjoy this. Why George C Scott was nominated for a  ""Razzie"" for this film, I can't figure it out. He was terrific.  The film features one of the most suspenseful ""jump scenes"" in  movie history: THE HALLWAY SCENE. There are a few flaws with the film. The  woman playing Scott's wife seemed to have her voice dubbed over and her  reactions in a scary moment are terrible. But, it won't distract you from  enjoying the movie. This movie came out a few years before X-Files, but it  plays like an episode from that series. I give this film an A-.",948499200,,928,4.536144578313253
1260854,3,B0000399W9,"The Exorcist 3 (Legion) is a good horror film, although it's very slow in places. The scariest bit for me was the headless statue of Jesus jumping out at a girl. That was freaky.
I recommend it to fans of the original.  George C Scott does a good performance as Lt. Kinderman",947721600,,275,4.288461538461538
1260855,4,B0000399W9,"William Peter Blatty adapted the script for this second sequel of the Exorcist series, as he did the first. The story is very good, continuing the life of Lieutenant Kinderman and Father Dyer, after they witnessed the  death of one of the exorcists in the first film. From the beginning, when  the statue of Christ opens its eyes, the film is a chilling experience. It  is more frightening in an atmospheric way than the first. It gives the  presence of evil spirituality, a tangibility, a feeling that it has a  density and dimension and is surrounding you. This exhertion can almost  grant an interaction of the audience, that compells them to feel that some  invisible presence has inherited the room they watch it in. The first  Exorcist compelled and frightened by using straight-forward explicit  imagery. Only an avid reader of Blatty's novels could fully understand the  symbolism and subtlety of the dialogue. Scott was not the original  Kinderman, nevertheless portrays the roll finely. As does Brad Dourif as  the venemous Gemini Killer and Jason Miller as ""Patient X."" The  film's specifically major flaw is the use of celebrity appearances such as  Fabio, in a dream sequence of Kinderman. When there are first suggestions  of this, one is prepared for it to be frightening to some extent, due to  the boundryless potential of terror that can be incorporated in dream  sequences. Yet, it is ultimatley a tryingly humorous scenario, and all  fails within. The films ending is basically a re-enactment of the exorcism  in the first film, and fails to produce a plot-twist, which is decidedly  necessary to conclude the saga of evil patented by the Exorsist. On a  technical gripe, the sound is relentlessly awkward, even in silent scenes  without any background music. Ironically the sound editors of the first  film won an Oscar for their work, it's safe to assume they had nothing to  do with the soundtrack of this film. Overall, The Exorcist III is a very  good sequel to the most horrifying film ever made. Those who find it  anything less than that are comparing it too much to the predecessor.",946425600,,2111,4.892655367231638
1260856,4,B0000399W9,"The first time I saw this was on TV.  Needless to say, it was edited for content.  Even with it being censored, I was drawn into the story.  The best scenes are the interviews between Scott and Dourif.  Dourif's  performance as the Gemini Killer brings out the same uncomfortable laughter  that Jack Nicholson causes in Batman.  A great job of writing and directing  by William Peter Blatty.  I hope the book comes back into press, so I can  read it.",944179200,,450,4.5125
1260857,5,B0000399W9,"Nine years after its release, ""Exorcist 3"" remains one of the most unfairly maligned films ever made.  After the disastrous ""Exorcist 2: The Heretic"" (which involved neither  ""Exorcist"" director William Friedkin nor writer William Peter  Blatty), Blatty created a true sequel to the original masterpiece.  Brilliant, thoughtful, and character-driven, ""Exorcist 3"" will  disappoint only those who do not have the patience to listen to  beautifully-crafted dialogue and allow the film to steadily weave its web.  Why did the film perform poorly at the box office?  In our modern canon of  horror films, we've grown accustomed to horror sequels avoiding all  rational reason for existing (character development, unanswered questions,  etc.) and instead being conceived from the beginning as tired re-treads  designed only to make money.  There's even a camp value here, and many  horror sequels are considered sussesses for this: more of the same; strong  opening weekend; end of story.  ""Exorcist 3"" avoids these traps,  and was ultimately punished for it.  First of all, the film's original  title -- ""Legion"" -- is the proper introduction to the film's  themes.  Unfortunately, the choice was made that since the more intriguing  and appropriate ""Legion"" didn't have immediate title-recognition  and probably wouldn't effectively draw audiences, the more recognizable  ""Exorcist 3"" was chosen...against Blatty's wishes, and in spite  of the fact that ""Exorcist 3"" wisely ignores the very existence  of ""The Heretic"" and begins where the original ended.  (One does  have to wonder why the producers didn't compromise with a title like  ""The Exorcist: Legion."") Structurally, ""Exorcist 3""  also attacks our senses in a much subtler (but equally unnerving) way than  seen in the furious conclusion to ""The Exorcist.""  Don't get me  wrong -- ""The Exorcist"" is one of my favorite films, and embodies  flawless film-making from beginning to end.  The fact that ""Exorcist  3"" is much quieter and more character-driven, however, meant that many  members of the original's core audience didn't know what to make of it; in  addition, the plot of ""Exorcist 3"" requires a working knowledge  of the events surrounding the original, meaning that younger viewers who  hadn't even seen the original were doomed to be lost in the film's complex  plot.  Again, all of this is a shame.  ""Exorcist 3"" is not only  one of the smartest horror films ever made, its considerations of the  nature of faith (and the imagery which surrounds these questions) make it  one of the most thoughtful.  Blatty has always dealt with issues of faith  in his writing, and the meditations on the subject in ""Exorcist  3"" are among the most profound I've seen in film.  Consider the  question asked of Lt. Kinderman (George C. Scott) in the film's conclusion:  ""Have I helped your unbelief?""  In the power of the moment, we  expect a certain response from Kinderman.  We hear a quite different one,  however, and we're momentarily puzzled -- until we consider the deeper  issues of faith behind the monologue and the spiritual journey Kinderman  has been on.  The response then makes perfect sense, and the film would  work no other way.  This is great writing, given even more power by Scott's  performance. Because this is a thriller, the film's thrills need to be  addressed.  As I said, the film is much more quietly intense than the  original -- but I challenge you not to leap from your chair during the  payoff of the hospital hallway scene (one shot with no edits...just slowly,  steadily building tension).  The craftsmanship of this scene is a wonder to  behold, and has deservedly received comparisons to the scene-structure of  Hitchcock. Regardless of all that I've said, I can acknowledge that the film  won't be for everyone.  Things don't jump out at the audience every five  minutes (with the requisite music stinger to make absolutely sure we jump),  and I understand that many look for that and that alone.  But  ""Exorcist 3"" is so much more, and represents the work of people  who cared about where their story was headed...and why.  It is a genuine  classic.",944092800,,4140,5.099099099099099
1260858,5,B0000399W9,"To transfer those words from a classic ""good feeling"" movie to ones that stay imbedded in your mind as pure horror through a small peice of the movie can only be described as amazing. This movie digs deep into  your worst nightmares and portrays them into what appears to be at first  glance a murder mystery. If it wasn't for the title which preludes the  viewers high ""expectations"" of the first movie,I would think it  to as frightning as it was 16 years ago. Considering the genre overload of  frightning films as well as higher technological techniques, which I might  add has ""numbed"" me to most so called scarey films,I have to say  that this movie touches that ""hide my eyes and tell me when its  over"" spot thats been sitting dormant for longer than I care to  remember..All with basic ""old fashion"" movie tecniques brought up  to modern levels with absolutley no computer graphics! It all comes together  as a refreshing,truly frightning film dripping with all the key elements  that make for a great horror movie...Heart pounding suspence,excellent cast  and storyline and oh yes...Satan!

1260859,5,B0000399W9,"Everything that makes a movie great.. ingenious script, convincing acting, and beautiful photography are all illustrated perfectly in William Peter Blatty's Exorcist III.
It could only be described as the  ""Godfather"" of horror, with elements of wit, humor, and drama  seamlessly integrated to create the severely underrated film.
The use of  humor and symbolism is often subtle, but very effective and the script  exhibits some of the best dialogue ever portrayed. All the actors were  frighteningly perfect, from the jerky body movements of the neurotic  doctor, to the casually evil persona of the Gemini killer (who's role was  replicated in an X file episode).
One warning though, it is imperative  that you see the original and pay special attention to the character of  Daemon, as his courage and sacrifices are the basis for Exorcist III
If  this movie ever is released on DVD, that will provide the motivation I need  to purchase a player.",935625600,,948,5.090909090909091
