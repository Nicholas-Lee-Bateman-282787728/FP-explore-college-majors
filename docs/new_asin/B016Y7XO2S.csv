7481152,3,B016Y7XO2S,"It's a decent movie for the genre. I bought this for my husband, he liked it more than I did. I found the plot pretty predictable, but i also was not expecting Pride and Prejudice either.

My husband is ex-Special Forces from Vietnam so he kept pointing out the inconsistencies in military procedure, uniforms etc. That was entertaining in it's own way.",1518480000,,353,4.693548387096774

A DVD is A DVD.  I like the content and I added it to my extensive collection in hopes of the day that I can shut down DirectTV, as for the DVD itself being good or bad, that I won't know until I watch it and that will be beyond any warranty date, so my review doesn't really matter.",1532044800,,287,3.783333333333333
