3957339,2,B002N5N5UM,"Not sure Hollywood knows how to be funny anymore. It seems about 1 in 20 comedys actually provide more than 3 good laughs. Toilet humor is fine, but an hour and 23 minutes of it?

I picked up this movie because the previews were funny. In the typical Hollywood fashion, those trailer scenes ended up being the only funny ones.

Save your rental fee.",1259107200,2,349,4.4375
3957340,3,B002N5N5UM,"Selleck Motors is going through a dry spell.  The manager's solution?  Bring in an auto mercenary: Don ""The Goods"" Ready, who decides that if he can't sell every last car off the lot over the 4th of July weekend, he'll retire.  Is he up for the challenge?

Of course he is; and, in the hands of Jeremy Piven, Ready is an unlikable slop, a hit-em-hard-and-leave-em-crying kinda guy.  Piven isn't necessarily perfect for the role (this film is way below him) but he's at least enjoyable; the same for James Brolin, who is slumming it hardcore but is at least having a ball (in more ways than one...).  Ving Rhames is a pleasant surprise, adding a unique little twist into this by-the-numbers farce.  Really, there's nothing here we haven't seen before: raunchy jokes that are hit and miss; the same for racist and sexist and every other kind of joke (the hate crime segment is particularly hilarious); a rocking soundtrack (with karaoke); a wounded hero who has the opportunity to find out a little something about himself; a laugh-out-loud Will Ferrell cameo (two of them, actually); and your 21st century farce supporting characters: David Koechner (hilarious as always); Rob Riggle (as a ten-year-old); Ken Jeong (not as funny as in ""Role Models,"" but still pretty good); Kathryn Hahn (a stand-out); Alan Thicke (grossly under-used); Craig Robinson, Kristin Schaal, and a whole host of other faces you'll recognize.

As you may have guessed, ""The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard"" isn't anything new; this is both good and bad.  It never really tries to break new ground or stand out from the crowd.  This really isn't a mortal sin (there's something to be a said for a movie that knows its own limitations); but then again, with A-list talent like Jeremy Piven, James Brolin, and Ving Rhames behind it, we're kind of expecting something new.  You'll get a few great laughs out of ""The Goods;"" the Will Ferrell sky-diving scene in particular is truly memorable, and there's some fantastic irony in Ving Rhames saying, ""My safe word is 'blueberry pancakes'"" (for you ""Pulp Fiction"" fans out there).  Ultimately, ""The Goods"" is a movie you should at least see once, then make up your mind if you want to make it a permanent part of your collection.  I wasn't blown away...but I wouldn't be adverse to watching it again.",1258934400,4,2313,4.8253164556962025
3957341,4,B002N5N5UM,"Part of the latest stream of unabashedly vulgar slob comedies to come along, The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard is proud of its rampant crudeness and political incorrectness, and it's all the more funny because of it.  Jeremy Piven channels his Ari Gold persona as mercenary car salesman for hire extraordinaire Don ""The Goods"" Ready, who is hired by a desperate dealership owner (James Brolin) to save his business.  It isn't long before Don and his team (including Ving Rhames, David Koechner, and Kathryn Hahn) get things moving, and Don falls for the owner's daughter (My Boys' Jordana Spiro) who's engaged to a 30-some year old boy-band wanna-be (The Hangover's Ed Helms, in fine form).  The developments and story of The Goods is predictable to its core, but what makes it work is Piven's hilarious performance, as well as seeing old pros like Brolin, Rhames, Alan Thicke, and Charles Napier have dirty, gleeful fun the whole ride through.  All in all, if R-rated slob comedies are your thing, The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard delivers, well, the goods.",1258761600,9,1055,4.910112359550562

3957461,2,B002N5N5UM,"Not my kind of humor.  Unbelievable business contractors who supposedly travel to help car retailers sell their cars in mass when the car sales company is in financial trouble.  These contractors flew in for a three day sales of vehicles and in the process tried to inspire the team to sell as many cars as possible to prevent the owner from defaulting on his debt.  The team is made up of a bunch of personalities that somehow creates silly humor that isn't funny to a more educated crowd.  Most of the jokes are racist or sexist, etc. even though the cast is very multicultural.  If this is acceptable behavior or conversation among Americans, then we are in trouble as a nation.  There are a few warmer and kinder moments, but they don't make up for the terrible humor.  Most likely, you will either hate this form of comedy or you will love it.  I hate it.  Decent actors/comedians wasted on a terrible plot and script.",1521590400,,923,4.545454545454546

That would have been the winner right there.

A thin plot routinely sets the mood for great payoffs, but then proceeds to miss ever-so-slightly with the punchline, like it knows how to be funny but is afraid to fully commit. It boasts a tremendous cast of supporting actors, drawn from no less than a dozen genuine classics, but Jeremy Piven fails once again to graduate into a reliable lead and that front-office vacancy leaves the picture feeling hollow.

They get the call to save a dealership. The movie has some laugh out loud lines like DJ Request saying, ""Nobody tells DJ Request what to play."" Or ""Did you ever have a relationship last longer than a lap dance?"" Besides the smelly scene with Will Ferrell, Ed Helms was fairly bad. I loved Ed on the Daily Show, but face it, he can't act. Rob Riggle did a good job as a 10 year old. The movie moves along smartly through the first day of sales after which the plot suddenly changes direction. Piven seriously examines his life, the car dealership is being sold, etc etc. At this point the movie goes down hill. This was supposed to be a senseless comedy about selling cars, not a bad lesson on establishing roots.

Rated: R
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 14 August 2009

I have been a huge fan of Jeremy Piven ever since the first time I saw him on an episode of Ellen. The man is hilarious and he's very talented. I was shocked when he did not receive an Oscar nomination for his outstanding performance in 2006's Somkin' Aces.

At least he's back in another starring role as Don Ready, in the very hysterical The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard. I recently had someone tell me that Piven's portrayal of Don Ready, reminded them of ""his character Ari Gold from Entourage; only sleazier and with less money!"" Entourage being my absolute favorite show, I couldn't agree more.

His character in this film, Don Ready, is the ultimate used car salesman. His business card, says it all: ""Don Ready: I move cars, Mother F***er!"" You could say he lives, only to sell cars. It's his darkest passion and the only thing he has going for him. He lives his life on the road; traveling from dying dealership to dying dealership, with his mission being to restore order and keep the place on its feet. As depressing as this life may sound, he is more than content with it. Or is he?

When Ben Selleck's (James Brolin) beloved dealership meets the head of its demise, he gives Don Ready a call. Don and his crew come a running.

His teammates are Babs (Kathryn Hahn), who uses sexual advances towards desperate men to move her share of the cars; Jibby (Ving Rhames) who looks tough, but admits he has never made love to woman; and Brent (David Koechner) who tells us while he's eating at a strip club, that he doesn't think he can eat breakfast at any place but a strip club.

They have to sell more than 200 cars over Fourth of July weekend. It should be no problem for this team of ruthless salesmen. But what Don didn't plan on, was falling for his new boss' daughter Ivy (Jordana Spiro). Is he an untamable stallion, destined for life alone on the road, or will she win his heart and cause him to fail at his goal of clearing her father's lot?

As if that's not enough pressure for Don, if he does in fact fall short of moving these cars, Selleck's lot will be handed over to Ivy's scumbag,, soon to be father-in-law, Stu (Alan Thicke). Ivy's fianc Paxton (Ed Helms) is a complete tool, who dreams of becoming famous in his three-man `boy-band' comprised of men all over the age of 30. For a guy like Don Ready, the challenge is stiff, as he will naturally want to have the girl and sell the goods.

The movie is jam-packed full of some of the funniest comedians out there right now. One of whom is a rock-star in the world of comedy and is un-credited in the film and will remain so in this review. Trust me, you will appreciate the surprise.

The film is dirty but witty and we like it that way. To shed light on a few of these moments; Ben Selleck obviously has some closeted homo-sexual tendencies, because he is constantly flirting with and sexually harassing Brent. Selleck also has a 10-year-old son who due to an abnormal birth-defect, looks like he's 30. Babs is completely infatuated with the 10-year-old nonetheless, and is relentlessly trying to come up with ways to seduce him, without his knowing he's being seduced. It sounds like it could be bad, but trust me it's all executed very well and it's hilarious.

No punches are pulled folks. If you think they've gone too far with one inappropriate joke or gag, then you may want to duck because another one is sure to follow. There is racial humor, sexual humor (sometimes even involving parachutes and sex toys) and there are plenty of stabs at car salesman schemes and scams that will have you rolling.

There are a ton of enjoyable comedies with fast-talking, foul mouthed, self involved guys, who think they are big shots, and this is one of them. But when was the last good one?",1264896000,2,4167,4.5595716198125835
3958022,3,B002N5N5UM,"This movie is not the greatest, but it is funny.  It goes along the lines of the old 1980 movie Used Cars.  It has its moments.  There is raciest seen in there and some stupid stuff like eating a regular meal in a strip club.  Or them being able to violate the FAA rules and turning the airplane into a party plane.  I was all for comedy, but it was a little much.  The Boy Band stuff was pure 80's and if this movie had came out closer to that time period I think it would have done better.  Most people of that time period wouldn't have come to this movie so I think some of the innuendos were lost.",1264809600,,601,3.9583333333333335

Mr. Piven should be ashamed to have name on this boil of a film.

If I got this movie free, I'd still want my money back.

The original film with Kurt Russell was a better movie (and that's just sad).

Watch anything else, even old home movies have to be more entertaining.

The plot is basically a depressed car salesman is hired to turn around a failing car lot.  He takes his crew with him.  They do the job.  It's not interesting, funny, or amusing.  It's not even sad.  It's just boring and stupid.

I'd rather go to my gynecologist than ever see this film again.",1263513600,5,829,4.197452229299363
3958025,4,B002N5N5UM,"This movie has alot going for it.  The cast is full with some big names, Jeremy Piven, James Brolin, Ving Rhames, Ed Helms, and several others you will recognize from numerous funny movies.  The cast does a great job of keeping you focused on the quick whit of the lead character, Don Ready played by Jeremy Piven, as a slick used car salesman with a team of qwerky but funny associates that travel around to promote car lots in need of desperate measures to move some inventory.  The cast definitely does its job in creating numerous hysterical moments that will keep you laughing.  The only downside to this movie is that the storyline lacks at times and leaves you a little lost.  That being said this movie's intended audience would not be watching this movie to be engrossed in a deep storyline but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Overall if you like movies like Old School, Road Trip, The Hangover, etc. then I think this movie is in your ballpark.  If you are looking for just a good basic laugh, then I recommend you watch this movie.",1262995200,4,1046,4.531914893617022

Despite what appears to be a good cast ( although my low opinion of Piven descended even further), this is a classic example of a movie with the thinnest of 'plots"", bad writing, and actors going through the motions. Just bloody awful. As an earlier reviewer stated, this steaming pile doesn't compare with the very good 'Used Cars"", with Kurt Russell, etc.
Don't waste your time, or money, on this wretched excuse for a movie, the cinematic equivalent of a used Yugo.",1262044800,6,502,4.651685393258427
3958038,1,B002N5N5UM,"Not funny, not interesting, and not worth your time.  This movie can only be described as being some awful attempt at taking the the humor from Anchorman (idiotic and over-the-top, but still funny) and trying to make it work with used car salesmen.  The storyline is pathetic, and you notice this right off the bat.  Within 10 minutes Piven gives some pointless speech on an airplane that ends is cheers from the passengers and him motorboating the stewardess - believe, my summary of that scene is ten times funnier than actually watching it.  Plus, as usual, Piven simply tries to play ""Ari"" as this is his only talent.  Oh, and his female sidekick is nicknamed ""Babs"", just like his business partner in Entourage.  Don't waste your time renting this, let alone buying it.  I only gave it a shot using a free rental code from Red Box, and I'm still upset that I wasted an hour of my life before turning it off without seeing the finish.",1261440000,5,938,4.580838323353293
3958039,2,B002N5N5UM,"From the cast this movie looks like it will be good. Watching the trailers would further enforce this illusion. Unfortunately, this is not the case. As much as I like Ed Helms, Ken Jeong, David Koechner etc. this movie produces more groans than laughs. When the antagonist (Ed Helms) is more appealing than the protagonist (Jeremy Piven), then clearly the writing has to be pointed at as to why this movie fails to achieve it's intended affect (which is meager at that, to make you laugh). Also, the fact that there are no extras on the DVD should clue you in to how everyone involved with this stinker would rather forget this movie than remember it.

There are some laughs in the movie, Ed Helms is a bright spot, Will Ferrell's cameo is memorable, and there are some hilarious politically incorrect lines that Charles Napier's character (Dick Lewiston) delivers but the main flaw in this movie stems from the fact that I didn't want to root for Don Ready (Jeremy Piven) and his team of mercenary  auto sellers. I found them repulsive and with NO redeemable qualities. That would be fine if this was an edgy drama. But this film aims to be a fun comedy.

The handful of good performaces by the aforementioned solid cast save this from being a total waste of time but, not so much that you don't realize you've been sold a lemon by a sleazy used car salesman at the end of the movie.",1260921600,6,1384,4.528

3958041,4,B002N5N5UM,"The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard bombed hard at the box office this August for reasons I have yet to figure out.  My wife and I expected nothing from this movie, and with the bar set so low we were astonished at just how gut-bustingly funny it was from start to finish.  Jeremy Piven--so annoying is just about everything he has ever been in--finds a perfect groove in Don Ready, a used-car hustler who needs to impose his will on reluctant consumers the way the rest of need to breathe.  He takes an almost prurient pleasure in these conquests which, by itself, would have been funny enough.  The fact that he is joined by a team of similarly unscrupulous cohorts lets the movie maintain a comedic momentum which never lets up--start to finish.  Ready and his gang (Kathryn Hahn and Ving Rhames, among others) are flown to James Brolin's car lot to spur enough sales for Brolin to keep his business from being taken over by...wait for it...Alan Thicke and Ed Helms.  I have always maintained that Christopher McDonald, so slimy in Thelma and Louise, Happy Gilmore, and The Iron Giant, is one of the consistently best bad guys in the business, but Alan Thicke and Ed Helms give him a run for his money. They steal every scene they are in, and any remnant of the good heart that Thicke built up as the vanilla father on Growing Pains is obliterated within seconds of his appearance on screen.  Their characters make a perfect foil for Don Ready, since they all share the lack of a moral compass and the open acknowledgement that there is no such thing as right and wrong--only winning and losing.

No stone goes unturned in pursuit of a laugh.  The movie opens with a scene of Don Ready convincing an entire flight that the future of our republic hinges on his right to smoke on the plane, during which he seduces a naive flight attendant not because he wants to but just because he can.  Other highlights include the beating of a Korean-American by salesmen whipped up into a gingoistic frenzy by Don Ready's recounting of Pearl Harbor, an openly racist/homophobic/misogynist elder salesman who despite every opportunity never learns the error of his ways, the uncomfortably sexual pursuit of a man-child by an under-sexed female sales rep, and an uncredited cameo by Will Ferrel whose character dies in the most ludicrous and hysterical fashion imaginable and whose meaningless death Don Ready, as expected, carries as a token burden (however paper-thin and utterly absurd).  And in a throwaway role as a DJ who believes that audience song requests are little more than a subterfuge for slavery, the Office's Craig Ferguson expresses a quiet pain and rage without any trace of humor-killing irony.  He's like a black Leslie Nielson.

So, do Don Ready and his team sell all of the cars and save the lot?  What do you think?  The plot exists only as a vehicle for the jokes, and to the film's credit almost all of the jokes are character driven--this isn't a story that relies on slapstick as a crutch.  As such, it is one of the funniest movies released this year, and it definitely deserves to be seen.  So ignore the naysayers on RottenTomatoes and enjoy yourself.  You won't regret it.",1260057600,22,3187,4.691202872531418
3958042,5,B002N5N5UM,Reading all these other reviews not really sure what people were expecting.  I thought this movie was very funny throughout.  When I go into a movie like this I don't expect the best acting but something that will make me laugh and that's exactly what happened.,1259971200,5,261,4.6521739130434785
3958043,3,B002N5N5UM,"I do not believe this to be as bad as listed here, and my customers have given the type of feedback expected for a raunchy Piven flick (sporadic rated R humor mixed with slow spots - but overall a film you do not hate or regret watching).

The story follows a traveling veteran crew (all excellently played: Ving Rhames, David Koechner, Kathryn Hahn, and the outstanding Jeremy Piven) of salespeople who help save flailing car lots. The raunch factor and one-liners are in full swing, but delivered in just a way that the sight gags and slander are funny throughout. The second and third acts drag a little as can happen in these kinds of films, but the ride of laughter and witty interaction outweigh the semi-sappy subplots. I have always liked Jordana Spiro and maybe this will help raise awareness on her previous work with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Boys-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000ZS8GXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Boys: The Complete First Season</a>.

The DVD has nothing for special features. The picture quality is intermittent but holds out during those important strip club scenes, and the sound is adequate. Hope you get a few laughs out of this. Rated R 100% - even in the first two minutes...nice work.",1259625600,7,1276,5.375

3958046,1,B002N5N5UM,"Had the day after thanksgiving off and figured it's a perfect hang out and watch a movie day. I heard this just came out recently and it looked funny. Boy was I wrong. I was watching this with a friend and after 10 mins I said to him, ""wow, this movie is pretty terrible so far huh?"" He agreed. It unfortunately did not get any better.

If you explain the general plot, then hear about the actors in it, you assume this movie would be average at WORST. Jeremy Piven playing a used car salesman - this script should write itself. The problem is they try to hit you over the head with every single joke, and in all honesty, most of them aren't funny. There's a few that make you chuckle, but most are just thrown in out of nowhere. All of the sudden someone is yelling and swearing for no reason, and it just didn't make me laugh at all. This is coming from someone who likes stupid comedies. Anchorman is completely stupid, but it's hysterical and well written. This movie is so poorly executed, it's absolutely painful to watch. It makes ""Step-Brothers"" look like a golden globe winner. I wish I would have spent the hour and half cleaning my room.

I recommend saving your money and waiting for ""The Hangover"" to come out in a few weeks.",1259280000,6,1238,4.354978354978355
3958047,1,B002N5N5UM,"What an amazingly bad movie!

We watched it last night in disbelief at how unfunny, forced, immature and pointless it was. It contains all the bad points of Judd Apatow/Will Ferrell movies and none of the good; Ferrell produced it, so he clearly has no touch for these things without Apatow's oversight. The script is beyond terrible. Toilet humor, racism, pathetic sex ""jokes"" and generally mindless grade-school-level gags make for an excruciating viewing experience.

Piven does his best; he's a good sleazeball but there's zero subtlety in the script or the direction so his game effort still falls flat. Each side character is poorly drawn at best. Ving Rhames is miscast and not even remotely funny, as with most of his fellow cast members. Arrested Development's Tony Hale is a rare glimmer of quality here, but hardly enough to save it. It's one of those flicks where you have to look away from the screen in embarrassment for the actors, and for yourself for watching.

It kept getting worse and worse until we looked at each other and said, ""Enough of our lives have been wasted by this movie."" We do that very rarely...maybe not enough, come to think of it...

The end of The Craps might explode in a dazzling shower of artistic redemption, but I will never know, as you couldn't make me watch this again with Malcolm McDowell's propped-open eyeballs.

Which just goes to show, once again, that choosing a movie because it's on Crockduster's Top Ten Rentals is sheer idiocy.
