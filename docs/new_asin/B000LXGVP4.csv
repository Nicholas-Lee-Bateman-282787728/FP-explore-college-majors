8164867,5,B000LXGVP4,"From the 1970s, this is one of the best crime thrillers made in Bollywood. I grew up in Mumbai surrounded by Bollywood movies, and hence my opinion is likely biased. But for me, put the best 10 James Bond movies on one side, and Johny Mera Naam on the other, and I'll pick the latter any time.

It stars some of the finest actors of the 60s and 70s - Premnath, Jeevan, Pran., I.S. Johar, Iftekhar.... the leading man Dev Anand already in his forties or more looking and acting superbly, and a perfect counterpoint to the young lovely Hema Malini. It was directed by Dev's brother, Vijay Anand - one of the most talented directors of the time. This movie is him at his directorial best. His other top efforts include Guide and Teeesri Manzil.

The final half-hour with its twists and turns, deception and trickery as the many characters attempt to outwit each other matches in intensity and brilliance the 20-25 minutes at the end of the second act of Le Nozze di Figaro. However director Anand was more astute in placing this sequence at the end of the movie unlike Mozart who has his in the middle of the opera, so that the next two acts lasting an hour and a half simply cannot match the second act, leading some credence to the Austrian emperor's reported comment about 'too many notes'.

It has songs of course .... by Kalyanji Anandji - who put in an top-notch background score and good songs including an outstanding bhajan (hymn) - He Re Om..... (sacred) and by contrast a strip-tease number (Husn ke laakhon rang) which was racy and innovative for the time (1970s) (profane).

One of its catchy numbers was used in a Simpsons episode - Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore a few years ago, with great comedic effect.

The only reservation is that the sound has not been remastered and is therefore rough on this dvd..........

One hopes it will be remastered and issued in Blu-ray format. A classic.",1340582400,,1895,4.575221238938053
