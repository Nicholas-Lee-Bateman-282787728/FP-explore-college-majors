8318725,3,B001LMUKWO,"This is a very simple introduction to the ideas of the crystal skulls. Much of the [speculative] historical information and alleged potential for the skulls presented by Childress can be found in the book he coauthored with Mehler. Dr. Hurtak's information is a little on the refreshing side, and cites the skulls' presence in art and religious iconography from the Orient, yet viewers are unfortunately never shown examples of these references. Bill Homann rounds out the speakers by discussing his experiences as caretaker of the Mitchell-Hedges skull. Again, the story of it's discovery as purported by Anna Mitchell-Hedges is further promulgated despite a lack of evidence suggesting its truth.

For a beginner in the realm of crystal skulls this might not be a bad investment. Anyone who has done a fair amount of reading on the topic will probably find little new information presented in this product. The production value on this DVD is rather low, although I am forgoing judging it on that basis. The DVD ends with a meditation with the Mitchell-Hedges skull in which viewers may participate.",1256169600,9,1101,5.116666666666666
