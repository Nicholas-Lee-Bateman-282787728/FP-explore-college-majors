8369523,5,B002FQG52O,"13 going on 30 is one of my favorite movies. It is a great romantic comedy that is more about self realization and growth then it is about romance. The idea that this 13 year old girl gets to see her future and what will happen to her if she becomes popular and shallow. She gets the chance to change her life to the better and become a person who cares more about herself, her morals, and happiness then popularity.

I think the casting was great, I really believe she is 13 instead. I also love him as the lead, I know later one people will see him as the Hulk, but I will always see him as Matt.

The fashion in the show is great too, and so is the 80's music. Also, I love New York and the show is set there. I'd suggest it. It is a feel good movie that will remind you that you should think about life and love with the wonder and ambitions you did as a child.",1384732800,,865,3.9371428571428573
