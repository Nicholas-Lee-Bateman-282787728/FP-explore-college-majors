8348434,5,B00203IFMU,"I may never ride around the world on my Harley, but this video, along with others in the series, gives great advice on motorcycle travel in general. There are great tips on what to take & where to place it on the bike. Interviews with experienced travelers lends credence to the series, even though there are contradictory opinions on some topics. Everyone needs to choose what's best personally. I do wish there were closed captions, as some people had heavy accents & talked fast, so it was hard for me to understand them. Great series.",1371340800,,538,4.673684210526316

8348436,4,B00203IFMU,Successfully whetted the appetite for some adventure riding somewhere. Although I still find it hard to see how so many take so much time out for their holidays/vacations. Hidden/old money? Shares? An ability to feed on rice alone perhaps? :) DVD is a good guide along with a browse of horizonsunlimited's [...],1319846400,2,311,5.0
8348437,5,B00203IFMU,"If you have ever dreamed of jumping on your bike and traveling, even to the ends of the earth, this DVD set is for you.  These are the guys and girls who have not only dreamed it, but have been there, done that, printed the tee shirts and issued them to the ones who came after.  While they may not have invented long distance motorcycle travel, they have certainly taken it to new and glorious heights.  These DVDs are packed with information and motivation...be careful, after watching these you WILL want to quit your job, pack your bike (lightly, of course) and hit the road for foreign lands.  Ever heard of Lesotho?  They have been there.  Thought of riding from Deadhorse to Ushuaia?  They've done that.  Ride around the world?  They wrote the book.  Literally.  And here they show YOU how to do it.  This is a great addition to your video library, put together by people who know the subject, and starring a whole plethora of experienced motorcycle travelers.  Get all 5 volumes, you WILL enjoy them.",1304553600,2,1008,4.595505617977528
8348438,5,B00203IFMU,"If you have read any books about taking long trips on a motorcycle, whether it be to camp with friends, take a vacation/holiday break, or if you dream of something much more exotic such as a visit to other countries or continents - watch this first!!

The whole series (I believe that there are now 5 DVDs in total) all reinforce each other.  They include the famous (Ted Simon, Dr. Greg Frazier), to the typical average middle aged motorcycle rider.  The tales and experiences are fun to listen to, and great to learn from.

Each of the DVDs are very well presented and organized.  Each DVD menu is organized with  topics that resemble a very useful table of contents, making it clear and easy to jump from topic to topic (if you are skimming subjects for instance), or if you need to stop and then restart it at a later date.

Buy one or buy them all, according to taste and your needs.  Read reviews of them here, or browse through the website [...] where Grant and Susan Johnson host one of the most useful motorcycle travel websites in the globe.

My personal thanks to them for making this and the other ""Acheivable Dream"" DVDs, over-committing themselves to making and delivering the series means that the motorcycling community has a wonderful, permanent reference series.  Cheers,  Adrian C. Wright",1281312000,3,1307,4.68859649122807
8348439,5,B00203IFMU,"My wife and I have gone from armchair observers of Ewen & Charlie to actively planning a year-long or more trip, and this dvd series is the primary reason we became convinced it was a possibility for us. After watching this, you realize that you - yes, YOU - can do this. You don't need a chase vehicle, a $30,000 monster bike or Dakar experience.

The videos are chock full of everyday folks who just decided to go for it, and their toothy grins and wonderful stories give you an electric shock in the backside every few minutes. There is so much knowledge passed on during these videos that I guarantee you will need to watch them several times just to absorb it all. You'd need several years of travel to get this much experience, and you can soak it up in the comfort of your own home, at your own pace.

Brilliant! Highly recommended!",1278720000,2,839,4.406451612903226
8348440,5,B00203IFMU,"If you are thinking about doing a long trip then the best thing you can do is start with this video. It is a well thought out and organized discussion of how people did it and what they think was important. They talk about what worked and what didn't as well as how to prepare. There are discussions on what you need ahead of time and what to avoid, all from people who have been there.

This is worth watching for anybody thinking about a trip and for anybody getting ready to go. If your thinking about it this will help make the descision by providing a move accurate picture of what you are considering. If you have made up your mind then this will help to make sure you have covered all of the bases by pointing out what people found important and what problems they ran into.

This video is the best cost savings measure you could invest in",1278374400,2,846,4.248447204968944

8348442,5,B00203IFMU,"My wife and I toured Europe in the 70's on a motorcycle.  There was very little information specific to motorbike touring available at that time.  We got a map, strapped our backpacks to the sissy bar, put on our ski gloves and parkas and hit the road.  We learned a lot! and had a great time.  Flash forward 35 years and we're planning a South American tour.  This time we'd like to be a little more prepared and the Achievable Dream videos are Great.  While our 70's experience proves anyone can do it with little or no prep or special knowledge the DVD's provide a world of information that will help you avoid many of the mistakes we made.  I was especially impressed by the high quality of the production.  Hours of interviews with experienced adventure tourers have been skillfully edited into a very entertaining and highly informative presentation.  We enjoyed every minute of it and have learned plenty.  The information is presented in several segments, each with a theme such as travel costs and money, or border crossings and paperwork.  Each of the segments includes interviews with a variety of experienced travelers giving their perspective on dealing with the subject.  Best of all, in most cases they don't all agree - so you get a variety of views on how to proceed and what you can expect. Each segment concludes with suggestions for where you can get additional information specific to the subject.  As I said - entertaining and informative.  The most motorcycle fun you'll have off your bike.",1273449600,2,1513,4.769230769230769
