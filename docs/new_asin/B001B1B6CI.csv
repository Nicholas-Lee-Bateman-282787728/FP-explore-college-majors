8281241,3,B001B1B6CI,This was probbly the best new HDNet fights dvd out now. I have not seen any of the IFL HDNet dvds yet!! This had some ok to good fights. The main event is on the first dvd and the you get another event on the second dvd. Now this dvd are stated to be taped on DVR system so the picture isn't great. I would pick up a king of the cage cheap which well have alot more fights.,1256342400,,373,3.7341772151898733
