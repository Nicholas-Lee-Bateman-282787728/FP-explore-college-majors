7875855,5,6304670117,"I thought that I would write a review of Karaoke Favorites, Volume 1 for DVD because there isn't a lot of information about these DVD discs.  This volume contains a variety of songs both new and old by male and female artists including: Exhale, Barely Breathing, Have a Heart, Unbreak My Heart, White Christmas, You Don't Bring Me Flowers, Friends in Low Places, I Saw Her Standing There, Cracklin' Rosie, My Way, Sailing, and Brown Eyed Girl.  This DVD title is a high quality production by Pioneer and I liked the the videos that they provide for each song.  They offer a diversion that complements the song without being distracting. The words appear on the television screen over top of the video and are easy to read and follow.  There is also an option to listen to vocalists perform songs, but they seem to be short segments rather than the full version.  If you have a DVD player and like karaoke, I would recommend this title. The disc can play through any DVD player and does not include any regional encoding.
