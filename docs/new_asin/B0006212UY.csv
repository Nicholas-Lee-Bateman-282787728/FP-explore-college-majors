2158174,4,B0006212UY,"Boston's Museum of Fine Arts showed the film NOI ALBINOD a while back, and it looked intriguing, but I missed it and had to wait until the DVD release. Now that I have had the chance to view it, I found it a curious mixture of comedy and heartache and highly original. The film tells the story of an alienated youth who is misunderstood by those around him, a familiar enough genre, but it tells the story in a fresh way. The film's setting is a small town in Iceland and is probably what we would stereotypically think of small town life in this region of the world. It is cold all the time, there is plenty of snow on the ground, and the overall atmosphere is bleak. Noi is someone we would expect to meet in such a town. He may have dreams larger than his community, but we do not see evidence of it though we would not be surprised if this is the case. I'm not sure it's all that easy to sympathize with Noi, but in many ways this is why the film is so masterful. Noi is disconnected from the world and the filmmaker makes the viewer feel his disconnection. His lovable, but somewhat daft grandmother is the only caring figure in his life and has the responsibility of raising him. His father is drunk most of the time and an overall loser. The closest thing to a mentor in his life is a used bookstore owner who believes Keirkegaard is worthless. He has a daughter Iris who is Noi's love interest. There is no real plotline, and the film does end on a tragic note.

There are also small humorous touches in the film, especially around the food Noi eats. He cannot successfully rob a bank or escape from the police. Iris' father wears a t-shirt that says ""New York F***ing City"" is also an amusing detail.

NOI ALBINOD is probably not a film I will watch over and over again, but it is a movie that captures a viewer's interest and makes a person think.

Enjoy!",1111276800,10,1865,4.277620396600566
2158175,4,B0006212UY,"In the spare and poetic ""Noi the Albino,"" the title character is a seventeen-year-old gifted underachiever who lives with his grandmother in a dreary little village on the coast of northern Iceland.  This would be a harsh, isolated environment for anyone to grow up in, but it is particularly trying for a misfit adolescent with few social skills and no real hope for the future.  Noi, whose generally aloof, alcoholic father lives on his own in a different part of town, spends most of his time trudging purposelessly through the snowy streets of the village or holing up in the basement room he's carved out for himself as a kind of sanctuary from a world too utterly depressing to contemplate.  Bored by school and bereft of friends, this young man drifts through life, dreaming of the day when he will be able to live on a very different kind of island in the South Seas, a location light years removed from this place where the interiors are every bit as stark and forbidding as the white-on-white world outside.

""Noi the Albino"" is one of those films in which the very lack of anything significant happening becomes the central theme and message of the work.  Noi lives a life that is so uneventful and boring that it would drive virtually any one of us to the brink of madness.  We hardly blame him when we see him dozing through his classes at school or pilfering change from a mock slot machine set up in the local restaurant.  Yet, despite the fact that virtually nothing of consequence happens, the film itself is a fascinating mood piece that seeps into our bones and makes us sympathize with the plight of the strange young man who occupies center stage in the drama.  Most of the adults in Noi's life seem to sense his potential, but, for some reason, he is totally unwilling to tap into it.  What's impressive about the film is that it doesn't try to explain why that is, though we sense it has something to do with the stifling environment in which he lives.  Noi becomes emblematic of all people who lead lives of quiet desperation, tucked away in remote, virtually uninhabitable corners of the globe, far removed from the bustle and excitement that can be found only in places with large and diverse populations.

As Noi, Tomas Lemarquis gives a beautiful, subtle performance, creating a compelling and complex character using little more than body language and facial expressions.  The final moments of the film are truly heartbreaking as Noi learns the value of what he has - even though, at that point, the realization comes too late.

Written and directed by Dagur Kari with an artist's eye for lyricism and austerity, this is a bleak but intriguing little film that will stay in your mind long past the closing credits.",1111190400,16,2743,4.689583333333333
2158176,4,B0006212UY,"Noi is an introverted teenager who's very intelligent almost bordering on genius, but because most people around him can't understand him, they think he's slow. He lives reclusively with no friends, a strange grandmother who he hardly communicates with, and an alcoholic father who he finds himself parenting. Noi is bored out of his skull living in a dreary Icelandic town. He tries to amuse himself by getting drunk; chasing the only girl they show in the film, and rebelling in school. The film although moving slow had eeriness, filmed purposely with greenish hues over the icy landscapes and mountains to make the audience feel the coldness and bleakness of Noi's life and that of Iceland, which was quite effective and sent a chill into your bones. The plot was simple and dark and then comes the avalanche that unfortunately kills everyone in town except Noi and then he is set free.",1106265600,3,890,4.8618421052631575
2158177,4,B0006212UY,"Ni Albini is the story of a young man out of place in his small town life. He's a genius, but the type that everybody thinks is really an idiot. He's just under stimulated.
The film is a series of incidents and scenes, often amusing, usually quirky. For instance, I like the scene where Ni's schoolfriend brings a tape recorder and places it on Ni's desk. When the teacher asks, the friend explains that Ni couldn't make it that day. Or the part when Ni discovers his grandmother playing the violin in the wardrobe to avoid disturbing her dead husband.
This is the sort of thing you can expect. There isn't much of a story as such. But the ending is unexpected and unsettling.
Fans of Icelandic culture will be happy (although as the director explains, this is in no way meant to be a realistic portrayal of life in Iceland), and you'll see some nice snowy landscapes. But the star of the film by a big margin is Ni himself, brilliantly played with great understatement. An albino he is not, but he looks different enough for this detail not to matter.
The film is paced slow, but not boringly so. It is full of detail and undercurrents of meaning. I liked it a lot. It leaves an impression.
The DVD has plenty of extras, like interviews with a very nervous seeming director, and scenes that he cut out.",1104796800,5,1303,4.456066945606694
2158178,5,B0006212UY,"This is a great film... at times a black comedy, at others, absurd, poignant and dramatic.  A quote on the box cover likens the film to Donnie Darko or Rushmore (which are two strange movies to liken to each other in the first place) and that's hard to understand in any tangible sense, other than that all three center around a bizarre teenager.  There are more parallels with Donnie Darko, but nothing very close.

This film is somehow escapes being depressing and falling off into psychotic melodrama (like Rosie or The Princess and the Warrior), and doesn't push any message to center stage, and avoids the pitfalls of becoming a morality piece or some sappy tale of a misfit.

It's really well done and will have you thinking on it for quite some time.  The scenery is bleak, yet interesting.  The soundtrack is wonderful and the acting is quite good.",1102896000,6,856,4.673333333333333

2158180,5,B0006212UY,"This is a delightful movie about an aimless teenager who is frustrated by the monotony of life in a remote part of Iceland.  The slow pace of the movie along with frequent landscape shots help convey how oppressive and bleak life in this remote town is... but this is NOT a boring movie is infused with subtle humor and pathos.  If you liked ""Songs from the Second Floor"" or ""The Man Without a Past"", then you will like this movie.",1101772800,2,431,4.375
2158181,1,B0006212UY,"This 2003 Icelandic film is about a 17-year old boy who happens to be an Albino, and who leads a bleak life.  The town is small.  The landscape is cold and dreary.  And everybody seems unhappy.

Noi lives with his grandmother.  His alcoholic father lives nearby.  School bores him and he falls asleep in class.  But yet, when a school psychiatrist tries to interview him, Noi plays with a Rubik Cube and solves the puzzle in a very short time.

Noi meets a girl. of course. and they plan on running away together.

I'm not sure how the film ended though because the bleakness and the boredom of life in the little Icelandic town made me fall asleep and miss the last 20 minutes.  When I woke up, I had no interest in watching the end.

This film wins the prize as being the most boring and slow that I've ever seen.",1100304000,4,815,4.296052631578948
2158182,5,B0006212UY,"(This rating is based upon the dvd No Albino, released in Iceland.)

This movie is wonderfully subtle, dark and beautiful. The opening scene is amazing. Dagur Kri has definitely done an incredible job.

I did not realize this film's international potential when I was visiting Iceland last summer and i picked this movie up, but i was amazed at how stunning the flick is. It's not so surprising that, after 101 Reykjavk, more attention is paid to iceland's limited film industry.

I will also have to say that the soundtrack is excellent! Pick that up as well if you like Iron and Wine or 'Bonnie Prince Billy'.",1097280000,12,611,4.691588785046729
2158213,5,B0006212UY,I really enjoyed this film. The irony of him daydreaming about leaving one island for another isolated island really cracked me up. You really connect with the people in the film and it sticks with a theme I'm noticing in a handful of icelandic films I've watched recently of having an unexpected ending... Seagull's Laughter and the Juniper Tree are similar in that way.,1191283200,,371,4.8125
2158214,4,B0006212UY,"Noi is definitely one of the most original movies I've seen, even if it's not completely to my taste. It's about the eponymous title character, a troubled youth looking for a way to make sense of his life. Noi lives with his grandmother and alcoholic father. He rarely goes to school, and consistently does poorly on his assignments. Nothing seems to go right for our anti-hero, as he has a bad relationship with his father, and is eventually expelled from school. His only window of hope is the new girl at the gas station, Iris, who he clearly takes an affection to. Noi's attempts to find a way out of his boring life become so desparate that he may only destroy his life in the process. In the end, he faces an uncertain future after a tragic event, which I will not reveal here. Suffice it to say that the ending offers hope, but hardly makes everything right.

""Noi"" is a real treat for fans of European cinemas. It has great acting (though I didn't believe for a minute that Tmas Lemarquis was 17, as Noi is supposed to be) and a non-cliched script. Plus, it gives a ""slice of life"" picture of Iceland, a place that most Americans know very little about. In addition, ""Noi"" is an interesting take on the coming of age genre, and handles alcoholism and domestic violence in a surprisingly realistic manner. Furthermore, ""Noi"" reminds me of ""Five Easy Pieces"" in that it features a title character trying to make sense out of an apparently senseless life. The only caveat is that there are no real significant events, unless you want to count what happens at the end, and so someone expecting a drama in the vein of ""Lives of Others"" will be disappointed. It's really a character study. So in sum, ""Noi"" is recommended for those who are looking for something different.",1190851200,,1774,4.578616352201258

2158216,3,B0006212UY,"This film from Iceland is about a 17-year old Albino called Noi (played by an actor who doesn't look either like an albino or a 17 year old) living on an oppresively dull small town in an isolated fjord. Noi, meanwhile, has problems in school, has problems with his parents, hangs out in a bookstore (the town's only, presumably) owned by a cranky old man and is in love with the beautiful waitress of the bar in the gas station. The movie itself is sort of interesting, has droll humor to spare, but at the end, seems to be too much in love with its own quirkiness. And, what should we make of the fact that (SPOILER ALERT: DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN THE MOVIE AND PLAN TO WATCH IT) most of the people Noi cares for die at the end as a result of an avalanche.",1176422400,,773,4.16
2158217,5,B0006212UY,"Noi is a seventeen year old teenager who lives with his grandmother. He is rebellious on a personal level regarding school and his personal habits, he smokes and drinks. He is not exactly disrespectful but simply is an individual who follows his own inclinations which has a tendency to get him into trouble. The fjord in Iceland where he lives is limited ... His father is an alcoholic and there is no background given regarding his mother. The film contrasts the stark cold climate in which he lives with the emotional disconnection he feels on the whole about life. Noi feels constrained, he wants something else but does not see a way out. The film explores his personal behavior and how it affects those around him ... It is a deep and haunting film which has an unexpected shake-up type ending. However the ending is open-ended. It leaves the viewer hanging, to ponder how Noi may use the experience to grow into maturity and adulthood or it may be the curve which drives him into the depths of despair. Whichever path he chooses, the event which happened will seriously affect him for the remainder of his life ...

Before this disastrous event, he challenges authority and gets involved with petty crime. He meets an attractive girl named Iris, who is visiting her father from the south of Iceland. It seems she needs to get away from city life according to her father. She jokes about wanting to leave Iceland and explore the world. Noi takes her litterally, walking together one night, he breaks the glass door to the local museum where they nearly get caught by the guards. They find an interactive map which lets them see what different parts of the world are like ... After this date, he buys new clothes, steals a car, and goes to meet Iris, challenging her to make a break with him. She sees the absurdity of this action and can't believe he took her seriously ... His brother bails him out of jail ... Prior to this, he was expelled from school for playing hookey too often. Just when it seems Noi has reached the end of his rope, a turning point, disaster strikes, his world is shaken up and nearly destroyed. This is a haunting and existential film which explores the depths of one lonely teenager's life ... and makes him face the realities of life.

2158219,4,B0006212UY,"Noi the Albino (Dagur Kari, 2003)

This film has a most unexpected deus-ex-machina--an avalanche. One of the most helpless endings I've watched in my entire life. The story takes place in a remote town in the north of Iceland. The sense of desolation is simply overwhelming. The mountain from the beginning looms ominous. Seventeen year old Noi live within a very small network of people. He is loved, but he is lost. No wonder. There is not much future imaginable in this town.

He rejects school, he rejects work. A desire for evasion is secretly burning but without consequences. When he finally tries to do something, he fails. And on that night, his entire ""community"" is destroyed. He is left with a toy viewer through which he dreams of Hawai'i. The end.

Oh, but Iceland. How can I not be intrigued by the country. I'll be there one day. One day, si dios quiere!

One thing of special interest. The rainbow hangs very LOW in Iceland.",1128816000,2,941,4.650602409638554

2158221,5,B0006212UY,"Noi is truly one of those films that intentionally has a purpose to make you ambivalent and get mixed feelings about the character and the story itself. And it's also one of those films that is intentionally slow so that you can actually relate to how the character feels. It doesn't hinder the plot or dig holes in it, everything that the film shows on the screen has a purpose, regardless if it may seem pointless or flat on the surface. Everything from the very stark scenery of Iceland, the dull depiction of the environment, and the sometimes strange characters is meant to shock, amaze, and surprise us. This is real filmmaking. Although the director didn't intentionally make a realistic depiction of Iceland, you can still somewhat admire the ethereal and strange aurora that is emitted on the screen. If only most films were this original, unique, and artistic. What's also great about this film are the DVD extras, a great bonus to such a very haunting and profound film! It's funny, sad, heart aching, and most of all, believable. I highly recommend it.",1117670400,3,1064,4.788043478260869
2158222,5,B0006212UY,"This film was unique and profound. Its underlying messages are very humanistic... people in their most passionate moments can relate to this boy's urge to escape, to claim his freedom, to run faster than the law. The movie is slow at first, but sets up a feeling of redundancy and of being trapped on an unhospitable frozen island. Noi is largely expressionless and is hard to understand until the end, when his true nature is revealed. His most desperate and frantic attempt to escape ends in irony. The fact that he embarasses himself, empties his bank account, and steals a car would make for one of two desireable outcomes from such extreme measures; Either he succeeds, or the world as he knows it ends. This movie carries subtle mysticism and a sort of poetic justice, in which Noi really does get what he asks for, to have a new life away from such boredom, albeit not as pleasantly as planned.",1114560000,3,901,4.6375

8036678,4,B0006212UY,"Noi Albinoi is a film by 1st time Icelander,Dagur Kari,shot in NW Iceland. It's about 17 year old Noi,a misfit who genuinely is a total outsider to the small village community by a remote ford. With his bald head and great staring eyes,his incuriosity about adapting to norms of behaviour at school,his bad time-keeping,his isolation from the conditioning of his fellow pupils. He lives with his grandmother,and sees his father periodically,an alcoholic. He dreams of escape from this snow-bound grotto, with its lack of mobile phones,computers in this timeless landsape. All he seems able to get hold of (almost the toy things of another age) are a View-Finder,with its views of Hawaii,a Rubik cube,which he does in two minutes,and a game of Fortress he plays with the bookshop owner. Some of the teachers at school are threatening to resign if he is not expelled. He is reliant on his grandmother to get him off to school.

His only solace is a girl,Iris,a pretty young city girl who works in a local gas station and caf. She reminds him that this isn't all there is,there's another life outside and elsewhere,if he chooses to go. Tomas Lemarquis gives a standout performance as the film's oddball antihero. He now and again has a beer or two,or attempts to trick a fruit machine into paying out a win. His relationship with his dad is a bit like a role reversal with him playing the caring father figure. His attempts to break out have a comical episode where he attempts to hold up a bank,only for him to have the gun wrestled out of his hand by the baker,and him being kicked out. He also goes with his father for a drink in a night bar. He's not allowed alcohol,only a lemonade,which he attempts to pour out whisky into from his own concealed spirit bottle,while his dad sings Elvis's In the Ghetto. He is ejected from there. He gets hold of his dad's car and attempts to get the girl to run away with him,but she was only joking. He ends up in a cell.

He has a secret hiding place beneath the floor where he goes to escape,have a cigarette and daydream. One day he takes his girl and they break into the local museum which houses many stuffed animals. Beneath this wry existentialist comedy a tragedy is pushing to the fore,based on a catastrophe,which could go either way into more gloom or greater liberation. The tone of the film is cool bluey-green, a detachment which leads to eccentric characterisation of minor parts. There's a feeling of being at the end of the world,being unable to articulate in words what's wrong, just rubbing along until something happens or someone shows up. Kari's direction is not based on plotting a narrative at all,but stringing episodes together randomly. He'd been sitting on this material for 10 years,before getting a crew of friends together. This is an offbeat coming-of-age tale with a darkly comic twist.",1421107200,,2856,4.732931726907631
8036679,5,B0006212UY,"Cold, barren, snow covered Iceland. Our main character--teenage Noi. Noi lives with his grandmother and occasionally sees his out-of-touch alcohol-problem father. Noi is a high school kid with aloof dreams that involve him not being in his small Icelandic town during the winter. He wants to reach out but does not know how. His teachers degrade him in a nonchalant way, his friends isolate him, and he seems to be a loner with no future. The movie is set and made to be timeless, as in you don't know what era or year the movie takes place. Backgrounds, props, dress, and everything else seems to be dateless and numberless. That concept plays as the movie progresses until the final ending.

Noi seems to have a stroke of genius about him: playing mastermind and winning in the minimal number of moves, solving the Rubic's Cube while being interviewed by the school psychologist. In the end, Noi does become free...or does he?

path. Steals everyday from the local restaurant's slot machine that never has a customer. Meets beautiful girl who works at this restaurant. He teaches her to smoke-dumb then break into the local Icelandic museum together because they are freezing their butt off.

Botched bank robbery and bummer avalanche and Noi is off to Hawaii. The end.

This exceeded my expectations. Actually, this kooky Iceland film is worth the admission price in an arty theater.

Am not connected to this film in any way, shape or form. Am sure the character Noi at so and so focal length looks like my wife who has been dead for 25 years. This ain't no coincidence. The actor who played Noi can not help it.

There is no snowcap on Icelandic mountains that are not very tall. Iceland should be Thawedland.
Of course they have Coke and Marlboro cigarettes. They have 3D cinema

Ni is a teenager living in Bolungarvk, in the far northwest of Iceland. He wants to leave because he feels foreign to everything around him, and a picture of a cuban beach in the caribbean confirms to him that ""there's more to life than this"", like one of Bjrk's songs goes. He finds motivation when he meets ris, with whom he decides to leave. Up until now, it sounds like your average teenage film, but it's the mood set by the scarcely populated village, the sparse music, the boring life led by the local villagers what makes you sympathize with Ni and, ultimately, feel like him, when the movie ends.

It is very much a character study, magnificently atmospheric,  set in the frozen backwaters of Iceland.
