5730399,5,B00CMQLA04,"Dont get me wrong  Im a huge fan of Downton.  But not so blinded by its periodic dollops of saccharine dosed wish-fulfillment that Im convinced this is what life must have been like for the average person in the early years of the Twentieth Century.  For anyone who is BBCs The Village will definitely provide the necessary antidote!

And it makes for suitably grim viewing as we witness the everyday domestic dramas of both high and low lived out against the backdrop of the Great War; the high personified by local gentry, the Allinghams, embodying all of the entitlement of the upper classes; the low personified by the Middletons, a (subsistence) farming family presided over by John (John Simm) and Grace (Maxine Peake) whose eldest son, Joe, goes off to fight.

The period detail, as might be expected from the BBC, is excellent, and the Peak District setting, at times, quite spectacular.  Like all period dramas, it has its stock characters; its heroes and villains at which we are encouraged to either cheer or boo at appropriate moments in the story.

Nevertheless, this is a brilliant slice of fictionalized social history coming, as it does, at an apposite time, commemorating, as we are, the centenary of the start of the war to end all wars; and all delivered by a top-notch cast.",1407888000,5,1294,4.801801801801802
5730400,5,B00CMQLA04,"It's clear that U.K. writer Peter Moffat knows what he's writing about in his depiction of working-class village life at the turn of the previous century. His Scottish grandfather and great-grandfather were shepherds (""Doctor Who"" fans, he is unrelated to Steven Moffat). An enormous feature of ""The Village"" series is its topography. Cinematographer David Odd captures a landscape where nothing is straight. The stone walls are the bones of the land, green with lichen and moss, seemingly holding the land together under a vast cloud-driven sky. Absolutely beautiful. Moffat's wonderful narrator, Old Bert Middleton (David Ryall), begins this story as the 2nd oldest man in Britain (and by episode 3, the 1st oldest dies-off). Vivid writing and a fine cast create an utterly believable world.

The summer of 1914 was the first time ever a bus came to Bert's Derbyshire village, no one expected anyone to actually get off. Young Bert Middleton (exquisitely played by Bill Jones) was only 12 years old, but he fell in love immediately with new arrival, young Martha Lane (Charlie Murphy). He still loves her 100 years later. Bert's older brother Joe (perfectly portrayed by Manchester native Nico Mirallegro), is a servant in the Big House and he also falls for Martha. Both boys are afraid of their tormented father John, a drunken Peak District farmer (the always remarkable John Simm, catch the Manchester drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-On-Mars-U-K/dp/B0038M2SAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life On Mars (U.K.)</a>).

Maxine Peake is mesmerizing in her powerful performance as the long-suffering boy's mother, Grace Middleton (see her in Moffat's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Criminal-Justice/dp/B008PDAG3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Criminal Justice</a>). Grace is a ballast for her family.

Old Bert is asked what his childhood was like. His answer: ""Short."" What made it short? Wryly, he says, ""Being poor and being hungry."" This first collection covers the period from 1914 to 1920, with the harrowing fallout from World War I, with tragic consequences to the Middleton family, the entire village, and Bert's gentle schoolteacher Mr. Eyre (Matt Stokoe), who protects him from a bullying colleague. Eyre gifts the teenaged Bert (Alfie Stewart) with a camera, and we are thus treated to ""historic"" photos of a lost time. A menacing character is Detective Stephen Bairstow, darkly played by Joe Armstrong (we noticed an uncanny resemblance to another great U.K. actor, Alun Armstrong, and later discovered why).

Thankfully, there is a second series in the works for 2014; this will progress the series into the 1920s. There is speculation that future series may also be created, to cover World War II, and possibly post-war Britain. We look forward to more!

5730418,2,B00CMQLA04,"The most notable defect in the series is a lack of subtitles. The dialects of England are the most difficult for the rest of the English speaking populations of the world to clearly pickup pronunciations, vocabulary, and grammar. Irish and Scottish are actually easier, especially to North American and Aussie ears. It was compounded by uneven audio levels and poor enunciation, thus a lot of important dialogue was missed. Not to mention to those with hearing issues.

Most of the one and two star reviewers mention that the Downton Abbey resemblance is misleading and I would agree with that. One of the
storyline's core themes is the effect of war, specifically WWI, on the minds of the young men when asked to kill and also face being killed. It
is well known, especially for that war, that the personal act of killing created many psychological, moral and military obstructions. The film showed some  of that turmoil, but didn't show its scope and depth. Also mentioned in those  reviews was the series' excessive emphasis on the discordant, depressing  and dark side of village life. True, but maybe not far from the truth.

5730422,2,B00CMQLA04,"found it dreary, depressing, and very, very slow.

To be fair, the actors had a tough job to do, and they did it very well. But the good acting wasn't enough to overcome what for us became an overdose of nastiness and misery.

There doesn't seem to be consistency in the story, extended scenes that drag on, and characters that are just not appealing.  Maybe this is one person's view of what was happening from 1915 - 1918, but I found it disturbing - not so much for the circumstances of the people in the village, but where the writer chose to emphasize the dramatic scenes.

5730462,5,B00CMQLA04,"The best fictional WWI series created for quite some time.
Captivating and never a slow moment in this plot-packed 6-episode biography of one man's memory of life in a small rural English village during WWI. Lead reviewer, FYI, has done a good job; I'll just try to add a bit of other info as to why I'm waiting on pins and needles for the next season on DVD. I bought my copy used, and found it had:

NO SUBTITLES--NO CLOSED CAPTIONS. Often the case, unfortunately, with BFS. But the dialects is not too hard to follow.

The cast is loaded with seasoned stars and they do a worthy job of displaying individual characters, some you love, some you loathe; as intended with the writing. Much of the plot threads beyond war issues comes with women working, relationships between classes, and relationships between neighbors. Again some are due to love, others spawned by hatred. Remember, this is the story of 1914-1920 as seen through the eyes of a young boy, one not old enough to go to war, only to be touched by older people who did, those who objected, those that died, and a lifestyle that included want, hunger, and poverty. Not pretty always, but touching, poignant.
Cinematography is outstanding. Violence, war, brief nudity, and adult situations makes this adult recommended.

1 ==At age 100, Bert Middleton (David Ryall) recollects his summer of 1914. He faces life with an abusive dad, John (John Simm `Life on Mars'); passive mother Grace (Maxine Peake -`Little Dorrit'), looks up to brother Joe (Nico Mirallegro). The rich family includes Lady Clem Allingham (Juliet Stevenson -`Emma' `Politician's Wife'); her spoiled-to-illness daughter Caro (Emily Beecham -plays a difficult role well); young son George (Augustis Prew -`Borgias') and older son Edmund (Rupert Evans -`Emma'). Kind schoolmaster Eyre (Matt Stokoe) severely contrasts to Bert's teacher Ingham (Stephen Walters). Martha Lane ( Charlie Murphy -`Philomena')arrives on the first bus through town becoming quite the village radical. Grace's friend Margaret (Annabelle Apsion -`Doc Martin') is flawless in so many types of emotional scenes. (Anthony Flanagan) starts a boot factory, (Ainsley Howard) his wife. That's not all but a load of top talent, most of which will return in Series Two.
2 ==John's farm fails and he drinks. Romances and wanton relations abound. Caro reveals pregnancy and the dad.

5730463,1,B00CMQLA04,"Just watched the first episode, which was god-awful. Clearly, the writers and director have a bone to pick with traditional village life, which is depicted as unbelievably harsh, brutal, and primitive. There is no effort to get into the world of the characters--to show them as both good and bad. Instead, these people are portrayed as stupid, callous, vicious, and selfish.

There are so many nasty characters: the alcoholic father, who locks the younger son in the linen closet because (I guess) he looks at his older brother, who the father is angry at for some reason that is not clear, the dreadful schoolmaster (there is a vicious but unconvincing scene in which the young-boy character's left hand is whipped because (I guess) he is required to write with his right hand but won't or can't--who knows? We're not told).

Perhaps the dumbest stereotype is the daughter who lives in the ""big house,"" who always seems to have a dachshund dog in her arms and acts so inanely as to seem totally unbelievable and cartoonish. In fact, all the family living in the big house are portrayed unpleasantly in various ways. One senses the writers are out to show the ""nostalgic inauthenticity"" of Downton Abbey. Good luck, guys!

There is little narrative arc in the first episode--just a series of unrelated vignettes that are hackneyed (e.g., the young-boy character looking through a shale roof shingle (that just happens to be lose) to see the naked women bathing beneath (would a village this small have a public bath?).

The episode ends with the older brother going off to WWI, but frankly the episode has been so uninteresting up to this point, who really cares?

Don't spend money on this series. Terribly disappointing. So much possibility but sabatoged by a kind of Marxist/poststructural ideology that wishes to show traditional, pre-modern life as absolutely vicious, hard, and awful.

Sadly, BBC too often generates these series created by cerebral highbrows who have little sense of real life. Oddly, this episode (and I guess others) begins with an old, old man who actually is the younger-boy character in the dramatization. This old guy seems jovial and kindly, but none of this living generosity or pleasure of recollecting the past comes through in the actual episode. How this series got renewed for a 2nd season is beyond me.

One of the blurbs on the DVD box compares the series to Downton Abbey. No way. That series has deep, deep heart. This series has only superficial, highbrow hardheartedness.",1419897600,23,2514,4.957244655581948
5730464,4,B00CMQLA04,I am a history buff especially of British drama.  The Village was very good and I would highly recommend it.  Each character played an exceptional role especially the mother.  She is a very strong person who loves her children dearly and does whatever she has to in order to protect them.  The accent was somewhat difficult to understand at times.,1418169600,2,347,4.733333333333333

5730467,5,B00CMQLA04,A perfect companion to Downton Abbey. It's first series covered the WW 1 period. The series covers it from the bottom of society and a landed class family that is obviously below the Downton class. The series is suppose to cover the 20th century from the point of view of the people of this one village. Each episode is introduced by a man who is supposed to be the second oldest man in England and a young boy in the village when the series starts so they are playing it as a story of his life/memories. Not as pretty as Downton but then most of society then wasn't pretty. So far it has avoided explicit sex and unnecessary violence. There is a scene of a boy trying to spy on women bathing but it rather tastefully done and any boy today will see more on any beach. Historical note: Most people did not have bathrooms and villages usually had public bathing rooms which would have hours for women/girls and young children and hours for men/boys. I hope they get to finish the series.,1416096000,34,986,4.39344262295082
5730468,5,B00CMQLA04,"The Village is not to be missed.

Both the Village and The Mill are exceptional . They are great stories and very true the era they deal with. Although tough subject
matter the stories are riveting and kept my glued throughout . Casting was spot on not a weak actor in either series. Hope they
will both have a second season. Great to see quality like this , thanks for offering these English dramas for us in the US.",1415836800,6,417,4.2784810126582276

Some of these people lived in The Village although this series picks up on the lives of the people living there years later during the 20 century. I find it difficult to understand the spoken English accents at times during this series, but all in all I thinks it's pretty well done. I'm looking forward to series 2.",1411776000,35,491,4.23404255319149
5730472,5,B00CMQLA04,"Don't get me wrong - I'm a huge fan of Downton. But not so blinded by its periodic dollops of saccharine dosed wish-fulfillment that I'm convinced this is what life must have been like for the average person in the early years of the Twentieth Century. For anyone who is, BBC's The Village will definitely provide the necessary antidote!

And it makes for suitably grim viewing as we witness the everyday domestic dramas of both high and low lived out against the backdrop of the Great War; the high personified by local gentry, the Allinghams, embodying all of the entitlement of the upper classes; the low personified by the Middletons, a (subsistence) farming family presided over by John (John Simm) and Grace (Maxine Peake) whose eldest son, Joe, goes off to fight.

The period detail, as might be expected from the BBC, is excellent, and the Peak District setting, at times, quite spectacular. Like all period dramas, it has its stock characters; its heroes and villains at which we are encouraged to either cheer or boo at appropriate moments in the story.

Nevertheless, this is a brilliant slice of fictionalized social history. It comes at an apposite time, commemorating, as we are, the centenary of the start of the `war to end all wars'- and all delivered by a top-notch cast.",1410393600,94,1289,4.823529411764706

8583525,1,B00CMQLA04,"If the first 30 minutes of this movie are anything like the rest, be warned.  There is child abuse that
is very disturbing to watch.  The father is a mental case and abuses his 2 sons both verbally
and physically.  The wife stands by mute.  Then there is his school teacher who uses a
switch to beat the young boy's hand to a pulp for a very minor 'infraction' -- not knowing some
obscure phrase.  It goes from bad to worse .. very unrealistic and depressing.  (I usually
sell my dvds to Bookman's if one viewing is enough:  This one I trashed.  I don't want
someone else to buy it.) None of the characters are in any believable -- from the so-
called 'gentry' to the 'laborer.'  It is a movie from hell.",1474502400,2,704,4.2330827067669174
