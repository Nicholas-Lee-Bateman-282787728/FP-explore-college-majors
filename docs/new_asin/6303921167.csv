7855015,4,6303921167,"This movie is about several women & their different attempts at having children. Lindsay Wagner plays a woman ending an uncommitted relationship, left to find another route to motherhood. She seriously considers the available technology, while her friend chooses adoption. The movie attempts to portray the emotional and practical considerations involved in the major decisions of creating a family. I definitely recommend this movie.",1245888000,,434,5.796875

7855017,5,6303921167,"A great episode of Amazing Animals that is truelly entertaining and funny, like the rest of this great series. Personally I think this series should be released onto DVD season sets.

Who agrees with me? Anyway we should recommend that the complete series is released onto DVD. We must give our children something that is entertaining and informative.",1220140800,3,351,5.051724137931035
7855018,5,6303921167,"Okay, It's pretty obvious why Disney (Who now owns The Jim Henson company) won't give this cartoon a DVD release : They do not want to waste the money to pay for the copyrights to the TV show and Movie clips used in the cartoon. Now, if Disney is worried about losing money, they'd be able to make up for it in DVD Sales. This cartoon was such a BIG Hit that it will sell great if put onto DVD. It certainly is a lot more appropriate than a lot of the cartoons on TV Today. This VHS tape (VHS is so 80's) captures a classic Valentine's day episode. This cartoon rightfully Belongs on DVD",1196553600,10,587,4.113043478260869
7855019,5,6303921167,"I bought The Potty Project for Babies when my daughter was twelve months old, at the suggestion of my great grandmother.  She said before everyone had disposable diapers babies were potty trained by nine months.  Twelve  months is young by traditional standards, but old by Five Star standards.  By the time she was 16 months old she was potty trained during the day.  I  wish I would have heard about this when she was even younger, but as it is,  I'm the envy of all my friends with two and three year old's who aren't  potty trained yet.",964828800,24,540,4.438775510204081
