If you want real meaningful plot then don't bother but if you want a lot of fairly mindless fun this is worth it. My teenage daughter and I watched all of them and I will attest that we both prefer any of the movies to a root canal or even a regular filling.

Mysterious Museum was probably the most kid centric with a valuable lessons ""don't be mean to your little sister"".
Teen Sorcery was pretty dumb and basically a ""mean tenn girls are not as cool as they think"" sort of deal.
Teenage Space Vampires has plot is even dumber than the rest but shows due respect to geeks.

Go for it now. If you get stuck in the airport with a 5 hour delay you can watch all three of them on your laptop. It is better and far less depressing than watching news.

I just wish there was more of the stuff coming.

Besides I am inspired to go watch all the reruns of Andromeda aka Hercules in 'Space if I could manage to dig it up.",1456272000,,1150,4.093333333333334
