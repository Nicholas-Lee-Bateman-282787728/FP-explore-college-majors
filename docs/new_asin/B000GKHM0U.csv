2614750,1,B000GKHM0U,"HATE that UK distributor did not CLEARLY indicate that this is a Region 2 dvd, meaning that you have to change this feature in US whenever you want to play this particular dvd.  Tried to return it, but the cost would have been 3 times the cost of the dvd itself.  Mea culpa, next time BUYER BEWARE!!!  I will try to purchase via US distributor because Abbott & Costello's Hold That Ghost is awesome and really worth it.",1403568000,8,419,4.346153846153846

2614756,5,B000GKHM0U,If anyone took the 2 seconds it takes to READ THE PRODUCT INFO you would clearly see that is says in rather big letters and numbers CODE 2.
