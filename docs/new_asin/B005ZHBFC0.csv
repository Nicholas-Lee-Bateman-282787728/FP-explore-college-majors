4910581,5,B005ZHBFC0,Very informative. A good visual introduction to some workings with the Goetia form of Magick. The guys making this film are deeply steeped in this belief system which gives it more credence.,1351814400,,190,4.96875
8489653,3,B005ZHBFC0,"I've studied psychic/occilt etc etc for many years an had many experiences myself...but this is all RITUAL an really hokey at that...This is around 10minutes of ritual in darkness  and then lots of Q and A that are pretty mundane and not very interesting. The bald guy makes monotone answers like he is a total brainwashed type studying Solomon type magick only 2 years and thinking he can channel spirits--a very dangerous occupation and if he truly IS--then he is a living example of the automatic pilot brain taken by other entities reduced to...rubbish.

which sorts sunms this up...
The Mage guy is shot in DARKNESS ith just a few lights on him to make it more..what? EVIL looking to play to stereotypes? He insists that he is not Satanist because they CONTROL angels and then USE them to control DEMONS. anyone THIS foolish must be either really wanting to ger possessed or so foolish and full of themselves that their own EGO gets them every time.

As I said...NEXT!

OK. NEXT!",1513814400,,984,4.703488372093023
8489654,5,B005ZHBFC0,Anyone who ever wanted to know what real magic is about it's right here in this film. I only had to watch it for 10 minutes to recognize a legitimate magic practitioner. He is a true Elder I have been a shaman and a mage four decades. I know a genuine Elder when I see one and I am highly critical of any kind of representation of witches or magic in film. The presenter is cheesy endlessly cheesy over Hamed overacted to the point that he makes Shatner look chill. However ignore all that if you want to see what real magic is about.,1512000000,,534,4.144230769230769
8489655,1,B005ZHBFC0,This was simply and utterly a waste of time. Don't bother.,1511481600,,58,4.363636363636363
8489656,1,B005ZHBFC0,No,1510531200,,2,2.0
8489657,1,B005ZHBFC0,"Utterly absurd, amateurish, melodramatic, self-absorbed rubbish.  There's nothing deep or mystical or inspiring about any of this; in fact, it's rather embarrassing to watch these half-baked hucksters at work.",1508803200,,209,6.206896551724138
8489658,1,B005ZHBFC0,Easy to see in the Poke answers that he is a con artist.....,1508630400,,60,3.6923076923076925
8489659,3,B005ZHBFC0,"The conversations about God, gods, spirits, demons, etc. are much more interesting than the magical ritual and prophecy interpretations.  This is a slow film.  If you know nothing about magic or magical practices, observing the ritual will enlighten you.  One thing you will see is that we all tend to devise similar rituals of contact, prayer, worship, and divination.  Ritual magic is very much like a deeper, more profound Catholic experience.  Paganism in general is an eclectic mix of respected ideologies, unlike the three organized Abrahamic religions which hold us in their grip in this era.  While they are very closed-minded and fearful of other beliefs, the pagans do a ""Bruce Lee"" and take what works while tossing what is not helpful.  Of course, this is my opinion.  Watch for yourself, but not if you're sleepy.",1504915200,3,826,5.022058823529412
8489660,5,B005ZHBFC0,"I don't believe in any of this garbage (I'm a science guy), but I like to watch stuff about outrageous beliefs, theories, religions, etc people have or participate in, and I found it a bit fascinating.  Definitely not a bad watch.",1494115200,,230,4.609756097560975
8489661,2,B005ZHBFC0,"The film has about 15 minutes of ritual and prophecy and an hour of boring interviews. Some guy named Michael channels the scripted prophecy through a dark mirror and insists on speaking in a boring monotone the whole film. The main mage was the Pat Robertson of the Astarte temple, speaking like that senile uncle who thinks he knows something.

I suppose if you are into the pagan magic thing, this is about was good as it gets, almost Wiccan in their goddess worship. Yes he makes vague prophecies, of which I am certain all will come true.",1418342400,3,543,4.540816326530612
8489662,4,B005ZHBFC0,"This whole dvd is a trip into a world most of us aren't used to seeing, the summoning of an ancient spirit.  The non-believers will discount this I'm sure but this is amazing footage not to be missed.",1383177600,,200,4.2631578947368425
