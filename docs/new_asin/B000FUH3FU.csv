8603261,3,B000FUH3FU,"This video, shot at the 2006 Showest convention, is in three different segments.  The first, which shows the awards show gets below average marks.  The video was shot from a level below the speakers podium, and at times you can see people walking directly in front of the camera!  Only an award show junkie could appreciate that part.

The second shows many different vendors trying to hock their goods to movie theater owners.  The reporter, Sarah Jane, who appeared on American Idol and was a contestant on Jeopardy! does keep this segment interesting with a good sense of humor.  I still haven't seen Pucker Powder in any of the movie theaters I've been to this year, but not all products make it.

The final segment features Kitt Pomodoro at one of the corporate parties.  Kitt does the best she can interviewing guests at the party, and displays a little bit of her Japanese language knowledge.

If you don't own a chain of movie theaters, or, are a fan of any award show, this DVD might not be for you.",1157155200,,1008,4.58659217877095
