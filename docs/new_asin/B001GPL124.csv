8306548,5,B001GPL124,"With the swarm of fans bubbling and gawking over jeff dunham it's easy to understand how people can miss some diamonds in the rough. David Strassman is one of those diamonds. his use of puppetry and comedy together work excellently with the cast he made up to create an entertaining and light hearted show.

PROS:
verry funny standup comedian with puppets

some comedy suited for adults as well as children (the huggable and loveable teddy)

CONS:
if you're not a fan of puppets I would not recommend this dvd

In closing I give Strassman a big thumbs up for his approach to puppet comedy as well as special effects to make a show worth watching over and over again in my library.",1494979200,,680,4.549180327868853

8306553,4,B001GPL124,"For over 30 years the insane mind of David Strassman has been entertaining people all over the world with his ventriloquism act. The most famous of his creations would be that of Chuck Wood; a deranged little puppet boy with a foul mouth who can spit on the crowed, illuminate a devilish red glow from his eyes, insult the audience, insult Dave and insult his colleague puppet Ted E. Bare, who is a shy innocent character that sounds like Forrest Gump and Bert (& Ernie) with the tendency to make audiences go awww, or laugh when he decides to clean his privates.... 'coz he can!

Other puppets include an Alien named Kevin, a Beaver named Sid, A baby that I forget the name of, and in later shows introduced Ted E Bares grandfather, a robotic woman and several other characters.

David does both children and adult versions of his show when he tours, but the versions on the 3 DVD's he has released are all adult shows.

Strassman is American, but he has never really had all that much success in the USA, he is mostly known through the U.K & even bigger in Australia.
Around the mid 1990's, David hosted his own show in both Australia and the U.K called ""Strassman"" where he did skits and interviews with the puppets. Man, I wish they would release those on DVD too.

These days when you think about ventriloquist acts, Jeff Dunham is stealing all the glory. But David Strassman has been around much longer, and in my opinion, is the much better & talented ventriloquist of the two. For anyone who has not seen Strassman, if you ever have the chance to, go and see him, you won't be disappointed, and you will see that you could argue who is better out of him and Jeff Dunham, but I guarantee you will love them both and they will both be in at least your top 2 favorite guys on stage talking to a dummy, and tho not a very talented ventriloquist, but funny as hell, check out Otto & George, if your taste in humor is complete smut and you are not easily offended. (very blue color comedy)

Also on these dvds, they contain bonus features that you really can call bonus features, each feature is a skit, or a documentary, everything is entertainment, so you won't be bored to sleep with behind the scenes footage and a roadie boring you with details about how the lighting effects are rigged up or something like that.

I'm sure it's possible, but I've never come across anyone who knows of, but does not like David Strassman. I was surprised to hear Dave and Chuck Wood do a small bit on the Bob & Tom radio show once, so hopefully someone in America will recognize Strassmans talent and he can become the success in his home country that he has made for himself in Europe and Australia.",1248220800,2,2690,4.435222672064778
8306554,3,B001GPL124,"Like his second video, I appreciated Strassman's talent in ventriloquism.  Not for families or people with more refined taste.",1245715200,,126,5.631578947368421
8306555,5,B001GPL124,"Dave has done it again - no  wonder the entire population of Australia, NZ and the UK love him. Great work.",1225238400,,107,4.095238095238095
8306556,5,B001GPL124,Great fun! What a great DVD! My husband and I couldn't stop laughing at David and all his `personalities'!,1224720000,,106,4.631578947368421
