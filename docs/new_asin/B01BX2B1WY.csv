7670025,4,B01BX2B1WY,"I was shocked when I realized I somehow missed there was! a third season and I bought all 3 seasons of the BBC version of the dashing and gritty musketeers immediately.
I promptly watched in order with Season 3 probably a bit less realistic (yes these musketeers are now full fledged military soldiers and, basically, invincible despite the occasional mortal wounding.)
BUT, still love this redo of the Dumas novel that still has sinister bad men to despise.  Rupert Everett and Mathew McNulty are the conniving political evil doers in the final season.
Athos (Tom Burke) is permitted a formidable love interest, Sylvie, in this go around.
Gotta love how the series strays from the popular movies just enough so you don't know what is going to happen and just who might die among the stars of the show.

4 1/2 star excellent tv production.  Even the ward robe is memorable for the musketeers as is the stand-in Czech Republic exteriors and 17th century towns and castles representing France of the time.
Dont forget to watch extras too!",1524441600,,1036,4.808988764044944

7670034,3,B01BX2B1WY,Disappointing after Seasons 1 + 2. Characters make major OUT-of-Character moves to close out the series. Better for rental than purchase...,1510531200,,139,5.666666666666667

7670040,5,B01BX2B1WY,So disappointed that this will likely be the finale for this show - a really fun exploration into the depths of the original A.

7670047,5,B01BX2B1WY,"I have been waiting and WAITING for this last season on BBC AMERICA, but it has not come! Why? I cannot tell you why they did not or have not shown it. I have Seasons 1 and 2 and I knew there had to be an ending, because I know the legend as do most of you so, this came as a treat to find it on Amazon. The film makers ended the story as it should be, but I enjoyed the acting, the music, the adventure and the pure fun of watching the Musketeers ride again. The film quality is great, I cannot praise it enough. Thanks Amazon for making another of my dreams come true.",1501372800,2,570,3.8803418803418803

7670049,5,B01BX2B1WY,I don't have enough good things to say about this whole series! I am watching it through a 2nd time already! The series is something the whole family can watch (depending on what level of violence you decide is okay for your kids). There is infedelity themes in it as to the time I guess and some suggestive content but no actual sex scenes or nudity. Really wish that more series like this were made more frequently but unfortunately the need to sell with sex is driving movie industry too much.,1501027200,3,496,4.461538461538462

7670068,2,B01BX2B1WY,"Man, I have no idea what show the rest of these folks were watching, but it's not nearly as good as S1 and 2. All the 5 stars? Sure maybe you enjoyed it, but it's not well written or edited, especially compared to the first two seasons. It doesn't even pick up where S2 left off, but instead jumps ahead a couple years, so the ride to go get Aramis that ended S2? Yeah, pretend it never happened.

On top of it, the villains are just terrible. Rupert Everett's character just sort of shows up from out of nowhere and suddenly has the ear of the King. Sure. He is great compared to McNulty though. his character is a joke. He's the toughest guy ever, never gets caught, seemingly teleports all over Paris and just sort of has an unlimited supply of gold and henchmen. Seriously, he's such a totally silly badass, he should have been made the King. On top of it, they just forget or make stuff up  in contradiction of the first 2 seasons. Louis has an exiled brother? When did this happen? His only brother died in S1, you know, when his exiled mom tried to get her grandson made King. then the entire refugee scenario....sigh. So, where were all these refugees from? The Spanish/French border? How did they end up all the way across France and in Paris? Just absolutely silly and made the show much less entertaining than the first two seasons. I would recommend buying the first two seasons....and then peacefully ignoring this third one.",1490140800,,1438,4.484732824427481
7670069,5,B01BX2B1WY,"What a great show, I bought all 3 season and sat and watched them, they were so good I can't believe I missed this when it was on TV, its so great and so full of action and love and everything you could ever want... ITS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!",1490054400,,240,4.020833333333333

7670081,5,B01BX2B1WY,"The best show on tv! This season was very different than seasons 1 and 4, with a lot more badguys and shocking events.

The bad guy in this series are well done. You won't be disappointed! All 3 seasons are fantastic and well worth watching. My only advice is to watch them in order because what happens in one show is carried over into the next. The entire series has well developed story threads that leave you wanting more and more. In my opinion, this is on the THE best series out there.",1482451200,7,539,4.510204081632653

7670101,5,B01BX2B1WY,"Perhaps one of the best endings to a series in a long, long time, the third season follows the Musketeers as they return from four years at war, battling on the front lines with Spain. The writing did an amazing treatment of how this affected each character, especially D'artagnan. Becoming sarcastic and slightly cynical after he returns home to a France that was not as peaceful as he left it, he finds strength in the stability of his personal life, but finds little peace. Battling yet another king's advisor and his minions, they must risk everything that have and everyone they love to save France from falling into complete ruin.

Some of the best quotes and monologues are found in the third season. My favorite was D'artagnan's ""I refuse to die"" monologue. This is definitely one of the best series I've seen in a long time. I'm glad they seemed to be able to end it exactly the way they wanted to.",1482278400,,907,4.598765432098766

7670103,5,B01BX2B1WY,"This third, and unfortunately final, season of The Musketeers keeps up the spirit and excitement generated by the first two seasons.  The acting is fresh and enthusiastic, the scenes are beautifully shot and the bluray treatment is movie quality.

7670123,4,B01BX2B1WY,"Much like the previous seasons, well done.  Knowing this was final season, you wonder how it will conclude.  Although several characters are killed off, the series has a ""happy "" ending.",1480636800,,186,4.967741935483871

7670127,3,B01BX2B1WY,"The previous two seasons had some really amazing storytelling to them.  I don't know who was in charge of cutting scenes and writing some of the episodes in this final season, but it just was not up to par with the previous two seasons.  About half the episodes here are as good as the previous seasons, but the other half are just choppy and don't feel right.  The main villain getting away in almost every episode is unrealistic.  He kind of reminds me of that 90's toy ""Stretch Armstrong,"" no matter how many times you poke him with a sword, it doesn't seem to affect him, I don't know how he has all that stamina to keep escaping.  There are also some scenes that seem unneeded and kind of makes the viewer go ""what the heck was that about.""  I don't think it's any fault of the actors for these bad episodes, I think it's pretty much the fault of whoever was in charge of putting scenes together.  It just didn't flow smoothly.  It just wasn't right.  It was rushed.  A spectacular show like this deserved 100% attention from the people working on it and if they couldn't do the job correctly then the producers needed to find people who would.

The storyline for Athos was super dark this season, opposite from previous seasons.  Not too big of a fan on this part either, especially since the Musketeers should really be a lighthearted show as evidenced from the previous two seasons.  Porthos stayed true to character and ended well.  Dartanaman and Aramis also wrapped up well.

Overall the feel just wasn't there for this season, it didn't really feel like ""all for one and one for all,""  Bad job on some of the writers and editors again.  I will say that I appreciated the ending of the series, it did end well at least.  And the half of the episodes that were good were also enjoyable like the previous season.  I don't really know what else to say, I just didn't feel that the heart was there this time around...",1479427200,6,1924,4.445714285714286

7670129,5,B01BX2B1WY,"The final season expands into the next chapter of the Musketeers.  The first 2 seasons told the story we all know, this one goes beyond.  What do the Musketeers do when their jobs are basically finished?  How do they live their lives when Louie dies?  While there are some discrepancies from Season 1 I forgive them because it makes for better story telling.",1479254400,,358,4.634920634920635

7670145,4,B01BX2B1WY,The final season of the Musketeers was not quite what I expected. The story line was fair and the acting was sometimes very good and then sometimes only fair. The settings were very good and action scenes did have a lot to enjoy. The use of early firearms did lend an interesting way fighting was down in this period of history. I did enjoy the season enough to say it is worth watching.,1478304000,2,387,4.315068493150685

7670163,4,B01BX2B1WY,"This season isn't complete episodes. They are still in one hour segments, but it's like one movie with a plot to overthrow the king. This makes it feel longer. No binge watching here.

There are a LOT of new characters. The d'Artagnan/Constance relationship is now a bit flat. Athos and Sylvie have little chemistry. Aramis is no longer a womanizer, so we can't get to see Santiago Caberra in his sexy glory. The new villains are nasty, but not all that interesting.

This season just didn't capture my interest the way season 2 did. I wanted to like it more. It's still enjoyable, just not as juicy as season 2. It feels like the writers just ran out of gas. Even the actors are not as ""ooh rah"" as they were before.",1477180800,4,717,4.424242424242424
