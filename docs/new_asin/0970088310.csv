8310833,4,0970088310,I enjoyed the video and it has helped me with my 4 yo walker to the extent of training a young horse to gait.  It helped me realize I was requiring him to be collect prior to him gaiting well in a loose rein.  It helped me figure out what I was doing wrong by requiring him to collect and gait before he was ready.  I wish the video would have been more instructional such as giving close up shots of the exact bits they were using. I also think I would have gotten more out of the video if I had watched Part I because they made reference to certain parts of that video which then lost me.  I would definetly recommend this video for walker owners who are having pacey horses or need tips to get your horse to become more supple.,975196800,8,730,4.048611111111111
