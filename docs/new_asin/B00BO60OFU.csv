8571842,5,B00BO60OFU,"A sumptuously photographed slice of life drama about a man and his ten year old son coming to terms with a change in their circumstances. The scenery is both stunning and stark in turns. The writing is spot on; it is astutely observed and achingly accurate. And above all, the acting is first rate. It is so natural that you forget that they are actors. Beauty and heartache abound here, and you will love Jojo, and, at times, hate his father Ronald. And you will wonder why Jojo tries so hard to reach his father. And you will wonder where the mother is in all of this. But throughout, your perceptions will be constantly contradicted. And yet the ending is perfect.",1451692800,,667,4.520661157024794

8571844,5,B00BO60OFU,Poignant relationship movie.....I loved it.  I ended up buying a blue ray player just to see it.,1411257600,,96,4.647058823529412
8571845,4,B00BO60OFU,"""Kauwboy"" is, like ""Tomboy"" and ""The Boy with a Bike"", a film that catches you by surprise for its simplicity. ""Kauwboy"" is the story of Jojo, a boy who lives alone with his dad and a bird that steals the spot light and stir emotions like I have never seen before. This is how I like films: simple, moving and original.",1373241600,,319,4.245901639344262
8571846,5,B00BO60OFU,"This film from the Netherlands was submitted for Oscar foreign film submission.  It's the story of a boy from a troubled family who overcomes much of his angst after he befriends a bird.  If this sounds like your typical child/animal relationship movie, think again. You'll be slack-jawed throughout - not only for its poignancy but for its astounding special effects.",1365292800,,368,5.116666666666666
