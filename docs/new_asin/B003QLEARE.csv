4170143,4,B003QLEARE,It's a pretty hard dance steps really need to catch the step guide. It's was pretty fun workout! Jennifer is a great instructor.,1286928000,7,128,4.608695652173913
4170144,5,B003QLEARE,"I'm a big fan of Jeniffer Galardi and has all her DVD.
She's a great instructor and whatever she does, it looks great and fun.
This DVD is the most fun of all.
This program is for intermediate-advance cardio but really works on your legs and abs.
You might find it difficult but after couple of sessions you should be able to keep up.
Step guide helps, too.",1284940800,19,357,4.264705882352941
4170145,4,B003QLEARE,"This dance workout consists of 3 routines.  Per routine, each move is repeated a few times and then added to another. After about every couple of move combinations you learn, you ""dance it out"" from the top.  This process is repeated until you've learned all the moves then you do a final ""dance it out"" from the top with all the moves that make up that routine.  (Make sense??)

You will need some space as there are a few moves that require you to slide from side to side or back to front.  Lots of the moves are ""bouncy"" and/or require some seriously fast footwork (beware the ""Work It Out"" routine) so fortunately, for the rhythmally (??) challenged, there is a 20 minute step guide that breakdown some of the dance moves you'll see in the workout.  The actual workout itself is about 45 minutes.

Some dance moves I'll try to describe.  Others, you'll just have to see:

Warm-up:  Hip hop march, step touch, grapevine with hip pumps, double pumps, and chest and hip isolations

Hit 'Em Hard (Routine 1):  Scuff (like you're scuffing the bottom of your foot against the floor), quick cross, strut, the throw (a sliding move with your arms moving like your putting on a jacket), chest pops, sway, rock it hips, uppercuts

Work It Out (Routine 2):  Stomp & Throw, punch & pull, dirt off the shoulder (single, single, double bounces with brushing off your shoulder) side hitch kick, booty bump, knee knock, dig sweep, laso (knocking knees together with arms like your about the throw a laso), dirt off the heel (similar to the scuff)

Smooth It Out (Routine 3--Much slower tempo, more toning than cardio):  Heel combo (lifting heels with pelvic thrusts), slide catch, snake, groove, crunch twists, ""locomotion"", leg pumps (a stomping transition move)

Cool down:  Hip rolls and various stretches

Purely as a cardio workout, I'd give this one 3 1/2 stars, if it were possible.  I found that I REALLY had to exaggerate the moves in order to get my heart rate up (fyi: I'm about an intermediate level).  On the flip side, though, my obliques were screaming, which is what it's supposed to do considering this is an ab focused workout, so that kind of made up for it.  The moves are very cute--a few are kind of reminiscent of Galardi's All Star Workouts Dance Party (knee knock, double pump, the throw) which is my favorite routine of hers so that was pretty cool to see.  She also gives good instruction and cues pretty well.  Since there were more positives about this workout, I'm rounding it up to four stars.

For those wanting a comparison of this and Jen's other DOTI workout, Hip Hop Party, this one has hip hop moves in all three routines while the other only really has one.  The choreography of this workout is a bit more trickier that Hip Hop Party but I personally feel that Hip Hop Party delivers a better cardio work out.",1284854400,72,2835,4.608782435129741

4170157,1,B003QLEARE,It was a miserable experience.  I can do aerobics and I even taught for 6 years but I couldn't do this.  I also felt it wasn't particularly good for the knees the way it was taught.,1430956800,,181,4.0

4170159,3,B003QLEARE,"I really like Jennifer.  The tutorial is very helpful.  The 3 stars are because she switches from one dance move to another so fast, before you get one move down, she's moving on to the next, combining them all together leaving you confused.  I am hoping that the more I do the video that I will pick it up.  If not, well, it will be up for sale again :).",1428624000,,355,4.0285714285714285

4170162,5,B003QLEARE,I have many of Jennifer Galardi's dance work outs.  This one is my favorite.  It does take a few times to get the steps down.  The first move in work out number one is the hardest of the whole DVD.  It's a great way to get in some cardio and there's a lot of ab work too.  I would definitely recommend this DVD,1423094400,2,310,3.857142857142857

4170164,4,B003QLEARE,"Work out dance routines are nice to behold but most are too cumbersome to perform. Need to know how to do some of them before you can catch up. Lessons on how to dance each steps ought to have come before the workout proper not the other way round. Great for trying to loose some kg if you can keep up.
Also, sound quality was too poor, looks like this video was done by an amateur.",1414540800,,382,4.0394736842105265

4170179,4,B003QLEARE,Jennifer Galardi does hip hop dance moves to create a fun workout through dancing seen on music videos and it is a great way to learn modern dance and be the next dancing star on the floor at the night clubs.  Great for people who can't do strenuous exercise and would like to start out exercising through dance.  It's a good fun workout.,1405123200,,338,4.349206349206349

4170182,1,B003QLEARE,"It is mainly just a somewhat slow hip hop dance lesson step by step.. it never really just picks up and does a cardio to keep up with.

4170183,4,B003QLEARE,"I'm a long time Step Aerobics gal. It seems like overnight those classes fell off the schedule at my gym, all replaced by Latin Dance, Body Jam, or Zumba.  Many of the classes are huge, the instructors don't explain the moves very well and sometimes it's hard to see the instruction who is moving pretty quickly. I went looking for a DVD with more instruction.  I ordered this one because it had short segments, was inexpensive and advertised a learn-the-moves section.

I think it's pretty good. I already get a lot of the foot moves, they're old aerobic/dance combinations re-packaged, but the hip rotating is new for me.  She does a good job of explaining about the hip and ab moves and how to maximize their effects. I imagine there are better DVDs for people who're familiar with the moves but for someone who wants a breakout of common moves I think this is helpful.",1387065600,2,872,4.606451612903226
4170184,2,B003QLEARE,I am a big jennifer galardi fan but this one doesnt do it for me.  Im prefer the more aerobic dance than this video  im not trying to be a backup in a jlo video the bouncing around is hard on my knees and girls upstairs if you kmow what I mean,1382918400,,243,3.6538461538461537

Probably the most challenging of her workouts I think but boy is it fun and good.  She says ""you don't have to look like them to do it"" and shes right because i sure didn't but you do her workouts 5-6 days a week and it won't be long before you do.  Please put it online!  Make another one please!",1379721600,2,426,3.784090909090909
4170186,4,B003QLEARE,"Definitely works you out. Instruction is slow enough to follow for the most part. Would definitely recommend it to someone like me that isn't in shape and needing something easier to start out with (wish I would have kept it up though, unfortunately, it doesn't fix laziness and lack of will power)",1378425600,,298,4.75
4170187,5,B003QLEARE,I am sweating after 10 min into this DVD. A good cardio workout for people who like dance instead of going to the gym,1377648000,,117,3.9166666666666665
4170188,3,B003QLEARE,"This is a perfectly fine routine.  It will get your blood pumping and your brow sweating.
But you better be kinda' good at dancing.  I have always been something of a klutz when it comes to dancing, a problem which makes this workout frustrating for me.  Even after repeatedly watching the introduction where she slowly teaches you all of the steps and practicing along with her, I'm unable to do them.  I feel like an idiot flailing about.  Which, ultimately, doesn't do much to motivate me to do the workout.  I'll keep plugging away because I spent the money on the DVD, but I don't think this is one that I'll be doing for very long.  Simply put, it's hard for a non-dancer.
If you have a dance background or have done a lot of dance workout routines, then maybe you'll have no problems with it.  But as a person who sucks at dancing and was looking for a fun way to do a cardio workout at home, I don't feel this really works for me.",1377648000,,938,4.2897727272727275
4170189,5,B003QLEARE,Love the dvd. I am on a workout kick and love dancing for my health. The songs are great and I love to dance to them.,1373068800,,117,3.5384615384615383
4170190,2,B003QLEARE,"Really sort of hard moves.  Too hard for me and I took dance when I was young and taught aerobics for close to 25 years.  I could not get all the moves.  If you are a hip hop dancer it will be easy, if you are not, it may be too difficult to get a good workout.",1372291200,,261,3.543859649122807
4170191,5,B003QLEARE,I had this workout DVD once  before and it had gotten scratched and couldn't play.  I really enjoy the dance routines and the workout does fl by because it is so fun.,1371427200,,166,4.15625
4170192,4,B003QLEARE,"The moves in this video have the right amount of difficulty to keep up the replay value. Its a hit and miss for the dance moves. Some I really like- the body rolls, slides, knee knock. Others I don't- like the march in the warm up, the last half of the second workout which isn't very smooth working one move into another.

I do like the video overall- the moves I enjoy out weight the others. This video is just missing some of the classic Jennifer Galardi moves- the hip roll circles, box step ect.

Of all the Dancing Off the Inches Dvds Jennifer does, this is the only one that had 'Cardio' in the title, yet it works up the least amount of sweat.",1365724800,,651,4.2
4170193,5,B003QLEARE,I was very happy with DVD that I purchased. I even received the DVD sooner than I had expected. Would reccommend,1363564800,,112,4.380952380952381
4170194,5,B003QLEARE,"This was a fun workout that got my heartrate up, and contained enough variety to keep me interested for many workouts.  The steps only took a couple of times to learn, yet will probably take weeks to really master.  The music was pleasant and the instructor is fabulous.  This is probably the best, most enthusiastic instructor I've experienced on a DVD.  She seems genuine, and her timing and cues are spot on.",1361923200,,411,4.666666666666667
4170195,5,B003QLEARE,I wanted a different and interesting yet challenging workout. I did the step by step for each dance move and I was sweating with that alone. The dance moves are fun. Jennifer does not talk too much on the dvd and the music sounds great. I may consider purchasing more of her dvds.,1359158400,,280,4.30188679245283
4170206,5,B003QLEARE,"This DVD can be pretty overwhelming, so if you have never danced before, make sure you love being pushed and overwhelmed or get something easier.  I have never done hip hop before, but she goes through all the harder excercises in a side clip.  When you get to the actual workouts, it just gets harder, but if you stick with it, things eventually start clicking together, and you have the hope that eventually you will look like you are actually dancing instead of making weird moves.  DON'T GIVE UP though!  LOL.  Because it is hard if you have never danced before.  I went through the practice moves 3-4 times before I even started the actual workout, and after that I only did sections of the workout to get the hang of it.  But it is fun and the teacher is upbeat and explains things pretty well.  It's also good if you don't want to be bored later on when you have the moves down.",1358553600,,885,4.353658536585366
4170207,5,B003QLEARE,Great buy. Definitely recommended for those who want to get in shape and love to dance. DVD is filled with lots of sweat dropping moves!,1358380800,,136,4.48
4170208,3,B003QLEARE,"I don't know why I have so much trouble with the moves in this video.  They seem so simple in the step guide, and Galardi introduces each move slowly, but still when she puts it all together, I have trouble keeping up.  Maybe it's just me.  Probably.  I do like that it gets me feeling good about my body.  I'm not into hip hop really, but the moves kind of make me feel sexy.",1358294400,,376,4.027027027027027
4170209,5,B003QLEARE,"Every time I buy a new dance work out DVD from Jennifer Galardi, it becomes my new favorite. Therefore, this is my new favorite!  There are three dance routines, a warm up and a cool down.  There is also a section in which she goes over the more difficult dance moves, and I recommend watching this before you begin the actual routine.

The thing I really love is that even though I've been doing this routine for months, it is still fun and a great deal of exercise!  As you progress, you can drop lower, jump higher, etc.  You can always do more, and therefore always get results.

I own quite a few of Jennifer's DVDs and I love them all.  She is very personable and motivating.  Also, there is no floor work involved with her dance DVDs; all routines are performed in the standing position which I prefer.",1357689600,,809,4.382550335570469
4170210,1,B003QLEARE,"The DVD was fine, but it didn't do anything to help make exercise more ""fun."" A lot of the moves were ok when taken slowly but at regular pace.. it was dreadful.",1357171200,,161,4.0625
4170211,1,B003QLEARE,"Frankly, I hate this video and would never had ordered it had it not said ""dance"".  It's not a ""dance"" video, the music is boring and the exercise doesn't resemble dance at all (I didn't look at the entire DVD).  I got smart and went to the library and checked out some DVDs to try before I buy anymore.  I also bought Jennifer Garaldi's Hip Hop Party (also says ""dance"" on it).  I'm keeping it but couldn't say it was a favorite either.",1354406400,2,437,4.228915662650603

4170213,4,B003QLEARE,"If you really want to sweat it out, this is the DVD you should purchase.  You may need some times to get use the the steps but should not be a big problem as i dont' have any background on hip hop but i can follow most of them",1349654400,,226,3.6122448979591835
4170214,5,B003QLEARE,"Hey - I am 60 years old and - thanks to Jennifer Galardi, (and watching my intake of sweets and fats) my body looks like I'm 30!  This dance workout dvd is quick, comprehensive and easy to learn - you can just work on one section at a time to start then build as you start to memorize the routines.  It is dance - not aerobics and it tightens EVERYTHING.  I now have great oblique and ab muscles and my legs look sculpted - and let's not even talk about what it does for the behind! lol

I started doing alternate workouts with this dvd and Jen's Latin Rhythms one before vacation. It only takes about 40 minutes and wow - is it worth it!  Guess who looked absolutely fabulous in a bathing suit at the pool?

Jen and her posse of 2 sweet little girl backup dancers - Heather and Tiffany, demonstrate all the moves - I keep up as best I can and some moves I eliminate if they make my bothersome knee turn funny (I just keep doing the previous move).  Try it just once or twice a week and you will see results within the month - your whole body responds to this and after each workout you will have energy to spare!  If I had time, I would do it EVERY day!

Best of all, I use it to loosen up when I have to do stuff around the house that requires a lot of physical effort - it warms up my arms, back and legs so that I can spend the day painting or gardening or whatever.

This is good stuff, people - But like everything in life, you have to work at it.  Best thing about it is that you do not have to travel anywhere, deal with any people in a class and you can do all the work out moves (including bumping your booty), in the privacy of your own home!",1347840000,,1653,3.978787878787879
4170215,3,B003QLEARE,"I bought this because I thought dancing would be a fun workout since aerobics bore me and the product touted that ANYONE can do this. But after trying it out and attempting to learn the moves, I think that it's very hard to follow and not at all easy to learn. I felt like a spastic nerd most of the time and I just gave up after awhile and did my own lame swaying back and forth 'dance' just to keep going because I was totally lost. Maybe this video is great for people with a dance background or people who are very fit already, but it's definitely not for beginners. But I gave it 3 stars because it does look fun and I liked the instructor, but I just wanted to warn others that this is definitely not a workout ANYONE can do and shouldn't really be attempted if you're not already in pretty good shape.",1343088000,,808,4.1528662420382165

4170218,2,B003QLEARE,"I bought this after I had my daughter, since I did not have time to go to the gym. I thought I could tone up and learn some fun dance moves. The first thing I will say is this is very fast paced, even the teaching section is fast paced. In my opinion many of the dance moves are very complex, at least for a person that only has one year of dance experience in hip hop and jazz. Another thing I did not like about this video is that the music is very bland and repetitive, like something you would hear in an old school 70's work out video, it is not modern and fun to dance too. If you are looking to a fun work out video, with music that makes you want to work out, and easy moves to learn, this is NOT the video for you and if you have no dance experience this also is NOT the video for you.",1336608000,,794,3.8181818181818183

My daughter still gives up part way through because it's just too tough for her to get all the steps down, but I still do my best and can at least get through most of it (with some moves that I skip). About 3/4 of the way through, I always quit because it's just too difficult to learn. I'm hoping I will be able to get the whole thing down eventually because it really is a fun video.  I would recommend this to someone who is already a hip-hop dancer, but if you aren't, it is going to be challenging for you and may not be worth buying.",1333324800,,718,3.9722222222222223

Great price too.",1330732800,,290,3.3333333333333335
4170223,5,B003QLEARE,"I bought this DVD along with two others after Christmas with a gift card I received.  I love dancing (Tap, Jazz, Ballet, Hip-Hop...) and I've bought a previous DVD from this instructor before (Crunch: Fat Burning Dance Party) and really liked her style and energy in the workouts.  Since I have had years of dance training and have been doing aerobic exercise routines since Jane Fonda, I didn't even go over to the step-by-step guide that they offer and instead jumped right in to the routine.  I'm going to guess though that many people won't be able to do this and should definitely view the step-by-step guide first.  Also, since I have an older DVD from Jennifer Galardi, I'm also used to the type of choreography that she teaches.  I think this workout is a lot of fun, but it is also very tough because I find myself pretty tired when it's finally done.  I suppose some of the moves could be tough for those that have sensitive joints since you do bounce around a lot.  I recommend this video for anyone that wants to workout, but wants to feel like they aren't working out; I'm definitely not the type that can go to the gym for a couple hours because I find it too boring.

4170224,5,B003QLEARE,"I've purchased a Jennifer Galardi hip hop dance dvd before and had hesitations about buying this one because I figured it would be a lot of the same dances.  I was wrong! I've been a dancer my whole life (never a hip hop class though) yet I found this DVD to be a decent level of challenging.  The dances are also fun, some dance DVDs drag on because  they keep going through the step over and over again, but this one didn't stay on one step for too long.  It kept me interested, all 3 dances worked up a sweat, it is fairly short but all the cardio you'll need for a day. I watched the step guide before starting, which I'd definiteley suggest as some of the more complicated steps are broken down  nicely here and Jennifer doesn't  waste time doing that during the  dances. She says to wear supportive shoes but I found this easier with shoes  off - personal preference  though. I would definitely recommend this DVD if you're looking for dance cardio!",1328745600,2,955,4.380681818181818
4170225,3,B003QLEARE,"It seems like this workout would be a lot of fun, but I've already given up on it because the moves are just too difficult to follow, and fast-paced at that. I'd be apt to blame it on my being 47, but when my daughter (who's 24) found out I'd purchased this DVD, she told me she'd have given me hers, for the same reason - it's just too difficult to follow, even for someone who has some (recent) dance experience. Now I guess it could just be that she inherited my I'm-confused-and-uncoordinated genes...it's possible, right? I should also mention that some of the moves are hard on the knees (for those of you with elevated rheumatoid factors like me). Again, it looks like a lot of fun, but I think I'd need to practice one move a day (perhaps one a WEEK?), over and over again (modifying the moves that are hard on the knees, of course), and then maybe once I got each move down, TRY to put them all together in this workout. No promises there though, I'm THAT discouraged.",1327881600,,977,4.344262295081967
4170246,4,B003QLEARE,"I've enjoyed working out to some of the Shaun T Hip Hop Abs (HHA) DVDs, but I thought I would explore others for some variety.  Unlike other forms of dance, which often require moving in very specific ways, hip hop allows you to move more naturally and in your own style (so if you are a clutz, it's a good intro to dance).

After reading up on several sold on Amazon, I started with this one, because Jennifer Galardi videos get very positive reviews, and another website selling dance videos rated this for beginners/intermediate.  Like early HHA (but not like the dance party ones), the dancers are in what appears to be a small dance class studio with no audience. Though a beginner in decent shape with a good feel for dancing can handle this video, I would not consider this a beginner dance video as much as an intermediate one.  It's structured a little differently from HHA, in that Shaun T teaches each move from slow to tempo speeds, and each move at tempo is repeated multiple times, with a brief rest before going into the next. It's only later, after the user has repeated the individual moves multiple times and had a chance to ""master"" them to some degree that he strings a few of them together into a short routine. In the main dancing routine of this disk, which consists of several combinations of moves she teaches in a separate Step Guide, Jennifer and her two other dancers go through all the moves only at tempo with no rest between, assuming you've learned them in the instruction portion.

The individual steps in this video are not particularly difficult, though some are slightly more complicated than the moves in early HHA videos, and it does take more practice for an untrained dancer to master them.  Some are medium-impact, so warm up even before starting the instructional Step Guide to avoid injuries. One feature HHA videos have that this doesn't is optional no-impact versions of all the moves.  However, you can modify the ones in Jennifer's video on your own to avoid too much impact.  Some of the moves require more twisting, sometimes quickly, than the HHA moves do. As I have a bad disk in my lower back, I have to shorten the moves and reduce the twisting to avoid aggrevating it too much.  This may become less of a problem as my core becomes stronger.

In the Step Guide, Jennifer does an excellent job of breaking down each move into components, then putting them together slowly to help you to understand how to do them.  However, she does each only four times at tempo speed.  That's not enough time for a beginner to get a good feel for the move. It would be helpful if she would repeat the individual moves many times, so the user can learn to do them smoothly and without thinking about them too much while doing them in the dance routine. That's how HHA does it.  You can stop the video and back it up to the beginning of the move's tempo speed to try it again, but that is not convenient. Otherwise, you can just go on to the dance routine, jumping into the pool's deep end, and just hope it'll get easier over time.

Once you get the moves down, it's a good aerobic workout, and you really feel like you are dancing. There are some sexy hip gyrating moves, as there are in the HHA Hips, Buns and Thighs. The HHA HB&T video is a good intro to this disk, in that there are both simpler and similar moves, and I find HB&T to be an easier workout.  In fact, I have been doing some of the HB&T workout as a warm-up to Jennifer's video. A more advanced user may not care to do that.  I haven't had Jennifer's video for very long, and haven't yet made it all the way through without stopping, but it seems very compatible with what I'd been doing with HHA, just at a more advanced level.

2013 update: I've been working out to this disk for several months, though not too many times per week. By sticking with it, I am now very comfortable with the moves and routines. I still modify some of the twisting and high-impact moves so as not to hurt my lower back, and I get all the way through the disk pretty easily. I've even extended my workout by following it with HHA HB&T, to make it a full hour of exercise. I like that Galardi's feels more like dance than the HHA videos, especially with moves like the ""Snake"".",1327190400,,4261,4.428388746803069

4170248,3,B003QLEARE,"This appears to be a good workout video. However, the costumes were very distracting. I rather see that my instructor is in shape, in regular aerobic clothes rather than ""hip hop"" gear. It was very unrealistic. The dance moves are good but the instructor also goes very fast so it is difficult to keep up with. I considered returning this (or exchanging it for the amazon gift card) because I rather devote my extra time to exercise, rather than learning a complicated routine (often found myself pressing rewind) but I decided to keep the video to mix my routine up a bit. Bottom line, if you want a real workout video - circuit training is the way to go. This is fun if you want to mix it every now and again.",1326240000,,711,4.393939393939394

4170250,5,B003QLEARE,"Dancing is the best way to alleviate stress. Jennifer has super fun routines that build off of very simple steps. The more you learn them, the more of your own style can be added in. Within a few times of doing the videos, you don't have to think about the steps, you're just dancing and it is really fun.

I really like that DOTI includes a step guide, giving you a chance to get the more intricate moves down before you workout. This really allows you to focus on your cardio instead of your footwork. But of course, instruction from Jennifer is always fabulous, and she breaks down moves for you without ever sacrificing your cardio, which is why I love working out with her.

Really fun routines, can't wait to try Jenn's other Dance of the Inches DVD.",1305676800,3,576,4.693069306930693

I have done aerobics classes, Wii workouts, Wii dance, etc.  It is very quick paced and when she puts all the moves together, its difficult to keep up and follow, never having done those moves before.  There is a training session before the actual workout to show you how to do the moves, but I think it will just take doing the video many times to learn the moves.  It is a good workout, you definately sweat.  I gave it three stars for workout and fun factor!  You won't get bored doing this routine.",1305590400,10,586,4.281818181818182
4170257,5,B003QLEARE,"DVD workouts are my mainstay and I have many of them.  This one compares very favorably with the rest (in my top 3).  Jennifer Gallardi is generally an excellent instructor and if you like her style you will not be disappointed with Cardio Hip Hop.  As any workout DVD should be, it's physically challenging, has smooth choreography and is well thought out.  Jennifer Galardi provides just the right amount of input.  She always gives cues ahead of the move, reminds you to use proper form, and is good natured and encouraging without being over-the-top cute.  This DVD rises above many others because it holds your interest and makes you want to do it again.  Why?  It's the ""COOL"" factor.  I'd personally rather be hip-hop dancing in my living room than doing another aerobic workout.  It feels more like a party and less like a chore.  You'll do some novel steps you've probably never done in any other workout, the music has some depth and interest to it and the dancers are good at conveying an informal, fun party mood.  BTW, I think her dance workouts are fairly comprehensive but they are only about 1/2 hour and should probably be supplemented by a brief strength training session.",1303430400,16,1190,4.723300970873787
4170258,4,B003QLEARE,"This is a GREAT workout.  It WILL get your heart rate up and move it, move it.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is that you definitely must check out the section that shows you the moves from start to finish.  There is no ""faking"" it when you watch the routines because it is fast paced.  Other than that, this is a great workout, the music isn't horrible, the sound recording is good and the characters aren't completely annoying.",1301702400,,428,4.3125

It was like taking a dance class again! I do this workout at least once a week and just have fun while I get my heart rate up.",1301184000,3,475,3.9072164948453607

When I followed the exercise (dance) 15 minutes, my whole body warm up and in the 25 minutes, I feel my heart is pumping and at the end, I feel my whole body is sweating, which I don't see very often. Jennifer designs the dance so that you don't feel bored or feel hard. I have been doing the dancing for a coupe of months since cold winter. I do the dancing at night. Since then, I went to bed with a warm body and had a good sleep. The video was designed to loose inches. I would strongly recommend this video to those who has cold fingers. It has been (still going) a wonderful experience. You should try it.",1300579200,,687,4.134328358208955
4170261,5,B003QLEARE,"Jennifer Galardi, the instructor of this DVD, has always been a favorite of mine, but I have never really tried out the Dance Off the Inches series.  So, b/c of Jennifer I gave this DVD a go and really enjoyed it!  It's great for me, an advanced exerciser, but it's also awesome for a beginner, because there is a separate section designed to break down the complicated moves that will let you learn the moves but not let your heart rate get down in the cardio routine.  Jennifer is a fun instructor that is genuine and not fake.  She is having a good time with you while making sure to teach you the moves and show you the proper technique.

There are several sections to talk about on this DVD.  First of all is the breakdown step guide which teaches about 1/3 of the moves you will learn.  Jennifer shows you the move quickly before breaking it down and explaining it to you half time (with no music in the background, by the way).  First she shows the feet, then the arms.  Finally, she will take it up to tempo with you.  Then you have the warm up which is simple and effective.  You do about 4 simple dance moves such as marches and grapevines before doing some chest and hip isolations, which Jennifer teaches well.  The first combo starts off with a few tricky steps, but it finishes off with some simple moves.  The emphasis is really hitting the moves hard so there is a little bit of popping and jumping.  Your heart rate will definitely rise with this section.  The second routine is VERY high cardio and it pretty fast.  It has some rhythms changes that might be a bit tricky but there's a lot of repetition to make sure you get them down; it also has some straightforward moves that everyone should get and have fun with.  The third and final routine is much slower and easier and it has, as Jennifer says, an ""R&B feel"" to it.  Even though all the routines emphasize abs, this one really focuses on them and works them hard.  You finish with a cool down that really stretches out your whole body and feels amazing, bringing an end to your workout!

As a final note, I will say that each time I do this workout, my arms and shoulders are sore the next day, and the first few times I did the DVD, my abs were sore, as well, so it is pretty effective in toning in addition to the cardio benefits.  I really recommend this DVD to everyone: beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercisers/dancers.  I think it has something for everyone and is fun to do.  The cues are well done for the most part, and it's an effective cardio workout, making it a top workout DVD, in my opinion.",1297296000,3,2589,4.359081419624217
4170262,4,B003QLEARE,"I have the Hip Hop Cardio Party too - and was easy enough choreography to not watch the tutorial and just jump right in without any issues.  This workout is a little more tricky and the transitions are faster paced.  Still fun, but I need to work at this one a little.  The music isn't great - but the moves are fun and it's a nice change from traditional cardio workouts.

Short enough that I can fit in an ab or weight workout afterwards.

If you are looking for a high intensity workout, you might not enjoy this. However, once you know it, you can just increase your intensity and really get into it.

I really enjoyed the Dance off the Inches Bellydance (Bollywood) workout too!",1297209600,,683,4.380952380952381

I could catch on after a bit but next time I work out with the dvd I will use the guide.  I also noticed that Jennifer kept referencing the guide during the routines.  I really enjoy Jennifer's dvds. I have a Crunch and Prevention video by Jennifer as well.  She uses some of the same moves through out her dvds and throws in some additional ones two. Hey, the body can only move so much!

with rhythm and dance sense only.  Fast paced and easy to get lost and give up if you don't know much about
