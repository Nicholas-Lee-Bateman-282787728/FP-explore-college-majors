3819201,2,B001V7UX4E,"I have only watched the 1st episode from this season and I felt compelled to write a review. I can't watch another at this point. I don't think this guy has a sponser or is even working a 12 step program at all. This is not what recovery is really like. The 12 step program I'm in and all the ones that I know of are based on attraction not promotion. Also professional interventions are not like this at all. I mean it's one thing when a family and friends have an intervention to let the addict know that they care for them and if they do not accept recovery that they will not enable them to use anymore thus letting the addict hit rock bottom. When Family and friends stop helping the addict to be helpless, it can have a profound effect on the addict. It is important for the addict to accept recovery on their own. The first step is that we admitted that we were powerless over our addiction and that our lives had become unmanagable. No one could convince us that we were addicts. It's an admission that we must make for ourselves, not the judge or probation officer, ect. This guy is obviously working his own program which means that he does not think that he is powerless over his addiction. We can only carry the message of recovery and hope which is that an addict, any addict, can stop using drugs, lose the desire to use, and find a new way to live. We don't shove the message down anybodys throat. My programs Basic Text says that an addict that does not want to stop using will not stop using. They can be analyzed, counseled, reasoned with, prayed over, threatened, beaten, or locked up, but they will not stop until they have the desire to stop using.

  The 1st step for me means that I can not use successfully but it also means that I can not stay clean on my own. It's not just admitting that I have a problem but admitting that I have a problem that can not be solved by myself. I used to think that powerlessness meant helplessness but if anything I was helpless before I admitted I was powerless and after I did then I became helpable. Powerlessness means using drugs against our will.

  The Guy in the show also dosen't care if anyone gets hurt by his actions along the way. You can tell that he isn't working on his self by his behaviors and we have to lead by example.

  It isn't about what I did for my recovery 3 years ago that keeps me clean today; it's a daily surrender to my Higher Power to whom I choose to call God. If people are getting shot because of my behavior ; that's what I would call self-will not God's Will. From being clean for over 3 years while working a program; I have found that I only know one thing for certain of God's Will for me and that is to stay clean. In Order for me to stay clean clean I have to work my program; a part of my program is to carry a message of hope to the addict that still suffers. I do this in the meetings and with my program in what we call H & I work where we go into Hospitals and Institutions and carry the message to addicts that can't get out to a meeting on the account that they are in detox, treatment, or jail. Even in these cases, the addicts choose to come to the meetings.

  We do make 12 step calls but they are pretty rare these days on the account of the increasing amount of treatment centers there are around today. Back in the day it there wasn't a whole lot around accept for hospitals and I'v heard that a lot of addict just won't kick in the meeting which addicts still do today. I have never been on a 12 step call but I hear oldtimers talking about them and have heard some interesting stories about them. In the cases that I heard about there were addicts that were in recovery but then relapsed and called a member of the fellowship to take them to detox. They formed a group of recovering addicts that had all worked the 12 steps at least once to go and help them.

  The guy in the show says that he made a promise to God that if God got him clean that he would be His avenging angel. Just because God helped him get clean on the account of his surrender that day on the account that He is a loving caring God, doesn't mean that it's now God's Will for him to go around and forcing what he sees as God's Will on people. God's the one who gave us free will in the 1st place. And we have free will to surrender that will over to Him to care for us but that too is a decision that we have to make for ourselves. I believe that most of my problems are self inflicted. God still cared for me the whole time in my using days but I would not accept God's help. Those were the times that I would curse God because I still thought that I had power over my addiction and I thought that I knew what was best for me. When everything seemed to be falling apart all around me; everything was actually coming together. All I had to do was just let it. Today I living clean and am learning how to cope with life on life's terms with the help of a loving caring God of my understanding.",1249257600,5,4982,4.121649484536082
3819202,5,B001V7UX4E,"This is a great television series.  It is about a man named William who has spent many years as a drug addict.  As he's become clean and sober, he's made a promise to God to help others with their addictions.  Each episode is about an intervention he makes to help someone who has problems with alcohol, meth, cocaine, heroin, etc.

William has an interesting group of colleagues who assist him with these interventions.  They are also ex-addicts as he is.

The show also deals with William's family life, especially his troubled marriage and his relationship with his two children.

If you are at all interested in addiction and like to watch both drama and action, this is the show for you.",1247529600,19,692,4.669421487603306

3819212,3,B001V7UX4E,"One of the problems with this series is the misconception of blaming drugs for the moral shortcomings of people. Compromised behavior stands alone and when attached to one's habits still deserves to be on its own with the object of any obsession carrying no blame due to, for one, the false logic of any object, or objects, capable of morality, people have morality not ""things"". This approach in dated terms would have been called ""passing the buck"", the excuses for one's weakness does vary for each of us, true, however we will fare better, first, possibly recognizing the power anything can hold over us,
 along with realizing the responsibility, lies squarely on our own shoulders, to quote this cliche' reservedly.
The question is asked during one episode ""do you think this is fun?"" while a girl lay unconscious, obviously it is not only fun but quite entertaining hence the show.",1494460800,,887,4.913333333333333

3819214,3,B001V7UX4E,"This series is way more about this guy's family life and his outside relationships than it is about helping other people. There should at least be a title change to let people know this is not about a guardian angel, but more about an agnostic do-gooder who seems to help people. he has no idea about Scripture is like everyone who has no idea what God says IN Scripture. He expects God to say and do as William wishes. He cannot see the true light at the end of the tunnel because he is blinded by his own false illumination.

Jesus  said to his disciples, when He was asked if they should make the non believers stop their preaching the scripture for profit and personal gain, basically ""Let them be. As long as they are not against us they are for us."" They were doing Good Works, but they were doing it for personal benefit, not to the benefit of the Kingdom. William had a calling. he answered but he is not a true believer, If he was he would know God is using him but God is not allowing William to use God for his own self profit. (William's pride.) I have not looked ahead but if William does eventually see the light, the series will turn into another Stairway to Heaven, or some other miracle series.",1491177600,,1211,4.307017543859649

3819222,1,B001V7UX4E,I tried to watch the second episode but the characters talked so fast and there was so much background noise such as music or the ocean that I could not understand what was being said therefore could not follow the story.

3819225,5,B001V7UX4E,I was captivated by this show. Benjamin Bratt was believable and I enjoyed his dialogues with God. I also liked that they cast a range of people in the roles. I've watched both seasons and hope they bring it back.,1471651200,6,213,4.35
3819226,5,B001V7UX4E,"Liked this show from the beginning. It was very well acted, written and the story-lines were interesting and kept you glued to the screen. I own both seasons and was very disappointed that it did not do well for A&E. I think in television everyone has to be beautiful and perfect or willing to work toward those goals. In this show, William didn't always win and we were able to see how that pushed him toward the edge a lot of the time. His fellow recovering addicts were the same flawed people and that is what made this show very different from everything else on screen. No one likes to see the cracks. I applauded them and William & Co every week. Too bad they only got two seasons.",1469750400,,687,4.333333333333333

3819241,5,B001V7UX4E,"I was really touched. The character is real and he has faith. Faith that calls him to help those that others would just judge. I don't think this series would even be acceptable today. I really enjoy his ongoing talk with God which is real, not the kind of ""everything will be joyous"" after one accepts the existence of God. Great acting and great true stories. I'm going to watch it again because there are few realistic faith films and few faith films at all. There is a large audience for faith based films of quality and this series is of great quality especially for addicts and those associated with addicts. Also a great series for Christians who need a lesson in love.",1455840000,,676,4.504065040650406

Just started watching but I hope the cleanliness part doesn't change(update-it changed). This is one of the few original series if not the only one I can watch on amazon prime video.

3819249,4,B001V7UX4E,"Benjamin Bratt plays an addict to a tee.  My guess is that is why this series didn't last more than a season.  Granted the charcter is not using, but he hasn't done very much to work on his addict personality issues... He is what is known as a dry drunk.  He thinks he knows everything, but actually is clueless when it comes to his family and crew of fellow interveners.  And unlike the reviewer who thinks Bratt can't act, like I said, I think Bratt plays this really jacked up anti-hero quite well.  Which makes him REALLY unpleasant to watch.  In fact, pretty much everyone does a good job at playing really damaged people.  For me, the highlight was Eric Roberts as an ex-con trying to stay clean so he can have a relationship with his teenage son.  It's been a long time since I've seen him play anything other than a really bad person and this role gives him a chance to show off his acting ability.  Do watch the series, but be prepared to not like the characters and enjoy a group of actors exercising their craft.",1450569600,14,1023,4.37037037037037
3819250,5,B001V7UX4E,"There are plenty of examples that make it impossible to believe that anyone cares about quality in art, or art at all.  There are far too many commercialized, factory produced shlock-art products to ""prove"" that most people don't care.  But every now and again something comes along that reminds you that there are people who love art, and more importantly, respect it.  They show that love and respect by offering the world something true, beautiful, and simple.  It doesn't have to be pretty, clever, or even meaningful.  It just has to be done well and be true to itself. ""The Cleaner"" was just such a piece.  Take or leave it. Love it or hate it. This was art.  This is why an experiment of galloping horses gave us film as an art form.

Maybe it isn't so sad that there isn't more of it.  Then we might not appreciate it so much when we do find little jewels like this.",1450224000,6,874,4.4125

3819252,5,B001V7UX4E,"Real, eye-opening, emotional and down to earth, to-the-point, no sugar coating stories of the common drug abuse in our everyday communities, involving everyday joes who ""can't possibly think they have a problem or that they can hide it and it will go away"".

The heartache and challenges of the family are just as engaging as those of the 'clients' he is attempting to help. The main character's conflict of belief and commitment to a 'promise to god' made at an agonizing point in his life, is compelling. I was fully invested in the characters through every episode of Season 1 and I do want to know what happens in Season 2.  I am glad this popped up on my Prime recommendations.

3819555,5,B001V7UX4E,"It's based on a true story #1
What he does for addicts because he is an addict is great!
People have a problem of him taking the addicts against their will but if you know a true addict they will lie, steal, promise you the'll quit etc and there's only one direction they're headed because they can't stop, they need help, and they won't do it willingly.
Still watching 2nd season where even though he's changed if you're in a relationship with kids, the wife wants to forget about the old, which he is clean, and has changed but a lot of people can't start anew with that person tooo much collateral damage.
It's alot about loss and how you handle it. It's very educating to those that might be addicts and I think it should be used in all re-habs.

This series, ""The Cleaner"" is one of two of my favorite dramas on television. I love the fact that it is based on a true account of an individual's life and what he struggled with being addicted to drugs. It is a show of hope and faith. Anyone can get off of drugs if they have a great support system and faith in God. I truly believe that drugs is one of the greatest tools that Satan has against our youth in this country.

I ultimately hated it due to it's setting in California and terrible haircuts on everyone. All of this would be easily forgiven if only it were somehow based on a true story.
