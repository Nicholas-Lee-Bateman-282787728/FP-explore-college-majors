7868923,5,6304326351,"Peter chung is brilliant at his work.  Aeon flux mission infinite is another chapter to mtvs(the old mtv wich kicked ass that now sucks!)original series, a mad plan to change the course of human evolution. A mysterious underworld where time and memory are stopped and erased. A drooling mutant baby and a virus that causes insanity.  All chance encounters for Aeon flux anarchist and freedom fighter.
That is what AEON flux is a freedom fighter!  She fights for what she believes and so does solid snake. mmmmmmm.... Maybe solid snake and aeon flux should hook up and snake can dump meryl.  OK thats besides the point what you should do is get this amazing must have series and just like I said the first time, THIS IS A HARD TO FIND MOVIE!!!!

7868924,5,6304326351,"I usually despise MTV, it seems so trendy and worthless.  But everyonce in a while MTV does something good and takes a risk.  This was one of those times.  I couldn't picture any other network promoting a show like this.  It's anime but so much better.  Peter Chung is a genius, I have watched all of the episodes so many times, and I still barely get them and I always figure out a new thing everytime.  Describing the episodes is a fruitless exercise, watching them is the only valid way of explanation.  It's a beautiful thing.  I have only one wish, and that is that they made more.  I am done.",1013904000,5,598,4.315315315315315
7868925,5,6304326351,"Created by the brilliant mind of Peter Chung, Aeon Flux is easily one of the best American animated shows of the 20th Century. The first episode focuses on a species that has the ability to erase all memory. While Aeon deals with her nude pictures of her and Trevor, Aeon trys to help victims of the species. Aeon encounters a man who was affrected by this species who is trying to extince them all. After some chasing around and finding out some secrets, the man Aeon was trying to help loses his memory forever. In the second episode, Aeon and Trevor are bouth after a lab that contains a chemical for world wide happiness. This however leads to Aeon finding a mutant baby that plays with peoples minds. This leads Aeon into a new world. In the last episode, Trevor attempts to kill off half the human population in order to evolve into a species with no orafices. That episode was propably the best one. One thing very keen about the show is that the plot moves either extremly fast or extremly slow. Either way, the three episodes on here are exelelnt, easily worth buying.",996451200,4,1077,4.528205128205128
