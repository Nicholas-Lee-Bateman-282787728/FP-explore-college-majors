This is a Rockpalast show from 1984 and it  might even be worth owning...but the video is not only second generation at best but this company Immortal continues in its tradition of taking old full screen shows, stretching them to widescreen  format (everyone gets a bit fatter in the process) to make them seem more  current?
Unless you just have to have every bit of INXS on DVD you can get...wait for a legit release,  this has to be some sort  of boot... I'd sell mine but the prices are dropping fast!",1270771200,10,621,4.3652173913043475
8382174,5,B002VKE0WG,Great dvd bit grainy but we're talking about the 80's here.  I love it and takes me back to those great days. Awesome.,1438905600,,118,4.130434782608695
8382175,5,B002VKE0WG,"Hi, I'm a massive INXS/  Michael Hutchence fan & this video is priceless to see him & the band performing just before they became so well known & famous..I'll treasure this for ever, many thanks, Laura Kittson",1429401600,,209,4.648648648648648

8382177,5,B002VKE0WG,"As it is unfortunate that I never got to see INXS in concert with Hutch, I'm glad I bought this as it's as close as I'll ever get.",1390262400,2,130,3.6785714285714284
8382178,4,B002VKE0WG,"This is not a good quality DVD but I did not have a copy of this just to have but I did enjoy anything INXS did. The last I saw Michael was his last show in San Francisco at the Warfield,,,,he loved performing here as it was small and intimate....they were filming but I never found anything from the footage from that show...guess I never will too bad,,,,he was great",1362528000,,368,4.271428571428571
8382179,4,B002VKE0WG,"Yes the aspect ratio is off...yes the audio isn't the best. But hey you get a chance to see the band before they found out they were cool and before the money changed them.  You get to Michael young and really trying to perform. The venue is smaller not some huge stadium.

If you're a big INXS fan and like their earlier stuff (Sha Bo Sha Ba) you will enjoy this.  If you're looking for a polished band playing the big radio hits this one is not for you.",1349136000,2,455,4.089887640449438
8382180,5,B002VKE0WG,Wonderful concert film! A great memorial to Michael Hutchence. Great music! High energy as always. A must for INXS fans,1319932800,5,119,5.0
8382181,5,B002VKE0WG,"Excellent this release seeing the light of day to begin with, but man, major WOW FACTOR for the quality and content.  The entire televised concert is included from start to finish w/ crystal clear near-perfect video and audio.  It looks and sounds as if it were recorded yesterday.  It's good to see Nik get the kind of treatment he so richly deserves.  Buy it!",1308268800,,361,4.59375
8382182,5,B002VKE0WG,"Nik Kershaw is a figure that existed in the back alleys of 80's pop music.  He never made the Top 40 in the U.S., but he took Europe by storm.  The pinnacle of his popularity came with his movie soundtrack success ""Wouldn't It Be Good"" (from Pretty in Pink)  It stands today as his most recognizable and memorable work.

But this team of rare talent (Kershaw and his various backups) turned a tide in music industry from behind the scenes.  Clever innovations reminiscent of forms and techniques used in jazz and classical music performance invoked by this group in recording studios and on stage pushed an evolution that helped usher in new phases in Popular music.  As a pop singer and musical talent, he is a true unsung hero.

Lyrics are thematically witty with eccentric signal-flares and almost iconic culture references. Musical underpinnings are riveting exhibitions in virtuosity and  tempo.  If you have heard his standards from studio and you think that is pushing things over the top, take a listen to this video presentation.  Setting aside the 27 year old recording standards and the nostalgic fashion statements and performance modes, this concert is a runaway train of continuous full throttle performances using dynamic and intricate virtuoso techniques in a firestorm of flirtatious skits. What you see on this video is a die-hard rock team hard-selling in a no holds barred barrage of musical bon-bons.

If you crave a little undiscovered 80's binge, you can't go wrong with this underdog.  He and his crew had mastered showmanship in this documented high-point in a struggling artist's career.

Recommended, especially to the Kershaw fandome.",1307491200,,1662,5.0661764705882355
8382183,5,B002VKE0WG,"Michael sounds great, is great, and looks absolutely gorgeous. I am a huge fan of Michael Hutchence. I happen to think he's the best frontman of all time. Naturally, I want everything of Michael's!!! If you are a fan like I am, everything with Michael is so worth it!!!",1288396800,6,269,4.510204081632653
