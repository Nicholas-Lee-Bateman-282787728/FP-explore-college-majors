3701508,5,B001MVWMI4,Bless Amy Poehler and her silly self for helping create The Mighty B! This cartoon is hilarious and AWSHOME!! I am over 30 and love this show! Running With The Rainbow Unicorn Karaoke Video was enough to make me buy it!,1269475200,,219,4.365853658536586
3701509,5,B001MVWMI4,"I have seen the Mighty B! several times on Nickelodeon and, unlike many animated shows, it managed to keep my attention and garner a few knee slappers.  These episodes are fast-paced, witty, and genuinely hilarious.  ""We got the Bee"" is my favorite, but all the episodes will leave you smiling.  Great buy!",1254355200,,306,4.846153846153846
3701510,5,B001MVWMI4,"I have a 5 1/2-year-old son and a 4-year-old son and the ""The Mighty B!"" is their favorite show. It is also one of the few shows that I truly enjoy watching with them, and we were all thrilled when it came out on DVD. It is very smartly written and brilliantly animated, unlike so many other cartoons, and we laugh together through every episode (the boys love to quote the lines). I would highly recommend this hilarious show to kids and adults alike. We can't wait for the new season to start!",1252195200,3,495,4.333333333333333
3701511,5,B001MVWMI4,We love the Mighty B and this video is great.  We would love merchandise based on the Mighty B like t-shirts.,1240358400,4,109,4.190476190476191
3701512,5,B001MVWMI4,"I purchased The Mighty B! We Got the Bee  DVD for my daughter since she loves this show on Nickelodeon. When it arrived I ended up watching all the episodes with her. The main character, Miss Bessie is indeed a very funny, lovable and original character. I especially think her enthusiasm is refreshing- She is quirky and amusing without being snide in the least bit.  My daughter and I laughed a lot at her clever dialogue and the story lines are great. I also liked the design of the characters, especially the mother and Happy.  The whole look of the show is rich with its rolling hills in the background and the high angles in some scenes- it feels quite 3D!  One more thing that is great about having this particular dvd on hand: I can pop it in while I am making dinner and the music and voices of this dvd are actually something I am happy to hear in the background. Hooray!",1238716800,5,881,4.353658536585366
3701513,5,B001MVWMI4,"I love Mighty B! and I love Bessie Higgenbottom (and Happy, her dog).  This show is very, very funny and Amy Poehler is great.  I was very happy that my favorite episode, Sweet Sixteenth, is on this DVD. It is really funny and kind of gross in a good way.  I like seeing how they make the show, too - they have included Bat Mitzvah Crashers in early form, which is very cool.",1237334400,4,375,4.109589041095891
3701514,5,B001MVWMI4,"This is the first DVD that Nickelodeon has released of the Mighty B! which is the best cartoon since Sponge Bob.  There are 8 different episodes - We Got the Bee, So Happy Together, Sweet Sixteenth, Bee My Baby, Bee Afraid, Artificial Intelligence, Bat Mitzvah Crashers and Super Secret Weakness.  The title episode features a great song ""Running with the Rainbow Unicorn"" and the extras include interviews with series star Amy Poehler and Andy Richter, who plays Bessie's little brother, Ben.  It is great to finally get a DVD of this show since Nick doesn't show it as often as I wish they would!  I can't wait for them to release the whole first season, but in the meantime, these are some classic episodes!",1237334400,9,710,4.701612903225806
