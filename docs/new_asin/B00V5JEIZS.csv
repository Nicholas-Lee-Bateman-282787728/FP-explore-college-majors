7076987,5,B00V5JEIZS,"Excellent treatment because of the comments and commentary,  Much of film is stock but that is acceptable if in context as here.  Avoids the horrible background musical score and deafening volume that Overwhelms too many  documentaries of this type ( Most horrendously and unhappily, ""Victory At Sea"").  Valuable addition to my library.",1466812800,,336,5.403846153846154

7076990,5,B00V5JEIZS,Most of the film footage has been around on all the other documentaries which is to be expected. Additional details and valuable eyewitness accounts add to the chapters. I was happy that there was no loud annoying music overplaying the video as in some programs I have seen.,1455148800,4,274,4.729166666666667

7076995,3,B00V5JEIZS,"In fact, I thought this was the DVD version of the great Ronald Spector book by the same name.  This DVD is for those that want the Cliffs Notes of the war in the pacific, I mean the 100,000 foot high version.  The quality of the video is fair, some would argue less than fair.  Some of the conclusions in the film are glossed over and lots of important events omitted.  This was probably created for the AHC or similar channel that has a budget.  So, if you want to get the high level view of what happened and not necessarily why it happened nor too much detail, then this may be for you.  If you want a riveting, detailed, thoroughly absorbing account of the events, what really happened, and the painstakingly detailed whys, of the war in the pacific, get the Spector book.  I am giving this 3 stars because, I cannot give it 2 1/2 stars.",1441238400,9,842,4.291139240506329

8709333,4,B00V5JEIZS,"The most renowned documentary series on WWII in the Pacific are the 1951 ""Crusade in the Pacific"" and the 1952 ""Victory at Sea"" (which includes coverage of some naval operations in Europe as well). Both are about 10 hours in length as against the 7.5 hours for ""Eagle Against the Sun"".

This series distinguishes itself from the other two mentioned above in that (1) there is a good amount of film footage (especially from Japanese cameras) not found in the other two, (2) there is greater coverage of Japanese history, culture and motivations than would have been possible in the early 1950s, and (3) there are interviews with historians and with participants of key actions.

So, this set is a welcome complement to documentaries on WWII in the Pacific, especially for anyone who already knows quite a bit and has long wished for something substantially more.

On the negative side, however, the narration moves quickly in a rather perfunctory, script-reading fashion without setting up key events and operations systematically for those viewers who don't already have a good background in the war. For viewers new to WWII in the Pacific, then, it may seem like an endless linear recitation of dates and places where nothing is made to seem more important than anything else. It's hard to think that this would be a good first introduction to WWII in the Pacific, since in the end you don't get the few dozen key takeaways that an overview should give you.

Film footage seems not very well coordinated at times with the actual events under discussion. For example, a short clip in the context of an early 1942 event shows Nimitz with five stars, which didn't happen until December 1944. Later, in the context of the fall of the Philippines we see footage that includes Admiral King (who isn't identified for the viewer nor even relevant to the topic at hand) wearing the fifth star he got only much later. Perhaps those are just careless editing errors, but as a result we can't feel fully confident of any footage. With ""Crusade in the Pacific"" and ""Victory at Sea"", film coordination with the events has always seemed unimpeachable. Furthermore, a fair amount of footage is merely randomly-inserted short clips of planes attacking ships, ships firing guns, etc., and we don't know which side is which, or where and when this is taking place, since the narrator gives no identifying information. It's just filler that doesn't illustrate the specific events at hand.

As an aside, the best version of ""Crusade in the Pacific"" is now the one issued in 2011 by MPI Home Video (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crusade-in-the-Pacific/dp/B005E7SENE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crusade in the Pacific</a>). It's expensive, but unlike the cheaper ones, it includes the full opening and ending credits for every episode and better prints. All other editions, available cheaply, are based on TV syndication prints from decades ago that stripped out the opening and ending credits in order to gain an additional minute or two for more commercials.",1530835200,,3077,5.121513944223108

8709337,5,B00V5JEIZS,"This was a HUGE surprise, one of the best WWII documentaries I've watched. Too many docs tend to use the same footage and shallow story line. This one really goes into detail. No matter how much of a history buff you are, odds are you are going to learn something with this set. After seeing Hacksaw Ridge and reading The Old Breed I felt I needed to brush up on my history a bit and bought several DVD sets on Amazon, this one was by far the best.",1487376000,3,448,4.1022727272727275
8709338,5,B00V5JEIZS,"Despite having a huge amount of documentaries and other films about WW2, I still learned some new things.  Even WW2 buffs might find things of interest.  For WW2 novices, I highly recommend this DVD as a way to initiate your knowledge of this history changing event.  As expected, this is black and white but the sound is excellent.  Visual quality is certainly adequate considering the technology of the time and the circumstances inherent in combat photography.",1486080000,,463,5.052631578947368
