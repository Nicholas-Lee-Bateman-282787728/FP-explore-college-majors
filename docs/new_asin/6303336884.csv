627373,2,6303336884,"After joining forces in 1993's ""Back In Action"", Billy Blanks and ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper reunite for this dismal follow-up. This time, Blanks is a special agent with amnesia and Piper is the bounty hunter trying to keep him alive long enough to figure out who he is.
The action sequences aren't as spectacular this go around and the story gets tired fast. Fans of either may want to check out but overall, it's very underwhelming.",1063324800,,427,4.706666666666667

Piper and Blanks team up to kill a bunch of dirty CIA drug smugglers. Based on a true story. I own the VHS tape. I like the VHS box art. I made up the based on a true story part.",1447459200,,324,4.0

7843949,2,6303336884,I like Billy Blanks and I love Roddy Piper.  Saying that...this movie SUCKED!  I wouldn't recommend unless you collect movies.  Its hard to find this one in stores but that for a reason.  Its so baaaaddddd.  Watch this only to torture your eyeballs.  Be warned.,1420502400,,261,4.688888888888889

I really was hoping that they could have sent me a copy that could have worked but i left several messages and nothing has happen. I purches many films so ihope that this would be resolved for me.

7843953,4,6303336884,"As far as B-movie martial arts/buddy flicks go, the second team-up between ex-pro wrestling star Roddy Piper and seven-time world karate champion Billy Blanks ranks high as a thoroughly enjoyable time-killer. Swift-paced, ripe with hand-to-hand fights, and never taking itself too seriously, the film is a great example of how to achieve a fun time with only minimal resources and two talented, underrated stars. Fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Weapon/dp/630213014X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Weapon</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showdown-in-Little-Tokyo/dp/6305161992/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showdown in Little Tokyo</a>&nbsp;and the like will certainly find some level of enjoyment in this oft-forgotten little gem.

The story: John Portland (Blanks,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-the-Kickboxers/dp/6302128161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of the Kickboxers</a>) is a CIA agent whose last mission ends in catastrophe due to internal corruption. Wounded and stricken with amnesia, he enlists the help of private investigator Elmo Freech (Piper,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Live/dp/B0000AOX0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Live</a>) in order to reclaim his past and eventually expose a case of drug-trafficking involving officials deep within the nation's security organizations.

Yes, the story is one for the dogs, but it generally plays in the background while Blanks and Piper bounce off of eachother in front of the camera. While I wouldn't list them among the great acting duos of cinema, the unlikely pair has definite chemistry that was evident in their previous venture (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-in-Action/dp/6303117724/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back in Action</a>) and even more so here. Their charisma doesn't depend on situation and seems more sincere than any of the acting; I'd be very surprised if they weren't friends behind the scenes. Beyond this, however, there is not an abundance of great acting to be seen: the two stars carry most of the scenes on their own and their charm carries them, but seeing Charles Kahlenberg and James Karen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B000068IEV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of the Living Dead</a>) as good/bad FBI agents, Lisa Stahl as Piper's quasi-girlfriend, and Phil Morris (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible/dp/B005MQ5840/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission: Impossible</a>) as an all-around bad guy isn't always very pleasant. Passable, perhaps, but not pleasant.

Luckily, we have a boatload of good action scenes to fall back on: there's only one short gunfight, but about ten assorted brawls split between the martial artist and the pro wrestler. Piper manages to keep his fisticuffs entertaining, but as expected, Blanks' encounters are the more impressive ones: he doesn't have any particularly outstanding opponents, so as with Piper, most of his fights are beat-'em-up affairs but nevertheless spiced up with some very impressive jump-kicking and nifty leg takedowns. There's a cool instance wherein he springs up from a crouched position to deliver a one-two kick to a fellow in a chair, before which he kicks a man out the windshield of a moving car. Two lackluster fights with the usually-awesome Richard Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-Hunter/dp/B00008WJE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City Hunter</a>) disappoint but don't ruin the film. The choreography is generally fine, providing good ebb and flow to the fights, and most of the encounters are shot without visual compromises or extensive post-production editing: it's all about what was gotten on the set and this is pretty good.

The limitations imposed by a DTV budget are covered up pretty well by director Steve Cohen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martial-Law/dp/6301979869/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martial Law</a>), so aside from some of the questionable dramatic performances, the only thing that works against the movie is its own god-given stupidity, but since you already knew you already knew weren't going in for anything intellectual when you bought this film, this oughtn't bother action fans. I can't speak for Roddy Piper's film career, but ""Tough and Deadly"" is among Billy Blanks' best movie outings. Fans of his definitely ought to own it, while action devotees in general shouldn't be disappointed in buying it blind.",1244073600,2,4781,6.884488448844884
7843954,5,6303336884,"If you like Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson, then you might like Billy Blanks.  This project really coalesced in 1992, when director/producer Sam Cohen envisioned the plot for Tough And Deadly in an opium den in Buenos Aries.  In a legendary ""pull up"" scene, Piper tickles Blanks and they roll around in the park.  ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper actually learned English for this movie, although you would never know it.  If you only see one movie named Tough And Deadly, put this one near the top.",1180742400,,479,4.666666666666667
