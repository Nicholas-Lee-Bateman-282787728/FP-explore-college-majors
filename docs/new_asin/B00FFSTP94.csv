5990680,5,B00FFSTP94,"The person who rated this a 1 star is not good at math... 16.46 + 40.26 + 34.96 = 91.68 (for DVD) and 21.15 + 33.99 + 40.52 = 95.66 (for Blu-ray) which means it is MORE to purchase these INDIVIDUALLY than in the BUNDLE! If you are going to rate something 1 star because you feel it is 2x something, make sure you do the math first. This is a good deal and it is worth it if you don't have any of the seasons to date.",1387324800,4,416,3.7386363636363638

5990691,5,B00FFSTP94,"My 15 year-old daughter begged and begged to watch this series, but I was skeptical. I didn't know if it would be appropriate for her, so I started watching it to see for myself. People either love or hate this series, and without planning to be, I became a lover of TWD. If you happen to fall into the lover category, this series will suck you in, so don't start watching unless you have hours to dedicate to marathon watching. I had to buy the series on dvd so I can watch whenever, wherever. Now my daughter and I watch every Sunday and have shared many hours bonding over events that have happened on the shoe that we both liked.",1447286400,2,633,4.283333333333333

5990713,4,B00FFSTP94,Fantastic set of DVD's. I also ordered season four and received it.

5990714,4,B00FFSTP94,"I'm not reviewing the show, as I'd assume people purchasing have already seen/rented, but rather I'm commenting on a problem with the discs. They often stagger and go out of sync. Easily fixed by stopping play and resuming (pause doesn't work, but stop does) until it happens again. Perhaps it's my Blu ray player? Although, it's never happened before. And it did happen with every disc of this set (seasons 1-3) and also with season 4 (which, was also purchased from this seller - youLikeThis.) I'm always concerned that I'm getting a knock off. Because it's happened once before. Perfect set of another tv series - perfect meaning I couldn't tell at all that it was a copy... until ... an episode was missing. So, I have to wonder - is the going outta sync thing a sign that this is an unauthorized copy? Lastly, I don't understand why people review the CONTENT of movies/shows. If I wanted that I'd google it. I want info on the PRODUCT. Why would I look to Amazon for reviews of a movie/series?

I wouldn't care except that there are so many and they're so lengthy! You're BURYING the few reviews that do mention product specifics. I can't find them in the deluge of Roger Ebert wanna-be's novella like essays on the wonders and flaws of any given movie/series.

Examples of what would seem to me USEFUL information:
- is it a different region code (crucial info that is sometimes not noted.)
- does it appear genuine
- does the Blu ray seem better/worth the extra price?
ETC.  If you wanna do movie reviews, start a blog. If I need a review, then I will google and perhaps find your review amongst those from people who actually do it for a living.",1428019200,7,1653,4.540268456375839

5990789,5,B00FFSTP94,"i HAVE JUST FINISHED THE WALKING DEAD -FIRST SEASON AND I GOTTA' SAY THE SHOW PULLS YOU IN.
I DIDN'T KNOW BEANS ABOUT THIS SHOW SO I WAS TAKING A BIG CHANCE FOR A LOT OFMONEY BUYING SEASON 1S THROUGH 4 AND i AM SO GLAD THIS IS ANOTHER WINNER.- OFTENTIMES I BUY SOMETHING BASED ON REVIEWS AND FROM THE HUNDREDS - PROBABLY THOUSANDS SERIES I'VE PURCHASED (ALL FROM AMAZON OF COURSE) I HAVE ONLY ONE SET THAT WAS A STINKER AND ANOTHER THAT ISN'T HALF BAD BUT IS WAITING UNTIL I RUN OUTOF STUFF TO WATCH.

THE SHOW BEGINS WITH A COP THAT IS SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY AND WHEN HE WALKS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL HE FINDS NOBODY IS THERE EXCEPT DEAD PEOPLE STREWN AROUND THE GROUNDS AND HE IS BASICALLY THE ONLY' NORMAL ONE LEFT IN THE ENTIRE CITY. THE 'WALKING DEAD' ARE DEAD AND COMING BACK TO LIFE TO EAT WHATEVER THEY CAN FIND WHATEVER HUMAN THEY CAN FIND THAT IS STILL ALIVE EVEN A HORSE;  ANYTHING THAT MOVES AND ISN'T DEAD AND IT'S PRETTY GROSS BUT I LIKE GROSS. THE SHOW IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART....PRETTY GORY IN PLACES BUT THEN I LIKE A LITTLE GORE MIXED IN.

SOON THE COP MAKES  HIS WAY THROUGH THE MAZE OF DEAD FOLKS TRYING TO GET TO HIM AND EAT HIM FOR THEIR DAILY MEAL. HE ESCAPES THEM OH SO CLEVERLY AND MAKES IT OUT OF TOWN BY A HAIR AND MEETS UP WITH WIFE AND CHILD WHO HIS PARTNER HAS BEEN 'SCREWING' THINKING HIS FRIEND WAS DEAD.
THOUGH A SET OF
CIRCUMSTANCES. HE MAKES IT BACK TO WHERE HIS WIFE AND CHILD AND OTHERS ((INCLUDING THE COP WHO IS SCREWING HIS WIFE) HAVE FOUND A BIT OF A REFUGE.

THE STORYLINE IS FANTASTIC AND THE ACTORS ARE SUPER GOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHY I TOOK A CHANCE ON THIS  PRETTY EXPENSIVE SET OF DVD'S BUT I DID AND ONCE AGAIN PICKED A WINNER.

I AM SO ANXIOUS TO SEE SEASON 5 I WILL GET A SEASON PASS ON MY KINDLE FIRE FOR I DOUBT THE DVD WILL BE OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME AT A VERY HIGH PRICE AND WHEN I FINISH SEASON 4 I KNOW I WILL WANT TO SEE THE NEXT INSTALLMENT IMMEDIATELY WHETHER I CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT-MOSTLY NOT.

IF YOU LIKE DRAMA (NOT MUCH TO LAUGH ABOUT IN THIS ONE) AND PERSONALITIES RUNNING HIGH THIS IS A SHOW FOR YOU. CHECK OUT ONE OR TWO SHOWS AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

5990820,3,B00FFSTP94,"I love this show. I do. This show deserves the full five stars. The packaging for this bundle however, was disgraceful. Someone was obviously not paying attention to what they were doing when they shipped it out because the bundle wasn't fully cushioned in the air bags to prevent damage. Separating the cases showed damage to the cases. Corners were broken or cracked. The little teeth that hold the disks in place were broken off on the 'front' and 'back' of the bundle. The first disk of season one was sliding around freely in the case and had scratches all over it. (Thankfully, they were minor and didn't affect the playback of the disk.) I immediately felt like I should have just paid extra at Wal-Mart to get packaging I knew wouldn't be damaged. Perhaps someone was having a bad day at shipping. I don't know. But they need to show a little more caution with things that others would consider valuable to them. I'll be replacing the cases when I find some that can hold all the disks.

But this show is amazing. It just keeps getting better as it goes on. I can't wait for season 5 this October.",1407110400,26,1105,4.497512437810945

5990825,5,B00FFSTP94,"Wow.  This show is brilliant.  My parents, sister, brother; everyone has been trying to get me to watch this and I was on the fence.  I couldn't picture myself getting into a gory horror show about a Zombie Apocalypse.  I watched the pilot episode at my sister's and I was immediately hooked.  It's amazing.  Yes, it's gory but it's so character driven and the writing is brilliant.  The actors are fantastic. I love these characters and I want them to survive this crazy screwed up world.  You just become so wrapped up in their lives and their struggle to just get through each day and it's heartbreaking when you lose one of them.  Nearly every episode, I am an emotional wreck, scared, hiding behind my hands and hanging by the edge of my seat on this non-stop thrill ride.  I am in love with this show and would put it right up there with Game of Thrones.  You don't even have to be a horror fan to enjoy this because it's so much more than that, you just need a love for brilliant, character-driven story telling.

I wanted a digital copy of the show to load on my kindle and these DVDs did not have digital copies.  Upon further research, I couldn't find digital copies anywhere other than to purchase them outright for exorbitant cost from Amazon or iTunes.  Still, this is one of the best shows on TV right now (aside from Game of Thrones). I just wish AMC would put a little more love into their DVD collections. Take the example from HBO.

I have read the first 12 graphic novel collections of the comic, so it may seem like I know what will happen but like real life: you cannot predict the future.

I think special effects are a dying art and love when the use them it sort of reminds me of old horror movies like the Evil Dead and Friday the 13th movies. Its like a B-movie zombie movie come to life with a big budget and better actors which is a good thing. Cool and interesting characters and some that you don't care about so much.

The thing is, this show isn't really even about zombies.  You can insert any type of apocalypse you prefer:  zombie, asteroid, solar flare, religious, etc.  This is a series focusing on the human element; on how humanity can hold on and continue living through hardships.  Yes, this has zombies (and to great effect), but overall this series is about people holding onto their humanity despite great odds against it.
