1905210,5,B0000ADXE9,"SpiderBabe (2002) was and probably still is Seduction Cinema's most spectacular and glamorous motion picture production.  Bringing together the likes of the gorgeous Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Julian Wells, and Kelli Summers, directorJohnny Crash, takes  SpiderBabe far beyond erotica for erotica's sake and sets his sights on producing a movie that can hold its own in terms of comedy, action, and special effects.  Of course, there is still plenty of Seduction Cinema's trademark nudity and sizzling moments incorporated into the production, but the seamier moments were removed in the R-rated version of the film (in an effort, I imagine, to extend the company's reach to consumers who might not be familiar with the films and starlets of the world's best erotic B-movie production company).  The SpiderBabe DVD offers the best of both worlds - if you buy the right package.  It is not always overtly obvious, but there are two different SpiderBabe releases - I urge you not to buy the single-DVD release because it includes only the R-rated version of the film plus a few extras; what you want is the ""two-disc collector's edition DVD.""  The two-DVD version includes both the R-rated version and the unrated version plus an abundance of additional extra features.
As you might have guessed, SpiderBabe is a parody of the film SpiderMan.  The delectable Misty Mundae plays Patricia Porker, a shy and quite nerdy college student who is ridiculed constantly by her classmates.  There is actually a parallel here between the character and Misty herself, for Misty is a very intelligent young lady who is shy and rather nerdy at heart.  Anyway, Patricia gets bitten by a hybrid, radioactive spider.  Naturally, she develops super powers (including a powerful sex drive) and becomes a crime-fighting superhero; she can even shoot her own spider webs (which do not come out of her hands or wrists, and that's all I will say about that).  Needing money for her new apartment, Patricia signs up to wrestle the Queen Bee at Madison Square Garden, and soon thereafter, when a personal tragedy hits home, she accepts the responsibility of using her special powers to fight evil (and to - shall we say - get to know other people very well).  While she is out keeping the city safe from bad guys, her own personal nemesis is borne in the form of Femilian (Julian Wells).  Before long, SpiderBabe is attacked in the pages of the Daily Bungle and set up to look like a criminal or, at best, a clumsy would-be hero.  Everything soon spirals toward an ultimate showdown with Femilian.
It goes without saying that Misty Mundae turns in a magnificent performance (even if she does look pretty silly jumping around New York City in that crazy SpiderBabe costume); it was especially enjoyable to see her take on all the baddies and leave them lying in her wake.  Julian Wells does a pretty good job playing the Jekyll/Hyde-like Lucinda Knox/Femilian character (but that fake accent is just annoying), Darian Caine is wonderful in what amounts to a supporting role, and I was quite pleased to finally meet up with the lovely Kelli Summers once again.  All of the action and special effects are rather cheesy, as you might expect, but some (certainly not all) of the special effects actually turned out to be rather impressive.
Let me describe the differences in the R-rated and unrated versions of SpiderBabe because there are important differences.  You will surely be tempted to watch the unrated version first, but I would strongly suggest you start with the R-rated version.  The fact is that the editing of the unrated version makes a mess of the plot - in conjunction with the added naughty scenes, you also find a number of scenes from the R-rated version shortened or removed entirely.  Lost in this process are some of the funniest scenes in the movie as well as a number of necessary plot points; you also have the absurdity of an important event being reported on the news before it even happens.  If I had watched the unrated version first, I would have come away thinking this was a horrible movie.
The two-disc collector's edition DVD comes with a huge bounty of extras: three deleted naughty scenes (of pretty hot material); behind-the-scenes featurettes on the making of the film and the special effects used in the film; a look at the evolution of the SpiderBabe costume; an ""Out There TV"" clip featuring Misty Mundae and Julian Wells in a saucy additional scene; several minutes of out-takes and bloopers; interviews with Misty Mundae, Julian Wells, and director Johnny Crash;  a nice SpiderBabe photo gallery; trailers to a number of other Seduction Cinema films; and a music video (plus a making-of-the-video featurette) from the band Punishment featuring Misty Mundae (quite fun to watch).
I'm not saying SpiderBabe is a work of cinematic art, but it's not really supposed to be.  This is just great entertainment bursting with action, comedy, and the drop-dead gorgeous Misty Mundae.  I loved every minute of it.",1084233600,69,5016,4.938168846611177
1905211,5,B0000ADXE9,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was going to be close to other films i.e. Play-mate of the Apes, Lord of the G-Strings, but no.  They just played around with the story line, which in my opinion was great.  THis movie is too funny not to laugh.  Misty Mundae and Julian Wells perform very well.  There are a lot of mustakes, but you have to realize that this is bringing back cheesy films.  I would not pay to see a cheesy hollywood film for like $9.00, but for this movie I would waste $18, just to see it again that day.",1082505600,2,539,4.095238095238095
1905212,5,B0000ADXE9,"I'm not the biggest fan of B movies, but I do like them, yet rarely love them. Although I'll admit I loved SpiderBabe, which with a slightly bigger budget coulda been a successful theatrical release if audiences caught on.  Misty Mundae is an actress who has left me curious ever since watching the very cheesy Play-Mate Of The Apes accidently on cable a while back.  She is the only reason I gave SpiderBabe a chance and I'm very glad I did.  The film follows the formula of Spider Man to the degree that most spoof films usually do, and almost every gag worked for me.  The thing that I found most appealing about the film though, was the incredible score, which is phenomenal for a B movie, it's certainly not the best score I've heard, but it does stand out.  I really loved this movie.",1078704000,6,790,4.4206896551724135

I really enjoyed the parody of the Bonesaw wrestling match.  The production values in this movie are much higher than typical for a Seduction Cinema film.

I wasn't expecting much from this movie but this movie crushed my already low expectations.  To say the movie is laughable is giving it credit for being worse than bad.

1905232,1,B0000ADXE9,"Just so you know (because it wasn't told to me directly thanks to the misleading way it was advertised) Spiderbabe is a porno, not a parody on Spiderman.  The actual segments concerning a woman getting bit by a spider and spraying her victims with a gooey web are few and far between- it's all about a college girl fantasizing about girls in an erotic manner and placing herself in imaginary situations and environments such as a boxing ring, a college campus and her bedroom.

There's no enticing storyling or characterization connected to any of this, so... let's not kid ourselves, this is a porno.  At first it would seem the spiderbabe likes men, but we soon discover she definitely prefers the ladies.  The best scene by far is the one where the spiderbabe saves a helpless young woman from a group of city thugs and, alright, the part where she's sitting outside at a park table and web-attacks this terrible bully sitting on the other side and yells names at her is memorable too.

1905234,2,B0000ADXE9,"Why Misty, why? You have proven you have real talent and to give in the the dorkbirds that wanted to do this nonesense is pathetic. For one thing you look a little bit blubbery , not the best presentation for your most expensivle role. I am sorry darling, its the truth. You have so much ability and this was a waste of your looks and talent. Who was the one who convinced you to make this abominaton of a movie. You're running down the road was probably the most comical part of the movie,as you looked like a fullback heading through the line. Is this what you you want?

Misty was not the one for this role .She is a sensitive and emotional actress,and has proven this time and again. Her round face, her big thighs and her large butt confirm that she is not the one for such a presentation as this. It is a shame that she may be remembered for this peice of trash as SHO time put up the money for this. In the post screening interviews she appears lethargic and down right irritated. This was not her type of movie. For better or worse Misty likes movies that take aout 4-5 days to shoot .Anything else and she is getting irratable at everyone .

She does not consider herself as a star and wants to get the thing over with and head back home to her guitar and cat.",1308182400,,1269,4.19672131147541
1905235,4,B0000ADXE9,"Spiderbabe: 7 out of 10: It is important to note I am comparing Spiderbabe to other films in the naked lesbian chicks that guys like to watch genre. I am not comparing it to other big budget superhero movies (though it is better than Spiderbabe or Catwoman) or movie parodies (nice to see one without Leslie Nielson though), nope strictly the soft-core lesbian porn for guys genre. In that category, Spiderbabe is certainly well above average.

While not as good as say Lord of the G-Strings or Embrace of the Vampire it marks a vast improvement over two recent Misty Mundae films, the equally atrocious Lust for Dracula and New York Wildcats. Unlike those two films, you will not be fast-forwarding through the plot. In Fact unlike those two films, you will not be fast-forwarding throughout the sex scenes either.

Spiderbabe does not suffer from the ""good lord put your clothes back on honey"" third tier actresses that often appear in these films. All the girls here are quite attractive. Yet strangely, since the lesbian sex scenes are not the most inventive ever created and there is no real erotic tension between the characters, it is the filler that stands out the most.

Spiderbabe is a surprisingly expansive point-to-point deconstruction of the first Spiderman movie. Everything from the tryout as a wrestler to the battle with the Green Goblin is given an erotic twist. In addition, you will never guess from where Spiderbabe shoots her web (hint it is not her wrists).

While not as funny as G-Strings or erotic as Embrace, Spiderbabe deftly mixes lesbian sex scenes and spot on parody into an entertaining romp. If you like your lesbian porn with humor or for that matter your humor with attractive naked chicks Spiderbabe is for you. Moreover, lets all hope no one does an erotic remake of the Hulk shall we.",1257811200,2,1823,4.814696485623003
1905236,4,B0000ADXE9,"As is my way, I skip the plot rehash -- you can get that anywhere else.

As far as a parody goes, this was actually pretty decent. It was funny, very true to the Spiderman movie, and had some clever scenes and lines. i liked that the star had natural breasts.

The sex scenes were about a 3 on the hotness scale of Skinemax level ""porn"". Unfortunately, as with most of the soft-core that makes it to cable, it has a bit too much plot. That's not a bad thing if you're looking for a funny, sexy movie to watch with your lover, but it's not a great movie for background, as you spend too much time either laughing or fast-forwarding through the plot bits.

High-lights:

The wrestling scene. I'm not as fond of the stripper/porn boobs, but it was a cute scene, and a great distraction for the win!

Scene with her friend. Hot. Not hard-core level hot, but the ice-cube was a nice touch.

The ""kissing upside down in the rain"" with a twist.  Hot!

Low-lights:

The initial male/female scene.  Much less enjoyable than others in the film.

The scene with the newspaper woman. First, she wasn't that attractive, and second, it wasn't that hot.

The ending. Not a hot enough scene for the ""climax"".

On a whole, I recommend this movie just as a fun diversion to get you in the mood. While always enjoyable to watch on cable, it's probably worthwhile to have the DVD, simply because of the humor.",1231286400,2,1389,4.421259842519685

1905241,4,B0000ADXE9,"OK, this movie is sophomoric rubbish by any reasonable standard, but by the standard of the genre it stands out. Besides, there are times to suspend reason and just enjoy a guilty pleasure.

SpiderBabe is just that. Misty Mundae certainly has the ""It"" factor going for her, and she handles the part with humor and dexterity, even managing not to look embarrassed while running around Times Square amid perplexed pedestrians in her SpiderBabe costume (basically underwear and a mask). The script, which parodies Spiderman with most roles gender-reversed, is genuinely funny in parts. If you feel like switching off your brain for an evening and letting the 13-year-old inside of you out for a stretch, this is the right movie.

Incidentally, and somewhat counter-intuitively, the R-rated version in the two disc set is the superior one. The very extended sex scenes in the unrated version were accommodated at the expense of other scenes and dialogue. A couple of the cut scenes are actually important to the plot, and are amusing besides.",1130025600,20,1038,5.064327485380117

1905243,2,B0000ADXE9,"An attempted spoof on Spiderman, though really badly done. Seems like most of the production fundage went into the credits, as the effects used are quite impressive to start out with, but then the plot is ridiculously weak.

As Patricia Porker, a college freshman, there is an obnoxious and infantile antagonist who is dealt with by Spider Babe's interesting web shootng ability - not so much the ability iself, but rather from where it derives - and even this is used only twice in the entire film.

Spider Babe's costume is nicely revealing, and she goes through the process of self-discovery upon being bitten by a radio-active spider, etc., yet apparently, she is unable to swing from rooftops, but instead just runs about on foot, yet somehow has the ability to ""fly"" into a situation - perhaps more like gliding, if they took the original idea of Spiderman with underarm webbing into consideration. Anyhow, at least they could have granted her a ""Spider motorcycle"", which would have worked quite well.

While living with Auntie Maybe and Uncle Flem who themselves enjoy a sado-masochistic relationship, she begins her crime-fighting in the Spidey manner of competing in a wrestling match with an brutish woman, which turns into rough sex, to the pleasure of the audience. ""Uncle Flem"" is shot, so she embarks upon her mission as Spider Babe, and gains a lust/love interest in a jock-boy named ""M.J."", who himself at one point is persued by two gay clowns from out of a club named ""The Manholio"". One of the most notable scenes with he and Spiderbabe involved inversed suspended fellatio - a take on the Spiderman scene with Jane in the rain.

Her primary nemesis consists of ""The Femtilian"" - a blonde Amazon determined for world domination, who possesses some sort of energy ball. In an attempt to modify negative stories circulating in ""The Daily Bungle"" about Spiderbabe, Porker and a female JJ Jameson have some fun in the office.

Overall, the sex is soft-core, and mainly oral, although the actresses are quite attractive, and if there is one thing that this film does manage to accomplish, is in its remarkable wardrobe, quite Witchy, and it is recommended that sex vixens view this film if only for the dressing tips.

Spiderbabe {Misty Mundae} is herself fetishistically delectible, yet this may possibly be the worst parody yet, even by spoof standards, and comes no where near ""Lord of The G-Strings"".",1121731200,2,2419,4.916666666666667

But the effects are so cheesy it's actually funnier than the jokes. The only problem I have with the movie is that the sex scenes the movie was made for, really slow things down. It's like...""I get it. They're doin' it... Let's move it along."" But despite it's cheesy effects and super looooooooong sex scenes. I give this movie 3 stars. Why? Because it made me laugh folks.

Yes Misty is a little cutie and she does have some acting talant as long as you're not asking too much from her. With pure cheesiness and a cast that can go along with the gag, this movie barely squeaks by as something for all involved to be proud of.

This movie spoofs the recent SpiderMan movie. You got the wrestling match, which is probably the best sequence. The Killer Bee babe was the hottest chick in the whole flick. The evil lizard woman or whoever she's supposed to be is OK, but her assistant is really hot, too bad she fell out the window.

This movie is basiclly an excuse to make soft porn. There's a lot of nudity and NC-17 lesbian scenes. The nudity is obviously more important than the plot, so be prepared for the movie's plot to slow down everytime two women are on the screen at the same time.

Good for a few chickles, but nothing to go crazy over. Although it was cute how Misty shot out her webbing. It wasn't from her wrist.",1097280000,10,1096,4.20952380952381
