3785436,1,B001SFQ4JC,Just horrible!  Could not watch more than 10 minutes it was so weak.  Do not waste your time on this.,1394668800,,101,4.0
3785437,5,B001SFQ4JC,"This pieces all of the story together!  I was reading the book about this at the same time and it really helped to ""see"" the characters.",1357516800,3,136,4.230769230769231
3785438,1,B001SFQ4JC,"I thought Mena could act.  I don't think so anymore.  What a disaster.  She should pull this film from the market and start over.  My neighbor, who starred in her high school production of ""Little Shop of Horrors"", would have done better.  Shame on you Mena.  Burn and destroy this one.",1299888000,2,286,4.509803921568627
3785439,4,B001SFQ4JC,"...but at least it'll hold your attention. In quality of acting and tone of movie production, it's a notch above those true crime TV shows that have actors reproducing the events that ""went down"".  This movie also offers lots of viewpoints via this method with alternative scenarios and flashback scenes that try to recreate what happened and what could have happened along side the story which begins with his wife finding him dead and later being taken to trial.

The story is better than the production quality and acting perhaps.  It feels like a TV movie, with all the right scandalous ingredients - sex, lies and sin - it held my attention in the way an article from the Enquirer or some gossip mag would do.  The movie moves along and won't put you to sleep. No Oscars here or anything. Finally the question of whether or not she did it are left unresolved in the face of where they are today and we're left to chew on trial scenes and potential scenarios that reporters imagine as they wait for the verdict.",1256083200,7,1015,4.56043956043956

8339710,2,B001SFQ4JC,"The film is based on the true story of the death of former Vegas casino owner Ted Binion (Matthew Modine). His stripper girlfriend (Mena Suvari) becomes a suspect.

I was not aware of the story and didn't know the outcome which didn't make the film any better. This was a made-for-TV film that made it to DVD. The quality of the acting was uneven at best. The production was told with flashbacks. And of course that oh-so-popular made for TV faux drama sound track, that had me laughing during one of its sad piano tunes, that didn't achieve its intent.

Guide: No swearing, sex, lies, or sin.",1483660800,,593,4.5327102803738315

8339715,5,B001SFQ4JC,Mena was a great choice to play Sandy. She has one of the best bodies in Hollywood! Ted B and Sandy characters were just messed up and were easy to like and unlike. At the end both deserved what they got.,1400025600,,204,4.0
