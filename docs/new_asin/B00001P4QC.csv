1245975,4,B00001P4QC,"I wanted to say that I used to go to the Spike and Mike festivals every year when they came to my town. Little did I know that one day I would be featured in them . So all i ask is that you give this video a chance and check out CHESSMASTER THEATRE, that's mine. And if you like it then search for YOU ONLY DIE ONCE on amazon in dvd and video for my feature length James Bond Spoof. It's cheap and worth a few laughs.",1065916800,,417,3.75
1245976,3,B00001P4QC,"There are very few things in this world that have gotten the best of me.  Spike and Mike #5 has ruined me.  Some of the scenes are hard to watch unless you are a hardened criminal who has broken out of jail after 12 years and multiple rapes.  The beginning clips are pretty tame, but I had to put my head in a vice as the tape played on.  Hell- I thought I was sick and twisted.  It separates the men from the kids.",1015200000,2,415,3.892857142857143

1245978,4,B00001P4QC,"Well, I have watched most of the Spike & Mike Sick & Twisted VHS tapes and the DVDs (which I personally think the DVDs aren't as great as the VHS tapes are). But anyway, I never seen this tape (nor Vol 7) until a couple of years ago and thought it was very interesting. A real great mix of puppetry, hand drawn, clay animation. I will go through all the shorts that are on the tape:

Dreamboy: A floating head relays surrealistic stories and bizarre tales. I thought this one was kinda weird (mainly because the strange backgrounds and the ""Floating Head"" seems like he's mumbling the stories that he's telling) but from what I could ""get"" from this cartoon it has its comedy but overall wasn't that funny to me, but I will always remember that wooowhooo song at the end (totally 90s)

The Booby Trap: Nanna (which for those who don't know, Nanna is from Nana and Lil' Puss Puss, which is really funny and worth a look) is the most successful topless dancer at a gentleman's club. Jealous of her tremendous accomplishments, a battle ensues with another dancer. Really funny and gross short here (for example: when Nana and the Stripper are in a fight, she uses her Breasts' as weapons) This is defiantly worth a look and a chuckle.

Bambi Meets Godzilla: Bambi is contentedly nibbling the grass, seemingly unaware of his impending encounter with Godzilla. Good vintage comedy & animation (but it's really sickening how many times this was put out by spike and mike in their videos, I mean seriously guys it was good but not worth all the rehashing the same short in other releases, another reason why the DVDs aren't good) but it's worth a look if you haven't seen this.

Karate Dick Boys: The title says it all, group of young boys (I think, some look like chicks) use their ""Man Parts"" has swords. It's not really funny, but it was original, not worth a look if you're easily offended.

SICK AND TWISTED SPECIAL GAMES: A short that involves ""SPECIAL"" people partaking in Olympic sports. I believe that one of the narrators is Spike Deckor (I could be wrong). But it's a Politically Incorrect laugh riot, and would not recommend to those that are easily offended, but for others you'll have a good laugh at this one.

Slick Magnum .44: It a okay stop motion animated piece of a faux commercial for liquor/beer. I thought it was okay but nothing really special here.

Horndog: A animated piece about a dog that won't stop ""humping things"". I thought it was funny, but yet again, this is another short that Spike & Mike keep on rehashing to their ""New Releases"".

Doodie.com: A odd short about people's response to Poo, such as a man kiss his poo, the devil throwing his stool, and a Indian Man ""snake chanting"" his stool and as well as for some T.P. I personally enjoyed it as I couldn't believe how many references they made to DOODIE, some may not like it do to those references but I think it's worth a look.

COCO, The Junky Pimp: A puppet animation about COCO a Ex. Clown now turned junky and basically shows his downfall with doll hookers and excessive drug use. I thought it was funny, but at times didn't understand why it was in black n white (made no sense to me) worth a look

LLOYD IN ""How to get PRONGED"": Yes, Lloyd continues in his 4th (and final?) short film about how to get the ladies (and the ""lady ain't hot). Kind of funny in a ""Sick and Twisted"" sort of way. Worth a look

Jurassic Fart: Short is about dinosaurs farting. Not really much else to say but it not funny, and very unoriginal (I saw a short similar to this that was made in the 80s, but can't think of the name). Worth a look but only once, then FORGET ABOUT IT. And yet again ANOTHER REHASHED SHORT!

Hole In One: This one involves around a couple of middle aged men playing golf and one of the golfer's insults his friends and karma gets him pretty bad. Defiantly worth a look, it's funny, and it's original, it's good!

Smoking: A parody of those 50s-60s pro smoking ads of how good it's to smoke, but at the end has a STRONG ANTI-SMOKING MESSAGE, which is humorous and true. Worth a look if you're a anti smoker, but you'll be pissed if you're a smoker and see this.

The Devil went down to Georgia: This short is Epically Amazing, a feast for the eyes. It's basically tells the story of Charlie Daniels song ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"" but this version is done by Primus (which raises the cool factor to 11). The short is done by stop motion and puppetry mix. This is the short that made this whole video (to me) a four star video (if this wouldn't have been on here a 3 Star would have been given)
... Now to the 2nd most interesting short on the tape (1st being Devil went down to Georgia)

SLOACHES FUN HOUSE: Labeled as ""THE SICKEST SHORT EVER"" really lives out that title (That couldn't be stressed enough). It's very hard to describe this short, but I will try my best. It basically evolves around a ""Fun House"" that has two shown acts. ACT 1: A overweight (Morbidly Obese) man, that has nothing on but a toupee (???) and underpants (which don't stay on long) and preforms sexual acts on a sex doll (I think it was but could have been a ""dead"" doll) while eating roach invested pizza (YUM!) ACT 2: A pair of hideous looking humans (I think they were) both having ""Penises"" and ""Breasts"" and well performing sexual acts on each other. The short ends with the Overweight man pooping and smears the poop the glass window were we see/hear the crowd talking and laughing. I really could not comprehend what I was watching. I have seen MANY Spike and Mike shorts in my life (I even went to 2 actual festivals one in 03 and the other in 08) I even saw the New ""SICKEST SHORT"" Cuddle Sticks (and personally thought it was sick, but not the Sickest one I ever saw, thought Lloyds Lunch Box was a tad more sicker) but this short beats ""Cuddle Sticks"" by a LONG SHOT in sickness and being TWISTED,DISTURBING, VILE, GROSS, among other things. I (unfortunately) did some research on the short and found out that Spike and Mike took it out of their SICK AND TWISTED FESTIVAL Line-Up in 2001 (which explains why I NEVER SAW THIS IN THE DVD RELEASES). Maybe it was TOO SICK & TWISTED for Spike and Mike to handle??? But anyway, this short is just pure VILE, I would ONLY RECOMMEND THIS SHORT ONLY FOR: people who want to see the ""REAL"" Sickest short that Spike and Mike EVER SHOWN, or 2: to some sick messed up clay fetish people who love to see clay ""Humanoids"" preform sexual acts on themselves (which I'm sure their are in the world...?). Other than that I wouldn't recommend this short at all.

Overall the Spike & Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation Volume 5 is a generally good release that spike and mike put out in the Late 90s snd still kind of holds up today. Would defiantly recommend this tape over the early DVD releases that spike and mike put out (they sure do REHASH the shorts that were on the VHS Release to their DVD Releases, which wouldn't be bad if they did it once, but they do it over and over again with the DVD Releases that I stopped buying the New DVDs). Anyways good animation compilation of spike and mike's early to late 90s shorts that were shown at the festival. If you were to buy this, I recommend getting it for DOODIE.COM, Devil Went Down To Georgia, The Boobie Trap, and for those who want to see the REAL SICKEST SHORT THAT SPIKE AND MIKE EVER PUT OUT SLOACHES FUNHOUSE (which can be seen on another VHS tape that S&M put out SICKEST OF THE SICK, which cost more than this tape and that tape is a compilation of all the sickest shorts that S&M ever released on the Tapes).",1342483200,,7605,4.409836065573771
1245979,3,B00001P4QC,"Please note--the 19th entry on the disk is ""Heavy"", by Kellie McGregor"", not the claymation piece based on the Charlie Daniels Band song.  I bought this DVD expressly for this entry, based on the product information listed.  The other shorts are fine, but I was disappointed....",1307836800,,278,5.021739130434782
1245980,3,B00001P4QC,Not as good as I remember from the Spike and Mike fests. If your a fan of MTV's Liquid Television then chances are you'll love this!,1285977600,2,132,4.115384615384615
1245981,2,B00001P4QC,"I should have heeded the warnings of reviews on previous versions of this movie.  Or maybe I just had too high of expectations for this compilation. Whatever the reason was, I felt a little ""let down"" when i finally viewed this DVD.  I have been wanting to see one of these movies for about 15 years now since they started the tour. I was intrigued by the name ""sick and twisted animation"" Well maybe if I was still in my 20's this may have been a bit more interesting. But as an ""official grown-up"" now it wasn't.  I do appreciate the effort put forth into the making of these shorts, but they were just sort of lackluster.  One dog humping a stuuffed animal maybe fine, but this film featured 3 such shorts, which made me lose interest very fast. There were also a number of shorts about cats. If you like a guy named Bill Plympton, then maybe you will like this as several of the sketches are from him, otherwise I have to give this a big thuymbs down.",1254441600,2,955,4.288888888888889
1245982,4,B00001P4QC,"Ok, the other reviewer is whining about the lack of 3D.  Whatever.  This is basically a dvd which contains all the animations from Spike and Mike's Twisted Animation Festival, a traveling short animated film show with usually funny shorts.  All of this should be obvious to anyone looking at this item.

The DVD is standard fare and the content is mostly good.  The gem of which is, obviously, Dr. Tran.  A few of the others are misfires, but on a whole, worth the money for people that want to re-live the live showings.  If you're buying this strictly for Dr. Tran, you may be a little disappointed as all of the other shorts are from different people, and none, in my opinion, are up to Dr. Tran's standards.  You may want to consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Tran-Number-One-American-Icon/dp/B000IZJZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Tran: Number One American Icon</a>&nbsp;instead, which is a bunch of shorts from lonesausage, the creators of Dr. Tran.  In fact, go buy that too, even if you get this, its worth every penny.

Overall entertaining with a few misses.  But gee, I would have given it 400 stars if it was 3D...",1237420800,,1181,5.2287234042553195

1245984,2,B00001P4QC,"I like sick jokes and cartoons as much as the next guy. Why else would I buy a DVD like this? Unfortunately, the toons in this collection have no wit or point to them at all.

Example:""Teach Me""- Cartoon frogs mate in unusual positions, one frog kills the other with a razor and a knife, surviving frog continues to mate with the dead frog, then he pleasures himself while staring at the sun and his eyes burst into flames, The End.

I reiterate, I'm the kind of guy who considers American Psycho a comedy. These animations are not funny or insightful at all, just unpleasant to watch.",1113782400,5,585,4.457943925233645

While this DVD does contain many great films you should also check out this guys site [...] This is a friend of mine who just released his animation DVD. It is very funny, but he has no way of getting the word out. Check out his site and trust me, it's worth the price. He has a short on this Spike and Mike DVD, but he told me he doesn't see a dime anything they sell. Check out his site and please help support independent film making.",1097539200,,561,3.9298245614035086

Some of the other shorts on here though in my opinion are just messed up and sick. some of these you have to have a strong stomach for. But it is still a good dvd for those of you who like some sick and twisted humor in your cartoons every now and then like myself.  Why  not purchase this dvd and decide for yourself.
