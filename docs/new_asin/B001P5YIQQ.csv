3739112,5,B001P5YIQQ,"I've had this DVD for some time. Originally, I also thought it was slow and not very challenging, but when I got it out again recently, I went as heavy as I could handle and got a fantastic workout. The first workout goes through all the moves and you can perfect your form. The second one has combined kettlebell moves with short cardio intervals (this one is similar to Amy's other kettlebell DVD but not quite as demanding). It is a fantastic DVD. Well done instruction where you don't get hurt as a beginner, but grows with you beyond that. It really gives you a chance to go heavy without dread factor.",1275868800,9,607,4.428571428571429
3739113,5,B001P5YIQQ,"I have been looking for a good kettle bell workout after getting into kettle bell'n with Amy Dixon's ""Give Me 10"" workout video where she introduced kettle bells in her extra section. It was so much fun and so different than my other in-home workouts.

Okay, first off, you need to make sure to get a heavy enough kettle bell. For women, the recommended weight is 20 lbs!!! If you use a 5 or 10 lb kettle bell, you won't get the true benefits of the exercise routine. I am a 40+ women and I'm starting this workout with a 15 lb. kettle bell. This is the MINIMUM weight I would recommend. I'm a little wimpy on upper-body strength, although the real workout is lower body. The whole concept of the workout is swinging the heavy kettle bell around. Don't start with anything less than 15 lbs. 20-30 lbs. which will give you the ultimate challenge and you will build tremendous strength.

The video is excellent. It is made up of 3 sections. The first section is a tutorial on how to swing and handle the heavy weight. There are six exercises you will learn and are used throughout sections 2 and 3. Amy Bento demonstrates and explains each swing very well and this section gives you the opportunity to practice each of the exercises and prepare you for the 2 other sections.

The second section is for beginners, yet is quite challenging. You will feel like you really worked your muscles and it gets your heart rate going too. Even though she leads by herself (there are no other students), she makes it fun, challenging, and interesting. You basically move from each of the 6 exercises in a fast paced manner. The routine is 30 minutes and will work out all your muscles and get cardio work tool

The third section uses the same set on exercises, but she combines them into a series of swings for an even more challenging workout. In between each portion of kettle bell exercises, Amy adds cardio moves to keep your heart rate high. This is definitely a challenging workout!!!

My only grip on the workout is the stretching section. At the end of each section there is a very brief stretch that is unique for each workout. Then there is a section added to the end that is identical in each workout. This may be a style of Tammie Lee Webb who produced this video and also does this stretch repeat on her video. It would be better if they added a unique and longer stretch routine to complete the workout.

Overall, this is an excellent video for the beginner and will turn you into an intermediate kettle beller in no time if you stick to it!!!",1274400000,28,2543,4.458064516129032
3739114,3,B001P5YIQQ,I was a little disappointed with this video. I was hoping to really get my heart rate up but the instructor is slow with the moves and talks way too much.  I had been using a video that came with the kettlebell and was looking for a little more when I decided to try this one. It's much slower than what I had been using so I will go back to the old one.,1272067200,,354,3.7837837837837838
3739115,5,B001P5YIQQ,I have used this DVD a few times and it has great instructions for beginners.  I will be using this DVD often.  Amy takes her time explaining how to do each exercise and goes slowly so that you can follow along.,1268697600,15,211,4.121951219512195
3739116,5,B001P5YIQQ,"This is a really good DVD! There's a lot of great detailed information on here for anyone wanting to get into Kettlebell training. The sample workouts are great and brutal too ;)

Getting this free with a Kettlebell makes it an even better deal!",1265760000,8,245,4.568181818181818
3739117,5,B001P5YIQQ,"I'm a 35 year-old- female. I was an athlete in high school and have been pretty athletic up until about a year ago, when I got very busy. I have been trying to get back in to an exercise routine for a while now and this dvd was perfect. Since I've worked as a massage therapist, I'm very concerned abut safety and proper form. Amy Bento gives thorough explanations of each of the moves. Additionally, it's a great motivator, since you feel a sense of accomplishment after a 20-minute workout (25 minutes if you do the additional stretch.)  If you are just getting back in to exercise, this is perfect. She also includes an intermediate work-out - also 20 minutes. The only move she could explain a bit more thoroughly is the move called ""the clean."" The trick is putting your thumb out , so the bell does not slam in to your wrist. She does this, but she does not actually say it. Here is a demo of ""the clean"" that I found on youtube.[...]  Amy Bento's DVD is produced by Tamilee Webb, who always produces quality and safe work-outs. (She did the Buns of Steel Videos in the 80's) It's also visually appealing compared to the dvd by another company that came with the actual Kettlebell purchase. The music is okay on this one. Not great,  but not too distracting. It would be nice if  there was an 'instructor only' option, so I could play my own music. But, the music is not really a problem.",1263686400,52,1394,4.391472868217054
3739118,3,B001P5YIQQ,"I consider myself a beginner,as I am brand new to kettlebell, but not new to fitness workouts.  I work out daily with many types of workouts (pilates, yoga, dance, cardio, step, etc).  I felt Absolute Beginner would give me what I needed to learn the basics and was interested because it also included an intermediate workout as well.

The cuing is good, she lets you know what you should and should not be doing so that you know proper form,so for that I felt it was worth it.  The tutorial section instructed 6 basic moves and took about 10 minutes.

The beginner portion was about 20 minutes and you practice moves you learned in the tutorial section.

The intermediate portion was also about 20 minutes and I thought might have a bit more moves, but the main difference seemed to be that she added in a bit of extra cardio between the toning moves (such as simulating a jump rope, etc).  Maybe I expected a little more, or maybe I am not quite as beginner as I think I am.

Both workouts end with a two minute stretch that basically stretches the glutes and hip flexors. I was a little surprised that there wasn't a bit more, but then again, the workout is only 20 minutes, so maybe that is about right.

I started with a 7 lb. weight and felt the moves were very easy to follow and I could build up later with a heavier kettlebell as I feel the need.

As far as the instructor, she absolutely knows her stuff, but I can't say I am a huge fan, she is a bit too chatty for my tastes and a little bit over the top on the motivational, ""you can do it"" stuff.

The music was not my idea of great workout music-which unless I'm doing a dance workout should basically just be a little background, not an urban kind of sound with sirens in some spots.  So, musicwise, also, a little over the top.

So, who is this workout for?  I would say those that are fitness beginners (not just kettlebell, but fitness in general), older exercisers (I'm middle aged, so I mean older than that...) or those that have lifted no weights and are starting from the ground, ground floor.

I borrowed this one from the library, and I have decided I would outgrow this much too soon, so will not be purchasing, but if you fall into one of the categories above, this may be just the ticket to start a fitness regime that will work your body, and give you a little cardio from someone who knows the ropes.",1263168000,296,2380,4.304932735426009
3739119,5,B001P5YIQQ,"This video is absolutely the way to start in Kettlebells! She has a training section, a beginners and intermediate section. Her form and moves are right on. I started with five pounds and the first time could only get through one circuit. I am doing better now. It is my third day with this. She also has some stretching after the beginning workout. The intermediate section also includes some cardio. And, of course, I hadn't worked out in a couple of years but feel that this will keep me going. It is fun and short when you are finished you know you have had a workout. I am 69 years old....",1262304000,120,594,4.36036036036036
3739120,5,B001P5YIQQ,This was a Christmas present from my husband. I had tried a few other Kettlebell Dvd's featuring master Kettlebell instructors but felt a little overwhelmed by their magnitude. I was very encouraged with this beginners level by Ms. Bento.  I like her instructions and cueing;she gives you time to catch your breath after power moves or when switching to a new move. I really wanted to learn how to use kettlebells because you don't need alot of space to use them and I needed more variety in my workouts. I learned about this DVD from Prevention mag and am very happy my husband ordered it for me. I am 54 yr old and actively work out 4 times/wk and feel this beginners DVD was right for me.,1261872000,332,691,4.440944881889764

3739132,4,B001P5YIQQ,Pretty good for beginners. Use the style she holds on the cover. Hand placement mattered for some of the moves. Mine are half moon shaped handles you can't really grip from the sides of the handle.,1483142400,,197,4.5

I didn't see much difference between the beginner and intermediate workout as far as difficulty.  Maybe the moves were more complicated with the intermediate workout but they seem pretty even other than that.  Both workouts made me sweat.  I felt like I got a good workout- there was cardio follower by the weights and back to the cardio.  Kept the heart pumping.

I am 71 years old and I am so encouraged that I can actually follow along and enjoy this DVD.",1342569600,,149,4.0
3739310,4,B001P5YIQQ,"I admit it, I find Amy Bento adorable. I have a sneaking suspicion that she's a goofball off camera. You can almost feel the presence of a director, reminding her to give pep talks (""I am WAY proud of you!""). It doesn't feel like that's really her thing, so it makes me giggle every time.

Her form is a little bit off in some of the moves. Not in a put-you-in-traction sort of way (go to Gin Miller for that--I did some serious damage with just 5 lbs with her), but in such a way that you might not be getting as much out of it as you could. I would recommend getting a book (even if just from the library) from someone who is RKC-certified (she now is), like Pavel Tsatsouline or Lauren Brooks or any of the others, just to guide you through the correct form---better yet, a personal training session or two---and then apply those skills to the exercises on this DVD.

If you are Beginner with a capital B, this may scare you a little. Going from couch to her beginner workout is a shock to the system. But, go with it. Take all the time you need to get the form right. Practice the tutorial, over and over, and then GO! You will be surprised how quickly your body figures it out (the human body really does like the kettlebell).

And, have a towel handy. You're going to be sweating. (I wear a cold wrap around my neck, because I have to be careful about how high my body temperature goes up. Works fine.)

UPDATE: When I wrote this review, I had not yet tried the ""Intermediate Workout"" on the disc. For my purposes, I'm not a fan, although for yours, it may work better.

The Intermediate workout levels up in two ways. 1) the addition of cardio between the kettlebell sets; 2) more complicated kettlebell sets.

For me, the cardio that I get from a regular kettlebell workout is plenty. I'm not trying to shed calories, so it is of minimal benefit. One of the things that I love about the kettlebell is how easy it is to adapt to your goals. Need to shed more calories? Add more cardio. Want to get strong? Add weight. Want to do something else? There's an easily incorporated solution.

As for the more complicated ketllebell sets, the moves are the same ones that she did in the tutorial and the beginners workout, but in combination. I don't really like them. For one thing, she kicks up the speed quite a lot, so I spend a lot of my attention just on keeping up, rather than maintaining good form. I actually wrenched my back a bit yesterday, and since burning calories is minimally important to me, I'm not very motivated to get it right.

The other problem for me with the combinations is that the transitions, because they're so quick, end up being really clunky. One of the other things that I love about the kettlebell is the way it flows with your body's natural rhythms. Something about the handle changes your center of gravity in such a way that I feel like I'm working out underwater. These moves squash that, making them feel more like barbells than kettlebells.

I like the Beginners Workout far better than the Intermediate Workout, although I can see how Intermediate might work for someone who is not me.",1338854400,5,3129,4.418402777777778
3739311,5,B001P5YIQQ,This was an absolute perfect video. The video that came with my Kettlebell was ridiculous. Kettlebell is a weight and proper form is required in order to not cause injury during the workout. Ms Bento's instructions were easy to follow and the beginning workout was uncomplicated.  In fact after doing the workout didn't need the video anymore and could take kettlebell to work to do a quick routine.  If you think you know kettlebell then don't get this video.  If you think you know but not sure it's worth the money.  Save you a trip to surgery for shoulder injury like a friend of mine who thought they knew it all about kettlebell!,1333152000,6,635,4.592920353982301

When I did it the first time, it may have been low to no impact, but it made me VERY sore the next day. Although this is a great video, I would take it slow, especially if you're disabled, and not push it too hard. With these kettlebells it's easy to keep going and not realize how hard you're working. But other than that, these are great, and there really is little to no impact. I'm glad I got this, and I'll keep trying to use it, but at a slower pace.",1330300800,10,578,4.034782608695652

Four weeks ago I arrived in Ft. Worth Texas for a work consulting project.  Before arriving I bought a 10 pound kettlebell and Amy Bento's video and challenged myself to faithfully work out 5 days a week, 30 minutes a day.

Today is my 24th day and the results are in:  Lost 13 pounds and a total of 11 inches.  Absolutely amazing.  So amazing I've sent via amazon 10 pound kettlebells and the Amy Bento video to 6 friends and my sister who is stationed in Korea.  I can't think of anything nicer to do for someone you care about.  Most importantly do Amy Bento's workout for yourself!!!!

I am 56 years old, 5'5, 245 pounds. My 28 year old daughter has a solid toned body full of muscle from using the kettlebells and encourgaged me to try it. I have neuropathy, arthritis and fibromylgia so I had my doubts. Surprise! I can do it and I love it!

Amy's beginner workout was an excellent way to start out. She goes slow enough and explains everything every step of the way. The 1st time I tried it I could only get thru the warm up, LOL. But the 2nd time I nailed the beginner workout and I felt so proud. I thought for sure I would be in so much pain by the end of that day or the next day but I wasn't, just a little sore. So now I do the workout every other day.

 After a month I moved up to the intermediate level. At first I just did the kettlebell workout segments and marched in place to the cardio segments. Then one-by-one I began doing the cardio segements as described. After 1 month of using the intermediate workout I feel great and stronger then I have in years! My clothes are getting very lose so I know I'm toning up and losing inches. I have SO much more energy and flexability. I can't praise Amy enough. This DVD was worth 10 times what I paid for it.

3739334,4,B001P5YIQQ,"I think this is a good video if you're new to fitness or kettlebells. One reviewer mentioned that she did other types of workouts and thought this was very beginner. I agree, I believe this is for someone who has never really worked out before and wants to try kettlebells. I'm not a fitness maverick or anything, but I would say this is extremly basic. I was a little bit disappointed because after viewing some stuff on youtube I thought it would be a little more dynamic. This kind of seems like you could just use a hand weight if you didn't have a kettlebell.

She does explain basic things like cleans and catches. I just think if you're very overweight like more than 250lbs this would be a good dvd to start with. I am also very overweight, but I used to be very active I think that's why this video was a little too slow for me. If you're in good shape I would suggest getting another video because this wouldn't really do much for you. I feel that this is mostly a tutorial video. The intermediate section was just adding more cardio type moves instead of more difficult kettlebell manuvers so I wouldn't say it was that intermediate in terms of kettlebell moves.

I believe you should get this video if you're older, (in your 60's) and in not good shape or extremely overweight and need somewhere to begin. I think that this video is too easy for people in good shape or people who work out reguarly with other methods. If you want to challenge yourself this is not the video to do it with. I think more advanced people would be bored with this. I will use it because I am overweight and I need something to get me started however in about a month I will be moving onto another video because this is not that challenging.",1312070400,6,1732,4.359133126934984

3739338,4,B001P5YIQQ,"Well the name says it all, so if you're disappointed in this video for lack of gusto, you shouldn't be. The tutorial, two workouts, and stretching portion are  designed to simply get you started with handling a kettlebell, and working it in a very basic way. You learn several different and fundamental routines that help you get familiar with working a kettlebell in the ""Beginners"" portion of the DVD, and the ""Intermediate"" portion combines these moves to give you an idea of where you can go with all this kettlebell business. The tutorial is nice and explains the very basic principles of working out with kettlebells, and everything is easy to understand and follow.

The workouts themselves are not very rigorous after doing them for a week or so, and I actually find the beginners routine to be more so. They are decent lite workouts that will get the heart rate up and the blood pumping well, however. The instruction from the trainer is fine, and she is personable and motivational. This is a very basic introduction to kettlebell workouts and fundamental kettlebell moves. It involves easy to do routines for the ""Absolute Beginner,"" as the title says. If that is you like it was me, I would highly recommend it to get familiar with kettlebells. Where you go from there, who knows? And if you already lift weights and cardio regularly and think you're up to the challenge of something more advanced right off the bat, I would suggest Amy Bento's ""Kettlebell Dynamics"" DVD. However, if you have never worked with kettlebelss before you will still need to hug a learning curve. This video, ""Absolute Beginners,"" gets you very well acquainted with that initial curve.",1300924800,16,1675,4.853146853146853
3739339,4,B001P5YIQQ,"I am definitely not a fitness freak and am just starting to get back into exercise. This is a good video for people like myself. I was sore after my first workout. Beginners do need to be wary of Amy Bento's tendency to pulse and bounce during her routine. Scientific research has shown this is damaging to joints. As long as you know not to do this, this is a good beginners workout. You can add more weight and you progress.",1300060800,4,426,4.271604938271605
3739340,2,B001P5YIQQ,"Another ""jump on the kettlebell bandwagon"" knockoff. In this DVD, Amy Bento has clearly not studied with anyone who is trained in Russian kettlebells, as she uses the ARMS (?!) for the kettlebell swing, which is totally wrong. (The hips drive the swing, with almost zero effort from the arms.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: Amy has (since?) become RKC certified, and her form has *dramatically* improved from this video. In this DVD, however, her form is not correct, though she does have a few good points, such as the squat position she demonstrates.

To see Amy performing true RKC form, check out her later DVD ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amy-Bento-Ross-Kettlebell-Power-DVD/dp/B005HW2VP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amy Bento Ross: Kettlebell Power DVD</a>"", available here on Amazon. A clip is available via Amy's website, which shows her vastly improved form.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

She also bends at the wrist during the cleans/presses, which is a huge no-no, especially as the weight increases. Nothing is said about footwear -- she's wearing running shoes, another huge no-no (bare feet or flat Converses should be used, or martial arts shoes), and a few other points like making sure the shoulder remains down (""packed"") are overlooked.

Some points are okay, but this is one of those rah-rah! DVDs I personally can't stand. The music sounds like a bad porn movie, and yes, as one reviewer pointed out, Amy's ""yeah, can you feel the burn? Give it to me..."" only adds to the sleaze effect.

To top it off, the kettlebell Amy is using is too light even for a five-year-old. You won't get much workout from it, and you certainly won't understand what kettlebells are about, using such a light weight. Average women start with 18lbs; strong women start with 26 lbs. Amy is probably using 5lbs. (Google ""Aaron Pierson"" or NorthernColoradoKettlebell blog to see Aaron's 6-yr-old doing the kettlebell swing with a 10lb bell.) Believe me, your technique will change with a heavier weight.

Please, do yourself a favor and find a DVD by an RKC or HKC certified trainer like Lauren Brooks or Andrea Du Cane -- EDIT: Or Amy's later DVDs after she became RKC certified. Learn proper technique, and you will see *amazing* results...but NOT with this DVD.

(I've lost 12 lbs in 1 month using Lauren's Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning Vol 1 DVD, without changing my diet other than craving healthier foods rather than junk. Easy peasy!)",1299801600,43,2613,5.583333333333333
3739341,4,B001P5YIQQ,I bought this DVD after reading all of the great reviews from Amazon customers. Amy has great energy and gives you proper instruction on working with kettlebells during exercises. I definitely recommend this DVD for first time kettlebell users like myself.,1298505600,4,256,5.2682926829268295
3739342,1,B001P5YIQQ,"This video is one of those fusion numbers and not at all like traditional interval type Kettlebell workouts. I found the instruction unsettling, as the instructor flirts. ""Oh yeah, feel that burn? Give it to me, Give me five more!!"", all while maintaining a creepy degree of eye contact with the camera. This type of thing doesn't usually bother me, I realize the instructor is trying to motivate you but this goes beyond that. Also, the instructor's technique is all about the High Impact Aerobics. Grapevine, anyone? The music is quite bad (all synthesizer fuzziness)and Amy's incessant 5-6-7-8 counting got right on my nerves. But, I do have to give her points for enthusiasm. She was really excited to be there, even if I was not. If you're a fan of the early 1990's cartilage burners, this one's for you! If your looking for a serious kettlebell workout video, look elsewhere!",1296691200,17,881,4.841059602649007
3739343,4,B001P5YIQQ,"** Kettle bells work! **  Revised 05/12/11, I still hate my kettle bell. I hate it when I realize it's kettle bell workout day. I'm sore not for days now but just a day after using my kettle bell in places I didn't even know that I had muscles! Going up stairs is torture after using your KB. So, after that rousing endorsement, let me say this is my second DVD as the first one, the Go Fit workout, is far too hard. Amy's style is easy, clear and has enough breaks in the action to let you catch your breath. I now like to switch off between the beginning and intermediate workout. Some days, I find the ""easier"" program harder if I haven't done it in a couple of weeks. One thing I've noticed is that one really gets better at the moves, which are simple but you can feel your hip snaps and thrusts really working. ** I've taken off an inch from my mama belly **",1290556800,71,864,4.112426035502959
3739344,3,B001P5YIQQ,"The video is definitely for beginners, however, if you are experienced in using weights this may be a bit slow. I found the instructions boring and not well thought out especially the intermediate cardio intervals.  I rated the video 'OK' (3 stars) because it does teach the basic exercises at a beginners' pace.  To improve this video, I would suggest longer exercise intervals, more exercises with the bell, advice the audience what part of the body their working, and the instructor should  consider including another person to break the ice - she just seemed uncomfortable at times.

8332173,5,B001P5YIQQ,"The tutorial could benefit from more clear instruction (do's and dont's) of how to use the proper form to prevent injury. If you're not at all familiar with safe and proper form for lifting weights, squats, etc., please go online and do some research first. Aside from that, I find the beginning workout to be my #1 go to high intensity interval training (HIIT) 20-min workout. I am 45, 6'1"" 180 lbs and I make a point to exercise daily, but sometimes it is hard to find the time to get strength, cardio, and flexibility into a single workout. But, the beginning workout does it all and I break into a good sweat in 20 minutes. After getting to know the routine, I can put a podcast on in the background and learn something new while doing a 20 min HIIT workout. When I'm short on time, but want to keep my exercise streak going or get my heart rate pumping before a longer cardio session, this is my go to workout.",1528070400,,915,4.325581395348837

8332180,4,B001P5YIQQ,"I want to save beginners some unnecessary pain, because if you go with the ""squat and snap the hips forward"" you might hurt your lower back. Instead think more about driving your heels into the floor and squeezing the glutes to generate the energy to move the bell forward. And ignore her feet. WTBS...if you do your research on kettlebell safety and technique elsewhere AND you are a beginner the workout itself is a good one. Amy Bento is encouraging without that annoying overperkiness some lady trainers have. The music is not all that great, but it's mostly in the background and provides just enough to keep you in tempo. If you are a kettlebell beginner like me and love it but sometimes struggle with lower back pain (and again research safe technique particularly for the swinging moves) then this is a great workout. The exercises them self are challenging but doable. The trainer is encouraging, but don't rely on the tutorial to teach technique. I'd recommend Ultimate Kettlebell Workouts for Beginners to learn the swing.",1488585600,6,1034,4.880681818181818

8332182,5,B001P5YIQQ,"I am over 40 years old and have FSH muscular dystrophy which affects mostly upper body muscles. I wanted to try the kettlebell to build some endurance and get back into an exercise routine, and tried 2 DVDs. NOTE: I used 3 pound hand weights to see if I could do the exercises before purchasing a kettlebell.
1. Kettlebell 3-in-1 with Amy Bento. HIGHLY recommend for beginners, or people not currently exercising. She has an advanced segment, that Im not sure if I can do, but the intro and beg. Workout was awesome! I was sweating and able to do the exercises. She explains things good. She also does 3 reps of everything, so you know what to expect. Only downfall (if any) is I don't think her sense of humor is all that great. Shes a little dry, but the music is good and its exactly what I need. Amy also shows how you can modify an exercise for more basic/more advanced people which is very helpful! I have bad knees, and this didn't bother my knees.
2. Ultimate Kettlebell workout for Beginners with Paul Katami. I would consider this workout INTERMEDIATE! He does shoulder things I cant do because I have a degenerated trapezius muscle. He does TONS of squats and lunges which bothered my knees. I am a person with knee problems, so Im not surprised. Paul is a wonderful instructor and has a great sense of humor/interesting to listen to and watch. This DVD is NOT for me, but thats because of my health issues and this NOT being a good fit for me. Overall, well done. He looks like a professional runner, and incorporates running into the cardiovascular which I cannot do. I know how to alter to marching or one leg side ways jumping jacks, but he gave no alternatives.",1485734400,,1677,4.483660130718954
