4386689,3,B004IK30SM,"My 3 stars is for this package and not for the movies themselves which I would rate at 5 stars.  I would have preferred to get Star Trek I and II in the same box then II and IV (random).  That would have been more ""logical"" to quote Spoke.  :=)  I'm having a hard time getting Star Trek I (The Motion Picture).  It seems they are trying to cover up that one.  The Wrath of Khan is my favorite, but you might as well purchase the individual bluray with all the bonus features for that.",1307664000,4,484,4.042105263157895
4386690,1,B004IK30SM,"Imagine my surprise seeing these two films bundled together on Blu-ray at an unbelievable price! I would have to agree with the other reviewers of the Blu-ray versions that both films seem to have a soft focus and lack in sharpness. I was hoping that Blu-ray would be the ultimate viewing experience but it isn't - yet (I'm hoping for a new issue that fixes this problem in the future). For now, you are better off just seeing the standard definition DVDs of these 2 films upconverted to 1080p.",1306195200,12,494,4.561797752808989
4386691,5,B004IK30SM,"This is just the two Blu-ray discs shrinkwrapped together with new cover. It's cheaper than buying the discs separately, so it's a great deal. (I haven't watched them yet, but based on the Amazon reviews for the separate discs and the cost savings from the combined package I'm giving it 5 stars. And of course these are the two best Trek movies.)",1305158400,4,347,4.612903225806452

8430724,5,B004IK30SM,"Bought this for a friend's birthday. Here's the thing: Star Trek's 1 and 3 are BORING! 2 and 4 are GREAT, which is why they put together this little package. That's all I have to say except KHAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN!",1475107200,,211,4.578947368421052
8430725,5,B004IK30SM,I am an original Trekkie from 1968 and still love to watch Star Trek movies.  I especially love this one with Khan and the very funny Voyage Home.  In my heart no new actors can replace the original cast.  These 2 movies are my favorites.  Great purchase.,1472169600,,255,4.361702127659575
8430726,5,B004IK30SM,"I was in front of a tiny TV with rabbit ears on September 8, 1966 to watch the very first episode of ""Star Trek.""  The episode was called ""The Man Trap"" about a creature with suction cups on its hands that ""feeds"" on the salt from the bodies of its prey.  I was immediately hooked and I've enjoyed watching every ""Star Trek"", and all of its spinoffs, and all of the movies many times over.  In my opinion, ""Star Trek"" II and IV represent the very best in the illustrious series.",1453420800,,478,4.230769230769231

8430729,5,B004IK30SM,"These are perhaps the two best Star Trek films, and getting the pair on blu-ray for $7 is a steal. ""Wrath of Khan"" is exciting and intense, and ""Voyage Home"" is quite comical and gay. There are lots of amusing scenes and lines in the latter, including Spock's attempts at 1980s bad language: ""Well, a double-dumb-'donkey' on you!"" (Spock uses the shorter word for ""donkey"" of course, but not to worry, the film is PG, and there isn't any real bad language.)

Even if you're not a trekkie / trekker, but just a casual fan of Star Trek or science fiction, these are two well-executed, fun films. The blu-ray picture looks just fine to me, though it's nothing spectacular (unlike the stunning ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" blu-rays, for examples). For less than $10, though, what's to complain about?",1402963200,2,818,4.76056338028169
8430730,5,B004IK30SM,These films are two of Star Trek : the original crew's best. Capt. Kirk and the gang will always be my movie all-time favorites .,1393200000,,129,4.2
8430731,5,B004IK30SM,"I was confused by some of the reviews, this arrived as two, individually cased discs, Blu-Ray, with extra features, etc., and plays well.  In short, what I would have expected of any DVD purchase, neither more nor less.  These are my two favorite features from the original Sta Trek film series and these discs do them clear, sharp-color justice.  I am very happy with my purchase of this combo.  ""Wrath of Khan"" has a nice tribute to Ricardo Montalban.",1369785600,2,453,4.69620253164557
