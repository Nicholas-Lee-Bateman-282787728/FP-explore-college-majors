8671987,4,B00MFVHO24,I bought this just because Aneurin Barnard was in it and found this movie to be entertaining. I had no idea who Cilla was but I do now and I was glad to watch her story unfold.,1500422400,,176,3.7837837837837838
8671988,5,B00MFVHO24,"I generally review Region One (US) DVDs here on Amazon but I just cought this teriffic 3 part series made for the commercial British ITV television network on the Acorn TV website. Each of the 3 episodes runs 46 minutes (because there are no commercials) and It's terrific. I'm old enough to have been a Cilla Black fan in 1962. I loved the bBriish Girl singers. Cilla (whose born surname was White - you'll find out how it became ""Black"" by watching the film.
Sheridan Smith - the actress playing Cilla does all the singing.  The real life Cilla died last year

Nowe, here is the Bad news. Though it is abailable in the NON-US PAL format on DVD, it will NOT be available on the NTSC format for US release. This was confirmed by the folks at Acorn. The royaly fees for the music included - lots of Lennon and McCartney songs as well as other British  hits - is way too pricey. The cost to license for a stream is less than a physical release.

So, if you have a region free player, I recommend the DVD - otherwise use Acorn on Line to catch it.
I hope you found this review  both informative and helpful.

8671992,5,B00MFVHO24,"I have been a fan of Cilla's for years despite the fact that I grew up in the US and that she was not as visible here as she was in the UK. I heard about this miniseries in 2014 and I was lucky to be able to watch it on You Tube but I knew I wanted to own it. I inquired if it would ever be available in Region 1 format and was told no. It was then I decided to get an all region DVD player and I ordered ""Cilla"". Sheridan Smith is wonderful in it and I'm glad Cilla lived long enough to see what a great job she did. I highly recommend this DVD for any Cilla fans or fans of ""British Invasion"" music.",1456790400,2,601,3.6666666666666665
8671993,5,B00MFVHO24,"Exceptionally good three episode tv miniseries made in 2014, with Sheriden Smith beautifully playing Cilla Black - and she can sing as a well as her also! A lot for Britpop and Beatles fans as well explaining the Liverpool scene and music in the early 60's that captured the worlds imagination, and still does. We see Cilla Black's amateur days at the Cavern Club where she worked as a cloakroom girl, her romance with Bobby (who she was to happily marry), her struggles to be successful as a singer then the breakthrough recording with a number one record. The scene where she and Bobby get the news of that ( a Liverpool telephone box) is very touching and memorable. And quite a bit more of Cilla Black's life after that as well. She seemed to become very single minded about her singing career and maybe lost some of her girlish charm on the way, but became something of a national institution in the UK, with a long tv career, and her songs are still greatly loved and admired.

It's an astonishingly good piece of television, well cast, well written, well filmed and well acted.",1451260800,,1084,4.587628865979381
8671994,5,B00MFVHO24,"Sheridan Smith nails Cilla Black in this 3 episode TV biopic charting the Sixties Pop Queens rise to fame and fortune. While not achieving exactitude in her vocal renditions of the songs that took Cilla to the top of the charts, Smiths performances, nonetheless, are magically evocative of that time in the lives of millions who grew up in a period before non-stop music was readily on tap and the Internet literally a pipe-dream!

The four famous mop tops and various other Mersey Beat wannabees make appearances now and again and its interesting to note the debt that Cilla owed to the Beatles in firmly establishing her career: from introducing her to Brian Epstein to penning a couple of her early hits.

The whole cast are brilliant but both Aneurin Barnard (Bobby Willis) and Ed Stoppard (Brian Epstein) deserve special mentions for capturing the spirits of their respective characters. Both men saw and heard that embryonic something special in Cilla and the series skilfully illustrates how she used and discarded both at various times to serve her own ends: perhaps all successful individuals, however talented, need that ruthless self-serving streak to make it in such a fickle and cut-throat business.

Anyone, who grew up during those times will be sure to love this and it may also serve to introduce possibly baffled younger generations to the special enchantment that made the Sixties such a magical time.",1427587200,4,1420,5.008474576271187
