7947099,4,B00005NG0I,"A wonderful compilation of espionage movies and some TV shows, with a generous collection of clips and a few rarer entries. My only quibble is a section dealing with James Bond parodies that neglects any mention of ""Get Smart."" Also, there's no mention of either ""Danger Man"" or ""The Prisoner,"" which seems particularly egregious. Aside from this these shameful omissions, this ia a worthwhile purchase for any secret agent fan.",999648000,5,428,5.128571428571429
