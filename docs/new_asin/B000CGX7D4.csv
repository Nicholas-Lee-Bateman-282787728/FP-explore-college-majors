8098960,1,B000CGX7D4,"There is no depth to the interviews. I bought this dvd thinking that I could learn something from it, but there is nothing there. It is very superficial and flat in all perspectives, placement of the subjects, editing and text.",1163030400,,227,4.7
8098961,5,B000CGX7D4,Mr. Mukherji's unobtrusive direction and hosting styles allow us to sit back and truly listen to these four intriguing hosts. A truly stylish and thought provoking journey. I loved it!,1042675200,2,184,5.166666666666667

8098963,5,B000CGX7D4,"This is marvelous documentary. One the best interview movies I've seen. An excellent and insightful film about five American Storytellers if you include the silent host who is also the filmmaker. It's refreshing to see a documentary film where the host is confident enough to let the subjects speak their mind and finish their sentences without interrupting sound bites or photographs. Director Kevin Mukherji makes an interesting comment about the importance of listening, as further pointed out by Harold Ramis. Interesting also is the method discussed by these film makers, not only about making films but also the differences between studio and independent films. How they got started and what motivates them to ""StoryTelling"". Maybe in American Storytellers 2 we can find out more about the silent host/storyteller.",1041897600,5,820,5.4140625
