2165374,2,B000640N5W,"A Cannon production with Roger Moore, count me in! What I got was a bad episode of an 80's television show. I was looking forward to seeing Moore outside the role of James Bond but this fell flat on its face. Just a slow thriller that is uninteresting and with some extremely outdated views on psychiatry. I would rate this several notches below ""A View to A Kill"" (Moore's worst Bond film in my opinion). The highlights of this film is Rod Steiger playing a detective that is really over the top and a supporting role by Elliot Gould. Gould's part isn't great, it's just nice to see the guy in a movie. I would recommend this film on only if you are a big Rod Steiger fan, and that means you like the good and the bad. The quality of the Blu-Ray is good, picture and sound are great, Kino Lorber is doing a great job with their Blu-rays.",1417305600,3,838,4.24375
2165375,2,B000640N5W,"When The Naked Face finally emerged from years of development hell at various studios in 1984 it was regarded as a major stinker, but with the passage of time it seems more of a mediocrity and another prime example of Cannon's sporadic attempts to go a bit upmarket with a decent cast and director and come up with considerably less than the sum of its parts. The last big-screen credit for writer-director Bryan Forbes, who'd gone from one of the most important figures in the post-war British film industry to being regarded as something of an outdated running joke by that time, it's a flat adaptation of a Sidney Sheldon thriller about an upmarket psychiatrist (Roger Moore) who suddenly finds himself the target of killer or killers unknown and regarded by the cop on the case (Rod Steiger, dialling it down but looking disarmingly like Ernie Wise) as the chief suspect in the murder of the various innocent parties who keep on getting killed instead of him. Naturally the motive is a secret he doesn't know but the script just hits plot points without making things especially interesting or providing much in the way of doubt or viable suspects while the direction never conjures up any atmosphere or thrills. Worse, it all ends with an Irving the Explainer finale where the killer jeopardises his chance to finally polish off the good doctor by spending ages pontificating allegorically and filling in plot details in horribly on the nose dialogue a world away from the naturalistic speech patterns that made Forbes' name in the British film industry a quarter of a century earlier.

It doesn't help that parts of the film have that typical rather cheap look of so many Cannon films despite the star casting - Elliot Gould underplaying it as good cop to Steiger's bad cop, Art Carney as a down-at-heel ageing P.I. and Anne Archer among the patients. A better actor than even he gave himself credit for, Moore had delivered perhaps his best performance 14 years earlier in The Man Who Haunted Himself which was co-written by Forbes and you suspect he was hoping that lightning would strike twice, but here he's decent but far from outstanding in a part that almost certainly appealed because it's the antithesis of 007, barely able to throw a punch and having to call in the cavalry to save him rather than dealing with the killers himself. The kind of film that plays better on the small screen than it did on the big, it's the cinematic equivalent of wallpaper and all too understandable why this is one of the least remembered entries on his filmography.

The German DVD and region-free Blu-ray offers a scrubbed up widescreen transfer with English and German soundtrack options, with US trailer and stills gallery as extras.",1403136000,7,2735,4.817021276595745

2165377,5,B000640N5W,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it offered both good acting and suspense.  If you want a movie with good acting, suspense plus a surprise ending, this is the one.",1371427200,2,170,4.666666666666667
2165378,4,B000640N5W,"I never really liked Roger Moore; he was too sickly sweet, however, there are two very good movies he did that appealed to me.  This is a fine mystery that's hard to figure out until you're well into the movie.  Rod Steiger, the man you love to hate in so many of his roles, is quite good in getting you to hate him early on, but be patient.  The other movie of Moore's that I have to mention is ffolkes.  In it he finally portrays ""a real man,"" admittedly with a few hang-ups, but a man worthy of both respect and a healthy amount of fear by his enemies and his friends come to think of it.",1355270400,,591,4.0256410256410255
2165379,5,B000640N5W,"I normally do not enjoy this type of movie because I find following plot twists mentally tiring, when what I wanted was light entertainment. But this one held my attention from start to finish, largely due to the unusual script and to Moore's acting, which is superb here. Anne Archer, Elliot Gould, Art Carney and Rod Steiger are also very good.",1135468800,8,346,4.688524590163935
2165380,1,B000640N5W,"I was expecting a James Bond 007 movie and got a poor made movie of Roger Moore.  I think it needs to be removed from the James Bond category.  Roger Moore was the worst James Bond and I didn't want a ""B"" movie that Roger Moore made when I was ordering the James Bond 007 series type movies.",1132963200,3,291,4.0

8038158,4,B000640N5W,"The Naked Face, 1984 film

A man in a car points a rifle at a mourner in a cemetery. But hearses arrive to block his aim. This psychoanalyst treats a patient, then lends him his raincoat. Later this man is stabbed on a sidewalk! The police investigate, they find this Doctors secretary stabbed dead in his office! Lt. McGreevy met Doctor Stevens before, there is a personality conflict because of Dr. Stevens testimony about an insane murderer. Detective Angelee is more professional. Doctor Hadley is a witness to the phony doormen who tried to kill Dr. Stevens; a bullet in the wall is proof. Dr. Stevens wife was killed in a traffic accident, her wealth went to her brother. Dr. Stevens hires Morgans, a private detective, who finds a bomb in the Stevens car! Those two men say it was not a lone maniac. Detective Angelee cautions Dr. Stevens and tells him to be more cautious.

Morgans calls Dr. Stevens and asks for a private meeting at a lonely pier. Det. Angelee goes along. Morgans won't talk to them! The police will follow Dr. Stevens day and night now. Who is Don Vincent? Dr. Stevens learns the meaning, and is taken to a safe house. He meets the husband of one of his patients! Will he betray a clients confidentiality? She didn't say anything. Dr. Stevens doesnt understand this, he is taken for a ride. Will help arrive in time? The police are notified. Don Vincent speaks philosophically about human nature. A liability must be eliminated for the good of the group. Dr. Stevens makes a run but is caught. Then a shot rings out, and then more! Lt. McGreevy arrives with help to stop the games. There is another procession of hearses at a cemetery. A long woman walks to meet Dr. Stevens. Are you alright now? Dr. Stevens is now semi-retired, he is writing a book on the criminal mind. Is everything alright? A shot rings out, a body falls. Is this the end of the story? A hell of a way to treat a taxpayer.

This is a good suspense mystery story with some surprises. The book by Sidney Sheldon must have had more details. Eric Ambler wrote novels where a man works at his job but suddenly finds himself in mortal danger. Learning the truth about a friend is always dramatic. Would a doctor take a patient without knowing anything about his or her background or identification? Suppose that woman was married to a high government official and knew about their dirty tricks? Could she die in an accident? Would this improve this story? The Hippocratic Oath requires physicians to maintain client confidentiality, it is for their own good. There is one funny scene where Dr. Stevens says he doesnt believe in guns and Morgans replies with a joke.",1434153600,,2658,4.61522198731501
