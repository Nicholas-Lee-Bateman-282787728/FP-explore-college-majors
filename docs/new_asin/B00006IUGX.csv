7969393,3,B00006IUGX,"I did not find this as nice as I thought, as the scenes don't change as often as you would like.  I find it more interesting if the scenes are constantly random, but with this video you are seeing the same scene for minutes.  The music is not bad.",1359590400,,247,4.020408163265306

7969395,5,B00006IUGX,I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this dvd.  This a good dvd.  The natural sounds and the music have a good balance throughout the dvd.  You have several option selections on how you may want to loop the video.,1193184000,,222,4.238095238095238
