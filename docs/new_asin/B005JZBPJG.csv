8476253,5,B005JZBPJG,"Bought this just for the movie 'Playing by Heart'.  Great ensemble cast, I will never understand why it was not more popular when it came out.  Lack of violence and car chases may have something to do with it.  I can tell you nothing about the other 2 movies, sorry.",1395878400,,266,4.28
8476254,5,B005JZBPJG,I enjoyed Four Rooms and 2 other movies in this package. Jennifer Beals was wonderful in Four Rooms. She should of had more of  a greater role.,1394236800,,143,4.296296296296297
8476255,3,B005JZBPJG,"I love Playing By Heart & Four Rooms so I purchased this DVD thinking the other two films would become favorites too. I couldn't even get through Full Frontal, I was bored to tears; Beautiful Girls was tolerable only because Rosy ODonnell was hilarious & made it bearable to get thru.",1362873600,2,284,4.588235294117647
