8575984,4,B0056CQEEI,"This is a great show from what I've seen so far if you're into fan service, which is why I bought it. It seems like the story could be interesting from what I saw as well though. The reason I say ""could"" is this version is in Japanese only, no subtitles. I still enjoyed it as I'm an avid anime viewer and I kinda can tell what is generally going on in certain situations by the way it's animated and the character reactions. The only part I wish were more clear before making this purchase is that it was only episodes 1-3. I thought I was getting a used copy of all twelve. The disk and case itself are in 100% mint condition though. Only other drawback is it took almost a month to arrive.",1524787200,,692,4.133333333333334
