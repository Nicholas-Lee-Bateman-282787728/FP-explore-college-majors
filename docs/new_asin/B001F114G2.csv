8300529,5,B001F114G2,One of the best movies I've seen.  Definitely keeps you guessing!,1514073600,,65,4.909090909090909
8300530,3,B001F114G2,"The good: the acting, the actors, some quirkiness.  The bad: awkward, woefully predictable, can see what's coming from the start of the movie.  I made the big mistake of purchasing before viewing- since I love David Stratthairn, and reincarnation/ love across time is one of my favorite themes, I thought I couldn't miss.  I was wrong.  Low budget, poorly directed, painfully obvious.  For a thoughtful, subtle, yet thrilling love across time film that's heads and shoulders above this one, a movie I get more from with each viewing, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lake-House/dp/B000K8EQ5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lake House</a>.",1475798400,,696,6.28421052631579
8300531,3,B001F114G2,"I think I like this movie. It's quirky... odd... strange..... perplexing ..... funny? .... interesting...
It's surely not what I thought it was going to be. This is not high budget Hollywood drama. This is like .... a ""made for tv movie"". It's not bad. In fact it was very surprising at the end to find out what actually happened. I guess I like it. It's good. Not great. Good.  :)",1451779200,,381,4.366197183098592
8300532,5,B001F114G2,"Melissa Leo is a brilliant actress, and the chemistry with her equally brilliant co-star David Strathairn is pitch perfect in this romantic gem. Part romance, part mystery, and part small-town Americana, this indie film is well worth seeing. The closing line alone is one of the most romantic lines I've ever heard in a movie.",1410307200,,326,4.945454545454545
8300533,5,B001F114G2,"This movie is an interesting love story. It's atypical and unpredictable. The main character, Sadie, is a little off stride with normal behavior and has memories of her loves from the Civil War era. The other people are quite similar to their ancestors from the Civil War era as well. The lives and times of the past and present intersect occasionally and help connect the dots for this complex story. The movie grows on you the more you see it.",1382918400,2,445,4.575
8300534,5,B001F114G2,"May seem a little slow at first, if you're used to ""typical"" movies, but worth sticking with it till the end. All performances were superior, with simple, understated delivery of monologues, which some people may find flat or boring compared to conventional movies, but which works perfectly considering that the director/writer wants us to feel that these are very ordinary people, living through some strange events which interrupt their ordinary lives; I can't say anything bad about any of the actors performances, i was impressed by all of them by the end, and I don't impress easily.
 A small scale production, more like a play than a film, gorgeous scenery, and these days I'm SO GRATEFUL for any movie that doesn't rely on nauseating herky-jerky handheld camera work to disguise lack-of-action and lack-of-plot, so special-thanks to the filmmakers for keeping that camera still.
The script is slow moving and quiet, but quirky and fun throughout, told in three segments, and absolutely worth sticking with til the end where David Strathairn absolutely runs away with the film, delivering a hilarious denouement that ties together and solves the mysteries and unanswered questions presented in the first two-thirds of the film.
Many people who are expecting a conventional modern movie experience will probably hate it, it's definitely not going to appeal to everyone, but personally, I LOVED IT, I LOVED IT, I LOVED IT.",1372291200,3,1427,5.177489177489178
8300535,5,B001F114G2,"At first when I saw this movie, the open credits annoyed me. A scratchy violin playing was driving me nuts. And then the movie began with what seemed like B movie appearance, but then I got into it. It was well written, well directed, and wonderfully acted. I wish it was a book - I would love to read it. Its a movie to watch over again and enjoy knowing what it's about and where it's going. I would recommend to anyone who likes well thought out and deeply moving movies.",1370131200,3,474,4.21978021978022
8300536,5,B001F114G2,"This movie gets better each time I watch it. The story is exceptional, it's well acted by each actor- no matter how small their role. Racing Daylight encourages us that some loves are timeless.",1365811200,3,193,4.705882352941177
8300537,1,B001F114G2,I am definately a movie person. I can enjoy all kinds of movies. This movie however I did not enjoy. I purchaed it because of the actress melissa leo. I wanted to give it a try and now i wish I had saved my money. The movies was very slow and borring to me. I did not care for the story line and there was no chemistry between these actors at all. As for the actors performence they were good. Im wondering what this movie has done for their careers.,1316044800,,450,4.011111111111111
8300538,5,B001F114G2,"I've watched this movie repeatedly with great enjoyment -- and it gets better each watching.  Part ghost story, part period piece, part comic character study, Nicole Quinn's offbeat love story about two souls that keep connecting in the past and present.  Both Melissa Leo and David Strathairn are terrific in complex, detailed, and ultimately charming roles.  It's a chick flick that men enjoy, too.",1230422400,11,400,5.21875
