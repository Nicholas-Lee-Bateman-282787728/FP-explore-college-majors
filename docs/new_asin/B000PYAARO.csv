8325613,5,B000PYAARO,"Great DVD , very funny stuff. Shows a lot of history and documents Mr Oliver's life as a ventriloquist and historical information of other ventriloquists.
Regarding that review by Robert Lilly.
Mr. Lilly may possibly be off his medication? , Or maybe he just likes to bash stuff he doesn't understand. None of this was shot in a nursing home, but the ""live portions"" were from Mr Oliver's first year on a showboat in Branson MO. and there is plenty of doggie performance time as well as dummies and audience participation.
This is a 15 year old DVD, is out of print and is NOT the new current DVD on Television and for sale.",1402617600,,624,4.482456140350878
8325614,1,B000PYAARO,he has a good act to see. But this dvd was obviously shot by an amature using a hand held camcorder. Shot mostly in old nursing homes. The dogs (best part of his act) are only on cam a few minutes. The rest of his act was boring.,1396051200,,229,3.7916666666666665
