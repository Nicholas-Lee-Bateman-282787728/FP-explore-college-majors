I wanted to be healthy and not gain excess pounds! I started video about 6months into pregnancy as I was still jogging up to then and other forms of exercise. I walked 4-6 miles a day as well as doing this video and made sensible choices on what I ate! lets put it this way, I worn my pre-pregnancy clothes on the way home from the hospital! 7yrs later I used the video again with the same results, total thumbs up! I also used the post-pregnancy workout for the first month or so!",1363564800,,623,4.243697478991597
