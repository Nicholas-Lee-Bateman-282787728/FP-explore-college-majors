204760,5,1938948289,"For most of the last 100 years, the US has thrown money at the problem of poverty. And yet the problem of poverty around the world goes mostly unchanged.  Poverty Cure brings a refreshing and pragmatic approach to addressing the problem of poverty.  Instead of focusing on the causes of poverty, Poverty Cure focuses on the causes of wealth and how to introduce those causes of wealth into areas stricken by poverty.  I would recommend the Poverty Cure DVD series to anyone who is concerned about people suffering from poverty and anyone who realizes that taking the same approach that we have taken for the last 100 years is only going to produce the same results.",1360627200,2,665,4.7155172413793105
204761,5,1938948289,"This series is sure to become a staple for small groups seeking how to better help poor communities in real ways. This should be a prerequisite for any NGO, missions group or aid organization before they try to ""help"".",1358121600,3,218,4.615384615384615
204762,5,1938948289,"I'm tempted to say things about this series like: Its #Mindblowinglyawesome #giveittoeveryoneyouknow
But I'll hold back.
It is incredible and allows the viewer to recognize how they (or we) often view the poor and enables us to see the creative potential of individuals to build community. It is a timely piece that viewers of all ages will value. It inspires the viewer's own creative potential to make a difference in his/her own community and enable discernment on how to most effectively make an impact.

It's the entrepreneur from Kenya, Brazil and Indonesia who knows the true cure to poverty, not just the economist from the US, Switzerland, or Japan.

204765,5,1938948289,"Having spent the past ten years focused on mobilizing people to engage with those living in poverty, I have never been more encouraged by the amount of energy seen in the 20 something generation.  Key to it producing the fruit that we all desire is right thinking resulting in tried and true application, much of what has been absent in generations past.  I have found no better tool for understanding the `why' and the `how' than the PovertyCure.  It is a must see and must share for those who desire to make a significant impact.

204766,5,1938948289,"When we see images of poverty, our hearts fill with compassion. We want to help, but we know that too often our help actually causes harm. Challenging us to connect our hearts and minds, the PovertyCure series empowers us to truly tackle the challenges of poverty and to discover the beauty of transitioning from aid to enterprise.

204767,5,1938948289,"How do we solve poverty in our lifetimes? Perhaps if we just sent more direct aid to those who need it, we could make strides toward wiping out poverty. But trillions of dollars in aid has resulted in little real progress over the last several decades. What we need today is a new paradigm for fighting poverty. A paradigm rooted in the ideas and practices that releases the poor from their circumstances. PovertyCure leads the way in teaching leaders and aid organizations how to design, implement, and measure real poverty solutions. As the CEO of an organization that uses aid as one way to alleviate poverty, I am excited to use the PovertyCure principles with our staff in nine countries. The principles of economic empowerment and local ownership have the power to transform a generation currently stuck in poverty--and partly kept there because we have continued to promote aid instead of true poverty solutions.",1355702400,4,919,4.974025974025974
204768,5,1938948289,"All I can say is ""Wow!""

I encountered this DVD series in Haiti a few weeks ago when I went on a missions trip. Our host family wanted to walk us through poverty alleviation and talk about common misconceptions the good willed American Christian has. I immediately fell in love with the series and purchased my own copy for home use as soon as I got back to the states. I'm now leading a group of guys through the series. Not only is the series full of useful info but it's also put together very well. If you're the least bit interested in learning about poverty alleviation, this series is for you.",1370217600,,600,4.357142857142857
204769,5,1938948289,"As a social worker and public administrator who has evaluated countless state and federally funded programs anyone getting a degree in a social sector field MUST watch this. If for no other reason than your entire program (if it is anything like mine) will not even mention these ideas. Where, based on my experiences we have to be waaaaay more thoughtful about how we try to help people. In countless ways I have seen the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of top-down programs and aid; especially in how they can breed unintended consequences that only end up requiring more aid, and create huge cycles of unending poverty. Good intentions are completely destructive if not coupled with true knowledge and wisdom. Period.

Anyways, in this video series they do a great job maintaining a message of compassion and empathy for the hurting while facing the question honestly about how we can actually help and what it actually means for humanity to thrive. If just the beginning I really hope this series helps shape the public conversation especially when it comes to the polarized nature of for-profit = bad and non-profit = good. The fact is, wherever greed, pride, materialism, and narcism are found they corrupt; whether in business, government, or philanthropy.

Though it left me wanting more philosophical meat regarding what it means to be, ""Made in the image of God"" I think it is perfect as a primer to going deeper and further. I really appreciate the fact they filmed this all over the world and talked with people in interviews who are ""in the tranches"" so-to-speak. I also really like the point that ""if you teach a man to fish you feed him for life"" assumes he at least has access to the pond. Equality of opportunities vs. outcomes debate entered here.

This series is engaging, well-filmed, and perfect for stimulating the type of dialogue we need to dig deeper into what it means to truly love others by seeking what is good for them based on their nature as fellow human beings.

As a small business owner and entrepreneur I found my purpose.  We as a company  have always been giving and supportive to  the needs of others, however I did not realize the impact we could have by sharing what we have learned in business with other business owners in other parts of the world.  The DVD series not only showed me a better way to serve, it forced me to look at my own business and how I needed to make changes myself. We are all the same in Gods view  and we all need help and support.  I am so thankful to have come across the PovertyCure series and look forward to putting what I learned into action.

204771,5,1938948289,"If we truly want to help the poor, and not just feel good about helping the poor, there are serious questions we must ask.

204772,5,1938948289,"I ordered this after reading the information on the website. I was excited to see what the series was covering. I have read the book ""When Helping Hurts"" and feel that it is a compliment to the book but the DVD series explores more in depth the way that wealth creation answers many of the issues people in poverty face. Poverty is much more than lack of material possessions. When we view people in poverty as ""poor"" then we are not correctly seeing them. When we view people in poverty as created in the image and likeness of God to be the solution...then we are seeing correctly. The series highlights wealth creation through entrepreneurship but also ventures to shed light on the complexities of how wealth is created. Accessability to the global market often limits businesses in developing countries. Government subsidies often destroy competition with emerging markets and open the door for corruption through cronyism. Overall, this series has been very eye opening to the harsh realities of poverty but also gives great hope for today. I would love to see a follow up to this series focusing on poverty in developed countries such as the USA, Canada, and European countries.",1368057600,,1184,4.895522388059701

204774,5,1938948289,"The PovertyCure curriculum contains stories and voices of poverty fighters and entrepreneurs around the globe. This fact cannot be overstated. What's at stake is nothing other than a reframing of how we think about poverty and social justice, and it's vital that voices we don't often hear - of ethnic minorities and from countries outside North America - are heard in the PovertyCure series calling for things like rule of law, property rights, freedom, access to markets, and an end to unproductive aid campaigns.

To my network of Evangelical Christians who are passionate about social justice, I say that the issues championed in PovertyCure are not pet concepts of a sub-section of thinkers in the West, but universal. People in developing communities around the world - and in the U.S. - need what all of us need. As an example, when Ghanaian entrepreneur Herman Chinery-Hesse notes the importance of private property ownership in starting a business, he is only pointing out something that we in the United States take for granted - that we have access to capital through resources that are properly titled and recognized by banks and the courts. Something as simple as proving ownership to what is in your possession is a luxury for many people around the world, not a right nor a fact.

Insights that are this basic - and yet often overlooked - are what PovertyCure excels at. Things we've forgotten or take for granted are what people around the world need. What worked for us can work for many others, and PovertyCure reminds us - or, for some, challenges us to think - that the very things that brought the U.S. from poverty into prosperity are the same things that can lift up developing nations and communities.

These affirmations don't discount serious issues like economic injustice, racial prejudice and racism, ethnic conflict, and toxic and self-serving politics. We need to protest and fight against unjust systems. PovertyCure reminds us that we must also invest in the things that have been proven to lift people and nations out of poverty.",1366156800,6,2063,4.956647398843931

It is an extremely educational and entertaining work that kept me engaged throughout the series. My 7th grade son watched the series with me as well and he felt like he had a much better understanding of what we are doing and also about poverty and ways to help vs. hurt.

204777,5,1938948289,This series is good for anyone to use and understand the need to assist those economically disadvantaged to be able to reach their potential and become useful citizens.

7802135,5,1938948289,"The Poverty Cure video course has been produced by PovertyCure, an international network of organizations and individual seeking to ground our common battle against global poverty in a proper understanding of the human person and society, and to encourage solutions that foster opportunity and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit that already fills the developing world.
People around the world are well aware that there is tremendous economic inequality and huge numbers of people that live in extreme poverty. Because of that, governments as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private charities, and individuals have contributed money and goods to attempt to solve the problem. PovertyCure reports that during the past 60 years, the developed world has sent more than two trillion dollars in assistance to poor countries. 
This video series takes an unusual approach to the issue. Host Michael Matheson Miller traveled all over the world to explore what works and what doesnt work in terms of poverty solutions. Miller does not just ask whether or not material or financial aid is getting to those who need it. He digs deeper to find out whether the aid is truly helpful or whether it causes harm through unintended consequences. Presented from a Christian perspective, the series examines the impact of aid or other forms of assistance on people with concern that people be seen as more than just mouths that need to be fed. The series continually emphasizes both the dignity and creativity of individuals. The poor are often willing to work very hard if they can see that there is the possibility of improving their situation.
In Poverty Cure, Miller interviews a number of people who came from extreme poverty but were able to become entrepreneurs, some even growing their businesses to a point where they can employ others. He also interviews political and religious leaders along with those who work with organizations to solve the problems of poverty.
Miller identifies obstacles that prevent the poor from escaping from their situation, obstacles such as a lack of property rights, the lack of the rule of law in their country, and injustice. He also looks at globalization, looking at both the dangers and opportunities it presents for the poor.
Educational challenges are also addressed. James Tooley, whose work I am familiar with through his intriguing book titled The Beautiful Tree, provides insight on educational solutions. Tooleys research has shown that government-funded schools for the poor in countries such as India and Africa often provide a very poor education. Indigenous entrepreneurs with little to no funding have started their own private schools that have flourished outside the regulatory boundaries to provide a real education to some of the poor who are most desperate to have their children escape the cycle of poverty.
Microfinance to help the poor start their own businesses receives high praise along with some cautions about its implementation. Miller also looks at how local churches in poor countries can influence both their congregation and their local culture by encouraging thrift, honesty, and enterprise.",1401235200,,3162,5.298804780876494

Pros:
You'll meet wonderful people from around the developing world and hear incredible stories. Their discussion of micro loans helped spark some new ideas in our own work.

Cons:
I wish there was more emphasis on how churches can actually 'reach' people in poverty - especially for communities in generational poverty in the US. They may have felt that it was outside the scope of their project, but we definitely share the challenges of helping multi-cultural people right next door. Their final answer - for western church involvement - seems to be 'discussion' with people, but a lot more could be said about how to form these relationships and get real people engaged in solving their own unique problems. The church is the perfect environment for that to happen.",1372118400,,952,4.94375
7802139,5,1938948289,"For anyone who believes that poverty is essentially lack of stuff or that the primary cure for poverty is giving stuff to people who don't have it, this DVD series is for you. Instead of asking how to reduce poverty this video explores how the developing world has created prosperity for their families and communities.

The video series begins with a testimony from a Kenyan woman who remembers that as a little girl she noticed the shirt she was wearing was manufactured in Kenya. Now she says with so many clothes give-aways from other nations flooding the market, all the local manufacturers have closed their doors.  An African medical supply manufacturer explains how his business suffers when shiploads of free medical supplies arrive and overwhelm the demand for his products. Shipments of free food drive down the prices of food so that local farmers can't make a profit. These ""gifts"" bankrupt local manufacturers, become a key cause of unemployment in the region, and create further dependency.

In the last twenty-five years world poverty rates have declined rapidly. What has caused this? Massive aid programs? Can you name a country that lifted itself out of poverty and became productive because of aid programs?

One issue the PovertyCure DVD series explores the issue of justice. They don't use the word justice as a synonym for a government using coercion to transfer wealth from one person to another. Even some Christians have fallen into these kinds of errors (like Ron Sider's Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger). Instead, PovertyCure gives evidence to show that when clear property rights and rule of law are present the foundation for economic development is established. In some countries as much as 70 percent of the land has no clear property title. Correcting these actual injustices has much more effect on a nation's poverty and development than aid programs.

The problem of the poor in the developing world isn't their exclusion from food or medical care, the problem is their exclusion from commercial systems, markets, circles of exchange, and networks of productivity. When these are present, the systems of food production, medical services, and education are created and maintained locally. Too often governments and other entities work to continue this exclusion of people local economic systems to lower the competition for their own services.

Community development is not just economic; a holistic approach is needed. The introduction of the gospel and the formation of  communities of believers in an area furthers a mutual trust, community orientation, hope for the future, sound moral foundation, strong family orientation, personal responsibility, and respect for others that is a necessary foundation for development. Without these any solution will only be temporary at best.

For those looking for a two-week project for your church to end poverty or ideas to host a fundraiser to create awareness of a specific problem you'll be disappointed in this series. For those looking to understand the foundation for community development and learn how many of our approaches actually cause harm this DVD series is worth watching.
