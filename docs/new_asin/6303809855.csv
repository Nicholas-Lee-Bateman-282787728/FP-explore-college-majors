705741,4,6303809855,"From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler (Marcus Cole, 1995)
While doing the research on this film, I discovered that there have actually been two film versions of E. L. Konigsburg's delightful novel, with this one being the more recent. Most reviewers seem to prefer the 1973 version. Maybe they're right. But not having seen it, I have to say I liked this one well enough as a trip down memory lane.
Veteran TV director Cole (Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder) directs from Betty Goldberg (Trapper John, M.D.)'s script. Cole casts Lauren Bacall as the mysterious and un-first-named Mrs. Basil, Jean Marie Barnwell (Angie) as Claudia, and Jesse Lee (Bobby of the newer Brady Bunch stuff) as Claudia's brother Jamie. The story, for those of you who have been living under a rock for thirty years: Claudia feels neglected at home and wants to run away. She enlists the help (and money) of younger brother Jamie. The two of them, through a series of minor misadventures, end up hiding in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Claudia becomes obsessed with a mysterious angel statue that may or may not have been carved by Michelangelo, and she sets about authenticating the piece.
Really, it's about what one would expect from a TV movie, in terms of direction, acting, etc. Nothing here that's going to win any awards. But who cares? For those of us who loved the novel, there's enough of it here to jog your memory (and hopefully you won't be too bogged down by the piece of it that mysteriously vanish). *** ",1054857600,8,1553,4.730627306273063
705742,5,6303809855,"I, as most of the other reviewers, began with the book as a child and saw the film later.  This was one of my favorite books as a child and I remember the film THE HIDEAWAYS that was made 30 years ago.  I loved the book and the THE HIDEAWAYS was okay, although it has some noticeable changes from the book.  When I purchased this more modern version of the book I did not think I would enjoy a more contempory version of the story.  I was wrong!  Sure there are some changes from the book but not enough to alter the story line greatly.  What I really enjoyed were the characters.  Lauren Bacall did a very good job in her role as Mrs. Frankweiler, as did Jean Marie Barnwell in the role of Claudia and Jesse Lee in the role of Jamie.
So, while there are some changes as others have noted, this film still maintains the best elements of the book.  I only wish more films adhered to the books from which their story was taken.  Also, this story stands up over time.  My 9 & 7 year old son & daughter enjoy this story as much as I did and still do.",1004745600,31,1046,4.058536585365854
705743,2,6303809855,"After reading E. L. Konigsburg's book, I was very excited to see this film adaptation of it.  But it's not all that great--I was very disappointed.  There are several differences between the movie and the book, one so much so that it ruined the whole picture for me.
The basic plot remains the same as the book: Claudia knew that she could never pull off the old-fashioned kind of running away...so she decided not to run FROM somewhere, but TO somewhere. And so, after some careful planning, she and her younger brother, Jamie, escaped.  Soon, while exploring the Muesum, they set their minds to solving the mystery of Angel, a statue new to the muesum's collection, rumored to have been created by the ledgendary Michaelangelo.
But several minor details were changed.  The entire character Saxonburg (although minor) has been deleted from the screenplay.  Also, because of this, the way that Claudia and Jamie do eventually get home is different.  (In the book, Saxonburg takes them home; here, their parents come and get them.)  Also here, Jamie puts in a phone call to Mom and Dad, which sturs things up a bit.  This was not done in the novel.  An assortment of other things have been changed as well.
Lauren Bascall does a nice job as Mrs. Frankwiler, and the rest of the casting is good.  But because of the changes from novel to screenplay, I dislike this version.  Read the book (of the same name; winner of the Newbery Medal) first.  Then try this, just to see how you like it.  Also try the film ""The Hideaways"", another film version of this story.  Hopefully it will be better!",978048000,19,1588,4.66546762589928
705744,4,6303809855,"Although there are quite a few minor changes in the story, children of 1999 will appreciate the faster movement of the plot than the older film with Ingrid Bergman. My third graders' interests lagged a bit with the  earlier version.  This one did a much better job of keeping their  attention. Good job!",934675200,8,303,4.679245283018868

Yes, I will use it again (next school year) because it is always a ""treat"" to watch the video on a book one just read and to compare the two.",1285632000,,341,3.927536231884058
