3963192,5,B002OOWLIY,"Soo.. its been over two years since the first season, which had only 15 episodes was released. Seriously Sony what is the hold up? If ever a time to continue releasing this show is now, since Valerie Bertinelli and Mackenzie Phillips are talked about alot alot now, more people would probably buy it because of that.. just give it a shot at releasing the second season and see how it does, I;m thinking it will do well. It would definetly restore some faith and love for Sony, which I don't have much of anymore.",1255651200,16,512,4.457446808510638

8376315,3,B002OOWLIY,"This 1976-77 Season is when this sitcom about a divorced single mother, Anne Romano  (Bonnie Franklin) raising 2 teenagers Julie  (Mackenzie Phillips) and Barbara  (Val Bertinelli) in a semi-slummy apartment in Ohio hit its stride.

It also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it every weekend on CBS as a kid too.

In the meantime, you can catch this 1975-84 show weekdays on Antenna-TV.",1475452800,,405,4.728571428571429

8376317,5,B002OOWLIY,"With the recent loss of the show's star, Bonnie Franklin, who played divorcee Ann Romano in the long-running sitcom series. I don't understand why the production companies have failed to re-issue the second season on DVD. It's been years since the first season was finally released.

This series was groundbreaking for many reasons in the 1970s about a newly divorced mother, Ann Romano, who chose to use her maiden name than her former husband's name and her two teenage daughters in urban Indianapolis, Indiana where they lived during the entire series. Pat Harrington Jr. played the building super Schneider who always brought comic relief and wisdom. New tenant is played by the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson, a cocktail waitress.

Still, I would love to see the second season again with perhaps an Intimate Portrait of Bonnie Franklin and Valerie Bertinelli in the specials feature or their reunion on television 30 years later. The show was also memorable for casting Mark Hamill as Schneider's nephew. The series brought humor, warmth, realism, and love to help understand the series and ourselves as well.

Nobody expected this show to survive the first season much less thrive and succeed for eight more seasons. Please release the entire series on DVD for the demanding public.",1366156800,2,1286,5.114285714285714
8376318,5,B002OOWLIY,"""One Day At A Time"" has been one of my all-time favorite TV series ever since its debut back in 1975. Frankly, it started out with me watching because Valerie Bertinelli was so adorable. But there are many TV shows which star pretty girls, and most of them do not hold up beyond one season, let alone nine. It takes special qualities for a show to last, beyond the charisma of a single cast member.""One Day At A Time"" had it all: A great ensemble cast, clever dialogue and topical stories.
I recently lost all of my VHS home-recorded videos of the entire ""One Day At A Time"" series due to a catastrophe, and I was just morosely pondering whether I would ever be able to replace them by someday buying the DVD versions of the show. But lo and behold, only Season #1 was ever released on DVD, way back in 2007. That means the rest of the series will probably never be released on DVD. It's all about ""the metrics,"" isn't it? The Hollywood studios that produced old shows like this can make much bigger profits nowadays by simply selling them as ""digital downloads."" Sell a whole season of shows via download for the same price as a boxed set of DVD's but no costly DVD manufacturing to cut into the profits! Nevermind that a classic show like ""One Day At a Time"" will naturally appeal to folks who are in the 50+ age range and tend to be more ""old school"" about entertainment technologies, preferring something tangible like a boxed set of DVD's over a digital download file which can be corrupted or more easily lost if your computer crashes or gets stolen. It's the same mentality that went into why ""TV Guide"" stopped printing a hardcopy edition and became exclusively on-line. The cynical marketers will tell you that ""this is what the Public WANTS."" But the reality is, this is what makes the biggest PROFITS, even if it discards the wishes of tens of millions of older consumers.
I'm not averse to a company making profits, but how foolish that they should pursue such limited avenues of doing so, while ignoring obvious alternative markets that can be served!",1352160000,9,2064,4.551075268817204
8376319,5,B002OOWLIY,I AM A HUGE FAN OF ONE DAY AT A TIME TV SERIES.PLEASE RELEASE THE REST OF THE SEASONS ON DVD.WHY WOULD SONY PUT OUT SEASON 1ON DVD.AND NOT THE REST OF THE SEASONS ON DVD.PLEASE RELEASE THE REST ON DVD.SO FANS CAN BUY THEM.THANK YOU.MAGDALENA HOLLY,1335225600,2,247,4.276595744680851
8376320,5,B002OOWLIY,"It's insane that a beloved and outstanding show like ""One Day at a Time"" waits years for the release of its subsequent seasons, while Sony Home Entertainment (which owns ""One Day"") couldn't wait to release the likes of  ""My Big Fat Greek Life, the Complete Series,"" a critical and popular failure by any standards.  Universal is no better, quickly releasing ""My Own Worst Enemy, the Complete Series,"" while other shows--shows which actually were well-received by both audiences and critics--seemingly wait forever for DVD release.  I have to wonder who actually makes the decisions regarding which television products are worthy of the investment and effort of home-video release, and which are not.  They must be the most clueless people in the entertainment industry.

By the way (since this is supposed to be a review): Seasons 2 & 3 are the very finest of the ""One Day at a Time"" series.  Season One was very much about Ann Romano's post-divorce relationship with David Kane.  With David out of the picture now, Seasons 2 & 3 give the show's creators and actors a chance to really develop the character of Ann, and even more so, Julie and Barbara Cooper.  In these seasons, Julie and Barbara, as played by Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli, become full-fledged characters in their own right, perfect prototypes of the seventies teenager of a single parent family.  Sometimes you want to strangle them, sometimes you want to hug them, but they're never anything less than completely enthralling.  If this item ever actually makes it to DVD, all I can say is: buy it.  Bonnie Franklin's performance alone is worth every penny, and the supporting cast and writing is every bit as excellent.",1310428800,19,1699,4.968197879858657
8376321,5,B002OOWLIY,It has been 2 years now since I purchased season 1 of One Day at a Time. This was my all time favorite show as a kid. Will season 2 ever be released or am I patiently waiting in vain? What's the hold up?,1304208000,3,203,3.6363636363636362
8376322,5,B002OOWLIY,"In April 2007, Sony brought us the long-awaited debut of ""One Day a Time"" on DVD.

This abbreviated season originally ran on CBS during 1975-76 and became an instant hit, with Bonnie Franklin's portrayal of Ann Romano being notable as prime time's first divorced leading lady (actually Lee Grant in ""Fay"" preceded her by a few months, but that show was quickly cancelled and erased from most viewer's memories). I was afraid that I would find Richard Masur's character annoying and he would taint my enjoyment of Season 1, but he was much better than I remember and these episodes went down smooth as ice cream and left me wanting more.

When I think of ODAAT, it's Season 2 that immediately springs to mind, due to the addition of the fabulous Mary Louise Wilson as sassy cocktail waitress neighbour Ginny Wrobliki. Wilson's acid tongue and razor-sharp wit made for a truly memorable character who was like a younger, sexier version of Maude. Her debut in ""The Upholstery Ripoff"" is my favorite ODAAT episode ever! Also not to be missed are her appearances in the episode with Schneider's thieving nephew (Mark Hamill) and when Schneider himself decides to pop the question to Ginny at a party--and she flatly turns him down in front of everyone!

The classic New Years' Eve show where the cast perform at a nursing home and MacKenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli perform ""Don't Go Breakin' My Heart"" is a Must-See for '70s nostalgia and kitsch value.

Please Sony, if you have no interest in releasing this (or additional) seasons of ODAAT, at least license it out to the wonderful folks at Shout! Factory, who are considered saviours by all fans of Classic TV.",1284681600,13,1666,4.814685314685315
8376323,5,B002OOWLIY,"All who have posted before me on this show, One Day At A Time, stand in agreement. This was a great show, someone thought so cause it lasted forever almost. I truly believe that these production companies are trying to sell the vile, disgusting, immoral, uninteresting shows first. It is so obvious. When they saw how well the good wholesome old classics sold, all of a sudden, they mysteriously stopped putting them out. But all the other junk shows ARE comming out! DO NOT give in and buy them. Let them sit on the store shelves where they belong and bring back some decency to America. Notice there are no good family tv shows on t.v. anymore? Only on tv land, hallmark, nick, and even they are starting to add more junk shows and not the old classics. Gotta fight for what's right! Anyway, this was a funny, funny,feel good, show with great actors. Maybe Valerie Bertinelli can yell at them!!!!",1282608000,8,898,4.583850931677019
