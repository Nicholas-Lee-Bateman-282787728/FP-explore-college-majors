8023574,1,B00028489O,"I ordered the classic The Birds by Hitchcock as part of larger order, specifically requested that the whole order be sent together to avoid several postage fees, which was ignored, and I was charged for the full amount of postage (to AUSTRALIA). When the DVD finally arrived it was not the movie, but a documentary about birds, despite the cover being the same as the one featured on the website. Not happy, and fast losing faith in Amazon!!! I hope you fix this up, as I see I'm not the only one this has been done to!
