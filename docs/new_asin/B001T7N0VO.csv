As a result, they haven't been remastered using the original film, so the DVDs being sold are made from one master copy (VHS possibly) that hasn't been renewed in over 30 years. The result is dark, drab blurry video quality and muffled audio. A remastering would greatly benefit the movie. The full version of the film was 1 hour 59 minutes.

8340759,1,B001T7N0VO,This DVD release is heavily cut. A number of sex scenes were either shortened or removed. The only saving grace is that it has subtitles.,1338940800,,137,4.52
8340760,4,B001T7N0VO,"I too wish this classic early 1980's Philippine movie would get noticed enough to warrant a remastering. The quality of what is available today is what is on the DVD that seems to be the only one sold. It's dark and the audio tends to sound like it has been re-recorded many times over. Still,  . .  this is a movie worth experiencing. The intensity of living in a Manila slum is all throughout the movie; there's hardly a moment in the movie when there is silence: if it's not a neighbor's radio, it's the cats calling or fighting (constantly throughout the movie), or people talking, singing or playing basketball.  The cat sounds - - constantly in the background  - come to represent the base, animal urges that the young man and his neighbor's wife have for each other. The sexual encounters are intense, as intense as the oppressive poverty they live in. Great period film, with some pretty good guitar and 80's songs sung by one of the characters. Excellent cinematography.

I read that this film made it past the censors in the Philippines only because Ferdinand Marcos, the president at the time, was in political trouble and it was thought a movie with hot, steamy sex would give the people something to enjoy and forget the nation's troubles for a while.",1313798400,,1264,4.650224215246637
8340761,3,B001T7N0VO,"This is a good depiction of life in a poor neighborhood in Manila, in addition to it's much heralded sex scenes. However, the film is of such poor quality, it loses the effect of what it is trying to portray. This is a film that needs remastering before going on DVD. A better choice would be the Korean movie ""Summer Time"" which is exactly the same story but takes place in a small town in Korea and with decent cinematography. Another quirk of this DVD is that you can't jump directly to the movie. They force you to watch a bunch of ""Grade Z"" previews in succession for about 15 minutes.",1309737600,,590,4.324324324324325
