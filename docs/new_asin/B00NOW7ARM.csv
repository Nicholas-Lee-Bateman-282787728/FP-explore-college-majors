6674191,3,B00NOW7ARM,"While not a completely awful movie, there is no way this is a five star film.  First of all, it would have been better as a short film.  You could cut out a majority of the stuff with the weird cat movie.  I get how it helps bring Jamie to the end, but it wasn't as funny as the people who made this film probably thought it was when they put it in.  And if that Jose guy is from Brazil, how come they're speaking Spanish?  Don't they speak Portuguese?Or did he just say that for the waxing line?

I'd say the best parts of this movie were the scenes of Jill and Jamie alone talking or slapping each other.  They were kind of sweet actually and didn't make me feel like I'd totally wasted my money on the rental.  Plus, there were a couple of good lines in there.  The thing about how women don't put out at a political rally made me laugh.  And the movie does have this vibe to it like it's a kid dancing to it's own beat and not caring who saw it.  It doesn't always look the best and doesn't really make for the greatest film, but you can connect with where it's coming from and kind of want to dance along.  I liked that the actors were regular people too, although I kinda want to give the actress who played Jill a sandwhich or something.

I like to support queer film making, but I also feel like we should support quality products and not just support things blindly.  So my advice is if you want to watch this, wait for Netflix or Prime or whatever.",1425945600,4,1458,4.106007067137809
6674192,5,B00NOW7ARM,I love everything about this movie. It's hilarious. Good job ladies.,1425772800,2,68,5.2727272727272725
6674193,4,B00NOW7ARM,"This is a silly, low-budget movie.  What I liked most about it was the main characters sense of humor.  Also, the actors are more true-to-life than the typical Hollywood film.  They aren't the most beautiful or sanitized.  I'm surprised but happy that this movie was even made since it appeals only to a narrow demographic.",1425168000,3,323,4.818181818181818
6674194,5,B00NOW7ARM,"A very clever idea, a sort of take on the movie Tootsie, that the writer/director makes the most of.  Michelle Ehlen also does a strong job in the lead.  A fun small budget indie film.",1417996800,5,184,4.228571428571429
6674195,5,B00NOW7ARM,"I thought that I wouldn't be able to get into this movie, because it's considered a ""Lesbian Comedy"", but I think anyone will be able to relate. I enjoyed the movie, and was entertained the whole time. I like how everyone, no matter what their sexuality/lifestyle, etc, is treated equally. Even the writer/director has some scenes where she is shown as less than perfect, and it's really funny. One of my favorite quotes is said during one of these moments, but I won't write it, here - could be a spoiler. I laughed, and i learned a few things about lesbians i didn't know before. There are some situations in this film I haven't seen represented before. Worth a watch, for sure.",1417564800,5,680,4.581967213114754
6674196,5,B00NOW7ARM,well worth five stars it's a shame lack of similar titles are about thank you.,1417478400,,78,4.266666666666667
6674197,5,B00NOW7ARM,I loved this movie - it is very funny and charming.  The cast was excellent - the two leads had great chemistry.  It really made the story believable and engaging.,1416960000,7,163,4.4

6674201,1,B00NOW7ARM,Dumb! If it were quirky like the movie Alto then dumb could be forgivable. It just tried to hard to be charming when it totally was not.,1472774400,,136,4.074074074074074
6674202,3,B00NOW7ARM,"Jill is trying to prove she is no longer a lesbian by dating her ex-girlfriend to show she is no longer interested in women. Not a bad movie, just not a great movie. Maybe I didn't like the idea of Jill using someone and playing with their feelings to figure out her own life, and maybe Jill was too self centered for me, and maybe it was just too long to rate more than three stars. I also take issue when one of the characters, Mary, says as a lesbian some people didn't like or accept her, but she definitely didn't want to be bisexual because then ""nobody likes you."" As a bi activist I resent all stereotypes and the belief that somehow bisexuals are stuck in the middle and are disliked by all social groups.",1472688000,,714,4.257352941176471
6674203,3,B00NOW7ARM,"IT was just alright, nothing to knock your socks off about",1443744000,,58,4.363636363636363
6674204,4,B00NOW7ARM,"It's sadly rare for American movies to be either funny or well-acted; Heterosexual Jill is both, plus poignant and astute and very clever. The story revolves around the complex not-quite-relationship between Jill and her old flame Jamie (played brilliantly by Michelle Ehlen, an actress we hopefully will see a great deal more often in future). Jill has succumbed to the notion that she can become an ex-lesbian with the help of her ""recovery"" group so she perversely seeks out her old lover Jamie so she can prove to herself that she's outgrown the whole lesbian thing.

But of course life doesn't work that way; nor does sexuality. Jill is a rather silly and self-centered character and if the film had revolved around her we'd rapidly have become bored. Instead the film adroitly sits on the shoulders of Jamie and as things progress we increasingly identify with her humanity and decency as she struggles to maintain some sort of emotional balance despite the fact that everyone around her is mad. Along the way there are moments of great humor both verbal and non-verbal, yet the humor always helps push the story forward and is never incidental as is so often the case with Hollywood comedy-by-numbers.

In short, even if you have zero interest in lesbians, romance, or trying to do the right thing while all around you go self-centeredly crazy, this is an absolute gem and will reward the time spent watching it.",1433548800,2,1419,4.859504132231405
6674205,3,B00NOW7ARM,Cute movie.,1430352000,,11,5.0
6674206,4,B00NOW7ARM,"This film was a delightful surprise, chiefly because of the performance of Michelle Ehlen. As a straight male, I usually have more difficulty empathizing with butch lesbian characters, who frequently seem distant and defensive; but I had no such trouble with Ehlen's Jamie, a sensitive, vulnerable, caring, unassuming and gentle soul. I was so impressed I ordered her previous film with the same character. I like Jamie.

I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because I found the tumultuous relationship between the main characters a little hard to follow. Nevertheless, while 5 stars are too many, 4 are too few. I recommend this title without reservation. Jamie will touch your heart.",1430006400,3,680,5.071428571428571
6674207,3,B00NOW7ARM,Not bad for a low budget film.  The acting was fine but script could have been much stronger.,1429660800,,93,4.166666666666667

8679534,1,B00NOW7ARM,This movie was really hard to watch because of the overacting and the boring writing. It had some redeeming moments but mostly not worth the watch.,1499558400,,147,4.6923076923076925
8679535,5,B00NOW7ARM,"This movie is hilarious but also some good messages.  I loved it for its entertainment value if nothing else.  Especially funny if you or someone you know is trying to ""deprogram"" from homosexuality.",1490918400,,199,5.0
