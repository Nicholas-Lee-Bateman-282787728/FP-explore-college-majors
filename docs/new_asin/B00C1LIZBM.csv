5685319,5,B00C1LIZBM,"Shake It Up: Mix It Up, laugh It Up is a 2013 Disney DVD compilation of the popular Disney Channel sitcom starring Zendaya as Rocky Blue and Bella Thorne as Cece Jones. The series involves Rocky(Zendaya)and Cece(Thorne)as best friends who learned that a new TV dance show is premiering in Chicago and the girls tryout, only to be challenged by the Hessenheffer siblings, Tinka(Caroline Sunshine)and Gunther(Kenton Duty), but Rocky and Cece always out-danced them in everyway! The special features includes sneak peeks of other Disney favourites like Planes, The Little Mermaid and The Muppet Movie Anniversary Edition. Shake It Up is one of the best Disney comedies to air on TV, and now, fans of the show will enjoy them on Disney DVD!",1377734400,5,736,4.991869918699187
5685320,5,B00C1LIZBM,"This is from Disney Channel.  My two preteen granddaughters love the singing.  The cast is talented, and good role models.  It's a fun show.  I like it too.  Disney quality acting.",1376611200,,180,4.67741935483871
5685321,4,B00C1LIZBM,"'Shake It Up' is a fresh, funny Disney Channel offering now in it's third season.  My two nieces are NUTS about the show, and as an adult I find its a pretty good series myself. Although the characters are the usual Disney stereotypes (one smart friend, one a bit dim; one cautious, the other a bit crazy; even the wise-cracking little brother) the actors give the roles charm and keep them from being boring.  The stories are good (and the lines genuinely funny) and in keeping with Disney tradition someone usually learns a lesson in the end - even when the opportunity is there to 'get away with it' CeCe and Rocky always come clean.  The dance sequences (there's at least one in each show) are very well choreographed.

Sadly this DVD release is not the entire first season, but a sort of 'best of' compilation.  The episodes chosen are good ones, but better ones are missing and the result is choppy when watching the DVD from start to finish.  At lease they included the pilot 'Start It Up' to give viewers an idea of what its all about. As for the extras...well, I can't write about them because they don't exist. Nothing.  I seem to recall Disney showing a 'behind the scenes' bit when the show first aired, introducing the actors and having them discuss their roles.  The set tour was led by Kenton Duty, who plays Gunter on the show.  It only ran about five or six minutes and would have been a nice inclusion, but no...

As an aside, when Disney first announced this release, the DVD had EIGHT titles listed.  Very quickly the info changed and 'Add It Up' (where the character of CeCe deals with her dyslexia) was removed.  I think this was a mistake since it showed there was more depth to CeCe and explained some of her lack of academic achievement.

All in all, if you or someone you know likes this show I'd recommend this DVD.  The picture and sound are very sharp and clear, and the widescreen transfer well done.  Apart from the negative of not having very many episodes (and no extras) another point against this release is a lack of insert giving a synopsis of the shows.  Even my nieces would tell me 'I think that's the one where...' after they read the title.  An episode description would have cost noting to include and would have helped a lot.

Incidentally, ten additional  'Shake It Up' episodes are available on the Disney DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Geek-Charming-Two-Disc-DVD-Bonus-DVD-Best-Friend-Charm-Set/dp/B006JTS6XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Geek Charming (Two-Disc DVD + Bonus DVD + Best Friend Charm Set)</a>.  At least Disney picked different episodes then had already been issued on 'Geek Charming' for this new DVD, so we're spared a double dip.",1373414400,10,2739,4.900216919739696
