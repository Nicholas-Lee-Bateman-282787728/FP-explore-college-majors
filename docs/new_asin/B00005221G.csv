""Graduation Day Part 1"" Faith shoots Angel with a poison arrow. The only cure is Slayer blood. First Buffy tries to get Faith's blood, but ends up giving Angel her blood.
""Graduation Day Part 2"" Buffy, her friends, and all the students of Sunnydale High School prepare to battle the Mayor and his vampires.
- Graduation Day Part 2 has the best ending you could ever imagine. You don't know what you are missing.",1017964800,2,628,4.285714285714286

7929677,5,B00005221G,"This two-part finale to Series 3 of the hit show 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' is possibly one of the best finales ever made on a television series.  But then I say that about each season ender.  Here Buffy has to battle her dark side in the form of Faith, the pure slayer side of herself, the detatched non-human side of her personality.  This is done in a startlingly wonderful battle sequence - the best the series has ever managed in fact.
Of course, this wouldn't be a finale without things falling apart at the seams elsewhere, a clever hyperbole on graduation.  There's Angel dying from a poison arrow, Willow and Oz sharing their first night together, an awkward romantic experience and more than a few deaths.  All this adds up to a real corker that's not only intelligent and superbly acted but also a roller-coaster ride of a trip.
The long-term fans (like me, lol) will appreciate the scene where Angel drinks from Buffy in a scene that is disturbingly close to a love, or even a rape, scene.  There's also a message from Faith on things to come, something that was to confuse watchers for over a year until Dawn's arrival finally made it click into place.  Looking back at this episode now, with Giles giving Buffy her diploma and the screen fading out from a yearbook which states 'The Future Is Ours' also manages to pinpoint not only the poignancy of Buffy's life (tragedy was on the horizon) but also the ultimate achievement of 'surviving', in this case literally, high school.  Utterly magnificent.",1007683200,,1514,4.686792452830189
7929678,5,B00005221G,"The two-part ""Graduation Day"" that ended the third season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer provides the final volume in The Slayer Chronicles, which focuses on Faith the Rogue Slayer joining the Mayor in his Ascension.  Both parts were written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon.  Part 1 has Faith shooting Angel with a poisoned arrow.  The only cure is the blood of a Slayer, which sends Buffy after Faith for a fatal duel to the death.  Part 2 finds Buffy having to deal with the consequences of her battle with Faith and the Mayor's Ascension, when he will turn into a 60-foot demon serpent.  Also on the agenda is graduating high school, if only Buffy, the Scooby Gang and the rest of their class can survive the ceremony.  The final note of fun is that after the dust settles, Angel will be leaving Sunnydale for good.
After ending the second season of Buffy with the two-parts of ""Becoming,"" wherein the series reached its absolute height, it is still impressive to see what Whedon was able to come up with for season three.  The idea of Faith as a Rogue Slayer was a good one all by itself, but putting it together with the Mayor's quest for eternal power was a masterstroke.  We should stop being surprised by such things from Whedon, but we should not stop being appreciative of his efforts.  The man does quality work.",973468800,14,1331,4.582278481012659
