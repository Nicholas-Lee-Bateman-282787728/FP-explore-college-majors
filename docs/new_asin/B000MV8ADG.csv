8172526,3,B000MV8ADG,The film was surprisingly well done.  The real story line is not what these characters thought it was.,1453420800,,102,4.666666666666667
8172527,4,B000MV8ADG,"This is one of those films that is based on actual events - and they are nearly always quite removed from those actual events. However, if they are good - then I for one am normally quite pleased with the results and this is one of those films. Bristol in Connecticut is the setting for our hero `Little man' played with striking conviction by Tom Guiry (`Tigerland' and `Black Hawk Down'). He is trying to hold down a job and take care of his mother who is addicted to pain killers. However, try as he might he can only get low rent wages and then a mechanic friend offers him a turn at dealing in cannabis. At first he is reticent but then he has an about face and takes up the offer.

Coupled with best mate Corey and a gung ho attitude he takes to drug dealing like a city banker to hedge fund risks and before you know it he is looking to expand his empire. He also has a taste for the sort of ladies that do lap dancing. The police are also very interested in him especially Inspector Benson (David Zayas - he plays Angel in `Dexter'). What unfolds is a classic story of sex, drugs and re hab.

It is a very watchable film and although not much new ground is broken here it really does not matter as it is all done with such good intentions and the end results are actually quite credit worthy. This is not an action fest so if that is your bag then best to give a miss. I streamed this and was happily surprised with the whole thing - recommended.",1424476800,,1454,4.152482269503546
8172528,3,B000MV8ADG,"After State Property 2 and The Hillz this movie is kinda redundant, and there's probably some other reference points I should add that I can't remember, but it's watchably entertaining for the most part and has realism in the subtle detail. A few things that didn't make sense made the movie almost more trouble than it's worth though. First, the High Times reader guy, after he tells Little Man his weed is shwag and no one will buy it, says he can help him sell the stuff, but it's unclear whether he means the shwag or the higher quality stuff he has a contact for. After the cop can't file charges because he did an illegal search, why doesn't he have Little Man under constant surveillance? And when the informant coke dealer hands the cop some drugs, then they have some argument about money, I have no idea what that scene was at all. If this is supposedly a small town what would the benefit be of having this guy as an informant? Who would there be to inform on? How did Little Man get the paperwork on the black dealer's impending trial? Why did the cop make no effort to get Little Man to inform on his supplier since he obviously wasn't growing the stuff? After a while I kinda zoned out from all the unanswered questions.",1181692800,,1234,4.416666666666667
