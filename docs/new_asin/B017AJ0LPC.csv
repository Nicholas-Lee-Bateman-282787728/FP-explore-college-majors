Even with extra material, it can't possibly be correct. Come on Amazon. Never the less, 6 hours per disc means it is going to be pretty compressed.

Richard Dean Anderson plays Ernest Pratt, the vice-ridden author of the popular Nicodemus Legend dime novel series of the 19th century that everybody thinks is nonfiction because he writes them in the first person and poses for the cover art as his virtuous, abstemious, gentlemanly hero.  Then it turns out that the Nikola Tesla-esque scientist Janos Bartok has been building all of the imaginary gadgets featured in the books for real out in the boonies of Colorado, and so Pratt is forced to become his character with great comedic effect, such as having to give up whiskey, cigars and casual sex, and nearly getting lynched by former Confederate soldiers who also don't comprehend the concept of historical fiction.

7498250,4,B017AJ0LPC,"There are lots of reviews here about the quality of the series, so I won't add much more, only that when LEGEND first aired I LOVED the pilot, and rarely thought the subsequent series quite matched it, but I enjoyed it all the same and I'm glad now to have the DVD set.

There arealso comments about the ""quality of the transfer,"" which aren't quite accurate. The transfer per se is fine, from studio sources. The problem with the set is, as a money-saving move, CBS DVD decided to jam all the episodes onto two disks. This means the video files cannot be as big as they'd be if there were only two or four episodes per disk. Note too that Video-DVDs play at different speeds, depending on how much content they hold, with the variants being 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours. Subsequently, the episodes have been compressed one level lower than the happy minimum (4 episodes per disk) that most of us are used to.

Subsequently, the image will pixilate if you try to view it within a large frame, because there aren't enough DPI (dots per inch) for a high definition resolution. So the smaller the frame, the sharper the image.

For good or ill, then, this LEGEND DVD set (or a rip of its contents) is best watched on a computer, a tablet, a smartphone or any other screen that lets you resize the image, or that is small enough to give you a tight, clean picture.

The sound has obviously also been compressed, but, without getting technical, I daresay you'll notice that less, if at all.",1521158400,2,1490,4.446886446886447

Too happy & content lately? No pending IRS audit on the horizon? Has the neighbors dog stopped crapping in your yard? Is the overbearing boss at work acting too satisfied?

PS  Betcha didn't know that there is a Legend website. Well, actually its a Richard Dean Anderson website that has a Legend subsection. Thats where the following Excerpt from the Legend press kit was located, nifty huh?

Richard Dean Anderson returns to series television in this lighthearted action-packed western adventure series set in the closing decades of the 19th century. Produced by T.L. Productions and Gekko Film Corp, and distributed by Paramount Network Television for UPN, Legend is the first series from executive producer Michael Piller since he co-created UPN's new hit series, Star Trek: Voyager.

Anderson stars as Ernest Pratt, a gambling, womanizing, hard-drinking writer who has created a dashing literary hero, Nicodemus Legend, the main character in a wildly imaginative series of dime novels set in the dangerous, untamed West. Pratt has created Legend in his own image, and all the novels are written in the first person. Because of this, many readers believe that Ernest Pratt is Nicodemus Legend. The irony is that while Pratt himself is something of a lost soul, he has created in Nicodemus Legend a romantic hero who embodies all the optimism and creative spirit of America in the 1870s.

In the premiere episode, Pratt learns that someone has been impersonating his literary creation, Nicodemus Legend. A warrant has been issued in Sheridan, Colorado for Legend's arrest on charges of malicious mischief, theft of water rights, and disturbing livestock. Noting that, ""I am not, nor will I ever be, a man who disturbs livestock,"" Pratt travels to Sheridan to clear the name of his hero. In Sheridan, he meets the eccentric European scientist and inventor, Janos Bartok. Bartok is a great admirer of Pratt's clever Western tales, and has taken the liberty of ""borrowing"" the Legend persona in order to help the townspeople of Sheridan.

Pratt is cornered by the awkward situation and by Bartok's persistent efforts to convince him that he must take on Legend's identity. Bartok tells Pratt, ""Your celebrity has the power to give our enemies pause. My science can increase that reputation. And together, we will create the real Legend."" Pratt reluctantly agrees to assume the persona of his literary creation, Nicodemus Legend, and to live out the image he has created of an adventurous man dedicated to justice and science.

John de Lancie co-stars as the Hungarian scientist and creative genius, Janos Bartok. Also co-starring is newcomer Mark Adair Rios as Huitzilopochtli Ramos, Bartok's brilliant young associate scientist who is descended from Aztec kings. Bob Balaban portrays Harry Parver, the representative of Pratt's Eastern publishing company.

Later episodes of Legend feature many of the outlandish inventions which Bartok creates in his laboratory. Most of these inventions spring from Bartok's own visionary mind, a few are inspired by Pratt's novels, but they are all fascinating and many are well ahead of their time. The audience is treated to such creations as the first All-Terrain Vehicle, which Bartok has named the ""Bartok Steam-Powered Town and Country Quadrovelocipede"" (and which Pratt calls simply a ""Land Rover""). Electro-fulminators (lightning bolt-transmitters) and a fully functioning pair of wings which enable Legend to reach normally inaccessible places are just a few of the wonderful and useful inventions of Bartok.

Michael Piller, Bill Dial, Richard Dean Anderson, and Michael Greenburg, the executive producers of Legend have combined experience in virtually all the television formats: half-hour comedies, one-hour detective stories, science fiction, and dramatic television movies. All this producing experience is invaluable on Legend, a show which combines action sequences with special effects, stunts, historic characters and setting, and high-tech optical effects, not to mention Richard Dean Anderson's previously untapped comedic talent.",1495497600,5,4467,5.356633380884451

7498281,5,B017AJ0LPC,"I wasn't sure what to expect but with Richard Dean Anderson & John DeLancie the stories come to life. You can't help remember ""MacGyver"" and you want this western character to be a bit more like that kind of strengths. This character is more a happy go lucky to the world and not really interested in becoming the fictional book character he writes western adventures for. John DeLancie's character puts you in mind of Doc Brown from ""Back to the Future"". Perhaps by the time I finish watching the remaining shows, maybe it gets better than I anticipate. It's still worth your time to step back in time during the western period of Colorado and all places west of the Rockies.",1494115200,,676,4.595041322314049

7498293,5,B017AJ0LPC,"While Legend only lasted half a season, the series has proven to be memorable for its fans. The theme song is great, the stories are well-thought out, and one can tell that everyone put a great deal of work into this show.

Richard Dean Anderson and John DeLancie make a great comic duo and leads and the stars of the western series parody. And parody is the right word. Episodes jump around with a tongue in cheek attitude as the series self parodies both Nicodemus's character and the situations he finds himself in.

It truly was an innovative series, but sadly cancelled. Richard Dean Anderson was about to start his run on Stargate after finishing Legend. And DeLancie would continue on with his ""Q"" appearances on Star Trek.  Far more preferable than today's overly serious shows.

The characters are better rounded than in most TV shows, and the interaction between Legend and Bartok is great fun.

Anderson shows some of the traits which will endear him to millions in the later series Stargate: SG-1 (which I also love).

If you are a fan of either actor, sci-fi in general, or just like fun TV, minus most of the heavy propagandizing (there is always some), then check this out. For less than the price of a movie ticket, you'll get 12 episodes of good fun.

On an obscure info note, I find it interesting that Anderson is in two consecutive sci-fi shows which deal with the related themes of advanced technology in the 1800s and the Breakaway Civilization (and if you don't understand why those are related, read Richard Dolan, Walter Bosley, Joseph Farrell, etc.).",1471996800,3,951,4.682634730538922

While only 12 episode's in length with a total run time of just under 10 hours it is delightfully funny. He and  John De Lancie (Q from Star Trek The Next Generation) play off each other very well. Too bad that it was not picked up for more than one season.

I watched the set on a 10 year old DVD player and TV set and the show was flawless. If anyone experiences artifacts or pixelization issues it's most likely how their equipment does the scaling. At both 480i and 480p the show looked wonderful.

He is TERRIBLE! He can't act AT ALL! If you don't hate him, keep in mind that this is a pretty light-hearted show. Historical figures often play an important role in the plots and there are jokes made about them that seem funny because we(the viewers) know how history played out.

It was at times very creative and others a bit cheesy, both in keeping with the plot of the episode at the time. I wouldn't say it's the best RDA has done, but it is lighthearted and entertaining, often very humorous. John de Lancie's character does a great job of showing enthusiasm for each of his inventions with the full confidence that they will work as planned. His ability to guide the laidback (dare I say lazy?) Pratt into the person he created in the heroic Legend is great. Sometimes all anyone needs to do more with their lives is someone who believes they can be encouraging them along the way. Not necessarily the Old West, but definitely a fun one. 12 episodes for under $10.00 is a great deal. Still beats most of what's on TV for families today, try it!",1461801600,10,946,4.442528735632184

At that time, our cable company didn't get UPN. Too bad. Then years later, someone on an RDA forum, made me some copies of Legend, on DVD so I got to see them. But I'm glad I got the REAL DVDS. Much better quality. The shows are really funny, and I love seeing Richard in a different show other than MacGyver, and SG. He did a good job in Legend. He showed his comedic side.

The good news is that this show is finally available on DVD. The bad news is that the quality of the set it HORRID. Actually, horrid is a generous description. This is one of the worst transfers to DVD I have ever seen. Very often the interlacing is so badly out of sync as to make the image undiscernible. Even when the interlacing is not so far out of sync, details (such as the lettering in the titles) are difficult to read due to artifacting which makes the text seem as if there are a second and third set of characters, out of alignment with the first. This is without a doubt one of the WORST digital transfers I've ever seen. I don't know who is responsible for the digital transfer and mastering, and approving the release of this product in its current state, but I hope they've been fired and black-balled within the industry.

A labor of love of Richard Dean Anderson, star of MCGYVER  and STARGATE, it shows in every frame.

He plays Ernest Pratt,a much less scrupulous man then his creation, the heroic and honorable Nicodemus Legend. When he is forced to ""become"" Legend, he is helped by the somewhat eccentric mad genius, Janos Bartok,wonderfully played by John de Lancie whom trekkies know as the redoubtable super being Q, who has at his disposal a bevy of HG Wells type of technology.

As a writer, I love author Ernest Pratt and his dealings with his demanding publisher. The actors seem to be having a barrel of fun. Sharp dialogue, quotable lines (""when all else fails, bring out the Legend wings"") and jibes at modern day foibles and prejudices, but the satire never gets campy. But the packaging gets only one star. The casing is flimsy and breaks easily. The picture quality is like a second-generation VHS copy. The color is way off (and it isn't my TV set). In the pilot, every frame is washed in a brown tint. Later episodes are too heavy on the reds; the skin tones look like sunburn. The background sounds have been amped so much they drown out the dialogue. Worse of all, the original theme music has been substituted with a weak imitation! What the--? Couldn't the studio pay a few dollars for ASCAP rights to the original? And no extras! C'mon, couldn't they at least get an interview with the producers or Richard Dean Anderson?

While I have always liked Anderson, this is one role that he should have turned down. MacGyver and Stargate SG-1 were his best roles. MacGyver had been over as a series for three years and while two movies were produced in 1994, this was Anderson's first real work in a new character. Unfortunately, his character was uninspired and somewhat boring. At least we now have the series available for the first time since it aired.

Getting back to mediocre television. Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) did not compare to the original series and UPN's production values simply were not in place. The opening two-part to TNG lacked bonified special effects and for the first few shows, were basically reruns of shows previously done on the original series.

Nowhere Man aired just before TNG, if memory serves, and was a captivating show. Legend had the potential, but lacked the charm that Anderson typically brought to his roles. I wish I could give this series a better review, but it tends to drag.

The picture quality is not up to par and varies from fuzzy (opening shot in the first episode) to okay, but is typical of Mill Creek, and lacks any kind of subtitles, including closed captioning. CBS now has the rights, but the care they give to most of their shows is lacking in this set.

If you like Anderson, stick to MacGyver and his Stargate appearances. If you like de Lancie, this is okay, but Back to the Future's Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd is light years better in this kind of quirky scientist inventor role.",1452038400,3,1807,4.80064308681672

8738499,5,B017AJ0LPC,"What could better that RDA playing the slightly larger than life Nicodemus Legend and the writer of his novels, Ernest Pratt?  Well, the actor that personified 'Q' playing a thinly veiled Tesla-wannabe.
- Consider Legend a less violent ""Brisco County Jr."", if you will, crossed with a more up-to-date ""Wild, Wild West"".  The wonderful teaming of Anderson and de Lancie hold it all together nicely.  The stories are mostly solid, the guest casting is solid and the music is very good.
- I am enjoying this, as I missed it on the original telecasts in '95.  I am glad I purchased this!

Note: other reviews have noted poor picture and garbage packaging.
  1) the packaging is modern plastic packaging, not fancy but functional, holding two discs
  2) the video quality is better than described.  I noticed no such issues with my 32"" Philips HD TV and Philips DVD player.
  3) the material is bare bones, no production videos or extras.  You can Play All and Choose Episodes . . .

8738500,5,B017AJ0LPC,This was such a fun show.  Richard Dean Anderson is great in anything and this one was so different and full of surprises. John DeLancie was his creative genius as always.  A lot fun actors were guests. I was soooooooooo disappointed they didn't renew the series. It would have been so much fun to see how it could grow creatively and see all the crazy adventures Legend and Bartok journeyed on. Jarrad Paul was adorable and Ramos was a great addition to the group.  Still never understood why they didn't continue for at least a couple more seasons. I am happy to have the DVD set finally. Wish they'd bring it back. Great job.,1534118400,,628,4.491228070175438
